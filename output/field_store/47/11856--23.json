So far as I know, the Commandant-General was  satisfied with my work. On the day after the fight I met an attache.  He spoke in French, of which language I know nothing. My Gallic  friend then tried to get on in English, and congratulated me in the  following terms with the result of the fight: \"I congratuly very much  you, le General; we think you good man of war.\" It was the first time  I had bulked in anyone's opinion as largely as a battleship; but I  suppose his intentions were good enough.    A few days afterwards Lord Roberts sent a hundred women and children  down the line to Van der Merwe Station, despite Botha's vehement  protests. It fell to my lot to receive these unfortunates, and to send  them on by rail to Barberton, where they could find a home. I shall  not go into a question which is still _sub judice_; nor is it my  present purpose to discuss the fairness and unfairness of the war  methods employed against us. I leave that to abler men. I shall only  add that these waifs were in a pitiful position, as they had been  driven from their homes and stripped of pretty nearly everything they  possessed.    Towards the end of July Carrington marched his force to Rustenburg,  and thence past Wonderboompoort, while another force proceeded from  Olifantsfontein in the direction of Witbank Station. We were,  therefore, threatened on both sides and obliged to fall back on  Machadodorp.          CHAPTER XVIII.    OUR CAMP BURNED OUT.      The beginning of August saw my commandos falling back on Machadodorp.  Those of Erasmus and Grobler remained where they were for the time  being, until the latter was discharged for some reason or other and  replaced by Attorney Beyers. General Erasmus suffered rather worse,  for he was deprived of his rank as a general and reduced to the level  of a commandant on account of want of activity.    Our retreat to Machadodorp was very much like previous experiences of  the kind; we were continually expecting to be cut off from the railway  by flanking movements and this we had to prevent because we had placed  one of our big guns on the rails in an armour-clad railway carriage.  The enemy took care to keep out of rifle range, and the big gun was  an element of strength we could ill afford to lose. Besides, our  Government were now moving about on the railway line near Machadodorp,  and we had to check the enemy at all hazards from stealing a march on  us. Both at Witbank Station and near Middelburg and Pan Stations we  had skirmishes, but not important enough to describe in detail.    After several unsuccessful attempts, the Boer Artillery at last  managed to fire the big gun without a platform. It was tedious work,  however, as \"Long Tom\" was exceedingly heavy, and it usually took  twenty men to serve it. The mouth was raised from the \"kastion\" by  means of a pulley, and the former taken away; then and not till then  could the gunner properly get the range. The carriage vacuum sucking  apparatus had to be well fixed in hard ground to prevent recoil.    The enemy repeatedly sent a mounted squad to try and take this gun,  and then there was hard fighting.    [Illustration: Fight With General Hutton at Olifantsfontein.]    One day while we were manoeuvring with the \"Long Tom,\" the veldt burst  into flames, and the wind swept them along in our direction like  lightning. Near the gun were some loads of shells and gunpowder, and  we had to set all hands at work to save them. While we were doing this  the enemy fired two pom-poms at us from about 3,000 yards, vastly to  our inconvenience.    As my commando formed a sort of centre for the remainder,  Commandant-General Botha was, as a rule, in our immediate  neighbourhood, which made my task much easier, our generalissimo  taking the command in person on several occasions, if required, and  assisting in every possible way.    The enemy pursued us right up to Wonderfontein Station (the first  station south-west of Belfast), about 15 miles from Dalmanutha or  Bergendal, and waited there for Buller's army to arrive from the Natal  frontier.    We occupied the \"randten\" between Belfast and Machadodorp, and waited  events. While we were resting there Lord Roberts sent us 250 families  from Pretoria and Johannesburg in open trucks, notwithstanding the  bitterly cold weather and the continual gusts of wind and snow. One  can picture to oneself the deplorable condition we found these women  and children in.    But, with all this misery, we still found them full of enthusiasm,  especially when the trucks in which they had to be sent on down the  line were covered with Transvaal and Free State flags. They sang our  National Anthem as if they had not a care in the world.    Many burghers found their families amongst these exiles, and some  heartrending scenes were witnessed. Luckily the railway to Barberton  was still in our possession, and at Belfast the families were taken  over from the British authorities, to be sent to Barberton direct.  While this was being done near Belfast under my direction, the  unpleasant news came that our camp was entirely destroyed by a grass  fire.    The Commandant-General and myself had set up our camp near Dalmanutha  Station. It consisted of twelve tents and six carts. This was Botha's  headquarters, as well as of his staff and mine. When we came to the  spot that night we found everything burned save the iron tyres of the  waggon wheels, so that the clothes we had on were all we had left us.  All my notes had perished, as well as other documents of value. I was  thus deprived of the few indispensable things which had remained to  me, for at Elandslaagte my \"kit\" had also fallen into the hands of the  British. The grass had been set on fire by a kaffir to the windward of  the camp. The wind had turned everything into a sea of fire in less  than no time, and the attempts at stamping out the flames had been of  no avail. One man gave us a cart, another a tent; and the harbour at  Delagoa Bay being still open (although the Portuguese had become far  from friendly towards us after the recent British victories) we  managed to get the more urgent things we wanted. Within a few days we  had established a sort of small camp near to headquarters.    We had plenty to do at this time--building fortresses and digging  trenches for the guns. This of course ought to have been done when we  were still at Donkerhoek by officers the Commandant-General had sent  to Machadodorp for the purpose. We had made forts for our \"Long Toms,\"  which were so well hidden from view behind a rand that the enemy had  not discovered them, although a tunnel would have been necessary in  order to enable us to use them in shelling the enemy. We were  therefore obliged to set to work again, and the old trenches were  abandoned. The holes may surprise our posterity, by the way, as a  display of the splendid architectural abilities of their ancestors.          CHAPTER XIX.    BATTLE OF BERGENDAL (MACHADODORP).      Let us pass on to the 21st of August, 1900. Buller's army had by this  time effected a junction with that of Lord Roberts' between  Wonderfontein and Komati River. The commandos under Generals Piet  Viljoen and Joachim Fourie had now joined us, and taken up a position  on our left, from Rooikraal to Komati Bridge. The enemy's numbers were  estimated at 60,000, with about 130 guns, including twelve 4.7 naval  guns, in addition to the necessary Maxims.    We had about 4,000 men at the most with six Maxims and about thirteen  guns of various sizes. Our extreme left was first attacked by the  enemy while they took possession of Belfast and Monument Hill, a  little eastward, thereby threatening the whole of our fighting lines.  My commandos were stationed to the right and left of the railway and  partly round Monument Hill. Fighting had been going on at intervals  all day long, between my burghers and the enemy's outposts. The  fighting on our left wing lasted till late in the afternoon, when the  enemy was repulsed with heavy losses; while a company of infantry  which had pushed on too far during the fighting, through some  misunderstanding or something of that sort, were cut off and captured  by the Bethel burghers.    The attack was renewed the next morning, several positions being  assailed in turn, while an uninterrupted gunfire was kept up. General  Duller was commanding the enemy's right flank and General French was  in charge of the left. We were able to resist all attacks and the  battle went on for six days without a decisive result. The enemy had  tried to break through nearly every weak point in our fighting line  and found out that the key to all our positions existed in a prominent  \"randje\" to the right of the railway. This point was being defended by  our brave Johannesburg police, while on the right were the  Krugersdorpers and Johannesburgers and to the left the burghers from  Germiston. Thus we had another \"Spion Kop\" fight for six long days.  The Boers held their ground with determination, and many charges were  repulsed by the burghers with great bravery. But the English were not  to be discouraged by the loss of many valiant soldiers and any failure  to dislodge the Boers from the \"klip-kopjes.\" They were admirably  resolute; but then they were backed up by a superior force of soldiers  and artillery.    On the morning of the 27th of August the enemy were obviously bent on  concentrating their main force on this \"randje.\" There were naval guns  shelling it from different directions, while batteries of field-pieces  pounded away incessantly. The \"randje\" was enveloped by a cloud of  smoke and dust. The British Infantry charged under cover of the guns,  but the Police and burghers made a brave resistance.

Though it's nice enough in some ways while it lasts!' he added, as if in  unwilling recognition of fact.  As the path debouched on the highroad he  said to himself half aloud:    'Well, she's a mighty fine girl, anyhow!  And if she is red I've had  about enough of the black! . . . That Spanish girl is beginning to kick  too!  I wish I had never come across . . . '    'Shut up, you fool!' he said to himself as he walked on.    When he got home he found a letter from his father.  He took it to his  room before breaking the seal.  It was at least concise and to the point:       'The enclosed has been sent to me.  You will have to deal with it     yourself.  You know my opinion and also my intention.   The items     which I have marked have been incurred since I spoke to you last about     your debts.  I shall not pay another farthing for you.  So take your     own course!       'JASPER EVERARD.'    The enclosed was a jeweller's bill, the length and the total of which  lengthened his face and drew from him a low whistle.   He held it in his  hand for a long time, standing quite still and silent.  Then drawing a  deep breath he said aloud:    'That settles it!  The halter is on me!  It's no use squealing.  If it's  to be a red head on my pillow! . . . All right!  I must only make the  best of it.  Anyhow I'll have a good time to-day, even if it must be the  last!'    That day Harold was in Norcester on business.  It was late when he went  to the club to dine.  Whilst waiting for dinner he met Leonard Everard,  flushed and somewhat at uncertain in his speech.  It was something of a  shock to Harold to see him in such a state.    Leonard was, however, an old friend, and man is as a rule faithful to  friends in this form of distress.  So in his kindly feeling Harold  offered to drive him home, for he knew that he could thus keep him out of  further harm.  Leonard thanked him in uncertain speech, and said he would  be ready.  In the meantime he would go and play billiards with the marker  whilst Harold was having his dinner.    At ten o'clock Harold's dogcart was ready and he went to look for  Leonard, who had not since come near him.  He found him half asleep in  the smoking-room, much drunker than he had been earlier in the evening.    The drive was fairly long, so Harold made up his mind for a prolonged  term of uneasiness and anxiety.  The cool night-air, whose effect was  increased by the rapid motion, soon increased Leonard's somnolence and  for a while he slept soundly, his companion watching carefully lest he  should sway over and fall out of the trap.  He even held him up as they  swung round sharp corners.    After a time he woke up, and woke in a nasty temper.  He began to find  fault in an incoherent way with everything.  Harold said little, just  enough to prevent any cause for further grievance.  Then Leonard changed  and became affectionate.  This mood was a greater bore than the other,  but Harold managed to bear it with stolid indifference.  Leonard was this  by time making promises to do things for him, that as he was what he  called a 'goo' fell',' he might count on his help and support in the  future.  As Harold knew him to be a wastrel, over head and ears in debt  and with only the succession to a small estate, he did not take much heed  to his maunderings.  At last the drunken man said something which  startled him so much that he instinctively drew himself together with  such suddenness as to frighten the horse and almost make him rear up  straight.    'Woa!  Woa!  Steady, boy.  Gently!' he said, quieting him.  Then turning  to his companion said in a voice hollow with emotion and vibrant with  suppressed passion:    'What was it you said?'    Leonard, half awake, and not half of that half master of himself,  answered:    'I said I will make you agent of Normanstand when I marry Stephen.'    Harold grew cold.  To hear of any one marrying Stephen was to him like  plunging him in a glacier stream; but to hear her name so lightly spoken,  and by such a man, was a bewildering shock which within a second set his  blood on fire.    'What do you mean?' he thundered.  'You marry Ste . . . Miss Norman!  You're not worthy to untie her shoe!  You indeed!  She wouldn't look on  the same side of the street with a drunken brute like you!  How dare you  speak of her in such a way!'    'Brute!' said Leonard angrily, his vanity reaching inward to heart and  brain through all the numbing obstacle of his drunken flesh.  'Who's  brute?  Brute yourself!  Tell you goin' to marry Stephen, 'cos Stephen  wants it.  Stephen loves me.  Loves me with all her red head!  Wha're you  doin'!  Wha!!'    His words merged in a lessening gurgle, for Harold had now got him by the  throat.    'Take care what you say about that lady! damn you!' he said, putting his  face close the other's with eyes that blazed.  'Don't you dare to mention  her name in such a way, or you will regret it longer than you can think.  Loves you, you swine!'    The struggle and the fierce grip on his throat sobered Leonard somewhat.  Momentarily sobbed him to that point when he could be coherent and  vindictive, though not to the point where he could think ahead.  Caution,  wisdom, discretion, taste, were not for him at such a moment.  Guarding  his throat with both hands in an instinctive and spasmodic manner he  answered the challenge:    'Who are you calling swine?  I tell you she loves me.  She ought to know.  Didn't she tell me so this very day!'  Harold drew back his arm to strike  him in the face, his anger too great for words.  But the other, seeing  the motion and in the sobering recognition of danger, spoke hastily:    'Keep your hair on!  You know so jolly much more than I do.  I tell you  that she told me this and a lot more this morning when she asked me to  marry her.'    Harold's heart grew cold as ice.  There is something in the sound of a  voice speaking truthfully which a true man can recognise.  Through all  Leonard's half-drunken utterings came such a ring of truth; and Harold  recognised it.  He felt that his voice was weak and hollow as he spoke,  thinking it necessary to give at first a sort of official denial to such  a monstrous statement:    'Liar!'    'I'm no liar!' answered Leonard.  He would like to have struck him in  answer to such a word had he felt equal to it.  'She asked me to marry  her to-day on the hill above the house, where I went to meet her by  appointment.  Here!  I'll prove it to you.  Read this!'  Whilst he was  speaking he had opened the greatcoat and was fumbling in the  breast-pocket of his coat.  He produced a letter which he handed to  Harold, who took it with trembling hand.  By this time the reins had  fallen slack and the horse was walking quietly.  There was moonlight, but  not enough to read by.  Harold bent over and lifted the driving-lamp next  to him and turned it so that he could read the envelope.  He could hardly  keep either lamp or paper still, his hand trembled so when he saw that  the direction was in Stephen's handwriting.  He was handing it back when  Leonard said again:    'Open it!  Read it!  You must do so; I tell you, you must!  You called me  a liar, and now must read the proof that I am not.  If you don't I shall  have to ask Stephen to make you!'  Before Harold's mind flashed a rapid  thought of what the girl might suffer in being asked to take part in such  a quarrel.  He could not himself even act to the best advantage unless he  knew the truth . . . he took the letter from the envelope and held it  before the lamp, the paper fluttering as though in a breeze from the  trembling of his hand.  Leonard looked on, the dull glare of his eyes  brightening with malignant pleasure as he beheld the other's concern.  He  owed him a grudge, and by God he would pay it.  Had he not been  struck--throttled--called a liar! . . .    As he read the words Harold's face cleared.  'Why, you infernal young  scoundrel!' he said angrily, 'that letter is nothing but a simple note  from a young girl to an old friend--playmate asking him to come to see  her about some trivial thing.  And you construe it into a proposal of  marriage.  You hound!'  He held the letter whilst he spoke, heedless of  the outstretched hand of the other waiting to take it back.  There was a  dangerous glitter in Leonard's eyes.  He knew his man and he knew the  truth of what he had himself said, and he felt, with all the strength of  his base soul, how best he could torture him.  In the very strength of  Harold's anger, in the poignancy of his concern, in the relief to his  soul expressed in his eyes and his voice, his antagonist realised the  jealousy of one who honours--and loves.  Second by second Leonard grew  more sober, and more and better able to carry his own idea into act.    'Give me my letter!' he began.    'Wait!' said Harold as he put the lamp back into its socket.  'That will  do presently.  Take back what you said just now!'    'What?  Take back what?'    'That base lie; that Miss Norman asked you to marry her.'    Leonard felt that in a physical struggle for the possession of the letter  he would be outmatched; but his passion grew colder and more malignant,  and in a voice that cut like the hiss of a snake he spoke slowly and  deliberately.  He was all sober now; the drunkenness of brain and blood  was lost, for the time, in the strength of his cold passion.    'It is true.  By God it is true; every word of it!  That letter, which  you want to steal, is only a proof that I went to meet her on Caester  Hill by her own appointment.  When I got there, she was waiting for me.  She began to talk about a chalet there, and at first I didn't know what  she meant--'    There was such conviction, such a triumphant truth in his voice, that  Harold was convinced.    'Stop!' he thundered; 'stop, don't tell me anything.  I don't want to  hear.  I don't want to know.'  He "]]]
