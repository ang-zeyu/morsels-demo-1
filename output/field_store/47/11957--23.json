Heavenly melody, in our then state of mind, would  only have still further harrowed us.  A soul-moving harmony, correctly  performed, we should have taken as a spirit-warning, and have given up  all hope.  But about the strains of \"He's got 'em on,\" jerked  spasmodically, and with involuntary variations, out of a wheezy  accordion, there was something singularly human and reassuring.    The sweet sounds drew nearer, and soon the boat from which they were  worked lay alongside us.    It contained a party of provincial 'Arrys and 'Arriets, out for a  moonlight sail.  (There was not any moon, but that was not their fault.)  I never saw more attractive, lovable people in all my life.  I hailed  them, and asked if they could tell me the way to Wallingford lock; and I  explained that I had been looking for it for the last two hours.    \"Wallingford lock!\" they answered.  \"Lor' love you, sir, that's been done  away with for over a year.  There ain't no Wallingford lock now, sir.  You're close to Cleeve now.  Blow me tight if 'ere ain't a gentleman been  looking for Wallingford lock, Bill!\"    I had never thought of that.  I wanted to fall upon all their necks and  bless them; but the stream was running too strong just there to allow of  this, so I had to content myself with mere cold-sounding words of  gratitude.    We thanked them over and over again, and we said it was a lovely night,  and we wished them a pleasant trip, and, I think, I invited them all to  come and spend a week with me, and my cousin said her mother would be so  pleased to see them.  And we sang the soldiers' chorus out of _Faust_,  and got home in time for supper, after all.                         [Picture: People in rowing boat]          CHAPTER X.      Our first night.--Under canvas.--An appeal for help.--Contrariness of  tea-kettles, how to overcome.--Supper.--How to feel virtuous.--Wanted! a  comfortably-appointed, well-drained desert island, neighbourhood of South  Pacific Ocean preferred.--Funny thing that happened to George's  father.--a restless night.    Harris and I began to think that Bell Weir lock must have been done away  with after the same manner.  George had towed us up to Staines, and we  had taken the boat from there, and it seemed that we were dragging fifty  tons after us, and were walking forty miles.  It was half-past seven when  we were through, and we all got in, and sculled up close to the left  bank, looking out for a spot to haul up in.    We had originally intended to go on to Magna Charta Island, a sweetly  pretty part of the river, where it winds through a soft, green valley,  and to camp in one of the many picturesque inlets to be found round that  tiny shore.  But, somehow, we did not feel that we yearned for the  picturesque nearly so much now as we had earlier in the day.  A bit of  water between a coal-barge and a gas-works would have quite satisfied us  for that night.  We did not want scenery.  We wanted to have our supper  and go to bed.  However, we did pull up to the point--\"Picnic Point,\" it  is called--and dropped into a very pleasant nook under a great elm-tree,  to the spreading roots of which we fastened the boat.    Then we thought we were going to have supper (we had dispensed with tea,  so as to save time), but George said no; that we had better get the  canvas up first, before it got quite dark, and while we could see what we  were doing.  Then, he said, all our work would be done, and we could sit  down to eat with an easy mind.    That canvas wanted more putting up than I think any of us had bargained  for.  It looked so simple in the abstract.  You took five iron arches,  like gigantic croquet hoops, and fitted them up over the boat, and then  stretched the canvas over them, and fastened it down: it would take quite  ten minutes, we thought.    That was an under-estimate.    We took up the hoops, and began to drop them into the sockets placed for  them.  You would not imagine this to be dangerous work; but, looking back  now, the wonder to me is that any of us are alive to tell the tale.  They  were not hoops, they were demons.  First they would not fit into their  sockets at all, and we had to jump on them, and kick them, and hammer at  them with the boat-hook; and, when they were in, it turned out that they  were the wrong hoops for those particular sockets, and they had to come  out again.    But they would not come out, until two of us had gone and struggled with  them for five minutes, when they would jump up suddenly, and try and  throw us into the water and drown us.  They had hinges in the middle,  and, when we were not looking, they nipped us with these hinges in  delicate parts of the body; and, while we were wrestling with one side of  the hoop, and endeavouring to persuade it to do its duty, the other side  would come behind us in a cowardly manner, and hit us over the head.    We got them fixed at last, and then all that was to be done was to  arrange the covering over them.  George unrolled it, and fastened one end  over the nose of the boat.  Harris stood in the middle to take it from  George and roll it on to me, and I kept by the stern to receive it.  It  was a long time coming down to me.  George did his part all right, but it  was new work to Harris, and he bungled it.    How he managed it I do not know, he could not explain himself; but by  some mysterious process or other he succeeded, after ten minutes of  superhuman effort, in getting himself completely rolled up in it.  He was  so firmly wrapped round and tucked in and folded over, that he could not  get out.  He, of course, made frantic struggles for freedom--the  birthright of every Englishman,--and, in doing so (I learned this  afterwards), knocked over George; and then George, swearing at Harris,  began to struggle too, and got _himself_ entangled and rolled up.    [Picture: Watching and waiting] I knew nothing about all this at the  time.  I did not understand the business at all myself.  I had been told  to stand where I was, and wait till the canvas came to me, and  Montmorency and I stood there and waited, both as good as gold.  We could  see the canvas being violently jerked and tossed about, pretty  considerably; but we supposed this was part of the method, and did not  interfere.    We also heard much smothered language coming from underneath it, and we  guessed that they were finding the job rather troublesome, and concluded  that we would wait until things had got a little simpler before we joined  in.    We waited some time, but matters seemed to get only more and more  involved, until, at last, George's head came wriggling out over the side  of the boat, and spoke up.    It said:    \"Give us a hand here, can't you, you cuckoo; standing there like a  stuffed mummy, when you see we are both being suffocated, you dummy!\"    I never could withstand an appeal for help, so I went and undid them; not  before it was time, either, for Harris was nearly black in the face.    It took us half an hour's hard labour, after that, before it was properly  up, and then we cleared the decks, and got out supper.  We put the kettle  on to boil, up in the nose of the boat, and went down to the stern and  pretended to take no notice of it, but set to work to get the other  things out.    That is the only way to get a kettle to boil up the river.  If it sees  that you are waiting for it and are anxious, it will never even sing.  You have to go away and begin your meal, as if you were not going to have  any tea at all.  You must not even look round at it.  Then you will soon  hear it sputtering away, mad to be made into tea.    It is a good plan, too, if you are in a great hurry, to talk very loudly  to each other about how you don't need any tea, and are not going to have  any.  You get near the kettle, so that it can overhear you, and then you  shout out, \"I don't want any tea; do you, George?\" to which George shouts  back, \"Oh, no, I don't like tea; we'll have lemonade instead--tea's so  indigestible.\"  Upon which the kettle boils over, and puts the stove out.    We adopted this harmless bit of trickery, and the result was that, by the  time everything else was ready, the tea was waiting.  Then we lit the  lantern, and squatted down to supper.    We wanted that supper.    For five-and-thirty minutes not a sound was heard throughout the length  and breadth of that boat, save the clank of cutlery and crockery, and the  steady grinding of four sets of molars.  At the end of five-and-thirty  minutes, Harris said, \"Ah!\" and took his left leg out from under him and  put his right one there instead.    Five minutes afterwards, George said, \"Ah!\" too, and threw his plate out  on the bank; and, three minutes later than that, Montmorency gave the  first sign of contentment he had exhibited since we had started, and  rolled over on his side, and spread his legs out; and then I said, \"Ah!\"  and bent my head back, and bumped it against one of the hoops, but I did  not mind it.  I did not even swear.    How good one feels when one is full--how satisfied with ourselves and  with the world!  People who have tried it, tell me that a clear  conscience makes you very happy and contented; but a full stomach does  the business quite as well, and is cheaper, and more easily obtained.  One feels so forgiving and generous after a substantial and well-digested  meal--so noble-minded, so kindly-hearted.    It is very strange, this domination of our intellect by our digestive  organs.  We cannot work, we cannot think, unless our stomach wills so.  It dictates to us our emotions, our passions.  After eggs and bacon, it  says, \"Work!\"  After beefsteak and porter, it says, \"Sleep!\"  After a cup  of tea (two spoonsful for each cup, and don't let it stand more than  three"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30802"],[0,"Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book the First (#18)"],[1," custom can prevail against an  express act of parliament; since the statute itself is a proof of a  time when such a custom did not exist[h].    [Footnote h: Co. Litt. 113 _b._]    2. IT must have been _continued_. Any interruption would cause a  temporary ceasing: the revival gives it a new beginning, which will be  within time of memory, and thereupon the custom will be void. But this  must be understood with regard to an interruption of the _right_; for  an interruption of the _possession_ only, for ten or twenty years,  will not destroy the custom[i]. As if I have a right of way by custom  over another's field, the custom is not destroyed, though I do not  pass over it for ten years; it only becomes more difficult to prove:  but if the _right_ be any how discontinued for a day, the custom is  quite at an end.    [Footnote i: Co. Litt. 114 _b._]    3. IT must have been _peaceable_, and acquiesced in; not subject to  contention and dispute[k]. For as customs owe their original to common  consent, their being immemorially disputed either at law or otherwise  is a proof that such consent was wanting.    [Footnote k: Co. Litt. 114.]    4. CUSTOMS must be _reasonable_[l]; or rather, taken negatively, they  must not be unreasonable. Which is not always, as sir Edward Coke  says[m], to be understood of every unlearned man's reason, but of  artificial and legal reason, warranted by authority of law. Upon which  account a custom may be good, though the particular reason of it  cannot be assigned; for it sufficeth, if no good legal reason can be  assigned against it. Thus a custom in a parish, that no man shall put  his beasts into the common till the third of october, would be good;  and yet it would be hard to shew the reason why that day in particular  is fixed upon, rather than the day before or after. But a custom that  no cattle shall be put in till the lord of the manor has first put in  his, is unreasonable, and therefore bad: for peradventure the lord  will never put in his; and then the tenants will lose all their  profits[n].    [Footnote l: Litt. Sec. 212.]    [Footnote m: 1 Inst. 62.]    [Footnote n: Co. Copyh. Sec. 33.]    5. CUSTOMS ought to be _certain_. A custom, that lands shall descend  to the most worthy of the owner's blood, is void; for how shall this  worth be determined? But a custom to descend to the next male of the  blood, exclusive of females, is certain, and therefore good[o]. A  custom, to pay two pence an acre in lieu of tythes, is good; but to  pay sometimes two pence and sometimes three pence, as the occupier of  the land pleases, is bad for it's uncertainty. Yet a custom, to pay a  year's improved value for a fine on a copyhold estate, is good: though  the value is a thing uncertain. For the value may at any time be  ascertained; and the maxim of law is, _id certum est, quod certum  reddi potest_.    [Footnote o: 1 Roll. Abr. 565.]    6. CUSTOMS, though established by consent, must be (when established)  _compulsory_; and not left to the option of every man, whether he will  use them or no. Therefore a custom, that all the inhabitants shall be  rated toward the maintenance of a bridge, will be good; but a custom,  that every man is to contribute thereto at his own pleasure, is idle  and absurd, and, indeed, no custom at all.    7. LASTLY, customs must be _consistent_ with each other: one custom  cannot be set up in opposition to another. For if both are really  customs, then both are of equal antiquity, and both established by  mutual consent: which to say of contradictory customs is absurd.  Therefore, if one man prescribes that by custom he has a right to have  windows looking into another's garden; the other cannot claim a right  by custom to stop up or obstruct those windows: for these two  contradictory customs cannot both be good, nor both stand together. He  ought rather to deny the existence of the former custom[p].    [Footnote p: 9 Rep. 58.]    NEXT, as to the allowance of special customs. Customs, in derogation  of the common law, must be construed strictly. Thus, by the custom of  gavelkind, an infant of fifteen years may by one species of  conveyance (called a deed of feoffment) convey away his lands in fee  simple, or for ever. Yet this custom does not impower him to use any  other conveyance, or even to lease them for seven years: for the  custom must be strictly pursued[q]. And, moreover, all special customs  must submit to the king's prerogative. Therefore, if the king  purchases lands of the nature of gavelkind, where all the sons inherit  equally; yet, upon the king's demise, his eldest son shall succeed to  those lands alone[r]. And thus much for the second part of the _leges  non scriptae_, or those particular customs which affect particular  persons or districts only.    [Footnote q: Co. Cop. Sec. 33.]    [Footnote r: Co. Litt. 15 _b._]    III. THE third branch of them are those peculiar laws, which by custom  are adopted and used only in certain peculiar courts and  jurisdictions. And by these I understand the civil and canon laws.    IT may seem a little improper at first view to rank these laws under  the head of _leges non scriptae_, or unwritten laws, seeing they are  set forth by authority in their pandects, their codes, and their  institutions; their councils, decrees, and decretals; and enforced by  an immense number of expositions, decisions, and treatises of the  learned in both branches of the law. But I do this, after the example  of sir Matthew Hale[s], because it is most plain, that it is not on  account of their being _written_ laws, that either the canon law, or  the civil law, have any obligation within this kingdom; neither do  their force and efficacy depend upon their own intrinsic authority;  which is the case of our written laws, or acts of parliament. They  bind not the subjects of England, because their materials were  collected from popes or emperors; were digested by Justinian, or  declared to be authentic by Gregory. These considerations give them no  authority here: for the legislature of England doth not, nor ever did,  recognize any foreign power, as superior or equal to it in this  kingdom; or as having the right to give law to any, the meanest, of  it's subjects. But all the strength that either the papal or imperial  laws have obtained in this realm, or indeed in any other kingdom in  Europe, is only because they have been admitted and received by  immemorial usage and custom in some particular cases, and some  particular courts; and then they form a branch of the _leges non  scriptae_, or customary law: or else, because they are in some other  cases introduced by consent of parliament, and then they owe their  validity to the _leges scriptae_, or statute law. This is expressly  declared in those remarkable words of the statute 25 Hen. VIII. c. 21.  addressed to the king's royal majesty.--\"This your grace's realm,  recognizing no superior under God but only your grace, hath been and  is free from subjection to any man's laws, but only to such as have  been devised, made, and ordained _within_ this realm for the wealth of  the same; or to such other, as by sufferance of your grace and your  progenitors, the people of this your realm, have taken at their free  liberty, by their own consent, to be used among them; and have bound  themselves by long use and custom to the observance of the same: not  as to the observance of the laws of any foreign prince, potentate, or  prelate; but as to the _customed_ and antient laws of this realm,  originally established as laws of the same, by the said sufferance,  consents, and custom; and none otherwise.\"    [Footnote s: Hist. C.L. c. 2.]    BY the civil law, absolutely taken, is generally understood the civil  or municipal law of the Roman empire, as comprized in the institutes,  the code, and the digest of the emperor Justinian, and the novel  constitutions of himself and some of his successors. Of which, as  there will frequently be occasion to cite them, by way of illustrating  our own laws, it may not be amiss to give a short and general account.    THE Roman law (founded first upon the regal constitutions of their  antient kings, next upon the twelve tables of the _decemviri_, then  upon the laws or statutes enacted by the senate or people, the edicts  of the praetor, and the _responsa prudentum_ or opinions of learned  lawyers, and lastly upon the imperial decrees, or constitutions of  successive emperors) had grown to so great a bulk, or as Livy  expresses it[t], \"_tam immensus aliarum super alias acervatarum legum  cumulus_,\" that they were computed to be many camels' load by an  author who preceded Justinian[u]. This was in part remedied by the  collections of three private lawyers, Gregorius, Hermogenes, and  Papirius; and then by the emperor Theodosius the younger, by whose  orders a code was compiled, _A.D._ 438, being a methodical collection  of all the imperial constitutions then in force: which Theodosian code  was the only book of civil law received as authentic in the western  part of Europe till many centuries after; and to this it is probable  that the Franks and Goths might frequently pay some regard, in framing  legal constitutions for their newly erected kingdoms. For Justinian  commanded only in the eastern remains of the empire; and it was under  his auspices, that the present body of civil law was compiled and  finished by Tribonian and other lawyers, about the year 533.    [Footnote t: _l._ 3. _c._ 34.]    [Footnote u: Taylor's elements of civil law. 17.]    THIS consists of, 1. The institutes, which contain the elements or  first principles of the Roman law, in four books. 2. The digests, or  pandects, in fifty books, containing the opinions and writings of  eminent lawyers, digested in a systematical method. 3. A new code, or  collection of imperial constitutions, the lapse of a whole century  having rendered the former code, of Theodosius, imperfect. 4. The"]]]
