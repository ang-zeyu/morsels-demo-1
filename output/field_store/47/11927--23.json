I hear from Hungary that the inhabitants of that country look at  the duns with a spinal stripe as the aboriginal stock, and so it is in  Norway. Dun-coloured ponies are not rare in the mountainous parts of  Devonshire, Wales, and Scotland, where the aboriginal breed would have the  best chance of being preserved. In South America in the time of Azara, when  the horse had been feral for about 250 years, 90 out of  100 horses were  \"bai-chatains,\" and the remaining ten were \"zains,\" that is brown; not more  than one in 2000 being black. In North America the feral horses show a  strong tendency to become roans of various shades; but in certain parts, as  I hear from Dr. Canfield, they are mostly duns and striped. (2/42. Azara  'Quadrupedes du Paraguay' tome 2 page 307. In North America Catlin (volume  2 page 57) describes the wild horses, believed to have descended from the  Spanish horses of Mexico, as of all colours, black, grey, roan, and roan  pied with sorrel. F. Michaux 'Travels in North America' English translation  page 235, describes two wild horses from Mexico as roan. In the Falkland  Islands, where the horse has been feral only between 60 and 70 years, I was  told that roans and iron-greys were the prevalent colours. These several  facts show that horses do not soon revert to any uniform colour.)    In the following chapters on the Pigeon we shall see that a blue bird is  occasionally produced by pure breeds of various colours and that when this  occurs certain black marks invariably appear on the wings and tail; so  again, when variously coloured breeds are crossed, blue birds with the same  black marks are frequently produced. We shall further see that these facts  are explained by, and afford strong evidence in favour of, the view that  all the breeds are descended from the rock-pigeon, or Columba livia, which  is thus coloured and marked. But the appearance of the stripes on the  various breeds of the horse, when of a dun colour, does not afford nearly  such good evidence of their descent from a single primitive stock as in the  case of the pigeon: because no horse certainly wild is known as a standard  of comparison; because the stripes when they appear are variable in  character; because there is far from sufficient evidence that the crossing  of distinct breeds produces stripes, and lastly, because all the species of  the genus Equus have the spinal stripe, and several species have shoulder  and leg stripes. Nevertheless the similarity in the most distinct breeds in  their general range of colour, in their dappling, and in the occasional  appearance, especially in duns, of leg-stripes and of double or triple  shoulder-stripes, taken together, indicate the probability of the descent  of all the existing races from a single, dun-coloured, more or less  striped, primitive stock, to which our horses occasionally revert.    THE ASS.    Four species of Asses, besides three zebras, have been described by  naturalists. There is now little doubt that our domesticated animal is  descended from the Equus taeniopus of Abyssinia. (2/43. Dr. Sclater in  'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1862 page 164. Dr. Hartmann says ('Annalen der Landw.'  b. 44 page 222) that this animal in its wild state is not always striped  across the legs.) The ass is sometimes advanced as an instance of an animal  domesticated, as we know by the Old Testament, from an ancient period,  which has varied only in a very slight degree. But this is by no means  strictly true; for in Syria alone there are four breeds (2/44. W.C. Martin  'History of the Horse' 1845 page 207.); first, a light and graceful animal,  with an agreeable gait, used by ladies; secondly, an Arab breed reserved  exclusively for the saddle; thirdly, a stouter animal used for ploughing  and various purposes; and lastly, the large Damascus breed, with a  peculiarly long body and ears. In the South of France also there are  several breeds, and one of extraordinary size, some individuals being as  tall as full-sized horses. Although the ass in England is by no means  uniform in appearance, distinct breeds have not been formed. This may  probably be accounted for by the animal being kept chiefly by poor persons,  who do not rear large numbers, nor carefully match and select the young.  For, as we shall see in a future chapter, the ass can with ease be greatly  improved in size and strength by careful selection, combined no doubt with  good food; and we may infer that all its other characters would be equally  amenable to selection. The small size of the ass in England and Northern  Europe is apparently due far more to want of care in breeding than to cold;  for in Western India, where the ass is used as a beast of burden by some of  the lower castes, it is not much larger than a Newfoundland dog, \"being  generally not more than from twenty to thirty inches high.\" (2/45. Col.  Sykes Cat. of Mammalia 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' July 12, 1831. Williamson  'Oriental Field Sports' volume 2 quoted by Martin page 206.)    The ass varies greatly in colour; and its legs, especially the fore-legs,  both in England and other countries--for instance, in China--are  occasionally barred more plainly than those of dun-coloured horses.  Thirteen or fourteen transverse stripes have been counted on both the fore  and hind legs. With the horse the occasional appearance of leg-stripes was  accounted for by reversion to a supposed parent-form, and in the case of  the ass we may confidently believe in this explanation, as E. taeniopus is  known to be barred, though only in a slight degree, and not quite  invariably. The stripes are believed to occur most frequently and to be  plainest on the legs of the domestic ass during early youth (2/46. Blyth in  'Charlesworth's Mag. of Nat. Hist.' vol 4 1840 page 83. I have also been  assured by a breeder that this is the case.), as likewise occurs with the  horse. The shoulder-stripe, which is so eminently characteristic of the  species, is nevertheless variable in breadth, length, and manner of  termination. I have measured one four times as broad as another, and some  more than twice as long as others. In one light-grey ass the shoulder-  stripe was only six inches in length, and as thin as a piece of string; and  in another animal of the same colour there was only a dusky shade  representing a stripe. I have heard of three white asses, not albinoes,  with no trace of shoulder or spinal stripes (2/47. One case is given by  Martin 'The Horse' page 205.); and I have seen nine other asses with no  shoulder-stripe, and some of them had no spinal stripe. Three of the nine  were light-greys, one a dark-grey, another grey passing into reddish-roan,  and the others were brown, two being tinted on parts of their bodies with a  reddish or bay shade. If therefore grey and reddish-brown asses had been  steadily selected and bred from, the shoulder stripe would probably have  been lost almost as generally and completely as in the case of the horse.    The shoulder stripe on the ass is sometimes double, and Mr. Blyth has seen  even three or four parallel stripes. (2/48. 'Journal As. Soc. of Bengal'  volume 28 1860 page 231. Martin on the Horse page 205.) I have observed in  ten cases shoulder-stripes abruptly truncated at the lower end, with the  anterior angle produced into a tapering point, precisely as in the above  dun Devonshire pony. I have seen three cases of the terminal portion  abruptly and angularly bent; and have seen and heard of four cases of a  distinct though slight forking of the stripe. In Syria, Dr. Hooker and his  party observed for me no less than five similar instances of the shoulder-  stripe plainly bifurcating over the fore leg. In the common mule it  likewise sometimes bifurcates. When I first noticed the forking and angular  bending of the shoulder-stripe, I had seen enough of the stripes in the  various equine species to feel convinced that even a character so  unimportant as this had a distinct meaning, and was thus led to attend to  the subject. I now find that in the E. burchellii and quagga, the stripe  which corresponds with the shoulder-stripe of the ass, as well as some of  the stripes on the neck, bifurcate, and that some of those near the  shoulder have their extremities bent angularly backwards. The bifurcation  and angular bending of the stripes on the shoulders apparently are  connected with the nearly upright stripes on the sides of the body and neck  changing their direction and becoming transverse on the legs. Finally, we  see that the presence of shoulder, leg, and spinal stripes in the horse,--  their occasional absence in the ass,--the occurrence of double and triple  shoulder-stripes in both animals, and the similar manner in which these  stripes terminate downwards,--are all cases of analogous variation in the  horse and ass. These cases are probably not due to similar conditions  acting on similar constitutions, but to a partial reversion in colour to  the common progenitor of the genus. We shall hereafter return to this  subject, and discuss it more fully.      CHAPTER 1.III.    PIGS--CATTLE--SHEEP--GOATS.    PIGS BELONG TO TWO DISTINCT TYPES, SUS SCROFA AND INDICUS.  TORFSCHWEIN.

You are hired to serve us for one  year. Now no more nonsense. Here, sheriff, tell these girls about  this.\"    \"Why, if you have taken the earnest money, ye are bound to go,\" said  the sheriff. \"So go along and make no more trouble, or I'll look after  ye.\" Now the women were in a pickle. If they persisted, of course they  would be set free when it was known they belonged to Queen Anne's  court; but they could never live down the disgrace of their prank.  Plainly there was nothing left for them but to abide by their  arrangement and go with Plunkett and Lionel. Everybody now set up an  indignant howl at their behaviour. Tristram could not help them. The  angry farmers pushed him aside, and Lady Harriet and Nancy were taken  by their arms by the two farmers, and walked back to where the wagon  waited.    \"Now then! no more nonsense, girls! Ye are hired to us and ye will  go,\" Plunkett declared, lifting the women into the wagon, while Lionel  got up beside them, and then amid the shouts of the crowd and the  laughter of the other girls, and the noise of the hurdy-gurdies and  the dancing and the calls of the people, Lady Harriet, Nancy, and  Lionel were driven off to the farm by Plunkett.      ACT II    \"Now, damsels, get to bed,\" Plunkett said to Martha and Nancy as he  opened the door of the farmhouse upon their arrival. \"Get to bed,  because ye must get up at dawn.\" The two giddy young women looked  about them. There were doors at the right and left of the big room  which they first entered, and they doubtless led to bedrooms. On the  table a lamp was burning and there were a couple of spinning wheels to  be seen. As they came in they noticed a bell hung on a pole just  outside the door. Not a bit like the palace of Queen Anne! and  altogether the lark didn't appear to have the advantages it first had.    \"O heaven! What shall we do?\" Martha said to Nancy. \"We must get out  of this soon, in some way.\"    \"Well, the main thing is to get to bed now,\" Nancy declared, and so  the girls turned to say good-night to the two farmers.    \"Good-night? Not so. There are your duties to be done first.\"    \"Our duties?\" Martha exclaimed, looking blank.    \"Oh, don't disturb them to-night,\" Lionel interrupted, speaking to his  brother. Lionel was more and more impressed with both of them,  especially with the beauty of Martha. \"They are very tired. Don't  disturb them to-night.\"    \"But you will spoil them to begin with,\" Plunkett insisted. \"And by  the way, what are your names?\" he asked.    \"Mine is Martha,\" Lady Harriet answered dolefully.    \"Mine is--Julia,\" Nancy said impatiently.    \"Ho, ho! Too grand to please me!--but, Julia, my dame of fashion,  pray, put my cloak away,\" Plunkett returned, handing it to her.    \"Upon my life! What impertinence!\" she cried, throwing the cloak upon  the floor. \"Put away your own cloak.\"    \"What--what?\" Plunkett shouted, enraged, and starting up.    \"Now, pray be lenient with them, brother. They are quite strange to  our ways, perhaps--and then they are very tired, you know. Probably  overworked by their last master. Leave matters to me. I'll put them  quite at their ease;\" whereupon Lionel took his hat and held it out to  Martha.    \"Martha--take it, if you please,\" Martha looked at him haughtily, and  turned her back on him. Poor Lionel was distracted and abashed.    \"Well, really, I don't--I don't know just what to do myself,\" he  declared, as his brother snorted with satisfaction at Lionel's  discomfiture.    \"Well,\" said Lionel, hesitating a moment; then he took his hat and  hung it up himself; then Plunkett picked up _his_ cloak and waited  upon _him_self.    \"A pretty kettle-of-fish, I should say,\" he muttered. \"Well, then, to  your spinning!\"    \"To our spinning?\" they cried in unison.    \"Yes, yes, to your spinning,\" Plunkett returned testily. \"Do you  expect to do nothing but entertain us with conversation? To your  spinning, I said.\" Then all at once the women burst out laughing.    \"Are ye good for nothing?\" Plunkett shouted, in a greater rage. \"Come,  we've had enough of this! You go and bring those spindles,\" and  Plunkett shouted this so loudly that the girls were downright  frightened at last.    \"Oh, do not scold us,\" Martha entreated, shrinking back.    \"No, no, brother, let us be gentle.\"    \"Stuff! Now, girls, you get at that spinning wheel as I tell you.\"    The two girls looked at each other. They no longer dared carry matters  with a high hand, and yet how could they spin? They knew no more how  to spin than did a couple of pussy-cats. After going up to the wheels  and looking at them in wonder, they exclaimed:    \"I can't.\"    \"What?\" yelled Plunkett.    \"We--we don't know how.\"    \"Well, upon my soul!\" Plunkett cried. \"Now you two sit down there as  quick as you can.\" They sat as if they were shot. Plunkett seemed very  much in earnest. \"Now turn those wheels!\"    \"They--they will _not_ turn,\" they cried, trying and making an awful  botch of it.    \"Twist the thread,\" Lionel instructed with much anxiety.    \"O Lord! It _won't_ twist, they _won't_ turn. Oh, good gracious! We  can't! we can't do it at all.\"    \"Now then, look at this,\" Plunkett cried, and he took Nancy from the  chair, and seated himself at the spinning wheel; and Lionel unseated  Martha--gently--and took her place, and then the fun began. \"Now  watch--and we will teach you something about this business.\"         This way set the wheel a-flying,       Set it whirring, set it flying.       Work the treadle with a will.       While an even thread you're plying,       Never let your wheel be still.         Come, you will not lose by trying,       I can see you have good will.    And while the girls joined in this gay spinning song, the men buzzed  an accompaniment of \"Brr, brr, brr,\" and the fun waxed fast and  furious, the men spinning faster and faster every moment, the girls  becoming more and more excited with watching and trying to  learn--because they now saw that there was nothing for them but to  begin business; and more than this, they began almost to like the  farmer chaps. After a moment, first one began to laugh, then another,  till suddenly they all dragged off into a merry \"ha, ha, ha!\"         Look! How the busy task he's plying,         Hercules is at the wheel;       Look, I too can set it flying,         Scold me if I do it ill    Nancy--or rather Julia--sang, as she took a turn at it. All had turned  to fun and frolic, and now even Lady Harriet--or Martha--could not  withstand the temptation to try her hand; so down she sat, and away  she went spinning, and singing with the best of them. Suddenly Nancy  upset her wheel, Plunkett gaily threatened her, and away she ran, with  Plunkett chasing after her. In a minute they had disappeared, and  Martha was left alone with Lionel.    \"Nancy--Julia--where are you? here! don't leave me--\" Martha cried.    \"Have no fear, gentle girl,\" Lionel said, detaining her. \"There is no  one who will hurt you.\" Martha regarded him with some anxiety for a  moment, then became reassured.    \"No--I will not be afraid,\" she thought. \"This stranger has a kind way  with him. True, they are strange in their ways--to me--but then I am  strange in my ways--to them.\"    \"Come! I'll promise never to be impatient with you nor to scold you if  you do not get things right. I am sure you will do your best,\" he  gently insisted, trying to put her at her ease. \"To tell the truth--I  am desperately in love with you, Martha.\"    \"Oh, good gracious--it is--so sudden----\" she gasped, looking about  for some chance of escape. \"Don't, sir! I assure you I am the worst  sort of servant. I have deceived you: as a matter of fact, I know  almost nothing of housework or farm work--I----\"    \"Well, at least, you know how to laugh and while the time away. Never  mind about the work--we shall get on; we'll let the work go. Only sing  for me--come, let us be gay.\"    \"Alas! I do not feel gay----\"    \"Then sing something that is not gay. Sing what you will--but sing,\"  he urged. He was more in love with her every moment, and not knowing  what else to do Martha sang--\"'Tis the Last Rose of Summer!\"    By the time the song was sung, Lionel had quite lost his head.    \"Martha, since the moment I first saw thee, I have loved thee madly.  Be my wife and I will be your willing slave--you may count on me to  do the spinning and everything else, if only you will be my wife. I'll  raise thee to my own station.\" This was really too much. Martha looked  at him in amazement.    \"Raise me--er--\" In spite of herself she had to laugh. Then, with a  feeling of tenderness growing in her heart, she felt sorry for him.    \"I am sorry to cause you pain, but really you don't know what you are  saying. I----\" And at this crisis Nancy and Plunkett came in, Plunkett  raising a great to-do because Nancy had been hiding successfully from  him, in the kitchen.    \"She hasn't been cooking,\" he explained; \"simply hiding--and I can't  abide idle ways--never could--now what is wrong with you two?\" he  asks, observing the restraint felt by Lionel and Martha; but before  any one could answer, midnight struck.    \"Twelve o'clock!\" all exclaimed.    \"All good angels watch over thee,\" Lionel said impulsively to Martha,  \"and make thee less scornful.\"    For a moment, Plunkett looked thoughtful, then turning to Nancy he  said manfully, while everybody seemed at pause since the stroke of  midnight.    \"Nancy, girl, you are not what I sought for--a good servant--but some  way, I feel as if--as if as a wife, I should find thee a good one. I  vow, I begin to love thee, for all of thy bothersome little ways.\"    \"Well, well, good-night, good-night, sirs,\" Nancy cried hastily and  somewhat disconcerted. To tell the truth, she had begun to think  kindly of Plunkett. Plunkett went thoughtfully to the outer door and  carefully locked it, then turned and"]]]
