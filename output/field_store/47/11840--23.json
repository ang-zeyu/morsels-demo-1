[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24717"],[0,"Danger! A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#18)"],[1," the proven facts. I  have thus ventured to allude to the distinction I have endeavored to  draw, not for the purpose of warping your minds, or in any degree  throwing an unfair prejudice around this case; but, in view of the  solemnity of the oaths you have taken, to do justice between the People  of the State of New York and the prisoner at the bar, and to see upon  what testimony you are asked to consign an innocent, but foolish young  man, for a long term of years to the state prison.    I find in the book before me, gentlemen, to my surprise--and when it  will be handed to you I think you will agree with me and share my  astonishment--that on the first day of October last Mr. Lynch has sworn  that _his_ diamond ear-rings were stolen. I find that from the first day  of October until the 8th day of December--a long lapse of nearly two  months--no steps are taken by those who are alleged to have sustained  the loss, and nothing is done until the latter date. I will show you why  this demand is made upon the Executive--a novel proceeding altogether,  without any indictment being preferred in this office--and a journey is  made to Pittsburgh, not by the officers alone, but as we have it on the  sworn testimony of the woman in this case, that she, without her  protector, without the man Bethune (who is with her now as her husband,  and who professed to be so then), proceeded alone to Pittsburgh, and is  subsequently followed by Mr. Bethune. That is the first era, the first  of October. We next find Mrs. Bethune detailing to you that these  ear-rings were taken (how she does not know), but only what she was told  by a little girl whom we have not seen. So her story runs. It is pretty  for the present; but I hope to destroy the poetry of it very shortly.  That this man stole, not on the first of October, but on the 19th of  October, and subsequently corrected to-day, by the lady of treacherous  memory, to the date of the 20th. At all events, it is perfectly clear,  now, according to her last amended allegation, that on the 20th of  October she claims a larceny to have been committed. But a Mr. Lynch is  supposed to be the owner of the earrings, and not Mrs. Bethune! It  transpires that she had merely borrowed them for a while, as she tells  you; and then on the 20th of October she learns the loss. Why,  gentlemen, did not Mrs. Bethune tell you, that nearly a month after that  and in November, she had met this man on the street with Miss Kate  Fisher? That they had business transactions, that she knew him--the  theatrical manager--that he was to open a theatre--that money was  supplied by her for that express purpose? Did not she know within one  month after this transaction the same state of facts which she deposes  to-day? Why not have had the prisoner arrested on the street then?    No, gentlemen, I will give you my theory of this case; I will render to  you what this man has told me, and if it be not a common-sense view of  it, no logic--no metaphysics--then discard every word uttered and  condemn this man. The pawnbroker throws additional light upon this  transaction, and, gentlemen, if you will refer to the date in his book  of the 17th of November (a month after his alleged larceny), you will  find an important fact which I beseech you to hold, pointedly, in your  own estimation. You will remember that she contradicts herself, and  stated that she had had no transactions with Hemmings after the alleged  larceny. One of the gentlemen on the jury put the very pertinent  question (seeing the force of this), whether she had transactions with  the prisoner after this alleged stealing. You will remember for  yourselves, gentlemen, and I point to it without fear of contradiction,  that at first she stated the ear-rings were taken on the 19th of  October, but, seeing, with a woman's keen perception, the fatal error  she had made in stating that admission, seeing that you, as common-sense  men, would have at once said: \"Why not have had him arrested then?\" she  quickly drew back, like a snail when the crashing foot is coming upon  it, and drew the horns within the shell which covered it; and,  yesterday, corrected the date. She changed the date and put it back from  November to October. I congratulate her upon the change! For all the  trickery and malice which were embodied in it, only enured to the  prisoner's benefit. It was here sworn, to-day, that on the 17th of  November last, her watch and chain (her watch and chain, gentlemen) not  Mr. Lynch's, but Eliza Bethune's, was pledged in New York at Mr.  Barnard's, the identical pawnbroker with whom the earrings were pledged.  By whom? By Mrs. Bethune? Oh no! gentlemen! but by Hemmings, the man  here. If he accomplished this ubiquitous feat, like the ghost in Hamlet,  to be in two places at one time, he is one of the most wonderful  performers of the modern day. (Laughter.) He could not be in Barnard's  pawn-shop in New York pledging Mrs. Bethune's watch on the 17th of  November, a month after the larceny, and be, as she would have you  believe, with Kate Fisher performing in Pittsburgh. Why, look at that  contradiction! I invoke that book (pointing to the pawnbroker's record),  as in other temples I appeal to the Holy one, for my protection. In your  hands I place it. Upon your altar do I offer it up; and I believe that  you will grant my prayers, that this will be taken as the strongest  evidence of the prisoner's innocence. Records cannot lie here. The  testimony is that this man had subsequent transactions with Mrs.  Bethune, supporting, beyond a doubt, my theory that she gave him the  ear-rings to pledge. Now let us see. She tells you (and there are other  circumstances of greater peculiarity still around this case)--she tells  you that she became acquainted with this man some twelve years since;  and although I was prohibited (perhaps properly) by the court from  putting other questions, I think I am not saying too much, when I urge  that I did elicit from that lady sufficient to justify any one of you in  forming an opinion as to the immoral terms of intimacy subsisting  between Hemmings and that lady who was upon the witness stand. I can  only say that I think there is not one of you composing that jury who  would be pleased to have a wife of yours detailing circumstances in any  way similar. I think that not only jealousy, but indignation of the  strongest character, would be aroused in each of you, and you would  unhesitatingly brand her as an adulteress.    Now, gentlemen, we find they have known each other for twelve years, and  what besides? Why, she takes him into her house; she gives him an  apartment there. Nay, she does more, according to her confession. She  saw that he was poor and had no clothes (to use her own expression.) I  do not think, gentlemen, that she exactly meant that, when she said it,  in its literal signification (laughter), but she certainly said that he  had no clothes, and that she clothed him and she \"took him in\" (loud  laughter). She went to A. T. Stewart's (kind-hearted charitable woman!)  and saw Mr. Griswold. She interceded with Griswold and got Hemmings a  situation in A. T. Stewart's. What relation was Hemmings to her, at this  time, to induce her to take this kind and charitable interest in him? I,  gentlemen, am not so charitable as she professed to be; neither do I  think you will be, gentlemen. I apprehend that the motive which actuated  the taking in, the clothing and the obtaining a situation at Stewart's,  was another motive altogether (immoderate laughter). What it was, I will  leave you to conjecture. Look a little further. Hemmings is no relation  to her, and yet we find her taking him to Saratoga! In what capacity?  Why, she tells you, to attend Bethune's horses at Saratoga (laughter).  Yes, gentlemen, and this hostler, this stable boy, in the same breath,  is introduced by this lady as what--a lover! oh, no, she dare not do  that--but as a relation--a blood relation! She makes him, for that  occasion, her brother at Saratoga! Well, so far, there is no  impropriety, you will say; but coupled with several other facts--coupled  with the act that that book (the pawnbrokers book) teems with the name  of Bethune, as pledging jewelry pledged by Hemmings, and belonging to  the lady, you must see the intimacy which unquestionably existed. She  admitted to you that time and again he had pledged what? Why, he had  pledged her studs, her brooches and God knows what all! What did she?  Why not have him arrested then? Oh! well, she says, \"he cried--my  brother cried.\" (Loud laughter.) \"I did not like to hurt my brother.\"  She forgave him, and I will tell you why.    You know the quotation that \"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\"  Mr. Hemmings, who is a fine, healthy, fashionable, well-rounded and  vigorous, and, some women might say, good-looking young man, had  migrated from the city of New York to spend some time in Pittsburgh, and  he was in dangerous proximity to a very enticing and attractive actress,  Miss Kate Fisher. (Loud laughter).    Gentlemen, in the play of Othello, which many of you have doubtless seen  and read, you will find the episode of the handkerchief, which you will  remember belonged to Desdemona; being the gift of her husband, the Moor.  You remember Iago (in that case it was a man, however,) instigated his  wife to purloin the handkerchief, and to deposit it in the chamber of  Cassio, if I am correct; and Cassio, unfortunately, not seeing the  little trap that was prepared for him, wound that spotted piece of  cambric around his knee to stop the blood flowing from the wound he had  received in a drunken brawl. Upon Othello seeing that, he states, that  not being jealous, he \"was perplexed in the extreme,\" and the sequel was  the murder about which we have so often heard. I say, gentlemen, if ever  there was the play of Othello reduced to private life and reacted, it is  here.

All around below the steps is a company of  friends who have been invited by her father and mother to attend them on  this important occasion. The picture is full of life and action, and is  gorgeous in its coloring. Several of the figures are said to be  portraits, one being that of Titian himself.    Among his female portraits, that of Caterina Cornaro, Queen of Cyprus, is  celebrated; also one called \"Flora;\" both of these are in the Uffizi  Gallery, in Florence, while near by, in the Pitti, is \"La Bella,\" or the  beautiful lady of Titian. He also made many portraits of his daughter  Lavinia, who was very beautiful; sometimes he represented her as a fruit  or flower-girl, again as Herodias and in various characters (Fig. 46). One  of the finest of these is at Berlin, where she is in a very rich dress,  and holds up a plate of fruit; it is one of his best works.    Titian's fame extended throughout Italy, and even all over Europe, and the  Duke of Ferrara invited him to his court. The artist went, and there  painted two very famous mythological pictures, besides portraits and other  works. One of these important subjects was \"Bacchus and Ariadne,\" and it  is now in the National Gallery, London; the second was a Venus, surrounded  by more than sixty children and cupids; some are climbing trees, others  shoot arrows in the air, while still others twine their arms around each  other; this is now in Madrid.    While at Ferrara the Pope, Leo X., asked Titian to go to Rome; but he  longed for his home--he wished for his yearly visit to Cadore, and he  declined the honorable invitation, and returned to Venice. In 1530  Titian's wife died, leaving him with two sons, Pomponio and Orazio, and  his daughter, Lavinia. In this same sad year the Emperor Charles V. and  Pope Clement VII. met at Bologna. All the most brilliant men of Germany  and Italy were also there, and Titian was summoned to paint portraits of  the two great heads of Church and State, and of many of the notable men  among their followers.    [Illustration: FIG. 46.--PORTRAIT OF LAVINIA. _By Titian._]    When the painter returned to Venice he was loaded with honors and riches.  He bought a new house at Berigrande, opposite the island of Murano; it  commanded fine views and its garden was beautiful. The landscapes of his  pictures soon grew better than they had been, and no wonder, when he could  always see the Friuli Alps in the distance with their snow-capped peaks  rising to the clouds; nearer him was the Murano, like another city with  its towers and domes, and then the canals, which at night were gay with  lighted gondolas bearing fair ladies hither and thither. Here Titian  entertained many people, and some of them were exalted in station. The  house was called \"Casa Grande,\" and on one occasion, when a cardinal and  others invited themselves to dine with him, Titian flung a purse to his  steward, saying, \"Now prepare a feast, since all the world dines with me.\"    While living at \"Casa Grande,\" the artist saw the most glorious years of  his life. It seemed that every person of note in all Europe, both men and  women, desired their portraits at his hand. One only, Cosmo I., Grand Duke  of Florence, refused to sit to him. If these pictures could be collected  together, most of the famous persons of his time would be represented in  them.    After he was sixty years old Titian made a second journey to Ferrara,  Urbino, and Bologna. This time he painted a portrait of Charles V., with a  favorite dog by his side. After this, in 1545, at an invitation from Pope  Paul III., the great master went to Rome; while there he painted many  wonderful pictures--among them, one of the pope with his two grandsons was  very remarkable; it is now in the Museum of Naples. He left Rome when he  was sixty-nine years old.    In 1548 Charles V. summoned Titian to Augsburg, and while there made him a  count, and gave him a yearly pension of two hundred gold ducats. The  emperor was very fond of Titian, and spent a good deal of time with him.  On one occasion the painter dropped his brush; the emperor picked it up,  and returned it to him. The etiquette of courts forbade any one to receive  such a service from the sovereign, and Titian was much embarrassed, when  Charles said, \"Titian is worthy to be served by Caesar,\" this being one of  the great ruler's titles. Charles continued his favors to Titian through  life, and when he resigned his crown, and retired to the monastery of  Yuste, he took nine pictures by this master into his solitude. One of  these, a portrait of the Empress Isabella, was so hung that the emperor  gazed upon it when dying; this is now in the museum at Madrid, where are  also many fine works by Titian, for Philip II. was his patron as his  father had been.    When eighty-five years old he finished his wonderful picture of the  \"Martyrdom of St. Lawrence\" for the Church of the Jesuits in Venice, and  his old age was one of strength and mental clearness. Though he had seen  great prosperity and received many honors, he had not escaped sorrow.  After the death of his wife, his sister Orsa, who was very dear to him,  had kept his house; she too sickened and died; his son Pomponio was a  worthless fellow, and caused him much grief; Lavinia had married, and the  old man was left with Orazio alone, who was a dutiful son. He also was an  artist, but painted so frequently on the same canvas with his father that  his works cannot be spoken of separately.    At length Titian's work began to show his years, and some one told him  that his \"Annunciation\" did not resemble his usual pictures. He was very  angry, and, seizing a pencil, wrote upon it, \"_Tizianus fecit  fecit_\"--meaning to say by this, \"Truly, Titian did this!\" When he was  ninety-six years old he was visited by Henry III. of France, attended by a  train of princes and nobles. The aged painter appeared with such grace and  dignity as to excite the admiration of all, and when the king asked the  price of some pictures, Titian presented them to him as one sovereign  might make a gift to another who was his equal, and no more.    In 1576 the plague broke out in Venice, and both Titian and Orazio fell  victims to it. Naturally the man of ninety-eight years could not recover,  and, though Orazio was borne off to the hospital and cared for as well as  possible, he also died. After Titian was left alone robbers entered his  house while he still lived, and carried away jewels, money, and pictures.  He died August 27th, and all Venice mourned for him.    There was a law that no person who died of the plague in Venice should be  buried within the city; but Titian was so much honored and beloved that  exception was made, and he was buried in the Church of Santa Maria  Gloriosa de Frari; or as it is usually called, \"the Frari.\" He had painted  a great picture of the Assumption for this church, which has since been  removed to the Academy of Venice; but another work of his, called the  Pesaro altar-piece, still remains near his grave. His burial-place is  marked by a simple tablet, inscribed thus: \"Here lies the great Tiziano di  Vecelli, rival of Zeuxis and Apelles.\"    A little more than two centuries after his death the citizens of Venice  determined to erect a monument to Titian, and Canova made a design for it;  but political troubles interfered, and prevented the execution of the  plan. In 1852 the Emperor of Austria, Ferdinand I., placed a costly  monument near his grave; it consists of a Corinthian canopy beneath which  is a sitting statue of the painter, while several other allegorical  figures are added to increase its magnificence. This monument was  dedicated with imposing ceremonies, and it is curious to note that not far  away from it the sculptor Canova is buried, and his own monument is made  from the design which he made for that of Titian.    Some writers consider the \"Entombment of Christ,\" in the Manfrini Palace,  as the greatest work of Titian. At all events, it is the best existing  representation of this subject, and is a picture which has had a great  effect upon art; its chief feature is the general expression of sorrow  which pervades the whole work.    Titian gave a new importance to landscape-painting by making backgrounds  to his pictures from natural scenery, and that not as if it was merely for  the sake of a background, but in a manner which showed his love for  Nature, and, in fact, he often rendered it with poetical significance.    The works of Titian are very seldom sold. One subject which he oftentimes  repeated was that of \"Danae\" with the shower of gold falling about her;  one of these was purchased by the Emperor of Russia for six hundred  thousand francs. One of the most important of his religious pictures was  that of \"St. Peter Martyr;\" this was burned in the Church of SS. Giovanni  e Paolo in Venice in 1868. An excellent copy of it had been for a long  time in the Museum of Florence, and this was presented to the Venetians in  order to repair their loss as far as possible. Victor Amadeus of Sardinia  presented nine pictures by Titian to the Duke of Marlborough, and these  were all destroyed in 1861 when the chateau of Blenheim was burned. Kugler  says: \"In the multifariousness of his powers Titian takes precedence of  all other painters of his school; indeed, there is scarcely a line of art  which in his long and very active life he did not enrich.\" His last work  was not quite completed by himself, and is now in the Academy of Venice.  It is a Pieta, and although the hand of ninety-eight years guided the  brush uncertainly, yet it has the wonderful light this master threw around  his figures, and the whole is conceived with his accustomed animation.    The pupils and followers of Titian were too numerous to be spoken of one  by one, and none of them were so great as to require their mention in  detail here; yet they"]]]
