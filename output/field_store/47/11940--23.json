Tor. _Hysitia_, from _Isicia_.      This term is derived from _insicium_, from _salsicium_,      from _salsum insicium_, cut salt meat; old French      _salcisse_, _saulcisse_, modern French _saucisse_,      meaning sausage. This is a confirmation of the meaning      of the word _salsum_--meaning primarily salt meat, bacon      in particular. It has survived in modern French      terminology in _sales_ more specially _petits      sales_--small rashers of bacon. _Salsum_ has caused much      confusion in some later formulae. Cf. notes to Nos. 148,      150, 152.        [2] V. fish forcemeats, fish balls, fish cakes and      similar preparations.        [3] Scallops and oysters wanting in List. and G.-V.

SHAPE THE FORCEMEAT INTO NEAT CROQUETTES [2]  AND COOK THEM IN LIQUAMEN [3].    THEY ARE DISPLAYED NICELY ON A LARGE DISH.        V. This formula plainly calls for fish balls braised or      stewed in broth. Ordinarily we would boil the fish first      and then separate the meat from the bones, shred or chop      it fine, bind with cream sauce, flour and eggs; some add      potatoes as a binder, and fry.        [1] G.-V. _lolligine_; Tor. _loligine_, which is      correctly spelled.        [2] Tac. and Tor. _in pulmento tundes_. G.-V. _fulmento_      which is wrong. _Pulmentum_, abbreviated for      _pulpamentum_, from _pulpa_. It means a fleshy piece of      fish or meat, a tid-bit.        [3] The original says _in liquamine fricatur_--fry in      l., which is impossible in the sense of the word,      frying. Either \"frying\" here stands for cooking,      stewing, braising, poaching, or else the so mysterious      _liquamen_ must here mean deep fat. Most likely these      fish forcemeat balls were fried in olive oil. Cf. {Rx}      No. 46.      [43] LOBSTER OR CRABMEAT CROQUETTES     _ISICIA DE SCILLIS VEL DE CAMMARIS AMPLIS_ [1]    THE SHELLS OF THE LOBSTERS OR CRABS [which are cooked] ARE BROKEN, THE  MEAT EXTRACTED FROM THE HEAD AND POUNDED IN THE MORTAR WITH PEPPER AND  THE BEST KIND OF BROTH. THIS PULP [is shaped into neat little cakes  which are fried] AND SERVED UP NICELY [2].        [1] _Scilla_ or _squilla_, squill, sea-onion, also a      crab, _cammarus amplus_, large lobster, langouste, spiny      lobster.        [2] The original omits the mode of cooking the fish. A      case where it is taken for granted that the shellfish is      boiled in water alive. The broth (_liquamen_) is a thick      fish sauce in this case, serving as a binder for the      meat, conforming to present methods.        Dann. Fill this into sausage casing. There is no      authority for this.      [44] LIVER KROMESKIS     _OMENTATA_ [1]    OMENTATA ARE MADE IN THIS MANNER: [lightly] FRY PORK LIVER, REMOVE  SKIN AND SINEWS FIRST [2].

Hence \"omen.\" Minced meats wrapped in caul and      fried are kromeskis in kitchen terminology.

We talked, and made futile plans. I went to sleep, but  awakened after a few hours. Impending disaster lay heavily on me. But  there was nothing abnormal nor unusual in that!    Snap was asleep. I was restless, but I did not have the heart to  awaken him. He needed what little repose he could get. I dressed, left  our cubby and wandered out into the corridor of the main building.    It was cold in the corridor, and gloomy with the weak blue light. An  interior watchman passed me.    \"All as usual, Haljan.\"    \"Nothing in sight?\"    \"No. They're looking.\"    I went through the connecting corridor to the adjacent building. In  the instrument-room several of the men were gathered, scanning the  vault overhead.    \"Nothing, Haljan.\"    I stayed with them awhile, then wandered away. The outside man met me  near the admission lock-chambers of the main building. The duty-man  here sat at his controls, raising the air-pressure in the locks  through which the outside watchman was coming. The relief sat here in  his bloated suit, with his helmet on his knees. It was Wilks.    \"Nothing yet, Haljan. I'm going up to the peak of the crater to see if  anything is in sight. I wish that damnable brigand ship would come and  get it over with.\"    Instinctively we all spoke in half whispers, the tenseness bearing in  on us.    The outside man came out of his helmet. He was white and grim, but he  grinned at Wilks.    \"All is usual.\" He tried the familiar jest at Wilks, but his voice was  flat: \"Don't let the Earthlight get you!\"    Wilks went out through the portes--a process of no more than a minute.  I wandered away again through the corridors.           *       *       *       *       *    I suppose it was half an hour later that I chanced to be gazing  through a corridor window. The lights along the rocky cliff-edge were  tiny blue spots. The head of the stairway leading down to the abyss of  the crater floor was visible. The bloated figure of Wilks was just  coming up. I watched him for a moment making his rounds. He did not  stop to inspect the lights. That was routine; I thought it queer that  he passed them.    Another minute passed. The figure of Wilks went with slow bounds over  toward the back of the ledge where the glassite shelter housed the  treasure. It was all dark off there. Wilks went into the gloom, but  before I lost sight of him he came back. As though he had changed his  mind he headed for the foot of the staircase which led up the  cliff-face to where, at the peak of the little crater, five hundred  feet above us, the narrow observatory platform was perched. He climbed  with easy bounds, the light on his helmet bobbing in the gloom.    I stood watching. I could not tell why there seemed to be something  queer about Wilks' actions. But I was struck with it, nevertheless. I  watched him disappear over the peak of the summit.    Another minute went by. Wilks did not reappear. I thought I could make  out his light on the platform up there. Then abruptly a tiny white  beam was waving from the observatory platform! It flashed once or  twice, then was extinguished. And now I saw Wilks plainly, standing in  the Earthlight, gazing down.    Queer actions! Had the Earthlight touched him? Or was that a local  signal-call which he had sent out? Why should Wilks be signalling?  What was he doing with a hand-helio? Our watchmen, I knew, had no  reason to carry one.    And to whom could Wilks be signalling across this Lunar desolation?  The answer stabbed at me: to Miko's band!    I waited another moment. No further light. Wilks was still up there!           *       *       *       *       *    I went back to the lock entrance. Spare suits and helmets were here  beside the keeper. He gazed at me inquiringly.    \"I'm going out, Franck, just for a minute.\" It struck me that perhaps  I was a meddlesome fool. Wilks, of all Grantline's men, was, I knew,  most in his commander's trust. The signal could have been some part of  this night's ordinary routine, for all I knew.    I was hastily donning an Erentz suit. I added, \"Let me out. I just got  the idea Wilks is acting queerly.\" I laughed. \"Maybe the Earthlight  has touched him.\"    With my helmet on I went through the locks. Once outside, with the  outer panel closed behind me, I dropped the weights from my belt and  shoes and extinguished my helmet-light.    Wilks was still up there. Apparently he had not moved. I bounded off  across the ledge to the foot of the ascending stairs. Did Wilks see me  coming? I could not tell. As I approached the stairs the platform was  cut off from my line of vision.    I mounted with bounding leaps. In my flexible gloved hand I carried my  only weapon, a small bullet projector with oxygen firing caps for use  in this outside near-vacuum. The leaden bullet with its slight mass  would nevertheless pierce a man at the distance of twenty feet.    I held the weapon behind me. I would talk to Wilks first.    I went slowly up the last hundred feet. Was Wilks still up there? The  summit was bathed in Earthlight. The little metal observatory platform  came into view above my head.    Wilks was not there. Then I saw him standing on the rocks nearby,  motionless. But in a moment he saw me coming.    I waved my left arm with a gesture of greeting. It seemed to me that  he started, made as though to leap away, then changed his mind and  waited for me.    I sailed from the head of the staircase with a twenty-foot leap and  landed lightly beside him. I gripped his arm for audiphone contact.    \"Wilks!\"    Through the visors his face was visible. I saw him, and he saw me. And  I heard his voice.    \"You, Haljan! How nice!\"    It was not Wilks, but the brigand Coniston!      CHAPTER XXIV    _Imprisoned!_    The duty-man at the exit locks of the main building stood at his  window and watched me curiously. He saw me go up the spider-stairs. He  could see the figure he thought was Wilks, standing at the top. He saw  me join Wilks, saw us locked together in combat.    For an instant the duty-man stood amazed. There were two fantastic,  misshapen figures swaying in the Earthlight five hundred feet above  the camp, fighting desperately at the very brink. They were small,  dwarfed by distance, alternately dim and bright as they swayed in and  out of the shadows. Soon the duty-man could not tell one from the  other. Haljan and Wilks--fighting to the death!    The duty-man recovered himself and sprang into action. An interior  siren-call was on the instrument panel near him. He rang it, alarming  the camp.    The men came rushing to him, Grantline among them.    \"What's this? Good God, Franck!\"    They saw the silent, deadly combat up there on the cliff. The two  figures had fallen together from the observatory platform, dropped  twenty feet to a lower landing on the stairs. They lay as though  stunned for a moment, then fought on.    Grantline stood stricken with amazement. \"That's Wilks!\"    \"And Haljan,\" the duty-man gasped. \"Went out--something wrong with  Wilks--acting strangely--\"    The interior of the camp was in a turmoil. The men awakened from  sleep, ran out into the corridors, shouted questions.    \"An attack?\"    \"Is it an attack?\"    \"The brigands?\"           *       *       *       *       *    But it was Wilks and Haljan in a fight out there on the cliff. The men  crowded at the bulls'-eye windows.    And over all the confusion the alarm siren, with no one thinking to  shut it off, was screaming with its electrical voice.    Grantline, stricken for that moment of inactivity, stood gazing. One  of the figures broke away from the other, bounded up to the summit  from the stair-platform to which they had fallen. The other followed.  They locked together, swaying at the brink. For an instant it seemed  to Grantline that they would go over; then they surged back,  momentarily out of sight.    Grantline found his wits. \"Stop them! I'll go out to stop them! What  fools!\"    He was hastily donning one of the Erentz suits which stood at the lock  entrance. \"Shut off that siren, Franck!\"    Within a minute Grantline was ready. The duty-man called from the  window:    \"Still at it! By the infernal, such fools! They'll kill themselves!\"    The figures had swayed back into view, then out of sight again.    \"Franck, let me out.\"    Grantline was ready. He stood, helmet in hand.    \"I'll go with you, Commander.\"    But the volunteer was not equipped. Grantline would not wait.    \"I'm going at once. Hurry, Franck.\"    The duty-man turned to his panel. The volunteer shoved a weapon at  Grantline. \"Here, take this.\"    Grantline jammed on his helmet.           *       *       *       *       *    He moved the few steps into the small air-chamber which was the first  of the three pressure locks. Its interior door-panel swung open for  him. But the door did not close after him!    Cursing the duty-man's slowness, he waited a few seconds. Then he  turned to the corridor. The duty-man came running.    Grantline took off his helmet. \"What in hell--\"    \"Broken! Dead!\"    \"What!\"    \"Smashed from outside,\" gasped the duty-man. \"Look there--my tubes--\"    The control-tubes of the portes had flashed into a close-circuit and  burned out. The admission portes would not open!    \"And the pressure controls smashed! Broken from outside--!\"    There was no way now of getting out through these pressure-locks. The  doors, the entire pressure-lock system, was dead. Had it been tampered  with from outside?    As though to answer Grantline's amazed question there came a chorus of  shouts from the men at the corridor windows.    \"Commander! By God--look!\"    A figure was outside, close to the building! Clothed in suit and  helmet, it stood, bloated and gigantic. It had evidently been lurking  at the porte-entrance, had ripped out the wires there.    It moved past the windows, saw the staring faces of the men, and"]]]
