We owe to HERSCHEL the first trustworthy account of the stars visible  to the naked eye, and since the date of his labors (about 1800) we have  similar views published by ARGELANDER (1839), HEIS (1848), ARGELANDER  and SCHOeNFELD (1857), GOULD (1860 and 1872), and HOUZEAU (1875). Thus  his labors have been well followed up.    In the prosecution of this work HERSCHEL found stars whose light was  progressively diminishing, others which regularly increased, one star  whose light periodically varies (_[alpha] Herculis_), and at least  one star (55 _Herculis_) which has utterly disappeared. On October 10,  1781, and April 11, 1782, he observed this latter star, but in May,  1791, it had totally vanished. There was no trace remaining.    The discovery of the variability of _[alpha] Herculis_ was a more  important one than would at first sight appear. Up to that time the only  variable stars known were seven in number. Their periods were four  hundred and ninety-four, four hundred and four, three hundred and  thirty-four, seven, six, five, and three days. These periods seemed to  fall into two groups, one of from three hundred to five hundred days,  the other comparatively much shorter, of three to seven days.  _[alpha] Herculis_ came to occupy the middle place between these groups,  its period being about sixty days.    The cause of these strange and regular variations of brightness was  supposed by HERSCHEL to be the rotation of the star bodily on an axis,  by which revolution different parts of its surface, of different  brilliancy, were successively and periodically presented to us. This  explanation it might have been difficult to receive, when the periods of  the known variables were so markedly various in length. His own  discovery came to bridge over the interval, and quite confirmed him in  his belief. He returned to the subject of the revolution of stars about  their axes again and again, and connected it with the revolution of  satellites.    He found that the satellites of _Jupiter_ and one of _Saturn's_  periodically changed in brightness, and by quite simple means showed  that their periods of rotation were at least approximately the same as  their periods of revolution about their primaries. In this case, as in  every other, he considered a discovery in each and every one of its  possible bearings. There are no instances where he has singularly  overlooked the consequences of his observations.                          _Researches on Double Stars._    The double stars were the subject of HERSCHEL'S earliest and of his  latest papers. In 1782 he published his \"_Catalogue of Double Stars_,\"  and his last published memoir (1822) was on the same subject.    The question of determining the parallax of stars first brought HERSCHEL  to the discovery of double stars. If two stars, A and B, appear very  close together, and if, in reality, the star B is very many times more  distant from the earth than A, although seen along the same line of  sight, then the revolution of the earth in its orbit will produce  changes in the relative situation of A and B, and, in fact, B will  describe a small orbit about A, due to this revolution. This idea had  been proposed by GALILEO, and measures on this plan had been made by  LONG, with negative results. But HERSCHEL, in reviewing their work,  declares that the stars chosen by LONG were not suitable to the purpose.  It is necessary, among other things, to the success of this method, that  it should be certain that the star B is really very much more distant  than the star A. The only general test of the distance of stars is their  brilliancy, and HERSCHEL decided to use only stars for this research  which had two components very greatly different in brightness. A must be  very bright (and presumably near to us), and B must be very close to A,  and very faint (and thus, presumably, very distant).    It was in the search for such pairs of stars that the _Catalogue of  Double Stars_ (1782) was formed. HERSCHEL'S first idea of a double star  made such pairs as he found, to consist of two stars _accidentally_ near  to each other. A was near to us, and appeared projected in a certain  place on the celestial sphere. B was many times more distant, but, by  chance, was seen along the same line, and made with A an _optical_  double. If the two stars were at the same distance from the earth, if  they made part of the same physical system, if one revolved around the  other, then this method of gaining a knowledge of their distance failed.  Even in his first memoir on the subject, a surmise that this latter  state might occur in some cases, was expressed by HERSCHEL. The notes on  some of the pairs declare that a motion of one of them was suspected.  But this motion might be truly orbital--of one star about the other as  a centre--or it might simply be that one star was moving by its own  _proper_ motion, and leaving the other behind. It was best to wait and  see. The first Catalogue of Double Stars contained two hundred and three  instances of such associations. These were observed from time to time,  and new pairs discovered. The paper of MICHELL, \"An Inquiry into the  probable Parallax and Magnitude of the Fixed Stars, from the Quantity of  Light which they Afford, and the Particular Circumstances of their  Situation\" (1767), was read and pondered. By 1802 HERSCHEL had become  certain that there existed in the heavens real pairs of stars, both at  the same distance from the earth, which were physically connected with  each other. The arguments of MICHELL have been applied by BESSEL to the  case of one of HERSCHEL'S double stars, in much the same order in which  the argument ran in HERSCHEL'S own mind, as follows:    The star _Castor_ (_[alpha] Geminorum_) is a double star, where A is of  the second, and B of the fourth, magnitude. To the naked eye these two  appear as one star. With a telescope this is seen to be two stars, some  5\" apart. In the whole sky there are not above fifty such stars  as the brighter of the two, and about four hundred of the brilliancy of  B. These fifty and four hundred stars are scattered over the vault of  heaven, almost at random. No law has yet been traced by which we can say  that here or here there shall be a bright star like A, or a fainter one  like B. In general the distribution appears to be fortuitous. How then  can we account for one of the four hundred stars like B placed so close  to one of the fifty like A?    The chances are over four hundred thousand to one that the association  in position is not accidental. This argument becomes overwhelming when  the same association is found in many other cases. There were two  hundred and three doubles in the Catalogue of 1782 alone, and many  thousands are now known.    By a process like this, HERSCHEL reached his grand discovery of true  binary systems, where one sun revolves about another. For he saw that  if the two stars are near together in space, they could not stand still  in face of each other, but that they must revolve in true orbits. Here  was the discovery which came to take the place of the detection of the  parallaxes of the fixed stars.    He had failed in one research, but he was led to grand conclusions.  Was the force that these distant pairs of suns obeyed, the force of  gravitation? This he could not settle, but his successors have done so.  It was not till about 1827 that SAVARY, of the Paris Observatory, showed  that one of HERSCHEL'S doubles was subjected to the law of gravitation,  and thus extended the power of this law from our system to the universe  at large. HERSCHEL himself lived to see some of his double stars perform  half a revolution.    Of HERSCHEL'S discoveries, ARAGO thinks this has \"le plus d'avenir.\"  It may well be so. The laws which govern our solar system have been  extended, through his researches, to regions of unknown distance. The  binary stars will afford the largest field for research into the laws  which govern them, and together with the clusters and groups, they will  give a firm basis by which to study the distribution of stars in  general, since here we have the great advantage of knowing, if not the  real distance of the two stars from the earth, at least that this  distance is alike for both.                        _Researches on Planets and Satellites._    After HERSCHEL'S first publication on the mountains of the Moon (1780),  our satellite appears to have occupied him but little. The observation  of volcanoes (1787) and of a lunar eclipse are his only published ones.  The planets _Mercury_, _Venus_, _Mars_, and _Jupiter_, although they  were often studied, were not the subjects of his more important memoirs.  The planet _Saturn_, on the contrary, seems never to have been lost  sight of from the time of his first view of it in 1772.    The field of discovery always appears to be completely occupied until  the advent of a great man, who, even by his way of putting old and  familiar facts, shows the paths along which discoveries must come, if at  all. This faculty comes from profound reflection on the nature of the  subject itself, from a sort of transmuting power which changes the words  of the books into the things of reality. HERSCHEL'S paper on _Saturn_,  in 1790, is an admirable example of this.    HERSCHEL'S observations on _Saturn_ began in 1772. From 1790 to 1808 he  published six memoirs on the figure, the ring, and the satellites of  this planet. The spheroidal shape of the ball was first discovered by  him, and we owe much of our certain knowledge of the constitution of the  rings to his work. The sixth and seventh satellites, _Mimas_ and  _Enceladus_, were discovered by him in 1789. The periods of rotation of  the ball and of the ring were also fixed. In his conclusions as to the  real figure of the rings, there is a degree of scientific caution which  is truly remarkable, and which to-day seems almost"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29070"],[0,"Brighter Britain! (Volume 1 of 2) (#18)"],[1,"youthful of our party, is by no means the least. He is, in  fact, six feet six inches in height, and is of broad and muscular build.  His private seat is therefore of the ponderous kind. At first sight it  would seem to be of immense strength, since it is made of heavy stakes,  cut in the adjoining bush. These are abundantly jointed with bars and  bolts of the same solid and substantial kind; the seat and back being  composed of sacking. But, in spite of the apparent power displayed by  this fabrication, disastrous accidents are continually happening. The  Little'un has no inborn genius for joinery.    Sometimes it has happened that, as we sat at a meal, a loud crack would  be heard, some part of his throne would give way, and the Little'un  would disappear from view. Shouts of laughter from the rest. Old  Colonial, in high delight, would proceed to show how cleverly the  Little'un had adapted his armchair to his exact weight; and how it was  unable to support the addition of the great load of victuals which that  individual had unthinkingly stowed away. The Little'un would arise  silent and perplexed; and, by-and-by, we would find him deeply pondering  over the manufacture of his scaffolding, and probably shaping another  small tree with his axe to add to it.    The most important items of the shanty's plenishing are the bunks and  beds. The former are made in this way, having been constructed by the  carpenter at the township. A simple folding trestle at head and foot  supports two parallel bars. Across these is stretched and nailed stout  canvas. Each of us has one of these bedsteads, which are very convenient  in the limited dimensions of our shanty, for they can be folded and  stacked out of the way when necessary.    The beds themselves are curiously fabricated. Old potato-sacks,  flour-bags, and the like have been utilized. The stuffing is of fern,  feathers, mounga, and sundry other matters. Each of us has two or more  blankets, which, I regret to say, are a trifle frowsy as a rule.  O'Gaygun's call for special remark.    This descendant of Hibernian kings is content to undergo even greater  inconveniences than he necessarily need do, since he has determined to  make his fortune in the shortest possible space of time. Moreover, he  professes the profoundest contempt for luxury and even comfort. He holds  that almost anything civilized is an effeminacy, and out of place in the  bush, where he considers that life ought to be lived in a stern and  \"natchral\" way. He is intensely conservative in the primitive usages and  habits of the roughest pioneering times, and emphatically condemns any  innovations thereupon. He works with furious zeal and unflagging  energy, and saves all the money he earns, generally investing it in  gold-mine scrip, or something that rarely turns out well.    In the matter of blankets and bedding, the spirit of O'Gaygun's economy  and self-sacrifice is apparent. His bedding is like that of all of us,  except that it is less bulky--O'Gaygun asserting that a soft bed is a  sin. His blankets have long been worn out; in fact, they are the mere  shreds and tatters of what once were blankets. Bunk he has none. It  would go against his principles to get one. If any of us is absent,  O'Gaygun borrows his bunk for the time. When all are present he contents  himself with the inverted table, his especial four-poster.    To see this eccentric Milesian settling himself for the night is  invariably a mirthful spectacle, and, it may be added, that, no one of  us is more volubly humorous and laughter-loving than O'Gaygun himself.  Reclining on the sacks which he has spread out upon the table, he  proceeds to draw his tattered blankets carefully over his lengthy limbs.  Piece by piece he spreads the coverings. First one foot and then  another, then the waist, and so on, until at last he is entirely  covered. The process is troublesome, perhaps; but when it is finished  O'Gaygun lies as warm and comfortable as need be. Why should he go to  the expense of new blankets?    Of course there is in the shanty a litter of cans, kegs, old  packing-cases, and the like, which come into use in various ways. Among  them are the remains of former state, in the shape of certain trunks,  portmanteaus, and boxes. These receptacles held our wardrobes, when we  possessed such things, and the sundry personals we brought with us from  England years ago, and imported up here.    We have long got over the feeling that it is imperative to hoard up  clothes and things in boxes; in fact, we have no longer any clothes and  things that require such disposal. But in the bush everything must serve  some purpose or other; and so all these now disused trunks are turned to  use. One grand old imperial is now a brine-tub, within whose dank and  salt recesses masses of beef and pork are always kept stored ready for  use. Other cases hold sugar, salt, flour, and so on; a uniform case is  now our bread-basket; each has its proper purpose, and is accomplishing  its final destiny. There is a fine leather portmanteau, or what was once  such, now the residence of a colley bitch and her litter of pups.  Mildewed and battered as it is, it still seems to recall to mind faint  memories of English country-houses, carriages, valets, and other  outlandish and foreign absurdities. There must be magic in that old  valise, for, the other day, Dandy Jack was looking at the pups that  live in it, and remarked their kennel. A fragment of schoolboy Latin  came into his head, and, to our astonishment, he murmured, \"_Sic transit  gloria mundi!_\"    To avoid the possibility of any mistakes arising from an admission just  made, I hereby beg to state that we do _not_ consider clothing as  entirely superfluous. But we no longer regard it from any artistic or  ornamental point of view; that would be to derogate from our character  as bushmen. We are not over-burdened with too large a choice of  clothing. Such as we have is pretty much held in common, and all that is  not in immediate use finds a place on the partition-rack, or the shelves  upon it. We are supposed to possess _another_ change of garments apiece,  but no one knows exactly how he stands in this matter, unless it be the  Little'un, whose superior amplitude of limb debars him from the fullest  exercise of communal rights.    Our ordinary costume consists of flannel shirt and moleskin breeches,  boots, socks, leggings, belt, and hat. In chilly and wet weather we  sling a potato-sack, or some ancient apology for a coat, round our  shoulders. When we visit the township, or our married neighbours, we  clean ourselves as much as possible, and put on the best coat we can  find in the shanty. We do not entirely dispense with such things as  towels and handkerchiefs, though the use of them is limited, and  substitutes are employed. Razors, of course, were discarded long ago,  but some antique brushes, and a small piece of cracked looking-glass,  represent the toilette accessories of the shanty.    Our custom is to wear our clothes just as long as they will hold  together, before we renew any garment by purchasing another of its kind  at the township store. There is no time for mending in the bush, so we  are often rather ragged. Washing is a nuisance, but we feel bound to go  through it sometimes; and very knowing laundrymen are we, up to every  dodge for economizing elbow-grease, and yet satisfactorily cleansing the  things. But we do not undertake this work too often. Old Colonial has  laid down a law upon the subject. He says--    \"Frequent washing spoils clothes, and causes them to rot sooner.  Besides, it is unnecessary where there are no women about, and a loss of  time if it trenches on more important work.\"    Dandy Jack is an exception to the common sumptuary habits of the bush.  In fact, he is an exceptional character altogether. Place him where you  will, and he always looks fit for a drawing-room. How he manages it, no  one knows. Many have tried to imitate him, but without success. They  have expended much money, and time, and thought, in the endeavour to  compete with our dandy chum, but have had, sooner or later, to give up  in despair, and return to tatters and grime like the common run of folk.  Dandy Jack always carries a small swag about with him from place to  place, wherever he may temporarily pitch his tent. If he rides, it is  behind his saddle; if he boats, it is beside him; if he walks, it is on  his back. Yet it is not only this that enables him to appear as he does.  Other people can carry swags as well as he. But Dandy Jack has a  peculiar genius which other persons lack. That must be it!    There is one portion of our domicile that we are accustomed to speak of  with a certain fond and lingering reverence. This is THE LIBRARY. High  up in one corner, festooned with cobwebs, are a couple of shelves. Upon  them are a pile of tattered newspapers and periodicals, a row of greasy  volumes, mostly of the novel sort, one or two ancient account-books, and  the fragmentary relics of a desk containing pens, ink, and paper. Such  as it is, our library is more than every establishment like ours can  boast of. There is precious little time for reading or writing in the  bush.    The smaller half of the shanty, divided from the rest and from the  chimney-place by the incomplete partition already spoken of, is termed  by us the dairy. It is not in any way separate from the rest of the  house, though, since we use it and sleep in it as part of the general  apartment. But here, arranged on shelves all round the walls, are tin  dishes and billies, a churn, a cheese-press, and the various  appurtenances of a dairy. Humble and primitive as are these  arrangements, we do yet contrive to turn out a fair amount of butter and  cheese. At such seasons as we have cows in milk, this makes a fair show  to our credit every week, in the ledger of the township storekeeper, our  good friend the Mayor.  "]]]
