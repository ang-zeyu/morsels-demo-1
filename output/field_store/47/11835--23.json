Fine ripe figs hung upon the tree beneath which he had slept; he  stretched forth his hand to pluck some; their taste was delicious, and  then he descended into the brook to slake his thirst. But what was his  horror, when the water showed his head adorned with two immense ears,  and a long thick nose! Amazed, he clapped his hands upon his ears, and  they were really more than half an ell long.    \"I deserve ass's ears!\" he exclaimed; \"for, like an ass, have I  trodden Fortune under my feet.\" He wandered around among the trees,  and feeling hunger again, was obliged to have recourse once more to  the fig-tree, for he could find nothing else that was eatable. After  the second portion of figs, it struck him that if his ears could find  room beneath his large turban, he would not look so ridiculous, and,  on trying it, he found that his ears had vanished. He ran straight  back to the stream, in order to convince himself thereof; it was  actually so; his ears had resumed their original figure, his long  misshapen nose was no more! He soon perceived how all this had  happened; from the first fig-tree he had received the long nose and  ears, the second had relieved him of them: he saw with joy that kind  destiny yet again placed in his hands the means of becoming fortunate.  He plucked, therefore, from each tree as many figs as he could carry,  and went back to the land which shortly before he had left. There, in  the first town, he disguised himself by means of different garments;  then, turning again to the city inhabited by the king, he soon arrived  at it.    For about a year ripe fruit had been quite scarce; Little Muck,  therefore, placed himself before the gate of the palace, for from his  former residence there, it was well known to him, that here such  rareties would be purchased by the kitchen-master for the royal table.  Muck had not long been seated, when he saw that dignitary walking  across the court-yard. He examined the articles of the traders who  had placed themselves at the palace-gate; at length his eye fell upon  Muck's little basket.    \"Ah! a dainty morsel!\" said he, \"which will certainly please his  majesty: what wish you for the whole basket?\" Muck set a high price  upon them, and the bargain was soon struck. The kitchen-master gave  the basket to his slave, and went his way: meantime Little Muck stole  away, for he feared, when the change should show itself on the heads  of the court, that he, as the one who sold them, would be sought for  punishment.    At table the king was well pleased, and praised his kitchen-master  more than ever, on account of his good kitchen, and the care with  which he always sought the rarest morsels for his table; the officer,  however, who well knew what dainties he had in the back-ground, smiled  pleasantly, and let fall but few words: \"The day is not all past till  evening,\" or \"End good, all good;\" so that the princesses were very  curious to know what he would still bring on. The moment, however, he  had the fine, inviting figs set upon the table, a universal \"Ah!\"  escaped the lips of those who were present. \"How ripe! how delicate!\"  exclaimed the king; \"kitchen-master, thou art a whole-souled man, and  deservest our peculiar favor!\" Thus speaking, the king, who with such  choice dishes took care to be very sparing, with his own hands  distributed the figs around the table. Each prince and princess  received two; the ladies of the court, the Viziers and Agas, each one;  the rest he placed before himself, and began to swallow them with  great delight.    \"In the name of heaven, father, why lookest thou so strange?\" suddenly  exclaimed the Princess Amarza. All gazed in astonishment upon the  king; vast ears hung down from his head, a long nose stretched itself  bridge-like, over above his chin; upon themselves also they looked,  one upon another, with amazement and horror; all, more or less, were  adorned with the same strange headdress.    The horror of the court may be imagined. All the physicians in the  city were immediately sent for; they came with a blustering air,  prescribed pills and mixtures, but ears and noses remained. They  operated on one of the princes, but the ears grew out again.    From the place of concealment into which he had withdrawn, Muck had  heard the whole story, and perceived that it was now time for him to  commence operations. He had already, with the money obtained by the  sale of his figs, procured a dress which would represent him as a  learned man; a long beard of goat's hair completed the illusion. With  a small sack full of figs he repaired to the royal palace, and offered  his assistance as a foreign physician. At first they were quite  incredulous; but when Little Muck gave a fig to one of the princes,  and thereby restored ears and nose to their original shape, then were  all eager to be cured by the stranger. But the king took him silently  by the hand, and led him to his apartment; then, opening a door that  led into the treasure-chamber, he made signs to Muck to follow.    \"Here are my treasures,\" said the king; \"choose for thyself: whatever  it may be, it shall be thine, if thou wilt free me from this shameful  evil.\" This was sweet music in the ears of Little Muck: at the moment  of entering he had seen his slippers standing upon the floor, and hard  by lay his little staff. He moved around the room, as if in wonder at  the royal treasures; but no sooner had he reached his beloved shoes,  than he hastily slipped into them, and seizing the little cane, tore  off his false beard, and displayed to the astonished king the  well-known countenance of his exiled Muck.    [Illustration]    \"False king!\" said he, \"who rewardest faithful service with  ingratitude, take, as well-deserved punishment, the deformity which  thou now hast. The ears I leave thee, that, each day they may remind  thee of Little Muck.\" Having thus spoken, he turned quickly around  upon his heel, wished himself far away, and before the king could call  for help Little Muck had vanished. Ever since, he has lived here in  great affluence, but alone, for men he despises. Experience has made  him a wise man--one who, though there is something offensive in his  exterior, deserves rather your admiration than your ridicule.           *       *       *       *       *    Such was my father's story. I assured him that I sincerely repented of  my behavior towards the good little man, and he remitted the other  half of the punishment which he had intended for me. To my comrades I  told the wonderful history of the dwarf, and we conceived such an  affection for him, that no one insulted him any more. On the contrary,  we honored him as long as he lived, and bowed as low to him as to Cadi  or Mufti.           *       *       *       *       *    The travellers determined to rest a day in this caravansery, in order  to refresh themselves and their beasts for the rest of their journey.  The gayety of the day before again prevailed, and they diverted  themselves with various sports. After the meal, however, they called  upon the fifth merchant, Ali Sizah, to perform his duty to the rest,  and give them a story. He answered, that his life was too poor in  remarkable adventures for him to relate one connected therewith, but  he would tell them something which had no relation to it: \"The story  of the False Prince.\"          [Illustration]    THE FALSE PRINCE.      There was once an honest journeyman tailor, by name Labakan, who  learned his trade with an excellent master in Alexandria. It could not  be said that Labakan was unhandy with the needle; on the contrary, he  could make excellent work: moreover, one would have done him injustice  to have called him lazy. Nevertheless, his companions knew not what to  make of him, for he would often sew for hours together so rapidly  that the needle would glow in his hand, and the thread smoke, and that  none could equal him. At another time, however, (and this, alas!  happened more frequently,) he would sit in deep meditation, looking  with his staring eyes straight before him, and with a countenance and  air so peculiar, that his master and fellow-journeymen could say of  his appearance nothing else than, \"Labakan has on again, his  aristocratic face.\"    On Friday, however, when others quietly returned home from prayers to  their labor, Labakan would come forth from the mosque in a fine  garment which with great pains he had made for himself, and walk with  slow and haughty steps through the squares and streets of the city. At  such times, if one of his companions cried, \"Joy be with thee!\" or,  \"How goes it, friend Labakan?\" he would patronizingly give a token of  recognition with his hand, or, if he felt called upon to be very  polite, would bow genteelly with the head. Whenever his master said to  him in jest, \"Labakan, in thee a prince is lost,\" he would be  rejoiced, and answer, \"Have you too observed it?\" or, \"I have already  long thought it.\"    In this manner did the honest journeyman tailor conduct himself for a  long time, while his master tolerated his folly, because, in other  respects, he was a good man and an excellent workman. But one day,  Selim, the sultan's brother, who was travelling through Alexandria,  sent a festival-garment to his master to have some change made in it,  and the master gave it to Labakan, because he did the finest work. In  the evening, when the apprentices had all gone forth to refresh  themselves after the labor of the day, an irresistible desire drove  Labakan back into the workshop, where the garment of the sultan's  brother was hanging. He stood some time, in reflection, before it,  admiring now the splendor of the embroidery, now the varied colors of  the velvet and silk. He cannot help it, he must put it on; and, lo! it  fits him as handsomely as if it were made for him. \"Am not I as good"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24598"],[0,"A Modern History, From the Time of Luther to the Fall of Napoleon (#18)"],[1,"es, when the idea of legitimacy is firmly  impressed on the national mind; and that is, that no subject, or  confederacy of subjects, however powerful, stand much chance in  resisting the claims or the will of a legitimate prince. A nod or a  word, from such a king, can consign the greatest noble to hopeless  impotence. And he can do this from the mighty and mysterious force of  ideas alone. Neither king nor parliament can ever resist the  omnipotence of popular ideas. When ideas establish despots on their  thrones, they are safe. When ideas demand their dethronement, no  forces can long sustain them. The age of Queen Mary was the period of  the most unchecked absolutism in England. Mary was apparently a  powerless woman when Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed queen by the party  of Northumberland, and still she had but to signify her intentions to  claim her rights, and the nation was prostrate at her feet. The  Protestant party dreaded her accession; but loyalty was a stronger  principle than even Protestantism, and she was soon firmly established  in the absolute throne of Henry VIII.    Then almost immediately followed a total change in the administration,  which affected both the political and religious state of the country.  Those who had languished in confinement, on account of their religion,  obtained their liberty, and were elevated to power. Gardiner, Bonner,  and other Catholic bishops, were restored to their sees, while  Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Hooper Coverdale, and other eminent  Protestants, were imprisoned. All the statutes of Edward VI.  pertaining to religion were repealed, and the queen sent assurances to  the pope of her allegiance to his see. Cardinal Pole, descended from  the royal family of England, and a man of great probity, moderation,  and worth, was sent as legate of the pope. Gardiner, Bishop of  Winchester, was made lord chancellor, and became the prime minister.  He and his associates recommended violent councils; and a reign,  unparalleled in England for religious persecution, commenced.    [Sidenote: Marriage of the Queen.]    Soon after the queen's accession, she married Philip, son of the  Emperor Charles, and heir of the Spanish monarchy. This marriage,  brought about by the intrigues of the emperor, and favored by the  Catholic party, was quite acceptable to Mary, whose issue would  inherit the thrones of Spain and England. But ambitious matches are  seldom happy, especially when the wife is much older than the husband,  as was the fact in this instance. Mary, however, was attached to  Philip, although he treated her with great indifference.    This Spanish match, the most brilliant of that age, failed, however,  to satisfy the English, who had no notion of becoming the subjects of  the King of Spain. In consequence of this disaffection, a rebellion  broke out, in which Sir Thomas Wyatt was the most conspicuous, and in  which the Duke of Suffolk, and even the Lady Jane and her husband,  were implicated, though unjustly. The rebellion was easily suppressed,  and the leaders sent to the Tower. Then followed one of the most  melancholy executions of this reign--that of the Lady Jane Grey, who  had been reprieved three months before. The queen urged the plea of  self-defence, and the safety of the realm--the same that Queen  Elizabeth, in after times, made in reference to the Queen of the  Scots. Her unfortunate fate excited great popular compassion, and she  suffered with a martyr's constancy, and also her husband--two  illustrious victims, sacrificed in consequence of the ambition of  their relatives, and the jealousy of the queen. The Duke of Suffolk,  the father of Lady Jane, was also executed, and deserved his fate,  according to the ideas of his age. The Princess Elizabeth expected  also to be sacrificed, both because she was a Protestant and the next  heiress to the throne. But she carefully avoided giving any offence,  and managed with such consummate prudence, that she was preserved for  the future glory and welfare of the realm.    [Sidenote: Religious Persecution.]    The year 1555 opened gloomily for the Protestants. The prisons were  all crowded with the victims of religious persecution, and bigoted  inquisitors had only to prepare their fagots and stakes. Over a  thousand ministers were ejected from their livings, and such as  escaped further persecution fled to the continent. No fewer than two  hundred and eighty-eight persons, among whom were five bishops,  twenty-one clergymen, fifty-five women, and four children, were burned  for religious opinions, besides many thousands who suffered various  other forms of persecution. The constancy of Ridley, Latimer, and  Hooper has immortalized their names on the list of illustrious  martyrs: but the greatest of all the victims was Cranmer, Archbishop  of Canterbury. The most artful and insinuating promises were held out  to him, to induce him to retract. Life and dignities were promised  him, if he would consent to betray his cause. In an evil hour, he  yielded to the temptation, and consented to sell his soul. Timid,  heartbroken, and old, the love of life and the fear of death were  stronger than the voice of conscience and his duty to his God. But,  when he found he was mocked, he came to himself, and suffered  patiently and heroically. His death was glorious, as his life was  useful; and the sincerity of his repentance redeemed his memory from  shame. Cranmer may be considered as the great author of the English  Reformation, and one of the most worthy and enlightened men of his  age; but he was timid, politic, and time-serving. The Reformation  produced no perfect characters in any country. Some great defect  blemished the lives of all the illustrious men who have justly earned  imperishable glory. But the character of such men as Cranmer, and  Ridley, and Latimer, present an interesting contrast to those of  Gardiner and Bonner. The former did show, however, some lenity in the  latter years of this reign of Mary; but the latter, the Bishop of  London, gloated to the last in the blood which he caused to be shed.  He even whipped the Protestant prisoners with his own hands, and once  pulled out the beard of an heretical weaver, and held his finger in  the flame of a candle, till the veins shrunk and burnt, that he might  realize what the pain of burning was. So blind and cruel is religious  intolerance.    But Providence ordered that the religious persecution, which is  attributed to Mary, but which, in strict justice, should be ascribed  to her counsellors and ministers, should prepare the way for a popular  and a spiritual movement in the subsequent reign. The fires of  Smithfield, and the cruelties of the pillory and the prison, opened  the eyes of the nation to the spirit of the old religion, and also  caused the flight of many distinguished men to Frankfort and Geneva,  where they learned the principles of both religious and civil liberty.  \"The blood of martyrs proved the seed of the church\"--a sublime truth,  revealed to Cranmer and Ridley amid the fires which consumed their  venerable bodies; and not to them merely, but to all who witnessed  their serenity, and heard their shouts of triumph when this mortal  passed to immortality. Heretics increased with the progress of  persecution, and firm conviction took the place of a blind confession  of dogmas. \"It was not,\" says Milman, \"until Christ was lain in his  rock-hewn sepulchre, that the history of Christianity commenced.\" We  might add, it was not until the fires of Smithfield were lighted, that  great spiritual ideas took hold of the popular mind, and the intense  religious earnestness appeared which has so often characterized the  English nation. The progress which man makes is generally seen through  disaster, suffering, and sorrow. This is one of the fundamental truths  which history teaches.    [Sidenote: Character of Mary.]    The last years of the reign of Mary were miserable to herself, and  disastrous to the nation. Her royal husband did not return her warm  affections, and left England forever. She embarked in a ruinous war  with France, and gained nothing but disgrace. Her health failed, and  her disposition became gloomy. She continued, to the last, most  intolerant in her religious opinions, and thought more of restoring  Romanism, than of promoting the interests of her kingdom. Her heart  was bruised and broken, and her life was a succession of sorrows. It  is fashionable to call this unfortunate queen the \"bloody Mary,\" and  not allow her a single virtue; but she was affectionate, sincere,  high-minded, and shrunk from the dissimulation and intrigue which  characterized \"the virgin queen\"--the name given to her masculine but  energetic successor. Mary was capable of the warmest friendship; was  attentive and considerate to her servants, charitable to the poor, and  sympathetic with the unfortunate, when not blinded by her religious  prejudices. She had many accomplishments, and a very severe taste, and  was not addicted to oaths, as was Queen Elizabeth and her royal  father. She was, however, a bigoted Catholic; and how could partisan  historians see or acknowledge her merits?    [Sidenote: Accession of Elizabeth.]    But her reign was disastrous, and the nation hailed with enthusiasm  the accession of Elizabeth, on the 17th of November, 1558. With her  reign commences a new epoch, even in the history of Europe. Who does  not talk of the Elizabethan era, when Protestantism was established in  England, when illustrious poets and philosophers adorned the  literature of the country, when commerce and arts received a great  impulse, when the colonies in North America were settled, and when a  constellation of great statesmen raised England to a pitch of glory  not before attained?           *       *       *       *       *         REFERENCES.--See Hume's, and Lingard's, and other standard       Histories of England; Miss Strickland's Lives of the"]]]
