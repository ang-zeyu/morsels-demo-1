Having laid the  foundations he will confine himself at the outset to works in his own  tongue; choosing his literature for each succeeding phase of the  Revolution in turn. But until he has obtained a thorough groundwork and  has acquired sufficient knowledge to enable him to explore the more  famous works in French, it were profitless to devour the scraps afforded  by dubious memoir writers.    If we read three books consecutively on any one subject, we know not  merely three times as much as if we had read one only, but thirty times.  And our knowledge of the subject will not be vague, inaccurate and  fleeting, but it will be concise, accurate and permanent. To acquire a  correct and lasting knowledge of any subject, whether it be an event or  an epoch of history, a science or an art or craft, it is essential that  we read consecutively and comparatively as many books upon that subject  as our opportunities and time allow. It should also be borne in mind that  if we are content to read one volume only, it is quite possible that we  may chance upon an author who is inaccurate or biased, or whose work does  not represent the latest stage of our knowledge upon that subject.

[29] There is no doubt that Burton was largely indebted to Payne for his  'translation'; indeed he is said merely to have paraphrased and  rearranged the version which Payne had just previously prepared for the  Villon Society, adding explanatory notes of a character which renders it  essential that his edition be kept under lock and key. It was issued to  subscribers by Burton himself in London (though ostensibly 'by the  Kamashastra Society at Benares'), being printed, and probably bound, by  Brill at Leyden. The Kamashastra Society was a myth. The ten volumes  (1885-6) were sold to the subscribers at ten guineas the set, and the  entire edition (1000) was subscribed for before publication. (_Ex  inform_: E. H.-A., one of the original subscribers and a friend of  Burton.) Six volumes of _Supplemental Nights_ were issued by Burton  between 1886 and 1888. A set of the sixteen volumes now costs about forty  pounds. It was reprinted (by H. S. Nichols) in 1894, in twelve volumes,  only slightly expurgated, the present price being about twelve pounds. A  supplementary volume of illustrations was issued with this last edition.    [30] Mr. Frederic Harrison.    [31] Isaac Disraeli.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER IV    CHIVALRY AND ROMANCE        'Mekely, lordynges gentyll and fre,       Lysten awhile and herken to me.'                            HUE DE ROTELANDE.      ONCE upon a time, long long before the Venerable Bede had completed that  famous last chapter in his cell at Jarrow, there lived in the ancient  capital of Sampsiceramus, a holy man named Heliodorus. Now in his youth  Heliodorus (as is not uncommon with the young) had turned his thoughts to  worldly things; and being of a romantic nature, wearied by the eternal  sameness of the books available to him, had conceived the extraordinary  notion of writing an untrue book, a book that should never instruct or  point a moral or show you where you are wrong, but should be all  joyousness and enchantment. Possessed with this great idea, timidly yet  sure of himself, he set to work.    The very first thing he did was sufficiently startling for those days.  Instead of selecting some great man for his central figure and putting  his dialogue into the mouths of learned men, fathers of the church,  philosophers, orators, or famous poets, he chose deliberately a young and  handsome man of no particular learning, and--a woman! It was unheard of!  A book, a voluminous roll closely written, containing nothing but the  adventures of a pair of lovers! Monstrous! Yet it was done at last, and  the roll, finding favour in the eyes of a bosom friend, was quickly  passed from hand to hand. All were entranced by it. Here was a book that  had characters one could understand, for whom one could even feel  affection. The loves of dashing young Theagenes and his dear Chariclea  found an echo in many a youthful breast.    Meanwhile Heliodorus disappears from view, and for many years we hear  nothing of him until suddenly he reappears as a bishop in Thessaly! Now  comes the sequel to his audacious design, but for which it is doubtful if  we should ever have heard of him. A synod was convened, and Heliodorus  was condemned _because in his youth he had written a novel_. He was given  his choice between bishopric and book, to retain the one he must destroy  the other by word as well as by deed.    At first sight the choice appears not difficult to make, for although so  laical and original a work had proved to be popular, yet such popularity  was hardly of a nature to appeal to so devout a Christian as one who had  already attained episcopal rank. But to Heliodorus his work (which may  well have been the employment of some years) stood for all that he held  most dear. It was his conception of the ideal in worldly--as opposed to  spiritual--life. Less austere, perhaps, than many of the fathers of the  early Church whose works had seemed so tedious to him in his youth, his  devoutness was tempered largely with a charity and forgiveness that were  not unworthy of his creed. It was impossible to deny those principles of  chivalric virtue and chastity which his novel preached, so he chose to  stand by his book rather than by his benefice, and quitted Thessaly.    So runs the pleasing tale of Nicephorus. But alas! the relentless voice  of modern research will have it that the real author was not the bishop  at all, but a Sophist who lived in the third century of our era. Be it as  it may, I for my part shall go on believing the old romantic tale until  a better one is invented for the Sophist.    The work itself is called 'Ten Books of Aethiopian History,' for the  first and last scenes are laid in Egypt, but it is better known by the  name of its hero and heroine. Its popularity was immense, and it was soon  translated into 'almost all languages.' Later Pere Amyot published a  version in French for Francis I., who was so delighted with the result  that he made the translator abbe of Belozane. Racine tells us it was this  ancient romance that first fired his imagination with the desire to  write. His tutor discovered him absorbed in its contents, and snatching  it from his hand angrily consigned it to the fire. Racine bought another  copy, which suffered a like fate. But so strong a hold upon him had the  story, that he purchased a third, and devoured it in secret, offering it  to his master with a smile when he had thoroughly mastered its contents.    It seems that this ancient Greek romance was lost for many centuries. At  the sack of Buda in 1526, however, a manuscript of it was discovered in  the royal library, where it had once formed part of the vast library  amassed by Matthias Corvinus, the great King of Hungary. Matthias is said  to have 'spoken almost all the European languages,' so doubtless he had  passed many a pleasant hour with the tale. This manuscript (others have  since been discovered) was printed at Basel 'in officina Ioan Hervagii'  in 1534, a small quarto printed with Greek types.[32]    That the early romances of chivalry possess a charm for the  book-collector it is impossible to deny. They are 'a series of books,'  writes Mr. John Ormsby, 'which, complete, would be a glory to any library  in the world; which, in first editions, would now probably fetch a sum  almost large enough to endow a college; and which . . . . is perhaps  . . . . as worthless a set of books as could be made up out of the refuse  novels of a circulating library.' Times without number they have been  derided and decried, even in the days when they were popular. The curate  of La Mancha was not the only one who disapproved of them. 'In our  fathers tyme,' wrote old Roger Ascham, judging the flock by a few black  sheep, 'nothing was red, but bookes of fayned cheualrie, wherein a man by  redinge, shuld be led to none other ende, but onely to manslaughter and  baudrye.' Possevino, a learned Jesuit and famous preacher of the  sixteenth century, used to complain that for the last five hundred years  the princes of Europe had read nothing but romances. Rene d'Anjou  listened to his chaplain inveighing against Launcelot, Amadis, and the  romances of which he was particularly fond; but, says Villeneuve, while  respecting the preacher for his boldness, the king continued to read  them, and even composed new volumes in imitation of them.[33]    Full of monstrous fictions some of these ancient stories undoubtedly are.  It were foolish to expect that all of them should attain the high level  of those great legends which centre about the Holy Grail. Good things  have ever been imitated indifferently; and it was only the later series  of tales which had to do chiefly with enchantments and fairies and  'giaunts, hard to be beleeved.' But alas! all alike have come under the  ban of those who decry reading for recreation's sake. Good and bad have  been damn'd indifferently. One cannot help wondering however that so much  has been written against them, and that so many have been at pains to  point out their unreasonableness. One would have thought that the very  fact of them _all_ abounding with incidents that are not only impossible  but preposterous, would have given these critics pause, and have urged  them to ask themselves why and wherefore such things were repeated.

The bastions stood out in bold relief,  the church tower with its crenellated top stood out against the rocky  peaks, the sun fell suddenly behind the hill, and the traveller felt  himself again a minstrel wandering in a mediaeval night.    [Illustration: \"THE LONG LINES OF WALLS THAT ZIGZAG DOWN THE  HILLSIDE.\"--ENTREVAUX.]      [Sidenote: Sisteron.]    The traveller is curious,--frankly curious. Almost every time that he  enters a Cathedral, his memory recalls the words of Renan, \"these  splendid marvels are almost always the blossoming of some little  deceit,\" and after he has feasted his eye, he thinks of history and of  details, and of Renan, prejudiced but well-informed, and wonders what  was here the \"little deceit.\" At Grasse, he had longed for the papers a  certain lawyer has, which tell much of the city's life a hundred and  fifty years ago, and at Sisteron, he sat by the Durance, wondering how  he could induce a kind and good old lady of a remote corner of Provence  to lend him an ancient manuscript, which even the gentle Cure said she  \"obstinately\" refused to \"impart.\" Blessed are they who can be satisfied  with guide-books, as his friends who had visited Avignon and Arles,  Tarascon and the Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, and had seen Provence to  their entire edification while he was merely peering about  Notre-Dame-des-Doms and the Fort Saint-Andre. Of a more indolent and  leisurely turn of mind, he suffers--and perhaps justly--the penalty of  his joyous idleness, for even lawyers and good ladies with hidden papers  are rare. Revolutionary sieges, fires, and a wise discretion have led to  the destroying of many a fine old page, and it is often in vain one goes  to these decaying cities of Provence. \"We see,\" he said, gesticulating  dejectedly, \"we see their towers and their walls, but if we say we know  that place, how many times do we deceive ourselves. It is too often as  though we claimed to know the life and thought and passions of a man  from looking on his grave.\"    But--to consider what we may know. Sisteron is an old Roman city, most  strongly and picturesquely built in a narrow defile of the Durance. On  one side the river is the high, bare rock of La Baume; on the other, a  higher rock where houses, supporting each other by outstretched  buttresses, seem to cling to the sheer hillside as shrubs in mountain  crevasses, and are dominated and protected by a large and formidable  fortress-castle that crowns the very top of the peak. The town walls are  almost gone; the fortress is abandoned; since the Revolution there are  no longer Bishops in Sisteron; but the old town has lost little of its  war-like and romantic atmosphere of days when it commanded an important  pass, and when the way across the Durance was guarded by a drawbridge,  and a big portcullis that now stands in rusty idleness.    [Illustration: \"THE CHURCH TOWER STOOD OUT AGAINST THE ROCKY  PEAKS.\"--ENTREVAUX.]    It is claimed that the Bishopric of this stronghold was founded in the  IV century, and grew and flourished mightily, until the Bishop dwelt  securely on his rock, his Brother of Gap had a \"box\" on the opposite  bank, the Convent of the little Dominican Sisters was further up the  river, and, besides this busy ecclesiastical life, there was the world  of burghers in the town and its Convent of Ursulines. Here came once  upon a time a sprightly lady who added a thousand lively interests. This  was Louise de Cabris, sister of the great Mirabeau, \"who, when a mere  girl, had been married to the Marquis de Cabris. Part knave, part fool,  the vices of de Cabris sometimes ended in attacks of insanity. His  marriage with one who united the violence of the Mirabeaus to the  license of the Vassans was unfortunate; ... and after Louise began to  reign in the big dark house of the Cours of Grasse, life never lacked  for incidents.\" Matters were not mended by the arrival of her brother,  twenty-four and wild, and supposed to be living under a \"lettre de  cachet\" in the sleepy little town of Manosque. The two were soon  embroiled in so outrageous a scandal that their father, who loved a  quarrel for its own sake, sided with the prosecution; and declaring that  \"no children like his had ever been seen under the sun,\" took out a  \"lettre de cachet\" for Louise, who was sent up to Sisteron, where he  requested her to \"repent of her sins at leisure in the Convent of the  Ursulines.\" Inheriting a brilliant, restless wit and unbridled morals,  her life with the stupid, vicious Marquis had not improved her natural  disposition, and she soon set Sisteron agog. On pretence of business all  the lawyers flocked to see her; and with no pretence at all the garrison  flocked in their train. When the Ursulines ventured to remonstrate, she  diverted them with such anecdotes of gay adventure as were never found  between the pages of their prayer-books. Finally the whole town was  divided into two camps; her foes called her \"a viper,\" and many an eye  peered into the dark streets, many a head was judiciously hidden behind  bowed shutters, to see who went toward the Convent; till by wit and  scheming and after some months of most surprising incident, Louise  carried her point, left the good Ursulines to a well-merited repose,  and returned to the Castle of Mirabeau,--to laugh at the townsfolk of  Sisteron.    [Illustration: \"THE CATHEDRAL IS NEAR THE HEAVY, ROUND TOWERS OF THE  OUTER RAMPARTS.\"--SISTERON.]    [Illustration: \"THE BRIDGE ACROSS THE DURANCE.\"--SISTERON.]    When in the city, the prelates occupied their Castle of the Citadel with  the high lookouts and defences, far from their Cathedral, which is in  the lower town near the heavy, round towers of the ramparts. This  church, which has been very slightly and very judiciously restored, is  of unknown date, probably of the XII century, it is faithful to the  native architectural tradition, and in some details more interesting  than many of the Provencal Cathedrals. Its exterior is small and low.  There are the familiar, friendly little apses of the Romanesque; near  them, above the east end of the north aisle, the squat tower with a  modest, modern spire; and at its side, above the roof-line, is the  octagon that stands over the dome. All this structure is unaffectedly  simple. The walls and buttresses which enclose the aisles are plain, and  it is only by comparison with this architectural Puritanism that the  facade may be considered ornate. Near the top of its wall, which is  supported by sturdy piers, are three round windows, with deep, splayed  frames. The largest of them is directly above the high, slender portal  that is somewhat reminiscent of the Italian influence, so elaborately  marked further up the valley, at Embrun. The rounded arch of the  door-way and its pointed gable are repeated, on either side, in a  half-arch and half-gable. An allegorical animal, in relief, stands above  the central arch, and a few columns with delicate capitals complete the  adornment of the entrance-way, which, in spite of being the most  decorative part of the church, is most discreet.    Nine steps lead down into an interior that is small, very usually  planned, and much defaced by XVII century gilt--yet is essentially  dignified and impressive. Eliminate the tawdry altars, take away the  stucco Saints and painted Virgins, let the chapels be mere shadowy  corners in the dark perspective, and the little church appears like the  meeting-place of the Faithful of an early Christianity. Its nave and  each of the narrow side aisles rise to round tunnel-vaults; there are  but five bays, and the last is covered by a small, octagonal dome. The  whole church is built of a dark stone that is almost black, its lighting  is very dim, and centres in the little apses where the holiest statues  stand and the most sacred rites are celebrated; and the worshippers,  shrouded in twilight, have more of the atmosphere of mystery than is  usual in the Cathedrals of Provence, the subtle influence of quiet  shadowy darkness that is so potent in the churches of the Spanish  borderland.    [Illustration: \"ENTRANCES TO TWO NARROW STREETS.\"--SISTERON.]    Many will pass through Sisteron and enjoy its rugged strength, its  sun-lit days, its narrow streets, and the peaks that stand out in solemn  sternness against the dark blue sky at night. Notre-Dame-de-Pomeriis has  none of the salient beauty of any of these, and to appreciate its  ancient charm, it must not be forgotten that the Provencal Cathedral has  not the distinction of size or the elaboration of the greater Cathedrals  of Gascony, that it is far removed from the fine originalities of  Languedoc, that it is conventional, and, as it were, clannish, and that  its highest dignity is in a simple quiet that is never awe-full. There  is, in truth, more than one church of this country that needs the  embellishment of its history to make it truly interesting. But  Notre-Dame of Sisteron is not of these. It is not the big, empty shell  of Carpentras, nor the little rough Cathedral of Orange. It is the  smaller, more perfect one, of finer inspiration, which the many will  pass by, the few enjoy.          IV.    CATHEDRALS OF THE VALLEYS.      [Sidenote: Orange.]    Lying on the Rhone, and almost surrounded by the papal Venaissin, is a  tiny principality of less than forty thousand acres. This small state  has given title to more than one distinguished European who never  entered its borders, and who was alien to it not only in birth, but in  language and family. So great was the fame of its rulers that this  small, isolated strip of land suffered for their principles, and  probably owes to them much of its devastation in the terrible Wars of  Religion. From the well-known convictions of the Princes of Orange, the  country was always counted a refuge for heretics of all shades, and in  1338 they were in sufficient force to demolish the tower of "]]]
