ECCLES.      [Music]    Plague us not with idle Stories,    Whining Loves, whining Loves, whining Loves,          And Senceless Glories.    What are Lovers? what are Kings?    What, at best, but slavish Things?    What are Lovers? what are Kings?    What, at best, but slavish Things?    What, at best, but slavish Things?    Free I liv'd as Nature made me,  Love nor Beauty durst invade me,  No rebellious Slaves betray'd me,  Free I liv'd as Nature made me,  Each by turns as Sence inspired me,  _Bacchus_, _Ceres_, _Venus_ fir'd me,  I alone have learnt true Pleasure,  Freedom, Freedom, Freedom is the only, only Treasure.          JUNO _in the Prize._    _Set by Mr._ JOHN WELDON.      [Music]    Let Ambition fire thy Mind,    Thou wert born o'er Men to Reign;  Not to follow Flocks design'd,    Scorn thy Crook, and leave the Plain:  Not to follow Flocks design'd,    Scorn thy Crook, and leave the Plain.    Crowns I'll throw beneath thy Feet,    Thou on Necks of Kings shalt tread,  Joys in Circles, Joys shall meet,    Which way e're thy fancy leads.          _The Beau's Character in the Comedy call'd_ Hampstead-Heath. _Set and  Sung by Mr._ Ramondon.      [Music]          A Whig that's full,        An empty Scull,  A Box of _Burgamot_;        A Hat ne'er made        To fit his Head  No more than that to Plot.        A Hand that's White,        A Ring that's right,  A Sword, Knot, Patch and Feather;        A Gracious Smile,        And Grounds and Oyl,  Do very well together.          A smatch of _French_,        And none of Sence,  All Conquering Airs and Graces;        A Tune that Thrills,        A Lear that Kills,  Stoln Flights and borrow'd Phrases.        A Chariot Gilt,        To wait on Jilt,  An awkward Pace and Carriage;        A Foreign Tower,        Domestick Whore,  And Mercenary Marriage.          A Limber Ham,        G---- D---- ye M'am,  A Smock-Face, tho' a Tann'd one;        A Peaceful Sword,        Not one wise Word,  But State and Prate at Random.        Duns, Bastards, Claps,        And Am'rous Scraps,  Of _Caelia_ and _Amadis_;        Toss up a Beau,        That Grand Ragou,  That Hodge-Podge for the Ladies.          _A_ SONG _in the Innocent Mistress. Set by Mr._ John Eccles, _Sung by  Mrs._ Hodgson.      [Music]    When I languish'd and wish'd you wou'd something bestow,    You bad me to give it a Name;  But by Heav'n I know it as little as you,    Tho' my Ignorance passes for Shame:  You take for Devotion each passionate Glance,    And think the dull Fool is sincere;  But never believe that I spake in Romance,    On purpose to tickle, on purpose, on purpose,    On purpose to tickle your Ear:  To please me than more, think still I am true,  And hug each Apocryphal Text;  Tho' I practice a Thousand false Doctrines on you,    I shall still have enough, I shall still have enough,    Shall still have enough for the next.          VENUS _to_ PARIS _in the Prize Musick. Set by Mr._ JOHN WELDON.      [Music]    Hither turn thee, hither turn thee, hither turn thee gentle Swain,  Hither turn thee, hither turn thee, hither turn thee gentle Swain,  Let not _Venus_, let not _Venus_, let not _Venus_ sue in vain;  _Venus_ rules, _Venus_ rules, _Venus_ rules the Gods above,  Love rules them, Love rules them, Love rules them, and she rules Love?    _Venus_ rules the Gods above,  Love rules them, Love rules them, Love rules them,  Love rules them, Love rules them, and she rules Love.    Love rules them, and she rules Love.          _A_ SONG.    _The Words by Mr._ WARD, _Set by Mr._ HARRIS.      [Music]    _Belinda_! why do you distrust,    So faithful and so kind a Heart:  Which cannot prove to you unjust,    But must it self endure the smart:  No, no, no, no the wandring Stars,    Shall sooner cease their Motion;  And Nature reconcile the Jars,    'Twixt _Boreas_ and the Ocean:  The fixed Poles shall seem to move,    And ramble from their Places;  E'er I'll from fair _Belinda_ rove,    Or slight her charming Graces.          _A_ SONG.    _Set by Mr._ William Turner.      [Music]    Long was the Day e're _Alexis_ my Lover,    To finish my Hopes would his Passion reveal;  He could not speak, nor I could not discover,    What my poor aking Heart was so loath to conceal:  Till the Strength of his Passion his Fear had remov'd,  Then we mutually talk'd, and we mutually lov'd.    Groves for Umbrella's did kindly o'er-shade us,    From _Phoebus_ hot rages, who like envy in strove;  Had not kind Fate this Provision made us,    All the Nymphs of the Air would have envy'd our Love:  But we stand below Envy that ill-natur'd Fate,  And above cruel Scorn is happy Estate.          _A_ SONG.    _Set to Musick by Mr._ John Eccles.      [Music]    As _Cupid_ roguishly one Day,  Had all alone stole out to play;  The _Muses_ caught the little, little, little Knave,  And captive Love to Beauty gave:  The _Muses_ caught the little, little, little Knave,  And captive Love to Beauty gave:  The laughing Dame soon miss'd her Son,  And here and there, and here and there,    And here and there distracted run;  Distracted run, and here and there,    And here and there, and here and there distracted run:  And still his Liberty to gain, his Liberty to gain,    Offers his Ransom,  But in vain, in vain, in vain;  The willing, willing Prisoner still hugs his Chain,  And Vows he'll ne'er be free,  And Vows he'll ne'er be free,  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  No, no, no, no, no he'll ne'er be free again,  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  No, no, no, no, no he'll ne'er be free again.          _Old_ SOLDIERS.      [Music]    Of old Soldiers, the Song you would hear,  And we old Fidlers have forgot who they were,  But all we remember shall come to your Ear,      _That we are old Soldiers of the Queens,_      _And the Queens old Soldiers._    With the _Old Drake_, that was the next Man  To _Old Franciscus_, who first it began,  To sail through the Streights of _Magellan_,      _Like an old Soldier_, &c.    That put the proud _Spanish Armado_ to wrack,  And Travell'd all o'er the old World, and came back,  In his old Ship, laden with Gold and old Sack,      _Like an old Soldier_, &c.    With an _Old Cavendish_, that seconded him,  And taught his old Sails the same Passage to swim,  And did them therefore with Cloth of Gold Trim,      _Like an old Soldier_, &c.    Like an _Old Rawleigh_, that twice and again,  Sailed over most part of the _Seas_, and then  Travell'd all o'er the World with his Pen,      _Like an old Soldier_, &c.    With an _Old John Norris_, the General,  That at old _Gaunt_, made his Fame Immortal,  In spight of his Foes, with no loss at all,      _Like an old Soldier_, &c.    Like _Old Brest Fort_, an invincible thing,  When the old _Queen_ sent him to help the _French_ King,  Took from the proud _Fox_, to the World's wond'ring,      _Like an old Soldier_, &c.    Where an old stout _Fryer_, as goes the Story,  Came to push of Pike with him in Vain-glory,  But he was almost sent to his own _Purgatory_,      _By this old Soldier_, &c.    With an _Old Ned Norris_, that kept _Ostend_,  A terror to Foe, and a Refuge to Friend,  And left it Impregnable to his last End,      _Like an old Soldier_, &c.    That in the old unfortunate Voyage of all,  March'd o'er the old Bridge, and knock'd at the Wall,  Of _Lisbon_, the Mistress of _Portugal_,      _Like an old Soldier_, &c.    With an _Old Tim Norris_, by the old _Queen_ sent,  Of _Munster_ in _Ireland_, Lord President,  Where his Days and his Blood in her service he spent,      _Like an old Soldier_, &c.    With an _Old Harry Norris_, in Battle wounded,  In his Knee, whose Leg was cut off, and he said,  You have spoil'd my Dancing, and dy'd in his Bed,      _Like an old Soldier_, &c.    With an _Old Will Norris_, the oldest of all,  Who went voluntary, without any Call,  To th' old _Irish_ Wars, to's Fame Immortal,      _Like an old Soldier_, &c.    With an _Old Dick Wenman_, the first in his Prime,  That over the Walls of old _Cales_ did Clime,  And there was Knighted, and liv'd all his Time,      _Like an old Soldier_, &c.    With _Old Nando Wenman_, when _Brest_ was o'er thrown,  Into the Air, into the Seas, with Gunpowder blown,  Yet bravely recovering, long after was known,      _For an Old Soldier_, &c.    When an _Old Tom Wenman_, whose bravest delight,  Was in a good Cause for his Country to Fight,  And dy'd in _Ireland_, a good old Knight,      _And an old Soldier_, &c.    With a Young _Ned Wenman_, so valiant and bold,  In the Wars of _Bohemia_, as with the Old,  Deserves for his Valour to be Enroll'd,      _An old Soldier_, &c.    And thus of Old Soldiers, ye hear the Fame,  But ne'er so many of one House and Name,  And all of old _John Lord Viscount_ of _Thame_,      _An old Soldier of the Queens,_      _And the Queens old Soldier._          _On the Tombs in_ Westminster Abby.      _You must suppose it to be_ Easter _Holy-Days: At what time_ Sisly  _and_ Dol, Kate _and_ Peggy, Moll _and_ Nan, _are marching to_  Westminster, _with a Leash of Prentices before 'em; who go rowing  themselves along with their right Arms to make more hast, and now and  then with a greasie Muckender wipe away the dripping that bastes their  Foreheads. At the Door they meet a crowd of_ Wapping _Sea-men_,  Southwark _Broom-men, the Inhabitants of the_ Bank-Side, _with a  Butcher or two prickt in among them. There a while they stand gaping  for the Master of the Show, staring upon the Suburbs of their dearest  delight, just as they stand gaping upon the painted Cloth before they  go into the Puppet Play. By and by they hear the Bunch of Keys, which  rejoyces their Hearts like the sound of the_ Pancake-Bell. _For now  the Man of Comfort peeps over the Spikes, and beholding such a learned  Auditory, opens the Gate of_ Paradise, _and by that time they are half  got into the first Chapel, (for time is very precious)"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2681"],[0,"Ten Years Later (#18)"],[1,"conduct,  Buckingham felt himself attracted towards Raoul almost in spite of  himself. He often entered into conversation with him, and it was nearly  always to talk to him either of his father or of D'Artagnan, their  mutual friend, in whose praise Buckingham was nearly as enthusiastic as  Raoul. Raoul endeavored, as much as possible, to make the conversation  turn upon this subject in De Wardes's presence, who had, during the  whole journey, been exceedingly annoyed at the superior position taken  by Bragelonne, and especially by his influence over De Guiche. De Wardes  had that keen and merciless penetration most evil natures possess; he  had immediately remarked De Guiche's melancholy, and divined the nature  of his regard for the princess. Instead, however, of treating the  subject with the same reserve which Raoul practiced; instead of  regarding with that respect, which was their due, the obligations  and duties of society, De Wardes resolutely attacked in the count the  ever-sounding chord of juvenile audacity and pride. It happened one  evening, during a halt at Mantes, that while De Guiche and De Wardes  were leaning against a barrier, engaged in conversation, Buckingham and  Raoul were also talking together as they walked up and down. Manicamp  was engaged in devoted attendance on the princess, who already treated  him without reserve, on account of his versatile fancy, his frank  courtesy of manner, and conciliatory disposition.    \"Confess,\" said De Wardes, \"that you are really ill, and that your  pedagogue of a friend has not succeeded in curing you.\"    \"I do not understand you,\" said the count.    \"And yet it is easy enough; you are dying of love.\"    \"You are mad, De Wardes.\"    \"Madness it would be, I admit, if Madame were really indifferent to your  martyrdom; but she takes so much notice of it, observes it to such an  extent, that she compromises herself, and I tremble lest, on our arrival  at Paris, M. de Bragelonne may not denounce both of you.\"    \"For shame, De Wardes, again attacking De Bragelonne.\"    \"Come, come, a truce to child's play,\" replied the count's evil genius,  in an undertone; \"you know as well as I do what I mean. Besides, you  must have observed how the princess's glance softens as she looks at  you;--you can tell, by the very inflection of her voice, what pleasure  she takes in listening to you, and can feel how thoroughly she  appreciates the verses you recite to her. You cannot deny, too, that  every morning she tells you how indifferently she slept the previous  night.\"    \"True, De Wardes, quite true; but what good is there in your telling me  all that?\"    \"Is it not important to know the exact position of affairs?\"    \"No, no; not when I am a witness of things that are enough to drive one  mad.\"    \"Stay, stay,\" said De Wardes; \"look, she calls you,--do you understand?  Profit by the occasion, while your pedagogue is absent.\"    De Guiche could not resist; an invincible attraction drew him towards  the princess. De Wardes smiled as he saw him withdraw.    \"You are mistaken, monsieur,\" said Raoul, suddenly stepping across  the barrier against which the previous moment the two friends had been  leaning. \"The pedagogue is here, and has overheard you.\"    De Wardes, at the sound of Raoul's voice, which he recognized without  having occasion to look at him, half drew his sword.    \"Put up your sword,\" said Raoul; \"you know perfectly well that, until  our journey is at an end, every demonstration of that nature is useless.  Why do you distill into the heart of the man you term your friend all  the bitterness that infects your own? As regards myself, you wish to  arouse a feeling of deep dislike against a man of honor--my father's  friend and my own; and as for the count you wish him to love one who  is destined for your master. Really, monsieur, I should regard you as  a coward, and a traitor too, if I did not, with greater justice, regard  you as a madman.\"    \"Monsieur,\" exclaimed De Wardes, exasperated, \"I was deceived, I find,  in terming you a pedagogue. The tone you assume, and the style which  is peculiarly your own, is that of a Jesuit, and not of a gentleman.  Discontinue, I beg, whenever I am present, this style I complain of, and  the tone also. I hate M. d'Artagnan, because he was guilty of a cowardly  act towards my father.\"    \"You lie, monsieur,\" said Raoul, coolly.    \"You give me the lie, monsieur?\" exclaimed De Wardes.    \"Why not, if what you assert is untrue?\"    \"You give me the lie, and will not draw your sword?\"    \"I have resolved, monsieur, not to kill you until Madame shall have been  delivered safely into her husband's hands.\"    \"Kill me! Believe me, monsieur, your schoolmaster's rod does not kill so  easily.\"    \"No,\" replied Raoul, sternly, \"but M. d'Artagnan's sword kills; and, not  only do I possess his sword, but he has himself taught me how to use it;  and with that sword, when a befitting time arrives, I will avenge his  name--a name you have dishonored.\"    \"Take care, monsieur,\" exclaimed De Wardes; \"if you do not immediately  give me satisfaction, I will avail myself of every means to revenge  myself.\"    \"Indeed, monsieur,\" said Buckingham, suddenly, appearing upon the  scene of action, \"that is a threat which savors of assassination, and  therefore, ill becomes a gentleman.\"    \"What did you say, my lord?\" said De Wardes, turning round towards him.    \"I said, monsieur, that the words you have just spoken are displeasing  to my English ears.\"    \"Very well, monsieur, if what you say is true,\" exclaimed De Wardes,  thoroughly incensed, \"I at least find in you one who will not escape me.  Understand my words as you like.\"    \"I take them in the manner they cannot but be understood,\" replied  Buckingham, with that haughty tone which characterized him, and which,  even in ordinary conversation, gave a tone of defiance to everything he  said; \"M. de Bragelonne is my friend, you insult M. de Bragelonne, and  you shall give me satisfaction for that insult.\"    De Wardes cast a look upon De Bragelonne, who, faithful to the character  he had assumed, remained calm and unmoved, even after the duke's  defiance.    \"It would seem that I did not insult M. de Bragelonne, since M. de  Bragelonne, who carries a sword by his side, does not consider himself  insulted.\"    \"At all events you insult someone.\"    \"Yes, I insulted M. d'Artagnan,\" resumed De Wardes, who had observed  that this was the only means of stinging Raoul, so as to awaken his  anger.    \"That, then,\" said Buckingham, \"is another matter.\"    \"Precisely so,\" said De Wardes; \"it is the province of M. d'Artagnan's  friends to defend him.\"    \"I am entirely of your opinion,\" replied the duke, who had regained all  his indifference of manner; \"if M. de Bragelonne were offended, I could  not reasonably be expected to espouse his quarrel, since he is himself  here; but when you say that it is a quarrel of M. d'Artagnan--\"    \"You will of course leave me to deal with the matter,\" said De Wardes.    \"Nay, on the contrary, for I draw my sword,\" said Buckingham,  unsheathing it as he spoke; \"for if M. d'Artagnan injured your father,  he rendered, or at least did all that he could to render, a great  service to mine.\"    De Wardes was thunderstruck.    \"M. d'Artagnan,\" continued Buckingham, \"is the bravest gentleman I know.  I shall be delighted, as I owe him many personal obligations, to settle  them with you, by crossing my sword with yours.\" At the same moment  Buckingham drew his sword from its scabbard, saluted Raoul, and put  himself on guard.    De Wardes advanced a step to meet him.    \"Stay, gentlemen,\" said Raoul, advancing towards them, and placing his  own drawn sword between the combatants, \"the affair is hardly worth the  trouble of blood being shed almost in the presence of the princess.  M. de Wardes speaks ill of M. d'Artagnan, with whom he is not even  acquainted.\"    \"What, monsieur,\" said De Wardes, setting his teeth hard together, and  resting the point of his sword on the toe of his boot, \"do you assert  that I do not know M. d'Artagnan?\"    \"Certainly not; you do not know him,\" replied Raoul, coldly, \"and you  are even not aware where he is to be found.\"    \"Not know where he is?\"    \"Such must be the case, since you fix your quarrel with him upon  strangers, instead of seeking M. d'Artagnan where he is to be found.\" De  Wardes turned pale. \"Well, monsieur,\" continued Raoul, \"I will tell you  where M. d'Artagnan is: he is now in Paris; when on duty he is to be  met with at the Louvre,--when not on duty, in the Rue des Lombards.  M. d'Artagnan can easily be discovered at either of those two places.  Having, therefore, as you assert, so many causes of complaint against  him, show your courage in seeking him out, and afford him an opportunity  of giving you that satisfaction you seem to ask of every one but of  himself.\" De Wardes passed his hand across his forehead, which was  covered with perspiration. \"For shame, M. de Wardes! so quarrelsome  a disposition is hardly becoming after the publication of the edicts  against duels. Pray think of that; the king will be incensed at our  disobedience, particularly at such a time,--and his majesty will be in  the right.\"    \"Excuses,\" murmured De Wardes; \"mere pretexts.\"    \"Really, M. De Wardes,\" resumed Raoul, \"such remarks are the idlest  bluster. You know very well that the Duke of Buckingham is a man of  undoubted courage, who has already fought ten duels, and will probably  fight eleven. His name alone is significant enough. As far as I am  concerned, you are well aware that I can fight also. I fought at Lens,  at Bleneau, at the Dunes in front of the artillery, a hundred paces in  front of the line, while you--I say this parenthetically--were a hundred  paces behind it. True it is, that on that occasion there was far too  great a concourse of persons present for your courage to be observed,  and on that account"]]]
