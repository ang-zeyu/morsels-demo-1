And if so be that the sun is  in the sky, and the snow on the bosom of his Mother Earth, so that his  shadow shall appear on it, he goeth back to sleep again for one and a  half moons more--for six long weeks. But if the sky be dark with clouds  and the earth all bared of snow so that no shadow shows, he says, \"The  blizzard time is over, there is food when the ground is bare,\" and ends  his sleep.    This is the tale and this much I know is true: In the North, if he  venture forth on Woodchuck Day, he sees both sun and snow, so sleeps  again; in the South there is no snow that day, and he sleeps no more;  and in the land between, he sleeps in a cold winter, and in an open  winter rouses to live his life.    These things I have seen, and they fit with the story of Monapini, so  you see the little Rumour told me true.          THINGS TO KNOW    [Illustration: How the Pine Tree Tells Its Own Story]          Things to Know      TALE 60    How the Pine Tree Tells Its Own Story    Suppose you are in the woods, and your woods in Canada, or the Northern  States; you would see at once two kinds of trees: Pines and Hardwoods.    Pines, or Evergreens, have leaves like needles, and are green all the  year round; they bear cones and have soft wood.    The Hardwoods, or Broadleaves, sometimes called Shedders, have broad  leaves that are shed in the fall; they bear nuts or berries and have  hard wood.    Remember this, every tree that grows has flowers and seeds; and the tree  can always be told by its seeds, that is, its fruit. If you find a tree  with cones on it, you know it belongs to the Pine family. If you find  one with broad leaves and nuts or berries, it belongs to the  Hardwoods.[C]    Of these the Pines always seem to me more interesting.           *       *       *       *       *    In September, 1002, I had a good chance to study Pine trees in the  mountains of Idaho. There was a small one that had to be cut down, so I  made careful drawings of it. It was fourteen years old, and across the  stump it showed one ring of wood for each year of growth, and a circle  of branches on the trunk for each year. Notice that between the  branches, the trunk did _not_ taper; it was an even cylinder, but got  suddenly smaller at each knot by the same amount of wood as was needed  by those branches for their wood.    If we begin in the centre of the stump, and at the bottom of the trunk,  we find that the little tree tells us its own story of its life and  troubles. Its first year, judging by the bottom section of the trunk  (No. 1) and by the inmost ring, was just ordinary. Next year according  to section 2 and ring 2, it had a fine season and grew nearly twice as  much as the first year. The third year the baby Pine had a very hard  time, and nearly died. Maybe it was a dry summer, so the little tree  grew only 2-1/2 inches higher while the ring of wood it added was no  thicker than a sheet of paper. Next year, the fourth, it did better. And  the next was about its best year, for it grew 7-1/2 inches higher, and  put on a fine fat ring of wood, as you see.    In its eleventh year, it had some new troubles; either the season was  dry, or the trees about too shady, or maybe disease attacked it. For it  grew but a poor shoot on the top, and the ring of wood on the stump is  about the thinnest of all.    Of course, a saw-cut along the second joint showed but thirteen rings,  and the third but twelve while one through the top joint, the one which  grew this year, showed but a single ring.    Thus the Pine tree has in itself a record of its whole life; and this is  easy to read when the tree is small; but in later life the lower limbs  disappear, and the only complete record is in the rings of growth that  show on the stump. These never fail to tell the truth.    Of course, you are not to go around cutting down trees merely to count  their rings and read their history, but you should look at the rings  whenever a new stump gives you a good chance. Then Hardwoods as well as  Pines will spread before you the chapters of their life; one ring for  each year that they have lived.      TALE 61    Blazes    All hunters and Indians have signs to let their people know the way.  Some of these signs are on trees, and are called \"Blazes.\" One of those  much used is a little piece of bark chipped off to show the white wood;  it means: \"This is the way, or the place.\" Another sign is like an  arrow, and means: \"Over there,\" or \"Go in that direction.\" No matter  what language they speak, the blazes tell everyone alike. So a blaze is  a simple mark that tells us something without using words or letters,  and it depends on where it is placed for part of its meaning.    On the following page are some blazes used in our towns to-day. You will  find many more if you look, some in books; some on the adjoining page.      TALE 62    Totems[D]    [Illustration: BLAZES.]    A Totem is a simple form used as the emblem or symbol of a man, a group  of men, an animal, or an idea; it does not use or refer to words or  letters, so it is the same in all languages. Unlike the blaze it does  not depend on its position for part of its meaning.    [Illustration: Some well known TOTEMS]    Among peoples that cannot read or write, each leading man had a Totem  that he used, instead of writing his name. He put this mark on his  property, and at length put it on his shield and armour to distinguish  him in battle. Out of this grew heraldry.    [Illustration: Indian Symbols]    Modern trade-marks are Totems though often spoiled by words or letters  added. The Totem continues in use because it is so easy to see a long  way off, and can be understood by all, no matter what their language.  Most of the great railway companies have a Totem and the use of such  things is increasing to-day.    Here in the drawing are some Totems seen daily in our towns. Doubtless  you can add to the number.      TALE 63    Symbols    If you have thought much about it, O Guide! you will surely find that,  for decoration, it is better to use a beautiful symbol of anything,  rather than a good photograph of it. For the symbol lets the imagination  loose, and the other chains it to the ground; the one is the spirit, and  the other the corpse. These things you cannot tell to the little folks,  but you can prove them to yourself, and you will see why I wish to give  some symbols here for use.    There is another reason, one which you _can_ give to them. It is this:  Only the highly trained artist can make a good portrait drawing, while  the smallest child, if it sticks to symbols, is sure, in some degree, of  a pleasant success in its very first effort.    These that I give, are copied from Indian art, and whether in colour, in  raised modelling, or in black lines, can be used successfully to  decorate anything that you are likely to make.    [Illustration: Seventeen Gestures Currently Used in the Sign Language]      TALE 64    Sign Language    All men, especially wild men, and some animals have a language of signs.  That is, they talk to each other without making any sounds; using  instead, the movements of parts of the body. This is \"eye talk,\" while  words are \"ear talk.\"    Among the animals, horses bob their heads when they are hungry and paw  with a front foot when thirsty or eager to be off. Dogs wag their tails  when pleased, and cows shake their heads when angry.    Policemen, firemen, railway men, and others use signs because there is  too much noise to be heard. School children use signs because they are  not allowed to talk in school. Most children know the signs for \"yes\"  and \"no,\" \"come here,\" \"go away,\" \"hurry up,\" \"you can't touch me,\"  \"hush!\", \"shame on you!\", \"up,\" \"down,\" \"word of honour,\" \"swimming,\"  etc.    The traffic policeman is using signs all day long. By a movement of the  hand he signals:--stop, go on, come here, hurry up, wait, turn around,  go by, stay back, over there, you look out, right here, and one or two  others.    How many signs can you add to these two lists?      TALE 65    The Language of Hens    Yes; Hens talk somewhat as we do; only they haven't so many words, and  don't depend on them as we have to.    There are only ten words in ordinary hen-talk.    The _cluck, cluck_ of the mother means \"Come along, kiddies.\"    The low _kawk_ of warning, usually for a hawk.    The _chuck, chuck_ of invitation means, \"Good food.\"    The _tuk-ut-e-ah-tuk_ means, \"Bless my soul, what is that?\"    The _cut, cut, get your hair cut_, of a Hen that has just laid and is  feeling greatly relieved; no doubt, saying, \"Thank goodness, that's  done!\" or maybe it is a notice to her mate or friend that \"Business is  over, let's have some fun. Where are you?\"    The soft, long-drawn _tawk--tawk--tawk_, that is uttered as the Hen  strolls about, corresponds to the whistling of the small boy; that is,  it is a mere pastime, expressing freedom from fear or annoyance.    The long, harsh, _crauk, crauk_ of fear when captured.    The quick _clack, clack, clatter_ when springing up in fear of capture.    The _put, put_ of hunger.    And, of course, the _peep, peep_ of chickens and the  _cock-a-doodle-doo_, which is the song of the Rooster.    Some Hens may have more; but these given here are hen-talk for  mother-love, warning, invitation, surprise, exultation, cheerfulness,  fear, astonishment, and hunger. Not a bad beginning in the way of  language.      TALE 66    Why the Squirrel Wears a Bushy Tail    \"Oh, Mother, look at that Gray Squirrel!\" shouted Billie. \"What a  beautiful bushy tail he has!\" Then, after a pause he added, \"Mother,  what is its tail for? Why is it so big and fluffy? I know a 'Possum has  a tail to hang on a limb with, and a Fish can swim with his tail, but  why is a Gray Squirrel's tail so bushy and soft?\"    Alas! Mother didn't know, and couldn't tell where to find out. It was  long after, that little Billie got the answer to his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23668"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Salisbury (#18)"],[1," and with the precedent of Price's report,  declared the chapels unsafe, and also, which was no doubt his real  motive for action, that \"their lack of uniformity\" injured the  appearance of the buildings. Wyatt's ideal virtues were of the lowest  order, to obtain neatness and tidiness he was prepared to sacrifice  any and every thing, and the two chapels were obviously not in the  style of the cathedral, nor, unluckily (for had they been they might  yet be standing), precisely symmetrical in effect, so they were swept  away. These actions at Salisbury, and similar destruction at Lincoln,  Hereford, and elsewhere, have made Wyatt's name odious; but deserving  though he be of all blame, it must not be forgotten that restorers of  to-day, even at Salisbury, have effaced much interesting work of past  time on the same pretext: that it failed to accord with the rest of  the work to which it was obviously a late addition. This plea,  specious and even excellent in theory, has probably done more  irreparable injury to our ancient buildings than even the iconoclasts  of the Reformation. A shattered ruin may convey a clear idea of its  original state, while a smooth, pedantic restoration will obliterate  it entirely.    =The Stained Glass= throughout the whole building survives but in a  few instances, and these, with two exceptions, not in their original  places. Of its wholesale destruction we have sad evidence extant in a  letter, dated 1788, from John Berry, glazier, of Salisbury, to Mr.  Lloyd, of Conduit Street, London. It may be transcribed in full, to  show how reckless the custodians of the fabric were at that  time:--\"Sir. This day I have sent you a Box full of old Stained &  Painted glass, as you desired me to due, which I hope will sute your  Purpos, it his the best that I can get at Present. But I expect to  Beate to Peceais a a great deal very sune, as it his of now use to  me, and we do it for the lead. If you want more of the same sorts you  may have what thear is, if it will pay for taking out, as it is a Deal  of Truble to what Beating it to Peceais his; you will send me a line  as soon as Possoble, for we are goain to move our glasing shop to a  Nother plase, and thin we hope to save a great deal more of the like  sort, which I ham your most Omble servant--John Berry.\"       [Illustration: PORTIONS OF THE OLD STAINED GLASS.]    The fragments that survived were collected some fifty years since, and  placed in the nave windows, and in parts of some of the others. The  most important are in the great west triple lancet, wherein the glass  ranges in date from the twelfth to the fifteenth century. Mr. Winston,  in his Paper read in 1849 before the Archaeological Institute and  printed in the Salisbury volume for that year, considered that the  earliest fragments are from a Stem of Jesse about 1240, and some  medallions about 1270. He describes two of the ovals that are on each  side of the throned bishop, a prominent figure in the lower half of  the central light, one of the Christ enthroned, the other of the  Virgin. The two medallions below them he believes represent \"Zacharias  in the Temple,\" and \"The Adoration of the Magi.\" The later glass now  in the same window may be either Flemish work brought hither from  Dijon, or possibly partly from Rouen, and partly from a church near  Exeter. It has been conjectured that in the south lancet the figures  represent SS. Peter and Francis, in the central one the Crucifixion,  the Coronation of the Virgin, and the Invention of the Cross, and in  the north light the Betrayal of Christ and St. Catherine. In two of  the side windows of the nave are the arms of John Aprice (1555-1558)  and Bishop Jewell (1562).    The stained glass in the north choir aisle includes a window executed  by Messrs. Clayton and Bell, in memory of Archdeacon Huxtable, with  figures of archangels and angels in the upper lights, and the Angel  appearing to Gideon, and the Vision of Isaiah, in the lower panels.  Also a window by Clayton and Bell to the memory of the wife of the  Rev. Chancellor Swayne, having for its subject the reply of our Lord  to his disciples. In the east side of the Morning Chapel is a window  by Messrs. Burleson and Gryles to the memory of Mrs. W.R. Hamilton,  with the Nativity, Crucifixion, Resurrection, and the three  archangels, Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael.    In the south choir aisle are two Clayton and Bell windows, to the  memory of George Morrison, and two others excellently treated, both  designed by Holiday, and executed by Powell. In the one eight panels  represent four holy women of the Old Testament, and the four Maries.  This is to the memory of the late Countess of Radnor. In the other, to  the memory of Jacob, the 4th Earl of Radnor, a similar screen of  decoration embodies figures of eight prophets.    In the south-east transept is a window erected to the officers of the  Wiltshire Regiment who fell in the Sutlej Campaign in 1845-6, and in  the Crimean War of 1854-5; also one of \"The Raising of Lazarus.\" In  the upper windows of this transept is a quantity of old glass of  different dates, which had been stored away for over a century in the  roof of the Lady Chapel, until lately collected and placed where it  now is.    The south choir aisle has a window in memory of the late Duke of  Albany, \"Jacob's Dream,\" and two of the intended six windows of a  hierarchy of angels--the Angeli Ministrantes and the Angeli  Laudantes--designed by Sir E. Burne-Jones, and executed by William  Morris, which are notably among the most superb examples of the art of  glass painting since mediaeval times. Next in order towards the east is  a window of fine design to the memory of the late Duke of Albany.    In the south-west transept there are three Clayton and Bell windows:  in memory of Archdeacon Macdonald, with three subjects from the Life  of Christ; in memory of Bishop Douglas, and in memory of C.G.  Verrinder; also one to the memory of Sir G.A. Arney, with Moses and  the Tables of the Law, and the Sermon on the Mount; and the large  south window, by Bell, to the memory of Dean Hamilton.    Above the altar is a fine light window of last century work,  singularly good of its kind--bad though the kind may be.    In the south aisle of the nave is a window to the memory of Mr. W.M.  Coates, with subjects, the miracles of healing, executed by Messrs.  Clayton and Bell.    In 1890 a fine modern window, from a design by Henry Holiday, was  inserted in the south aisle of the nave. This has for its subject,  \"Suffer little children to come unto me.\" It is to the memory of John  Henry Jacob and his wife.    In 1620 Dr. Simpson mentions \"three great windows newly glazed in rich  colours to make the story of St. Paul.\"    Throughout the cathedral, and in the Chapter House, were many  specimens of geometrical painted glass, some of which are figured in  Mr. Winston's Paper, before referred to. These have served as motives  for much modern design, which, faithfully as it may have copied the  forms, has generally missed the softened colour that distinguishes the  original work.       [Illustration: TOMB OF WILLIAM LONGESPEE, 1ST EARL OF SALISBURY     (P. 47).     _From a Photograph by Catherine Weed Ward._]          HISTORY OF THE SEE.      The site of old Sarum--Searobyrig, the dry city, as the Saxons called  it--is about a mile to the north of the present New Sarum, or  Salisbury, to use the more familiar name. It was probably a fortified  place from very early times, long before it became the Roman station  of Sorbiodunum. William of Malmesbury says that \"the town was more  like a castle than a city, being environed with a high wall, and  notwithstanding that it was very well accommodated with other  conveniences, yet such was the want of water that it sold at a great  rate.\" This latter statement, although repeated by every chronicler,  is not supported by investigations of recent explorers, who found an  ample supply in divers wells. Francis Price concludes that \"it was  frequented by Roman Emperors from the coins of Constantine, Constans  Magnentius, Crispus, and Claudius, being found frequently among its  ruins.\" This statement also lacks probability. A legend of the visit  of a single emperor might have been barely credible; but the lavish  variety the otherwise trustworthy historian offers is fatal to one's  belief. Its early history, more or less legendary, need not be  chronicled here. Probably Kenric the Saxon, who captured it in 553,  lived there, and it seems to have been kept in his line until Egbert  united the whole Heptarchy. King Alfred ordered Leofric, Earl of  Wiltunscire, to add to its fortifications, which appear to have fallen  into decay after the Romans held it. In 1003 Svein, King of Denmark,  pillaged and burnt it, but the religious establishments if not spared  were soon re-established, for we find that Editha, Queen of AEdward  the Confessor, conveyed the lands of Shorstan to the nuns of St. Mary,  Sarum. At this time it appears to have possessed a mint, as a coin of  AEdward the Confessor bears an inscription showing that it was struck  by Godred at Sarum.    From the time of St. Aldhelm, in 705, to that of Herman, in 1058,  there are no other facts of its secular history sufficiently pertinent  to our purpose to warrant their quotation here, as the record of the  place is so woven into the lives of its bishops, that the brief  summary of the ecclesiastics who held the see includes all we need of  the history of the city. In this kingdom within a kingdom, a cathedral  surrounded by a fortress, its inhabitants were naturally split into  factions; the soldiers and the clergy failed to agree, and in spite of  the document quoted below, there is little doubt that political rather  than climatic reasons led to the removal of the cathedral. Whether, as  some writers think, it was but an insignificant structure, it is  certainly recorded that the church "]]]
