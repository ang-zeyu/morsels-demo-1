From 1560 to 1574 he was a poet of the court and of courtly occasions,  an eloquent declaimer on public events in the _Discours des Miseres  de ce Temps_, and the unfortunate epic poet of his unfinished  _Franciade_. During the last ten years of his life he gave freer  expression to his personal feelings, his sadness, his gladness; and  to these years belong the admirable sonnets to Helene de Surgeres,  his autumnal love.    [Footnote 1: _i.e._ the Anacreontic poems, found, and published in  1554, by Henri Estienne.]    Ronsard's genius was lyrical and elegiac, but the tendencies of a  time when the great affair was the organisation of social life, and  as a consequence the limitation of individual and personal passions,  were not favourable to the development of lyrical poetry. In his  imitations of Pindar a narrative element checks the flight of song,  and there is a certain unreality in the premeditated attempt to  reproduce the passionate fluctuations and supposed disorder of his  model. The study of Pindar, however, trained Ronsard in the handling  of sustained periods of verse, and interested him in complex lyrical  combinations. His Anacreontic and Horatian odes are far happier;  among these some of his most delightful work is found. If he was  deficient in great ideas, he had delicacy of sentiment and an  exquisite sense of metrical harmony. The power which he possessed  as a narrative poet appears best in episodes or epic fragments. His  ambitious attempt to trace the origin of the French monarchy from  the imaginary Trojan Francus was unfortunate in its subject, and  equally unfortunate in its form--the rhyming decasyllabic verse.    In pieces which may be called hortatory, the pulpit eloquence, as  it were, of a poet addressing his contemporaries on public matters,  the utterances of a patriot and a citizen moved by pity for his fellows,  such poetry as the _Discours des Miseres de ce Temps_ and the  _Institution pour l'Adolescence du Roi, Charles IX._, Ronsard is  original and impressive, a forerunner of the orator poets of the  seventeenth century. His eclogues show a true feeling for external  nature, touched at times by a tender sadness. When he escapes from  the curiosities and the strain of his less happy Petrarchism, he is  an admirable poet of love in song and sonnet; no more beautiful  variation on the theme of \"gather the rosebuds while ye may\" exists  than his sonnet _Quand vous serez bien vieille_, unless it be his  dainty ode _Mignonne, allons voir si la Rose_. Passionate in the  deepest and largest sense Ronsard is not; but it was much to be sincere  and tender, to observe just measure, to render a subtle phase of  emotion. In the fine melancholy of his elegiac poetry he is almost  modern. Before all else he is a master of his instrument, an inventor  of new effects and movements of the lyre; in his hands the entire  rhythmical system was renewed or was purified. His dexterity in  various metres was that of a great virtuoso, and it was not the mere  dexterity which conquers difficulties, it was a skill inspired and  sustained by the sentiment of metre.    Of the other members of the Pleiade, one--Jodelle--is remembered  chiefly in connection with the history of the drama. Baif (1532-89),  son of the French ambassador at Venice, translated from Sophocles  and Terence, imitated Plautus, Petrarchised in sonnets, took from  Virgil's Georgics the inspiration of his _Meteores_, was guided by  the Anacreontic poems in his _Passe-Temps_, and would fain rival  Theognis in his most original work _Les Mimes_, where a moral or  satiric meaning masks behind an allegory or a fable. He desired to  connect poetry more closely with music, and with this end in view  thought to reform the spelling of words and to revive the quantitative  metrical system of classical verse.[2] REMI BELLEAU (1528-77)  practised the Horatian ode and the sonnet; translated Anacreon;  followed the Neapolitan Sannazaro in his _Bergerie_ of connected  prose and verse, where the shepherds are persons of distinction  arrayed in a pastoral disguise; and adapted the mediaeval _lapidary_  (with imitations of the pseudo-Orpheus) to the taste of the  Renaissance in his _Amours et Nouveaux Eschanges des Pierres  Precieuses_. These little myths and metamorphoses of gems are  ingenious and graceful. The delicate feeling for nature which Belleau  possessed is seen at its best in the charming song _Avril_, included  in his somewhat incoherent _Bergerie_. Among his papers was found,  after his death, a comedy, _La Reconnue_, which, if it has little  dramatic power, shows a certain instinct for satire.    [Footnote 2: The \"Baifin verse,\" French not classical, is of fifteen  syllables, divided into hemistichs of seven and eight syllables.]    These are minor lights in the poetical constellation; but the star  of JOACHIM DU BELLAY shines with a ray which, if less brilliant than  that of Ronsard, has a finer and more penetrating influence. Du Bellay  was born about 1525, at Lire, near Angers, of an illustrious family.  His youth was unhappy, and a plaintive melancholy haunts his verse.  Like Ronsard he suffered from deafness, and he has humorously sung  its praises. _Olive_, fifty sonnets in honour of his Platonic or  Petrarchan mistress, Mlle. de Viole (the letters of whose name are  transposed to Olive), appeared almost at the same moment as the  earliest _Odes_ of Ronsard; but before long he could mock in sprightly  stanzas the fantasies and excesses of the Petrarchan style. It was  not until his residence in Rome (1551) as intendant of his cousin  Cardinal du Bellay, the French ambassador, that he found his real  self. In his _Antiquites de Rome_ he expresses the sentiment of ruins,  the pathos of fallen greatness, as it had never been expressed before.  The intrigues, corruption, and cynicism of Roman society, his broken  health, an unfortunate passion for the Faustina of his Latin verses,  and the longing for his beloved province and little Lire depressed  his spirits; in the sonnets of his _Regrets_ he embodied his intimate  feelings, and that lively spirit of satire which the baseness of the  Pontifical court summoned into life. This satiric vein had, indeed,  already shown itself in his mocking counsel to _le Poete courtisan_:  the courtier poet is to be a gentleman who writes at ease; he is not  to trouble himself with study of the ancients; he is to produce only  pieces of occasion, and these in a negligent style; the rarer and  the smaller they are the better; and happily at last he may cease  to bring forth even these. Possibly his _poete courtisan_ was Melin  de Saint-Gelais. As a rural poet Du Bellay is charming; his _Jeux  Rustiques_, while owing much to the _Lusus_ of the Venetian poet  Navagero, have in them the true breath of the fields; it is his _douce_  province of Anjou which inspires him; the song to _Venus_ in its  happiest stanzas is only less admirable than the _Vanneur de Ble_,  with which more than any other single poem the memory of Du Bellay  is associated. The personal note, which is in general absent from  the poetry of Ronsard, is poignantly and exquisitely audible in the  best pieces of Du Bellay. He did not live long enough to witness the  complete triumph of the master; in 1560 he died exhausted, at the  age of thirty-five.    The Pleiade served literature by their attention to form, by their  skill in poetic instrumentation; but they were incapable of  interpreting life in any large and original way. In the hands of their  successors poetry languished for want of an inspiring theme. PHILIPPE  DESPORTES (1546-1606) was copious and skilful in his reproduction  and imitation of Italian models; as a courtier poet he reduced  literary flattery to a fine art; but his mannered graces are cold,  his pretence of passion is a laboured kind of _esprit_. A copy of  his works annotated by the hand of Malherbe survives; the comments,  severe and just, remained unpublished, probably because the writer  was unwilling to pursue an adversary whom death had removed from his  way. Jean Bertaut, his disciple, is a lesser Desportes. Satire was  developed by Jean Vauquelin de la Fresnaye, and to him we owe an _Art  Poetique_ (1575) which adapts to his own time the teaching of  Aristotle and Horace. More interesting than these is JEAN PASSERAT  (1534-1602), whose spirit is that of old France in its mirth and  mockery, and whose more serious verse has the patriotism of French  citizenship; his field was small, but he tilled his field gaily and  courageously. The villanelle _J'ai perdu ma tourterelle_ and the ode  on May-day show Passerat's art in its happiest moments.    The way for a reform in dramatic poetry had been in some degree  prepared by plays of the sixteenth century, written in Latin--the  work of Buchanan, Muret, and others--by translations from Terence,  Sophocles, Euripides, translations from Italian comedy, and  renderings of one Spanish model, the highly-popular _Celestina_ of  Fernando de Rojas. The Latin plays were acted in schools. The first  performance of a play in French belonging to the new tendency was  that of Ronsard's translation of the Plutus of Aristophanes, in 1549,  by his friends of the College de Coqueret. It was only by amateurs,  and before a limited scholarly group of spectators, that the new  classical tragedies could be presented. Gradually both tragedy and  comedy came to be written solely with a view to publication in print.  The mediaeval drama still held the stage.    JODELLE'S _Cleopatre_ (1552), performed with enthusiasm by amateurs,  was therefore a false start; it was essentially literary, and not  theatrical. Greek models were crudely imitated, with a lack of almost  everything that gave life and charm to the Greek drama. Seneca was  more accessible than Sophocles, and his faults were easy to  imitate--his moralisings, his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24708"],[0,"The Biology, Physiology and Sociology of Reproduction (#18)"],[1,"influence of the woman can in  some way compensate for the vital fluid contributed by the male. It  is hardly likely that such a reciprocal influence is other than  psychical, but that is certainly sufficient to account for any  difference in these two forms of sexual gratification.    Nature calls upon the male animal to make a contribution for  procreation, which contribution is, always has been, and, in the very  nature of the case, always must be a certain tax upon the powers of  the male animal. When the intercourse is indulged for procreation  only, the male animal can well afford to make the contribution. Even  with that, the contribution which the male makes to procreation is  incomparably less depleting for him than are the contributions which  the female makes for her.    11. _Will vital fluid flow with every sexual intercourse?_    If vital fluid is present, and if the sexual intercourse is carried to  the point of causing an orgasm, there would, in all normal conditions,  be an emission of semen or \"vital fluid.\"    12. _Is there any way to regulate intercourse so as to control the sex  of the offspring?_    While there are many theories upon this subject no one of them is  generally accepted by medical men.    13. _Will an intense and continuous desire on the part of a young man  for sexual intercourse cause a loss of seminal fluid?_    An intense and continuous desire for sexual intercourse will, without  question, cause an active secretion on the part of the testes, an  increased secretion on the part of the seminal vesicles and an active  secretion on the part of the prostate gland and of Cowper's glands.  The secretion from Cowper's glands will make its way along the urethra  and appear at the opening of that duct, probably soiling the linen of  the subject. The accumulated semen from the other glands will tend  rather to aggravate than allay the sexual desires. Such a condition of  the sexual apparatus is likely to cause a nocturnal emission,  relieving this tension and emptying the gorged gland ducts. If the  nocturnal emission does not occur, the sexual desires are certain to  return to occupy the waking hours more or less completely. If the  nocturnal emission does occur, it will carry away not alone the  vesicular secretion, but also more or less of the nascent spermatozoa  and other constituents of the vital fluid. Seasons of intense and  prolonged sexual excitement are in a high degree inimical to  continence, and even though the subject does not fully submit to his  inclination, his nocturnal emissions, which are likely to come  frequently, carry away the product of the testicular secretion,  thereby depleting to a certain extent, his virility. It is hardly  necessary to urge the importance of resisting these onslaughts of  sexual passion in their very incipiency.    14. _How may the habit of masturbation best be brought under  control?_    The first thing to accomplish is the purification of the thoughts. The  most effective way to purify the thoughts is to divert them to a pure  and strictly non-sexual subject--e.g., _pure mathematics_. The young  man who is trying to break this habit will do well to follow very  closely the rather strenuous regime outlined under hygiene in the body  of the book. If his condition is complicated because of the presence  of a very long loose foreskin, he will be wise to have this removed by  the simple operation of _circumcision_. If he should awake in the  night and feel the temptation to resort to his old habit, he should  resist the temptation in its first stage and instantly put his mind on  some subject quite foreign to his sexual apparatus. If he does not  succeed by force of will in diverting his mind from himself, the best  thing to do is to arise, dress and walk. If walking will not do it let  him run, and keep moving in the open air, under God's blue sky until  he is so tired he can hardly put one foot before the other. Then if he  will retire to his room, he will probably have no further difficulty  at that time.    15. _What influence has dancing upon the young man's solution of his  sexual problems?_    It hardly seems possible that a virile, husky young man, in his early  twenties, could be subjected for several hours to the conditions of  the modern dance hall, where he is brought into very close physical  contact with young women, dressed to expose their secondary sexual  features, perfumed to excite in a man his hereditary sexual  instincts; held so close to his partner in the round dance that he is  conscious of every movement of her limbs, and all of these under the  influence of artificial light and music--I say, it is hardly possible  for a virile young man to be subjected to all these conditions without  experiencing an extreme sexual excitement. That such an experience  often repeated not only does not simplify the young man's problem, but  seriously complicates it is not a matter of doubt on the part of  anyone who has studied these problems. All specialists in this field,  without a single exception, concur in the belief that the dance is a  device of the devil so far as the young man is concerned. That the  young women are, for the most part, quite innocent of the effect of  all these conditions upon their young men friends is also believed by  those who have studied the problem. If they were conscious of it, a  large majority of them would not longer consent to be the party to  such unfortunate conditions. The Square Dance, the Virginia Reel and  similar dances of the times of our grandparents are not remotely to be  compared in this matter with the modern Round Dance.    16. _May lost Virility be regained by use of \"Remedies\" or medicines  of any kind?_    No. Positively and absolutely, _No_. Many such nostrums are advertised  in the public prints. Many are sold by charlatans and quacks. No  reputable physician would hold out to his patient the hope that any  drug could bring back lost manhood.    _Lost manhood or lost virility may be regained by right living only._  The prescription for right living is as follows: _Live a continent  life_ and follow _a strenuous and sane regime of personal hygiene_,  such as outlined in chapter V above.    17. _Is the production of semen modified by nutrition?_    The production of semen is greatly modified by the state of nutrition.  Remember in this connection that semen is partly from the testes  (Spermatozoa) and partly from the vesicles and prostate. The formation  and release of spermatozoa is only slightly modified by the condition  of nutrition; while the rate of secretion from the vesicles is greatly  modified in quantity. This accounts for the fact that well nourished  men who eat heavily are very likely to experience frequent nocturnal  emissions, when living continently.            LECTURES    by the    Author of Reproduction and Sexual Hygiene.      THE YOUNG MAN'S PROBLEM.      Heard by 20,000 men last year.      WHAT IS SAID ABOUT IT.      The Young Men's Christian Association of Philadelphia.  Walter M. Wood, General Secretary                                               October 17, 1908.  To Whom it May Concern:        It is with great pleasure that I pay a tribute of appreciation      to the excellent service of Dr. Winfield S. Hall, in his      presentation to audiences of young men of the vital problems of      sexual hygiene.        With the intelligence of a trained and experienced physician,      with the thoroughness and frankness of an expert teacher and      with the delicacy and motive of a Christian gentleman, he      presents the \"Young Man's Problem\" in such a way as to make him,      in my judgment, one of the most helpful counselors of young men      on the American platform today.                                                 Sincerely,                                                   W.M. WOOD.      University of Notre Dame.    Winfield Scott Hall, M.D.,  Northwestern University Medical School.    My Dear Dr. Hall:        In your lecture on \"The Young Man's Problem\" and in your book on      \"Sexual Hygiene\" you are doing a great service for the rising      generation. I am convinced that one great source of vice is      ignorance about the matters touched upon in your lecture and      book. Priests are constantly giving instruction on these same      points, but it is a distinct advantage to have their teaching      reinforced by a distinguished physician, expressing himself with      the plainness of the laity and speaking always in a most      reverential spirit. For students seventeen years of age or more      your presentation of this difficult subject will be a God-send,      for it abates curiosity, dissipates ignorance, warns of perils      and arouses a manly desire for a clean life.                                 Very sincerely yours,                                      JOHN CAVANAUGH, C.S.C.,                                                    President.      Central Department, Young Men's Christian Association, Chicago.                                               October 21, 1908.    Dr. Winfield S. Hall, Northwestern University Medical School.  My Dear Dr. Hall:        Our committee wants to know if we cannot arrange a date with you      this year to deliver your lecture on \"The Young Man's Problem.\"      I also want some more of your books on Reproduction and Sexual      Hygiene.        I cannot forbear to express my very hearty appreciation of the      splendid service you have done and are doing to the young      manhood of our country in this lecture and this book. I have      never heard a presentation of the subject which takes hold so      deeply upon thoughtful men, and your book is by all odds the      best thing in print on this subject. Your scientific, yet      popular method and the absence of vague moralizing are      convincing and inspiring in their effects. I trust we may hear      you this year.             "]]]
