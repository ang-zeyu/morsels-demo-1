The risk is stupendous. It cost Galileo, what? This  awful price: the temporary loss of his self-respect. His  fear overcame his loyalty; the courage of his convictions  fell before it. Fear is the weapon in the hands of [10]  tyrants.    Men and women of the nineteenth century, are you  called to voice a higher order of Science? Then obey  this call. Go, if you must, to the dungeon or the scaf-  fold, but take not back the words of Truth. How many [15]  are there ready to suffer for a righteous cause, to stand  a long siege, take the front rank, face the foe, and be  in the battle every day?    In no other one thing seemed Jesus of Nazareth more  divine than in his faith in the immortality of his words. [20]  He said, \"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my  words shall not pass away;\" and they have not. The  winds of time sweep clean the centuries, but they can  never bear into oblivion his words. They still live, and  to-morrow speak louder than to-day. They are to-day [25]  as the voice of one crying in the wilderness, \"Make  straight God's paths; make way for health, holiness,  universal harmony, and come up hither.\" The gran-  deur of the word, the power of Truth, is again casting  out evils and healing the sick; and it is whispered, \"This [30]  is Science.\"    Jesus taught by the wayside, in humble homes. He    [Page 100.]    spake of Truth and Love to artless listeners and dull [1]  disciples. His immortal words were articulated in a  decaying language, and then left to the providence of  God. Christian Science was to interpret them; and  woman, \"last at the cross,\" was to awaken the dull senses, [5]  intoxicated with pleasure or pain, to the infinite meaning  of those words.    Past, present, future, will show the word and might of  Truth--healing the sick and reclaiming the sinner--  so long as there remains a claim of error for Truth to [10]  deny or to destroy. Love's labors are not lost. The  five personal senses, that grasp neither the meaning nor  the magnitude of self-abnegation, may lose sight thereof;  but Science voices unselfish love, unfolds infinite good,  leads on irresistible forces, and will finally show the fruits [15]  of Love. Human reason is inaccurate; and the scope  of the senses is inadequate to grasp the word of Truth,  and teach the eternal.    Science speaks when the senses are silent, and then  the evermore of Truth is triumphant. The spiritual mon- [20]  itor understood is coincidence of the divine with the  human, the acme of Christian Science. Pure humanity,  friendship, home, the interchange of love, bring to earth  a foretaste of heaven. They unite terrestrial and celes-  tial joys, and crown them with blessings infinite. [25]    The Christian Scientist loves man more because he  loves God most. He understands this Principle,--Love.  Who is sufficient for these things? Who remembers that  patience, forgiveness, abiding faith, and affection, are  the symptoms by which our Father indicates the dif- [30]  ferent stages of man's recovery from sin and his en-  trance into Science? Who knows how the feeble lips    [Page 101.]    are made eloquent, how hearts are inspired, how heal- [1]  ing becomes spontaneous, and how the divine Mind is  understood and demonstrated? He alone knows these  wonders who is departing from the thraldom of the  senses and accepting spiritual truth,--that which blesses [5]  its adoption by the refinement of joy and the dismissal of  sorrow.    Christian Science and the senses are at war. It is a  revolutionary struggle. We already have had two in  this nation; and they began and ended in a contest for [10]  the true idea, for human liberty and rights. Now cometh  a third struggle; for the freedom of health, holiness, and  the attainment of heaven.    The scientific sense of being which establishes har-  mony, enters into no compromise with finiteness and [15]  feebleness. It undermines the foundations of mortality,  of physical law, breaks their chains, and sets the captive  free, opening the doors for them that are bound.    He who turns to the body for evidence, bases his con-  clusions on mortality, on imperfection; but Science saith  to man, \"God hath all-power.\" [20]    The Science of omnipotence demonstrates but one  power, and this power is good, not evil; not matter,  but Mind. This virtually destroys matter and evil, in-  cluding sin and disease. [25]    If God is All, and God is good, it follows that all  must be good; and no other power, law, or intelligence  can exist. On this proof rest premise and conclusion in  Science, and the facts that disprove the evidence of the  senses. [30]    God is individual Mind. This one Mind and His  individuality comprise the elements of all forms and    [Page 102.]    individualities, and prophesy the nature and stature of [1]  Christ, the ideal man.    A corporeal God, as often defined by lexicographers  and scholastic theologians, is only an infinite finite being,  an unlimited man,--a theory to me inconceivable. If [5]  the unlimited and immortal Mind could originate in a  limited body, Mind would be chained to finity, and the  infinite forever finite.    In this limited and lower sense God is not personal.  His infinity precludes the possibility of corporeal person- [10]  ality. His being is individual, but not physical.    God is like Himself and like nothing else. He is uni-  versal and primitive. His character admits of no degrees  of comparison. God is not part, but the whole. In His  individuality I recognize the loving, divine Father-Mother [15]  God. Infinite personality must be incorporeal.    God's ways are not ours. His pity is expressed in  modes above the human. His chastisements are the  manifestations of Love. The sympathy of His eternal  Mind is fully expressed in divine Science, which blots [20]  out all our iniquities and heals all our diseases. Human  pity often brings pain.    Science supports harmony, denies suffering, and de-  stroys it with the divinity of Truth. Whatever seems mate-  rial, seems thus only to the material senses, and is but the [25]  subjective state of mortal and material thought.    Science has inaugurated the irrepressible conflict be-  tween sense and Soul. Mortal thought wars with this  sense as one that beateth the air, but Science outmasters  it, and ends the warfare. This proves daily that \"one [30]  on God's side is a majority.\"    Science defines _omnipresence_ as universality, that which    [Page 103.]    precludes the presence of evil. This verity annuls the tes- [1]  timony of the senses, which say that sin is an evil power,  and substance is perishable. Intelligent Spirit, Soul, is  substance, far more impregnable and solid than matter; for  one is temporal, while the other is eternal, the ultimate [5]  and predicate of being.    Mortality, materiality, and destructive forces, such as  sin, disease, and death, mortals virtually name _substance_;  but these are the substance of things _not_ hoped for. For  lack of knowing what substance is, the senses say vaguely: [10]  \"The substance of life is sorrow and mortality; for who  knoweth the substance of good?\" In Science, form and  individuality are never lost, thoughts are outlined, indi-  vidualized ideas, which dwell forever in the divine Mind  as tangible, true substance, because eternally conscious. [15]  Unlike mortal mind, which must be ever in bondage,  the eternal Mind is free, unlimited, and knows not the  temporal.    Neither does the temporal know the eternal. Mortal  man, as mind or matter, is neither the pattern nor Maker [20]  of immortal man. Any inference of the divine derived  from the human, either as mind or body, hides the actual  power, presence, and individuality of God.    Jesus' personality in the flesh, so far as material sense  could discern it, was like that of other men; but Science [25]  exchanges this human concept of Jesus for the divine  ideal, his spiritual individuality that reflected the Im-  manuel, or \"God with us.\" This God was not outlined.  He was too mighty for that. He was eternal Life, infinite  Truth and Love. The individuality is embraced in Mind, [30]  therefore is forever with the Father. Hence the Scrip-  ture, \"I am a God at hand, saith the Lord.\" Even while    [Page 104.]    his personality was on earth and in anguish, his individual [1]  being, the Christ, was at rest in the eternal harmony.  His unseen individuality, so superior to that which was  seen, was not subject to the temptations of the flesh, to  laws material, to death, or the grave. Formed and gov- [5]  erned by God, this individuality was safe in the substance  of Soul, the substance of Spirit,--yea, the substance of  God, the one inclusive good.    In Science all being is individual; for individuality is  endless in the calculus of forms and numbers. Herein [10]  sin is miraculous and supernatural; for it is not in the  nature of God, and good is forever good. Accord-  ing to Christian Science, perfection is normal,--not  miraculous. Clothed, and in its right Mind, man's  individuality is sinless, deathless, harmonious, eternal. [15]  His materiality, clad in a false mentality, wages feeble  fight with his individuality,--his physical senses with  his spiritual senses. The latter move in God's grooves  of Science: the former revolve in their own orbits, and  must stand the friction of false selfhood until self- [20]  destroyed.    In obedience to the divine nature, man's individuality  reflects the divine law and order of being. How shall  we reach our true selves? Through Love. The Prin-  ciple of Christian Science is Love, and its idea represents [25]  Love. This divine Principle and idea are demonstrated,  in healing, to be God and the real man.    Who wants to be mortal, or would not gain the true  ideal of Life and recover his own individuality?

Scot had been a  voice crying in the wilderness. Harsnett was supported by the powers in  church and state. He was, as has been seen, the chaplain of Bishop  Bancroft,[38] now--from 1604--to become Archbishop of Canterbury. He was  himself to become eminent in English history as master of Pembroke Hall  (Cambridge), vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, Bishop of  Chichester, Bishop of Norwich, and Archbishop of York.[39] Whatever  support he had at the time--and it is very clear that he had the backing  of the English church on the question of exorcism--his later position  and influence must have given great weight not only to his views on  exorcism but to his skepticism about witchcraft.[40]    His opinions on the subject, so far as can be judged by his few direct  statements and by implications, were quite as radical as those of his  predecessor.[41] As a matter of fact he was a man who read widely[42]  and had pondered deeply on the superstition, but his thought had been  colored by Scot.[43] His assault, however, was less direct and studied  than that of his master. Scot was a man of uncommonly serious  temperament, a plain, blunt-spoken, church-going Englishman who covered  the whole ground of superstition without turning one phrase less serious  than another. His pupil, if so Harsnett may be called, wrote earnestly,  even aggressively, but with a sarcastic and bitter humor that  entertained the reader and was much less likely to convince. The curl  never left his lips. If at times a smile appeared, it was but an  accented sneer. A writer with a feeling indeed for the delicate effects  of word combination, if his humor had been less chilled by hate, if his  wit had been of a lighter and more playful vein, he might have laughed  superstition out of England. When he described the dreadful power of  holy water and frankincense and the book of exorcisms \"to scald, broyle  and sizzle the devil,\" or \"the dreadful power of the crosse and  sacrament of the altar to torment the devill and to make him roare,\" or  \"the astonishable power of nicknames, reliques and asses ears,\"[44] he  revealed a faculty of fun-making just short of effective humor.    It would not be fair to leave Harsnett without a word on his place as a  writer. In point of literary distinction his prose style maintains a  high level. In the use of forceful epithet and vivid phrase he is  excelled by no Elizabethan prose writer. Because his writings deal so  largely with dry-as-dust reports of examinations, they have never  attained to that position in English literature which parts of them  merit.[45]    Harsnett's book was the last chapter in the story of Elizabethan  witchcraft and exorcism. It is hardly too much to say that it was the  first chapter in the literary exploitation of witchcraft. Out of the  _Declaration_ Shakespeare and Ben Jonson mined those ores which when  fused and refined by imagination and fancy were shaped into the shining  forms of art. Shakespearean scholars have pointed out the connection  between the dramatist and the exposer of exorcism. It has indeed been  suggested by one student of Shakespeare that the great playwright was  lending his aid by certain allusions in _Twelfth Night_ to Harsnett's  attempts to pour ridicule on Puritan exorcism.[46] It would be hard to  say how much there is in this suggestion. About Ben Jonson we can speak  more certainly. It is clearly evident that he sneered at Darrel's  pretended possessions. In the third scene of the fifth act of _The Devil  is an Ass_ he makes Mere-craft say:        It is the easiest thing, Sir, to be done.      As plaine as fizzling: roule but wi' your eyes,      And foame at th' mouth. A little castle-soape      Will do 't, to rub your lips: And then a nutshell,      With toe and touchwood in it to spit fire,      Did you ner'e read, Sir, little _Darrel's_ tricks,      With the boy o' _Burton_, and the 7 in _Lancashire_,      Sommers at _Nottingham_? All these do teach it.      And wee'l give out, Sir, that your wife ha's bewitch'd you.    This is proof enough, not only that Jonson was in sympathy with the  Anglican assailants of Puritan exorcism, but that he expected to find  others of like opinion among those who listened to his play. And it was  not unreasonable that he should expect this. It is clear enough that the  powers of the Anglican church were behind Harsnett and that their  influence gave his views weight. We have already observed that there  were some evidences in the last part of Elizabeth's reign of a reaction  against witch superstition. Harsnett's book, while directed primarily  against exorcism, is nevertheless another proof of that reaction.      [1] Sir George Peckham of Denham near Uxbridge and Lord Vaux of Hackney  were two of the most prominent Catholics who opened their homes for  these performances. See Samuel Harsnett, _Declaration of Egregious  Popish Impostures_ (London, 1603), 7, 8.    [2] For a discussion of the Catholic exorcists see T. G. Law, \"Devil  Hunting in Elizabethan England,\" in the _Nineteenth Century_ for March,  1894. Peckham's other activities in behalf of his church are discussed  by Dr. R. B. Merriman in \"Some Notes on the Treatment of English  Catholics in the Reign of Elizabeth,\" in the _Am. Hist. Rev._, April,  1908. Dr. Merriman errs, however, in supposing that John Darrel  cooperated with Weston and the Catholic exorcists; _ibid._, note 51.  Darrel was a Puritan and had nothing to do with the Catholic  performances.    [3] It is quite possible to suppose, however, that its course would have  been run in much the same way at a later time.    [4] For Harsnett's account of Katherine Wright see his _Discovery of the  Fraudulent Practises of John Darrel_ (London, 1599), 297-315. For  Darrel's story see _The Triall of Maist. Dorrel, or A Collection of  Defences against Allegations ..._ (1599), 15-21.    [5] See Harsnett, _Discovery_, 310.    [6] Katherine Wright's evil spirit returned later.    [7] \"I have seene her begging at our doore,\" he declared, \"as for her  name I know it not.\"    [8] Harsnett, _Discovery_, 41, 265, deals briefly with the Darling case  and Alse Gooderidge. See also John Darrel, _A Detection of that sinnful,  shamful, lying, and ridiculous discours of Samuel Harshnet_ (1600),  38-40. But the fullest account is a pamphlet at the Lambeth Palace  library. It is entitled _The most wonderfull and true Storie of a  certaine Witch named Alse Gooderidge of Stapenhill.... As also a true  Report of the strange Torments of Thomas Darling...._ (London, 1597).  For a discussion of this pamphlet see appendix A, Sec. 1.    [9] The boy was visited by a stranger who tried to persuade him that  there were no witches. But this Derbyshire disciple of Scot had come to  the wrong place and his efforts were altogether useless.    [10] Meantime her mother Elizabeth Wright was also being worried. She  was found on her knees in prayer. No doubt the poor woman was taking  this method of alleviating her distress; but her devotion was  interpreted as worship of the Devil.    [11] So Darrel says. The pamphleteer Denison, who put together the story  of Alse Gooderidge, wrote \"she should have been executed but that her  spirit killed her in prison.\"    [12] Darrel gives an extended account of this affair in _A True  Narration of the strange and grevous Vexation by the Devil of seven  persons in Lancashire_ (1600; reprinted in _Somers Tracts_, III),  170-179. See also George More, _A true Discourse concerning the certaine  possession and dispossession of 7 persons in one familie in Lancashire ..._  (1600), 9 ff.    [13] Certain matters in connection with this case are interesting.  George More tells us that Mrs. Starchie was an \"inheritrix.\" Some of her  kindred, Papists, prayed for the perishing of her issue. Four of her  children pined away. Mrs. Starchie, when told of their prayers, conveyed  all her property to her husband. She had two children afterwards, the  two that were stricken. It is possible that all this may present some  key to the case, but it is hard to see just how. See More, _A true  Discourse_, 11-12.    [14] George More, _A true Discourse_, 15; Harsnett, _Discovery_, 22.  While Dee took no part in the affair except that he \"sharply reproved  and straitly examined\" Hartley, he lent Mr. Hopwood, the justice of the  peace before whom Hartley was brought, his copy of the book of Wierus,  then the collections of exorcisms known as the _Flagellum Daemonum_ and  the _Fustis Daemonum_, and finally the famous _Malleus Maleficarum_. See  Dee's _Private Diary_ (Camden Soc., London, 1843), entries for March 19,  April 15, and August 6, 1597.
