Going down the gangway they bargained with the  natives, giving little articles in exchange for fruit.    Mr. Atherton was evidently of the captain's opinion as to the necessity  for prudence, and had stationed himself with his rifle near the gangway.    \"They look quite peaceful and cheerful,\" Marion Renshaw said to him. \"Do  you think there is really any use in all these precautions, Mr.  Atherton?\"    \"I do indeed, Miss Renshaw. I do not think one can be too careful when  dealing with people who are notoriously so treacherous.\"    \"Are you a good shot with a rifle, Mr. Atherton?\"    \"Yes; although I say it myself, I am an exceptionally good shot. I have  practised a great deal with the rifle, and have, I suppose, a natural  aptitude for it; for when I fire I am morally certain of hitting my  mark, though I am hardly conscious of taking aim.\"    When the contents of a few boats had been taken on board the captain  made signs that he required no more, and the natives, with looks of  evident discontent, paddled back to the shore.    \"We shall have some chiefs off in the morning,\" the captain said.  \"To-day they have kept in the background, but seeing that we are wary  and on our guard they will probably come off to-morrow to view matters  for themselves. I shall let them perceive that I am well prepared, and  it may be when they see this they will be inclined to do a little honest  trading, and to bring off a strong spar with which we can at anyrate  make a shift for our mainmast. We will keep watch and watch as if we  were at sea. It is as likely as not some of their canoes may be coming  out in the night to see if we are to be caught napping.\"    \"It is horrid,\" Kate Mitford said, as she with her sister, Marion, and  several of the younger passengers stood together that evening on the  poop looking towards the shore. The young moon was sinking in the west,  the stars shone with great brilliancy, and the water was as smooth as  glass. The outline of the palms could be made out against the sky, and  in several places the light of fires could be perceived, and the  stillness of the evening was broken by the hum of distant voices. \"It is  really a shame that we cannot go ashore. I am sure the savages looked  civil and friendly, and it would be delightful to wander about in such a  wood as that.\"    Two or three voices were raised in assent.    \"Have you heard the little story of the spider and the fly, Miss Kate?\"  Mr. Atherton said, moving across from the other side of the deck, where  he was smoking a cigar. \"In that case, you know, it was the prettiest  little bower that ever you did espy, and perhaps the fly admired it just  as much as you admire that grove ashore. The result of a visit would be  identical in both cases. Those on board other ships have been taken in  by the peaceful appearance of the natives and the loveliness of the  islands, and the result was fatal to them. Personally, I should feel  much more comfortable if I saw those savages putting out in a body in  their canoes to attack the ship than I do now while they are keeping up  this pretence of friendliness. An open danger one can meet, but when you  know that treachery is intended, but have no idea what form it will take  or when the mask of friendship will be thrown off, it is trying to the  nerves. Fortunately we know their character, and may hope to be ready  when the danger comes. Still the waiting is trying.\"    \"And you really feel that, Mr. Atherton?\" Marion Renshaw asked.    \"I do indeed, Miss Renshaw. We may get away without trouble; but if so,  it will be solely because the natives see that we are prepared for them  and are not to be taken by surprise. Seeing our crippled state, my own  opinion is, that the natives will not let us go off without making at  least one attempt to surprise us.\"    Mr. Atherton spoke strongly, for he thought that it was possible that  some of the youngsters might, unless thoroughly roused to a sense of  danger, do something foolish and rash. His words had the effect desired.  His share in the affair at Rio had caused him to be regarded with  respect and admiration by the young men on board, and they felt that if  in his opinion the danger was grave it was not for them to doubt its  reality. A vigilant watch was kept all night, and loaded muskets were  served out to the watch on deck. The guns had been loaded before they  anchored, and the spare muskets were placed so as to be handy for the  watch below should they be suddenly called up. After the moon went down  a light mist rose on the surface of the sea. Several times during the  night faint sounds were heard near the ship, but immediately the officer  of the watch challenged, silence reigned for a considerable time.    \"How has the night passed, Ryan?\" Mr. Atherton asked the first officer  as soon as he came on deck, just as daylight was breaking.    \"There have been some of them near us all night,\" Mr. Ryan replied. \"I  do not think they were in force, but they wanted to see whether we kept  a sharp watch; and I think we have satisfied them as to that, for  everytime the slightest noise was heard we hailed at once. I should like  to have sent a musket-ball in the direction of the sound, but as we must  get a spar, if possible, and shall be all the better for a score or two  casks of fresh water, it won't do to begin to quarrel with them. Once we  get what we want on board the beggars may attack us as soon as they  like. It would do them a world of good to get handsomely thrashed, and  to be taught that vessels are not to be plundered with impunity.\"    \"As you say, it might do them good, but I hope there will be no trouble.  I have no doubt whatever that we should beat them off, but we might lose  some lives in doing it; besides, we have ladies on board.\"    \"I hope so too; and, prepared as we are, I should feel quite safe if it  was not for that mast being gone. They know that we are comparative  cripples, and no doubt looked upon us as lawful booty when they saw us  making in; and I do not think they will let themselves be balked of  their prey without an effort.\"    \"That is just my view of the matter, and I mean to keep a sharp look-out  while we are here. You will all have your hands full, and I will get two  or three of the young fellows to join with me in keeping a sharp watch  over their doings.\"    \"That is a good plan,\" the mate agreed. \"There will, as you say, be  plenty for us to do, and it worries one to have to attend to work and to  keep one's eyes at the back of one's head at the same time. Of course we  shall always have a watch set whatever we are doing, still I have more  faith in your look-out than in that of half a dozen fo'castle hands.\"    When the two Allens and Wilfrid came on deck Mr. Atherton drew them  aside. \"Look here, lads,\" he began. \"You heard what I said last night. I  meant it, and I am sure I was not wrong, for there have been canoes  hovering about us all night. Now, in a short time the officers and crew  will be seeing about getting water on board, and if the natives bring  out a spar that will do as a jury mainmast there will be the work of  trimming it, getting it into its place, and rigging it. My own opinion  is, that now the natives see we are suspicious and on the watch they  will for some time make a show of being extremely friendly so as to  throw us off our guard, and as the officers and sailors will be busy  they may possibly relax their precautions a little. Now I propose that  you and I shall constitute an amateur watch from sunrise to dark. After  that the men's work will be done, and there will be no fear of their  being taken by surprise. The real danger is, I think, in the daytime.  Wilfrid and I will take the second-mate's watch, and do you two take the  first-mate's--that is, if you agree to my proposal.\"    The three young fellows at once expressed their willingness to do as he  directed them.    \"During our respective watches,\" Mr. Atherton went on, \"we must keep our  attention directed solely to the natives. There must be no watching what  is going on on board, no talking and laughing with the other passengers;  we must consider ourselves as if on duty. One of us must take his place  on the fo'castle, the other in the waist. The natives are sure to hang  round the ship in their canoes watching what we are doing, and offering  things for sale. It will be our duty to keep a vigilant eye upon them,  to watch every movement, to give instant warning if their number is at  any time larger than usual, and, in fact, to prevent the possibility of  their closing suddenly in upon us and taking us by surprise. Remember,  it is a case of absolute duty; I have volunteered to the first officer  to undertake it, and he will, relying upon our vigilance, give his  attention to his work.\"    \"Shall we be armed, Mr. Atherton?\" James Allen asked.    \"Yes, James, I think that it will be as well to have our guns beside us  while on duty. Of course there is no occasion to have them on our  shoulders like sentries, but it will be well to have them always within  reach of the hand in case of sudden danger. The report of a musket would  give the alarm far quicker and more effectually than a shout would do,  especially if men are at work on deck and making a noise. Well, as you  agree, we will begin after breakfast.\"    \"How about meals, sir?\" Tom Allen asked. \"If they mean to make an attack  I should think they would be likely to choose meal-time, when the  passengers are all below and the deck will be comparatively deserted.\"    \"We must keep watch then also,\" Mr. Atherton said decidedly. \"I will  speak to Mr. Ryan and ask him to tell the steward that two of us will  require something put on the table for them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33662"],[0,"A Republic Without a President, and Other Stories (#18)"],[1,"irsty.\"  Dr. Randolph looked at the speaker, whose wavering eye vainly strove to  elude his. The Doctor seemed to be balancing in his mind whether to  grant the guest his wish or not.    \"Look here, old boy,\" said Harland, almost with a whine, \"it isn't fair,  doncherno, to bring a fellow in here and stare at him that way. My  beagles wouldn't treat me so. I'm burning up with thirst. Just a little.  That's hospitable, you know.\" He finished with a sigh and a fuddled look  of entreaty. He had gone a half an hour without alcohol.    \"I beg your pardon, Slack,\" said Randolph slowly, \"of course you shall  have it. But I would rather give you some cordial of mine first. It  will take your thirst away sooner than your infernal liquor.\"    Slack nodded wearily, while the Doctor unlocked a black cabinet and took  from thence a brittle flask and a liqueur glass. He held the flask up to  the light before Slack's face. The liquid flamed yellow in the gaslight.  It seemed to have concentrated in its ebullient elements the  exhilaration of life. Now, the yellow cordial, even as the inebriate  looked upon it, glowed and became incandescent. It seemed to be endowed  with its own principle of energy. Harland Slack started up, and looked  at this phenomenon more closely with intelligent astonishment.    \"This,\" said Dr. Alaric Randolph observantly, \"is the issue of many  laborious years abroad. This is the theriaca against all vital poisons.  Watch it; for even as you look upon it, you absorb its virtue.\"    There was no melodrama in the Doctor's action or accent. He spoke quite  naturally. Harland was as much impressed by his friend's sincerity as by  the singular appearance of this _elixir vitae_. He did not need to be  urged to look at the glass again. It was a fountain of boiling light.    At this moment, a knock was heard at that door of the reception room  which evidently led into the Doctor's inner office. Dr. Randolph  started, quickly locked the door leading into the hall, and put the  priceless flask gently upon a high bookcase. It was on a level with his  face. The liquid shot bubbles of animation to the surface; and before  Slack's eyes, as if gathering fire from the light or the heat, it slowly  began to turn red. The languid debauchee now jumped nimbly to his feet  and stood entranced before this beautiful, perplexing transformation.    \"Keep your eyes on it for a moment, my friend,\" whispered Dr. Randolph:  \"watch it carefully for me. I wish to note its changes. It differs under  variable conditions. Tell me about it. Do not touch it. When I come back  you shall taste, and then--\" Harland lost the last words as the  physician hurried out.    Harland Slack, feeling a dull sense of scientific responsibility, fixed  his eyes upon the occult fluid, watching its strange manifestations  eagerly. His brain throbbed with thoughts. If the mere sight of this  curious elixir could clear the clots of alcohol from his blood and his  will, what might come of a draught? He walked for the first few moments  about the room briskly. He stood erect: but he did not take his gaze  from the flask, nor did he touch it. It now shot forth colors of the  ruby. Along the rim played the fires of the spinel. These gave way to  the glow of the garnet; which in turn vanished before gleams whose  indescribable radiance is only likened to the blood of the pigeon.  Harland was eager not to lose the lightest stage of this marvellous  metamorphosis. With every new hue fresh streams of blood seemed to come  into his heart. He felt so strangely that he soon began to doubt whether  he were sober or not. He rubbed his eyes, and pinched his ears. Yes, he  was awake and sane. This was no delirium of a caked brain. His mind was  as clear as the waters of the Bermuda reefs. If he had been an opium  eater, he might have thought these the legitimate effects of the dusky  drug.    As soon as he had thoroughly assured himself of the validity of his  reason he began to hear music. It came from the inner room whither the  Doctor had gone. Without taking his eyes off of the blazing flask,  Harland backed up to the door and listened. The strains sounded louder  as he approached. There seemed to be a castanet, and a harp, and  singing. In surprise he touched the door. It opened lightly. His  curiosity proved stronger then the power of the elixir to restrain him,  and he turned. A low cry of amazement leaped from his lips. He stopped  irresolute and looked back. The glittering alembic was extinguished. The  liquid shone but dully in the feeble jets of gas. What could there have  been to fascinate, he mused, in that carafe of--water?    He forgot the Doctor. He abandoned the theriaca. He strode into the vast  hall that opened up before him. As he advanced, his head whirled with a  new intoxication. He wondered how so narrow a house could contain such a  superb apartment. Then he perceived, or he fancied that two or more  buildings had been thrown into one. It was the only explanation of the  spacious area which his imagination afforded, and it satisfied him.    Before him extended a banquet-hall decorated with Oriental magnificence,  and lighted with many lamps. In its centre was a sumptuous table. Black  servants flitted noiselessly about. Upon a yellow rug at one side  crouched a dark dancing girl, clad in gauze, waving a gauze scarf. She  reminded him of something he had read about the celebrated dancers of  the Maharajah of Mysore. This beautiful girl, with a bewitching effort  at unconsciousness, arose and whirled down the long hall towards the  young man, waving her bare arms to the accompaniment of stringed  instruments and the measured drone of the players. Suddenly the dancer,  with a blinding pirouette, wound her veils modestly about her, saluted  Harland with a profound, mocking courtesy, and then pointing to the  table wafted herself away. Harland was confounded. What strange orgy was  this? What a scene from India dropped upon bleak, staid New England!    When he had accustomed his eyes to the blaze of light he saw that  another woman was in the room. This one was reclining at the table. He  recognized her immediately. This fact pleased him; for it assured him  that he was still himself. It also troubled him, for he had solemnly  vowed never to allow his eyes to rest upon her again. She had haunted  him with her beauty and her insolence since he had forsworn her. There  flashed his sapphire bracelet on her slender arm, and the Alexandrite  for which he had sent to Russia, took to itself at her white throat  alternate virulent moods of red and green. She was entrancing, and he  loved her. She was his evil genius, and he feared her. She had flattered  and despised him, and he hated her. How laughingly she had lured him  with her jewelled hand and iridescent eyes down the pleasant path that  brought up at his fatal vice! He thought of her polite orgies, her  theatre suppers, her one o'clock germans, and her select parties at  suburban hotels. To his besotted brain she was a scarlet witch and he  fled from her, and returned, and fled again.    But what manner of man was this Doctor? Why would they trap him?--weak,  sodden thing that he was, and knew that he was.    Now, as he looked upon her there was a snap in his heart, and her power  upon him seemed to give away and break like a valve in the aorta. How  was this possible? Could a man _not_ care for her? With sudden  surprising disdain he approached the beautiful creature before whom he  had so often trembled. She did not look up at him, but threw herself  back further on the couch and motioned to a servant for some wine.  Something about her super-human grace revolted him. The music redoubled.  The Indian dancer fanned him as she sped past. He did not notice her. He  was above intoxication of the senses. What was this woman? What her  wine? In a kind of sacred, cold revolt, he stood aloof. He was in an  ecstasy of moral freedom. He advanced a step or two, looked down at her  from his tall height and ejaculated brutally:    \"_You_ here?\"    She did not look up at this insult. Her cheek, neck, and ears flushed  and then became deadly pale. A sneer now spread itself over her chin  and mouth.    \"And why not, you poor fool?\" The opprobrious epithet seemed feebly to  express the infinite contempt in which she--even she--had held him. She  had called him this with equal scorn more than once before, in her  drawing-room, and he had never felt the shadow of resentment. He had  been accustomed to laugh feebly and to turn the unpleasant personality  away as well as he could. But now, he became aware of the contumely for  the first time. He clenched his fists; he breathed heavily. He did not  trust himself to speak. He ground his teeth. His thoughts became  singularly clear. He took another step nearer. She turned her haughty  head and smiled mockingly at him, clicking the glass with her  finely-manicured finger.    \"I did not know, sir, that _you_ were a friend of the great Doctor,\" she  chirped in her falsetto voice, and her lip curled.    \"Its a lie! I am not! He is a scoundrel!\"    Harland spoke savagely. He could not understand this moral convulsion  that within the last few minutes, had dominated his nature. He could  only express it. What was this house? For the first time the query  arose: What had he to do with a questionable evening?    \"You are drunk, as usual,\" answered the woman with a pert upward motion  of disgust.    At this, which he knew to be a libel for once, Harland's hand tore at  his heart: a terrible rush of blood ran to his brain. The music hushed.  The dark dancing-girl sank with exhaustion to her rug. The room was  stifling. The air was heavy with the perfume of roses, and attar, and  wine. Yet the young man's head was poised, his eyes were sane, his  senses untouched. With a supreme effort he held his anger in check. The  beauty, not realizing the extent to which she had tortured him,"]]]
