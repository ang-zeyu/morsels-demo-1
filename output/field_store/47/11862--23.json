To the boy's great delight, he found that the three troopers dropped  into their places in the most easy manner, obeying his every order with  alacrity and displaying all the readiness of well-drilled men.  They  began by assisting at once with the cleaning and easing of the  drawbridge chains, one of them, after stripping off his coat, gorget,  and cap, climbing the supports to apply the lubricant to the rollers  from outside, where they needed it most; and when, that evening, Ben  suggested that one of the guns standing in the pleasaunce should be  examined, they made the servants stare by the deft way in which they  helped him to handle the ponderous mass of metal, hitching on ropes and  dragging it out from where it had lain half-covered with ivy to where it  was now planted, so that it could be made to sweep the road-way  approaching the bridge; the other one in the garden being afterwards  treated in the same way.    \"Well, yes, sir, they're pretty heavy,\" said the corporal, in answer to  a compliment passed by Roy upon the ease with which the work had been  done; \"but it isn't all strength that does it.  It's knack--the way of  handling a thing and all putting your muscle into it together.\"    \"Ay, that's it,\" said Ben.  \"That's what you see in a good charge.  If  it's delivered in a scattering sort o' way it may do good, but the  chance is it won't.  But if the men ride on shoulder to shoulder and  knee to knee, and then give point altogether--\"    \"Yes, as Sir Granby Royland's regiment can,\" said the corporal, proudly.    \"Ay, and always did,\" cried Ben, excitedly.  \"It takes something to  stand against 'em.\"    There was a dead silence then, and Roy's heart beat fast, for the war  spirit was getting hold of him tightly, for his eyes flashed, and his  eagerness to go on with the preparations grew stronger every hour.    \"Now, about these guns, sergeant?\" he said.    Ben's eyes twinkled as his rank was mentioned, and he gave his young  master a grateful look.    \"Well, sir,\" he said, \"they've been fast asleep in that garden all these  years, with enough ivy over 'em to keep 'em warm in winter and the sun  off 'em in summer; but, now they've been woke up, I believe they'll bark  as loudly and bite as well as any dogs of their size.  If they'd been  cast iron, I should have been for putting a very light charge in 'em and  standing a good way off when they were fired, but, seeing as they're  regular good brass guns and not a bit worn, all they want is a good  cleaning up, and then they'll be fit to do their work like--like--well,  sir, like guns.  What do you say, corporal?\"    \"I say they're a fine and sound pair o' guns, sergeant, as'll do their  work.  We should like a night's rest first, but in the morning my two  lads and me will give 'em a good scour up, and you won't know 'em  again.\"    \"Right!  If the captain says yes, you shall; but I want to be with you--  I'm armourer here.\"    \"Oh, of course, sergeant,\" said the trooper.  \"Don't you think we want  to take your place.\"    \"I don't, my lad,\" said the old soldier, warmly; \"and I'm only too glad  to have three comrades out of the reg'lars to stand by me and help me to  lick the recruits into shape.\"    \"Thank ye, sergeant,\" said the man.  \"We four can soon do that.  They're  the right stuff, and only want a bit o' training.\"  Then, turning and  saluting Roy respectfully, he went on: \"Sir Granby give us all a  talking-to, sir, and said he'd picked us out because we--I mean  t'others--was the handiest fellows he knew in the regiment, and he hoped  we'd do our best to get things in a good state of defence.  And, of  course, sir, we shall.\"    The great, manly fellow spoke with a simple modesty that made Ben's eyes  sparkle, and he nodded his head and remained silent when the man had  ended, but gave vent to his satisfaction by bringing his hand down  heavily upon the trooper's shoulder.    \"We'll see to the other guns now then,\" said Roy.    \"Yes, sir,\" said Ben, promptly.  \"Forward there to the sou'-east tower.\"    The three men marched off at once in the direction pointed out, and Ben  stopped back for a moment or two to whisper to Roy, in a quick, vexed  manner--    \"Don't go on saying we'll do this next, or we'll do that next, sir, as  if you was asking a favour of us.  You're captain and castellan, as they  calls him.  You're governor and everything, and you've got to order us  to do things sharp, short, and strong.\"    \"But I don't want to bully you all, Ben,\" cried Roy.    \"Nobody wants you to, sir.  You can't be bullying a man when you're  ordering him sharply to do what's right.  Of course, if you ask us in  your civil way to do a thing, we shall do it, but it aren't correct.\"    \"I'll try differently, Ben.\"    \"Sergeant, sir!\"    \"Ser-_geant_,\" said Roy.  \"But it's all so new yet, I can't quite  realise it.  And, of course, I'm so young to be ordering big men about.\"    \"You've the right to do it, sir, and that's everything.  Now, just  suppose the enemy was in front playing up ruination and destruction, and  your father was going to charge 'em with his regiment of tough dragoons,  do you think he'd say, `Now, my men, I want you to--or I'd like you to  attack those rapscallions yonder'?  Not he.  He'd just say a word to the  trumpeter, there'd be a note or two blown, and away we'd go at a walk;  another blast, and we should trot; then another, and away we should be  at 'em like a whirlwind, and scatter 'em like leaves.  You must learn to  order us, sir, sharply.  Mind, sir, it's _must_!\"    \"Very well,\" said Roy.    \"Don't you be afraid, sir; let us have your order sharp, whatever it is,  and we'll do it.\"    \"Then don't stand chattering there, sir!\" cried Roy, fiercely.  \"Can't  you see those three men are waiting for you at the bottom of the tower?  Forward!\"    \"Ck!\"    It was an unspeakable ejaculation which came from the old soldier's  throat as he turned sharply and marched off to the men, chuckling to  himself and shaking his shoulders as he went.    \"He'll do,\" he muttered; and then aloud, \"Up with you, my lads!\"    Ben followed the men, and Roy came last, and, as he entered the  door-way, he thought of the journey down to the powder-magazine, and  felt a little shame at his nervousness.    Then up and up past the two floors and on towards the roof.  As he  reached the door-way leading out on to the battlements, he stood in the  gloomy interior, and looked along the roof of the untenanted portion  towards the north-west tower, wondering what Master Pawson was doing.    He was not left in doubt, for he could just see the secretary standing  back from one of the narrow windows scanning the tower he was in,  evidently having seen them enter, and watching to see what they were  about to do.    A bit of boyishness entered into Roy just then, brought about by the  business he was upon and the work he had been engaged in.    \"I should like to startle him,\" he said to himself, as he gave his  mischievous thought play.  \"One might load and train one of the guns,  and fire the blank charge aimed just over his head.  It would startle  him.\"    The thought passed away directly, and he went up to the roof, where the  four men were together upon the platform examining the two guns facing  the embrasures.    These were not quite so big as the two standing now beneath the  gate-way, but, for the date, they were of a pretty good size, and having  the wood-work of the mounting in excellent condition.    \"Well, how do they look?\"  Roy asked.    \"Better than I thought, sir.  They'll do.  Only want a good cleaning.  If you think a charge or two ought to be fired, sir, as was talked  about, shall it be with one of these?\"    \"If--yes; fire them both,\" said Roy; and then he felt astonished at the  fact that what he had imagined in mischief was really to be carried out.    \"Next order, sir?\" said Ben, gazing in his captain's face.    \"See to the other guns on the north-east and south-west towers.\"    \"Yes, sir.  What's to be done with the two as was slung down when Master  Pawson's rooms was furnished?\"    \"Sling them up again,\" cried Roy, promptly.  \"It is necessary now.\"    Ben gave his leg a slap and looked his satisfaction.    \"Wouldn't like the two big guns hoisted over the gate-way, sir, I  s'pose?\"    \"No, certainly not,\" cried Roy; \"they will be of more value to sweep the  approach of the castle.  I'll have them kept there.  Plenty of room to  fire on each side of the drawbridge if it's up, and the muzzles would  run through the square openings in the portcullis.\"    Old Ben stared at him round eyed, and shook his head; then he chuckled  softly, and, muttering to himself his former words, \"He'll do,\" he led  the men to the south-west tower, upon whose platform three brass guns  were mounted, and then to the north-east, where there were three more.    Twelve guns in all for the defence of the castle; but the question was,  would the ammunition be of any use?  Balls there were in abundance, for,  in addition to piles standing pyramidally at the foot of each tower,  half-covered now by flowers and shrubs, there were similar piles close  to the carriage of each gun.  But the vital force of the gun, the energy  that should set the ball whizzing through the air, was the question, and  to prove this, Ben asked for an order, and then walked with his young  captain to the armoury, where he opened the great closet.  One of the  kegs was brought out and set down upon the broad oak table.    \"I've been thinking, sir, that perhaps it would be best to fire the big  guns under the gate-way to-night.\"    \"Why?\" asked Roy.    \"Because we know their carriages are right, and I'm a bit doubtful about  those upon the tower.\"    \"Very well; try the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2546"],[0,"Hopalong Cassidy's Rustler Round-Up; Or, Bar-20 (#18)"],[1,"at a somber horned-toad. \"Wow!\" he yelled as his  feet took huge steps up in the air, each one strictly on its own course.  \"Woof!\" he grunted in the hot sand as he arose on his hands and knees  and spat alkali.    \"What's s'matter?\" He asked dazedly of Johnny Nelson. \"Ain't it funny!\"  he yelled sarcastically as he beheld Johnny holding his sides with  laughter. \"Ain't it funny!\" he repeated belligerently. \"Of course that  four-laigged, knock-kneed, wobblin' son-of-a-Piute had to cut me out.  They wasn't nobody in sight but Billy! Why didn't yu say he was comin'?  Think I can see four ways to once? Why didn't--\" At this point Red  cantered up with a calf, and by a quick maneuver, drew the taut rope  against the rear of Billy's knees, causing that unfortunate to sit down  heavily. As he arose choking with broken-winded profanity Red dragged  the animal to the fire, and Billy forgot his grievances in the press of  labor.    \"How many, Buck?\" Asked Red.    \"One-eighty.\"    \"How does she stand?\"    \"Yore eighteen to th' bad,\" replied the foreman. \"Th' son-of-a-gun!\"  marveled Red, riding off.    Another whoop interrupted them, and Billy quit watching out of the  corner eye for pugnacious calves as he prepared for Hopalong.    \"Hey, Buck, this here cuss was with a Barred-Horseshoe cow,\" he  announced as he turned it over to the branding man. Buck made a tally in  a separate column and released the animal. \"Hullo, Red! Workin'?\" Asked  Hopalong of his rival.    \"Some, yu little cuss,\" answered Red with all the good nature in the  world. Hopalong was his particular \"side partner,\" and he could lose to  him with the best of feelings.    \"Yu looks so nice an' cool, an' clean, I didn't know,\" responded  Hopalong, eyeing a streak of sweat and dust which ran from Red's eyes to  his chin and then on down his neck.    \"What yu been doin'? Plowin' with yore nose?\" Returned Red, smiling  blandly at his friend's appearance.    \"Yah!\" snorted Hopalong, wheeling toward the corral. \"Come on, yu  pie-eatin' doodle-bug; I'll beat yu to th' gate!\"    The two ponies sent showers of sand all over Billy, who eyed them  in pugnacious disgust. \"Of all th' locoed imps that ever made life  miserable fer a man, them's th' worst! Is there any piece of fool  nonsense they hain't harnessed me with?\" He beseeched of Buck. \"Is there  anything they hain't done to me? They hides my liquor; they stuffs th'  sweat band of my hat with rope; they ties up my pants; they puts water  in. My boots an' toads in my bunk--ain't they never goin' to get sane?\"    \"Oh, they're only kids--they can't help it,\" offered Buck. \"Didn't they  hobble my cayuse when I was on him an' near bust my neck?\"    Hopalong interrupted the conversation by driving up another calf, and  Buck, glancing at his watch, declared the contest at an end.    \"Yu wins,\" he remarked to the newcomer. \"An' now yu get scarce or Billy  will shore straddle yore nerves. He said as how he was goin' to get  square on yu to-night.\"    \"I didn't, neither, Hoppy!\" earnestly contradicted Billy, who bad  visions of a night spent in torment as a reprisal for such a threat.  \"Honest I didn't, did I, Johnny?\" He asked appealingly.    \"Yu shore did,\" lied Johnny, winking at Red, who had just ridden up.    \"I don't know what yore talkin' about, but yu shore did,\" replied Red.    \"If yu did,\" grinned Hopalong, \"I'll shore make yu hard to find. Come  on, fellows,\" he said; \"grub's ready. Where's Frenchy?\"    \"Over chewin' th' rag with Waffles about his hat--he's lost it again,\"  answered Red. \"He needs a guardian fer that bonnet. Th' Kid an'  Salvation has jammed it in th' corral fence an' Waffles has to stand fer  it.\"    \"Let's put it in th' grub wagon an see him cuss cookie,\" suggested  Hopalong.    \"Shore,\" indorsed Johnny; Cookie'll feed him bum grub for a week to get  square.    Hopalong and Johnny ambled over to the corral and after some trouble  located the missing sombrero, which they carried to the grub wagon and  hid in the flour barrel. Then they went over by the excited owner and  dropped a few remarks about how strange the cook was acting and how he  was watching Frenchy.    Frenchy jumped at the bait and tore over to the wagon, where he and the  cook spent some time in mutual recrimination. Hopalong nosed around and  finally dug up the hat, white as new-fallen snow.    \"Here's a hat--found it in th' dough barrel,\" he announced, handing it  over to Frenchy, who received it in open-mouthed stupefaction.    \"Yu pie-makin' pirate! Yu didn't know where my lid was, did yu! Yu  cross-eyed lump of hypocrisy!\" yelled Frenchy, dusting off the flour  with one full-armed swing on the cook's face, driving it into that  unfortunate's nose and eyes and mouth. \"Yu white-washed Chink, yu--rub  yore face with water an' yu've got pancakes.\"    \"Hey! What you doin'!\" yelled the cook, kicking the spot where he had  last seen Frenchy. \"Don't yu know better'n that!\"    \"Yu live close to yoreself or I'll throw yu so high th' sun'll duck,\"  replied Frenchy, a smile illuminating his face.    \"Hey, cookie,\" remarked Hopalong confidentially, \"I know who put up this  joke on yu. Yu ask Billy who hid th' hat,\" suggested the tease. \"Here he  comes now--see how queer he looks.\"    \"Th' mournful Piute,\" ejaculated the cook. \"I'll shore make him wish  he'd kept on his own trail. I'll flavor his slush [coffee] with year-old  dish-rags!\"    At this juncture Billy ambled up, keeping his weather eye peeled for  trouble. \"Who's a dish-rag?\" He queried. The cook mumbled something  about crazy hens not knowing when to quit cackling and climbed up in his  wagon. And that night Billy swore off drinking coffee.    When the dawn of the next day broke, Hopalong was riding toward the  Black Hills, leaving Billy to untie himself as best he might.    The trip was uneventful and several weeks later he entered Red Dog, a  rambling shanty town, one of those western mushrooms that sprang up in a  night. He took up his stand at the Miner's Rest, and finally secured  six claims at the cost of nine hundred hard-earned dollars, a fund  subscribed by the outfits, as it was to be a partnership affair.    He rode out to a staked-off piece of hillside and surveyed his purchase,  which consisted of a patch of ground, six holes, six piles of dirt and  a log hut. The holes showed that the claims bad been tried and found  wanting.    He dumped his pack of tools and provisions, which he had bought on the  way up, and lugged them into the cabin. After satisfying his curiosity  he went outside and sat down for a smoke, figuring up in his mind how  much gold he could carry on a horse. Then, as he realized that he could  get a pack mule to carry the surplus, he became aware of a strange  presence near at hand and looked up into the muzzle of a Sharp's rifle.  He grasped the situation in a flash and calmly blew several heavy smoke  rings around the frowning barrel.    \"Well?\" He asked slowly.    \"Nice day, stranger,\" replied the man with the rifle, \"but don't yu  reckon yu've made a mistake?\"    Hopalong glanced at the number burned on a near-by stake and carelessly  blew another smoke ring. He was waiting for the gun to waver.    \"No, I reckons not,\" he answered. \"Why?\"    \"Well, I'll jest tell yu since yu asks. This yere claim's mine an' I'm  a reg'lar terror, I am. That's why; an' seein' as it is, yu better amble  some.\"    Hopalong glanced down the street and saw an interested group watching  him, which only added to his rage for being in such a position. Then  he started to say something, faltered and stared with horror at a point  several feet behind his opponent. The \"terror\" sprang to one side in  response to Hop-along's expression, as if fearing that a snake or some  such danger threatened him. As he alighted in his new position he fell  forward and Hopalong slid a smoking Colt in its holster.    Several men left the distant group and ran toward the claim. Hopalong  reached his arm inside the door and brought forth his rifle, with which  he covered their advance.    \"Anything yu want?\" he shouted savagely.    The men stopped and two of them started to sidle in front of two others,  but Hopalong was not there for the purpose of permitting a move that  would screen any gun play and he stopped the game with a warning shout.  Then the two held up their hands and advanced.    \"We wants to git Dan,\" called out one of them, nodding at the prostrate  figure.    \"Come ahead,\" replied Hopalong, substituting a Colt for the rifle.      They carried their badly wounded and insensible burden back to those  whom they had left, and several curses were hurled at the cowboy, who  only smiled grimly and entered the hut to place things ready for a  siege, should one come. He had one hundred rounds of ammunition and  provisions enough for two weeks, with the assurance of reinforcements  long before that time would expire. He cut several rough loopholes and  laid out his weapons for quick handling. He knew that he could stop any  advance during the day and planned only for night attacks. How long  he could go without sleep did not bother him, because he gave it no  thought, as he was accustomed to short naps and could awaken at will or  at the slightest sound.    As dusk merged into dark he crept forth and collected several handfuls  of dry twigs, which he scattered around the hut, as the cracking of  these would warn him of an approach. Then he went in and went to sleep.    He awoke at daylight after a good night's rest, and feasted on canned  beans and peaches. Then he tossed the cans out of the door and shoved  his hat out. Receiving no response he walked out and surveyed the town  at his feet. A sheepish grin spread over his face as he realized that  there was no danger. Several red-shirted men passed by him on their way  to town, and one, a grizzled veteran of many gold camps, stopped and  sauntered up to him.    \"Mornin',\" said Hopalong.    \"Mornin',\" replied the"]]]
