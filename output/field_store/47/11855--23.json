She struggled against these impressions, refusing her assent to  the testimony of them, since all the pressure of credited opinion for  three hundred years has been directed towards stamping out real  knowledge, and so effectually has this been accomplished that we can  only recover the truth through much anguish. And so Mary passed the days  in a strange perturbation, clinging to common things and common  thoughts, as if she feared that one morning she would wake up in an  unknown world to a changed life. And Edward Darnell went day by day to  his labour and returned in the evening, always with that shining of  light within his eyes and upon his face, with the gaze of wonder that  was greater day by day, as if for him the veil grew thin and soon would  disappear.    From these great matters both in herself and in her husband Mary shrank  back, afraid, perhaps, that if she began the question the answer might  be too wonderful. She rather taught herself to be troubled over little  things; she asked herself what attraction there could be in the old  records over which she supposed Edward to be poring night after night in  the cold room upstairs. She had glanced over the papers at Darnell's  invitation, and could see but little interest in them; there were one or  two sketches, roughly done in pen and ink, of the old house in the west:  it looked a shapeless and fantastic place, furnished with strange  pillars and stranger ornaments on the projecting porch; and on one side  a roof dipped down almost to the earth, and in the centre there was  something that might almost be a tower rising above the rest of the  building. Then there were documents that seemed all names and dates,  with here and there a coat of arms done in the margin, and she came upon  a string of uncouth Welsh names linked together by the word 'ap' in a  chain that looked endless. There was a paper covered with signs and  figures that meant nothing to her, and then there were the pocket-books,  full of old-fashioned writing, and much of it in Latin, as her husband  told her--it was a collection as void of significance as a treatise on  conic sections, so far as Mary was concerned. But night after night  Darnell shut himself up with the musty rolls, and more than ever when he  rejoined her he bore upon his face the blazonry of some great adventure.  And one night she asked him what interested him so much in the papers he  had shown her.    He was delighted with the question. Somehow they had not talked much  together for the last few weeks, and he began to tell her of the records  of the old race from which he came, of the old strange house of grey  stone between the forest and the river. The family went back and back,  he said, far into the dim past, beyond the Normans, beyond the Saxons,  far into the Roman days, and for many hundred years they had been petty  kings, with a strong fortress high up on the hill, in the heart of the  forest; and even now the great mounds remained, whence one could look  through the trees towards the mountain on one side and across the yellow  sea on the other. The real name of the family was not Darnell; that was  assumed by one Iolo ap Taliesin ap Iorwerth in the sixteenth  century--why, Darnell did not seem to understand. And then he told her  how the race had dwindled in prosperity, century by century, till at  last there was nothing left but the grey house and a few acres of land  bordering the river.    'And do you know, Mary,' he said, 'I suppose we shall go and live there  some day or other. My great-uncle, who has the place now, made money in  business when he was a young man, and I believe he will leave it all to  me. I know I am the only relation he has. How strange it would be. What  a change from the life here.'    'You never told me that. Don't you think your great-uncle might leave  his house and his money to somebody he knows really well? You haven't  seen him since you were a little boy, have you?'    'No; but we write once a year. And from what I have heard my father say,  I am sure the old man would never leave the house out of the family. Do  you think you would like it?'    'I don't know. Isn't it very lonely?'    'I suppose it is. I forget whether there are any other houses in sight,  but I don't think there are any at all near. But what a change! No City,  no streets, no people passing to and fro; only the sound of the wind and  the sight of the green leaves and the green hills, and the song of the  voices of the earth.'... He checked himself suddenly, as if he feared  that he was about to tell some secret that must not yet be uttered; and  indeed, as he spoke of the change from the little street in Shepherd's  Bush to that ancient house in the woods of the far west, a change seemed  already to possess himself, and his voice put on the modulation of an  antique chant. Mary looked at him steadily and touched his arm, and he  drew a long breath before he spoke again.    'It is the old blood calling to the old land,' he said. 'I was  forgetting that I am a clerk in the City.'    It was, doubtless, the old blood that had suddenly stirred in him; the  resurrection of the old spirit that for many centuries had been  faithful to secrets that are now disregarded by most of us, that now day  by day was quickened more and more in his heart, and grew so strong that  it was hard to conceal. He was indeed almost in the position of the man  in the tale, who, by a sudden electric shock, lost the vision of the  things about him in the London streets, and gazed instead upon the sea  and shore of an island in the Antipodes; for Darnell only clung with an  effort to the interests and the atmosphere which, till lately, had  seemed all the world to him; and the grey house and the wood and the  river, symbols of the other sphere, intruded as it were into the  landscape of the London suburb.    But he went on, with more restraint, telling his stories of far-off  ancestors, how one of them, the most remote of all, was called a saint,  and was supposed to possess certain mysterious secrets often alluded to  in the papers as the 'Hidden Songs of Iolo Sant.' And then with an  abrupt transition he recalled memories of his father and of the strange,  shiftless life in dingy lodgings in the backwaters of London, of the dim  stucco streets that were his first recollections, of forgotten squares  in North London, and of the figure of his father, a grave bearded man  who seemed always in a dream, as if he too sought for the vision of a  land beyond the strong walls, a land where there were deep orchards and  many shining hills, and fountains and water-pools gleaming under the  leaves of the wood.    'I believe my father earned his living,' he went on, 'such a living as  he did earn, at the Record Office and the British Museum. He used to  hunt up things for lawyers and country parsons who wanted old deeds  inspected. He never made much, and we were always moving from one  lodging to another--always to out-of-the-way places where everything  seemed to have run to seed. We never knew our neighbours--we moved too  often for that--but my father had about half a dozen friends, elderly  men like himself, who used to come to see us pretty often; and then, if  there was any money, the lodging-house servant would go out for beer,  and they would sit and smoke far into the night.    'I never knew much about these friends of his, but they all had the same  look, the look of longing for something hidden. They talked of mysteries  that I never understood, very little of their own lives, and when they  did speak of ordinary affairs one could tell that they thought such  matters as money and the want of it were unimportant trifles. When I  grew up and went into the City, and met other young fellows and heard  their way of talking, I wondered whether my father and his friends were  not a little queer in their heads; but I know better now.'    So night after night Darnell talked to his wife, seeming to wander  aimlessly from the dingy lodging-houses, where he had spent his boyhood  in the company of his father and the other seekers, to the old house  hidden in that far western valley, and the old race that had so long  looked at the setting of the sun over the mountain. But in truth there  was one end in all that he spoke, and Mary felt that beneath his words,  however indifferent they might seem, there was hidden a purpose, that  they were to embark on a great and marvellous adventure.    So day by day the world became more magical; day by day the work of  separation was being performed, the gross accidents were being refined  away. Darnell neglected no instruments that might be useful in the work;  and now he neither lounged at home on Sunday mornings, nor did he  accompany his wife to the Gothic blasphemy which pretended to be a  church. They had discovered a little church of another fashion in a back  street, and Darnell, who had found in one of the old notebooks the maxim  _Incredibilia sola Credenda_, soon perceived how high and glorious a  thing was that service at which he assisted. Our stupid ancestors taught  us that we could become wise by studying books on 'science,' by meddling  with test-tubes, geological specimens, microscopic preparations, and the  like; but they who have cast off these follies know that they must read  not 'science' books, but mass-books, and that the soul is made wise by  the contemplation of mystic ceremonies and elaborate and curious rites.  In such things Darnell found a wonderful mystery language, which spoke  at once more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2503"],[0,"Myths and Legends of California and the Old Southwest (#18)"],[1,"boy said, \"I will turn into a saguaro, so that I shall  live forever and bear fruit every summer.\"    The younger said, \"Then I will turn into a palo verde and stand there  forever. These mountains are so bare and have nothing on them but rocks,  I will make them green.\"    The old woman heard the cactus whistling and recognized the voice of her  grandson. So she went up to it and tried to take the prickly thing into  her arms, but the thorns killed her.    That is how the saguaro and the palo verde came to be on the mountains  and the desert.          The Thirsty Quails  Pima (Arizona)    A Quail once had more than twenty children, and with them she wandered  over the whole country in search of water and could not find it. It was  very hot and they were all crying, \"Where can we get some water? Where  can we get some water?\" but for a long time they could find none.    At last, way in the north, under a mesquite tree, the mother quail saw a  pond of water, but it was very muddy and not fit to drink. But the  little quails had been wandering so many days and were so tired they  stopped under the shade of the mesquite tree, and by and by, one by one,  they went down to the water and 'drank it. But the water was so bad they  all died.          The Boy and the Beast  Pima (Arizona)    Once an old woman lived with her daughter and son-in-law and their  little boy. They were following the trail of the Apache Indians. Now  whenever a Pima Indian sees the trail of an Apache he draws a ring  around it; then he can catch him sooner. And these Pimas drew circles  around the trail of the Apaches they were following, but one night when  they were asleep, the Apaches came down upon them. They took the man and  younger woman by the hair and shook them out of their skins, just as one  would shake corn out of a sack. So the boy and the old woman were left  alone.    Now these two had to live on berries and anything they could find, and  they wandered from place to place. In one place a strange beast, big  enough to swallow people, camped in the bushes near them. The  grand-mother told the boy not to go near these bushes. But the boy took  some sharp stones in his hands, and went toward them. As he came near,  the great monster began to breathe. He began to suck in his breath and  he sucked the boy right into his stomach. But with his sharp stones the  boy began to cut the beast, so that he died. Then the boy made a hole  large enough to climb out of.    When his grandmother came to look for him, the boy met her and said, \"I  have killed that monster.\"    The grandmother said, \"Oh, no. Such a little boy as you are to kill such  a great monster!\"    The boy said, \"But I was inside of him, just look at the stones I cut  him with.\"    Then the grandmother went softly up to the bushes, and looked at the  monster. It was full of holes, just as the little boy had said.    Then they moved down among the berry bushes and had all they wanted to  eat.          Why the Apaches are Fierce  Pima (Arizona)    Elder Brother, Coyote, and Earth Doctor, after the flood vanished, began  to create people and animals. Coyote made all the animals, Elder Brother  made the people, and Earth Doctor made queer creatures which had only  one leg, or immense ears, or many fingers, and some having flames of  fire in their knees.    Elder Brother divided his figures of people into four groups. One of the  Apaches came to life first. He shivered and said, \"Oh, it's very cold,\"  and began to sway back and forth. Then Elder Brother said, \"I did n't  think you would be the first to awake,\" and he took all the Apaches up  in his hand and threw them over the mountains. That made them angry, and  that is why they have always been so fierce.          Speech on the Warpath  Pima (Arizona)    We have come thus far, my brothers. In the east there is White Gopher,  who gnaws with his strong teeth. He was friendly and came to me. On his  way he came to the surface from the underground four times. Looking in  all four directions, he saw a magic whitish trail. Slowly following  this, he neared the enemy, coming to the surface from the underground  four times during the journey. Their power stood in their land like a  mountain, but he bit it off short, and he sank their springs by biting  them. He saw that the wind of the enemy was strong and he cut it up with  his teeth. He gnawed in short pieces their clouds. They had good dreams  and bright false-seeing, good bow strings and straight-flying reeds, but  these he grasped and bit off short. The different belongings lying about  he took with him, turning around homeward. On his way homeward over the  whitish trail, he came to the surface four times, and magic fire  appeared around the edges. Then he came to his bed. He felt that the  land roared rejoicingly with him.    In the south was Blue Coyote and there I sent my cry. He was friendly  and came to me from his blue darkness, circling around and shouting,  four times, on his journey, making magic fire everywhere. When he  arrived, he looked in four directions, then understood. A whitish magic  trail lay before him. He cast his blue darkness upon the enemy and  slowly approached them, circling around and shouting four times on the  way. Like a mountain was their power in the land, and he sucked it in.  The springs of water under the trees he sucked in. The wind that was  blowing he inhaled. He sucked in the clouds. The people dreamed of a  white thing, and their dreams he sucked in, with their best bow strings  and the straight-flying reeds. All the different belongings which lay  around he gathered and slowly turned back. Hidden in the blue darkness,  he came to me, circling around, shouting, four times on his journey.  Then he homeward took his way, circling, howling, four times, and  shouting reached his bed. With pleasure he felt all directions thud. The  east echoed.    In the sunset direction was Black Kangaroo Mouse, an expert robber. To  him I sent my cry. He was friendly to me and came hidden in black  darkness, sitting down four times upon his way. Magic fire covered the  edges of his trail. When he reached me he looked in all directions. The  magic trail brightly lay before him. He threw black darkness around him  and slowly reached the enemy, sitting down four times upon the trail. He  found a bag of the enemy, with much prized possessions. It was tied one  knot on top of another, but he bit them off. He took from it the blue  necklaces, blue earrings, and the different belongings lying around  gathered up with him. Then he slowly took his way back on the magic  trail, with magic fire everywhere. Hidden in his yellow darkness, he  returned to me. He left the others at the council and in darkness took  his homeward way, resting four times. He sat on his bed and felt all  directions of the earth rustling in the darkness. Darkness lay all  around.    I called on Owl, the white blood-sucker. To him I sent my cry. He was  friendly and came down to me with four thin flys (sailing) on the way.  He looked in all directions. The magic trail brightly before him lay. He  flew, with four thin flys, toward the enemy. The mountain of their power  which stood in the land he bit off short. The springs he bit off, and  their very good dreams. The best bow strings and the straight-flying  reeds he grasped and cut very short. He bit off their flesh and made  holes in their bones. From the things gathered, he made a belt from a  bowstring. Then he returned. He came through the whitish mist of dawn in  four flights. The people held a council. Leaving them there, he after  four thin flys reached his bed in the gray dawn mist. Then in all  directions he heard the darkness rattling, as he lay there.          The Spirit Land  Gallinomero (Russian River, Cal.)    When the flames burn low on the funeral pyres of the Gallinomero, Indian  mourners gather up handfuls of ashes and scatter them high in air. Thus  the good mount up into the air, or go to the Happy Western Land beyond  the Big Water.    But the bad Indians go to an island in the Bitter Waters, an island  naked and barren and desolate, covered only with brine-spattered stone,  swept with cold winds and the biting sea-spray. Here they live always,  breaking stone upon one another, with no food but the broken stones and  no drink but the salt sea water.          Song of the Ghost Dance  Pai Ute (Kern River, Cal.)                   The snow lies there--ro-rani!                 The snow lies there--ro-rani!                 The snow lies there--ro-rani!                 The snow lies there--ro-rani!                      The Milky Way lies there.                      The Milky Way lies there.    \"This is one of the favorite songs of the Paiute Ghost dance.... It  must be remembered that the dance is held in the open air at night, with  the stars shining down on the wide-extending plain walled in by the  giant Sierras, fringed at the base with dark pines, and with their peaks  white with eternal snows. Under such circumstances this song of the snow  lying white upon the mountains, and the Milky Way stretching across the  clear sky, brings up to the Paiute the same patriotic home love that  comes from lyrics of singing birds and leafy trees and still waters to  the people of more favored regions.... The Milky Way is the road of  the dead to the spirit world.\""]]]
