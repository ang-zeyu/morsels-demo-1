All glass windows must be double glazed, or else in  the very cold weather they are quickly covered with a thick deposit of  frost from the condensation of the moisture inside the room, and then  they admit much less light than gut does. One of its unpleasant features  is the way the membrane snaps back and forth with a report like a pistol  whenever the door is opened and shut, but on the whole it is a very good  substitute for glass indeed.    [Sidenote: SLEEPING CUSTOMS]    These river Esquimaux vary greatly in physical appearance. While many of  them are somewhat undersized and all have small feet and hands, some are  well-developed specimens of manhood. \"Riley Jim,\" the chief of this  tribe, would be counted a tall, stalwart man anywhere. And while many  have coarse, squat features, here and there is one who is decidedly  attractive in appearance. A sweet smile which is often upon the face,  and small, regular white teeth, greatly help to redeem any countenance.  A youth of about eighteen at the Squirrel River would properly be called  handsome, one thinks--though amongst native people one grows a little  afraid of forgetting standards of comparison; and his wife--for he was  already a husband--was a decidedly pretty girl. A word ought to be said  which applies to all the Esquimaux we met. Although many people live in  one hut and there is no possible privacy, yet we saw no immodesty of any  sort. They sleep entirely nude--probably our own great-grandparents did  the same, at least the people of Defoe and Smollet did, for nightshirts  and pyjamas are very modern things. There is much to be said from an  hygienic point of view in favour of that custom as against turning in  \"all standing\" as the Indian generally does, or sleeping in the day  underwear as most white men do. But although every one of a dozen people  in cabin after cabin that we stayed at on the Kobuk River above and  below this place, of both sexes and all ages, would thus strip  completely and go to bed, there was never any exposure of the body at  all. It may be, of course, that our presence imposed a greater care in  this respect, but it did not so impress us; it seemed the normal thing.  Another noticeable feature of the lives of all these people was their  devoutness in the matter of thanks before and after meat. Some of them  would not so much as give and receive a drink of cold water without a  long responsive grace.    As we went on down the river the country grew bleaker and drearier and  the few scattered inhabitants were living more and more the life of the  seacoast. The dwellings resembled igloos more than cabins, being  completely covered with snow and approached by underground passages,  with heavy flaps of untanned sealskin to close them. When we passed a  fork of the river we knew that we were entering the delta of the Kobuk,  and that another day would take us to the mission on Kotzebue Sound. It  was a long, hard day, in which we made forty miles, but an interesting  one. With a start at six, we were at the mouth by nine-thirty. The  spruce which had for some time been dwarfing and dwindling gave place to  willows, the willows shrank to shrubs, the shrubs changed to coarse  grass thrusting yellow tassels through the snow. The river banks sank  and flattened out and ceased, and we were on Hotham Inlet with the long  coast-line of the peninsula that forms it stretching away north and  south in the distance. Roxy's bewilderment was amusing. He stopped and  gazed about him and said: \"Kobuk River all pechuk!\" (\"Pechuk\" means  \"played out.\") \"What's the matter, no more Kobuk River?\" I think his  mind had never really entertained the notion of the river ending, though  of course he must often have heard of its mouth in the salt water. He  was out of his country, his bearings all gone, a feeling of helpless  insecurity taking the place of his usual confidence, and I think he said  no more all that day.    We had to traverse the ice of Hotham Inlet northward to its mouth,  double the end of the peninsula, and then travel south along the coast  to the mission at Kikitaruk, the peninsula being too rugged to cross.  Three considerable rivers drain into Hotham Inlet, roughly parallel in  their east and west courses, the Noatak, the Kobuk, and the Selawik, so  that its waters must be commonly more fresh than salt, for its bounds  are narrow and the extensive delta of its eastern shore would argue its  depth slight. Ahead of us, as we travelled north making a bee-line for  the end of the peninsula, all the afternoon, loomed the rocky promontory  of Krusenstern, one of Kotzebue's capes, and far beyond, stretching up  the dim coast-line, lay the way to Point Hope. It was with a sinking of  the heart that I gazed upon it, for I knew already, though I had not  announced a decision, that the road to Point Hope could not be my road  that year. All day long the thermometer stood between -40 deg. and -30 deg., and  the constant light sea-breeze kept scarfs wrapped closely about mouths  and noses, which always means disagreeable travel. When the company  stopped at noon to eat a little frozen lunch, I was too chilly to cease  my movement and pressed on. The day of that blessed comfort of the  trail, the thermos flask, was not yet. By two-thirty we had reached Pipe  Spit, which still further contracts the narrow entrance of the inlet,  and turning west for a mile or two rounded the point and then turned  south for ten miles along the coast. Just about dark we reached the  mission and stood gazing out over the rough ice of Kotzebue Sound to the  Arctic Ocean, having made the forty miles in ten and a half hours. We  had come about one thousand miles from Fairbanks, all of it on foot and  most of it on snow-shoes.    [Sidenote: THE ARCTIC OCEAN]    So here was my first sight of the Arctic Ocean. All day long I had  anticipated it, and it stirred me,--a dim, grey expanse stretching vast  and vague in the dusk of the evening. The old navigators whose stories I  had read as a boy passed before me in their wonderful, bold sailing  vessels, going in and out uncharted waters that steamships will not  venture to-day--Kotzebue, Beechey, Collinson, McClure--pushing  resolutely northward.    Less happy had been my first sight of the Pacific Ocean, five years  before. I had the ill luck to come upon it by way of that Western Coney  Island, Santa Monica, and from the merry-go-rounds and cheap eating  places Balboa and Magellan and Franky Drake fled away incontinent and  would not be conjured back; though, indeed, the original discoverers  would have had yet further occasion to gaze at one another \"with a wild  surmise\" if they had seen shrieking companies \"shooting the chutes.\" But  here was vastness, here was desolation, here was silence; jagged ice  masses in the foreground and boundless expanse beyond, solemn and  mysterious. The Arctic Ocean was even as I had pictured it.    The missionary in charge at Kikitaruk had been informed by letter of our  projected journey during the previous summer and had long expected us.  We were received with kindness and hospitality, and after supper began  at once our acquaintance with his work, for there was a service that  night which it was thought we should attend. I spoke for a few minutes  through an excellent interpreter and then spent a couple of hours  nodding over the stove, overcome with sleep, while there was much  singing and \"testimony.\"    [Sidenote: TOTAL-ABSTINENCE ESQUIMAUX]    The Californian Society of Friends, established here a number of years  with branches at other points on Kotzebue Sound, has done an excellent  work amongst the Esquimaux. If they had accomplished nothing else it  would stand to the everlasting credit of the Society's missionaries that  they have succeeded in imbuing the natives under their charge with a  total aversion to all intoxicating liquor. We had come down from the  remotest points to which the influence of these people has extended; we  had met their natives five hundred miles away from their base of  instruction, and everywhere we found the same thing. It was said by the  white men on the Koyukuk that a Kobuk could not be induced to take a  drink of whisky. It seemed to us a pity that the force of this most  wholesome doctrine should be weakened by the unsuccessful attempt to  include tobacco in the same rigorous prohibition. In several cabins  where we stayed there was no sign of smoking until members of our party  produced pipes, whereupon other pipes were furtively produced and the  tobacco that was offered was eagerly accepted. From any rational point  of view the putting of whisky and tobacco in the same category is surely  a folly. There can be few more harmless indulgences to the native than  his pipe, and no one knows the solace of the pipe until he has smoked it  around the camp-fire in the arctic regions after a hard day's journey.    The decision to turn my back on Point Hope was, I think, the most  painful decision I ever made in my life; with all my heart I wanted to  go on. It was only one hundred and sixty or one hundred and seventy  miles away. The journey had been made in three or four days; but we  were now come to a country where travel is impossible in bad weather and  where bad weather prevails; and that journey might quite as likely take  two weeks. I worked over the calendar in my diary, figuring how many  days of travel still remained, allowing reasonable margins, and I could  not see that I had much more than time to get back to Fairbanks before  the break-up, which for sufficient reason I regarded as my first duty.  The day of rest at Kikitaruk was Washington's birthday, the 22d of  February. Eight weeks would bring us to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22976"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#18)"],[1,"an' we moved ter Raliegh.

I ain't never  forgot dat.    My mammy an' pappy, Silo an' Fanny Moss belonged to Marse Jordan an'  Mis' Sally Moss. Dey had 'bout three hundred niggahs an' mos' of dem  worked in de cotton fields.    Marse Jordan wuz hard on his niggahs. He worked dem over time an' didn'  give den enough to eat. Dey didn' have good clothes neither an' dey  shoes wuz made out of wood. He had 'bout a dozen niggahs dat didn' do  nothin' else but make wooden shoes for de slaves. De chillun didn' have  no shoes a tall; dey went barefooted in de snow an' ice same as 'twuz  summer time. I never had no shoes on my feets 'twell I wuz pas' ten  years ole, an' dat wuz after de Yankees done set us free.    I wuz skeered of Marse Jordan, an' all of de grown niggahs wuz too 'cept  Leonard an' Burrus Allen. Dem niggahs wuzn' skeered of nothin'. If de  debil hese'f had come an' shook er stick at dem dey'd hit him back.  Leonard wuz er big black buck niggah; he wuz de bigges niggah I ever  seed, an' Burrus wuz near 'bout as big, an' dey 'spized Marse Jordan  wus'n pizen.    I wuz sort of skeered of Mis' Polly too. When Marse Jordan wuzn' 'roun'  she wuz sweet an' kind, but when he wuz 'roun', she wuz er yes, suh,  yes, suh, woman. Everythin' he tole her to do she done. He made her slap  Marmy one time kaze when she passed his coffee she spilled some in de  saucer. Mis' Sally hit Mammy easy, but Marse Jordan say: 'Hit her,  Sally, hit de black bitch like she 'zerve to be hit.' Den Mis' Sally  draw back her hand an' hit Mammy in de face, pow, den she went back to  her place at de table an' play like she eatin' her breakfas'. Den when  Marse Jordan leave she come in de kitchen an' put her arms 'roun' Mammy  an' cry, an' Mammy pat her on de back an' she cry too. I loved Mis'  Sally when Marse Jordan wuzn' 'roun'.    Marse Jordan's two sons went to de war; dey went all dressed up in dey  fightin' clothes. Young Marse Jordan wuz jus' like Mis' Sally but Marse  Gregory wuz like Marse Jordan, even to de bully way he walk. Young Marse  Jordan never come back from de war, but 'twould take more den er bullet  to kill Marse Gregory; he too mean to die anyhow kaze de debil didn'  want him an' de Lawd wouldn' have him.    One day Marse Gregory come home on er furlo'. He think he look pretty  wid his sword clankin' an' his boots shinin'. He wuz er colonel,  lootenent er somethin'. He wuz struttin' 'roun' de yard showin' off,  when Leonard Allen say under his breath, 'Look at dat God damn sojer. He  fightin' to keep us niggahs from bein' free.'    'Bout dat time Marse Jordan come up. He look at Leonard an' say: 'What  yo' mumblin' 'bout?'    Dat big Leonard wuzn' skeered. He say, I say, 'Look at dat God damn  sojer. He fightin' to keep us niggahs from bein' free.'    Marse Jordan's face begun to swell. It turned so red dat de blood near  'bout bust out. He turned to Pappy an' tole him to go an' bring him dis  shot gun. When Pappy come back Mis' Sally come wid him. De tears wuz  streamin' down her face. She run up to Marse Jordan an' caught his arm.  Ole Marse flung her off an' took de gun from Pappy. He leveled it on  Leonard an' tole him to pull his shirt open. Leonard opened his shirt  an' stood dare big as er black giant sneerin' at Ole Marse.    Den Mis' Sally run up again an' stood 'tween dat gun an' Leonard.    Ole Marse yell to pappy an' tole him to take dat woman out of de way,  but nobody ain't moved to touch Mis' Sally, an' she didn' move neither,  she jus' stood dare facin' Ole Marse. Den Ole Marse let down de gun. He  reached over an' slapped Mis' Sally down, den picked up de gun an' shot  er hole in Leonard's ches' big as yo' fis'. Den he took up Mis' Sally  an' toted her in de house. But I wuz so skeered dat I run an' hid in de  stable loft, an' even wid my eyes shut I could see Leonard layin' on de  groun' wid dat bloody hole in his ches' an' dat sneer on his black mouf.    After dat Leonard's brother Burrus hated Ole Marse wus' er snake, den  one night he run away. Mammy say he run away to keep from killin' Ole  Marse. Anyhow, when Ole Marse foun' he wuz gone, he took er bunch of  niggahs an' set out to find him. All day long dey tromped de woods, den  when night come dey lit fat pine to'ches an' kept lookin', but dey  couldn' find Burrus. De nex' day Ole Marse went down to de county jail  an' got de blood houn's. He brung home er great passel of dem yelpin'  an' pullin' at de ropes, but when he turned dem loose dey didn' find  Burrus, kaze he done grease de bottom of his feets wid snuff an' hog  lard so de dogs couldn' smell de trail. Ole Marse den tole all de  niggahs dat if anybody housed an' fed Burrus on de sly, dat he goin' to  shoot dem like he done shot Leonard. Den he went every day an' searched  de cabins; he even looked under de houses.    One day in 'bout er week Mis' Sally wuz feedin' de chickens when she  heard somethin' in de polk berry bushes behin' de hen house. She didn'  go 'roun' de house but she went inside house an' looked through de  crack. Dare wuz Burrus layin' down in de bushes. He wuz near 'bout  starved kaze he hadn' had nothin' to eat since he done run away.    Mis' Sally whisper an' tole him to lay still, dat she goin' to slip him  somethin' to eat. She went back to de house an' made up some more cawn  meal dough for de chickens, an' under de dough she put some bread an'  meat. When she went 'cross de yard she met Marse Jordan. He took de pan  of dough an' say he goin' to feed de chickens. My mammy say dat Mis'  Sally ain't showed no skeer, she jus' smile at Ole Marse an' pat his  arm, den while she talk she take de pan an' go on to de chicken house,  but Ole Marse he go too. When dey got to de hen house Ole Marse puppy  begun sniffin' 'roun'. Soon he sta'ted to bark; he cut up such er fuss  dat Ole Marse went to see what wuz wrong. Den he foun' Burrus layin' in  de polk bushes.    Ole Marse drag Burrus out an' drove him to de house. When Mis' Sally  seed him take out his plaited whip, she run up stairs an' jump in de bed  an' stuff er pillow over her head.    Dey took Burrus to de whippin' post. Dey strip off his shirt, den dey  put his head an' hands through de holes in de top, an' tied his feets to  de bottom, den, Ole Marse took de whip. Dat lash hiss like col' water on  er red hot iron when it come through de air, an' every time it hit  Burrus it lef' er streak of blood. Time Ole Marse finish, Burrus' back  look like er piece of raw beef.    Dey laid Burrus face down on er plank den dey poured turpentine in all  dem cut places. It burned like fire but dat niggah didn' know nothin'  'bout it kaze he done passed out from pain. But, all his life dat black  man toted dem scares on his back.    When de war ended Mis' Sally come to Mammy an' say: 'Fanny, I's sho glad  yo's free. Yo' can go now an' yo' won' ever have to be er slave no  more.'    But Mammy, she ain't had no notion of leavin' Mis' Sally. She put her  arms' roun' her an' call her Baby, an' tell her she goin' to stay wid  her long as she live. An' she did stay wid her. Me an' Mammy bof stayed  Mis' Sally 'twell she died.          N. C. District: No. 3                   [320193]  Field Worker:   Esther S. Pinnix  Word Total:     3,199  Editor:         P. G.

Three miles north of  Bethania, the second oldest settlement of the \"Unitas Fratrum\" in  Wachovia, lies the 1500 acre Jones plantation. It has been owned for  several generations by the one family, descendants of Abraham Conrad.  Conrad's daughter, Julia, married a physician of note, Dr. Beverly  Jones, whose family occupied the old homestead at the time of the Civil  War.    Here, in 1856, was born a negro girl, Betty, to a slave mother. Here,  today, under the friendly protection of this same Jones family,  surrounded by her sons and her sons' sons, lives this same Betty in her  own little weather-stained cottage. Encircling her house are lilacs,  althea, and flowering trees that soften the bleak outlines of unpainted  out-buildings.
