[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2750"],[0,"Joan of Naples (#18)"],[1,"was the same kindness on the king's part, the same  affection shown to the children, the same invitation to supper. The  banquet was magnificent; the room was brilliantly lighted, and the  reflections were dazzling: vessels of gold shone on the table; the  intoxicating perfume of flowers filled the air; wine foamed in the  goblets and flowed from the flagons in ruby streams; conversation,  excited and discursive, was heard on every side; all faces beamed with  joy.    Charles of Durazzo sat opposite the king, at a separate table among his  brothers. Little by little his look grew fixed, his brow pensive. He was  fancying that Andre might have supped in this very hall on the eve of  his tragic end, and he thought how all concerned in that death had  either died in torment or were now languishing in prison; the queen, an  exile and a fugitive, was begging pity from strangers: he alone was  free. The thought made him tremble; but admiring his own cleverness in  pursuing his infernal schemes, and putting away his sad looks, he smiled  again with an expression of indefinable pride. The madman at this moment  was scoffing at the justice of God. But Lello of Aquila, who was waiting  at the table, bent down, whispering gloomily--    \"Unhappy duke, why did you refuse to believe me? Fly, while there is yet  time.\"    Charles, angered by the man's obstinacy, threatened that if he were such  a fool as to say any more, he would repeat every word aloud.    \"I have done my duty,\" murmured Lello, bowing his head; \"now it must  happen as God wills.\"    As he left off speaking, the king rose, and as the duke went up to take  his leave, his face suddenly changed, and he cried in an awful voice--    \"Traitor! At length you are in my hands, and you shall die as you  deserve; but before you are handed over to the executioner, confess with  your own lips your deeds of treachery towards our royal majesty: so  shall we need no other witness to condemn you to a punishment  proportioned to your crimes. Between our two selves, Duke of Durazzo,  tell me first why, by your infamous manoeuvring, you aided your uncle,  the Cardinal of Perigord, to hinder the coronation of my brother, and so  led him on, since he had no royal prerogative of his own, to his  miserable end? Oh, make no attempt to deny it. Here is the letter sealed  with your seal; in secret you wrote it, but it accuses you in public.  Then why, after bringing us hither to avenge our brother's death, of  which you beyond all doubt were the cause,--why did you suddenly turn to  the queen's party and march against our town of Aquila, daring to raise  an army against our faithful subjects? You hoped, traitor, to make use  of us as a footstool to mount the throne withal, as soon as you were  free from every other rival. Then you would but have awaited our  departure to kill the viceroy we should have left in our place, and so  seize the kingdom. But this time your foresight has been at fault. There  is yet another crime worse than all the rest, a crime of high treason,  which I shall remorselessly punish. You carried off the bride that our  ancestor King Robert designed for me, as you knew, by his will. Answer,  wretch what excuse can you make for the rape of the Princess Marie?\"    Anger had so changed Louis's voice that the last words sounded like the  roar of a wild beast: his eyes glittered with a feverish light, his lips  were pale and trembling. Charles and his brothers fell upon their knees,  frozen by mortal terror, and the unhappy duke twice tried to speak, but  his teeth were chattering so violently that he could not articulate a  single word. At last, casting his eyes about him and seeing his poor  brothers, innocent and ruined by his fault, he regained some sort of  courage, and said--    \"My lord, you look upon me with a terrible countenance that makes me  tremble. But on my knees I entreat you, have mercy on me if I have done  wrong, for God is my witness that I did not call you to this kingdom  with any criminal intention: I have always desired, and still desire,  your supremacy in all the sincerity of my soul. Some treacherous  counsellors, I am certain, have contrived to draw down your hatred upon  me. If it is true, as you say, that I went with an armed force to Aquila  I was compelled by Queen Joan, and I could not do otherwise; but as soon  as I heard of your arrival at Fermo I took my troops away again. I hope  for the love of Christ I may obtain your mercy and pardon, by reason of  my former services and constant loyalty. But as I see you are now angry  with me, I say no more waiting for your fury to pass over. Once again,  my lord, have pity upon us, since we are in the hands of your Majesty.\"    The king turned away his head, and retired slowly, confiding the  prisoners to the care of Stephen Vayvoda and the Count of Zornic, who  guarded them during the night in a room adjoining the king's chamber.  The next day Louis held another meeting of his council, and ordered that  Charles should have his throat cut on the very spot where poor Andre had  been hanged. He then sent the other princes of the blood, loaded with  chains, to Hungary, where they were long kept prisoners. Charles, quite  thunderstruck by such an unexpected blow, overwhelmed by the thought of  his past crimes, trembled like a coward face to face with death, and  seemed completely crushed. Bowed, upon his knees, his face half hidden  in his hands, from time to time convulsive sobs escaped him, as he tried  to fix the thoughts that chased each other through his mind like the  shapes of a monstrous dream. Night was in his soul, but every now and  then light flashed across the darkness, and over the gloomy background  of his despair passed gilded figures fleeing from him with smiles of  mockery. In his ears buzzed voices from the other world; he saw a long  procession of ghosts, like the conspirators whom Nicholas of Melazzo had  pointed out in the vaults of Castel Nuovo. But these phantoms each held  his head in his hand, and shaking it by the hair, bespattered him with  drops of blood. Some brandished whips, some knives: each threatened  Charles with his instrument of torture. Pursued by the nocturnal train,  the hapless man opened his mouth for one mighty cry, but his breath was  gone, and it died upon his lips. Then he beheld his mother stretching  out her arms from afar, and he fancied that if he could but reach her he  would be safe. But at each step the path grew more and more narrow,  pieces of his flesh were torn off by the approaching walls; at last,  breathless, naked and bleeding, he reached his goal; but his mother  glided farther away, and it was all to begin over again. The phantoms  pursued him, grinning and screaming in his ears:--    \"Cursed be he who slayeth his mother!\"    Charles was roused from these horrors by the cries of his brothers, who  had come to embrace him for the last time before embarking. The duke in  a low voice asked their pardon, and then fell back into his state of  despair. The children were dragged away, begging to be allowed to share  their brother's fate, and crying for death as an alleviation of their  woes. At length they were separated, but the sound of their lamentation  sounded long in the heart of the condemned man. After a few moments, two  soldiers and two equerries came to tell the duke that his hour had come.    Charles followed them, unresisting, to the fatal balcony where Andre had  been hanged. He was there asked if he desired to confess, and when he  said yes, they brought a monk from the sane convent where the terrible  scene had been enacted: he listened to the confession of all his sins,  and granted him absolution. The duke at once rose and walked to the  place where Andre had been thrown down for the cord to be put round his  neck, and there, kneeling again, he asked his executioners--    \"Friends, in pity tell me, is there any hope for my life?\"    And when they answered no, Charles exclaimed:    \"Then carry out your instructions.\"    At these words, one of the equerries plunged his sword into his breast,  and the other cut his head off with a knife, and his corpse was thrown  over the balcony into the garden where Andre's body had lain for three  days unburied.          CHAPTER VII      The King of Hungary, his black flag ever borne before him, started for  Naples, refusing all offered honours, and rejecting the canopy beneath  which he was to make his entry, not even stopping to give audience to  the chief citizens or to receive the acclamations of the crowd. Armed at  all points, he made for Castel Nuovo, leaving behind him dismay and  fear. His first act on entering the city was to order Dona Cancha to be  burnt, her punishment having been deferred by reason of her pregnancy.  Like the others, she was drawn on a cart to the square of St. Eligius,  and there consigned to the flames. The young creature, whose suffering  had not impaired her beauty, was dressed as for a festival, and laughing  like a mad thing up to the last moment, mocked at her executioners and  threw kisses to the crowd.    A few days later, Godfrey of Marsana, Count of Squillace and grand  admiral of the kingdom, was arrested by the king's orders. His life was  promised him on condition of his delivering up Conrad of Catanzaro, one  of his relatives, accused of conspiring against Andre. The grand admiral  committed this act of shameless treachery, and did not shrink from  sending his own son to persuade Conrad to come to the town. The poor  wretch was given over to the king, and tortured alive on a wheel made  with sharp knives. The sight of these barbarities, far from calming the  king's rage, seemed to inflame it the more. Every day there were new  accusations and new sentences. The prisons were crowded: Louis's  punishments were redoubled in severity. A fear arose that the town, and  indeed the whole kingdom, were to be treated as having taken part in  Andre's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27509"],[0,"The 2006 CIA World Factbook (#18)"],[1," Pakistan have been repatriated, but    thousands still remain in Iran, many at their own choosing;    Coalition and Pakistani forces continue to patrol remote tribal    areas to control the borders and stem organized terrorist and other    illegal cross-border activities; regular meetings between Pakistani    and Coalition allies aim to resolve periodic claims of boundary    encroachments; regional conflicts over water-sharing arrangements    with Amu Darya and Helmand River states    Refugees and internally displaced persons:    IDPs: 200,000-300,000 (mostly Pashtuns and Kuchis displaced in    south and west due to drought and instability) (2005)    Illicit drugs:    world's largest producer of opium; cultivation dropped 48% to    107,400 hectares in 2005; better weather and lack of widespread    disease returned opium yields to normal levels, meaning potential    opium production declined by only 10% to 4,475 metric tons; if the    entire poppy crop were processed, it is estimated that 526 metric    tons of heroin could be processed; source of hashish; many    narcotics-processing labs throughout the country; drug trade source    of instability and some antigovernment groups profit from the trade;    80-90% of the heroin consumed in Europe comes from Afghan opium;    vulnerable to narcotics money laundering through informal financial    networks      This page was last updated on 19 December, 2006            ======================================================================          @Akrotiri    Introduction Akrotiri      Background:    By terms of the 1960 Treaty of Establishment that created the    independent Republic of Cyprus, the UK retained full sovereignty and    jurisdiction over two areas of almost 254 square kilometers -    Akrotiri and Dhekelia.

The    transition has proven challenging as successive governments have    tried to deal with high unemployment, widespread corruption, a    dilapidated physical infrastructure, powerful organized crime    networks, and combative political opponents. Albania has made    progress in its democratic development since first holding    multiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies remain. International    observers judged elections to be largely free and fair since the    restoration of political stability following the collapse of pyramid    schemes in 1997. In the 2005 general elections, the Democratic Party    and its allies won a decisive victory on pledges of reducing crime    and corruption, promoting economic growth, and decreasing the size    of government. The election, and particularly the orderly transition    of power, was considered an important step forward. Although    Albania's economy continues to grow, the country is still one of the    poorest in Europe, hampered by a large informal economy and an    inadequate energy and transportation infrastructure. Albania has    played a largely helpful role in managing inter-ethnic tensions in    southeastern Europe, and is continuing to work toward joining NATO    and the EU. Albania, with troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been a    strong supporter of the global war on terrorism.
