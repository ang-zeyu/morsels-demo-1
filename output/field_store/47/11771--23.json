The question dividing  them was this: In matters relating to the powers of the general  Government, ought any unclear utterance of the Constitution to be so  explained as to enlarge those powers, or so as to confine them to the  narrowest possible sphere? Each of the two tendencies in construction  has in turn brought violence to our fundamental law, but the sentiment  of nationality and the logic of events have favored liberality rather  than narrowness in interpreting the parchment. When in charge of the  government, even strict constructionists have not been able to carry out  their theory. Thus Jefferson, to purchase Louisiana, was obliged, from  his point of view, to transcend constitutional warrant; and Madison, who  at first opposed such an institution as unconstitutional, ended by  approving the law which chartered the Second United States Bank.    The Federalists used to argue that Article I, Section VIII., the part of  the Constitution upon which debate chiefly raged, could not have been  intended as an exhaustive statement of congressional powers. The  Government would be unable to exist, they urged, to say nothing of  defending itself and accomplishing its work, unless permitted to do more  than the eighteen things there enumerated. They further insisted that  plain utterances of the Constitution presuppose the exercise by Congress  of powers not specifically enumerated, explicitly authorizing that body  to make all laws necessary for executing the enumerated powers \"and all  other powers vested in the Government of the United States or in any  department or officer thereof.\"    In reply the Anti-Federalists made much of the titles \"United States,\"  \"Federal,\" and the like, in universal use. They appealed to concessions  as to the nature of our system made by statesmen of known national  sympathies. Such concessions were plentiful then and much later. Even  Webster in his immortal reply to Hayne calls ours a government of  \"strictly limited,\" even of \"enumerated, specified, and particularized\"  powers. Two historical facts told powerfully for the anti-federalist  theory. One was that the government previous to 1789 was unquestionably  a league of States; the other was that many voted for the present  Constitution supposing it to be a mere revision of the old. Had the  reverse been commonly believed, adoption would have been more than  doubtful.        CHAPTER III.    DOMESTIC QUESTIONS OF WASHINGTON'S ADMINISTRATIONS    [1790-1791]    I. Tariff.--Upon declaring their independence the United States threw  open their ports, inviting trade from all nations. During the Revolution  foreign commerce had become an important interest, and at its close the  inclination of all, the more so from memory of England's accursed  navigation acts, would have been to leave it untrammelled. Several  motives, however, induced resort to a restrictive policy which,  beginning with 1789, and for years expected to be temporary, has been  pursued with little deviation ever since. Of course the Government  needed revenue, and the readiest means of securing this was a tax on  imports. Rates were made low, averaging until 1808 only 11-1/4 per cent.  As a consequence the revenues were large.    The movers of this first tariff, especially Hamilton, also wished by  means of it to make the central Government felt as a positive power  throughout the land. It had this effect. All custom-houses passed to the  United States, and United States officers appeared at every port, having  an authority, in its kind, paramount to that of state functionaries.    A stronger consideration still was to retaliate against England. In  spite of America's political independence the old country was determined  to retain for her merchant marine its former monopoly here. Orders in  council practically limited all the commerce of England and her  remaining colonies with this country to English ships, although, from  the relations of the two lands and the nature of their productions, our  chief foreign trade must still be with England. There was no way to meet  this selfish policy but to show that it was a game which we too could  play.    Besides, however we behaved toward the mother-land, we needed to be  prepared for war, because it was evident that George III. and his  ministers had only too good a will to reduce us again to subjection if  opportunity offered. Should we, by taxing imports, become independent in  the production of war material, a fresh struggle for life would be much  more hopeful than if we continued dependent upon foreign lands for  military supplies.    II. Funding the Debt.--In the first years after they had set up their  new constitution the people of this country staggered under a terrible  financial load. Besides the current expenses of Government, there were:  1, the federal debt due abroad, over thirteen million dollars, including  arrears; 2, the federal debt held at home, about forty-two and one-half  million; 3, the state revolutionary debts, aggregating nearly  twenty-five million. Each of these sums was largely made up of unpaid  interest.    The foreign debt Congress unanimously determined to pay in full. In  respect to the domestic federal debt two opinions prevailed. Hamilton  was for liquidating this also to the last copper. But these securities  had mostly changed hands since issue, so that dollar for dollar payment  would not advantage original holders but only speculators. As soon as  Hamilton's recommendation became public this class of paper rose from  about fifteen cents per dollar to fifty cents, and enterprising New York  firms hurried their couriers, relay horses, and swift packets to remote  parts of the Union to buy it up. Madison, supported by a strong party,  proposed, therefore, to pay only original debtors at par, allowing  secondary holders barely the highest market value previous to the  opening of the question in Congress. He was overruled, however, and this  part of the debt, too, was ordered paid according to its literal terms.    Even the motion that the United States should assume and discharge the  state debts finally prevailed, though against most violent and resolute  opposition. This came especially from Virginia, who had gone far in the  payment of her own war debt, and thought it unjust to have to help the  delinquent States. Her objection was strengthened by the fact that most  of the debt was owned in the North. The victory was secured by what is  now termed a \"deal,\" northern votes being promised in favor of a  southern location for the national capital, in return for enough  southern votes to pass the bill assuming state debts.    These gigantic measures had origin in the mind of Hamilton. To many they  appeared and appear today like a grand government job. But they worked  well, laying the foundation of our national credit. Interest arrears and  back installments of the foreign debt were to be paid at once with the  proceeds of a fresh loan, supplemented by income from customs and  tonnage. The remaining debt was to be refunded. Federal stocks shot up  in value, moneyed interests became attached to the Government, and the  nation began to be looked to as a more reliable bulwark of sound finance  than any of the States.

The Excise.--Unexpectedly productive as the tariff had proved,  public income still fell short of what these vast operations required.  Direct taxation or a higher tariff being out of the question, Hamilton  proposed, and Congress voted, an excise on spirits, from nine to  twenty-five cents a gallon if from grain, from eleven to thirty if from  imported material, as molasses. Excise was a hated form of tax, and this  measure awakened great opposition in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,  and New England, and most of all in Pennsylvania, in whose western  counties distilling was the staple industry.    Here, far from the seats of power, even the state government had  asserted itself little. The general Government was defied. A meeting in  Washington County voted to regard as an enemy any person taking office  under the excise law. September 6, 1791, a revenue officer was tarred  and feathered. Other such cases followed. Secret societies were formed  to oppose the law. Whippings and even murders resulted. At last there  was a veritable reign of terror. The President proceeded slowly but with  firmness, accounting this a good opportunity vividly to reveal to the  people the might of the new Government. Militia and volunteers were  called out, who arrived in the rebellious districts in November, 1794.  Happily, their presence sufficed. The opposition faded away before them,  not a shot being fired on either side.      [Illustration: Several men working with a large still.]  Illicit Distillers warned of the Approach of Revenue Officers.      IV. The Bank.--The Secretary of the Treasury pleaded for a United States  Bank as not only profitable to Government but indispensable to the  proper administration of the national finances. Congress acquiesced, yet  with so violent hostility on the part of many that before approving the  Charter Act Washington required the written opinions of his official  advisers. Jefferson powerfully opposed such an institution as  unconstitutional, his acute argument being the arsenal whence close  constructionists have gotten their weapons ever since. Randolph sided  with Jefferson, Knox with Hamilton. The President at last signed,  agreeing with Hamilton in the view that Congress, being the agent of a  sovereignty, is not, within any sphere of action constitutionally open  to it, shut up to specific or enumerated modes of attaining its ends,  but has choice among all those that nations customarily use.

Cousin and  brother-in-law had the \"love frenzy for France,\" which finally  culminated in celebrating the ninth anniversary of the treaty of  alliance between France and America, at which Brockholst became  proudly eloquent, and the Chancellor most happy in the felicity of an  historic toast: \"May the present coolness between France and America  produce, like the quarrels of lovers, a renewal of love.\"    Chancellor Livingston was now in the fifty-first year of his age, tall  and handsome, with an abundance of hair already turning gray, which  fell in ringlets over a square high forehead, lending a certain  dignity that made him appear as great in private life as he was when  gowned and throned in his important office.[82] In the estimation of  his contemporaries he was one of the most gifted men of his time, and  the judgment of a later age has not reversed their decision. He added  learning to great natural ability, and brilliancy to profound thought;  and although so deaf as to make communication with him difficult, he  nearly concealed the defect by his remarkable eloquence and  conversational gifts. Benjamin Franklin called him \"the Cicero of  America.\" His love for the beautiful attracted Edmund Burke. It is  doubtful if he had a superior in the State in the knowledge of  history and the classics, and in the study of science Samuel L.  Mitchill alone stood above him. He lacked the creative genius of  Hamilton, the prescient gifts of Jay, and the skill of Burr to marshal  men for selfish purposes, but he was at home in debate with the ablest  men of his time, a master of sarcasm, of trenchant wit, and of  felicitous rhetoric.    [Footnote 82: \"The tall and graceful figure of Chancellor Livingston,  and his polished wit and classical taste, contributed not a little to  deepen the impression resulting from the ingenuity of his argument,  the vivacity of his imagination, and the dignity of his  station.\"--Chancellor Kent's address before The Law Association of New  York, October 21, 1836. George Shea, _Life of Alexander Hamilton_,  Appendix.]    Livingston's candidacy for governor was clearly a dash for the  Presidency. He reasoned, as every ambitious New York statesman has  reasoned from that day to this, that if he could carry the State in an  off year, he would be needed in a presidential year. This reasoning  reduces the governorship to a sort of spring-board from which to vault  into the White House, and, although only one man in a century has  performed the feat, it has always figured as a popular and potent  factor in the settlement of political nominations. George Clinton  thought promotion would come to him, and Hamilton inspired Jay with a  similar notion, although it is doubtful if the people ever seriously  considered the candidacy of either; but Livingston, sanguine of better  treatment, was willing voluntarily to withdraw from the professional  path along which he had moved to great distinction, staking more than  he had a right to stake on success. In his reckoning, as the sequel  showed, he miscalculated the popularity of Jay as much as Hamilton did  that of George Clinton in 1789.    The Chancellor undoubtedly believed the tide of Federalism, which had  been steadily rising for six years, was about to ebb. There were  sporadic indications of it. Perhaps Livingston thought it had already  turned, since Republicans had recently won several significant  elections. Two years before DeWitt Clinton and his associates had  suffered defeat in a city which now returned four assemblymen and one  senator with an average Republican majority of more than one thousand.  This indicated that the constant talk of monarchical tendencies, of  Hamilton's centralising measures, and of the court customs introduced  by Washington and followed by Adams, was beginning to influence the  timid into voting with Republicans.    But counteracting influences were also at work, which Livingston, in  his zeal for political honours, possibly did not observe. New England  Federalists, attracted by the fertile valleys of the Hudson and the  Mohawk, had filled the western district, and were now holding it  faithful to the party of Jay and Hamilton. Just at this time, too,  Federalists were bound to be strengthened by the insulting treatment  of American envoys sent to France to restore friendly intercourse  between the two republics. President Adams' message, based upon their  correspondence, asserted that nothing could be accomplished \"on terms  compatible with the safety, honour, and essential interests of the  United States,\" and advised that immediate steps be taken for the  national defence. What the President had withheld for prudential  reasons, the public did not know; but it knew that the Cabinet  favoured an immediate declaration of war, and that the friends of the  Administration in Congress were preparing for such an event. This of  itself should have taken Livingston out of the gubernatorial contest;  for if war were declared before the April election, the result would  assuredly be as disastrous to him as the publication of Jay's treaty  in April, 1795, would have been hurtful to the Federalists. But  Chancellor Livingston, following the belief of his party that France  did not intend to go to war with America, accepted what he had been  seeking for months, and entered the campaign with high hopes.    Jay had intended retiring from public life at the close of his first  term as governor.[83] For a quarter of a century he had been looking  forward to a release from the cares of office, and to the quiet of his  country home in Westchester; but \"the indignities which France was at  that time heaping upon his country,\" says William Jay, his son and  biographer, \"and the probability that they would soon lead to war,  forbade him to consult his personal gratification.\"[84] On the 6th of  March, therefore, he accepted renomination on a ticket with Stephen  Van Rensselaer for lieutenant-governor.    [Footnote 83: William Jay, _Life of John Jay_, Vol. 1, p. 400.]    [Footnote 84: _Ibid._]    It is significant that the anti-Federalists failed to nominate a  lieutenant-governor on the ticket with Livingston. Stephen Van  Rensselaer was a Federalist of the old school, a brother-in-law of  Hamilton, and a vigorous supporter of his party. It is difficult to  accept the theory that none of his opponents wanted the place; it is  easier to believe that under existing conditions no one of sufficient  prominence cared to make the race, especially after President Adams  had published the correspondence of the American envoys, disclosing  Talleyrand's demand for $240,000 as a gift and $6,000,000 as a loan,  with the threat that in the event of failure to comply, \"steps will be  taken immediately to ravage the coast of the United States by French  frigates from St. Domingo.\" The display of such despicable greed,  coupled with the menace, acted very much as the fire of a file of  British soldiers did in Boston in 1770, and sent the indignant and  eloquent reply of Charles C. Pinckney, then minister to France,  ringing throughout the country--\"Millions for defence, but not a cent  for tribute.\" Within four weeks Congress authorised the establishment  of a navy department, the construction of ten war vessels, the  recapture of American ships unlawfully seized, the purchase of cannon,  arms, and military stores, and the raising of a provisional army of  ten thousand, with the acceptance of militia volunteers. The French  tri-colour gave place to the black cockade, a symbol of patriotism in  Revolutionary days, and \"Hail Columbia,\" then first published and set  to the \"President's March,\" was sung to the wildest delight of  American audiences in theatres and churches.    In the midst of this excitement occurred the election for governor.  The outcome was a decided change, sending Jay's majority up to  2380.[85] It is not easy to estimate how much of this result was  influenced by the rising war cloud, and how much is to be credited to  the individuality of the candidates. Both probably entered into the  equation. But the fact that Jay carried legislative districts in which  Republicans sent DeWitt Clinton and Ambrose Spencer to the Senate,  would indicate that confidence in Jay, if not dislike of Livingston,  had been the principal factor in this sweeping victory. \"The result of  this election terminated, as was foreseen,\" wrote William P. Van Ness,  four years later, \"in the defeat and mortification of Mr. Livingston,  and confirmed the conviction of the party, that the people had no  confidence in his political integrity, and had been disgusted by his  unwarrantable expectations. His want of popularity was so well known  that nothing could have induced this inexpedient measure, but a desire  to show the futility of his pretensions, and thus in future avoid his  hitherto unceasing importunities.\"[86]    [Footnote 85: John Jay, 16,012; Robert Livingston, 13,632. _Civil  List, State of New York_, (1887), p. 1166.]    [Footnote 86: William P. Van Ness, _Examination of Charges against  Aaron Burr_, p. 12.]    Livingston's search for distinction in the political field seems to  have resulted in unhappiness. The distinguished ability displayed as  chancellor followed him to the end, but the joy of public life  vanished when he entered the domain of partisan politics. Had he  possessed those qualities of leadership that bind party and friends by  ties of unflinching services, he might have reaped the reward his  ambition so ardently craved; but his peculiar temper unfitted him for  such a career. Jealous, fretful, sensitive, and suspicious, he was as  restless as his"]]]
