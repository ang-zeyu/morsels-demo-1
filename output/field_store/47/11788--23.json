These can corrupt the air, and cause sickness, plagues,  storms, shipwrecks, fires, inundations.... Nothing so familiar  (if we may believe those relations of Saxo Grammaticus, Olaus  Magnus, &c.) as for witches and sorcerers in Lapland, Lithuania,  and all over Scandia to sell winds to mariners and cause  tempests, which Marcus Paulus, the Venetian, relates likewise of  the Tartars.[78]      [78] It is still the custom of the Tartar or Thibetian    Lamas, or at least of some of them, to scatter charms to the    winds for the benefit of travellers. M. Huc's _Travels in    Tartary, Thibet, &c._    'These are they which Cardan thinks desire so much carnal  copulation with witches (Incubi and Succubi), transform bodies,  and are so very cold if they be touched, and that serve  magicians.... Water devils are those naiads or water nymphs which  have been heretofore conversant about waters and rivers. The  water (as Paracelsus thinks) is their chaos, wherein they live  ... appearing most part (saith Trithemius) in women's shapes.  Paracelsus hath several stories of them that have lived and been  married to mortal men, and so continued for certain years with  them, and after, upon some dislike, have forsaken them. Such an  one was Egeria, with whom Numa was so familiar, Diana, Ceres,  &c.... Terrestrial devils are Lares, Genii, Fauns, Satyrs,  Wood-nymphs, Foliots, Fairies, Robin Goodfellows, Trulli; which,  as they are most conversant with men, so they do them most harm.  Some think it was they alone that kept the heathen people in awe  of old.... Subterranean devils are as common as the rest, and do  as much harm. Olaus Magnus makes six kinds of them, some bigger,  some less, commonly seen about mines of metals, and are some of  them noxious; some again do no harm (they are guardians of  treasure in the earth, and cause earthquakes). The last (sort)  are conversant about the centre of the earth, to torture the  souls of damned men to the day of judgment; their egress and  ingress some suppose to be about AEtna, Lipari, Hecla, Vesuvius,  Terra del Fuego, because many shrieks and fearful cries are  continually heard thereabouts, and familiar apparitions of dead  men, ghosts, and goblins.'    As for the particular offices and operations of those various  tribes, 'Plato, in _Critias_, and after him his followers,  gave out that they were men's governors and keepers, our  lords and masters, as we are of our cattle. They govern  provinces and kingdoms by oracles, auguries, dreams, rewards  and punishments, prophecies, inspirations, sacrifices and  religious _superstitions_, varied in as many forms as there be  diversity of spirits; they send wars, plagues, peace, sickness,  health, dearth, plenty, as appears by those histories of  Thucydides, Livius, Dionysius Halicarnassensis, with many others,  that are full of their wonderful stratagems.' They formerly devoted  themselves, each one, to the service of particular individuals as  familiar demons, 'private spirits.' Numa, Socrates, and many  others were indebted to their _Genius_. The power of the devil is  not limited to the body. 'Many think he can work upon the body,  but not upon the mind. But experience pronounceth otherwise, that  he can work both upon body and mind. Tertullian is of this  opinion.'    The causes and inducements of 'possession' are many. One writer  affirms that 'the devil being a slender, incomprehensible spirit  can easily insinuate and wind himself into human bodies, and  cunningly couched in our bowels, vitiate our healths, terrify our  souls with fearful dreams, and shake our minds with furies. They  go in and out of our bodies as bees do in a hive, and so provoke  and tempt us as they perceive our temperature inclined of itself  and most apt to be deluded.... Agrippa and Lavater are persuaded  that this humour [the melancholy] invites the devil into it,  wheresoever it is in extremity, and, of all other, melancholy  persons are most subject to diabolical temptations and illusions,  and most apt to entertain them, and the devil best able to work  upon them. 'But whether,' declares Burton, 'by obsession, or  possession, or otherwise, I will not determine; 'tis a difficult  question.'[79]      [79] _The Anatomy of Melancholy_, by Democritus junior;    edited by Democritus minor. Part i. sect. 2. An equally    copious and curious display of learning. Few authors,    probably, have been more plagiarised.    The mediaevalists believed themselves surrounded everywhere by  spiritual beings; but unlike the ancients, they were convinced  not so much that they were the peculiar care of heaven as that  they were the miserable victims of hellish malice, ever seeking  their temporal as well as eternal destruction; a fact apparent in  the whole mediaeval literature and art.[80]      [80] Sismondi (_Literature of the South of Europe_) has    observed of the greatest epic of the Middle Age, that    'Dante, in common with many fathers of the Church, under the    supposition that paganism, in the persons of the infernal    gods, represented the fallen angels, has made no scruple to    adopt its fables.' Tasso, at a later period, introduces the    deities of heathendom. In the _Gerusalemme Liberata_ they    sit in council to frustrate the plans and destroy the forces    of the Christian leaders before Jerusalem (iv). Ismeno, a    powerful magician in the ranks of the Turks, brings up a    host of diabolic allies to guard the wood which supplied the    infidels with materials for carrying on the siege of the    city (xiii.). And the masterpieces of art of Guido or    Raffaelle, which excite at once admiration and despair in    their modern disciples, consecrated and immortalised the    vulgar superstition.    Glanvil's conjectures on the cause of the _comparative_ rarity of  demoniac and other spiritual apparitions in general may interest  the credulous or curious reader. ''Tis very probable,' reasons  the Doctor, 'that the state wherein they are will not easily  permit palpable intercourses between the bad genii and mankind:  since 'tis like enough their own laws and government do not allow  their frequent excursions into the world. Or it may with great  probability be supposed that 'tis a very hard and painful thing  for them to force their thin and _tenuious_ bodies into a visible  consistence, and such shapes as are necessary for their designs  in their correspondence with witches. For in this action their  bodies must needs be exceedingly compressed, which cannot well be  without a painful sense. And this is, perhaps, a reason why there  are so few apparitions, and why appearing spirits are commonly in  such a hurry to be gone, viz. that they may be delivered of the  unnatural pressure of their tender vehicles,[81] which I confess  holds more in the apparition of good than evil spirits ... the  reason of which probably is the greater subtlety and tenuity of  the former, which will require far greater degrees of compression  and consequently of pain to make them visible; whereas the latter  are feculent and gross, and so nearer allied to palpable  existences, and more easily reducible to appearance and  visibility.'[82]      [81] So specious a theory must have occurred to, and its    propriety will easily be recognised by, the spirit and ghost    advocates of the present day.      [82] _Sadducismus Triumphatus._ Considerations about    Witchcraft. Sect. xi.    'Palpable intercourses between the bad genii and mankind' are  more frequent than Dr. Glanvil was disposed to believe; and he  must have been conversant with the acts of Incubus and Succubus.  In the first age (orbe novo c[oe]loque recenti) under the  Saturnian regime, 'while yet there was no fear of Jove,'[83]  innocence prevailed undisturbed; but soon as the silver age was  inaugurated by the usurpation of Jove, _liaisons_ between gods  and mortals became frequent. Love affairs between good or bad  'genii' and mankind are of common occurrence in the mythology of  most peoples. In the romance-tales of the middle age lovers find  themselves unexpectedly connected with some mysterious being of  inhuman kind. The writers in defence of witchcraft quote Genesis  vi. in proof of the reality of such intercourses; and Justin  Martyr and Tertullian, the great apologists of Christianity, and  others of the Fathers, interpret _Filios Dei_ to be angels or  evil spirits who, enamoured with the beauty of the women, begot  the primeval giants.[84]      [83] 'Jove nondum Barbato.'      [84] Milton indignantly exclaims, alluding to this common    fancy of the leaders of the Primitive Church, 'Who would    think him fit to write an apology for Christian faith to the    Roman Senate that could tell them \"how of the angels\"--of    which he must needs mean those in Genesis called the Sons of    God--\"mixing with women were begotten the devils,\" as good    Justin Martyr in his Apology told them.' (_Reformation in    England_, book i.). And 'Clemens Alexandrinus, Sulpicius    Severus, Eusebius, &c., make a twofold fall of angels--one    from the beginning of the world; another a little before the    deluge, as Moses teacheth us, openly professing that these    _genii_ can beget and have carnal copulation with woman'    (_Anatomy of Melancholy_, part i.). Robert Burton gives in    his adhesion to the sentiments of Lactantius (xiv. 15). It    seems that the later Jewish devils owe their origin    (according to the Talmudists, as represented by Pererius in    the _Anatomy_) to a former wife of Adam, called Lilis, the    predecessor of Eve.    Some tremendous results of diabolic connections appear in the  metrical romances of the twelfth or thirteenth century, as well  as in those early Anglo-Norman chroniclers or fabulists, who have  been at the pains to inform us of the pre-historic events of  their country.
