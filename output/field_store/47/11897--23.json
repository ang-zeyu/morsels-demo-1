Algeria's    primary political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), has    dominated politics ever since. Many Algerians in the subsequent    generation were not satisfied, however, and moved to counter the    FLN's centrality in Algerian politics. The surprising first round    success of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991    balloting spurred the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the    second round of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared    would be an extremist-led government from assuming power. The army    began a crack down on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin    attacking government targets. The government later allowed elections    featuring pro-government and moderate religious-based parties, but    did not appease the activists who progressively widened their    attacks. The fighting escalated into an insurgency, which saw    intense fighting between 1992-1998 and which resulted in over    100,000 deaths - many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of    villagers by extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the    late-1990s and FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army,    disbanded in January 2000. However, small numbers of armed militants    persist in confronting government forces and conducting ambushes and    occasional attacks on villages. The army placed Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA    in the presidency in 1999 in a fraudulent election but claimed    neutrality in his 2004 landslide reelection victory. A number of    longstanding problems continue to face BOUTEFLIKA in his second    term, including the ethnic minority Berbers' ongoing autonomy    campaign, large-scale unemployment, a shortage of housing,    unreliable electrical and water supplies, government inefficiencies    and corruption, and the continuing - although significantly degraded    - activities of extremist militants. Algeria must also diversify its    petroleum-based economy, which has yielded a large cash reserve but    which has not been used to redress Algeria's many social and    infrastructure problems. Algeria assumed a two-year seat on the UN    Security Council in January 2004.

The    government has taken measures to curb violent crime and to spur    economic activity and trade. The economy is bolstered by annual    remittances from abroad of $600-$800 million, mostly from Greece and    Italy; this helps offset the towering trade deficit. Agriculture,    which accounts for about one-half of GDP, is held back because of    frequent drought and the need to modernize equipment, to clarify    property rights, and to consolidate small plots of land. Energy    shortages and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure make it    difficult to attract and sustain foreign investment. The planned    construction of a new thermal power plant near Vlore and improved    transmission and distribution facilities will help relieve the    energy shortages. Also, the government is moving slowly to improve    the poor national road and rail network, a long-standing barrier to    sustained economic growth. On the positive side: growth was strong    in 2003 and 2004, the nation has important oil and gas reserves, and    inflation is not a problem.
