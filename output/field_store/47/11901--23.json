This method serves equally well for films and for sections.          VII. METHODS OF DEMONSTRATING BACTERIA IN TISSUES.      For bacteriological purposes, sections of tissue are most conveniently  prepared by either the ~freezing method~ or the ~paraffin method~.    The latter is decidedly preferable, but as it is of greater importance  to demonstrate the bacteria, if such are present, than to preserve the  tissue elements unaltered, the \"frozen\" sections are often of value.    Whichever method is selected, it is necessary to take small pieces of  the tissue for sectioning,--2 to 5 mm. cubes when possible, but in any  case not exceeding half a centimetre in thickness. Post-mortem material  should be secured as soon after the death of the animal as possible.    The tissue is prepared for cutting by--    (a) Fixation; that is, by causing the death of the cellular elements  in such a manner that they retain their characteristic shape and form.    The fixing fluids in general use are: Absolute alcohol; corrosive  sublimate, saturated aqueous solution; corrosive sublimate, Lang's  solution (_vide_ page 82); formaldehyde, 4 per cent. aqueous solution.  (Of these, Lang's corrosive sublimate solution is decidedly the best  all-round \"fixative.\")    (b) Hardening; that is, by rendering the tissue of sufficient  consistency to admit of thin slices or \"sections\" being cut from it.  This is effected by passing the tissue successively through alcohols of  gradually increasing strength: 30 per cent. alcohol, 50 per cent.  alcohol, 75 per cent. alcohol, 90 per cent. alcohol, absolute alcohol.    In both these processes a large excess of fluid should always be used.      FREEZING METHOD.    1. ~Fixation.~ Place the pieces of tissue in a wide-mouthed glass bottle  and fill with absolute alcohol. Allow the tissues to remain therein for  twenty-four hours.    2. ~Hardening.~ Remove the alcohol (no longer absolute, as it has taken up  water from the tissues) from the bottle and replace it with fresh  absolute alcohol. Allow the tissues to remain therein for twenty-four  hours.    [Illustration: FIG. 71.--Washing tissues.]         NOTE.--If not needed for cutting immediately, the hardened       tissues can be stored in 75 per cent. alcohol.    3. Remove the alcohol from the tissues by soaking in water from one to  two hours. Remove the stopper from the bottle; rest a glass funnel in  the open mouth and place under a tap of running water. The water of  course, overflows, but the tissues remain in the bottle (Fig. 71).    4. Impregnate the tissues with mucilage for twelve to twenty-four hours,  according to size. Transfer the pieces of tissue to a bottle containing  sterilised gum mixture.    ~Formula.~--        Gum arabic      5 grammes      Saccharose      1 gramme      Boric acid      1 gramme      Water         100 c.c.    5. Place the tissue on the plate of a freezing microtome (Cathcart's is  perhaps the best form), cover and surround with fresh gum mixture;  freeze with ether, or for preference, carbon dioxide, and cut sections.    6. Float the sections off the knife into a glass dish containing tepid  water and allow them to remain therein for about an hour to dissolve out  the gum.    (If not required at once, store in 90 per cent. alcohol.)    7. Transfer to a glass capsule containing the selected staining fluid,  by means of a section lifter.    8. Transfer the sections in turn to a capsule containing absolute  alcohol (to dehydrate) and to one containing xylol or oil of cloves (to  clear).    9. Mount in xylol balsam.    _Alternative Rapid Method._--         1. Cut very small blocks of the tissue.         2. Fix in formalin 10 per cent. aqueous solution (fixation       fluid No. 7, page 82) for 24 hours.         3. Transfer block to plate of freezing microtome and freeze       with carbon dioxide vapour.         4. Float the sections off the knife into a glass dish of       tepid water.         5. Stain the sections in glass capsules containing selected       stains.         6. Place the stained section in a dish of clean water and       introduce a glass slide obliquely beneath the section; with       a mounted needle draw the section on to the slide and hold       it there; gently remove the slide from the water, taking       care that any folds in the section are floated out before       the slide is finally removed from the water.         7. Drain away as much water as possible from the section.       Drop absolute alcohol on to the section from a drop bottle,       to dehydrate it.         8. Double a piece of blotting paper and gently press it on       the section to dry it.         9. Drop on xylol to clear the section.         10. Place a large drop of xylol balsam on the section and       carefully lower a cover-glass on to the balsam.      PARAFFIN METHOD.    1. ~Fixation.~ Place the pieces of tissue, resting on cotton-wool, in a  wide-mouthed glass bottle. Pour on a sufficient quantity of the  corrosive sublimate fixing fluid; allow the tissue to remain therein for  twelve to twenty-four hours according to size.    2. Pour off the fixing fluid and wash thoroughly in running water for  twenty minutes to half an hour to remove the excess of corrosive  sublimate.    [Illustration: FIG. 72.--~L~-shaped brass moulds.]    [Illustration: FIG. 73.--Paraffin kettle.]    3. ~Hardening.~ Place the tissues in each of the following strengths of  alcohol in turn for from twelve to twenty-four hours: 50 per cent., 75  per cent., 90 per cent., absolute.    4. ~Dehydration~ is effected by transferring the tissues to fresh absolute  alcohol.    5. ~Clearing.~ Half fill a wide-mouthed bottle with chloroform. On the  surface of the chloroform float a layer of absolute alcohol about five  to ten millimetres in depth. Place the pieces of tissue in the layer of  alcohol and when they have sunk through this layer, transfer them to  pure chloroform for from six to twenty-four hours according to the size  of the pieces. When \"cleared,\" the tissue becomes more or less  transparent.    6. ~Infiltration.~ Place the cleared tissues in fresh chloroform with  several pieces of paraffin wax and stand in a warm place, such as on the  top of the warm incubator. The warmth gradually melts the paraffin and  the tissues should remain in the mixture about twenty-four hours.    7. Transfer the tissues to a vessel containing pure melted paraffin.  Place this vessel in a paraffin water-bath regulated for 2 deg. C. above  the melting-point of the paraffin used, and allow the tissues to soak for  some four to six hours to ensure complete impregnation. The paraffin  used should have a melting-point of not more than 58 deg. C. For all  ordinary purposes 54 deg. C. will be found quite high enough.    8. Imbed in fresh paraffin in a metal (or paper) mould.    (a) Arrange a pair of ~L~-shaped pieces of metal on a plate of glass to  form a rectangular trough (Fig. 72).    (b) Pour fresh melted paraffin into the mould from a special vessel  (Fig. 73).    (c) Lift the piece of tissue from the paraffin bath and arrange it in  the mould.    (d) Blow gently on the surface of the paraffin in the mould, and as  soon as a film of solid paraffin has formed, carefully lift the glass  plate on which the mould is set and lower plate and mould together into  a basin of cold water.    (e) When the block is cold, break off the metal ~L~'s; trim off the  excess of paraffin from around the tissue with a knife, taking care to  retain the rectangular shape, and store the block in a pill-box.    When several pieces of tissue have to be imbedded at one time, shapes of  stout copper, 10 cm., 5 cm., and 2.5 cm. square respectively, and 0.75  cm. deep (Fig. 74) will be found extremely useful. These placed upon  plates of glass replace the pair of L's in the above process. When the  paraffin has set firmly the screw a should be loosened to allow the  two halves of the flange b to separate slightly--this facilitates  removal of the paraffin block.    [Illustration: FIG. 74.--Paraffin mould.]    8. Cement the block on the carrier of a \"paraffin\" microtome (the Minot,  the Jung, or the Cambridge Rocker) with a little melted paraffin.  Greater security is obtained if the paraffin around the base of the  block is melted by means of a hot metal or glass rod.    9. Cut sections--thin, and if possible in ribbands.      ~Mounting Paraffin Sections.~--    1. Place a large drop of 30 per cent. alcohol on the centre of a slide  (or cover-slip) and float the section on to the surface of the drop,  from a section lifter.    2. Hold the slide in the fingers of one hand and warm cautiously over  the flame of a Bunsen burner, touching the under surface of the glass  from time to time on the back of the other hand. As soon as the slide  feels distinctly warm to the skin, the paraffin section will flatten out  and all wrinkles disappear.    (The slide with the section floating on it may be rested on the top of  the paraffin bath for two or three minutes, instead of warming over the  flame as here described.)    3. Cautiously tilt up the slide and blot off the excess of spirit with  blotting paper, leaving the section attached to the centre of the  slide.    4. Place the slide in a wire rack (Fig. 75), section downward, in the  \"hot\" incubator for twelve to twenty-four hours. At the end of this time  the section is firmly adherent to the glass, and is treated during the  subsequent steps as a \"fixed\" cover-glass film preparation.         NOTE.--If large, thick sections have to be manipulated, or       if time is of importance or acids are used during the       staining process, it is often advisable to add a trace of  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27748"],[0,"Popular Lectures on Zoonomia (#18)"],[1,"proper sensation denoting  the presence or properties of external objects. Thus too small a  degree of light makes no impression on the optic nerve; and if the  object be too strongly illuminated, the eye is pained, but has no  proper idea of the figure or colour of the object. In the same way,  if the vibrations which give us an idea of sound, be either too quick  or too slow, we shall not obtain this idea. When the vibration is too  quick, a very disagreeable and irritating sensation is perceived, as  for instance, in the whetting of a saw: and on the other hand, when  the vibrations are too slow, they will not produce a tone or sound.  This might be proved of all the senses, and shows, that a certain  degree of impression is necessary to produce perfect sensation.    There is another circumstance likewise requisite to produce  sensation: it is not enough, that the impression should be of the  proper strength; it is necessary likewise, that it should remain for  some time, otherwise no sensation will be produced. There are many  bodies whose magnitude is amply sufficient to be perceived by the  eye; yet, by reason of their great velocity, the impulse they make on  any part of the retina is so short, that they are not visible. This  is proved by our not perceiving the motions of cannon and musket  balls, and many other kinds of motion. On this principle depends the  art of conjuration, or legerdemain; the fundamental maxim of those  who practise them, is, that the motion is too quick for sight.    If the impulse be of a proper degree, and be continued for a  sufficient length of time, the impression made by it will not  immediately vanish with the impulse which caused it, but will remain  for a time proportioned to the strength of the impulse. This, with  respect to sight, is proved by whirling a firebrand in a circular  manner, by which the impression of a circle is caused, instead of a  moving point: and, with respect to hearing, it may be observed, that  when children run with a stick quickly along railing, or when a drum  is beaten quickly, the idea of a continued sound is produced, because  the impression remains some time: for it is evident, that the sounds  produced in succession are perfectly distinct and insulated.    Sensation likewise depends, in a great measure, on the state of the  mind, and on the degree of attention which it gives. For if we are  engaged in attention to any object, we are insensible of the  impressions made upon us by others, though they are sufficiently  strong to affect us at other times. Thus, when our attention is fixed  strongly upon any particular object, we become insensible of the  various noises that surround us, though these may be sometimes very  loud. On the contrary, if our attention be upon the watch, we can  perceive slight, and almost neglected impressions, while those of  greater magnitude become insensible. The ticking of a clock becomes  insensible to us from repetition, but if we attend to it, we become  easily sensible of it, though at the same time we become insensible  of much stronger impressions, such as the rattling of coaches in the  streets.    The attention depends in some degree on the will, but is generally  given to those impressions which are particularly strong, new,  pleasant, or disagreeable; in short, to those which particularly  affect the mind. Hence it is, that things which are new, produce the  most vivid impressions, which gradually grow fainter, and at last  become imperceptible.    There is one circumstance respecting sensation, which will probably  account for our only perceiving those impressions to which the mind  attends: and this is, that the mind is incapable of perceiving more  than one impression at a time: the more accurately we examine this,  the greater reason we shall have to think it true; but the mind can  turn its attention so quickly, from one object to another, that at  first sight, we are led to believe, that we are able to attend to  several at the same time.    But though the mind cannot perceive or attend to various sensations  at the same time, yet if two or more of these are capable of uniting  in such a manner as to produce a compound sensation, this may be  perceived by the mind.    This compound sensation may be produced either by impressions made at  the same instant, or succeeding each other so quickly, that the  second takes place before the first has vanished.    As an instance of the first, we may mention musical chords, or the  sounds produced by the union of two or more tones at the same time.  We have another instance likewise in odours or smells; if two or more  perfumes be mixed together, a compound odour will be perceived,  different from any of them.    As an instance of the latter, if a paper painted of various colours  be made to revolve rapidly in a circle, a compound colour, different  from any of them, will be perceived. These observations apply  particularly to the senses we have mentioned, and likewise to taste:  but the sensations afforded us by touch do not seem capable of being  compounded in this manner.    There are many things necessary to perfect sensation, besides those  that have been mentioned. The degree and perfection of sensation will  depend much on the mind, and will be continually altered by delirium,  torpor, sleep, and other circumstances; much likewise depends on the  state of the organs with respect to preceding impressions; for if any  organ of sense have been subjected to a strong impression, it will  become nearly insensible of those which are weaker.    Of this innumerable instances may be given: an eye which has been  subjected to a strong light, becomes insensible of a weaker: and on  the contrary, if the organs of sense have been deprived of their  accustomed impressions for some time, they are affected by very  slight ones. Hence it is, that when a person goes from daylight into  a darkened room, he can at first see nothing; by degrees however he  begins to have an imperfect perception of the different objects, and  if he remain long enough, he will see them with tolerable  distinctness, though the quantity of light be the same as when he  entered the room, when they were invisible to him.    Sensation often arises from internal causes, without any external  impulse. To this source may be referred consciousness, memory,  imagination, volition, and other affections of the mind. These are  called the internal senses. The senses, whether internal or external,  have never been accurately reduced to classes, orders, or genera; the  external indeed are generally referred to five orders; namely,  seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling, or touch. With  respect to the four first, the few qualities of external bodies which  each perceives may be easily reduced to classes, each of which may be  referred to its peculiar organ of sensation, because each organ is so  constituted, that it can only be affected by one class of properties;  thus the eye can only be affected by light; the ear by the vibrations  of the air, and so of the rest.    The same organ, whatever be its state, or whatever be the degree of  impulse, always gives to the mind a similar sensation; nor is it  possible, by any means we are acquainted with, to communicate the  sensation peculiar to one organ by means of another. Thus we are  incapable, for instance, of hearing with our eyes, and seeing with  our ears: nor have we any reason to believe that similar impressions  produce dissimilar sensations in different people. The pleasure,  however, as well as the pain and disgust, accompanying different  sensations, differ very greatly in different persons, and even in the  same person at different times; for the sensations which sometimes  afford us pleasure, at other times produce disgust.    Habit has a powerful influence in modifying the pleasures of  sensation, without producing any change in the sensation itself, or  in the external qualities suggested by it. Habit, for instance, will  never cause a person to mistake gentian or quassia for sugar, but it  may induce an appetite or liking for what is bitter, and a disgust  for what is sweet. No person perhaps was originally delighted with  the taste of opium or tobacco, they must at first be highly  disgusting to most people; but custom not only reconciles the taste  to them, but they become grateful, and even necessary.    Almost every species of sensation becomes grateful or otherwise,  according to the force of the impression; for there is no sensation  so pleasant, but, that, by increasing its intensity, it will become  ungrateful, and at length intolerable. And, on the contrary, there  are many which on account of their force are naturally unpleasant,  but become, when diminished, highly pleasant. The softest and  sweetest sounds may be increased to such a degree as to be extremely  unpleasant: and when we are in the steeple of a church, the noise of  a peal of bells stuns and confounds our senses, while at a distance  their effect is very pleasant. The smell of musk likewise at a  distance, and in small quantity, is pleasant; but when brought near,  or in large quantity, it becomes highly disagreable. The same may be  observed with respect to the objects of the other senses.    For a similar reason, many sensations which are at first pleasing,  cease to delight by frequent repetition; though the impression  remains the same. This is so well known that illustrations are  unnecessary. Those who are economical of their pleasures, or who wish  them to be permanent, must not repeat them too frequently. In music,  a constant repetition of the sweetest and fullest chords, cloys the  ear; while a judicious mixture of them with tones less harmonious  will be long relished. Those who are best acquainted with the human  heart need not be told, that this observation is not confined to  music.    On the same principle likewise we can account for the"]]]
