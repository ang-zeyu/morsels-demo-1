And I  remember I have observ'd, not farr from the _Alps_, that at a certain  time of the Year the Butter of that Country was very Offensive to  strangers, by reason of the rank tast of a certain Herb, whereon the  Cows were then wont plentifully to feed. But (proceeds _Carneades_) to  give you Instances of another kind, to shew that things may be  obtain'd by the Fire from a Mixt Body that were not Pre-existent in  it, let Me Remind You, that from many Vegetables there may without any  Addition be Obtain'd Glass, a Body, which I presume You will not say  was Pre-existent in it, but produc'd by the Fire. To which I shall  add but this one Example more, namely that by a certain Artificial way  of handling Quicksilver, You may without Addition separate from it at  least a 5th. or 4th. part of a clear Liquor, which with an Ordinary  Peripatetick would pass for Water, and which a Vulgar Chymist would  not scruple to call Phlegme, and which, for ought I have yet seen or  heard, is not reducible into Mercury again, and Consequently is more  then a Disguise of it. Now besides that divers Chymists will not allow  Mercury to have any or at least any Considerable Quantity of either of  the Ignoble Ingredients, Earth and Water; Besides this, I say, the  great Ponderousness of Quicksilver makes it very unlikely that it can  have so much Water in it as may be thus obtain'd from it, since  Mercury weighs 12 or 14 times as much as water of the same Bulk. Nay  for a further Confirmation of this Argument, I will add this Strange  Relation, that two Friends of mine, the one a Physitian, and the other  a Mathematician, and both of them Persons of unsuspected Credit, have  Solemnly assured me, that after many Tryals they made, to reduce  Mercury into Water, in Order to a Philosophicall Work, upon Gold  (which yet, by the way, I know prov'd Unsuccesfull) they did once by  divers Cohobations reduce a pound of Quicksilver into almost a pound  of Water, and this without the Addition of any other Substance, but  only by pressing the Mercury by a Skillfully Manag'd Fire in purposely  contriv'd Vessels. But of these Experiments our Friend (sayes  _Carneades_, pointing at the Register of this Dialogue) will perhaps  give You a more Particular Account then it is necessary for me to do:  Since what I have now said may sufficiently evince, that the Fire may  sometimes as well alter Bodies as divide them, and by it we may obtain  from a Mixt Body what was not Pre-existent in it. And how are we sure  that in no other Body what we call Phlegme is barely separated, not  Produc'd by the Action of the Fire: Since so many other Mixt Bodies  are of a much less Constant, and more alterable Nature, then Mercury,  by many Tricks it is wont to put upon Chymists, and by the Experiments  I told You of, about an hour since, Appears to be. But because I  shall ere long have Occasion to resume into Consideration the Power of  the Fire to produce new Concretes, I shall no longer insist on this  Argument at present; only I must mind You, that if You will not  dis-believe _Helmonts_ Relations, You must confess that the _Tria  Prima_ are neither ingenerable nor incorruptible Substances; since by  his _Alkahest_ some of them may be produc'd of Bodies that were before  of another Denomination; and by the same powerfull _Menstruum_ all of  them may be reduc'd into insipid Water.    Here _Carneades_ was about to pass on to his Third Consideration, when  _Eleutherius_ being desirous to hear what he could say to clear his  second General Consideration from being repugnant to what he seem'd to  think the true Theory of Mistion, prevented him by telling him, I  somewhat wonder, _Carneades_, that You, who are in so many Points  unsatisfied with the Peripatetick Opinion touching the Elements and  Mixt Bodies, should also seem averse to that Notion touching the  manner of Mistion, wherein the Chymists (though perhaps without  knowing that they do so) agree with most of the Antient Philosophers  that preceded _Aristotle_, and that for Reasons so considerable, that  divers Modern Naturalists and Physitians, in other things unfavourable  enough to the Spagyrists, do in this case side with them against the  common Opinion of the Schools. If you should ask me (continues  _Eleutherius_) what Reasons I mean? I should partly by the Writings of  _Sennertus_ and other learned Men, and partly by my own Thoughts, be  supply'd with more, then 'twere at present proper for me to Insist  largely on. And therefore I shall mention only, and that briefly,  three or four. Of these, I shall take the First from the state of the  Controversie itself, and the genuine Notion of Mistion, which though  much intricated by the Schoolmen, I take in short to be this,  _Aristotle_, at least as many of his Interpreters expound him, and as  indeed he Teaches in some places, where he professedly Dissents from  the Antients, declares Mistion to be such a mutual Penetration, and  perfect Union of the mingl'd Elements, that there is no Portion of the  mixt Body, how Minute soever, which does not contain All, and Every  of the Four Elements, or in which, if you please, all the Elements are  not. And I remember, that he reprehends the Mistion taught by the  Ancients, as too sleight or gross, for this Reason, that Bodies mixt  according to their _Hypothesis_, though they appear so to humane Eyes,  would not appear such to the acute Eyes of a _Lynx_, whose perfecter  Sight would discerne the Elements, if they were no otherwise mingled,  than as his Predecessors would have it, to be but Blended, not United;  whereas the Antients, though they did not all Agree about what kind of  Bodies were Mixt, yet they did almost unanimously hold, that in a  compounded Bodie, though the _Miscibilia_, whether Elements,  Principles, or whatever they pleas'd to call them, were associated in  such small Parts, and with so much Exactness, that there was no  sensible Part of the Mass but seem'd to be of the same Nature with the  rest, and with the whole; Yet as to the Atomes, or other Insensible  Parcels of Matter, whereof each of the _Miscibilia_ consisted, they  retain'd each of them its own Nature, being but by Apposition or  _Juxta_-Position united with the rest into one Bodie. So that  although by virtue of this composition the mixt Body did perhaps  obtain Divers new Qualities, yet still the Ingredients that Compounded  it, retaining their own Nature, were by the Destruction of the  _Compositum_ separable from each other, the minute Parts disingag'd  from those of a differing Nature, and associated with those of their  own sort returning to be again, Fire, Earth, or Water, as they were  before they chanc'd to be Ingredients of that _Compositum_. This may  be explain'd (Continues _Eleutherius_,) by a piece of Cloath made of  white and black threds interwoven, wherein though the whole piece  appear neither white nor black, but of a resulting Colour, that is  gray, yet each of the white and black threds that compose it, remains  what it was before, as would appear if the threds were pull'd asunder,  and sorted each Colour by it self. This (pursues _Eleutherius_) being,  as I understand it, the State of the Controversie, and the  _Aristotelians_ after their Master Commonly Defining, that Mistion is  _Miscibilium alteratorum Unio_, that seems to comport much better  with the Opinion of the Chymists, then with that of their Adversaries,  since according to that as the newly mention'd Example declares, there  is but a _Juxta_-position of separable Corpuscles, retaining each its  own Nature, whereas according to the _Aristotelians_, when what they  are pleas'd to call a mixt Body results from the Concourse of the  Elements, the _Miscibilia_ cannot so properly be said to be Alter'd,  as Destroy'd, since there is no Part in the mixt Body, how small  soever, that can be call'd either Fir [Transcriber's Note: Fire], or  Air, or Water, or Earth.    Nor indeed can I well understand, how Bodies can be mingl'd other  wayes then as I have declar'd, or at least how they can be mingl'd, as  our Peripateticks would have it. For whereas _Aristotle_ tells us,  that if a Drop of Wine be put into ten thousand Measures of Water, the  Wine being Overpower'd by so Vast a Quantity of Water will be turn'd  into it, he speaks to my Apprehension, very improbably; For though One  should add to that Quantity of Water as many Drops of Wine as would a  Thousand times exceed it all, yet by his Rule the whole Liquor should  not be a _Crama_, a Mixture of Wine and Water, wherein the Wine would  be Predominant, but Water only; Since the Wine being added but by a  Drop at a time would still Fall into nothing but Water, and  Consequently would be turn'd into it. And if this would hold in Metals  too, 'twere a rare secret for Goldsmiths, and Refiners; For by melting  a Mass of Gold, or Silver, and by but casting into it Lead or  Antimony, Grain after Grain, they might at pleasure, within a  reasonable Compass of time, turn what Quantity they desire, of the  Ignoble into the Noble Metalls. And indeed since a Pint of wine, and a  pint of water, amount to about a Quart of Liquor, it seems manifest to  sense, that these Bodies doe not Totally Penetrate one another, as one  would have it; but that each retains its own Dimensions; and  Consequently, that they are by being Mingl'd only divided into minute  Bodies, that do but touch one another with their Surfaces, as do the  Grains, of Wheat, Rye, Barley, &c. in a heap of severall sorts of  Corn: And unless we say, that as when one measure of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22925"],[0,"The Story of Young Abraham Lincoln (#18)"],[1,"Lincoln seems to have  thought little of that. The hatred of the people for any one who opposed  slavery was very bitter. Lincoln found one man, named Stone, who was  willing to sign a protest against the resolutions favoring slavery,  which read as follows:            \"Resolutions upon the subject of domestic          slavery having passed both branches of the          General Assembly at its present session, the          undersigned hereby protest against the passage          of the same.            \"They believe that the institution of slavery          is founded on both injustice and bad policy.          [After several statements of their belief          concerning the powers of Congress, the protest          closed as follows:]            \"The difference between their opinions and          those contained in the said resolution is their          reason for entering this protest.                                               \"DAN STONE,                                           \"A. LINCOLN.\"          CHAPTER XIV    MOVING TO SPRINGFIELD      New Salem could no longer give young Lincoln scope for his growing power  and influence. Within a few weeks after the Lincoln-Stone protest, late  in March, 1837, after living six years in the little village which held  so much of life and sorrow for him, Abe sold his surveying compass,  marking-pins, chain and pole, packed all his effects into his  saddle-bags, borrowed a horse of his good friend \"Squire\" Bowling Green,  and reluctantly said good-bye to his friends there. It is a strange fact  that New Salem ceased to exist within a year from the day \"Honest Abe\"  left it. Even its little post office was discontinued by the Government.    Henry C. Whitney, who was associated with Lincoln in those early days,  describes Abe's modest entry into the future State capital, with all his  possessions in a pair of saddle-bags, and calling at the store of Joshua  F. Speed, overlooking \"the square,\" in the following dialogue:    Speed--\"Hello, Abe, just from Salem?\"    Lincoln--\"Howdy, Speed! Yes, this is my first show-up.\"    Speed--\"So you are to be one of us?\"    Lincoln--\"I reckon so, if you will let me take pot luck with you.\"    Speed--\"All right, Abe; it's better than Salem.\"    Lincoln--\"I've been to Gorman's and got a single bedstead; now you  figure out what it will cost for a tick, blankets and so forth.\"    Speed (after figuring)--\"Say, seventeen dollars or so.\"    Lincoln (countenance paling)--\"I had no _idea_ it would cost half that,  and I--I can't pay it; but if you can wait on me till Christmas, and I  make anything, I'll pay; if I don't, I can't.\"    Speed--\"I can do better than that; upstairs I sleep in a bed big enough  for two, and you just come and sleep with me till you can do better.\"    Lincoln (brightening)--\"Good, where is it?\"    Speed--\"Upstairs behind that pile of barrels--turn to the right when you  go up.\"    Lincoln (returning joyously)--\"Well, Speed, I've moved!\"      STUART & LINCOLN    Major Stuart had grown so thoroughly interested in Lincoln, approving  the diligence with which the young law student applied himself to the  books which he had lent him, that, after his signal success in bringing  about the removal of the State capital to Springfield, the older man  invited the younger to go into partnership with him.    Abe had been admitted to the bar the year before, and had practiced law  in a small way before Squire Bowling Green in New Salem. Greatly  flattered by the offer of such a man, Abe gladly accepted, and soon  after his arrival in Springfield this sign, which thrilled the junior  partner's whole being, appeared in front of an office near the square:             ------------------------------          |    STUART & LINCOLN          |          | ATTORNEYS-AT-LAW             |           ------------------------------      \"I NEVER USE ANYONE'S MONEY BUT MY OWN\"    After a while Lincoln left Speed's friendly loft and slept on a lounge  in the law office, keeping his few effects in the little old-fashioned  trunk pushed out of sight under his couch.    One day an agent of the Post Office Department came in and asked if  Abraham Lincoln could be found there. Abe arose and, reaching out his  hand, said that was his name. The agent then stated his business; he had  come to collect a balance due the Post Office Department since the  closing of the post office at New Salem.    The young ex-postmaster looked puzzled for a moment, and a friend, who  happened to be present, hastened to his rescue with, \"Lincoln, if you  are in need of money, let us help you.\"    Abe made no reply, but, pulling out his little old trunk, he asked the  agent how much he owed. The man stated the amount, and he, opening the  trunk, took out an old cotton cloth containing coins, which he handed to  the official without counting, and it proved to be the exact sum  required, over seventeen dollars, evidently the very pieces of money Abe  had received while acting as postmaster years before!    After the department agent had receipted for the money and had gone out,  Mr. Lincoln quietly remarked:    \"I never use anyone's money but my own.\"      DROPS THROUGH THE CEILING TO DEMAND FREE SPEECH    Stuart & Lincoln's office was, for a time, over a court room, which was  used evenings as a hall. There was a square opening in the ceiling of  the court room, covered by a trap door in the room overhead where  Lincoln slept. One night there was a promiscuous crowd in the hall, and  Lincoln's friend, E. D. Baker, was delivering a political harangue.  Becoming somewhat excited Baker made an accusation against a well-known  newspaper in Springfield, and the remark was resented by several in the  audience.    \"Pull him down!\" yelled one of them as they came up to the platform  threatening Baker with personal violence. There was considerable  confusion which might become a riot.    Just at this juncture the spectators were astonished to see a pair of  long legs dangling from the ceiling and Abraham Lincoln dropped upon the  platform. Seizing the water pitcher he took his stand beside the  speaker, and brandished it, his face ablaze with indignation.    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, when the confusion had subsided, \"let us not  disgrace the age and the country in which we live. This is a land where  freedom of speech is guaranteed. Mr. Baker has a right to speak, and  ought to be permitted to do so. I am here to protect him and no man  shall take him from this stand if I can prevent it.\" Lincoln had opened  the trap door in his room and silently watched the proceedings until he  saw that his presence was needed below. Then he dropped right into the  midst of the fray, and defended his friend and the right of free speech  at the same time.      DEFENDING THE DEFENSELESS    A widow came to Mr. Lincoln and told him how an attorney had charged her  an exorbitant fee for collecting her pension. Such cases filled him with  righteous wrath. He cared nothing for \"professional etiquette,\" if it  permitted the swindling of a poor woman. Going directly to the greedy  lawyer, he forced him to refund to the widow all that he had charged in  excess of a fair fee for his services, or he would start proceedings at  once to prevent the extortionate attorney from practicing law any longer  at the Springfield bar.    If a negro had been wronged in any way, Lawyer Lincoln was the only  attorney in Springfield who dared to appear in his behalf, for he always  did so at great risk to his political standing. Sometimes he appeared in  defense of fugitive slaves, or negroes who had been freed or had run  away from southern or \"slave\" States where slavery prevailed to gain  liberty in \"free\" States in which slavery was not allowed. Lawyer  Lincoln did all this at the risk of making himself very unpopular with  his fellow-attorneys and among the people at large, the greater part of  whom were then in favor of permitting those who wished to own, buy and  sell negroes as slaves.    Lincoln always sympathized with the poor and down-trodden. He could not  bear to charge what his fellow-lawyers considered a fair price for the  amount of work and time spent on a case. He often advised those who came  to him to settle their disputes without going to law. Once he told a man  he would charge him a large fee if he had to try the case, but if the  parties in the dispute settled their difficulty without going into court  he would furnish them all the legal advice they needed free of charge.  Here is some excellent counsel Lawyer Lincoln gave, in later life, in  an address to a class of young attorneys:    \"Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever  you can. Point out to them how the nominal winner is often the real  loser--in fees, expenses and waste of time. As a peacemaker a lawyer has  a superior opportunity of becoming a good man. There will always be  enough business. Never stir up litigation. A worse man can scarcely be  found than one who does this. Who can be more nearly a fiend than he who  habitually overhauls the register of deeds in search of defects in  titles whereon to stir up strife and put money in his pocket. A moral  tone ought to be infused into the profession which should drive such men  out of it.\"      YOUNG LAWYER LINCOLN OFFERS TO PAY HALF THE DAMAGES    A wagonmaker in Mechanicsville, near Springfield, was sued on account of  a disputed bill. The other side had engaged the best lawyer in the  place. The cartwright saw that his own attorney would be unable to  defend the case well. So, when the day of the trial arrived he sent his  son-in-law to Springfield to bring Mr. Lincoln to save the day for him  if possible. He said to the messenger:    \"Son, you've just got time. Take this letter to my young friend, Abe  Lincoln, and bring him back in the buggy to appear in the case. Guess  he'll come if he can.\"    The young man from Mechanicsville found the lawyer in the"]]]
