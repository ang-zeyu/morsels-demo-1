He did not move an  inch, nor articulate a sound. Nothing could be heard in that large  chamber but the wing-whisper of a little moth, which was fluttering to  its death about the candles. Aramis, without even deigning to look at  the man whom he had reduced to so miserable a condition, drew from his  pocket a small case of black wax; he sealed the letter, and stamped it  with a seal suspended at his breast, beneath his doublet, and when the  operation was concluded, presented--still in silence--the missive to M.  de Baisemeaux. The latter, whose hands trembled in a manner to excite  pity, turned a dull and meaningless gaze upon the letter. A last gleam  of feeling played over his features, and he fell, as if thunder-struck,  on a chair.    \"Come, come,\" said Aramis, after a long silence, during which the  governor of the Bastile had slowly recovered his senses, \"do not lead  me to believe, dear Baisemeaux, that the presence of the general of the  order is as terrible as His, and that men die merely from having seen  Him. Take courage, rouse yourself; give me your hand--obey.\"    Baisemeaux, reassured, if not satisfied, obeyed, kissed Aramis's hand,  and rose. \"Immediately?\" he murmured.    \"Oh, there is no pressing haste, my host; take your place again, and do  the honors over this beautiful dessert.\"    \"Monseigneur, I shall never recover such a shock as this; I who have  laughed, who have jested with you! I who have dared to treat you on a  footing of equality!\"    \"Say nothing about it, old comrade,\" replied the bishop, who perceived  how strained the cord was and how dangerous it would have been to break  it; \"say nothing about it. Let us each live in our own way; to you,  my protection and my friendship; to me, your obedience. Having exactly  fulfilled these two requirements, let us live happily.\"    Baisemeaux reflected; he perceived, at a glance, the consequence of this  withdrawal of a prisoner by means of a forged order; and, putting in the  scale the guarantee offered him by the official order of the general,  did not consider it of any value.    Aramis divined this. \"My dear Baisemeaux,\" said he, \"you are a  simpleton. Lose this habit of reflection when I give myself the trouble  to think for you.\"    And at another gesture he made, Baisemeaux bowed again. \"How shall I set  about it?\" he said.    \"What is the process for releasing a prisoner?\"    \"I have the regulations.\"    \"Well, then, follow the regulations, my friend.\"    \"I go with my major to the prisoner's room, and conduct him, if he is a  personage of importance.\"    \"But this Marchiali is not an important personage,\" said Aramis  carelessly.    \"I don't know,\" answered the governor, as if he would have said, \"It is  for you to instruct me.\"    \"Then if you don't know it, I am right; so act towards Marchiali as you  act towards one of obscure station.\"    \"Good; the regulations so provide. They are to the effect that the  turnkey, or one of the lower officials, shall bring the prisoner before  the governor, in the office.\"    \"Well, 'tis very wise, that; and then?\"    \"Then we return to the prisoner the valuables he wore at the time of his  imprisonment, his clothes and papers, if the minister's orders have not  otherwise dictated.\"    \"What was the minister's order as to this Marchiali?\"    \"Nothing; for the unhappy man arrived here without jewels, without  papers, and almost without clothes.\"    \"See how simple, then, all is. Indeed, Baisemeaux, you make a mountain  of everything. Remain here, and make them bring the prisoner to the  governor's house.\"    Baisemeaux obeyed. He summoned his lieutenant, and gave him an order,  which the latter passed on, without disturbing himself about it, to the  next whom it concerned.    Half an hour afterwards they heard a gate shut in the court; it was the  door to the dungeon, which had just rendered up its prey to the free  air. Aramis blew out all the candles which lighted the room but one,  which he left burning behind the door. This flickering glare prevented  the sight from resting steadily on any object. It multiplied tenfold the  changing forms and shadows of the place, by its wavering uncertainty.  Steps drew near.    \"Go and meet your men,\" said Aramis to Baisemeaux.    The governor obeyed. The sergeant and turnkeys disappeared. Baisemeaux  re-entered, followed by a prisoner. Aramis had placed himself in the  shade; he saw without being seen. Baisemeaux, in an agitated tone of  voice, made the young man acquainted with the order which set him at  liberty. The prisoner listened, without making a single gesture or  saying a word.    \"You will swear ('tis the regulation that requires it),\" added the  governor, \"never to reveal anything that you have seen or heard in the  Bastile.\"    The prisoner perceived a crucifix; he stretched out his hands and swore  with his lips. \"And now, monsieur, you are free. Whither do you intend  going?\"    The prisoner turned his head, as if looking behind him for some  protection, on which he ought to rely. Then was it that Aramis came out  of the shade: \"I am here,\" he said, \"to render the gentleman whatever  service he may please to ask.\"    The prisoner slightly reddened, and, without hesitation, passed his arm  through that of Aramis. \"God have you in his holy keeping,\" he said, in  a voice the firmness of which made the governor tremble as much as the  form of the blessing astonished him.    Aramis, on shaking hands with Baisemeaux, said to him; \"Does my order  trouble you? Do you fear their finding it here, should they come to  search?\"    \"I desire to keep it, monseigneur,\" said Baisemeaux. \"If they found it  here, it would be a certain indication I should be lost, and in that  case you would be a powerful and a last auxiliary for me.\"    \"Being your accomplice, you mean?\" answered Aramis, shrugging his  shoulders. \"Adieu, Baisemeaux,\" said he.    The horses were in waiting, making each rusty spring reverberate the  carriage again with their impatience. Baisemeaux accompanied the bishop  to the bottom of the steps. Aramis caused his companion to mount before  him, then followed, and without giving the driver any further order, \"Go  on,\" said he. The carriage rattled over the pavement of the courtyard.  An officer with a torch went before the horses, and gave orders at  every post to let them pass. During the time taken in opening all the  barriers, Aramis barely breathed, and you might have heard his \"sealed  heart knock against his ribs.\" The prisoner, buried in a corner of the  carriage, made no more sign of life than his companion. At length, a  jolt more sever than the others announced to them that they had cleared  the last watercourse. Behind the carriage closed the last gate, that  in the Rue St. Antoine. No more walls either on the right or the left;  heaven everywhere, liberty everywhere, and life everywhere. The horses,  kept in check by a vigorous hand, went quietly as far as the middle of  the faubourg. There they began to trot. Little by little, whether they  were warming to their work, or whether they were urged, they gained in  swiftness, and once past Bercy, the carriage seemed to fly, so great was  the ardor of the coursers. The horses galloped thus as far as Villeneuve  St. George's, where relays were waiting. Then four instead of two  whirled the carriage away in the direction of Melun, and pulled up for  a moment in the middle of the forest of Senart. No doubt the order had  been given the postilion beforehand, for Aramis had no occasion even to  make a sign.    \"What is the matter?\" asked the prisoner, as if waking from a long  dream.    \"The matter is, monseigneur,\" said Aramis, \"that before going further,  it is necessary your royal highness and I should converse.\"    \"I will await an opportunity, monsieur,\" answered the young prince.    \"We could not have a better, monseigneur. We are in the middle of a  forest, and no one can hear us.\"    \"The postilion?\"    \"The postilion of this relay is deaf and dumb, monseigneur.\"    \"I am at your service, M. d'Herblay.\"    \"Is it your pleasure to remain in the carriage?\"    \"Yes; we are comfortably seated, and I like this carriage, for it has  restored me to liberty.\"    \"Wait, monseigneur; there is yet a precaution to be taken.\"    \"What?\"    \"We are here on the highway; cavaliers or carriages traveling  like ourselves might pass, and seeing us stopping, deem us in some  difficulty. Let us avoid offers of assistance, which would embarrass  us.\"    \"Give the postilion orders to conceal the carriage in one of the side  avenues.\"    \"'Tis exactly what I wished to do, monseigneur.\"    Aramis made a sign to the deaf and dumb driver of the carriage, whom  he touched on the arm. The latter dismounted, took the leaders by the  bridle, and led them over the velvet sward and the mossy grass of a  winding alley, at the bottom of which, on this moonless night, the deep  shades formed a curtain blacker than ink. This done, the man lay down  on a slope near his horses, who, on either side, kept nibbling the young  oak shoots.    \"I am listening,\" said the young prince to Aramis; \"but what are you  doing there?\"    \"I am disarming myself of my pistols, of which we have no further need,  monseigneur.\"        Chapter IX. The Tempter.    \"My prince,\" said Aramis, turning in the carriage towards his companion,  \"weak creature as I am, so unpretending in genius, so low in the scale  of intelligent beings, it has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27600"],[0,"Zoonomia; Or, the Laws of Organic Life, Vol. II (#18)"],[1,"to suspend the body occasionally, or in  part by the head, like the swing above mentioned. The use of this chair is  more efficacious in straightening the spine, than simply lying down  horizontally; as it not only takes off the pressure of the head and  shoulders from the spine, but at the same time the inferior parts of the  body contribute to draw the spine straight by their weight; or lastly,  recourse may be had to a spinal machine first described in the Memoires of  the academy of surgery in Paris, Vol. III. p. 600, by M. Le Vacher, and  since made by Mr. Jones, at N^o 6, North-street, Tottenham-court Road,  London, which suspends the head, and places the weight of it on the hips.  This machine is capable of improvement by joints in the bar at the back of  it, to permit the body to bend forwards without diminishing the extension  of the spine.    The objections of this machine of M. Vacher, which is made by Mr. Jones,  are first, that it is worn in the day-time, and has a very unsightly  appearance. Mr. Jones has endeavoured to remedy this, by taking away the  curved bar over the head, and substituting in its place a forked bar,  rising up behind each ear, with webs fastened to it, which pass under the  chin and occiput. But this is not an improvement, but a deterioration of M.  Vacher's machine, as it prevents the head from turning with facility to  either side. Another objection is, that its being worn, when the muscles of  the back are in action, it is rather calculated to prevent the curvature of  the spine from becoming greater, than to extend the spine, and diminish its  curvature.    [Illustration]    For this latter purpose I have made a steel bow, as described in the  annexed plate, which receives the head longitudinally from the forehead to  the occiput; having a fork furnished with a web to sustain the chin, and  another to sustain the occiput. The summit of the bow is fixed by a swivel  to the board going behind the head of the bed above the pillow. The bed is  to be inclined from the head to the feet about twelve or sixteen inches.  Hence the patient would be constantly sliding down during sleep, unless  supported by this bow, with webbed forks, covered also with fur, placed  beneath the chin, and beneath the occiput. There are also proper webs lined  with fur for the hands to take hold off occasionally, and also to go under  the arms. By these means I should hope great advantage from gradually  extending the spine during the inactivity of the muscles of the back; and  that it may be done without disturbing the sleep of the patient, and if  this should happen, the bow is made to open by a joint at the summit of it,  so as to be instantly disengaged from the neck by the hand of the wearer.  This bow I have not yet had opportunity to make use of, but it may be had  from Mr. Harrison, whitesmith, Bridge-gate, Derby.    It will be from hence easily perceived, that all other methods of confining  or directing the growth of young people should be used with great skill;  such as back-boards, or bandages, or stocks for the feet; and that their  application should not be continued too long at a time, lest worse  consequences should ensue, than the deformity they were designed to remove.  To this may be added, that the stiff erect attitude taught by some modern  dancing masters does not contribute to the grace of person, but rather  militates against it; as is well seen in one of the prints in Hogarth's  Analysis of Beauty; and is exemplifyed by the easy grace of some of the  ancient statues, as of the Venus de Medici, and the Antinous, and in the  works of some modern artists, as in a beautiful print of Hebe feeding an  Eagle, painted by Hamilton, and engraved by Eginton, and many of the  figures of Angelica Kauffman.    Where the bone of one of the vertebrae of the back has been swelled on both  sides of it, so as to become protuberant, issues near the swelled part have  been found of great service, as mentioned in Species 18 of this genus. This  has induced me to propose in curvatures of the spine, to put an issue on  the outside of the curve, where it could be certainly ascertained, as the  bones on the convex side of the curve must be enlarged; in one case I  thought this of service, and recommend the further trial of it.    In the tendency to curvature of the spine, whatever strengthens the general  constitution is of service; as the use of the cold bath in the summer  months. This however requires some restriction both in respect to the  degree of coldness of the bath, the time of continuing in it, and the  season of the year. Common springs, which are of forty-eight degrees of  heat, are too cold for tender constitutions, whether of children or adults,  and frequently do them great and irreparable injury. The coldness of river  water in the summer months, which is about sixty-eight degrees, or that of  Matlock, which is about sixty-eight, or of Buxton, which is eighty-two, are  much to be preferred. The time of continuing in the bath should be but a  minute or two, or not so long as to occasion a trembling of the limbs from  cold. In respect to the season of the year, delicate children should  certainly only bathe in the summer months; as the going frequently into the  cold air in winter will answer all the purposes of the cold bath.    17. _Claudicatio coxaria._ Lameness of the hip. A nodding of the thigh-bone  is said to be produced in feeble children by the softness of the neck or  upper part of that bone beneath the cartilage; which is naturally bent, and  in this disease bends more downwards, or nods, by the pressure of the body;  and thus renders one leg apparently shorter than the other. In other cases  the end of the bone is protruded out of its socket, by inflammation or  enlargement of the cartilages or ligaments of the joint, so that it rests  on some part of the edge of the acetabulum, which in time becomes filled  up. When the legs are straight, as in standing erect, there is no  verticillary motion in the knee-joint; all the motion then in turning out  the toes further than nature designed, must be obtained by straining in  some degree this head of the thigh-bone, or the acetabulum, or cavity, in  which it moves. This has induced me to believe, that this misfortune of the  nodding of the head by the bone, or partial dislocation of it, by which one  leg becomes shorter than the other, is sometimes occasioned by making very  young children stand in what are called stocks; that is with their heels  together, and their toes quite out. Whence the socket of the thigh-bone  becomes inflamed and painful, or the neck of the bone is bent downward and  outwards.    In this case there is no expectation of recovering the straightness of the  end of the bone; but these patients are liable to another misfortune, that  is, to acquire afterwards a distortion of the spine; for as one leg is  shorter than the other, they sink on that side, and in consequence bend the  upper part of their bodies, as their shoulders, the contrary way, to  balance themselves; and then again the neck is bent back again towards the  lame side, to preserve the head perpendicular; and thus the figure becomes  quite distorted like the letter S, owing originally to the deficiency of  the length of one limb. The only way to prevent this curvature of the spine  is for the child to wear a high-heeled shoe or patten on the lame foot, so  as to support that side on the same level with the other, and thus to  prevent a greater deformity.    I have this day seen a young lady about twelve, who does not limp or waddle  in walking; but nevertheless, when she stands or sits, she sinks down  towards her right side, and turns out that toe more than the other. Hence,  both as she sits and stands, she bends her body to the right; whence her  head would hang a little over her right shoulder; but to replace this  perpendicularly, she lifts up her left shoulder and contracts the muscles  on that side of the neck; which are therefore become thicker and stronger  by their continued action; but there is not yet any very perceptible  distortion of the spine.    As her right toe is turned outward rather more than natural, this shews the  disease to be in the hip-joint; because, when the limb is stretched out,  the toe cannot turn horizontally in the least without moving the end of the  thigh-bone; although when the knee is bent, the toe can be turned through  one third or half of a circle by the rotation of the tibia and fibula of  the leg round each other. Hence if children are set in stocks with their  heels touching each other as they sit, and are then made to rise up, till  they stand erect, the socket or head of the thigh-bone becomes injured,  especially in those children, whose bones are soft; and a shortness of that  limb succeeds either by the bending of the neck of the thigh-bone, or by  its getting out of the acetabulum; and a consequent rising of one shoulder,  and a curvature of the spine is produced from so distant a cause.    M. M. An elastic cushion made of curled hair should be placed under the  affected hip, whenever she sits; or should be fitted to the part by means  of drawers, so that she cannot avoid sitting on it. A neck-swing, and lying  down in the day, should be occasionally used to prevent or remove any  curvature of the spine. The rest as in Species 13 and 15 of this genus.    18. _Spina protuberans._ Protuberant spine. One of the bones of the spine  swells, and rises above the rest. This is not an uncommon disease, and  belongs to the innutrition of the bones, as the bone must become soft  before it swells; which softness is owing to defect of the secretion of  phosphorated calcareous earth. The swelling of the bone compresses a part  of the brain, called the spinal marrow, within the cavity of the  back-bones; and in consequence the lower limbs become paralytic, attended  sometimes with difficulty of"]]]
