There he was tried, and cast into the dungeons  for six years, and because he entirely refused to recant, was at length  delivered over to the secular arm and burned at the stake on 16th  February, Anno Domini 1600.    This event could not but have cast a gloom over the mind of lovers and  expounders of truth, and the lesson probably sank deep into Galileo's  soul.    In dealing with these historic events will you allow me to repudiate  once for all the slightest sectarian bias or meaning. I have nothing to  do with Catholic or Protestant as such. I have nothing to do with the  Church of Rome as such. I am dealing with the history of science. But  historically at one period science and the Church came into conflict. It  was not specially one Church rather than another--it was the Church in  general, the only one that then existed in those countries.  Historically, I say, they came into conflict, and historically the  Church was the conqueror. It got its way; and science, in the persons of  Bruno, Galileo, and several others, was vanquished.    Such being the facts, there is no help but to mention them in dealing  with the history of science.    Doubtless _now_ the Church regards it as an unhappy victory, and gladly  would ignore this painful struggle. This, however, is impossible. With  their creed the Churchmen of that day could act in no other way. They  were bound to prosecute heresy, and they were bound to conquer in the  struggle or be themselves shattered.    But let me insist on the fact that no one accuses the ecclesiastical  courts of crime or evil motives. They attacked heresy after their  manner, as the civil courts attacked witchcraft after _their_ manner.  Both erred grievously, but both acted with the best intentions.    We must remember, moreover, that his doctrines were scientifically  heterodox, and the University Professors of that day were probably quite  as ready to condemn them as the Church was. To realise the position we  must think of some subjects which _to-day_ are scientifically  heterodox, and of the customary attitude adopted towards them by  persons of widely differing creeds.    If it be contended now, as it is, that the ecclesiastics treated Galileo  well, I admit it freely: they treated him as well as they possibly  could. They overcame him, and he recanted; but if he had not recanted,  if he had persisted in his heresy, they would--well, they would still  have treated his soul well, but they would have set fire to his body.  Their mistake consisted not in cruelty, but in supposing themselves the  arbiters of eternal truth; and by no amount of slurring and glossing  over facts can they evade the responsibility assumed by them on account  of this mistaken attitude.    I am not here attacking the dogma of Papal Infallibility: it is  historically, I believe, quite unaffected by the controversy respecting  the motion of the earth, no Papal edict _ex cathedra_ having been  promulgated on the subject.    We left Galileo standing at his telescope and beginning his survey of  the heavens. We followed him indeed through a few of his first great  discoveries--the discovery of the mountains and other variety of surface  in the moon, of the nebulae and a multitude of faint stars, and lastly of  the four satellites of Jupiter.    This latter discovery made an immense sensation, and contributed its  share to his removal from Padua, which quickly followed it, as I shall  shortly narrate; but first I think it will be best to continue our  survey of his astronomical discoveries without regard to the place  whence they were made.    Before the end of the year Galileo had made another discovery--this time  on Saturn. But to guard against the host of plagiarists and impostors,  he published it in the form of an anagram, which, at the request of the  Emperor Rudolph (a request probably inspired by Kepler), he interpreted;  it ran thus: The furthest planet is triple.    Very soon after he found that Venus was changing from a full moon to a  half moon appearance. He announced this also by an anagram, and waited  till it should become a crescent, which it did.    This was a dreadful blow to the anti-Copernicans, for it removed the  last lingering difficulty to the reception of the Copernican doctrine.    [Illustration: FIG. 46.--Old drawings of Saturn by different observers,  with the imperfect instruments of that day. The first is Galileo's idea  of what he saw.]    Copernicus had predicted, indeed, a hundred years before, that, if ever  our powers of sight were sufficiently enhanced, Venus and Mercury would  be seen to have phases like the moon. And now Galileo with his  telescope verifies the prediction to the letter.    Here was a triumph for the grand old monk, and a bitter morsel for his  opponents.         Castelli writes: \"This must now convince the most obstinate.\" But       Galileo, with more experience, replies:--\"You almost make me laugh       by saying that these clear observations are sufficient to convince       the most obstinate; it seems you have yet to learn that long ago       the observations were enough to convince those who are capable of       reasoning, and those who wish to learn the truth; but that to       convince the obstinate, and those who care for nothing beyond the       vain applause of the senseless vulgar, not even the testimony of       the stars would suffice, were they to descend on earth to speak for       themselves. Let us, then, endeavour to procure some knowledge for       ourselves, and rest contented with this sole satisfaction; but of       advancing in popular opinion, or of gaining the assent of the       book-philosophers, let us abandon both the hope and the desire.\"    [Illustration: FIG. 47.--Phases of Venus. Showing also its apparent  variations in size by reason of its varying distance from the earth.  When fully illuminated it is necessarily most distant. It looks  brightest to us when a broad crescent.]    What a year's work it had been!    In twelve months observational astronomy had made such a bound as it has  never made before or since.    Why did not others make any of these observations? Because no one could  make telescopes like Galileo.    He gathered pupils round him however, and taught them how to work the  lenses, so that gradually these instruments penetrated Europe, and  astronomers everywhere verified his splendid discoveries.    But still he worked on, and by March in the very next year, he saw  something still more hateful to the Aristotelian philosophers, viz.  spots on the sun.    [Illustration: FIG. 48.]    If anything was pure and perfect it was the sun, they said. Was this  impostor going to blacken its face too?    Well, there they were. They slowly formed and changed, and by moving all  together showed him that the sun rotated about once a month.    Before taking leave of Galileo's astronomical researches, I must  mention an observation made at the end of 1612, that the apparent  triplicity of Saturn (Fig. 46) had vanished.    [Illustration: FIG. 49.--A portion of the sun's disk as seen in a  powerful modern telescope.]         \"Looking on Saturn within these few days, I found it solitary,       without the assistance of its accustomed stars, and in short       perfectly round and defined, like Jupiter, and such it still       remains. Now what can be said of so strange a metamorphosis? Are       perhaps the two smaller stars consumed like spots on the sun? Have       they suddenly vanished and fled? Or has Saturn devoured his own       children? Or was the appearance indeed fraud and illusion, with       which the glasses have so long time mocked me and so many others       who have so often observed with me? Now perhaps the time is come to       revive the withering hopes of those, who, guided by more profound       contemplations, have fathomed all the fallacies of the new       observations and recognized their impossibility! I cannot resolve       what to say in a chance so strange, so new, so unexpected. The       shortness of time, the unexampled occurrence, the weakness of my       intellect, the terror of being mistaken, have greatly confounded       me.\"    However, he plucked up courage, and conjectured that the two attendants  would reappear, by revolving round the planet.    [Illustration: FIG. 50.--Saturn and his rings, as seen under the most  favourable circumstances.]    The real reason of their disappearance is well known to us now. The  plane of Saturn's rings oscillates slowly about our line of sight, and  so we sometimes see them edgeways and sometimes with a moderate amount  of obliquity. The rings are so thin that, when turned precisely  edgeways, they become invisible. The two imaginary attendants were the  most conspicuous portions of the ring, subsequently called _ansae_.    I have thought it better not to interrupt this catalogue of brilliant  discoveries by any biographical details; but we must now retrace our  steps to the years 1609 and 1610, the era of the invention of the  telescope.    By this time Galileo had been eighteen years at Padua, and like many  another man in like case, was getting rather tired of continual  lecturing. Moreover, he felt so full of ideas that he longed to have a  better opportunity of following them up, and more time for thinking them  out.    Now in the holidays he had been accustomed to return to his family home  at Pisa, and there to come a good deal into contact with the Grand-Ducal  House of Tuscany. Young Cosmo di Medici became in fact his pupil, and  arrived at man's estate with the highest opinion of the philosopher.  This young man had now come to the throne as Cosmo II., and to him  Galileo wrote saying how much he should like more time and leisure, how  full he was of discoveries if he only had the chance of a reasonable  income without the necessity of consuming so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28617"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science February 1930 (#18)"],[1,"and brilliant mind.\"    Northwood blushed hotly. \"You'll have to arrange a meeting between us.\"    \"I have.\" The professor's thin, dry lips pursed comically. \"He'll drop  in to see you within a few days.\"    And now John Northwood sat holding Dr. Mundson's card and the wallet  which the scientist had so mysteriously dropped at his feet.           *       *       *       *       *    Here was high adventure, perhaps, for which he had been singled out by  the famous electrical wizard. While excitement mounted in his blood,  Northwood again examined the photograph. The girl's strange eyes, odd in  expression rather than in size or shape, seemed to hold him. The young  man's breath came quicker.    \"It's a challenge,\" he said softly. \"It won't hurt to see what it's all  about.\"    His watch showed eleven o'clock. He would return the wallet that night.  Into his coat pocket he slipped a revolver. One sometimes needed weapons  in Indian Court.    He took a taxi, which soon turned from the well-lighted streets into a  section where squalid houses crowded against each other, and dirty  children swarmed in the streets in their last games of the day.    Indian Court was little more than an alley, dark and evil smelling.    The chauffeur stopped at the entrance and said:    \"If I drive in, I'll have to back out, sir. Number forty-four and a half  is the end house, facing the entrance.\"    \"You've been here before?\" asked Northwood.    \"Last week I drove the queerest bird here--a fellow as good-looking as  you, who had me follow the taxi occupied by a hunchback with a face  like Old Nick.\" The man hesitated and went on haltingly: \"It might sound  goofy, mister, but there was something funny about my fare. He jumped  out, asked me the charge, and, in the moment I glanced at my taxi-meter,  he disappeared. Yes, sir. Vanished, owing me four dollars, six bits. It  was almost ghostlike, mister.\"    Northwood laughed nervously and dismissed him. He found his number and  knocked at the dilapidated door. He heard a sudden movement in the  lighted room beyond, and the door opened quickly.    Dr. Mundson faced him.    \"I knew you'd come!\" he said with a slight Teutonic accent. \"Often I'm  not wrong in sizing up my man. Come in.\"    Northwood cleared his throat awkwardly. \"You dropped your wallet at my  feet, Dr. Mundson. I tried to stop you before you got away, but I guess  you did not hear me.\"    He offered the wallet, but the hunchback waved it aside.    \"A ruse, of course,\" he confessed. \"It just was my way of testing what  your Professor Michael told about you--that you are extraordinarily  intelligent, virile, and imaginative. Had you sent the wallet to me, I  should have sought elsewhere for my man. Come in.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Northwood followed him into a living room evidently recently furnished  in a somewhat hurried manner. The furniture, although rich, was not  placed to best advantage. The new rug was a trifle crooked on the floor,  and the lamp shades clashed in color with the other furnishings.    Dr. Mundson's intense eyes swept over Northwood's tall, slim body.    \"Ah, you're a man!\" he said softly. \"You are what all men would be if we  followed Nature's plan that only the fit shall survive. But modern  science is permitting the unfit to live and to mix their defective  beings with the developing race!\" His huge fist gesticulated madly.  \"Fools! Fools! They need me and perfect men like you.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because you can help me in my plan to populate the earth with a new  race of godlike people. But don't question me too closely now. Even if I  should explain, you would call me insane. But watch; gradually I shall  unfold the mystery before you, so that you will believe.\"    He reached for the wallet that Northwood still held, opened it with a  monstrous hand, and reached for the photograph. \"She shall bring you  love. She's more beautiful than a poet's dream.\"    A warm flush crept over the young man's face.    \"I can easily understand,\" he said, \"how a man could love her, but for  me she comes too late.\"    \"Pooh! Fiddlesticks!\" The scientist snapped his fingers. \"This girl was  created for you. That other--you will forget her the moment you set eyes  on the sweet flesh of this Athalia. She is an houri from Paradise--a  maiden of musk and incense.\" He held the girl's photograph toward the  young man. \"Keep it. She is yours, if you are strong enough to hold  her.\"    Northwood opened his card case and placed the picture inside, facing  Mary's photograph. Again the warning words of the mysterious stranger  rang in his memory: \"_The thing inside never will be yours._\"    \"Where to,\" he said eagerly; \"and when do we start?\"    \"To the new Garden of Eden,\" said the scientist, with such a beatific  smile that his face was less hideous. \"We start immediately. I have  arranged with Professor Michael for you to go.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Northwood followed Dr. Mundson to the street and walked with him a few  blocks to a garage where the scientist's motor car waited.    \"The apartment in Indian Court is just a little eccentricity of mine,\"  explained Dr. Mundson. \"I need people in my work, people whom I must  select through swift, sure tests. The apartment comes in handy, as  to-night.\"    Northwood scarcely noted where they were going, or how long they had  been on the way. He was vaguely aware that they had left the city  behind, and were now passing through farms bathed in moonlight.    At last they entered a path that led through a bit of woodland. For half  a mile the path continued, and then ended at a small, enclosed field. In  the middle of this rested a queer aircraft. Northwood knew it was a  flying machine only by the propellers mounted on the top of the huge  ball-shaped body. There were no wings, no birdlike hull, no tail.    \"It looks almost like a little world ready to fly off into space,\" he  commented.    \"It is just about that.\" The scientist's squat, bunched-out body,  settled squarely on long, thin, straddled legs, looked gnomelike in the  moonlight. \"One cannot copy flesh with steel and wood, but one can make  metal perform magic of which flesh is not capable. My sun-ship is not a  mechanical reproduction of a bird. It is--but, climb in, young friend.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Northwood followed Dr. Mundson into the aircraft. The moment the  scientist closed the metal door behind them, Northwood was instantly  aware of some concealed horror that vibrated through his nerves. For one  dreadful moment, he expected some terrific agent of the shadows that  escaped the electric lights to leap upon him. And this was odd, for  nothing could be saner than the globular interior of the aircraft,  divided into four wedge-shaped apartments.    Dr. Mundson also paused at the door, puzzled, hesitant.    \"Someone has been here!\" he exclaimed. \"Look, Northwood! The bunk has  been occupied--the one in this cabin I had set aside for you.\"    He pointed to the disarranged bunk, where the impression of a head could  still be seen on a pillow.    \"A tramp, perhaps.\"    \"No! The door was locked, and, as you saw, the fence around this field  was protected with barbed wire. There's something wrong. I felt it on my  trip here all the way, like someone watching me in the dark. And don't  laugh! I have stopped laughing at all things that seem unnatural. You  don't know what is natural.\"    Northwood shivered. \"Maybe someone is concealed about the ship.\"    \"Impossible. Me, I thought so, too. But I looked and looked, and there  was nothing.\"    All evening Northwood had burned to tell the scientist about the  handsome stranger in the Mad Hatter Club. But even now he shrank from  saying that a man had vanished before his eyes.    Dr. Mundson was working with a succession of buttons and levers. There  was a slight jerk, and then the strange craft shot up, straight as a  bullet from a gun, with scarcely a sound other than a continuous  whistle.    \"The vertical rising aircraft perfected,\" explained Dr. Mundson. \"But  what would you think if I told you that there is not an ounce of  gasoline in my heavier-than-air craft?\"    \"I shouldn't be surprised. An electrical genius would seek for a less  obsolete source of power.\"           *       *       *       *       *    In the bright flare of the electric lights, the scientist's ugly face  flushed. \"The man who harnesses the sun rules the world. He can make the  desert places bloom, the frozen poles balmy and verdant. You, John  Northwood, are one of the very few to fly in a machine operated solely  by electrical energy from the sun's rays.\"    \"Are you telling me that this airship is operated with power from the  sun?\"    \"Yes. And I cannot take the credit for its invention.\" He sighed. \"The  dream was mine, but a greater brain developed it--a brain that may be  greater than I suspect.\" His face grew suddenly graver.    A little later Northwood said: \"It seems that we must be making fabulous  speed.\"    \"Perhaps!\" Dr. Mundson worked with the controls. \"Here, I've cut her  down to the average speed of the ordinary airplane. Now you can see a  bit of the night scenery.\"    Northwood peeped out the thick glass porthole. Far below, he saw two  tiny streaks of light, one smooth and stationery, the other wavering as  though it were a reflection in water.    \"That can't be a lighthouse!\" he cried.    The scientist glanced out. \"It is. We're approaching the Florida Keys.\"    \"Impossible! We've been traveling less than an hour.\"    \"But, my young friend, do you realize that my sun-ship has a speed of  over one thousand miles an hour, how much over I dare not tell you?\"    Throughout the night, Northwood sat beside Dr. Mundson, watching his  deft fingers control the simple-looking buttons and levers. So fast was  their flight now that, through the portholes, sky and earth looked the  same: dark gray films of"]]]
