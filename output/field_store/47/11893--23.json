[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2743"],[0,"Massacres of the South (1551-1815) (#18)"],[1," twelve guards dressed in red; and as his  colleague Roland had taken the title of Comte, he allowed himself to be  called Duke of the Cevennes.    At his approach half of the garrison, which was commanded by M. de  Maillan, took possession of the church and half of the citadel; but as  Cavalier was more bent on obtaining food and rest for his soldiers than  of disturbing the town, he billeted his men on the townspeople, and  placed sentinels at the church and fortress, who exchanged shots all the  night through with the royal troops. The next morning, having destroyed  the fortifications, he marched out of the town again, drums beating and  flags flying as before. When almost in sight of Nimes he made his  troops, which had never before been so numerous or so brilliant, perform  a great many evolutions, and then continued his way towards Nages.    M de Montrevel received a report at nine o'clock in the morning of the  direction Cavalier and his troops had taken, and immediately left  Sommieres, followed by six companies of Fimarqon dragoons, one hundred  Irish free-lances, three hundred rank and file of the Hainault regiment,  and one company each of the Soissonnais, Charolais, and Menon regiments,  forming in all a corps over nine hundred strong. They took the direction  of Vaunages, above Clarensac; but suddenly hearing the rattle of  musketry behind them, they wheeled and made for Langlade.    They found that Grandval had already encountered the Camisards. These  being fatigued had withdrawn into a hollow between Boissieres and the  windmill at Langlade, in order to rest. The infantry lay down, their  arms beside them; the cavalry placed themselves at the feet of their  horses, the bridle on arm. Cavalier himself, Cavalier the indefatigable,  broken by the fatigues of the preceding days, had fallen asleep, with  his young brother watching beside him. Suddenly he felt himself shaken  by the arm, and rousing up, he heard on all sides cries of \"Kill! Kill!\"  and \"To arms! To arms!\" Grandval and his men, who had been sent to find  out where the Camisards were, had suddenly come upon them.    The infantry formed, the cavalry sprang to their saddles, Cavalier  leaped on his horse, and drawing his sword, led his soldiers as usual  against the dragoons, and these, as was also usual, ran away, leaving  twelve of their number dead on the field. The Camisard cavalry soon gave  up the pursuit, as they found themselves widely separated from the  infantry and from their leader; for Cavalier had been unable to keep up  with them, his horse having received a bullet through its neck.    Still they followed the flying dragoons for a good hour, from time to  time a wounded dragoon falling from his horse, till at last the Camisard  cavalry found itself confronted by the Charolais regiment, drawn up in  battle array, and behind them the royal dragoons, who had taken refuge  there, and were re-forming.    Carried on by the rapidity of their course, the Camisards could not pull  up till they were within a hundred yards of the enemy; they fired once,  killing several, then turned round and retreated.    When a third of the way, back had been covered, they met their chief,  who had found a fresh horse by the wayside standing beside its dead  master. He arrived at full gallop, as he was anxious to unite his  cavalry and infantry at once, as he had seen the forces of the marechal  advancing, who, as we have already said, had turned in the direction of  the firing. Hardly had Cavalier effected the desired junction of his  forces than he perceived that his retreat was cut off. He had the royal  troops both before and behind him.    The young chief saw that a desperate dash to right or left was all that  remained to him, and not knowing this country as well as the Cevennes,  he asked a peasant the way from Soudorgues to Nages, that being the only  one by which he could escape. There was no time to inquire whether the  peasant was Catholic or Protestant; he could only trust to chance, and  follow the road indicated. But a few yards from the spot where the road  from Doudorgues to Nages joins the road to Nimes he found himself in  face of Marechal Montrevel's troops under the command of Menon. However,  as they hardly outnumbered the Camisards, these did not stop to look for  another route, but bending forward in their saddles, they dashed through  the lines at full gallop, taking the direction of Nages, hoping to reach  the plain round Calvisson. But the village, the approaches, the issues  were all occupied by royal troops, and at the same time Grandval and the  marechal joined forces, while Menon collected his men together and  pushed forward. Cavalier was completely surrounded: he gave the  situation a comprehensive glance--his foes, were five to one.    Rising in his stirrups, so that he could see over every head, Cavalier  shouted so loud that not only his own men heard but also those of the  enemy: \"My children, if our hearts fail us now, we shall be taken and  broken on the wheel. There is only one means of safety: we must cut our  way at full gallop through these people. Follow me, and keep close  order!\"    So speaking, he dashed on the nearest group, followed by all his men,  who formed a compact mass; round which the three corps of royal troops  closed. Then there was everywhere a hand-to-hand battle there was no  time to load and fire; swords flashed and fell, bayonets stabbed, the  royals and the Camisards took each other by the throat and hair. For an  hour this demoniac fight lasted, during which Cavalier lost five hundred  men and slew a thousand of the enemy. At last he won through, followed  by about two hundred of his troops, and drew a long breath; but finding  himself in the centre of a large circle of soldiers, he made for a  bridge, where alone it seemed possible to break through, it being only  guarded by a hundred dragoons.    He divided his men into two divisions, one to force the bridge, the  other to cover the retreat. Then he faced his foes like a wild boar  driven to bay.    Suddenly loud shouts behind him announced that the bridge was forced;  but the Camisards, instead of keeping the passage open for their leader,  scattered over the plain and sought safety in flight. But a child threw  himself before them, pistol in hand. It was Cavalier's young brother,  mounted on one of the small wild horses of Camargues of that Arab breed  which was introduced into Languedoc by the Moors from Spain. Carrying a  sword and carbine proportioned to his size, the boy addressed the flying  men. \"Where are you going?\" he cried, \"Instead of running away like  cowards, line the river banks and oppose the enemy to facilitate my  brother's escape.\" Ashamed of having deserved such reproaches, the  Camisards stopped, rallied, lined the banks of the river, and by keeping  up a steady fire, covered Cavalier's retreat, who crossed without having  received a single wound, though his horse was riddled with bullets and  he had been forced to change his sword three times.    Still the combat raged; but gradually Cavalier managed to retreat: a  plain cut by trenches, the falling darkness, a wood which afforded  cover, all combined to help him at last. Still his rearguard, harassed  by the enemy, dotted the ground it passed over with its dead, until at  last both victors and vanquished were swallowed up by night. The fight  had lasted ten hours, Cavalier had lost more than five hundred men, and  the royals about a thousand.    \"Cavalier,\" says M. de Villars, in his Memoirs, \"acted on this day in a  way which astonished everyone. For who could help being astonished to  see a nobody, inexperienced in the art of warfare, bear himself in such  difficult and trying circumstances like some great general? At one  period of the day he was followed everywhere by a dragoon; Cavalier shot  at him and killed his horse. The dragoon returned the shot, but missed.  Cavalier had two horses killed under him; the first time he caught a  dragoon's horse, the second time he made one of his own men dismount and  go on foot.\"    M de Montrevel also showed himself to be a gallant soldier; wherever  there was danger there was he, encouraging officers and soldiers by his  example: one Irish captain was killed at his side, another fatally  wounded, and a third slightly hurt. Grandval, on his part, had performed  miracles: his horse was shot under him, and M. de Montrevel replaced it  by one of great value, on which he joined in the pursuit of the  Camisards. After this affair M. de Montrevel gave up his place to M. de  Villars, leaving word for Cavalier that it was thus he took leave of his  friends.    Although Cavalier came out of this battle with honour, compelling even  his enemies to regard him as a man worthy of their steel, it had  nevertheless destroyed the best part of his hopes. He made a halt-near  Pierredon to gather together the remnant of his troops, and truly it was  but a remnant which remained. Of those who came back the greater number  were without weapons, for they had thrown them away in their flight.  Many were incapacitated for service by their wounds; and lastly, the  cavalry could hardly be said to exist any longer, as the few men who  survived had been obliged to abandon their horses, in order to get  across the high ditches which were their only cover from the dragoons  during the flight.    Meantime the royalists were very active, and Cavalier felt that it would  be imprudent to remain long at Pierredon, so setting out during the  night, and crossing the Gardon, he buried himself in the forest of  Hieuzet, whither he hoped his enemies would not venture to follow him.  And in fact the first two days were quiet, and his troops benefited  greatly by the rest, especially as they were able to draw stores of all  kinds--wheat, hay, arms, and ammunition--from an immense cave which the  Camisards had used for a long time as a magazine and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2744"],[0,"Mary Stuart (#18)"],[1,"s, our children, our friends, our  servants, our vassals, our goods, our persons, and our lives, to restore  her to liberty, to procure the safety of the prince, and to co-operate  in punishing the late king's murderers. If we are assailed for this  intent, whether as a body or in private, we promise to defend ourselves,  and to aid one another, under pain of infamy and perjury. So may God  help us.    \"Given with our own hands at Dumbarton,    \"St. Andrews, Argyll, Huntly, Arbroath, Galloway, Ross, Fleming,  Herries, Stirling, Kilwinning, Hamilton, and Saint-Clair, Knight.\"    \"And Seyton!\" cried Mary, \"among all these signatures, I do not see that  of my faithful Seyton.\"    Douglas, still kneeling, drew from his breast a second paper, and  presented it to the queen with the same marks of respect. It contained  only these few words:    \"Trust George Douglas; for your Majesty has no more devoted friend in  the entire kingdom. \"SEYTON.\"    Mary lowered her eyes to Douglas with an expression which was hers only;  then, giving him her hand to raise him--    \"Ah!\" said she, with a sigh more of joy than of sadness, \"now I see that  God, in spite of my faults, has not yet abandoned me. But how is it, in  this castle, that you, a Douglas.... oh! it is incredible!\"    \"Madam,\" replied George, \"seven years have passed since I saw you in  France for the first time, and for seven years I have loved you\". Mary  moved; but Douglas put forth his hand and shook his head with an air of  such profound sadness, that she understood that she might hear what the  young man had to say. He continued: \"Reassure yourself, madam; I should  never have made this confession if, while explaining my conduct to you,  this confession would not have given you greater confidence in me. Yes,  for seven years I have loved you, but as one loves a star that one can  never reach, a madonna to whom one can only pray; for seven years I have  followed you everywhere without you ever having paid attention to me,  without my saying a word or making a gesture to attract your notice. I  was on the knight of Mevillon's galley when you crossed to Scotland; I  was among the regent's soldiers when you beat Huntly; I was in the  escort which accompanied you when you went to see the sick king at  Glasgow; I reached Edinburgh an hour after you had left it for  Lochleven; and then it seemed to me that my mission was revealed to me  for the first time, and that this love for which till then, I had  reproached myself as a crime, was on the contrary a favour from God. I  learned that the lords were assembled at Dumbarton: I flew thither. I  pledged my name, I pledged my honour, I pledged my life; and I obtained  from them, thanks to the facility I had for coming into this fortress,  the happiness of bringing you the paper they have just signed. Now,  madam, forget all I have told you, except the assurance of my devotion  and respect: forget that I am near you; I am used to not being seen:  only, if you have need of my life, make a sign; for seven years my life  has been yours.\"    \"Alas!\" replied Mary, \"I was complaining this morning of no longer being  loved, and I ought to complain, on the contrary, that I am still loved;  for the love that I inspire is fatal and mortal. Look back, Douglas, and  count the tombs that, young as I am, I have already left on my  path--Francis II, Chatelard, Rizzio, Darnley.... Oh to attach one's self  to my fortunes more than love is needed now heroism and devotion are  requisite so much the more that, as you have said, Douglas, it is love  without any possible reward. Do you understand?\"    \"Oh, madam, madam,\" answered Douglas, \"is it not reward beyond my  deserts to see you daily, to cherish the hope that liberty will be  restored to you through me, and to have at least, if I do not give it  you, the certainty of dying in your sight?\"    \"Poor young man!\" murmured Mary, her eyes raised to heaven, as if she  were reading there beforehand the fate awaiting her new defender.    \"Happy Douglas, on the contrary,\" cried George, seizing the queen's hand  and kissing it with perhaps still more respect than love, \"happy  Douglas! for in obtaining a sigh from your Majesty he has already  obtained more than he hoped.\"    \"And upon what have you decided with my friends?\" said the queen,  raising Douglas, who till then had remained on his knees before her.    \"Nothing yet,\" George replied; \"for we scarcely had time to see one  another. Your escape, impossible without me, is difficult even with me;  and your Majesty has seen that I was obliged publicly to fail in  respect, to obtain from my mother the confidence which gives me the good  fortune of seeing you to-day: if this confidence on my mother's or my  brother's part ever extends to giving up to me the castle keys, then you  are saved! Let your Majesty not be surprised at anything, then: in the  presence of others, I shall ever be always a Douglas, that is an enemy;  and except your life be in danger, madam, I shall not utter a word, I  shall not make a gesture which might betray the faith that I have sworn  you; but, on your side, let your grace know well, that present or  absent, whether I am silent or speak, whether I act or remain inert, all  will be in appearance only, save my devotion. Only,\" continued Douglas,  approaching the window and showing to the queen a little house on  Kinross hill,--\"only, look every evening in that direction, madam, and  so long as you see a light shine there, your friends will be keeping  watch for you, and you need not lose hope.\"    \"Thanks, Douglas, thanks,\" said the queen; \"it does one good to meet  with a heart like yours from time to time--oh! thanks.\"    \"And now, madam,\" replied the young man, \"I must leave your Majesty; to  remain longer with you would be to raise suspicions, and a single doubt  of me, think of it well, madam, and that light which is your sole beacon  is extinguished, and all returns into night.\"    With these words, Douglas bowed more respectfully than he had yet done,  and withdrew, leaving Mary full of hope, and still more full of pride;  for this time the homage that she had just received was certainly for  the woman and not for the queen.    As the queen had told him, Mary Seyton was informed of everything, even  the love of Douglas, and, the two women impatiently awaited the evening  to see if the promised star would shine on the horizon. Their hope was  not in vain: at the appointed time the beacon was lit. The queen  trembled with joy, for it was the confirmation of her hopes, and her  companion could not tear her from the window, where she remained with  her gaze fastened on the little house in Kinross. At last she yielded to  Mary Seyton's prayers, and consented to go to bed; but twice in the  night she rose noiselessly to go to the window: the light was always  shining, and was not extinguished till dawn, with its sisters the stars.    Next day, at breakfast, George announced to the queen the return of his  brother, William Douglas: he arrived the same evening; as to himself,  George, he had to leave Lochleven next morning, to confer with the  nobles who had signed the declaration, and who had immediately separated  to raise troops in their several counties. The queen could not attempt  to good purpose any escape but at a time when she would be sure of  gathering round her an army strong enough to hold the country; as to  him, Douglas, one was so used to his silent disappearances and to his  unexpected returns, that there was no reason to fear that his departure  would inspire any suspicion.    All passed as George had said: in the evening the sound of a bugle  announced the arrival of William Douglas; he had with him Lord Ruthven,  the son of him who had assassinated Rizzio, and who, exiled with Morton  after the murder, died in England of the sickness with which he was  already attacked the day of the terrible catastrophe in which we have  seen him take such a large share. He preceded by one day Lord Lindsay of  Byres and Sir Robert Melville, brother of Mary's former ambassador to  Elizabeth: all three were charged with a mission from the regent to the  queen.    On the following day everything fell back into the usual routine, and  William Douglas reassumed his duties as carver. Breakfast passed without  Mary's having learned anything of George's departure or Ruthven's  arrival. On rising from the table she went to her window: scarcely was  she there than she heard the sound of a horn echoing on the shores of  the lake, and saw a little troop of horsemen halt, while waiting for the  boat to come and take those who were going to the castle.    The distance was too great for Mary to recognise any of the visitors;  but it was clear, from the signs of intelligence exchanged between the  little troop and the inhabitants of the fortress, that the newcomers  were her enemies. This was a reason why the queen, in her uneasiness,  should not lose sight for a moment of the boat which was going to fetch  them. She saw only two men get into it; and immediately it put off again  for the castle.    As the boat drew nearer, Mary's presentiments changed to real fears, for  in one of the men coming towards her she thought she made out Lord  Lindsay of Byres, the same who, a week before, had brought her to her  prison. It was indeed he himself, as usual in a steel helmet without a  visor, which allowed one to see his coarse face designed to express  strong passions, and his long black beard with grey hairs here and  there, which covered his chest: his person was protected, as if it were  in time of war, with his faithful suit of armour, formerly polished and  well gilded, but which, exposed without ceasing to rain and mist, was  now eaten up with rust; he had slung on his back, much as one slings a  quiver, a broadsword, so heavy that it took two hands to manage it, and  so long that while the hilt reached the left shoulder the point"]]]
