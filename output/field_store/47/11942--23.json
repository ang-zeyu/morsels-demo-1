BRANT. _Branta bernicla glaucogastra._    Range.--Eastern North America, breeding in the Arctic regions and  wintering in the United States east of the Mississippi.    The Brant resembles a small Canada Goose, except that the black of the  neck extends on the breast, and only the throat is white. They are one  of the favorite game birds and thousands are shot every fall and spring.  Their nests and eggs are the same as the next species.      174. BLACK BRANT. _Branta nigricans._    Range.--Western North America, breeding in Alaska and wintering on the  Pacific coast of the United States. Rare east of the Mississippi.      This species is like the last except that the black extends on the under  parts. This species nests very abundantly in northern Alaska, laying  their eggs in a depression in the ground, lined with down. Favorite  locations are the many small islets in ponds and small lakes. They lay  from four to eight grayish colored eggs. Size 2.80 x 1.75. Data.--Cape  Bathurst, North West Territory, Junes 22, 1901. Seven eggs in a small  hollow in the ground, lined with down. Collector, Capt. H. H. Bodfish.    [Illustration 113: Brant. Black Brant.]  [Illustration: Grayish.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 112    175. BARNACLE GOOSE. _Branta leucopsis._    This Old World species occurs frequently in Greenland and very rarely is  found on the mainland of this continent.      176. EMPEROR GOOSE. _Philacte canagica._    Range.--Alaska, south in winter casually to California.    This handsome species is twenty-six inches in length; it may be known  from the mottled or \"scaly\" appearance of the body, and the white head  with a black chin and throat. While not uncommon in restricted  localities, this may be considered as one of the most rare of North  American Geese. Their nests are built upon the ground and do not differ  from those of other geese. They lay from three to seven eggs of a dull  buff color. Size 3.10 x 2.15. Data.--Stuart Island, Alaska, June 16,  1900. Six eggs laid in a slight hollow in the ground, lined with a few  feathers and some down. Collector, Capt. H. H. Bodfish.

BLACK-BELLIED TREE-DUCK. _Dendrocygna autumnalis._    Range.--Tropical America, north in the Rio Grande Valley to southern  Texas.    These peculiar long-legged Ducks are very abundant in southern Texas  during the summer months. They build their nests in hollow trees, often  quite a distance from the water. They lay their eggs upon the bottom of  the cavity with only a scant lining, if any, of feathers and down. They  are very prolific breeders, raising two broods in a season, each set of  eggs containing from ten to twenty. These eggs are creamy or pure white,  size 2.05 x 1.50. The first set is laid during the latter part of April  or early in May, and fresh eggs may be found as late as July. They are  especially abundant about Brownsville and Corpus Christi, Texas.  Data.--Hidalgo, Mexico, May 29, 1900. Ten eggs in a hole in an old elm  tree on side of lake in big woods near town. Eight feet from the ground.  Collector, F. B. Armstrong.      178. FULVOUS TREE-DUCK. _Dendrocygna bicolor._    Range.--This species is tropical like the last, but the summer range is  extended to cover, casually the whole southwestern border of the United  States.    This bird is long-legged like the last, but the plumage is entirely  different, being of a general rusty color, including the entire under  parts. The nesting habits and eggs are the same as those of the  Black-bellied Duck, the white eggs being laid at the bottom of a cavity  in a tree. They number from eight to (in one instance) thirty-two eggs  in one nest. This species is nearly as abundant as the preceding in  southern Texas.

WHOOPER SWAN. _Olor cygnus._    This European variety frequently is found in Greenland and formerly,  regularly bred there. It nests in secluded swampy places in northern  Europe.      180. WHISTLING SWAN. _Olor columbianus._.    Range.--North America, breeding in the Arctic Circle, and wintering  south to the Gulf of Mexico.    These birds, which are nearly five feet in length, are snow white with  the exception of the black bill and feet. The Whistling Swan is  distinguished from the next species by the presence of a small yellow  spot on either side of the bill near its base. Their nests are made of a  large mass of rubbish, weeds, grass, moss, feathers and occasionally a  few sticks. It is generally placed in a somewhat marshy place in the  neighborhood of some isolated pond. The eggs are of a greenish or  brownish buff color, and number from three to six. Size 4.00 x 2.75.  Data.--Mackenzie River. Nest a mass of weeds, sods and grass, lined with  feathers; on an island near the mouth of the river. Collector, I. O.  Stringer.      181. TRUMPETER SWAN. _Olor buccinator._    Range.--Interior of North America from the Gulf of Mexico northward,  breeding from northern United States northward.    This is a magnificent bird, about five and one-half feet in length. Its  plumage is exactly like that of the preceding except that the bill is  entirely black, and the nostril is located nearer the eye. Their nesting  habits and eggs are the same as those of the Whistling Swan. While a few  pairs may breed within the United States by far the greater number are  found in the extreme north, from Hudson Bay to Alaska. The eggs may  average a trifle larger than those of the preceding species.

Family PHOENICOPTERIDAE      182. FLAMINGO. _Phoenicopterus ruber._    Range.--Tropical and sub-tropical America on the Atlantic coasts,  breeding in the Bahamas and West Indies; north to Florida and casually  to the South Atlantic States.    These remarkable and grotesque appearing birds attain a length of about  48 inches. The plumage varies from white to a deep rosy red. It requires  several years for them to attain the perfect adult plumage, and unlike  most birds, they are in the best of plumage during the winter, the  colors becoming faded as the nesting season approaches. The birds are  especially noticeable because of the crooked, hollow, scoop-shaped bill,  and the extremely long legs and neck. The feet are webbed, but more for  the purpose of supporting them upon the mud flats than for use in  swimming. The nests are usually built on a sandy point of an island;  they are mounds of earth, grass and rubbish from one to two feet in  height, the top being hollowed to receive the eggs. One or two eggs are  a complete set. The shell is pale blue, but this is covered with a heavy  white chalky deposit. The eggs are laid in June and July. Size 3.40 x  2.15.      IBISES, STORKS, HERONS, etc. Order VII. HERODIONES    The members of this order are wading birds, consequently they all have  long legs and necks. They have four toes, not webbed.    SPOONBILLS. Family PLATALEIDAE      183. ROSEATE SPOONBILL. _Ajaia ajaja._.    Range.--Tropical America, north in summer to the Gulf States. They  formerly nested in remote swamps along the whole Gulf coast, but are now  confined chiefly to the Everglades in Florida.    [Illustration 117: American Flamingo. Roseate Spoonbill.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 116    This bird, with its broad, flat bill, bare head, and rosy plumage with  carmine epaulets and tail coverts, seem more like the fanciful creation  of some artist than a real bird of flesh and blood. Its plumage and  colors are strikingly clear and beautiful. Full plumaged adult birds  have very brilliant carmine shoulders and tail coverts, a saffron  colored tail, and a lengthened tuft of bright rosy feathers on the  foreneck. This species breed in small colonies in marshy places, often  in company with herons and ibises. Their nests are rather frail  platforms of sticks, located in bushes or trees, from four to fifteen  feet from the ground. The eggs are laid during the latter part of May  and June. They are three or four in number and have a ground color of  dull white, or pale greenish blue and are quite heavily blotched with  several shades of brown. Size 2.50 x 1.70.    [Illustration 118: Pale greenish blue.]  [Illustration: Chalky bluish white. Egg of American Flamingo.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 117    IBISES. Family IBIDIDAE    Ibises are gracefully formed birds having a long curved bill and a bare  face.      184. WHITE IBIS. _Guara alba._    Range.--This is a tropical and sub-tropical species which is found along  the Gulf coast, and north to South Carolina, west to Lower California.    These handsome birds are wholly white, with the exception of black  primaries. The legs and the bare skin of the face is orange red. These  birds are very abundant in most marshy localities along the Gulf coast,  especially in Florida, where they nest in rookeries of thousands of  individuals. Owing to their not having plumes, they have not been  persecuted as have the white herons. They build their nests of sticks  and grasses, in the mangroves a few feet above the water. In other  localities they build their nests entirely of dead rushes,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30003"],[0,"Law and Laughter (#18)"],[1,"the English  language!\"--\"Not so bad as that,\" replied Curran. \"He has only knocked  an 'i' out.\"    Curran never joined the hunt, except once, not far from Dublin. His  horse joined very keenly in the sport, but the horseman was inwardly  hoping all the while that the dogs would not find. In the midst of his  career, the hounds broke into a potato field of a wealthy land-agent,  who happened to have been severely cross-examined by Curran some days  before. The fellow came up patronisingly and said, \"Oh sure, you are  Counsellor Curran, the great lawyer. Now then, Mr. Lawyer, can you tell  me by what law you are trespassing on my ground?\"--\"By what law, did you  ask, Mr. Maloney?\" replied Curran. \"It must be the _Lex Tally-ho-nis_,  to be sure.\"    During one of the Circuits, Curran was dining with a brother advocate at  a small inn kept by a worthy woman known by the Christian name of  Honoria, or, as it is generally called, Honor. The gentlemen were so  pleased with their entertainment that they summoned Honor to receive  their compliments and drink a glass of wine with them. She attended at  once, and Curran after a brief eulogium on the dinner filled a glass,  and handing it to the landlady proposed as a toast \"Honor and Honesty,\"  to which the lady with an arch smile added, \"Our absent friends,\" drank  off her amended toast and withdrew.    He happened one day to have for his companion in a stage-coach a very  vulgar and revolting old woman, who seemed to have been encrusted with a  prejudice against Ireland and all its inhabitants. Curran sat chafing in  silence in his corner. At last, suddenly, a number of cows, with their  tails and heads in the air, kept rushing up and down the road in  alarming proximity to the coach windows. The old woman manifestly was  but ill at ease. At last, unable to restrain her terror, she faltered  out, \"Oh dear; oh dear, sir! what can the cows mean?\"--\"Faith, my good  woman,\" replied Curran, \"as there's an Irishman in the coach, I  shouldn't wonder if they were on the outlook for _a bull_!\"    Curran was once asked what an Irish gentleman, just arrived in England,  could mean by perpetually putting out his tongue. \"I suppose,\" replied  the wit, \"he's trying _to catch the English accent_.\"    During the temporary separation of Lord Avonmore and Curran, Egan  espoused the judge's imaginary quarrel so bitterly that a duel was the  consequence. The parties met, and on the ground Egan complained that the  disparity in their sizes gave his antagonist a manifest advantage. \"I  might as well fire at a razor's edge as at him,\" said Egan, \"and he may  hit me as easily as a turf-stack.\"--\"I'll tell you what, Mr. Egan,\"  replied Curran; \"I wish to take no advantage of you--let my _size_ be  _chalked_ out upon your side, and I am quite content that every shot  which hits outside that mark should _go for nothing_.\" And in another  duel, in which his opponent was a major who had taken offence at some  remark the eminent counsel had made about him in Court, the major asked  Curran to fire first. \"No,\" replied Curran, \"I am here on your  invitation, so you must _open the ball_.\"    Sir Thomas Furton, who was a respectable speaker, but certainly nothing  more, affected once to discuss the subject of eloquence with Curran,  assuming an equality by no means palatable to the latter. Curran  happening to mention, as a peculiarity of his, that he could not speak  above a quarter of an hour without requiring something to moisten his  lips, Sir Thomas, pursuing his comparisons, declared _he_ had the  advantage in that respect. \"I spoke,\" said he, \"the other night in the  Commons for five hours on the Nabob of Oude, and never felt in the least  thirsty.\"--\"It is very remarkable, indeed,\" replied Curran, \"for  everyone agrees that was the _driest_ speech of the session.\"    Lord Clare (says Mr. Hayward) had a favourite dog which was permitted to  follow him to the Bench. One day, during an argument of Curran's, the  Chancellor turned aside and began to fondle the dog, with the obvious  view of intimating inattention or disregard. The counsel stopped; the  judge looked up: \"I beg your pardon,\" continued Curran, \"I thought your  lordship had been in consultation.\"    Curran often raised a laugh at Lord Norbury's expense. The laws, at that  period, made capital punishment so general that nearly all crimes were  punishable with death by the rope. It was remarked Lord Norbury never  hesitated to condemn the convicted prisoner to the gallows. Dining in  company with Curran, who was carving some corned beef, Lord Norbury  inquired, \"Is that hung beef, Mr. Curran?\"--\"Not yet, my lord,\" was the  reply; \"you have not _tried_ it.\"    \"A doldrum, Mr. Curran! What does the witness mean by saying you put him  in a doldrum?\" asked Lord Avonmore. \"Oh, my lord, it is a very common  complaint with persons of this description; it's merely a confusion of  the head arising from a corruption of the heart.\"    Angered one day in debate, he put his hand on his heart, saying, \"I am  the trusty guardian of my own honour.\"--\"Then,\" replied Sir Boyle Roche,  \"I congratulate my honourable friend in the snug little sinecure to  which he has appointed himself.\"    But on one occasion he met his match in a pert, jolly, keen-eyed son of  Erin, who was up as a witness in a case of dispute in the matter of a  horse deal. Curran was anxious to break down the credibility of this  witness, and thought to do it by making the man contradict himself--by  tangling him up in a network of adroitly framed questions--but to no  avail. The ostler's good common sense, and his equanimity and good  nature, were not to be upset. Presently, Curran, in a towering rage,  thundered forth, as no other counsel would have dared to do in the  presence of the Court: \"Sir, you are incorrigible! The truth is not to  be got from you, for it is not in you. I see the villain in your  face!\"--\"Faith, yer honour,\" replied the witness, with the utmost  simplicity of truth and honesty, \"my face must be moighty clane and  shinin' indade, if it can reflect like that.\" For once in his life the  great barrister was floored by a simple witness. He could not recover  from that repartee, and the case went against him.    When Curran heard that there was a likelihood of trouble for the part he  took in 1798, and that in all probability he would be deprived of the  rank of Q.C., he remarked: \"They may take away the _silk_, but they  leave the _stuff_ behind.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Bully\" Egan had a great muscular figure, as may be guessed from the  story of the duel with Curran. To his bulk he added a stentorian voice,  which he freely used in Nisi Prius practice to browbeat opposing counsel  and witnesses, and through which he acquired his _sobriquet_. On one  occasion his opponent was a dark-visaged barrister who had made out a  good case for his client. Egan, in the course of an eloquent address,  begged the jury not to be carried away by the \"dark oblivion of a  brow.\"--\"What do you mean by using such balderdash?\" said a friend. \"It  may be balderdash,\" replied Egan, \"but depend upon it, it will do very  well for that jury.\" On another occasion he concluded a vituperative  address by describing the defendant as \"a most naufrageous  ruffian.\"--\"What sort of a ruffian is that?\" whispered his junior. \"I  have no idea,\" responded Egan, \"but I think _it sounds well_.\"           *       *       *       *       *    H. D. Grady was a strong supporter, in the Irish Parliament, of the  Union of Great Britain and Ireland, although he represented a  constituency strongly opposed to it; and he did not conceal the fact  that the Government had made it worth his while to support them. \"What!\"  exclaimed one of his constituents who remonstrated with him; \"do you  mean to sell your country?\"--\"Thank God,\" cried this patriot, \"I have a  country to sell.\"    For his Court work this anti-Nationalist barrister had what he called  his \"jury-eye.\" When he wanted a jury to note a particular point he kept  winking his right eye at them. Entering the Court one day looking very  depressed, a sympathetic friend asked if he was quite well, adding, \"You  are not so lively as usual.\"--\"How can I be,\" replied Grady, \"my  jury-eye is out of order.\"    He was examining a foreign sailor at Cork Assizes. \"You are a Swede, I  believe?\"--\"No, I am not.\"--\"What are you then?\"--\"I am a Dane.\" Grady  turned to the jury, \"Gentlemen, you hear the equivocating scoundrel. _Go  down, sir!_\"    Judge Boyd who, according to O'Connell, was guilty of sipping his wine  through a peculiarly made tube from a metal inkstand, to which we have  already referred, one day presided at a trial where a witness was  charged with being intoxicated at the time he was speaking about. Mr.  Harry Grady laboured hard to show that the man had been sober. Judge  Boyd at once interposed and said: \"Come now, my good man, it is a very  important consideration; tell the Court truly, were you drunk or were  you sober upon that occasion?\"--\"Oh, quite sober, my Lord.\" Grady added,  with a significant look at the _inkstand_, \"As sober as a judge!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Bethell, a barrister at the time of the Union of Ireland and Great  Britain, like many of his brethren, published a pamphlet on that  much-vexed subject. Mr. Lysaght, meeting him, said: \"Bethell, you never  told me you had published a pamphlet on the Union. The one I saw  contained some of the best things I have ever seen in any of these  publications.\"--\"I am proud you think so,\" rejoined the other eagerly.  \"Pray what was the thing that pleased you so much?\"--\"Well,\" replied  Lysaght, \"as I passed a pastry-cook's shop this morning, I saw a girl  come out with three hot mince-pies wrapped up in one of your  productions!\"    \"Pleasant Ned Lysaght,\" as his familiar friends called him, meeting a  Dublin banker one day"]]]
