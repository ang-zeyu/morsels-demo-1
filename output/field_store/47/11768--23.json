Here it was that Major Nichols on a look-see from the railroad  detachments found them. He had been sent across by the French colonel  commanding Vologda force, under which this Kodish force had recently  been brought. He was the first American field officer that had come to  inspect this hard-battered outfit. And his report on their miserable  plight had no little influence in bringing them relief.    Shortly afterward \"K\" Company was relieved by \"E\" Company which had come  down from Archangel guard duty, and \"K\" Company went to reserve position  in Seletskoe and later marched across the trail to Obozerskaya, took  troop train to Archangel for a much needed and highly deserved two  weeks' change of scenery and rest, arriving one evening in November in  an early winter's snow storm at Smolny Quay where the \"M\" Company men  captured them and their luggage and carried them off to a big feed,  first one they had had in Russia. Lieut. Ballard's heroic machine gun  platoon a few days later was also relieved, by Lieut. O'Callaghan's  platoon. So ended the fall campaign on the famous Kodish front.        VII    PENETRATING TO UST PADENGA    Taking Of Shenkursk On Vaga--\"Horse Marines\"--Battling At Puia--Bad  Position For Troops--Retirement To Ust Padenga--Critical Situation--\"C\"  Company Stands Heavy Losses--Lieutenant Cuff And Men Killed In Hand To  Hand Fighting--Bolshevik Patrols--Cossack Forces Weak On Defense.    While the old first battalion was, as we have seen, fighting up to  Seltso on the Dvina River, numerous reports were coming in daily that a  strong force of the Bolsheviki were operating on the Vaga River. This  river is a tributary of the Dvina and empties into it at a village  called Ust Vaga, about thirty versts below Beresnik and on which is  located the second largest town or city in the province of Archangel.  This river was strategically of more value than the upper Dvina,  because, as a glance at the map will show, its possession threatened the  rear of both the Dvina and the Kodish columns. Accordingly, on the  fifteenth day of September, accompanied by a river gunboat, the  remaining handful of Company \"A\", comprising two platoons, under Capt.  Odjard and Lieut. Mead, went on board a so-called fast river steamer en  route to Shenkursk. On the seventeenth day of September this detachment  took possession of Shenkursk without firing a single shot, the  Bolsheviki having fled in disorder upon word of our arrival. The  citizens of this village turned out en masse to welcome us as their  deliverers, and the Slavo-British Allied Legion soon gained a  considerable number of new recruits.    Shenkursk is a village about one hundred and twenty-five versts up the  Vaga River from its junction with the Dvina River. It is by far one of  the most substantial and prosperous in the province of Archangel. It  differs very materially from all the surrounding country in that it is  located on good sandy soil on a high bluff overlooking the river and is  comparatively dry, even in wet weather. It is quite a summer resort  town, has a number of well constructed brick buildings, half a dozen or  more schools, a seminary, monastery, saw mill, and in many others  respects is far above the average Russian village.    Upon their arrival our troops were quartered in an old Cossack garrison,  reminiscent of the days of the Czar. We prepared to settle down very  comfortably for the winter. Our dream of rest and quiet was rudely  shattered, however, for two days later we were notified that the British  command for the Vaga River troops was on its way to Shenkursk, and that  we were to push further on down the river to stir up the enemy. Without  question we were quite willing to leave the enemy rest in peace as long  as he did not molest us, but such was not the fortune nor luck of war,  and therefore, on September 1st, the small detachment of American  troops, reinforced by some thirty or forty S. B. A. L. troops, went  steaming up the Vaga River on the good ship \"Tolstoy,\" a decrepit old  river steamer on which we had mounted a pom pom and converted it into a  \"battle cruiser.\" The troops immediately christened themselves the horse  \"marines\" and the name was quite an appropriate one as later events  proved.    About noon that day Capt. Odjard and Lieut. Mead with two platoons  arrived opposite a village named Gorka when suddenly without any warning  the enemy, concealed in the woods on both sides of the river, opened up  a heavy machine gun and rifle fire. Our fragile boat was no protection  from this fire. To attempt to run around and withdraw in the shallow  stream was next to impossible, so after a hasty consultation the  commander grasped the horns of the dilemma by running the boat as close  to the shore as possible, where the troops immediately swarmed overboard  in water up to their waists, quickly gained the protection of the shore  and spreading out in perfect skirmish order, poured a hot fire into the  enemy, who was soon on the run. This advance continued for some several  days until under the severe marching conditions, lack of food, clothing,  etc., a halt was made at Rovdinskaya, a village about ninety versts from  Shenkursk, and a few days later more reinforcements arrived under  Lieuts. McPhail and Saari.    A number of incidents on this advance clearly indicated that we were  operating in hostile and very dangerous country. Our only line of  communication with our headquarters was the single local telegraph line,  which was constantly being cut by the enemy. At one time a large force  of the enemy got in our rear and we were faced with the unpleasant  situation of having the enemy completely surrounding us. Capt. Odjard  determined upon a bold stroke. Figuring that by continuing the advance  and striking a quick blow at the enemy ahead of us, those in the rear  would anticipate the possibility of heavy reinforcements bringing up our  rear. On October 8th we engaged the enemy at the village of Puiya. We  inflicted heavy casualties upon him. He suffered no less than fifty  killed and several hundred wounded. As anticipated, the enemy in our  rear quickly withdrew and thus cleared the way for our retreat. We  retired to Rovdinskaya, which position we held for several weeks. The  situation was growing more desperate day by day. Our rations were at the  lowest ebb; cold weather had set in and the men were poorly and lightly  clad, in addition to which our tobacco ration had long since been  completely exhausted, which added much to the general dissatisfaction  and lowering of the morale of the troops.    With the approach of the Russian winter a new and dangerous problem  presented itself. At the outset of the expedition it had been planned  that the troops on the railroad front were to push well down the  railroad to or beyond Plesetskaya. The Vaga Column was to go as far as  Velsk and there establish a line of communication across to the railroad  front. Unfortunately, their well-laid plans fell through and perhaps  fortunately so. The forces of the railroad had been checked near Emtsa,  far above Plesetskaya. The other troops on the Dvina had by this time  retired to Toulgas and as a consequence the smallest force in the  expedition, the Vaga Column, was now in the most advanced position of  these three fronts, a very dangerous and poorly chosen military  position.

Rumors were constantly  coming in that the Bolo was occupying the villages all along this trail  in order to launch a big drive on Shenkursk as soon as winter set in. On  these frozen, packed trails, troops, artillery, etc., could be moved as  easily and readily as by rail.    In order then to withdraw our lines and to add greater safety to the  columns, it was finally decided to withdraw from Rovdinskaya to Ust  Padenga.    At one o'clock on the morning of October 18th, as we lay shivering and  shaking in the cold and dismal marshes, which we chose to call our front  line, orders came through for us to hold ourselves in readiness for a  quick and rapid retreat the following morning. All that night we had  Russian peasants, interpreters, etc., scouring the villages about us for  horses and carts to assist in our withdrawal. At 6:00 a. m. that morning  the withdrawal began. The god of war, had he witnessed this strange  sight that morning, must have recalled a similar sight a hundred years  and more prior to that, at Moscow, when the army of the great Napoleon  was scattered to the winds by the cavalry and infantry of the Russian  hordes. Three hundred and more of the ludicrous two-wheeled Russian  carts preceded us with the artillery, floundering, miring, and slipping  in the sticky, muddy roads.

Instead of holding in his hands the  'government of the nation,' he came to be but one of many to share this  power; those who had served as high priests being still in esteem among  their nation, and having lost their office not for any reason that could  be considered valid by the religious sense of the community, exerted a  large influence over the decisions of the assembly. In the New Testament  they are regarded as the rulers (Matt. 26:59; 27:41; Acts 4:5, 8; Luke  23:13, 35; John 7:26), and Josephus' testimony supports this view. The  functions of the Sanhedrin were religious and moral, and also political.  In the latter capacity they further exercized administrative as well as  judicial functions. As a religious tribunal, the Sanhedrin wielded a  potent influence over the whole of the Jewish world (Acts 9:2); but as a  court of justice, after the division of the country upon the death of  Herod, its jurisdiction was limited to Judea. Here, however, its power  was absolute even to the passing of sentence of death (Josephus, Ant.  xiv, 9:3, 4; Matt. 26:3; Acts 4:5; 6:12; 22:30), although it had no  authority to carry the sentence into execution except as approved and  ordered by the representative of the Roman government. The law by which  the Sanhedrin governed was naturally the Jewish, and in the execution of  it this tribunal had a police of its own, and made arrests at its  discretion (Matt 26:47).... While the general authority of the Sanhedrin  extended over the whole of Judea, the towns in the country had local  councils of their own (Matt. 5:22; 10:17; Mark 13:9; Josephus, B. J. ii,  14:1), for the administration of local affairs. These were constituted  of elders (Luke 7:3), at least seven in number, (Josephus, Ant. iv,  8:14; B. J. ii, 20:5), and in some of the largest towns as many as  twenty-three. What the relation of these to the central council in  Jerusalem was does not appear clearly.... Some sort of mutual  recognition existed among them; for whenever the judges of the local  court could not agree it seems that they were in the habit of referring  their cases to the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem. (Josephus, Ant. iv, 8:14;  Mishna, Sanh. 11:2).\"    2. Talmud.--\"The body of Jewish civil and religious law (and discussion  directly or remotely relating thereto) not comprized in the Pentateuch,  commonly including the _Mishna_ and the _Gemara_, but sometimes limited  to the latter; written in Aramaic. It exists in two great collections,  the _Palestinian Talmud_, or _Talmud of the Land of Israel_, or _Talmud  of the West_, or, more popularly, _Jerusalem Talmud_, embodying the  discussions on the Mishna of the Palestinian doctors from the 2d to the  middle of the 5th century; and the _Babylonian_, embodying those of the  Jewish doctors in Babylonia, from about 190 to the 7th century.\"--_New  Standard Dict._ The Mishna comprizes the earlier portions of the Talmud;  the Gemara is made up of later writings and is largely an exposition of  the Mishna. An edition of the Babylonian Talmud alone (issued at Vienna  in 1682) comprized twenty-four tomes. (Geikie.)    3. Rabbis.--The title Rabbi is equivalent to our distinctive  appellations Doctor, Master, or Teacher. By derivation it means Master  or my Master, thus connoting dignity and rank associated with politeness  of address. A definite explanation of the term is given by John (1:38),  and the same meaning attaches by implication to its use as recorded by  Matthew (23:8). It was applied as a title of respect to Jesus on several  occasions (Matt. 23:7, 8; 26:25, 49; Mark 9:5; 11:21; 14:45; John 1:38,  49; 3:2, 26; 4:31; 6:25; 9:2; 11:8). The title was of comparatively  recent usage in the time of Christ, as it appears to have first come  into general use during the reign of Herod the Great, though the earlier  teachers, of the class without the name of Rabbis, were generally  reverenced, and the title was carried back to them by later usage. Rab  was an inferior title and Rabban a superior one to Rabbi. Rabboni was  expressive of most profound respect, love and honor (see John 20:16). At  the time of our Lord's ministry the Rabbis were held in high esteem, and  rejoiced in the afflations of precedence and honor among men. They were  almost exclusively of the powerful Pharisaic party.    The following is from Geikie's _Life and Words of Christ_, vol. I, chap.  6: \"If the most important figures in the society of Christ's day were  the Pharisees, it was because they were the Rabbis or teachers of the  Law. As such they received superstitious honor, which was, indeed, the  great motive, with many, to court the title or join the party. The  Rabbis were classed with Moses, the patriarchs, and the prophets, and  claimed equal reverence. Jacob and Joseph were both said to have been  Rabbis. The Targum of Jonathan substitutes Rabbis, or Scribes, for the  word 'prophets' where it occurs. Josephus speaks of the prophets of  Saul's day as Rabbis. In the Jerusalem Targum all the patriarchs are  learned Rabbis.... They were to be dearer to Israel than father or  mother--because parents avail only in this world [as was then taught]  but the Rabbi forever. They were set above kings, for is it not written  'Through me kings reign'? Their entrance into a house brought a  blessing; to live or to eat with them was the highest good fortune....  The Rabbis went even further than this in exalting their order. The  Mishna declares that it is a greater crime to speak anything to their  discredit, than to speak against the words of the Law.... Yet in form,  the Law received boundless honor. Every saying of the Rabbis had to be  based on some words of it, which were, however, explained in their own  way. The spirit of the times, the wild fanaticism of the people, and  their own bias, tended alike to make them set value only on ceremonies  and worthless externalisms, to the utter neglect of the spirit of the  sacred writings. Still it was held that the Law needed no confirmation,  while the words of the Rabbis did. So far as the Roman authority under  which they lived left them free, the Jews willingly put all power in the  hands of the Rabbis. They or their nominees filled every office, from  the highest in the priesthood to the lowest in the community. They were  the casuists, the teachers, the priests, the judges, the magistrates,  and the physicians of the nation.... The central and dominant  characteristic of the teaching of the Rabbis was the certain advent of a  great national Deliverer--the Messiah or Anointed of God or in the Greek  translation of the title, the Christ. In no other nation than the Jews  has such a conception ever taken such root or shown such vitality.... It  was agreed among the Rabbis that His birthplace must be Bethlehem, and  that He must rise from the tribe of Judah.\"    Individual rabbis gathered disciples about them, and, inevitably,  rivalry became manifest. Rabbinical schools and academies were  established, each depending for its popularity on the greatness of some  rabbi. The most famous of these institutions in the time of Herod I.  were the school of Hillel and that of his rival Shammai. Later,  tradition invested these with the title \"the fathers of old.\" It appears  from the trifling matters over which the followers of these two  disagreed, that only by opposition could either maintain a  distinguishing status. Hillel is reputed as the grandfather of Gamaliel,  the rabbi and doctor of the law at whose feet Saul of Tarsus, afterward  Paul the apostle, received his early instruction (Acts 22:3). So far as  we have historic record of the views, principles or beliefs advocated by  the rival schools of Hillel and Shammai, it appears that the former  stood for a greater degree of liberality and tolerance, while the later  emphasized a strict and possibly narrow interpretation of the law and  its associated traditions. The dependence of the rabbinical schools on  the authority of tradition is illustrated by an incident of record to  the effect that even the prestige of the great Hillel did not insure him  against uproar when once he spoke without citing precedent; only when he  added that so had his masters Abtalion and Shemajah spoken did the  tumult subside.    4. Sadducean Denial of the Resurrection.--As set forth in the text, the  Sadducees formed an association numerically small as compared with the  more popular and influential Pharisees. In the Gospels the Pharisees are  of frequent mention, and very commonly in connection with the scribes,  while the Sadducees are less frequently named. In the Acts of the  Apostles, the Sadducees appear frequently as opponents of the Church.  This condition was doubtless due to the prominence given the  resurrection from the dead among the themes of the apostolic preaching,  the Twelve continually bearing testimony to the actual resurrection of  Christ. Sadducean doctrine denied the actuality and possibility of a  bodily resurrection, the contention resting mainly on the ground that  Moses, who was regarded as the supreme mortal lawgiver in Israel, and  the chief mouthpiece of Jehovah, had written nothing concerning life  after death. The following is taken from Smith's _Dictionary of the  Bible_, article \"Sadducees,\" as touching this matter: \"The denial of  man's resurrection after death followed in the conception of the  Sadducees as a logical conclusion from their denial that Moses had  revealed to the Israelites the Oral Law. For on a point so momentous as  a second life beyond the grave, no religious party among the Jews would  have deemed themselves bound to accept any doctrine as an article of  faith, unless it had been proclaimed by Moses, their great legislator;  and it is certain "]]]
