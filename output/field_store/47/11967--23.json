(#18)"],[1,"this bird, and the name  gives a better conception of its haunts than that of Field Sparrow,  since it is found in bush-grown fields. From a bush-top it sings its  clearly whistled, sweet, appealing song, varying the relation of notes  and trills, but never their musical quality. In a bush also it nests,  laying 3-5 white eggs, marked with reddish brown, in May.      SLATE-COLORED JUNCO    _Junco hyemalis hyemalis. Case 2, Fig. 43; Case 4, Fig. 41_              The plumage of the female is tinged with brownish,            but the prevailing tone is slate-gray, unlike that            of any of our other Sparrows. The white outer-tail            feathers are conspicuously flashed in flight. L.            6-1/4.              _Range._ Nests from northern New England and            northern New York to Canada and southward in the            mountains to Pennsylvania; winters in all the            Eastern States. The Carolina Junco (_J. h.            carolinensis_), a slightly larger race without a            brownish tinge, nests in the higher parts of the            Alleghanies from Maryland to northern Georgia,            descending to the adjacent lowlands in winter.              Washington, abundant W.V., Sept. 26-May 12.            Ossining, common W.V., Sept. 19-May 4. Cambridge,            rather common W.V., abundant T.V., Sept. 20-Nov.            25; Mch. 20-Apl. 20. N. Ohio, abundant W.V., Oct.            2-May 5. Glen Ellyn, W.V., abundant spring and            fall, Aug. 30-May 13, SE, Minn., common T.V., Mch.            4-; Sept. 20-Nov. 12.    Gray skies and a snow-covered earth are the Junco colors, and when he  flashes them along the hedgerows and wood borders we know that although  it is only late September, winter will soon be with us. From that time  until April the Junco is of our commonest birds. He visits our  food-shelf and roosts in our evergreens, becoming almost as domestic as  the Chipping Sparrow. The Junco's call-notes are a sharp _tsip_, a  contented _chew-chew-chew_, and a sharp kissing call. Its modest,  musical little trill we shall not hear until spring. The nest is built  on the ground, and the 4-5 white, speckled, or spotted, eggs are laid  late in May.      BACHMAN'S SPARROW    _Peucaea aestivalis bachmani_              With a general resemblance to a Field Sparrow but            bill black and larger, cheeks and underparts more            buffy, tail shorter, no evident wing bars.              _Range._ Southeastern United States from central            Georgia to Virginia and from northwestern Florida            to central Illinois; winters from North Carolina            to northern Florida.    Where 'scrub' oaks grow beneath the pines, or post, or white oaks form  open woods, there one may look for this rather retiring, sweet-voiced  Sparrow. If one can imagine a Hermit Thrush singing the Field Sparrow's  chant, he will have some conception of the rare quality of Bachman's  Sparrow's song. The nest is built on the ground, the white unmarked eggs  being laid early in May.    The Pine Woods Sparrow (_P. ae. aestivalis_), is a darker race, more  streaked above with black. It is resident in Florida (except the  northwestern part) and southern Georgia where it frequents pine forests  undergrown with scrub palmetto.      SONG SPARROW    _Melospiza melodia melodia. Case 2, Fig. 34; Case 4, Fig. 42_              Streaked below, with a conspicuous spot in the            center of the breast.              _Range._ Most of North America, the eastern form            west to the Rockies, nesting from Virginia and            Missouri to Canada and wintering from Illinois and            Massachusetts to the Gulf.              Washington, common P.R., abundant T.V., Mch. and            Oct. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, very            abundant S.R., Mch. 10-Nov. 1; locally common W.V.            N. Ohio, P.R., abundant in summer, common in            winter; Glen Ellyn, common S.R. Feb. 12-Nov. 2.            SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 16-Nov. 11.    If the so-called 'English' Sparrow is the European Sparrow, the Song  Sparrow is the American Sparrow. He is found in every State and from the  Valley of Mexico to Alaska. He is abundant, musical, and familiar and  probably better known than any other member of his family native to this  country. His is one of the first birds' songs to be heard in the spring,  and the last in the fall, and when in midsummer, the adults, while  molting, are silent, the rambling, formless song of the young may be  heard.    Usually the Song Sparrow is found near water and not far from bushes  into which he flies when alarmed. Then we hear his characteristic  call-note, an impatient _chimp_, _chimp_, unlike that of any other of  our Sparrows. The nest is built on the ground and the 4-5 bluish white  brown-marked eggs are laid late in April.      LINCOLN'S SPARROW    _Melospiza lincolni lincolni. Case 7, Fig. 15_              A broad band of buff across the streaked breast.              _Range._ Chiefly western United States; in the            East, nests from northern New York and northern            Minnesota into Canada; winters from Mississippi to            Central America; rare east of the Alleghanies.              Washington, rare T.V., May 8-21; Sept. 30-Oct. 1.            Ossining, rare T.V., Sept. 29-Oct. 16. Cambridge,            not uncommon T.V., May 15-May 25; Sept. 14-Oct.            10. N. Ohio, tolerably common T.V., Apl. 25-May            25. Glen Ellyn, not common T.V., fall records            only, Sept. 11-Oct. 9. SE. Minn., common T.V.,            Apl. 17-; Sept. 10-Oct. 30.    We know the species only as a rare, retiring migrant, frequenting  hedgerows, and undergrowth. I have never heard its song while migrating.      SWAMP SPARROW    _Melospiza georgiana. Case 4, Fig. 44; Case 5, Fig. 22_              Note the bright chestnut cap, grayish, unstreaked            breast, and reddish brown rump of the summer            plumage; in winter, the crown is darker and            streaked with black. L. 5-1/4.              _Range._ Nests from New Jersey and Illinois to            Canada; winters from Nebraska and New Jersey to            the Gulf.              Washington, very common T.V., Apl. 12-May 19;            Sept, 28-Oct. 29; a few winter. Ossining,            tolerably common S.R., Apl. 4-Dec. 2; a few            winter. Cambridge, abundant S.R., Apl. 12-Nov. 10;            a few winter. N. Ohio, common T.V., Mch. 23-May            20. Glen Ellyn, tolerably common T.V., Apl. 2-May            26; Sept. 2-Oct. 24; possibly S.R. SE. Minn.,            common S.R., Apl. 5-Nov. 18.    The Swamp Sparrow is a Sparrow of the marshes whose _tweet-tweet-tweet_  many times repeated, is associated with the music of Marsh Wrens. It  nests on the ground in May, laying eggs not unlike those of the Song  Sparrow.      FOX SPARROW    _Passerella iliaca iliaca. Case 4, Fig. 37; Case 5, Fig. 7_              A large, bright, reddish brown Sparrow, which,            because of its red-brown tail, and in spite of its            stout bill, is sometimes mistaken for the Hermit            Thrush. L. 7-1/2.              _Range._ Nests in northern Canada; winters from            Ohio and Maryland to the Gulf States.              Washington, very abundant T.V., Mch. 13-May 11;            Oct. 23-Nov. 15: a few winter. Ossining, tolerably            common T.V., Mch. 4-Apl. 20; Oct. 14-Nov. 28.            Cambridge, abundant T.V., Mch. 15-Apl. 12; Oct.            20-Nov. 15; occasional in winter. N. Ohio, common            T.V., Mch. 12-Apl. 23; Oct. 1-Nov. 16. Glen Ellyn,            fairly common T.V., Mch. 11-Apl. 28; Sept. 22-Nov.            8. SE. Minn., common T.V., Mch. 12-; Sept. 17-Nov.            12.    A vigorous scratcher in the undergrowth who, using both feet at once,  kicks the leaves out behind him; a master musician among our Sparrows  whose loud, clear, joyous notes form one of our most notable bird songs.  We hear it only for a brief time in spring and fall as the birds pass us  on their migration.      TOWHEE    _Pipilo erythrophthalmus erythrophthalmus. Case 4, Figs. 32, 33; Case 6.  Fig. 51_              The female is brown where the male is black; both            are unmistakable L. 8-1/4.              _Range._ Nests from northern Georgia and central            Kansas; winters from Ohio and Potomac Valleys to            the Gulf.              Washington, common S.R., very common T.V., Apl.            5-Oct. 21; a few winter. Ossining, common S.R.,            Apl. 21-Oct. 31. Cambridge, common S.R., Apl.            25-Oct. 15. N. Ohio, common S.R., Mch. 10-Oct. 25.            Glen Ellyn, not common, S.R., Mch. 30-Nov. 18, SE.            Minn., common S.R., Apl. 11-Nov. 8.    _Chewi['n]k, towhee_, the clear, emphatic, strongly accented call  announces the presence of a bird whose colors are as distinctive as its  notes. The Towhee feeds on the ground in and near bushy places, but when  the desire to sing comes upon him he leaves his lowly haunts and taking  a more or less exposed perch, fifteen to twenty feet from the ground,  utters his _sweet-bird-sin-n-n-g_, with an earnestness which goes far to  atone for his lack of striking musical ability. The nest is built on the  ground and the 4-5 white, finely speckled eggs are laid during the first  half of May.    The White-eyed Towhee (_P. e. alleni_) of Florida and the coast region  north to Charleston, South Carolina, has the eye yellowish instead of  red and the white markings are more restricted. Its call is higher than  that of the northern bird and its song shorter.      CARDINAL    _Cardinalis cardinalis cardinalis. Case 4, Figs. 34, 35._              The male, with his conspicuous crest and bright            colors, can be confused with no other species; the            female is much duller and the crest is less            prominent but still evident.

On one occasion the child (who is just as  fond of him as he is of her) was very ill, and for three weeks was  unconscious. As soon as this was the case, the dog ceased to go near  the nursery, as if by instinct he knew he would not be noticed. Mr.  Walters from Reading was attending the baby, and the dog soon got to  know the time he paid his visits. He would watch him upstairs, and when  he came down listen most attentively to his report. At length the child  was pronounced out of danger. The very next morning, up went master Sam,  made his way straight to the child's cot, and stood on his hind legs to  be caressed. Although she had taken no notice of any one for some time,  she seemed to know the dog, and tried to move her hand towards him to be  licked. He quite understood the action, licked the little hand lovingly,  and then trotted contentedly away. After this he went up to see her  regularly, as he had been accustomed to do. He is quite a character in  the town, and nearly every one knows Sammy Weller.    Before I had this dog, I always thought I understood the difference  between reason and instinct, but his intelligence has quite puzzled me.              MARY H. BARFORD.      ARE DOGS \"COLOUR-BLIND\"?              [_Jan. 12, 1884._]    Your correspondent, \"W. H. O'Shea,\" has found several dogs  \"colour-blind,\" If black is a colour, I can give several instances in  which a black retriever dog of mine was certainly _not_ \"colour-blind.\"  He had the greatest antipathy to sweeps and coalheavers, and would fly  at them if not fastened up or carefully watched. He would even bark at a  passing hearse! In all other respects, he was the best-tempered dog in  the world, and I can only imagine that when very young he must have been  ill-used by either a sweep or a coalheaver.              C. R. T.      LUCKY AND UNLUCKY.              [_April 28, 1877._]    As letters telling of dogs and their doings occasionally appear in the  _Spectator_, perhaps the following rather pathetic anecdote of a dog I  know well may also find a place there. Two or three weeks ago, Lucky--so  called from having, when an outcast, found its present happy  home--perhaps by way of showing its gratitude to its benefactors,  presented them with five small Luckys, or rather, with one exception,  Unluckys, as the melancholy process always resorted to with these  too-blooming families had to be carried out in this instance, and the  five were reduced to one. Poor Lucky was inconsolable, looking  everywhere for them, and looking, too, with such appealing eyes into the  faces of her friends, and asking them so plainly where they were. Near  her kennel was an inclosed piece of ground for pigeons, and as it was  discovered that rats were carrying off the young pigeons, and as Lucky  had carried off one or two rats, it was decided one night to leave the  door of the pigeons' house open, that Lucky might have the run of it;  and the next morning, side by side with the puppy, was found a baby  pigeon, looking quite bright and at home, but hungry, and poor Lucky,  proud of the addition it had made to its family, was looking more  contented than it had done since the loss of its puppies. The pigeon  must have fallen from its nest, some distance from the ground, and  Lucky, while on the look-out for rats, must have found it, and carefully  carried it to her kennel, with the vague feeling, perhaps, that it was  one of her own lost little ones \"developing\" a little curiously.  Unfortunately the arrangement could not be a permanent one, and the  famished little pigeon was put back into its own nest, to be found again  the next morning in Lucky's bed, but this time dead. The old birds seem  to have deserted it, and it had died of starvation. If Lucky could give  this account herself, it might be much more interesting, for it was  thought not at all improbable that she had actually rescued from a rat  the bird she was so anxious to adopt, as a small wound was found upon  it such as a rat might have made, and as a young pigeon had been taken  the night before from the same nest; but this is only conjecture, and  Lucky only could tell us the facts; how often it would be interesting,  if our humble friends could tell us their adventures! A friend who is  staying with me tells me that a few months ago her dog was lost for a  week, and at the end of that time it came back one night in a scarlet  ruff and spangles, and looking altogether dreadfully dissipated.  Evidently it had been the \"performing dog\" in some show, \"Punch and  Judy\" perhaps; being naturally a clever dog, it would quickly have  learnt the part of \"Toby\" in that delightful and time-honoured  exhibition. If it could only have written also an article entitled \"A  Week of My Life,\" with what pleasure the _Spectator_ would have  published it!              S.      THE COURAGE OF ANIMALS.              [_Feb. 11, 1893._]    In the _Spectator_ of December 31st, which, although a regular  subscriber to your valuable paper, I only happened to see to-day, owing  to absence from home, I notice a reference in the article entitled \"The  Courage of Animals,\" to the fact that the wild dogs of India attack and  destroy tigers. I have no personal knowledge of the matter, but I have  been told by an Indian officer that the _modus operandi_ of the \"red  dogs\" is as follows:--Having found their tiger they proceed, not to  attack him at once, as might be inferred from your article, but to  starve him until they have materially reduced his strength. Night and  day they form a cordon round the unfortunate beast, and allow him no  chance of obtaining food or rest; every time the tiger essays to break  the circle, this is widened as the pack flies before him, only to be  relentlessly narrowed again when the quarry is exhausted. After a  certain period of this treatment the tiger falls a comparatively easy  prey to his active and persevering enemies. This theory of their plan of  attack, while it may detract somewhat from the wild dogs' reputation for  courage, must add considerably to our estimate of their intelligence.              EDWARD PAUL, Jun.      SOME FACTS OF MATERNAL INSTINCT IN ANIMALS.              [_Oct. 1, 1892._]    I lately met some friends who had with them a little dog, called Vic,  who had adopted the family of a cat in the house, and, while in  possession, would not let the mother come near her kittens. The kittens  were kept in a very tall basket, and Vic would take them in her mouth,  and jump out with them one by one, and then carry them into the garden  and watch over them, carrying them back in the same way after a time; at  other times, lying contentedly with them in the basket. Of course Vic  had to be forcibly removed when the adopted family required their  mother's attention for their sustenance. I also have met a friend who  saw a hen-hawk, who was in a cage, mothering a young starling. Three  young, unfledged starlings were given the hawk to eat. She ate two, and  then broodled the other, and took the utmost care of it. Unhappily, the  young starling died; and from that moment the hawk would touch no food,  but died herself in a few days.    The same friend was on a mountain one day, when a sheep came up to him,  and unmistakably begged him to follow her going just in front, and  continually looking round to see if he was following. The sheep led him  at last to some rocks, where he found a lamb fast wedged in between two  pieces of rock. He was able to liberate the lamb, to the evident joy of  the mother.    I myself once saw a cat \"broodling\" and taking care of a very small  chicken, which, being hatched first of a brood, had been brought into a  cottage and placed in a basket near the fire. It managed to get out of  the basket, and hopped up to the cat, who immediately adopted it.              WM. WALSHAM WAKEFIELD.      HAVE ANIMALS A FOREKNOWLEDGE OF DEATH?              [_April 30, 1892._]    In a recent _Spectator_ there is a quotation from Pierre Loti to the  effect that \"animals not only fear death, but fear it the more because  they are aware that they have no future.\" Pierre Loti is a brilliant  novelist, but I am not aware that he is a scientific naturalist, and I  trust his idea is a mere chimera. Loti would take from the brutes the  one privilege for which men may envy them, and endows them with a  knowledge of the aftertime that we have only by revelation. However, two  common-sense naturalists have published their belief that the lower  animals have a foreknowledge of death, and one of them goes so far as to  give an account of an old horse committing suicide. He says the animal  frequently suffered from some internal disease, and that it deliberately  walked into a pond, and, putting its nostrils under water, stood thus  till it dropped dead from suffocation. The incident, I think, is easily  explained. Many horses drink in the manner described, and in old horses  heart-disease is not uncommon. I imagine the stoppage of respiration  caused a sudden and natural death from heart-disease.    I should like to ask naturalists who think animals know that they must  die, where they draw the line. They must stop somewhere between a dog  and a dormouse. Poets have made far more frequent allusion to the  subject than naturalists, and they may be quoted on both sides. Philip  James Bailey, in illustration of his contention that hope is universal,  says: \"and the poor hack that sinks down on the flints, upon whose eye  the dust is settling, he hopes to die.\" But we have on the other hand  Shelley's Skylark, with its \"ignorance of pain,\" because it differs from  men who \"look before and after.\" Wordsworth's little girl of eight knew  less than her dog, if she had one, for, says the poet, \"what could she  know of death?\" I admit that when the carnivora have crushed their prey  to death they cease to mangle them; but I fancy that is"]]]
