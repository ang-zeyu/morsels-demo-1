It is the most valuable, especially for the production of fine  yarns.    The most regular cotton is Orleans, in which the length of the staple  varies only a small fraction of an inch. In consequence of this there  is less loss in working Orleans than is the case with the other  cottons, owing to the fact that their fibers vary in length.    =The Leading Growths of Cotton.= In order to purchase the raw material  of the cotton manufacture, to arrange the \"mixing\" or have much to do  with the raw material in any other capacity, one should know as much  as possible of its characteristics; for ignorance may cause much  trouble and no little loss to those who have to spin the cotton. Each  crop differs from the previous one to a greater or less degree, as it  depends entirely upon the weather. Thus, in a very dry season there is  a \"droughty crop\" which, while it may be (and generally is) clean and  well up in class, will be weak, short, and of irregular fiber. In  order to obtain the desired length and strength of staple the buyer  will have to pay a relatively higher price than in what may be termed  a normal season.    [Illustration: FANCY COTTON LOOM]    Again, in a crop that is poor in class, a defect that may have been  caused by too much rain in the early or middle stages of its growth,  or by unfavorable weather for the production of cotton of good grade,  the staple will probably be all that could be desired, leafy and  small, but the buyer will have to pay more to obtain his usual grade,  especially if he requires it for good filling. Then there are seasons  when the crop turns out fairly well in class and staple, but the  cotton is wasty, dirty, or abnormally leafy; and in this case the  buyer has to exercise great care and judgment in calculating the extra  loss that will ensue.    The terms of purchase of cotton include an allowance of 4 per cent for  tares. That is, a bale of cotton weighing 400 pounds would be paid for  as 384 pounds, or should the buyer have reason to believe that the  tares are unusually heavy, he has the option of claiming the actual  tare. This is ascertained by stripping ten bales and weighing the  covering and the hoops, which means considerable work, and although it  is at the option of the buyer, it is an exception rather than the  rule.    As a result of these causes we find cotton divided into the following  grades:    =Full Grades of Cotton.= Egyptian cotton is graded as follows: extra  fine, fine, good, fully good fair, good fair, fair, middling fair,  middling.    Indian cotton is graded as follows: superfine, fine, fully good, good,  fully good fair, good fair, fully fair.    Brazilian cotton may be classed: fine, good, good fair, fair, middling  fair, middling.    American cotton has seven grades: fair, middling fair, good middling,  middling, low middling, good ordinary, and ordinary.    In addition to the full grades there are half and quarter grades. The  American cottons are graded as follows:     _Full Grades._       _Half Grades._            _Quarter Grades._     Fair,                Strict middling fair,     Barely fair,   Middling fair,       Strict good middling,     Fully middling fair,   Good middling,       Strict middling,          Barely middling fair,   Middling,            Strict low middling,      Fully good middling,   Low middling,        Strict good ordinary,     Barely good middling,   Good ordinary,       Strict ordinary.          Fully middling,   Ordinary.                                      Barely middling,                                                  Fully low middling,                                                  Barely low middling,                                                  Fully good ordinary,                                                  Barely good ordinary.    The following are a few of the leading varieties of cotton, with the  numbers of yarn they will make:     _Cotton._                   _Length._         _Warp._       _Filling._     Sea Island (selected)       1-3/4  to 2-1/4   up to 200     250 to 300   Sea Island (ordinary)       1-3/4  to 2             150         220   Florida Sea Island          1-3/4  to 2             150         220   Georgia                     1-1/2  to 1-7/8         120         180   Egyptian                    1-1/4  to 1-1/2          70         120   Peeler                      1-1/4  to 1-3/8          50          70   Orleans or Gulf             1-1/16 to 1-1/4          40          60   Upland                      1      to 1-1/8          30          45   Texas                         7/8  to 1-1/16         25          35    During the last few years considerable discussion has taken place  among mill men, both in this country and abroad, bearing upon the  subject of moisture contained in baled cotton. Of course the natural  moisture in the cotton fiber varies, as might be expected, from year  to year, according to the character of the season during the picking.  The standard of moisture is based upon what is known as regain, that  is, if 100 parts of absolutely dry cotton are exposed to the air, they  will absorb about 8-1/2 per cent of moisture, although a much higher  per cent is sometimes found.    In some of the small Southern mills located in the cotton raising  section, the cotton is delivered by team direct from the gin, without  going through the compress. In this way they save the greater part of  transportation expense. They also save in the strength of the cotton  fiber itself, since the process of compression injures the fiber. They  get better cotton, being nearer the source of supply and having better  opportunities for selection.    When the cotton arrives in the shape of a bale, it is necessary to cut  ties and loosen up the cotton before use. This may be done in two  ways. One method being to pull the bale apart by hand, and the other  to pass it through a bale breaker or similar machine, which loosens up  the cotton by means of beaters. It now starts on a continuous journey  through successive machines until it is made into yarn. The yarn is  made into a warp, and the warp interlaced with the filling yarn to  make cloth, and the cloth finished for the market.    Not every country is adapted for making cotton yarn, for certain  conditions are necessary to manufacture good yarn. If the atmosphere  is too warm or too dry, the fibers will become brittle and will not  twist well; if too wet they collapse and stick. Lancashire County,  England, seems to have been fitted by nature for cotton spinning. It  has just the right climate, a moist temperature, and copious water  supply. There are hills on the east of the valley, forming a water  shed, and the town lies in a basin covered with a bed of stiff clay,  that holds the water, allowing it to evaporate just fast enough to  keep the air in the moist condition needed to fit the fibers for  weaving. Countries that have not these conditions are obliged to  produce them by artificial means--humidifying, etc.    [Illustration: PICKER ROOM      1.

Lap of Cotton.]    =Picker Room.= The first step in the conversion of the bale of cotton  into yarn consists in giving the cotton fibers a thorough cleaning.  This is accomplished by feeding the cotton to a series of picker  machines called in order, bale breaker, cotton opener and automatic  feeder, breaker picker, intermediate picker, and finisher picker.  These machines pull to shreds the matted locks and wads of cotton (as  we find them in the bale), beat out the dirt, stones, and seeds, and  finally leave the cotton in the form of batting upon the cylinders;  this batting passes from one machine to another until it issues from  the finisher picker as a downy roll or lap.    (Sometimes the bale breaker is not used in the mill.)    [Illustration: CARD ROOM      1. Roving Can--receptacle to hold the sliver. After it is filled it       is transferred to either ribbon lap machine or drawing frame.    2. Cylinder of the card. The cotton is on this cylinder in the form       of a web.]    =Carding Machine.= When the lap of cotton leaves the picker it goes to  the carding machine, where it is combed into parallel fibers by means  of a revolving cylinder covered with wire teeth called card clothing.  As the cotton is fed to the card in the form of a sheet or lap from  the picker, it is supposed to have been freed from a considerable  quantity of sand, seed, etc., but there still remain nep, fine leaf,  and short fibers, which are removed during carding.    On leaving the card cylinder the lap has become a gossamer-like web  thirty-nine inches broad. This web next passes through small \"eyes,\"  which condense it into a narrow band about an inch in width, known as  card sliver.    When a lap is delivered from the finisher picker, it should weigh a  given number of ounces per yard. The method of ascertaining the weight  is to make each lap a standard number of yards in length and weigh  each lap. The machine can be regulated so as to give the desired  weight per yard.    =Combing.= When an extremely fine and strong yarn is required, in  addition to carding, the fibers are also subjected to the process of  \"combing.\" This may be said to be merely a continuation of the carding  process to a more perfect degree. The chief object is to extract all  fibers below a certain required length, and cast them aside as  \"waste.\" This is done in order to secure the very best fibers  calculated to give the strongest and best results in the spun yarn.    The process of combing follows carding. The card delivers the cotton  in the form of a sliver or strand, while the combing machine"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24107"],[0,"The New World of Islam (#18)"],[1,"and laboured to diffuse all the benefits of Western  civilization. They honestly believed that the extension of Western  political control was the best and quickest, perhaps the only, means of  modernizing the backward portions of the world.    That standpoint is ably presented by a British \"liberal imperialist,\"  Professor Ramsay Muir, who writes: \"It is an undeniable fact that the  imperialism of the European peoples has been the means whereby European  civilization has been in some degree extended to the whole world, so  that to-day the whole world has become a single economic unit, and all  its members are parts of a single political system. And this achievement  brings us in sight of the creation of a world-order such as the wildest  dreamers of the past could never have anticipated. Without the  imperialism of the European peoples North and South America, Australia,  South Africa, must have remained wildernesses, peopled by scattered  bands of savages. Without it India and other lands of ancient  civilization must have remained, for all we can see, externally subject  to that endless succession of wars and arbitrary despotisms which have  formed the substance of their history through untold centuries, and  under which neither rational and equal law nor political liberty, as we  conceive them, were practicable conceptions. Without it the backward  peoples of the earth must have continued to stagnate under the dominance  of an unchanging primitive customary regime, which has been their state  throughout recorded time. If to-day the most fruitful political ideas of  the West--the ideas of nationality and self-government--which are purely  products of Western civilization, are beginning to produce a healthy  fermentation in many parts of the non-European world, that result is due  to European Imperialism.\"[83]    The ethics of modern imperialism have nowhere been better formulated  than in an essay by Lord Cromer. \"An imperial policy,\" he writes, \"must,  of course, be carried out with reasonable prudence, and the principles  of government which guide our relations with whatsoever races are  brought under our control must be politically and economically sound and  morally defensible. This is, in fact, the keystone of the imperial arch.  The main justification of imperialism is to be found in the use which is  made of imperial power. If we make good use of our power, we may face  the future without fear that we shall be overtaken by the Nemesis which  attended Roman misrule. If the reverse is the case, the British Empire  will deserve to fall, and of a surety it will ultimately fall.\"[84]    Such are the basic sanctions of Western imperialism as evolved during  the nineteenth century. Whether or not it is destined to endure, there  can be no question that this prodigious extension of European political  control greatly favoured the spread of Western influences of every kind.  It is, of course, arguable that the East would have voluntarily adopted  Western methods and ideas even if no sort of Western pressure had been  applied. But they would have been adopted much more slowly, and this  vital element of time renders such arguments mere academic speculation.  For the vital, expanding nineteenth-century West to have deliberately  restrained itself while the backward East blunderingly experimented with  Westernism, accepting and rejecting, buying goods and refusing to pay  for them, negotiating loans and then squandering and repudiating them,  inviting in Europeans and then expelling or massacring them, would have  been against all history and human nature.    As a matter of fact, Western pressure was applied, as it was bound to be  applied; and this constant, ubiquitous, unrelenting pressure, broke down  the barriers of Oriental conservatism and inertia as nothing else could  have done, forced the East out of its old ruts, and compelled it to take  stock of things as they are in a world of hard facts instead of  reminiscent dreams. In subsequent chapters we shall examine the manifold  results of this process which has so profoundly transformed the Orient  during the past hundred years. Here we will continue our general survey  by examining the more recent aspects of Western control over the East  and the reactions of the East thereto.    In my opinion, the chief fallacy involved in criticisms of Western  control over Eastern lands arises from failure to discriminate between  nineteenth-century and twentieth-century imperialism. Nineteenth-century  imperialism was certainly inevitable, and was apparently beneficial in  the main. Twentieth-century imperialism cannot be so favourably judged.  By the year 1900 the Oriental peoples were no longer mere fanatical  obscurantists neither knowing nor caring to know anything outside the  closed circle of their ossified, decadent civilizations. The East had  been going to school, and wanted to begin to apply what it had been  taught by the West. It should have been obvious that these peoples,  whose past history proved them capable of achievement and who were now  showing an apparently genuine desire for new progress, needed to be  treated differently from what they had been. In other words, a more  liberal attitude on the part of the West had become advisable.    But no such change was made. On the contrary, in the West itself, the  liberal idealism which had prevailed during most of the nineteenth  century was giving way to that spirit of fierce political and economic  rivalry which culminated in the Great War.[85] Never had Europe been so  avid for colonies, for \"spheres of influence,\" for concessions and  preferential markets; in fine, so \"imperialistic,\" in the unfavourable  sense of the term. The result was that with the beginning of the  twentieth century Western pressure on the East, instead of being  relaxed, was redoubled; and the awakening Orient, far from being met  with sympathetic consideration, was treated more ruthlessly than it had  been for two hundred years. The way in which Eastern countries like  Turkey and Persia, striving to reform themselves and protect their  independence, were treated by Europe's new _Realpolitik_ would have  scandalized the liberal imperialists of a generation before. It  certainly scandalized present-day liberals, as witness these scathing  lines written in 1912 by the well-known British publicist Sidney Low:    \"The conduct of the Most Christian Powers during the past few years has  borne a striking resemblance to that of robber-bands descending upon an  unarmed and helpless population of peasants. So far from respecting the  rights of other nations, they have exhibited the most complete and  cynical disregard for them. They have, in fact, asserted the claim of  the strong to prey upon the weak, and the utter impotence of all ethical  considerations in the face of armed force, with a crude nakedness which  few Eastern military conquerors could well have surpassed.    \"The great cosmic event in the history of the last quarter of a century  has been the awakening of Asia after centuries of somnolence. The East  has suddenly sprung to life, and endeavoured to throw itself vigorously  into the full current of Western progress. Japan started the enterprise;  and, fortunately for herself, she entered upon it before the new Western  policy had fully developed itself, and while certain archaic ideals  about the rights of peoples and the sanctity of treaties still  prevailed. When the new era was inaugurated by the great Japanese  statesmen of the nineteenth century, Europe did not feel called upon to  interfere. We regarded the Japanese renaissance with interest and  admiration, and left the people of Nippon to work out the difficulties  of their own salvation, unobstructed. If that revolution had taken place  thirty years later, there would probably have been a different story to  tell; and New Japan, in the throes of her travail, would have found the  armed Great Powers at her bedside, each stretching forth a mailed fist  to grab something worth taking. Other Eastern countries which have  endeavoured to follow the example of Japan during the present century  have had worse luck. During the past ten years a wave of sheer  materialism and absolute contempt for international morality has swept  across the Foreign Offices of Europe, and has reacted disastrously upon  the various Eastern nations in their desperate struggles to reform a  constitutional system. They have been attempting to carry out the  suggestions made to them for generations by benevolent advisers in  Christendom.    \"Now, when they take these counsels to heart, and endeavour, with  halting steps, and in the face of immense obstacles, to pursue the path  of reform, one might suppose that their efforts would be regarded with  sympathetic attention by the Governments of the West; and that, even if  these offered no direct aid, they would at least allow a fair trial.\"  But, on the contrary, \"one Great Power after another has used the  opportunity presented by the internal difficulties of the Eastern  countries to set out upon a career of annexation.\"[86]    We have already seen how rapid was this career of annexation,  extinguishing the independence of the last remaining Mohammedan states  at the close of the Great War. We have also seen how it exacerbated  Moslem fear and hatred of the West. And the West was already feared and  hated for many reasons. In the preceding chapter we traced the growth of  the Pan-Islamic movement, and in subsequent chapters we shall trace the  development of Oriental nationalism. These politico-religious movements,  however, by no means exhaust the list of Oriental reactions to  Westernism. There are others, economic, social, racial in character. In  view of the complex nature of the Orient's reaction against Westernism,  let us briefly analyse the problem in its various constituent elements.    Anti-Western feeling has been waning in"]]]
