Pencils,  india-rubbers, pens, and rulers were fastened to all parts of her  dress; and a College cap, borrowed from Miss Maitland, completed the  effect.    The funniest of all, however, was Madge Summers, who represented a  sausage. She had been elaborately got up for the part by her  room-mates. They borrowed a coloured table-cloth from the kitchen, the  reverse side of which was a pinky-fawn shade; then they padded Madge  carefully all over, so as to make her the right shape, swathed her in  the table-cloth, and fastened it down the back with safety-pins, tying  it tightly round her neck and ankles. She could scarcely manage to  walk, much less dance; and she was so hot in her many wrappings that  her face burnt--so she assured her friends--as if she were already on  the frying-pan: but if she could not take an active part in the  proceedings, she had the satisfaction of attracting an immense amount  of attention.    The girls chose partners in the hall, and marched in procession into  the recreation room, where Miss Maitland (a stately Marie Antoinette)  acted hostess, and received her guests with the assistance of Miss  Parkinson (a Spanish gipsy) and Vivian Holmes (hastily attired as a  troubadour).    \"It is indeed a carnival,\" said Miss Maitland. \"The costumes are  splendid, and all deserve hearty congratulations. We shall have to take  votes as to which is the best. We haven't thought of the music yet; it  seems almost presumptuous to ask Queen Cleopatra to play a waltz for  us, but perhaps she will condescend thus far. We can't ask the sausage,  for she hasn't any arms! The troubadour and the Pied Piper ought to do  their share, and the Merry-andrew must give us a _pas seul_.\"    Everybody declared the evening to be the greatest success. The  lemonade, fortunately cold, was delicious, and so were the biscuits  that Miss Maitland, through lack of any other dainties, had provided as  refreshments. Half-past nine came far too soon, and the dancers, hot,  flushed, and excited, were forced reluctantly to abandon the  festivities and betake themselves upstairs to tear off their grandeur.    Honor slept between the blankets that night, and her slumbers were  haunted by a vision of Miss Maitland, as an avenging spectre, arrayed  in the mutilated sheets. The dream was certainly prophetic, for the  house-mistress was extremely angry on discovering the damage done, and  gave Honor a lecture such as she richly deserved.    \"You will stay in from cricket to-day, and mend the sheets,\" she  decreed, at the conclusion of the scolding. \"You will find them ready  fixed by two o'clock. I shall expect the seams to be neatly run, and  the edges turned over and hemmed.\"    Honor groaned. After the excitement of yesterday's match, she had been  looking forward to the cricket practice; moreover, she hated sewing.  But there was no appeal. Each house-mistress had authority to suspend  games, if necessary, so she was compelled to pass a weary afternoon at  a most uncongenial occupation.    \"It's hard labour!\" she exclaimed, when Janie ran in at four o'clock.  \"Finished! No! I've only run one seam, and hemmed about six inches. I  feel like the 'Song of the shirt' (only it's the song of the sheet  instead). 'Stitch, stitch, stitch', and 'work, work, work'! My fingers  are getting quite 'weary and worn'. There's one comfort, at any rate:  Miss Maitland won't be likely to keep me away from preparation, and as  the clothes go to the wash to-morrow, perhaps she'll let one of the  maids do the rest of this, and give me some other penance instead. I'd  rather learn five chapters of history, or a scene from Shakespeare; and  I'd welcome a whole page of equations--I would indeed!\"    \"I'm afraid it's a vain hope,\" said Janie. \"Miss Maitland always sticks  to her word.\"    She proved right; Miss Maitland was inexorable. The discipline at  Chessington was strict, and any mistress who gave an order was  accustomed to enforce it rigorously. Honor was obliged to forgo the  triumphs of the playing-fields until the very last stitch had been put  in her sheets--a punishment which was severe enough, if not entirely to  work a reform, at any rate to sober her considerably for the present.          CHAPTER VIII    A Mysterious Happening      \"I wonder how it is,\" philosophized Ruth Latimer, \"that one always  seems to like some girls so much, and detest others? There are certain  people who, no matter what they do, or even if their intentions are  good, always rub one up the wrong way.\"    \"Natural affinity, or the reverse, I suppose,\" answered Maisie Talbot.  \"I'm a great believer in first impressions. I can generally tell in  five minutes whether I'm going to be friends with anyone or not; and I  find I'm nearly certain to be right in the long run.\"    \"I suppose I must have a natural antipathy, then, against Flossie  Taylor,\" confessed Honor candidly. \"It didn't take me as long as five  minutes to discover my sentiments towards her.\"    \"I don't wonder,\" said Lettice. \"Flossie is a bounder!\"    \"What's that?\"    \"Oh, Paddy! You've lived at the back of beyond! A bounder  means--well--just a bounder; putting on side, you know.\"    \"How particularly lucid and enlightening!\"    \"It means someone who tries to make herself out of more consequence  than she really is,\" explained Maisie. \"Flossie is continually dragging  into her conversation the grand things she has at home, and the grand  people she stays with.\"    \"She doesn't mention them naturally, as anyone might do without being  offensive,\" said Ruth Latimer. \"She parades them just to show off, in a  particularly obtrusive and objectionable manner.\"    \"And we think that very bad taste at Chessington, because, of course,  almost all of us have quite as nice homes and friends, only we don't  care to boast about them.\"    \"It looks as if you hadn't been accustomed to decent things, if you're  always wanting to let people know you possess them,\" added Lettice.    \"The worst of it is,\" continued Maisie, \"that she's having a bad  influence at St. Chad's. The Hammond-Smiths and the Lawsons and the  Palmers follow her lead implicitly, and she's completely spoiling Rhoda  Cunliffe and Hope Robertson. They used to be quite different before  Flossie came. I don't think Jessie Gray and Gladys Chesters have  improved either lately. It seems such a pity, because we've always  prided ourselves that St. Chad's was the best house in the College, and  we don't want this kind of element to creep in.\"    \"What can we do?\" asked Ruth Latimer.    \"Suppose we form a league against it! All the nicer girls would join,  and if Flossie and her set see that we really vote them bad style,  perhaps they'll have the sense to drop it.\"    \"All right. Put me down as your first member. What's the name of the  Society?\"    \"We might call it the 'Anti-Bounders'. It has a brisk, rolling sound  that's rather jolly.\"    \"The A.B.S. for short,\" suggested Honor.    \"And the rules?\" asked Ruth.    \"Those could be short and sweet--something on these lines:    \"1. No member is to make an unnecessary or ostentatious display of  wealth or valuables.    \"2. No member is to brag constantly of high connections or titled  friends.    \"3. Members are to consider, not money, but culture, as the standard of  public estimation at St. Chad's; and to remember that the essence of  good breeding is simplicity.    \"4. Any member transgressing any of these rules will be blackballed.\"    \"Excellent!\" said Ruth. \"It puts what we mean in a nutshell. Now, we  must write that out, and try to get signatures. We might add a fifth  rule, about not doing sneaking tricks; it's decidedly necessary.\"    \"And our motto could be _Noblesse oblige_,\" proposed Honor.    The \"Anti-Bounders\" met with favour among a large proportion of the  Chaddites, but with much derision from Flossie and her friends, who  lost no opportunity of ridiculing the league, nicknamed its members  \"The Pharisees\", and threw open scorn upon its rules. Nevertheless, in  spite of their opposition, the society was strong enough to work a  decided improvement, particularly among a certain section who were  ready to trim their sails according to the prevailing wind, and to  follow blindly the general consensus of public opinion. In future any  girl guilty of inordinate bragging was christened \"Chanticler\", and a  warning \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\" would advise her of the fact without  further explanation.    \"It's quite enough!\" said Maisie. \"We don't want to rub it in too hard,  but just to let them see that we notice. Jessie Gray is better already,  and although Flossie and Claudia make so much fun of us they're really  extremely nettled, because they thought themselves the absolute  perfection of good style, and it has been a great blow to them to  discover that three-quarters of the house consider them bad form.\"    It was a constant annoyance to Maisie, Lettice, and Pauline that  Flossie should occupy the fourth cubicle in No. 13 bedroom, and they  often wondered why Miss Maitland had placed so uncongenial a companion  in their midst--\"especially when Adeline Vaughan is with the  Hammond-Smiths in No. 10,\" said Lettice. \"If we might only make an  exchange, everybody would be satisfied.\"    Miss Maitland, however, had reasons for her arrangements, which she did  not care to explain. She knew far more of the inner life of the house  than the girls suspected, and hoped that by a judicious sandwiching of  different elements certain undesirable traits might be eliminated, and  the general tone raised. Though she was often aware of things that were  not entirely to her satisfaction, she was wise enough not to interfere  directly, but by careful tactics to allow the reformation to work from  within, experience having taught her that codes fixed by the girls  themselves"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24062"],[0,"A History of the United States (#18)"],[1,"the more conspicuous by contrast with the petty  rancour of his defeated rival, who not only refused to perform the  customary courtesy of welcoming his successor at the White House, but  spent his last hours there appointing Federalists feverishly to public  offices solely in order to compel Jefferson to choose between the  humiliation of retaining such servants and the odium of dismissing  them. The new President very rightly refused to recognize nominations so  made, and this has been seized upon by his detractors to hold him up as  the real author of what was afterwards called \"the Spoils System.\" It  would be far more just to place that responsibility upon Adams.    The most important event of Jefferson's first administration was the  Louisiana Purchase. The colony of Louisiana at the mouth of the  Mississippi, with its vast _hinterland_ stretching into the heart of the  American continent, had, as we have seen, passed in 1762 from French  into Spanish hands. Its acquisition by the United States had been an old  project of Jefferson's. When Secretary of State under Washington, he had  mooted it when settling with the Spanish Government the question of the  navigation of the Mississippi. As President he revived it; but before  negotiations could proceed far the whole situation was changed by the  retrocession of Louisiana to France as part of the terms dictated by  Napoleon to a Spain which had fallen completely under his control. The  United States could not, in any case, have regarded the transfer without  uneasiness, and to all schemes of purchase it seemed a death-blow, for  it was believed that the French Emperor had set his heart upon the  resurrection of French Colonial power in America. But Jefferson was an  excellent diplomatist, at once conciliatory and unyielding: he played  his cards shrewdly, and events helped him. The Peace of Amiens was  broken, and, after a very brief respite, England and France were again  at war. Napoleon's sagacity saw clearly enough that he could not hope to  hold and develop his new colony in the face of a hostile power which was  his master on the sea. It would suit his immediate purpose better to  replenish his treasury with good American dollars which might soon be  urgently needed. He became, therefore, as willing to sell as Jefferson  was to buy, and between two men of such excellent sense a satisfactory  bargain was soon struck. The colony of Louisiana and all the undeveloped  country which lay behind it became the inheritance of the American  Federation.    Concerning the transaction, there is more than one point to be noted of  importance to history. One is the light which it throws on Jefferson's  personal qualities. Because this man held very firmly an abstract and  reasoned theory of the State, could define and defend it with  extraordinary lucidity and logic, and avowedly guided his public conduct  by its light, there has been too much tendency to regard him as a mere  theorist, a sort of Girondia, noble in speculation and rhetoric, but  unequal to practical affairs and insufficiently alive to concrete  realities. He is often contrasted unfavourably with Hamilton in this  respect: and yet he had, as events proved, by far the acuter sense of  the trend of American popular opinion and the practical requirements of  a government that should command its respect; and he made fewer mistakes  in mere political tactics than did his rival. But his diplomacy is the  best answer to the charge. Let anyone who entertains it follow closely  the despatches relating to the Louisiana purchase, and observe how  shrewdly this supposed visionary can drive a good bargain for his  country, even when matched against Talleyrand with Bonaparte behind him.  One is reminded that before he entered politics he enjoyed among his  fellow-planters a reputation for exceptional business acumen.    Much more plausible is the accusation that Jefferson in the matter of  Louisiana forgot his principles, and acted in a manner grossly  inconsistent with his attitude when the Federalists were in power.  Certainly, the purchase can only be defended constitutionally by giving  a much larger construction to the powers of the Federal authority than  even Hamilton had ever promulgated. If the silence of the Constitution  on the subject must, as Jefferson had maintained, be taken as forbidding  Congress and the Executive to charter a bank, how much more must a  similar silence forbid them to expend millions in acquiring vast new  territories beyond the borders of the Confederacy. In point of fact,  Jefferson himself believed the step he and Congress were taking to be  beyond their present powers, and would have preferred to have asked for  a Constitutional Amendment to authorize it. But he readily gave way on  this to those who represented that such a course would give the  malcontent minority their chance, and perhaps jeopardize the whole  scheme. The fact is, that \"State Rights\" were not to Jefferson a first  principle, but a weapon which he used for the single purpose of  resisting oligarchy. His first principle, in which he never wavered for  a moment, was that laid down in the \"Declaration\"--the sovereignty of  the General Will. To him Federalism was nothing and State Sovereignty  was nothing but the keeping of the commandments of the people. Judged by  this test, both his opposition to Hamilton's bank and his purchase of  the Louisiana territory were justified; for on both occasions the nation  was with him.    Jefferson's inconsistency, therefore, if inconsistency it were, brought  him little discredit. It was far otherwise with the inconsistency of the  Federalists. For they also changed sides, and of their case it may be  said that, like Milton's Satan, they \"rode with darkness.\" The most  respectable part of their original political creed was their  nationalism, their desire for unity, and their support of a strong  central authority. Had this been really the dominant sentiment of their  connection, they could not but have supported Jefferson's policy, even  though they might not too unfairly have reproached him with stealing  their thunder. For not only was Jefferson's act a notable example of  their own theory of \"broad construction\" of the Constitution, but it was  perhaps a more fruitful piece of national statesmanship than the best of  Hamilton's measures, and it had a direct tendency to promote and  perpetuate that unity which the Federalists professed to value so  highly, for it gave to the States a new estate of vast extent and  incalculable potentialities, which they must perforce rule and develop  in common. But the Federalists forgot everything, even common prudence,  in their hatred of the man who had raised the people against them. To  injure him, most of them had been ready to conspire with a tainted  adventurer like Burr. They were now ready for the same object to tear up  the Union and all their principles with it. One of their ablest  spokesmen, Josiah Quincey, made a speech against the purchase, in which  he anticipated the most extreme pronouncements of the Nullifiers of 1832  and the Secessionists of 1860, declared that his country was not America  but Massachusetts, that to her alone his ultimate allegiance was due,  and that if her interests were violated by the addition of new Southern  territory in defiance of the Constitution, she would repudiate the Union  and take her stand upon her rights as an independent Sovereign State.    By such an attitude the Federalists destroyed only themselves. Some of  the wiser among them left the party on this issue, notably John Quincey  Adams, son of the second President of the United States, and himself to  be raised later, under somewhat disastrous circumstances, to the same  position. The rump that remained true, not to their principles but  rather to their vendetta, could make no headway against a virtually  unanimous nation. They merely completed and endorsed the general  judgment on their party by an act of suicide.    But the chief historical importance of the Louisiana purchase lies in  the fact that it gave a new and for long years an unlimited scope to  that irresistible movement of expansion westward which is the key to all  that age in American history. In the new lands a new kind of American  was growing up. Within a generation he was to come by his own; and a  Westerner in the chair of Washington was to revolutionize the  Commonwealth.    Of the governing conditions of the West, two stand out as of especial  importance to history.    One was the presence of unsubdued and hostile Indian tribes. Ever since  that extraordinary man, Daniel Boon (whose strange career would make an  epic for which there is no room in this book), crossed the Alleghanies a  decade before the beginning of the Revolution and made an opening for  the white race into the rich valleys of Kentucky, the history of the  western frontier of European culture had been a cycle of Indian wars.  The native race had not yet been either tamed or corrupted by  civilization. Powerful chiefs still ruled great territories as  independent potentates, and made peace and war with the white men on  equal terms. From such a condition it followed that courage and skill in  arms were in the West not merely virtues and accomplishments to be  admired, but necessities which a man must acquire or perish. The  Westerner was born a fighter, trained as a fighter, and the fighting  instinct was ever dominant in him. So also was the instinct of loyalty  to his fellow-citizens, a desperate, necessary loyalty as to comrades in  a besieged city--as, indeed, they often were.    The other condition was the product partly of natural circumstances and  partly of that wise stroke of statesmanship which had pledged the new  lands in trust to the whole Confederacy. The Westerner was  American--perhaps he was the first absolutely instinctive American. The  older States looked with much"]]]
