Next we enter the  north-east transept, which in its architectural features is practically a  repetition of the south-east transept, with which we have already dealt.  The monument to Archbishop Tait, designed by Boehm, is well worthy of its  surroundings. Above it, in the north wall, about ten feet from the ground,  we may notice three slits in the wall. These are what are called  hagioscopes. On the other side of the wall was a recess connected with the  Prior's Chapel. Through these hagioscopes--or \"holy spy-holes\"--the prior  could see mass being celebrated at the high altar and at the altars below  in the transept, without entering the cathedral. These transeptal altars  are in the Chapels of St. Martin and St. Stephen which occupy two apses in  the eastern wall. St. Martin is represented in a medallion of ancient  glass preserved in the modern window, as dividing his coat with a beggar.  Scratched on the walls are the names \"Lanfrancus\" and \"Ediva Regina;\" the  bodies of Lanfranc and Queen Ediva were removed to this transept after the  fire. Lanfranc originally lay in the old Trinity Chapel, and when this  building was levelled to the ground, he was \"carried to the vestiarium in  his leaden covering, and there deposited until the community should decide  what should be done with so great a Father.\" Apparently the heavy sheet of  lead was removed, for Gervase goes on to say that \"Lanfranc having  remained untouched for sixty-nine years, his very bones were consumed with  rottenness, and nearly all reduced to powder. The length of time, the damp  vestments, the natural frigidity of lead, and above all the frailty of the  human structure, had conspired to produce this corruption. But the larger  bones, with the remaining dust, were collected in a leaden coffer, and  deposited at the altar of St. Martin.\" Queen Ediva, as we learn from the  same authority, \"who before the fire reposed under a gilted _feretrum_ in  nearly the middle of the south cross, was now deposited at the altar of  St. Martin, under the _feretrum_ of Living,\" an archbishop who died in  1020. Ediva, the wife of Edward the Elder, and a generous benefactress  to the cathedral, died about 960.    From an early list of the subjects represented in the windows of the  cathedral, it appears that the north windows of the north-east transept  depicted the Parable of the Sower. The ancient glass, however, has been  displaced, and a good deal of it has been moved to the windows of the  north choir aisle, between the transept and the Chapel of the Martyrdom,  which are of great beauty, and should be examined carefully. In the  transept itself are windows in memory of Dean Stanley, Dr. Spry, and  Canon Cheshyre.    On the wall of the choir aisle, close to the transept, we can trace the  remains of a fresco representing the conversion of St. Hubert. Further on,  there hangs a picture, by Cross, which is intended to represent the murder  of Becket. As a work of art it is not without merit, but its details are  entirely inaccurate.    #The North-West Transept, or Chapel of the Martyrdom.#--The actual site  of the tragedy which rendered Becket and his cathedral famous throughout  Christendom was the North-West Transept, or as it was more commonly called  the Chapel of the Martyrdom. Hardly any portion, however, of this  structure as it stands actually witnessed the murder. In the time of  Becket the transept was of two storeys, divided by a vault, which was  upheld by a single pillar. The upper partition was dedicated to St.  Blaise, and the lower to St. Benedict. In the west wall, as now, was  a door which opened into the cloister.    [Illustration: THE MARTYRDOM, NORTH-WEST TRANSEPT.]    The story of Becket and his quarrel with Henry II. will be dealt with  in the next chapter. But before examining the spot on which he was  assassinated it is perhaps fitting to recall the events which immediately  preceded his death. Henry's wrathful exclamation, which stirred the four  knights to set out on their bloodthirsty mission, is well known. Whatever  we may think of the methods employed by these warriors--Fitzurse, de  Moreville, de Tracy, and le Bret were their names--we must at least  concede that they were gifted with undaunted courage. To slay an anointed  archbishop in his own cathedral was to do a deed from which the boldest  might well shrink, in the days when excommunication was held to be a  living reality, and the Church was believed to hold the power of eternal  blessing or damnation in her hand. These men--who were all closely  attached to the king's person, and were sometimes described as his  \"cubicularii,\" or Grooms of the Bedchamber--arrived at the gate of the  archbishop's palace in the afternoon of Tuesday, December 29th, 1170. With  a curious want of directness they seem to have left their swords outside,  and entered, and had a stormy interview with Becket; enraged by his  unyielding firmness, they went back for their weapons, and in the  meantime the archbishop was hurried by the terrified monks through the  cloister and into the cathedral, where the vesper service was being held.  The knights quickly forced their way after him, and the monks locked and  barricaded the cloister door. But Becket, who bore himself heroically  through the whole scene, insisted that the door should be thrown open,  exclaiming that \"the church must not be turned into a castle.\" Then all  the monks but three fled in terror. Those who stayed urged Becket to hide  himself in the crypt or in the Chapel of St. Blaise above. But he would  not hear of concealment, but preferred to make his way to the choir that  he might die at his post by the high altar. As he went up the steps  towards the choir the knights rushed into the transept, calling for \"the  archbishop, the traitor to the king,\" and Becket turned and came down, and  confronted them by the pillar of the chapel. Clad in his white rochet,  with a cloak and hood over his shoulders, he faced his murderers, who were  now girt in mail from head to foot. They tried to seize him and drag him  out of the sacred precinct, but he put his back against the pillar and  hurled Tracy full-length on the pavement. Then commending his cause and  the cause of the Church \"to God, to St. Denys, the martyr of France, to  St. Alfege, and to the saints of the Church,\" he fell under the blows of  the knights' swords. The last stroke was from the hand of le Bret, it  severed the crown of the archbishop's head, and the murderer's sword was  shivered into two pieces. Then the assassins left the church, ransacked  the palace, and plundered its treasures, and, lastly, rode off on horses  from the stables, in which Becket had to the last taken especial pride.    Such is the brief outline of the events of this remarkable tragedy, for  a fuller account of which we must refer our readers to the excellent  description in Stanley's \"Memorials of Canterbury.\" As we have already  said, the present transept has been entirely rebuilt; although not damaged  by the fire, it was reconstructed by Prior Chillenden at the time when he  erected the present nave. It is even doubtful whether the present pavement  is the same as that which was trodden by Becket and his murderers. A small  square stone is still shown in the floor of the transept, as marking the  exact spot on which the archbishop fell; it is said to have been inserted  in place of the original piece which was taken out and sent to Rome, but  there is little or no authority for this statement. On the other hand, we  read that Benedict, when he became Abbot of Peterborough, in order to  supply his new cathedral with relics, in which it was sadly deficient,  came back to Canterbury and carried off the stones which had been  sprinkled with St. Thomas's blood, and made therewith two altars for  Peterborough.    In this transept an altar was erected, called the Altar of the Martyrdom,  or the Altar of the Sword's Point (_altare ad punctum ensis_), from the  fact that upon it was laid the broken fragment of le Bret's sword, which  had been left on the pavement. Also, a portion of the martyr's brains were  kept under a piece of rock crystal, and a special official, called the  Custos Martyrii, was appointed to guard these relics.    The chief window in this chapel was presented by Edward IV.; in it we can  still see the figures of himself and his queen and his two daughters, and  the two young princes who were murdered in the Tower. It originally  contained representations of \"seven glorious appearances\" of the Virgin,  and Becket himself in the centre, but all this portion was destroyed by  Blue Dick, the Puritan zealot. The west window was the gift of the Rev.  Robert Moore, sometime Canon of Canterbury; it is an elaborate piece of  work depicting Becket's martyrdom and scenes in his life.    Here also we see the very beautiful and interesting monument to Archbishop  Peckham (1279-1292), the oldest Canterbury monument which survives in its  entirety; even it has been encroached upon by the commonplace erection  adjoining it, which commemorates Warham who was archbishop from 1503 to  1532, and was the friend of Erasmus.    #The Dean's Chapel.#--Eastward of the north-west transept is the chapel  which was formerly known as the Lady Chapel, but has latterly been named  the Dean's Chapel from the number of deans whose monuments have been  placed here. It stands on the site of the Chapel of St. Benedict, and was  built by Prior Goldstone, who dedicated it to the Blessed Virgin in 1460.  The usual place for the Lady Chapel in cathedrals is, of course, at the  extreme east end; but at Canterbury the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2284"],[0,"Animal Heroes (#18)"],[1," logs.    Good food, nursing, and medicine restored them all.    A month or two later, when the women wanted a new leaching-barrel, Thor  said: \"I know where there is a hollow basswood as big as a hogshead.\"    He and Corney went to the place, and when they cut off what they  needed, they found in the far end of it the dried-up bodies of two  little Lynxes with that of the mother, and in the side of the old one  was the head of a fish-spear broken from the handle.          LITTLE WARHORSE    The History of a Jack-rabbit    The Little Warhorse knew practically all the Dogs in town. First, there  was a very large brown Dog that had pursued him many times, a Dog that  he always got rid of by slipping through a hole in a board fence.  Second, there was a small active Dog that could follow through that  hole, and him he baffled by leaping a twenty-foot irrigation ditch that  had steep sides and a swift current. The Dog could not make this leap.  It was \"sure medicine\" for that foe, and the boys still call the place  \"Old Jacky's Jump.\" But there was a Greyhound that could leap better  than the Jack, and when he could not follow through a fence, he jumped  over it. He tried the Warhorse's mettle more than once, and Jacky only  saved himself by his quick dodging, till they got to an Osage hedge,  and here the Greyhound had to give it up. Besides these, there was in  town a rabble of big and little Dogs that were troublesome, but easily  left behind in the open.    In the country there was a Dog at each farm-house, but only one that  the Warhorse really feared; that was a long-legged, fierce, black Dog,  a brute so swift and pertinacious that he had several times forced the  Warhorse almost to the last extremity.    For the town Cats he cared little; only once or twice had he been  threatened by them. A huge Tom-cat flushed with many victories came  crawling up to where he fed one moonlight night. Jack Warhorse saw the  black creature with the glowing eyes, and a moment before the final  rush, he faced it, raised up on his haunches,--his hind legs,--at full  length on his toes,--with his broad ears towering up yet six inches  higher; then letting out a loud churrr-churrr, his best attempt at a  roar, he sprang five feet forward and landed on the Cat's head, driving  in his sharp hind nails, and the old Tom fled in terror from the weird  two-legged giant. This trick he had tried several times with success,  but twice it turned out a sad failure: once, when the Cat proved to be  a mother whose Kittens were near; then Jack Warhorse had to flee for  his life; and the other time was when he made the mistake of landing  hard on a Skunk.    But the Greyhound was the dangerous enemy, and in him the Warhorse  might have found his fate, but for a curious adventure with a happy  ending for Jack.    He fed by night; there were fewer enemies about then, and it was easier  to hide; but one day at dawn in winter he had lingered long at an  alfalfa stack and was crossing the open snow toward his favorite form,  when, as ill-luck would have it, he met the Greyhound prowling outside  the town. With open snow and growing daylight there was no chance to  hide, nothing but a run in the open with soft snow that hindered the  Jack more than it did the Hound.    Off they went--superb runners in fine fettle. How they skimmed across  the snow, raising it in little puff-puff-puffs, each time their nimble  feet went down. This way and that, swerving and dodging, went the  chase. Everything favored the Dog,--his empty stomach, the cold  weather, the soft snow,--while the Rabbit was handicapped by his heavy  meal of alfalfa. But his feet went puff--puff so fast that a dozen of  the little snow-jets were in view at once. The chase continued in the  open; no friendly hedge was near, and every attempt to reach a fence  was cleverly stopped by the Hound. Jack's ears were losing their bold  up-cock, a sure sign of failing heart or wind, when all at once these  flags went stiffly up, as under sudden renewal of strength. The  Warhorse put forth all his power, not to reach the hedge to the north,  but over the open prairie eastward. The Greyhound followed, and within  fifty yards the Jack dodged to foil his fierce pursuer; but on the next  tack he was on his eastern course again, and so tacking and dodging, he  kept the line direct for the next farm-house, where was a very high  board fence with a hen-hole, and where also there dwelt his other hated  enemy, the big black Dog. An outer hedge delayed the Greyhound for a  moment and gave Jack time to dash through the hen-hole into the yard,  where he hid to one side. The Greyhound rushed around to the low gate,  leaped over that among the Hens, and as they fled cackling and  fluttering, some Lambs bleated loudly. Their natural guardian, the big  black Dog, ran to the rescue, and Warhorse slipped out again by the  hole at which he had entered. Horrible sounds of Dog hate and fury were  heard behind him in the hen-yard, and soon the shouts of men were  added. How it ended he did not know or seek to learn, but it was  remarkable that he never afterward was troubled by the swift Greyhound  that formerly lived in Newchusen.      II    Hard times and easy times had long followed in turn and been taken as  matters of course; but recent years in the State of Kaskado had brought  to the Jack-rabbits a succession of remarkable ups and downs. In the  old days they had their endless fight with Birds and Beasts of Prey,  with cold and heat, with pestilence and with flies whose sting bred a  loathsome disease, and yet had held their own. But the settling of the  country by farmers made many changes.    Dogs and guns arriving in numbers reduced the ranks of Coyotes, Foxes,  Wolves, Badgers, and Hawks that preyed on the Jack, so that in a few  years the Rabbits were multiplied in great swarms; but now Pestilence  broke out and swept them away. Only the strongest--the  double-seasoned--remained. For a while a Jack-rabbit was a rarity; but  during this time another change came in. The Osage-orange hedges  planted everywhere afforded a new refuge, and now the safety of a  Jack-rabbit was less often his speed than his wits, and the wise ones,  when pursued by a Dog or Coyote, would rush to the nearest hedge  through a small hole and escape while the enemy sought for a larger one  by which to follow. The Coyotes rose to this and developed the trick of  the relay chase. In this one Coyote takes one field, another the next,  and if the Rabbit attempts the \"hedge-ruse\" they work from each side  and usually win their prey. The Rabbit remedy for this, is keen eyes to  see the second Coyote, avoidance of that field, then good legs to  distance the first enemy.    Thus the Jack-rabbits, after being successively numerous, scarce, in  myriads, and rare, were now again on the increase, and those which  survived, selected by a hundred hard trials, were enabled to flourish  where their ancestors could not have outlived a single season.    Their favorite grounds were, not the broad open stretches of the big  ranches, but the complicated, much-fenced fields of the farms, where  these were so small and close as to be like a big straggling village.    One of these vegetable villages had sprung up around the railway  station of Newchusen. The country a mile away was well supplied with  Jack-rabbits of the new and selected stock. Among them was a little  lady Rabbit called \"Bright-eyes,\" from her leading characteristic as  she sat gray in the gray brush. She was a good runner, but was  especially successful with the fence-play that baffled the Coyotes. She  made her nest out in an open pasture, an untouched tract of the ancient  prairie. Here her brood were born and raised. One like herself was  bright-eyed, in coat of silver-gray, and partly gifted with her ready  wits, but in the other, there appeared a rare combination of his  mother's gifts with the best that was in the best strain of the new  Jack-rabbits of the plains.    This was the one whose adventures we have been following, the one that  later on the turf won the name of Little Warhorse and that afterward  achieved a world-wide fame.    Ancient tricks of his kind he revived and put to new uses, and ancient  enemies he learned to fight with new-found tricks.    When a mere baby he discovered a plan that was worthy of the wisest  Rabbit in Kaskado. He was pursued by a horrible little Yellow Dog, and  he had tried in vain to get rid of him by dodging among the fields and  farms. This is good play against a Coyote, because the farmers and the  Dogs will often help the Jack, without knowing it, by attacking the  Coyote. But now the plan did not work at all, for the little Dog  managed to keep after him through one fence after another, and Jack  Warhorse, not yet full-grown, much less seasoned, was beginning to feel  the strain. His ears were no longer up straight, but angling back and  at times drooping to a level, as he darted through a very little hole  in an Osage hedge, only to find that his nimble enemy had done the same  without loss of time. In the middle of the field was a small herd of  cattle and with them a calf.    There is in wild animals a curious impulse to trust any stranger when  in desperate straits. The foe behind they know means death. There is  just a chance, and the only one left, that the stranger may prove  friendly; and it was this last desperate chance that drew Jack Warhorse  to the Cows.    It is quite sure that the Cows would have stood by in stolid  indifference so far as the Rabbit was concerned, but they have a  deep-rooted hatred of a dog, and when they saw the Yellow Cur coming  bounding toward them, their tails and noses went up; they sniffed  angrily, then closed up ranks, and led by the Cow that owned the Calf,  they charged at the Dog, while Jack took refuge under a low thorn-bush.  The Dog swerved aside to attack the Calf, at least the old Cow"]]]
