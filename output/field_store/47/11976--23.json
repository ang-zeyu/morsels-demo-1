Maimie had often heard St. Paul's before, but never as it was chanted  by Straight Rory and sung by the Indian Lands congregation that day.  The extraordinary slides and slurs almost obliterated the notes of the  original tune, and the \"little kick,\" as Maimie called it, at the end of  the second line, gave her a little start.    \"Auntie,\" she whispered, \"isn't it awfully queer?\"    \"Isn't it beautiful?\" her aunt answered, with an uncertain smile. She  was remembering how these winding, sliding, slurring old tunes had  affected her when first she heard them in her husband's church years  ago. The stately movement, the weird quavers, and the pathetic cadences  had in some mysterious way reached the deep places in her heart, and  before she knew, she had found the tears coursing down her cheeks and  her breath catching in sobs. Indeed, as she listened to-day, remembering  these old impressions, the tears began to flow, till Hughie, not  understanding, crept over to his mother, and to comfort her, slipped  his hand into hers, looking fiercely at Maimie as if she were to  blame. Maimie, too, noticed the tears and sat wondering, and as the  congregation swung on through the verses of the grand old psalm there  crept into her heart a new and deeper emotion than she had ever known.    \"Listen to the words, Maimie dear,\" whispered her aunt. And as Maimie  listened, the noble words, borne on the mighty swing of St. Paul's,  lifted up by six hundred voices--for men, women, and children were  singing with all their hearts--awakened echoes from great deeps within  her as yet unsounded. The days for such singing are, alas! long gone.  The noble rhythm, the stately movement, the continuous curving stream of  melody, that once marked the praise service of the old Scottish church,  have given place to the light, staccato tinkle of the revival chorus, or  the shorn and mutilated skeleton of the ancient psalm tune.    But while the psalm had been moving on in its solemn and stately way,  Ranald had been enduring agony at the hands of Peter Ruagh sitting just  behind him. Peter, whose huge, clumsy body was a fitting tabernacle for  the soul within, labored under the impression that he was a humorist,  and indulged a habit of ponderous joking, trying enough to most people,  but to one of Ranald's temperament exasperating to a high degree. His  theme was Ranald's rescue of Maimie, and the pauses of the singing he  filled in with humorous comments that, outside, would have produced only  weariness, but in the church, owing to the strange perversity of human  nature, sent a snicker along the seat. Unfortunately for him, Ranald's  face was so turned that he could not see it, and so he had no hint of  the wrath that was steadily boiling up to the point of overflow.    They were nearing the close of the last verse of the psalm, when Hughie,  whose eyes never wandered long from Ranald's direction, uttered a sharp  \"Oh, my!\" There was a shuffling confusion under the gallery, and when  Maimie and her aunt looked, Peter Ruagh's place was vacant.    By this time the minister was standing up for prayer. His eye, too,  caught the movement in the back seat.    \"Young men,\" he said, sternly, \"remember you are in God's house. Let me  not have to mention your names before the congregation. Let us pray.\"    As the congregation rose for prayer, Mrs. Murray noticed Peter Ruagh  appear from beneath the book-board and quietly slip out by the back door  with his hand to his face and the blood streaming between his fingers;  and though Ranald was standing up straight and stiff in his place, Mrs.  Murray could read from his rigid look the explanation of Peter's bloody  face. She gave her mind to the prayer with a sore heart, for she had  learned enough of those wild, hot-headed youths to know that before  Peter Ruagh's face would be healed more blood would have to flow.    The prayer proceeded in its leisurely way, indulging here and there  in quiet reverie, or in exultant jubilation over the \"attributes,\"  embracing in its worldwide sweep \"the interests of the kingdom\" far and  near, and of that part of humanity included therein present and to come,  and buttressing its petitions with theological argument, systematic and  unassailable. Before the close, however, the minister came to deal with  the needs of his own people. Old and young, absent and present, the  sick, the weary, the sin-burdened--all were remembered with a warmth  of sympathy, with a directness of petition, and with an earnestness of  appeal that thrilled and subdued the hearts of all, and made even the  boys, who had borne with difficulty the last half-hour of the long  prayer, forget their weariness.    The reading of Scripture followed the prayer. In this the minister  excelled. His fine voice and his dramatic instinct combined to make this  an impressive and beautiful portion of the service. But to-day much of  the beauty and impressiveness of the reading was lost by the frequent  interruptions caused by the entrance of late comers, of whom, owing to  the bad roads, there were a larger number than usual. The minister was  evidently annoyed, not so much by the opening and shutting of the door  as by the inattention of his hearers, who kept turning round their heads  to see who the new arrivals were. At length the minister could bear it  no longer.    \"My dear people,\" he said, pausing in the reading, \"never mind those  coming in. Give you heed to the reading of God's Word, and if you must  know who are entering, I will tell you. Yes,\" he added, deliberately,  \"give you heed to me, and I will let you know who these late comers  are.\"    With that startling declaration, he proceeded with the reading, but had  not gone more than a few verses when \"click\" went the door-latch. Not  a head turned. It was Malcolm Monroe, slow-going and good-natured, with  his quiet little wife following him.    The minister paused, looking toward the door, and announced: \"My dear  people, here comes our friend Malcolm Monroe, and his good wife with  him, and a long walk they have had. Come away, Malcolm; come away; we  will just wait for you.\"    Malcolm's face was a picture. Surprise, astonishment, and confusion  followed each other across his stolid countenance; and with quicker pace  than he was ever known to use in his life before, he made his way to  his seat. No sooner had the reading began again when once more the  door clicked. True to his promise, the minister paused and cheerfully  announced to his people: \"This, my friends, is John Campbell, whom  you all know as 'Johnnie Sarah,' and we are very glad to see him, for,  indeed, he has not been here for some time. Come away, John; come away,  man,\" he added, impatiently, \"for we are all waiting for you.\"    Johnnie Sarah stood paralyzed with amazement and seemed uncertain  whether to advance or to turn and flee. The minister's impatient  command, however, decided him, and he dropped into the nearest seat with  all speed, and gazed about him as if to discover where he was. He had  no sooner taken his seat than the door opened again, and some half-dozen  people entered. The minister stood looking at them for some moments and  then said, in a voice of resignation: \"Friends, these are some of our  people from the Island, and there are some strangers with them. But  if you want to know who they are, you will just have to look at them  yourselves, for I must get on with the reading.\"    Needless to say, not a soul of the congregation, however consumed with  curiosity, dared to look around, and the reading of the chapter went  gravely on to the close. To say that Maimie sat in utter astonishment  during this extraordinary proceeding would give but a faint idea of her  state of mind. Even Mrs. Murray herself, who had become accustomed to  her husband's eccentricities, sat in a state of utter bewilderment, not  knowing what might happen next; nor did she feel quite safe until the  text was announced and the sermon fairly begun.    Important as were the exercises of reading, praise, and prayer, they  were only the \"opening services,\" and merely led up to the event of the  day, which was the sermon. And it was the event, not only of the day,  but of the week. It would form the theme of conversation and afford food  for discussion in every gathering of the people until another came to  take its place. To-day it lasted a full hour and a half, and was an  extraordinary production. Calm, deliberate reasoning, flights of vivid  imagination, passionate denunciation, and fervid appeal, marked its  course. Its subject was the great doctrine of Justification by Faith,  and it contained a complete system of theology arranged with reference  to that doctrine. Ancient heresies were attacked and exposed with  completeness amounting to annihilation. Modern errors, into which our  \"friends\" of the different denominations had fallen, were deplored and  corrected, and all possible misapplications of the doctrine to practical  life guarded against. On the positive side the need, the ground, the  means, the method, the agent, the results, of Justification, were fully  set forth and illustrated. There were no anecdotes and no poetry.  The subject was much too massive and tremendous to permit of any such  trifling.    As the sermon rolled on its majestic course, the congregation listened  with an attentive and discriminating appreciation that testified to  their earnestness and intelligence. True, one here and there dropped  into a momentary doze, but his slumber was never easy, for he was  harassed by the terrible fear of a sudden summons by name from the  pulpit to \"awake and give heed to the message,\" which for the next few  minutes would have an application so personal and pungent that it would  effectually prevent sleep for that and some successive Sabbaths."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3289"],[0,"The Valley of Fear (#18)"],[1,"land.          Chapter 2--The Bodymaster        McMurdo was a man who made his mark quickly. Wherever he was the folk  around soon knew it. Within a week he had become infinitely the most  important person at Shafter's. There were ten or a dozen boarders there;  but they were honest foremen or commonplace clerks from the stores, of a  very different calibre from the young Irishman. Of an evening when they  gathered together his joke was always the readiest, his conversation the  brightest, and his song the best. He was a born boon companion, with a  magnetism which drew good humour from all around him.    And yet he showed again and again, as he had shown in the railway  carriage, a capacity for sudden, fierce anger, which compelled the  respect and even the fear of those who met him. For the law, too, and  all who were connected with it, he exhibited a bitter contempt which  delighted some and alarmed others of his fellow boarders.    From the first he made it evident, by his open admiration, that the  daughter of the house had won his heart from the instant that he had set  eyes upon her beauty and her grace. He was no backward suitor. On  the second day he told her that he loved her, and from then onward he  repeated the same story with an absolute disregard of what she might say  to discourage him.    \"Someone else?\" he would cry. \"Well, the worse luck for someone else!  Let him look out for himself! Am I to lose my life's chance and all my  heart's desire for someone else? You can keep on saying no, Ettie: the  day will come when you will say yes, and I'm young enough to wait.\"    He was a dangerous suitor, with his glib Irish tongue, and his pretty,  coaxing ways. There was about him also that glamour of experience and  of mystery which attracts a woman's interest, and finally her love. He  could talk of the sweet valleys of County Monaghan from which he came,  of the lovely, distant island, the low hills and green meadows of which  seemed the more beautiful when imagination viewed them from this place  of grime and snow.    Then he was versed in the life of the cities of the North, of Detroit,  and the lumber camps of Michigan, and finally of Chicago, where he had  worked in a planing mill. And afterwards came the hint of romance, the  feeling that strange things had happened to him in that great city,  so strange and so intimate that they might not be spoken of. He spoke  wistfully of a sudden leaving, a breaking of old ties, a flight into  a strange world, ending in this dreary valley, and Ettie listened, her  dark eyes gleaming with pity and with sympathy--those two qualities  which may turn so rapidly and so naturally to love.      McMurdo had obtained a temporary job as bookkeeper for he was a  well-educated man. This kept him out most of the day, and he had not  found occasion yet to report himself to the head of the lodge of the  Eminent Order of Freemen. He was reminded of his omission, however, by  a visit one evening from Mike Scanlan, the fellow member whom he had met  in the train. Scanlan, the small, sharp-faced, nervous, black-eyed man,  seemed glad to see him once more. After a glass or two of whisky he  broached the object of his visit.    \"Say, McMurdo,\" said he, \"I remembered your address, so I made bold  to call. I'm surprised that you've not reported to the Bodymaster. Why  haven't you seen Boss McGinty yet?\"    \"Well, I had to find a job. I have been busy.\"    \"You must find time for him if you have none for anything else. Good  Lord, man! you're a fool not to have been down to the Union House and  registered your name the first morning after you came here! If you run  against him--well, you mustn't, that's all!\"    McMurdo showed mild surprise. \"I've been a member of the lodge for over  two years, Scanlan, but I never heard that duties were so pressing as  all that.\"    \"Maybe not in Chicago.\"    \"Well, it's the same society here.\"    \"Is it?\"    Scanlan looked at him long and fixedly. There was something sinister in  his eyes.    \"Isn't it?\"    \"You'll tell me that in a month's time. I hear you had a talk with the  patrolmen after I left the train.\"    \"How did you know that?\"    \"Oh, it got about--things do get about for good and for bad in this  district.\"    \"Well, yes. I told the hounds what I thought of them.\"    \"By the Lord, you'll be a man after McGinty's heart!\"    \"What, does he hate the police too?\"    Scanlan burst out laughing. \"You go and see him, my lad,\" said he as  he took his leave. \"It's not the police but you that he'll hate if you  don't! Now, take a friend's advice and go at once!\"      It chanced that on the same evening McMurdo had another more pressing  interview which urged him in the same direction. It may have been that  his attentions to Ettie had been more evident than before, or that they  had gradually obtruded themselves into the slow mind of his good German  host; but, whatever the cause, the boarding-house keeper beckoned the  young man into his private room and started on the subject without any  circumlocution.    \"It seems to me, mister,\" said he, \"that you are gettin' set on my  Ettie. Ain't that so, or am I wrong?\"    \"Yes, that is so,\" the young man answered.    \"Vell, I vant to tell you right now that it ain't no manner of use.  There's someone slipped in afore you.\"    \"She told me so.\"    \"Vell, you can lay that she told you truth. But did she tell you who it  vas?\"    \"No, I asked her; but she wouldn't tell.\"    \"I dare say not, the leetle baggage! Perhaps she did not vish to  frighten you avay.\"    \"Frighten!\" McMurdo was on fire in a moment.    \"Ah, yes, my friend! You need not be ashamed to be frightened of him. It  is Teddy Baldwin.\"    \"And who the devil is he?\"    \"He is a boss of Scowrers.\"    \"Scowrers! I've heard of them before. It's Scowrers here and Scowrers  there, and always in a whisper! What are you all afraid of? Who are the  Scowrers?\"    The boarding-house keeper instinctively sank his voice, as everyone did  who talked about that terrible society. \"The Scowrers,\" said he, \"are  the Eminent Order of Freemen!\"    The young man stared. \"Why, I am a member of that order myself.\"    \"You! I vould never have had you in my house if I had known it--not if  you vere to pay me a hundred dollar a veek.\"    \"What's wrong with the order? It's for charity and good fellowship. The  rules say so.\"    \"Maybe in some places. Not here!\"    \"What is it here?\"    \"It's a murder society, that's vat it is.\"    McMurdo laughed incredulously. \"How can you prove that?\" he asked.    \"Prove it! Are there not fifty murders to prove it? Vat about Milman and  Van Shorst, and the Nicholson family, and old Mr. Hyam, and little  Billy James, and the others? Prove it! Is there a man or a voman in this  valley vat does not know it?\"    \"See here!\" said McMurdo earnestly. \"I want you to take back what you've  said, or else make it good. One or the other you must do before I quit  this room. Put yourself in my place. Here am I, a stranger in the town.  I belong to a society that I know only as an innocent one. You'll  find it through the length and breadth of the States, but always as an  innocent one. Now, when I am counting upon joining it here, you tell me  that it is the same as a murder society called the Scowrers. I guess you  owe me either an apology or else an explanation, Mr. Shafter.\"    \"I can but tell you vat the whole vorld knows, mister. The bosses of the  one are the bosses of the other. If you offend the one, it is the other  vat vill strike you. We have proved it too often.\"    \"That's just gossip--I want proof!\" said McMurdo.    \"If you live here long you vill get your proof. But I forget that you  are yourself one of them. You vill soon be as bad as the rest. But you  vill find other lodgings, mister. I cannot have you here. Is it not bad  enough that one of these people come courting my Ettie, and that I dare  not turn him down, but that I should have another for my boarder? Yes,  indeed, you shall not sleep here after to-night!\"      McMurdo found himself under sentence of banishment both from his  comfortable quarters and from the girl whom he loved. He found her alone  in the sitting-room that same evening, and he poured his troubles into  her ear.    \"Sure, your father is after giving me notice,\" he said. \"It's little I  would care if it was just my room, but indeed, Ettie, though it's only  a week that I've known you, you are the very breath of life to me, and I  can't live without you!\"    \"Oh, hush, Mr. McMurdo, don't speak so!\" said the girl. \"I have told  you, have I not, that you are too late? There is another, and if I have  not promised to marry him at once, at least I can promise no one else.\"    \"Suppose I had been first, Ettie, would I have had a chance?\"    The girl sank her face into her hands. \"I wish to heaven that you had  been first!\" she sobbed.    McMurdo was down on his knees before her in an instant. \"For God's sake,  Ettie, let it stand at that!\" he cried. \"Will you ruin your life and  my own for the sake of this promise? Follow your heart, acushla! 'Tis a  safer guide than any promise before you knew what it was that you were  saying.\"    He had seized Ettie's white hand between his own strong brown ones.    \"Say that you will be mine, and we will face it out together!\"    \"Not here?\"    \"Yes, here.\"    \"No, no, Jack!\" His arms were round her now. \"It could not be here.  Could you take me away?\"    A struggle passed for a moment over McMurdo's face; but it ended by  setting like granite. \"No, here,\" he said. \"I'll hold you against the  world, Ettie, right here where we are!\"    \"Why should we not leave together?\"    \"No, Ettie, I can't leave here.\"    \"But why?\"    \"I'd never hold my head up again if I felt that I had been driven out.  Besides, what is there to be afraid of? Are we not free folks in a free  country? If you love me, and I you, who will dare to come between?\"    \"You don't know, Jack. You'"]]]
