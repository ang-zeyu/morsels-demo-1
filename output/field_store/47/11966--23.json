The first is intended to     regulate the form and the external exercise of religion; the     second, to sanctify and perfect man's inward being.  Each     brings to the examination of the text a preconceived notion, as     it were; and it reconciles text and preconceived notion     sometimes by traditional, sometimes by arbitrary, methods,     often more ingenious than rational.  The Peshat, on the     contrary, subordinates its own ideas to the text, wishes to     see in the text only what is actually there, and examines it     without bias....       The pious instructors of the people felt the need of utilizing     and applying to daily life as much as possible these Holy     Scriptures, the one treasure that had escaped so many     shipwrecks.  That a word should have but one meaning, that a     phrase should have but one subject, this seemed mean, shabby,     inadequate, unworthy the Supreme Wisdom that inspired the     Bible.  The word of God was perforce more prolific.  Each new     interpretation of the Biblical text added richness and new     value to the precious heritage....  Another very important     circumstance, if it did not originate the Midrashic method, at     all events tended strongly to bring it into vogue.  I speak of     the religious life, such as it was among the Israelites,     especially in the time of the second Temple.  A number of     practices, more or less sacred and more or less obligatory,     were established in, or after this period, either by     rabbinical institution, or by virtue of the oral law or of     custom; and these practices, sanctioned by long usage or by     highly esteemed authorities, had no apparent basis in the     written law.  To maintain them and give them solidity in the     regard of the people, it was natural to seek to prove by     exegesis <I>ad hoc</I> that the Holy Text had imposed or     recommended them in advance, if not expressly, at least by     hints and allusions....  The application of this method was     called forth not only by the religious practices, but also by     the ideas and opinions that had been formed or developed in     the same period.  After the Babylonian Exile the successive     influence of the Chaldeans, the Persians, and the Greeks     produced among the Jews of Asia as well as among the Jews of     Egypt certain theories concerning cosmogony, angels, and the     government of the world, which rapidly gained credence, and     were generally held to be incontestable.  These theories     provided a complete apparatus of doctrines so attractive and     so enthusiastically accepted even by our teachers, that the     people could not resign themselves to the belief that they     were not contained in the Bible, or, worse still, that they     were contradicted by this store-house of wisdom and truth.  But     these doctrines - for the most part, at least - are not to be     found in the literal text of the Bible, and, as a consequence,     the scholars turned to the Midrashic method as the only one     calculated to read the desired meaning into the text.    Now the general character of Judaism had not changed perceptibly  during ten centuries.  In the eleventh century the Jews had the  same needs as in the first, and the same method of satisfying  their needs.  They found it quite natural to bring their ideas  into agreement with the Bible - or, rather, they did so  unconsciously - and to twist the text from its natural meaning,  so as to ascribe to the Biblical authors their own ideas and  knowledge.    Yet, however great the favor attaching to this method, the Peshat  was never entirely deprived of its rights.  It was even destined  to soar high into prominence.  The appearance of the Karaites  (eighth century), who rejected the Talmud and held exclusively to  the Scriptures, brought into existence, either directly or  indirectly, a rational, independent method of exegesis, though  the influence of this sect upon the development of Biblical  studies has been grossly magnified.  It was the celebrated Saadia  (892-942) who by his translation of, and commentary upon, the  Bible opened up a new period in the history of exegesis, during  which the natural method was applied to the interpretation of  Biblical texts.  The productions of this period deserve a  commanding position in Jewish literature, as much for their  intrinsic value as for their number.    While, however, in the countries of Arabic culture, natural  exegesis made its way triumphantly, in the countries of Christian  Europe, it freed itself from the traditional Midrash only with  difficulty.  Moreover, Derash - to carry a Jewish term into an  alien field - was the method always employed by the Christian  theologians.  Throughout the medieval ages they adhered chiefly to  a spiritual, allegoric, moral, and mystic interpretation.  In the  employment of this method the literary, grammatical, philologic,  and historical aspect is perforce neglected.  Nevertheless, even  among Christian scholars the rational method found some worthy  representatives, especially among the Belgian masters.[61]    The deplorable ease of the Midrashic method readily accounts for  its vogue.  The Haggadist is not compelled to hold fast to his  text, his imagination has free play, and is untrammelled  [untrameled sic] by the leading-strings of grammar and good  sense.  The task of the exegete properly so called is quite  different.  He may not find in the text anything which is not  actually there.  He must take heed of the context, of the  probable, and of the rules of the language.  The exegete searches  for the idea in the text; the Haggadist introduces foreign ideas  into the text.       \"At the same time, whatever the attraction of the Midrashic     method for the Jews of France and Germany, and however great     the wealth of their material, neither this attraction nor this     wealth could take the place of a pure, simple explanation of     the genuine meaning of Scriptures, a meaning which often     served as a basis for the Midrash, and in a vast number of     cases would have remained obscure and incomplete.  Here there     was a yawning gap in an essential matter, and the man who had     the honor of filling up this gap - and with marvellous     [marvelous sic] success, considering the insufficiency of his     scientific resources - was one of the most eminent scholars of     the Synagogue, the leader of Jewish science, Rashi.\"[62]    It would be unjust to ignore the efforts of two of Rashi's  predecessors, Moses ha-Darshan (first half of the eleventh  century) and Menahem ben Helbo, who prepared the way and rendered  the task easier for him.  The principal work of Moses ha-Darshan,  often cited by Rashi under the title of <I>Yesod,</I>  \"Foundation,\" is a Haggadic and mystic commentary, giving,  however, some place to questions of grammar and of the natural  construction of the text.  As to Menahem ben Helbo, a certain  number of his explanations and fragments of his commentaries have  been preserved; but Rashi probably knew him only through the  intermediation of his nephew Joseph Kara.  Following the example  of Moses ha-Darshan and possibly, also, of Menahem ben Helbo,  Rashi used both the Peshat and the Derash in his Biblical  commentaries.  \"Rashi,\" says Berliner, \"employed an in-between  method, in which the Peshat and the Derash were easily united,  owing to the care he exercised, to choose from the one or the  other only what most directly approximated the simple meaning of  the text.  Rashi was free in his treatment of traditional legends,  now transforming, now lengthening, now abridging them or joining  several narratives in one, according to expediency.\"    This opinion is comprehensive; but it is necessary to emphasize  and differentiate.    As a rule, when the Midrash does no violence to the text, Rashi  adopts its interpretation; and when there are several Midrashic  interpretations, he chooses the one that accords best with the  simple sense; but he is especially apt to fall back upon the  Midrash when the passage does not offer any difficulties.  On the  contrary, if the text cannot be brought into harmony with the  Midrash, Rashi frankly declares that the Midrashic interpretation  is irreconcilable with the natural meaning or with the laws of  grammar.  He also rejects the Midrashic interpretation if it does  not conform to the context.  \"A passage,\" he said, \"should be  explained, not detached from its setting, but according to the  context.\"  In other cases he says, \"The real meaning of the verse  is different,\" and again, \"This verse admits of a Midrashic  interpretation, but I do not pretend to give any but the natural  meaning.\" Rashi was fond of repeating the following Talmudic  saying, which he elevated into a principle: \"A verse cannot  escape its simple meaning, its natural acceptation.\" Rashi, then,  cherished a real predilection for rational and literal exegesis,  but when he could not find a satisfactory explanation according  to this method, or when tradition offered one, he resigned  himself to the Haggadic method, saying: \"This verse requires an  explanation according to the Midrash, and it cannot be explained  in any other way.\"    A few quotations will facilitate the comprehension of this  characteristic method.                   1.  CREATION OF THE WORLD (Genesis 1.1)       <I>In the beginning</I>].  R. Isaac[63] says: The Law ought to     have begun with the rule enjoining the celebration of     Passover, which is the first of the Mosaic precepts.  But God     \"showed his"]]]
