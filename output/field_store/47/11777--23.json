Armed with Ellangowan's warrant, and guided by  his people who knew the country, Kennedy swooped down upon Dirk  Hatteraick as he was in the act of landing a large cargo upon  Ellangowan's ground. After a severe combat he had been able to clap the  government broad-arrow upon every package and carry them all off to the  nearest customs' post. Dirk Hatteraick got safely away, but he went,  vowing in English, Dutch, and German, the direst vengeance against Frank  Kennedy, Godfrey Bertram, and all his enemies.    It was a day or two after the eviction of the gipsies when the Lady of  Ellangowan, suddenly remembering that it was her son Harry's fifth  birthday, demanded of her husband that he should open and read the  horoscope written by the wandering student of the stars five years  before. While they were arguing about the matter, it was suddenly  discovered that little Harry was nowhere to be found. His guardian,  Dominie Sampson, having returned without him, was summoned to give an  account of his stewardship by the angry mother.    \"Mr. Sampson,\" she cried, \"it is the most extraordinary thing in the  world wide, that you have free up-putting in this house,--bed, board,  washing, and twelve pounds sterling a year just to look after that  boy,--and here you have let him out of your sight for three hours at a  time!\"    Bowing with awkward gratitude at each clause in this statement of his  advantages, the poor Dominie was at last able to stammer out that Frank  Kennedy had taken charge of Master Harry, in the face of his protest,  and had carried him off to Warroch Head to see the taking of Dirk  Hatteraick's ship by the King's sloop-of-war, which he had ridden all  the way to Wigton Bay to bring about.    \"And if that be so,\" cried the Lady of Ellangowan, \"I am very little  obliged to Frank Kennedy. The bairn may fall from his horse, or anything  may happen.\"    The Laird quieted his wife by telling her that he and Frank Kennedy had  together seen the sloop-of-war giving chase to Dirk Hatteraick's ship,  and that even then the Dutchman, disabled and on fire, was fast drifting  upon the rocks. Frank Kennedy had ridden off to assist in the capture by  signalling to the man-of-war from Warroch Head, and had evidently picked  up little Harry upon the way. He would doubtless, continued the Laird,  be back in a little time. For he had ordered the punch-bowl to be made  ready, that they might drink good luck to the King's service and  confusion to all smugglers and free-traders wherever found.    But hour after hour went by, and neither Frank Kennedy nor the boy Harry  returned. The night approached. Parties of searchers anxiously beat the  woods and patrolled the cliffs. For long they found nothing, but at last  a boat's crew, landing perilously at the foot of the precipices, came  upon the body of the excise officer, a sword-cut in his head, lying  half in and half out of the water. He had been flung from the cliffs  above. Frank Kennedy was dead--as to that there was no question. But  what had become of the child, Harry Bertram? That--no one could answer.  Not a trace of him was to be found. The smuggler's ship still burned  fiercely, but Dirk Hatteraick and his men had completely vanished. Some  one suggested the gipsies, whereupon the Laird mounted the first horse  he came across and rode furiously to the huts of Derncleugh. Bursting in  a door, he found on the ruined hearth of the house that had once  sheltered Meg Merrilies, a fire still smouldering. But there, too,  Godfrey Bertram discovered nothing and no one.    While he remained on the spot, dazed and uncertain, looking at the  blackened hearthstone, his old servant entered hastily to bid him return  at once to Ellangowan. His wife had been taken dangerously ill. Godfrey  spurred as fast as horse would carry him, but Death had gone faster, and  had arrived before him. When he reached the gate, the Lady of Ellangowan  was dead, leaving him with a little baby girl less than an hour old. The  shock of Kennedy's murder and her own little Harry's loss had killed  her.        INTERLUDE OF INTERROGATION        The melancholy conclusion of the first _Guy      Mannering_ tale kept the children quieter than      usual. I think they regretted a little the gallant      opening of _Waverley_, but as ever they were full      of questions.        \"And all that happened here, in our Galloway?\"      began Sweetheart, looking about her at the hills of      dark heather and the sparkling Solway sands, from      which the storm-clouds were just beginning to lift.        \"Yes,\" I answered her, \"though it is doubtful if      Scott ever _was_ in Galloway. But he had seen      Criffel across from Dumfries-shire, and the castle      of Ellangowan is certainly described from the ruins      of Caerlaverock, opposite New Abbey. Besides, had      he not good old Joseph Train, the Castle Douglas      exciseman, to tell him everything--than whom no man      knew Galloway better?\"        \"Did gipsies really steal children?\" said Maid      Margaret, with some apprehension. She was somewhat      anxious, for an affirmative answer might interfere      with certain wide operations in blackberrying which      she was planning.        \"Sometimes they did,\" I answered, \"but not nearly      so often as they were blamed for. They had usually      enough mouths of their own to feed. So, unless they      were sure of a ransom, or perhaps occasionally for      the sake of revenge, gipsies very seldom were      guilty of kidnapping.\"        \"But they always do steal them in books,\" said Hugh      John; \"well, I would just like to see them cart me      off! And if they took Sir Toady Lion, they would      soon send him back. He eats so much!\"        This was Hugh John's idea of a joke, and somewhat      hastily I interrupted fraternal strife by returning      to the general subject.        \"Adam Smith, a very learned man, who afterwards      wrote _The Wealth of Nations_, was stolen by      gipsies when a child,\" I said.        \"_I_ wish they had just kept him,\" said Hugh John,      unexpectedly; \"then we wouldn't have had to      paraphrase the beastly thing at school. It is as      full of jaw-breakers as a perch is full of bones.\"        \"Was little Harry really stolen by gipsies, or was      he killed over the cliff?\" queried Maid Margaret.        \"Of course he was stolen, silly,\" broke in Sir      Toady Lion, sagely; \"look how much more of the book      there has got to be all about him. Think there      would be all that, if he got killed right at the      beginning, eh?\"        \"Do any people smuggle nowadays?\" demanded Hugh      John.        \"Of course they do--in Spain,\" interjected Sir      Toady Lion, \"father got put in prison there once.\"        \"That was all owing to a mistake,\" I explained      hastily (for really this had nothing to do with      Scott); \"it was only because your parent happened      to be wearing the same kind of hat as a certain      well-known smuggler, a very desperate character.\"        \"HUM-M!\" said Sir Toady Lion, suddenly developing a      cold in the nose.        \"Well, anyway, they do smuggle--though not much in      this country now,\" said Sweetheart, \"and I'm glad      father knew a man who smuggled in Spain. It makes      this book so much more real.\"        \"Getting put in prison instead of him made it      almost _too_ real,\" said Sir Toady. He is a most      disconcerting and ironical boy. One often wonders      where he gets it from.        So to shut off further questioning, I proceeded      immediately with the telling of the second tale      from _Guy Mannering_.          THE SECOND TALE FROM \"GUY MANNERING\"      I. HAPPY DOMINIE SAMPSON    IT was seventeen long years after the murder of Frank Kennedy and the  disappearance of little Harry Bertram when Guy Mannering, now a soldier  famous for his wars in the East, penetrated a second time into Galloway.  His object was to visit the family of Ellangowan, and secretly, also, to  find out for himself in what way his random prophesies had worked out.    But he arrived at an unfortunate time. He found that, chiefly by the  plotting and deceit of a rascally lawyer, one Gilbert Glossin, the  Bertrams were on the point of being sold out of Ellangowan. All their  money had been lost, and the sale of the estate was being forced on by  the rascally lawyer Glossin for his own ends.    The old man Godfrey Bertram also was very near his end. And indeed on  the very day of the sale, and while Mannering was paying his respects to  his former host, the sight of Glossin so enraged the feeble old man that  he was taken with a violent passion, falling back in his chair and dying  in a few minutes.    Mannering, whose heart was greatly touched, was most anxious to do all  that he could to assist Lucy Bertram, the old man's daughter, but he was  compelled by an urgent summons to return into England. It had been his  intention to save the estate of Ellangowan from the clutches of the  scoundrel Glossin by buying it himself, but the drunkenness of a postboy  whom he had sent with a letter to Mr. Mac-Morlan, the lawyer in charge  of the sale, defeated his intentions, so that Ellangowan became the  property of the traitor. So young Lucy Bertram and Dominie Sampson (who  refused to be separated from her) became for the moment inmates of Mr.  Mac-Morlan's house. The Dominie found a pupil or two in the  neighbourhood that he might not be chargeable to his dear Lucy or her  friend Mr. Mac-Morlan. And so, in the twenty-first year after the birth  of an heir, and after Mannering's prophecy concerning him, there seemed  an end to the ancient house of the Bertrams of Ellangowan.    During these years, Colonel Mannering also had a tale to tell. Wedded  early to the wife of his youth and his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22675"],[0,"Home Life in Colonial Days (#18)"],[1,"them, and to the end of her life it was the  morning duty of his wife \"to cut the sugar.\" I can see my old cousin  still in what she termed her breakfast room, dressed very handsomely,  standing before a bare mahogany table on which a maid placed the  considerable array of a silver salver without legs, which was set on a  folded cloth and held the sugar-loaf and the sugar-cutter; and another  salver with legs that bore various bowls and one beautiful silver  sugar-box which was kept filled high for her husband's toddy. It seemed  an interminably tedious work to me and a senseless one, as I chafingly  waited for the delightful morning drive in delightful Boston. It was in  this household that I encountered the sweetest thing of my whole life; I  have written elsewhere its praises in full; a barrel, a small one, to be  sure, but still a whole teak-wood barrel full of long strings of  glistening rock-candy. I had my fill of it at will, though it was not  kept as a sweetmeat, but was a kitchen store having a special use in  the manufacture of rich brandy sauces for plum puddings, and of a kind  of marchepane ornamentation for desserts.    All the spices used in the household were also ground at home, in  spice-mortars and spice-mills. These were of various sizes, including  the pepper-mills, which were set on the table at meal-times, and the  tiny ornamental graters which were carried in the pocket.    The entire food of a household was the possible production of a farm. In  a paper published in the American Museum in 1787 an old farmer says:--         \"At this time my farm gave me and my whole family a good living on       the produce of it, and left me one year with another one hundred       and fifty silver dollars, for I never spent more than ten dollars a       year which was for salt, nails, and the like. Nothing to eat, drink       or wear was bought, as my farm provided all.\"    The farm food was not varied, it is true, as to-day; for articles of  luxury came by importation. The products of tropical countries, such as  sugar, molasses, tea, coffee, spices, found poor substitutes in home  food-products. Dried pumpkin was a poor sweetening instead of molasses;  maple sugar and honey were not esteemed as was sugar; tea was  ill-replaced by raspberry leaves, loosestrife, hardhack, goldenrod,  dittany, blackberry leaves, yeopon, sage, and a score of other herbs;  coffee was better than parched rye and chestnuts; spices could not be  compensated for or remotely imitated by any substitutes.    So though there was ample quantity of food, the quality, save in the  town, was not such as English housewives had been accustomed to; there  were many deprivations in their kitchens which tried them sorely. The  better cooks they were, the more trying were the limitations. Every  woman with a love for her fellow-woman must feel a thrill of keen  sympathy for the goodwife of Newport, New Hampshire, who had to make her  Thanksgiving mince-pies with a filling of bear's meat and dried  pumpkins, sweetened with maple sugar, and her crust of corn-meal. Her  husband loyally recorded that they were the best mince-pies he ever ate.    As years passed on and great wealth came to individuals, the tables of  the opulent, especially in the Middle colonies, rivalled the luxury of  English and French houses of wealth. It is surprising to read in Dr.  Cutler's diary that when he dined with Colonel Duer in New York in 1787,  there were fifteen kinds of wine served besides cider, beer, and porter.    John Adams probably lived as well as any New Englander of similar  position and means. A Sunday dinner at his house was thus described by  a visitor: the first course was a pudding of Indian meal, molasses, and  butter; then came a course of veal and bacon, neck of mutton, and  vegetables. When the New Englander went to Philadelphia, his eyes opened  wide at the luxury and extravagance of fare. He has given in his diary  some accounts of the lavishness of the Philadelphia larder. Such entries  as these are found:--         (Of the home of Miers Fisher, a young Quaker lawyer.) \"This plain       Friend, with his plain but pretty wife with her Thees and Thous,       had provided us a costly entertainment; ducks, hams, chickens,       beef, pig, tarts, creams, custards, jellies, fools, trifles,       floating islands, beer, porter, punch, wine and a long, etc.\"         (At the home of Chief Justice Chew.) \"About four o'clock we were       called to dinner. Turtle and every other thing, flummery, jellies,       sweetmeats of twenty sorts, trifles, whipped sillabubs, floating       islands, fools, etc., with a dessert of fruits, raisins, almonds,       pears, peaches.\"         \"A most sinful feast again! everything which could delight the eye       or allure the taste; curds and creams, jellies, sweetmeats of       various sorts, twenty kinds of tarts, fools, trifles, floating       islands, whipped sillabubs, etc. Parmesan cheese, punch, wine,       porter, beer.\"    By which lists may plainly be seen that our second President had  somewhat of a sweet tooth.    The Dutch were great beer-drinkers and quickly established breweries at  Albany and New York. But before the century had ended New Englanders had  abandoned the constant drinking of ale and beer for cider. Cider was  very cheap; but a few shillings a barrel. It was supplied in large  amounts to students at college, and even very little children drank it.  President John Adams was an early and earnest wisher for temperance  reform; but to the end of his life he drank a large tankard of hard  cider every morning when he first got up. It was free in every farmhouse  to all travellers and tramps.    A cider-mill was usually built on a hillside so the building could be  one story high in front and two in the back. Thus carts could easily  unload the apples on the upper level and take away the barrels of cider  on the lower. Standing below on the lower floor you could see two  upright wooden cylinders, set a little way apart, with knobs, or nuts as  they were called, on one cylinder which fitted loosely into holes on the  other. The cylinders worked in opposite directions and drew in and  crushed the apples poured down between them. The nuts and holes  frequently clogged with the pomace. Then the mill was stopped and a boy  scraped out with a stick or hook the crushed apples. A horse walking in  a small circle moved a lever which turned the motor wheel. It was slow  work; it took three hours to grind a cart-load of apples; but the  machinery was efficient and simple. The pomace fell into a large shallow  vat or tank, and if it could lie in the vat overnight it was a benefit.  Then the pomace was put in a press. This was simple in construction. At  the bottom was a platform grooved in channels; a sheaf of clean straw  was spread on the platform, and with wooden shovels the pomace was  spread thick over it. Then a layer of straw was laid at right angles  with the first, and more pomace, and so on till the form was about three  feet high; the top board was put on as a cover; the screw turned and  blocks pressed down, usually with a long wooden hand-lever, very slowly  at first, then harder, until the mass was solid and every drop of juice  had trickled into the channels of the platform and thence to the pan  below. Within the last two or three years I have seen those cider-mills  at work in the country back of old Plymouth and in Narragansett, sending  afar their sourly fruity odors. And though apple orchards are running  out, and few new trees are planted, and the apple crop in those  districts is growing smaller and smaller, yet is the sweet cider of  country cider-mills as free and plentiful a gift to any passer-by as the  water from the well or the air we breathe. Perry was made from pears,  as cider is from apples, and peachy from peaches. Metheglin and mead,  drinks of the old Druids in England, were made from honey, yeast, and  water, and were popular everywhere. In Virginia whole plantations of the  honey-locust furnished locust beans for making metheglin. From  persimmons, elderberries, juniper berries, pumpkins, corn-stalks,  hickory nuts, sassafras bark, birch bark, and many other leaves, roots,  and barks, various light drinks were made. An old song boasted:--        \"Oh, we can make liquor to sweeten our lips      Of pumpkins, of parsnips, of walnut-tree chips.\"    Many other stronger and more intoxicating liquors were made in large  quantities, among them enormous amounts of rum, which was called often  \"kill-devil.\" The making of rum aided and almost supported the  slave-trade in this country. The poor negroes were bought on the coast  of Africa by New England sea-captains and merchants and paid for with  barrels of New England rum. These slaves were then carried on  slave-ships to the West Indies, and sold at a large profit to planters  and slave-dealers for a cargo of molasses. This was brought to New  England, distilled into rum, and sent off to Africa. Thus the circle of  molasses, rum, and slaves was completed. Many slaves were also landed  in New England, but there was no crop there that needed negroes to raise  it. So slavery never was as common in New England as in the South, where  the tropical tobacco and rice fields needed negro labor. But New  England's share in promoting negro slavery in America was just as great  as was Virginia's.    Besides all the rum that was sent to Africa, much was drunk by Americans  at home. At weddings, funerals, christenings, at all public meetings and  private feasts, New England rum was ever present. In nothing is more  contrast shown between our present day and colonial times than in the  habits of liquor-drinking. We cannot be grateful enough for the  temperance reform, which began at the early part of this century, and  was so sadly needed.    For many years the colonists had no tea, chocolate, or coffee to drink;  for those were not in "]]]
