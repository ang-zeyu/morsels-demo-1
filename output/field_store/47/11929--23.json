[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28764"],[0,"Getting Acquainted with the Trees (#18)"],[1," name I have never understood. The sycamore of the  Bible, referred to frequently in the Old Testament, traditionally  mentioned as the tree under which Joseph rested with Mary and the young  child on the way to Egypt, and into which Zaccheus climbed to see what  was going on, was a sort of fig tree--\"Pharaoh's Fig,\" in fact. When  the mystery-plays of the centuries gone by were produced in Europe, the  tree most like to what these good people thought was the real sycamore  furnished the branches used in the scene-setting--and it was either the  oriental plane, or the sycamore-leaved maple that was chosen, as  convenient. The name soon attached itself to the trees; and when  homesick immigrants looked about the new world of America for some  familiar tree, it was easy enough to see a great similarity in our  buttonwood, which thus soon became sycamore.    [Illustration: The sycamore, or button-ball]    So much for information, more or less legendary, I confess; but the  great tree we are discussing is very tangible. Indeed, it is always in  the public eye; for it carries on a sort of continuous disrobing  performance! The snake sheds his skin rather privately, and comes forth  in his new spring suit all at once; the oak and the maple, and all the  rest of them continually but invisibly add new bark between the  splitting or stretching ridges of the old; but our wholesome friend the  sycamore is quite shamelessly open about it, dropping off a plate or a  patch here and there as he grows and swells, to show us his underwear,  which thus at once becomes overcoat, as he goes on. At first greenish,  the under bark thus exposed becomes creamy white, mostly; and I have had  a conceit that the colder the winter, the whiter would be those portions  of Mr. Buttonball's pajamas he cared to expose to us the next spring!    [Illustration: Button-balls--fruit of the sycamore]    The leaves of the sycamore are good to look at, and efficient against  the sun. The color above is not as clear and sharp as that of the maple;  underneath the leaves are whitish, and soft, or \"pubescent,\" as the  botanical term goes. Quite rakishly pointed are the tips, and the whole  effect, in connection with the balls,--which are first crowded clusters  of flowers, and then just as crowded clusters of seeds--is that of a  gentleman of the old school, dignified in his knee-breeches and cocked  hat, fully aware that he is of comfortable importance!    Those little button-balls that give name to this good American tree  follow the flower clusters without much change of form--they _were_  flowers, they _are_ seeds--and they stay by the tree persistently all  winter, blowing about in the sharp winds. After a while one is banged  often enough to open its structure, and then the carrying wind takes on  its wings the neat little cone-shaped seeds, each possessed of its own  silky hairs to help float it gently toward the ground--and thus is  another of nature's curious rounds of distribution completed.    A tree is never without interest to those whose eyes have been opened to  some of the wonders and perfections of nature. Nevertheless, there is a  time in the year's round when each tree makes its special appeal. It may  be in the winter, when every twig is outlined sharply against the cold  sky, and the snow reflects light into the innermost crevices of its  structure, that the elm is most admirable. When the dogwood has on its  white robe in May and June, it then sings its song of the year. The  laden apple tree has a pure glory of the blossoms, and another warmer,  riper glory of the burden of fruit, but we think most kindly of its  flowering time. Some trees maintain such a continuous show of interest  and beauty that it is difficult to say on any day, \"_Now_ is this tulip  or this oak at its very finest!\" Again, the spring redness of the swamp  maple is hardly less vivid than its mature coloring of the fall.    But as to the liquidambar, or sweet-gum, there can be no question.  Interesting and elegant the year round, its autumn covering of polished  deep crimson starry leaves is so startlingly beautiful and distinct as  to almost take it out of comparison with any other tree. Others have  nearly the richness of color, others again show nearly the elegance of  leaf form, but no one tree rivals completely the sweet-gum at the time  when the autumn chill has driven out all the paleness in its leaf  spectrum, leaving only the warm crimson that seems for awhile to defy  further attacks of frost.    As to shape, the locality settles that; for, a very symmetrical small to  maximum-sized tree in the North and on high dry places, in the South  and in wet places north it becomes another \"tree of the first  magnitude,\" wide-spreading and heavy. A stellar comparison seems to fit,  because of these wonderful leaves. They struck me at first, hunting  photographs one day, as some sort of a maple; but what maple could have  such perfection of star form? A maple refined, perfected, and indeed  polished, one might well think, for while other trees have shining  leaves, they are dull in comparison with the deep-textured gloss of  these of the sweet-gum.    [Illustration: The liquidambar]    Here, too, is a tree for many places; an adaptable, cosmopolitan sort of  arboreal growth. At its full strength of hard, solid, time-defying  wooded body on the edge of some almost inaccessible swamp of the South,  where its spread-out roots and ridgy branches earn for it another common  name as the \"alligator tree,\" it is in a park or along a private  driveway at the North quite the acme of refined tree elegance, all the  summer and fall. It takes on a rather narrow, pyramidal head, broadening  as it ages, but never betraying kin with its fellow of the swamp, save  perhaps when winter has bared its peculiar winged and strangely \"corky\"  branches.    [Illustration: The star-shaped leaves and curious fruits of the  liquidambar, late in the summer.]    These odd branches bear, on some trees particularly, a noticeable ridge,  made up of the same substance which in the cork-oak of Europe furnishes  the bottle-stoppers of commerce. It makes the winter structure of the  sweet-gum most distinct and picturesque, which appearance is accentuated  by the interesting little seed-balls, or fruits, rounded and spiny, that  hang long from the twigs. These fruits follow quickly an inconspicuous  flower that in April or May has made its brief appearance, and they add  greatly to the general attractiveness of the tree on the lawn, to my  mind. Years ago I first made acquaintance with the liquidambar, as it  ought always to be called, one wet September day, when an old  tree-lover took me out on his lawn to see the rain accentuate the polish  on the starry leaves and drip from the little many-pointed balls. I  found that day that a camera would work quite well under an umbrella,  and I obtained also a mind-negative that will last, I believe, as long  as I can think of trees.    The next experience was in another state, where a quaint character,  visited on business, struck hands with me on tree-love, and took me to  see his pet liquidambar at the edge of a mill-pond. That one was taller,  and quite stately; it made an impression, deepened again when the third  special showing came, this time on a college campus, the young tree  being naked and corky, and displayed with pride by the college professor  who had gotten out of his books into real life for a joyous half day.    He wasn't the botany professor, if you please; that dry-as-dust  gentleman told me, when I inquired as to what I might find in early  bloom, or see with the eyes of an ignorant plant-lover, that there was  \"nothing blooming, and nothing of interest.\" He added that he had a  fine herbarium where I might see all the plants I wanted, nicely dried  and spread out with pins and pasters, their roots and all!    Look at _dead_ plants, their roots indecently exposed to mere curiosity,  on a bright, living early April day? Not much! I told my trouble to the  professor of agriculture, whose eyes brightened, as he informed me he  had no classes for that morning, and--\"We would see!\" We _did_ see a  whole host of living things outdoors,--flowers peeping out; leaves of  the willows, just breaking; buds ready to burst; all nature waiting for  the sun's call of the \"grand entree.\" It was a good day; but I pitied  that poor old dull-eyed herbarium specimen of a botanical professor, in  whose veins the blood was congealing, when everything about called on  him to get out under the rays of God's sun, and study, book in hand if  he wanted, the bursting, hurrying facts of the imminent spring.    But a word more about the liquidambar--the name by which I hope the tree  we are discussing may be talked of and thought of. Old Linnaeus gave it  that name, because it described euphoniously as well as scientifically  the fact that the sap which exudes from this fine American tree _is_  liquid amber. Now isn't that better than \"gum\" tree?    With trees in general as objects of interest, I have always felt a  special leaning toward tropical trees, probably because they were rare,  and indeed not to be seen outside of the conservatory in our Middle  States. My first visit to Florida was made particularly enjoyable by  reason of the palms and bananas there to be seen, and I have by no means  lost the feeling of admiration for the latter especially. In Yucatan  there were to be seen other and stranger growths and fruits, and the  novelty of a great cocoanut grove is yet a memory not eclipsed by the  present-day Floridian and Bahamian productions of the same sort.    It was, therefore, with some astonishment that I came to know, a few  years ago, more of a little tree bearing a fruit that had been familiar  from my boyhood, but which I was then informed was the sole northern  representative of a great family of tropical fruits, and which was  fairly called the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2882"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 4 (#18)"],[1,"on account of the census which he  took of the Israelites in defiance of the law in the Pentateuch.  When he was charged by the king with the task of numbering the  people, Joab used every effort to turn him away from his intention.  But in vain. Incensed, David said: \"Either thou art king and I am  the general, or I am king and thou art the general.\" Joab had no  choice but to obey. He selected the tribe of Gad as the first to be  counted, because he thought that the Gadites, independent and  self-willed, would hinder the execution of the royal order, and  David would be forced to give up his plan of taking a census. The  Gadites disappointed the expectations of Joab, and he betook  himself to the tribe of Dan, hoping that if God's punishment  descended, it would strike the idolatrous Danites. Disliking his  mission as he did, Joab spent nine months in executing it, though  he might have dispatched it in a much shorter time. Nor did he  carry out the king's orders to the letter. He himself warned the  people of the census. If he saw the father of a family of five sons,  he would bid him conceal a few of them. Following the example  set by Moses, he omitted the Levites from the enumeration,  likewise the tribe of Benjamin, because he entertained particularly  grave apprehensions in behalf of this greatly decimated tribe. (119)  In the end, David was not informed of the actual number obtained.  Joab made two lists, intending to give the king a partial list if he  found that he had no suspicion of the ruse. (120)    The prophet Gad came to David and gave him the choice of  famine, oppression by enemies, or the plague, as the penalty for  the heavy crime of popular census-taking. David was in the  position of a sick man who is asked whether he prefers to be  buried next to his father or next to his mother. The king  considered: \"If I choose the calamities of war, the people will say,  'He cares little, he has his warriors to look to.' If I choose famine,  they will say, 'He cares little, he has his riches to look to.' I shall  choose the plague, whose scourge strikes all alike.\" (121)  Although the plague raged but a very short time, (122) it claimed a  large number of victims. The most serious loss was the death of  Abishai, whose piety and learning made him the counterpoise of a  host of seventy-five thousand. (123)    David raised his eyes on high, and he saw the sins of Israel heaped  up from earth to heaven. In the same moment an angel descended,  and slew his four sons, the prophet Gad, and the elders who  accompanied him. David's terror at this sight, which was but  increased when the angel wiped his dripping sword on the king's  garments, settled in his limbs, and from that day on they never  ceased to tremble. (124)      THE DEATH OF DAVID    David once besought God to tell him when he would die. His  petition was not granted, for God has ordained that no man shall  foreknow his end. One thing, however, was revealed to David, that  his death would occur at the age of seventy on the Sabbath day.  David desired that he might be permitted to die on Friday. This  wish, too, was denied him, because God said that He delighted  more in one day passed by David in the study of the Torah, than in  a thousand holocausts offered by Solomon in the Temple. Then  David petitioned that life might be vouchsafed him until Sunday;  this, too, was refused, because God said it would be an  infringement of the rights of Solomon, for one reign may not  overlap by a hairbreadth the time assigned to another. Thereafter  David spent every Sabbath exclusively in the study of the Torah, in  order to secure himself against the Angel of Death, who has no  power to slay a man while he is occupied with the fulfillment of  God's commandments. The Angel of Death had to resort to  cunning to gain possession of David. (125) One Sabbath day,  which happened to be also the Pentecost holiday, (126) the king  was absorbed in study, when he heard a sound in the garden. He  rose and descended the stairway leading from his palace to the  garden, to discover the cause of the noise. No sooner had he set  foot on the steps than they tumbled in, and David was killed. The  Angel of Death had caused the noise in order to utilize the moment  when David should interrupt his study.  The king's corpse could  not be moved on the Sabbath, which was painful to those with  him, as it was lying exposed to the rays of the sun. So Solomon  summoned several eagles, and they stood guard over the body,  shading it with their outstretched pinions. (127)      DAVID IN PARADISE    The death of David did not mean the end of his glory and  grandeur. It merely caused a change of scene. In the heavenly  realm as on earth David ranks among the first. The crown upon his  head outshines all others, and whenever he moves out of Paradise  to present himself before God, suns, stars, angels, seraphim, and  other holy beings run to meet him. In the heavenly court-room a  throne of fire of gigantic dimensions is erected for him directly  opposite to the throne of God. Seated on this throne and  surrounded by the kings of the house of David and other Israelitish  kings, he intones wondrously beautiful psalms. At the end he  always cites the verse: \"The Lord reigns forever and ever,\" to  which the archangel Metatron and those with him reply: \"Holy,  holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts!\" This is the signal for the holy  Hayyot and heaven and earth to join in with praise. Finally the  kings of the house of David sing the verse: \"And the Lord shall be  king over all; in that day shall the Lord be one, and His name one.\"  (128)    The greatest distinction to be accorded David is reserved for the  judgment day, when God will prepare a great banquet in Paradise  for all the righteous. At David's petition, God Himself will be  present at the banquet, and will sit on His throne, opposite to  which David's throne will be placed. At the end of the banquet,  God will pass the wine cup over which grace is said, to Abraham,  with the words: \"Pronounce the blessing over the wine, thou who  art the father of the pious of the world.\" Abraham will reply: \"I am  not worthy to pronounce the blessing, for I am the father also of  the Ishmaelites, who kindle God's wrath.\" God will then turn to  Isaac: \"Say the blessing, for thou wert bound upon the altar as a  sacrifice.\" \"I am not worthy,\" he will reply, \"for the children of my  son Esau destroyed the Temple.\" Then to Jacob: \"Do thou speak  the blessing, thou whose children were blameless.\" Jacob also will  decline the honor on the ground that he was married to two sisters  at the same time, which later was strictly prohibited by the Torah.  God will then turn to Moses: \"Say the blessing, for thou didst  receive the law and didst fulfil its precepts.\" Moses will answer: \"I  am not worthy to do it, seeing that I was not found worthy to enter  the Holy Land.\" God will next offer the honor to Joshua, who both  led Israel into the Holy Land, and fulfilled the commandments of  the law. He, too, will refuse to pronounce the blessing, because he  was not found worthy to bring forth a son. Finally God will turn to  David with the words: \"Take the cup and say the blessing, thou the  sweetest singer in Israel and Israel's king. And David will reply:  'Yes, I will pronounce the blessing, for I am worthy of the honor.'\"  (129) Then God will take the Torah and read various passages  from it, and David will recite a psalm in which both the pious in  Paradise and the wicked in hell will join with a loud Amen.  Thereupon God will send his angels to lead the wicked from hell  to Paradise. (130)      THE FAMILY OF DAVID    David had six wives, including Michal, the daughter of Saul, who  is called by the pet name Eglah, \"Calfkin,\" in the list given in the  Bible narrative. (131) Michal was of entrancing beauty, (132) and  at the same time the model of a loving wife. Not only did she save  David out of the hands of her father, but also, when Saul, as her  father and her king, commanded her to marry another man, she  acquiesced only apparently. She entered into a mock marriage in  order not to arouse the anger of Saul, who had annulled her union  with David on grounds which he thought legal. Michal was good  as well as beautiful; she showed such extraordinary kindness to the  orphan children of her sister Merab that the Bible speaks of the  five sons of Michal \"whom she bore to Adriel.\" Adriel, however,  was her brother-in-law and not her husband, but she had raised his  children, treating them as though they were her own. (133) Michal  was no less a model of piety. Although the law exempted her, as a  woman, from the duty, still she executed the commandment of  using phylacteries. (134) In spite of all these virtues, she was  severely punished by God for her scorn of David, whom she  reproached with lack of dignity, when he had in mind only to do  honor to God. Long she remained childless, and at last, when she  was blessed with a child, she lost her own life in giving birth to it.  (135)    But the most important among the wives of David was Abigail, in  whom beauty, wisdom, and prophetical gifts were joined. With  Sarah, Rahab, and Esther, she forms the quartet of the most  beautiful women in history. She was so bewitching that passion  was aroused in men by the mere thought of her. (136) Her  cleverness showed itself during her first meeting with David,  when, though anxious about the life of her husband Nabal, she  still, with the utmost tranquility, put a ritual question to him in his  rage. He refused to answer it, because, he said, it was a question to  be investigated by day, not by night. Thereupon Abigail  interposed, that sentence of death likewise may be passed upon a  man only during the day. Even if David's judgment were right, the  law required him to wait until daybreak to execute it upon Nabal.  David's objection, that a rebel like Nabal had no"]]]
