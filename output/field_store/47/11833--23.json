Such  a record can injure no one; it may be of infinite service hereafter. I  could not justify myself to my conscience, or to those who have a  right to hold me responsible for my acts here, if I failed to do all  that lays in my power to have the true history of this Convention laid  before the country. A naked journal amounts to nothing. It is a  skeleton. Our discussions alone will give it form and comeliness. I  have prepared this resolution upon consultation with many members,  whose ideas of what should be done here agree with mine. They concur  with me in the propriety of offering it. If it fails, the  responsibility of keeping our discussions from the people will not  rest with us.    Mr. POLLOCK:--I move to lay the resolution on the table.    Mr. CHITTENDEN:--Let the vote be taken by States.    The vote was so taken, and the following States voted in the  affirmative: Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware,  Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Missouri, Virginia, and  Pennsylvania--11.    The following States voted in the negative: Maine, Vermont, New  Hampshire, Massachusetts, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and New York--8.    So the motion to lay on the table prevailed.    When the State of Ohio was called, a member of her delegation stated  that it was equally divided.    Mr. TUCK:--I ask the unanimous consent of the Conference to introduce  a proposition in the form of an address to the people of the United  States. I do so after having consulted a considerable number of  members; and having found that it meets their approval, I desire to  read it, and will then move that it be laid on the table and printed.    Mr. RANDOLPH:--Is the gentleman's motion in order?    Mr. EWING:--I object to the reading.    Mr. CLAY:--Certainly; I object also.    Mr. TUCK:--I will acquiesce with a single word. I certainly hoped no  curt objection would be made to the reading of _any_ proposition which  any member might deem it his duty to offer. As gentlemen differ from  me in this respect, I will hand the paper to the Chair. I hope at  least it may be permitted to lay on the table.    The PRESIDENT:--I hold it the gentleman's undoubted right to read the  paper if he chooses.    Mr. TUCK:--Very well.    He commenced reading when he was interrupted by    Mr. WICKLIFFE:--I hope Mr. TUCK will withdraw this paper. If the  Convention agrees to any result, I shall favor its submission to the  people with an address. I will pledge myself to suggest the  gentleman's name as one of a committee to prepare the address at the  proper time.    The PRESIDENT:--The gentleman from New Hampshire has the floor.    Mr. TUCK then completed the reading of the paper, as follows:         TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES:         This Convention of Conference, composed in part of       Commissioners appointed in accordance with the legislative       action of sundry States, and in part of Commissioners       appointed by the Governors of sundry other States, in       compliance with an invitation by the General Assembly of       Virginia, met in Washington on the 4th of February, 1861.       Although constituting a body unknown to the Constitution and       laws, yet being delegated for the purpose, and having       carefully considered the existing dangers and dissensions,       and having brought their proceedings to a close, publish       this address, and the accompanying resolutions, as the       result of their deliberations.         We recognize and deplore the divisions and distractions       which now afflict our country, interrupt its prosperity,       disturb its peace, and endanger the Union of the States; but       we repel the conclusion, that any alienations or dissensions       exist which are irreconcilable, which justify attempts at       revolution, or which the patriotism and fraternal sentiments       of the people, and the interests and honor of the whole       nation, will not overcome.         In a country embracing the central and most important       portion of a continent, among a people now numbering over       thirty millions, diversities of opinion inevitably exist;       and rivalries, intensified at times by local interests and       sectional attachments, must often occur; yet we do not doubt       that the theory of our Government is the best which is       possible for this nation, that the Union of the States is of       vital importance, and that the Constitution, which       expresses the combined wisdom of the illustrious founders of       the Government, is still the palladium of our liberties,       adequate to every emergency, and justly entitled to the       support of every good citizen.         It embraces, in its provisions and spirit, all the defence       and protection which any section of the country can       rightfully demand, or honorably concede.         Adopted with primary reference to the wants of five millions       of people, but with the wisest reference to future expansion       and development, it has carried us onward with a rapid       increase of numbers, an accumulation of wealth, and a degree       of happiness and general prosperity never attained by any       nation.         Whatever branch of industry, or whatever staple production,       shall become, in the possible changes of the future, the       leading interest of the country, thereby creating unforeseen       complications or new conflicts of opinion and interest, the       Constitution of the United States, properly understood and       fairly enforced, is equal to every exigency, a shield and       defence to all, in every time of need. If, however, by       reason of a change in circumstances, or for any cause, a       portion of the people believe they ought to have their       rights more exactly defined or more fully explained in the       Constitution, it is their duty, in accordance with its       provisions, to seek a remedy by way of amendment to that       instrument; and it is the duty of all the States to concur       in such amendments as may be found necessary to insure equal       and exact justice to all.         In order, therefore, to announce to the country the       sentiments of this Convention, respecting not only the       remedy which should be sought for existing discontents, but       also to communicate to the public what we believe to be the       patriotic sentiment of the country, we adopt the following       resolutions:         1st. _Resolved_, That this Convention recognize the       well-understood proposition that the Constitution of the       United States gives no power to Congress, or any branch of       the Federal Government, to interfere in any manner with       slavery in any of the States; and we are assured by abundant       testimony, that neither of the great political organizations       existing in the country contemplates a violation of the       spirit of the Constitution in this regard, or the procuring       of any amendment thereof, by which Congress, or any       department of the General Government, shall ever have       jurisdiction over slavery in any of the States.         2d. _Resolved_, That the Constitution was ordained and       established, as set forth in the preamble, by the people of       the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union,       establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for       the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure       the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity;       and when the people of any State are not in full enjoyment       of all the benefits intended to be secured to them by the       Constitution, or their rights under it are disregarded,       their tranquillity disturbed, their prosperity retarded, or       their liberty imperilled by the people of any State, full       and adequate redress can and ought to be provided for such       grievances.         3d. _Resolved_, That this Convention recommend to the       Legislatures of the States of the Union to follow the       example of the Legislatures of the States of Kentucky and of       Illinois, in applying to Congress to call a Convention for       the proposing of amendments to the Constitution of the       United States, pursuant to the fifth article thereof.    Mr. GUTHRIE:--I object to printing this paper. If that course is  taken, every member may offer his disquisitions on the Constitution,  and they will be printed at our expense.    Mr. TUCK:--Unanimous consent was given that it be read, laid on the  table, and printed.    The PRESIDENT:--There were three motions involved in one. Now the  question is upon laying the paper on the table and printing it.    Mr. ALEXANDER:--I call for a division of the question.    The PRESIDENT:--The question will be on the motion to lay it on the  table.    Mr. TUCK:--Are we not entitled to have the question taken on the  motion to print? I supposed all these questions would be taken in a  spirit of conciliation. But if not, I will withdraw the motion to lay  on the table, and move that the paper be printed.    Mr. MOREHEAD, of Kentucky:--I came here in a spirit of conciliation,  and I shall act in that spirit. Let us all do so. I disagree entirely  with Mr. TUCK and his proposition, but I am in favor of receiving  every proposition that is offered, of printing them all, and at the  proper time of considering them all. I trust that unanimous consent  will be given to printing this paper.    The PRESIDENT then put the motion upon printing the address, and it  was carried upon a division.    Mr. GUTHRIE offered the following resolution, which was adopted  unanimously:         _Resolved_, That if the President shall choose to speak on       any question, he may, for the occasion, call any member to       preside.

This  year, if prices rise, I shall be a Saiyyid.\"    ~Trading Castes.~--Aroras are the traders of the S.W. Panjab and of the  N.W.F. Province. They share the Central Panjab with the Khatris, who  predominate in the north-western districts. The Khatri of the  Rawalpindi division is often a landowner and a first-class fighting  man. Some of our strongest Indian civil officials have been Aroras. In  the Delhi division the place of the Arora and Khatri is taken by the  Bania, and in Kangra by the Sud or the Brahman. Khojas and Parachas are  Muhammadan traders.    ~Artizans and Menials.~--Among artizans and menials Sunars (goldsmiths),  Rajes (masons), Lohars (blacksmiths), and Tarkhans (carpenters) take the  first rank.    ~Impure Castes.~--The vast majority of the impure castes, the  \"untouchables\" of the Hindu religion, are scavengers and workers in  leather. The sweeper who embraces Islam becomes a Musalli. The Sikh  Mazhbis, who are the descendants of sweeper converts, have done  excellent service in our Pioneer regiments. The Hindu of the Panjab in  his avoidance of \"untouchables\" has never gone to the absurd lengths of  the high caste Madrasi, and the tendency is towards a relaxation of  existing restrictions.    ~Mendicants.~--Men of religion living on charity, wandering _fakirs_, are  common sights, and beggars are met with in the cities, who sometimes  exhibit their deformities with unnecessary insistence.    ~Kashmiris.~--According to the census return the number of Kashmiri  Musulmans, who make up 60 p.c. of the inhabitants of the Jhelam valley,  was 765,442. They are no doubt mostly descendants of various Hindu  castes, perhaps in the main of Hill Brahmans, but Islam has wiped out  all tribal distinctions. Sir Walter Lawrence wrote of them: \"The  Kashmiri is unchanged in spite of the splendid Moghal, the brutal  Afghan, and the bully Sikh. Warriors and statesmen came and went; but  there was no egress, and no wish ... in normal times to leave their  homes. The outside world was far, and from all accounts inferior to the  pleasant valley.... So the Kashmiris lived their self-centred life,  conceited, clever, and conservative.\"    The Hindu Kashmiri Pandits numbered 55,276.    ~Tribes of Jammu.~--Agricultural Brahmans are numerous in the Jammu  province. Thakkars and Meghs are important elements of the population of  the outer hills. The former are no doubt by origin Rajputs, but they  have cast off many Rajput customs. The Meghs are engaged in weaving and  agriculture, and are regarded as more or less impure by the higher  castes.    [Illustration: Fig. 32. Blind Beggar.]    ~Gujars.~--Gujars in the Maharaja's territories are almost always  graziers. In 1911 they numbered 328,003.    ~Dard Tribes of Astor and Gilgit.~--The people of Astor and Gilgit are  Dards speaking Shina and professing Islam. Sir Aurel Stein wrote of  them: \"The Dard race which inhabits the valleys N. of (the Inner  Himalaya) as far as the Hindu Kush is separated from the Kashmiri  population by language as well as by physical characteristics.... There  is little in the Dard to enlist the sympathies of the casual observer.  He lacks the intelligence, humour, and fine physique of the Kashmiri,  and, though undoubtedly far braver than the latter, has none of the  independent spirit and manly bearing which draw us towards the Pathan  despite all his failings. But I can never see a Dard without thinking of  the thousands of years of struggle they have carried on with the harsh  climate and the barren soil of their mountains[3].\"    [Illustration: Fig. 33. Dards.]    ~Kanjutis.~--The origin of the Kanjutis of Hunza is uncertain, and so are  the relationships of their language.    ~Mongoloid Population of Ladakh.~--The population of Ladakh and Baltistan  is Mongoloid, but the Baltis (72,439) have accepted Islam and polygamy,  while the Ladakhis have adhered to Buddhism and polyandry.    [Illustration: Fig. 34. Map showing races.]    ~Ethnological theories.~--In _The People of India_ the late Sir Herbert  Risley maintained that the inhabitants of Rajputana, nearly the whole of  the Panjab, and a large part of Kashmir, whatever their caste or social  status, belonged with few exceptions to a single racial type, which he  called Indo-Aryan. The Biluches of Dera Ghazi Khan and the Pathans of  the N.W.F. Province formed part of another group which he called  Turko-Iranian. The people of a strip of territory on the west of the  Jamna he held to be of the same type as the bulk of the inhabitants of  the United Provinces, and this type he called Aryo-Dravidian. Finally  the races occupying the hills in the north-east and the adjoining part  of Kashmir were of Mongol extraction, a fact which no one will dispute.  Of the Indo-Aryan type Sir Herbert Risley wrote: \"The stature is mostly  tall, complexion fair, eyes dark, hair on face plentiful, head long,  nose narrow and prominent, but not specially long.\" He believed that the  Panjab was occupied by Aryans, who came into the country from the west  or north-west with their wives and children, and had no need to contract  marriages with the earlier inhabitants. The Aryo-Dravidians of the  United Provinces resulted from a second invasion or invasions, in which  the Aryan warriors came alone and had to intermarry with the daughters  of the land, belonging to the race which forms the staple of the  population of Central India and Madras. This theory was based on  measurements of heads and noses, and it seems probable that deductions  drawn from these physical characters are of more value than any evidence  based on the use of a common speech. But it is hard to reconcile the  theory with the facts of history even in the imperfect shape in which  they have come down to us, or to believe that Sakas, Yuechi, and White  Huns (see historical section) have left no traces of their blood in the  province. If such there are, they may perhaps be found in some of the  tribes on both sides of the Salt Range, such as Gakkhars, Janjuas, Awans  Tiwanas, Ghebas, and Johdras, who are fine horsemen and expert  tent-peggers, not \"tall heavy men without any natural aptitude for  horsemanship,\" as Sir Herbert Risley described his typical Panjabi (p.  59 of his book).    [Illustration: Fig. 35. Map showing distribution of languages.]    ~Languages.~--In the area dealt with in this book no less than eleven  languages are spoken, and the dialects are very numerous. It is only  possible to tabulate the languages and indicate on the map the  localities in which they are spoken. For the Panjab the figures of the  recent census are:      A 1. Tibeto-Chinese                       41,607      B. Aryan:    (_a_) Iranian:   2. Pashtu                67,174                          3. Biluchi          70,675                          4. Kohistani            26      (_b_) Indian:    5. Kashmiri               7,190                          6. Pahari          993,363                          7. Lahndi        4,253,566                          8. Sindhi               24                          9. Panjabi      14,111,215                         10. Western Hindi 3,826,467                         11. Rajasthani      725,850    The eastern part of the Indus valley in Kashmir forming the provinces of  Ladakh and Baltistan is occupied by a Mongol population speaking  Tibeto-Chinese dialects. Kashmiri is the language of Kashmir Proper, and  various dialects of the Shina-Khowar group comprehensively described as  Kohistani are spoken in Astor, Gilgit, and Chilas, and to the west of  Kashmir territory in Chitral and the Kohistan or mountainous country at  the top of the Swat river valley. Though Kashmiri and the Shina-Khowar  tongues belong to the Aryan group, their basis is supposed to be  non-Sanskritic, and it is held that there is a strong non-Sanskritic or  Pisacha element also in Lahndi or western Panjabi, which is also the  prevailing speech in the Hazara and Dera Ismail Khan districts of the  N.W.F. Province, and is spoken in part of the Jammu province of Kashmir.  Pashtu is the common language in Peshawar, Kohat, and Bannu, and is  spoken on the western frontiers of Hazara and Dera Ismail Khan, and in  the independent tribal territory in the west between the districts of  the N.W.F. Province and the Durand Line and immediately adjoining the  Peshawar district on the north. Rajasthani is a collective name for the  dialects of Rajputana, which overflow into the Panjab, occupying a  strip along the southern frontier from Bahawalpur to Gurgaon. The  infiltration of English words and phrases into the languages of the  province is a useful process and as inevitable as was the enrichment of  the old English speech by Norman-French. But for the present the results  are apt to sound grotesque, when the traveller, who expects a train to  start at the appointed time, is told: \"_tren late hai, lekin singal down  hogaya_\" (the train is late, but the signal has been lowered), or the  criticism is passed on a popular officer: \"_bahut affable hai, lekin  hand shake nahin karta_\" (very affable, but doesn't shake hands).

Province an overwhelming  majority of the population professes Islam. In 1911 there were 2,039,994  Musalmans as compared with 119,942 Hindus, 30,345 Sikhs, and 6585  Christians.    ~Religions in Kashmir.~--In Kashmir the preponderance of Muhammadans is  not so overwhelming. The figures are:      Muhammadans     2,398,320    Hindus            690,390    Buddhists          36,512    Sikhs              31,553    The Hindus belong mostly to the Jammu province, where nearly half of the  population professes that faith.
