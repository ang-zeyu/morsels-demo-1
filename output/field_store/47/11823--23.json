Upon his answering in the negative, he said, 'Where is the  difference, then between this and the other, except that something  bigger than my cloak causes the eclipse?'\"    Another eclipse is mentioned by Thucydides[49] in connection with an  expedition of the Athenians against Cythera. He says:--\"At the very  commencement of the following summer there was an eclipse of the Sun at  the time of a new moon, and in the early part of the same month an  earthquake.\" This has been identified with the annular eclipse of March  21, 424 B.C., the central line of which passed across Northern Europe.  It is not quite clear whether the historian wishes to insinuate that the  eclipse caused the earthquake or the earthquake the eclipse.    An eclipse known as that of Ennius is another of the eclipses antecedent  to the Christian Era which has been the subject of full modern  investigation, and the circumstances of which are such that, in the  language of Professor Hansen, \"it may be reckoned as one of the most  certain and well-established eclipses of antiquity.\" The record of it  has only been brought to light in modern times by the discovery of  Cicero's Treatise, _De Republica_. According to Cicero,[50] Ennius the  great Roman poet, who lived in the second century B.C., and who died of  gout contracted, it is said, by frequent intoxication, recorded an  interesting event in the following words:--_Nonis Junii soli luna  obstetit et nox_, \"On the Nones of June the Moon was in opposition to  the Sun and night.\" This singular phrase has long been assumed to allude  to an eclipse of the Sun, but the precise interpretation of the words  was not for a long time realised. In Cicero's time the Nones of June  fell on the 5th, but in the time of Ennius, who lived a century and a  half before Cicero, the Nones of June fell between June 5 and July 4 on  account of the lunar years and the intercalary month of the Roman  Calendar. The date of this eclipse is distinctly known to be June 21,  400 B.C., but the hour was long in dispute. Professor Zech found that  the Sun set at Rome eclipsed, and that the maximum phase took place  after sun-set. Hansen, however, with his better Tables, found that the  eclipse was total at Rome, and that the totality ended at 7.33 p.m., the  Sun setting almost immediately afterwards at 7.36. This fact, Hansen  considers, explains the otherwise unintelligible passage of Ennius  quoted above: instead of saying _et nox_, he should have said _et simul  nox_, \"and immediately it was night.\" Newcomb questions the totality of  this eclipse, but assigns no clear reasons for his doubts.[51]    On August 14, 394 B.C., there was a large eclipse of the Sun visible in  the Mediterranean. It occurred in the forenoon, and is mentioned by  Xenophon[52] in connection with a naval engagement in which the Persians  were defeated by Conon.    Plutarch, in his _Life of Pelopidas_, relates how one, Alexander of  Pherae, had devastated several cities of Thessaly, and that as soon as  the oppressed inhabitants had learned that Pelopidas had come back from  an embassy on which he had been to the King of Persia, they sent  deputies to him to Thebes to beg the favour of armed assistance, with  Pelopidas as general. \"The Thebans willingly granted their request, and  an army was soon got ready, but as the general was on the point of  marching, the Sun began to be eclipsed, and the city was covered with  darkness in the day-time.\" This eclipse is generally identified with  that of July 13, 364 B.C. If this is correct, Plutarch's language must  be incorrect, or at least greatly exaggerated, for no more than about  three-fourths of the Sun was obscured.    On February 29, 357 B.C., there happened an eclipse, also visible in or  near the Mediterranean. This is supposed to have been the eclipse for  the prediction of which Helicon, a friend of Plato, received from  Dionysius, King of Syracuse, payment in the shape of a talent.    We have now to consider another ancient eclipse which has a history of  peculiar interest as regards the investigations to which it has been  subjected. It is commonly known as the \"Eclipse of Agathocles,\" and is  recorded by two historians of antiquity in the words following. Diodorus  Siculus[53] says:--    \"Agathocles also, though closely pursued by the enemy, by the advantage  of the night coming on (beyond all hope), got safe off from them. The  next day there was such an eclipse of the Sun, that the stars appeared  everywhere in the firmament, and the day was turned into night, upon  which Agathocles's soldiers (conceiving that God thereby did foretell  their destruction) fell into great perplexities and discontents  concerning what was like to befall them.\"    Justin says[54]:--    \"By the harangue the hearts of the soldiers were somewhat elevated, but  an eclipse of the Sun that had happened during their voyage still  possessed them with superstitious fears of a bad omen. The king was at  no less pain to satisfy them about this affair than about the war, and  therefore he told them that he should have thought this sign an ill  presage for them, if it had happened before they set out, but having  happened afterwards he could not but think it presaged ill to those  against whom they marched. Besides, eclipses of the luminaries always  signify a change of affairs, and therefore some change was certainly  signified, either to Carthage, which was in such a flourishing  condition, or to them whose affairs were in a very ruinous state.\"    The substance of these statements is that in the year 310 B.C.  Agathocles, Tyrant of Syracuse, while conducting his fleet from Syracuse  to the Coast of Africa, found himself enveloped in the shadow of an  eclipse, which evidently, from the accounts, was total. His fleet had  been chased by the Carthaginians on leaving Syracuse the preceding day,  but got away under the cover of night. On the following morning about 8  or 9 a.m. a sudden darkness came on which greatly alarmed the sailors.  So considerable was the darkness, that numerous stars appeared. It is  not at the first easy to localise the position of the fleet, except that  we may infer that it could hardly have got more than 80 or at the most  100 miles away from the harbour of Syracuse where it had been closely  blockaded by a Carthaginian fleet. Agathocles would not have got away at  all but for the fact that a relieving fleet was expected, and the  Carthaginians were obliged to relax their blockade in order to go in  search of the relieving fleet. Thus it came about not only that  Agathocles set himself free, but was able to retaliate on his enemies by  landing on the coast of Africa at a point near the modern Cape Bon, and  devastating the Carthaginian territories. The voyage thither occupied  six days, and the eclipse occurred on the second day. Though we are not  informed of the route followed by Agathocles, that is to say whether he  passed round the North or the South side of the island of Sicily, yet it  has been made clear by astronomers that the southern side was that  taken.    Baily, who was the first modern astronomer to investigate the  circumstances of this eclipse, found that there was an irreconcilable  difference between the path of the shadow found by himself and the  historical statement, a gap of about 180 geographical miles seeming to  intervene between the most southerly position which could be assigned to  the fleet of Agathocles, and the most northerly possible limit of the  path of the eclipse shadow. This was the condition of the problem when  Sir G. B. Airy took it up in 1853.[55] He, however, was able to throw an  entirely new light upon the matter. The tables used by Baily were  distinctly inferior to those now in use, and Sir G. B. Airy thought  himself justified in saying that to obviate the discordance of 180 miles  just referred to \"it is only necessary to suppose an error of 3' in the  computed distances of the Sun and Moon at conjunction, a very  inconsiderable correction for a date anterior to the epoch of the tables  by more than twenty-one centuries.\"    It deserves to be mentioned, though the point cannot here be dwelt upon  at much length, that these ancient eclipses all hang together in such a  way that it is not sufficient for the man of Astronomy and the man of  Chronology to agree on one eclipse, unless they can harmonise the facts  of several.    For instance, the eclipse of Thales, the date of which was long and much  disputed, has a material bearing on the eclipse of Agathocles, the date  of which admits of no dispute; and one of the problems which had to be  solved half a century ago was how best to use the eclipse of Agathocles  to determine the date of that of Thales. If 610 B.C. were accepted for  the Thales eclipse, so as to throw the zone of total darkness anywhere  over Asia Minor (where for the sake of history it was essential to put  it) the consequence would be that the shadow of the eclipse of 310 B.C.  would have been thrown so far on to land, in Africa, as to make it out  of the question for Agathocles and his fleet to have been in it, yet we  know for a certainty that he was in it in that year, and no other year.  Conversely, if 603 B.C. were accepted for the Thales eclipse, then to  raise northwards the position of the shadow in that year from the line  of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, that it might pass through Asia  Minor, would so raise the position of the shadow in 310 B.C. as to throw  it far too much to the N. of Sicily for Agathocles, who we know must  have gone southwards to Africa, to have entered it. But if we assume 585  B.C. as the date of the eclipse of Thales, we obtain a perfect  reconciliation of everything that needs to be reconciled; the shadow of  the eclipse of 585 B.C. will be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24236"],[0,"Time and Tide: A Romance of the Moon (#18)"],[1," the earth and the sun are  placed side by side for comparison. There is then the retinue of  planets, among the smaller of which our earth takes its place, a view  of the comparative sizes of the planets being shown in Fig. 5.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.--Comparative sizes of Earth and Sun.]    Not to embarrass ourselves with the perplexities of a problem so  complicated as our solar system is in its entirety, we shall for the  sake of clear reasoning assume an ideal system, consisting of a sun  and a large planet--in fact, such as our own system would be if we  could withdraw from it all other bodies, leaving the sun and Jupiter  only remaining. We shall suppose, of course, that the sun is much  larger than the planet, in fact, it will be convenient to keep in mind  the relative masses of the sun and Jupiter, the weight of the planet  being less than one-thousandth part of the sun. We know, of course,  that both of those bodies are rotating upon their axes, and the one  is revolving around the other; and for simplicity we may further  suppose that the axes of rotation are perpendicular to the plane of  revolution. In bodies so constituted tides will be manifested.  Jupiter will raise tides in the sun, the sun will raise tides in  Jupiter. If the rotation of each body be performed in a less period  than that of the revolution (the case which alone concerns us), then  the tides will immediately operate in their habitual manner as a brake  for the checking of rotation. The tides raised by the sun on Jupiter  will tend therefore to lengthen Jupiter's day; the tides raised on the  sun by Jupiter will tend to augment the sun's period of rotation. Both  Jupiter and the sun will therefore lose some moment of momentum. We  cannot, however, repeat too often the dynamical truth that the total  moment of momentum must remain constant, therefore what is lost by the  rotation must be made up in the revolution; the orbit of Jupiter  around the sun must accordingly be swelling. So far the reasoning  appears similar to that which led to such startling consequences in  regard to the moon.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Comparative sizes of Planets.]    But now for the fundamental difference between the two cases. The  moon, it will be remembered, always revolves with the same face  towards the earth. The tides have ceased to operate there, and  consequently the moon is not able to contribute any moment of  momentum, to be applied to the enlargement of its distance from the  earth; all the moment of momentum necessary for this purpose is of  course drawn from the single supply in the rotation of the earth on  its axis. But in the case of the system consisting of the sun and  Jupiter the circumstances are quite different--Jupiter does not always  bend the same face to the sun; so far, indeed, is this from being  true, that Jupiter is eminently remarkable for the rapidity of his  rotation, and for the incessantly varying aspect in which he would be  seen from the sun. Jupiter has therefore a store of available moment  of momentum, as has also of course the sun. Thus in the sun and planet  system we have in the rotations two available stores of moment of  momentum on which the tides can make draughts for application to the  enlargement of the revolution. The proportions in which these two  available sources can be drawn upon for contributions is not left  arbitrary. The laws of dynamics provide the shares in which each of  the bodies is to contribute for the joint purpose of driving them  further apart.    Let us see if we cannot form an estimate by elementary considerations  as to the division of the labour. The tides raised on Jupiter by the  sun will be practically proportional to the sun's mass and to the  radius of Jupiter. Owing to the enormous size of the sun, the  efficiency of these tides and the moment of the friction-brake they  produce will be far greater on the planet than will the converse  operation of the planet be on the sun. Hence it follows that the  efficiency of the tides in depriving Jupiter of moment of momentum  will be greatly superior to the efficiency of the tides in depriving  the sun of moment of momentum. Without following the matter into any  close numerical calculation, we may assert that for every one part the  sun contributes to the common object, Jupiter will contribute at least  a thousand parts; and this inequality appears all the more striking,  not to say unjust, when it is remembered that the sun is more  abundantly provided with moment of momentum than is Jupiter--the sun  has, in fact, about twenty thousand times as much.    The case may be illustrated by supposing that a rich man and a poor  man combine together to achieve some common purpose to which both are  to contribute. The ethical notion that Dives shall contribute  largely, according to his large means, and Lazarus according to his  slender means, is quite antagonistic to the scale which dynamics has  imposed. Dynamics declares that the rich man need only give a penny to  every pound that has to be extorted from the poor man. Now this is  precisely the case with regard to the sun and Jupiter, and it involves  a somewhat curious consequence. As long as Jupiter possesses available  moment of momentum, we may be certain that no large contribution of  moment of momentum has been obtained from the sun. For, returning to  our illustration, if we find that Lazarus still has something left in  his pocket, we are of course assured that Dives cannot have expended  much, because, as Lazarus had but little to begin with, and as Dives  only puts in a penny for every pound that Lazarus spends, it is  obvious that no large amount can have been devoted to the common  object. Hence it follows that whatever transfer of moment of momentum  has taken place in the sun-Jupiter system has been almost entirely  obtained at the expense of Jupiter. Now in the solar system at  present, the orbital moment of momentum of Jupiter is nearly fifty  thousand times as great as his present store of rotational moment of  momentum. If, therefore, the departure of Jupiter from the sun had  been the consequence of tidal evolution, it would follow that Jupiter  must once have contained many thousands of times the moment of  momentum that he has at present. This seems utterly incredible, for  even were Jupiter dilated into an enormously large mass of vaporous  matter, spinning round with the utmost conceivable speed, it is  impossible that he should ever have possessed enough moment of  momentum. We are therefore forced to the conclusion that the tides  alone do not provide sufficient explanation for the retreat of Jupiter  from the sun.    There is rather a subtle point in the considerations now brought  forward, on which it will be necessary for us to ponder. In the  illustration of Dives and Lazarus, the contributions of Lazarus of  course ceased when his pockets were exhausted, but those of Dives will  continue, and in the lapse of time may attain any amount within the  utmost limits of Dives' resources. The essential point to notice is,  that so long as Lazarus retains anything in _his_ pocket, we know for  certain that Dives has not given much; if Lazarus, however, has his  pocket absolutely empty, and if we do not know how long they may have  been in that condition, we have no means of knowing how large a  portion of wealth Dives may not have actually expended. The  turning-point of the theory thus involves the fact that Jupiter still  retains available moment of momentum in his rotation; and this was our  sole method of proving that the sun, which in this case was Dives, had  never given much. But our argument must have taken an entirely  different line had it so happened that Jupiter constantly turned the  same face to the sun, and that therefore his pockets were entirely  empty in so far as available moment of momentum is concerned. It would  be apparently impossible for us to say to what extent the resources of  the sun may not have been drawn upon; we can, however, calculate  whether in any case the sun could possibly have supplied enough moment  of momentum to account for the recession of Jupiter. Speaking in round  numbers, the revolutional moment of momentum of Jupiter is about  thirty times as great as the rotational moment of momentum at present  possessed by the sun. I do not know that there is anything impossible  in the supposition that the sun might, by an augmented volume and an  augmented velocity of rotation, contain many times the moment of  momentum that it has at this moment. It therefore follows that if it  had happened that Jupiter constantly bent the same face to the sun,  there would apparently be nothing impossible in the fact that Jupiter  had been born of the sun, just as the moon was born of the earth.  These same considerations should also lead us to observe with still  more special attention the development of the earth-moon system. Let  us restate the matter of the earth and moon in the light which the  argument with respect to Jupiter has given us. At present the  rotational moment of momentum of the earth is about a fifth part of  the revolutional moment of momentum of the moon. Owing to the fact  that the moon keeps the same face to us, she has now no available  moment of momentum, and all the moment of momentum required to account  for her retreat has of late come from the rotation of the earth; but  suppose that the moon still had some liquid on its surface which could  be agitated by tides, suppose further that it did not always bend the  same face towards us, that it therefore had some available moment of  momentum due to its rotation on which the tides could operate, then  see how the argument would have been altered. The gradual increase of  the moon's distance could be provided for by a transfer of moment of  momentum from two sources, due of course to the rotational velocities  of the two bodies.
