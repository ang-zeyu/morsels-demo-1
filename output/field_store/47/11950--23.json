[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3050"],[0,"Notes of a War Correspondent (#18)"],[1,"every one is pushing and struggling, and the air palpitates with the  intoxication of a great event, the winning of a horse-race--here, where  men are killed every hour and no one of them knows when his turn may  come, the fact that most impresses you is their indifference to it all.  What strikes you most is the bored air of the Tommies, the undivided  interest of the engineers in the construction of a pontoon bridge, the  solicitude of the medical staff over the long lines of wounded, the rage  of the naked Kaffirs at their lumbering steers; the fact that every one  is intent on something--anything--but the battle.    They are wearied with battles.  The Tommies stretch themselves in the sun  to dry the wet khaki in which they have lain out in the cold night for  weeks, and yawn at battles.  Or, if you climb to the hill where the  officers are seated, you will find men steeped even deeper in boredom.  They are burned a dark red; their brown mustaches look white by contrast,  theirs are the same faces you have met with in Piccadilly, which you see  across the tables of the Savoy restaurant, which gaze depressedly from  the windows of White's and the Bachelors' Club.  If they were bored then,  they are unbearably bored now.  Below them the men of their regiment lie  crouched amid the bowlders, hardly distinguishable from the brown and  yellow rock.  They are sleeping, or dozing, or yawning.  A shell passes  over them like the shaking of many telegraph wires, and neither officer  nor Tommy raises his head to watch it strike.  They are tired in body and  in mind, with cramped limbs and aching eyes.  They have had twelve nights  and twelve days of battle, and it has lost its power to amuse.    When the sergeants call the companies together, they are eager enough.  Anything is better than lying still looking up at the sunny, inscrutable  hills, or down into the plain crawling with black oxen.    Among the group of staff officers some one has lost a cigar-holder.  It  has slipped from between his fingers, and, with the vindictiveness of  inanimate things, has slid and jumped under a pile of rocks.  The  interest of all around is instantly centred on the lost cigar-holder.  The Tommies begin to roll the rocks away, endangering the limbs of the  men below them, and half the kopje is obliterated.  They are as keen as  terriers after a rat.  The officers sit above and give advice and  disagree as to where that cigar-holder hid itself.  Over their heads, not  twenty feet above, the shells chase each other fiercely.  But the  officers have become accustomed to shells; a search for a lost  cigar-holder, which is going on under their very eyes, is of greater  interest.  And when at last a Tommy pounces upon it with a laugh of  triumph, the officers look their disappointment, and, with a sigh of  resignation, pick up their field-glasses.    It is all a question of familiarity.  On Broadway, if a building is going  up where there is a chance of a loose brick falling on some one's head,  the contractor puts up red signs marked \"Danger!\" and you dodge over to  the other side.  But if you had been in battle for twelve days, as have  the soldiers of Buller's column, passing shells would interest you no  more than do passing cable-cars.  After twelve days you would forget that  shells are dangerous even as you forget when crossing Broadway that  cable-cars can kill and mangle.    Up on the highest hill, seated among the highest rocks, are General  Buller and his staff.  The hill is all of rocks, sharp, brown rocks, as  clearly cut as foundation-stones.  They are thrown about at irregular  angles, and are shaded only by stiff bayonet-like cacti.  Above is a blue  glaring sky, into which the top of the kopje seems to reach, and to draw  and concentrate upon itself all of the sun's heat.  This little jagged  point of blistering rocks holds the forces that press the button which  sets the struggling mass below, and the thousands of men upon the  surrounding hills, in motion.  It is the conning tower of the relief  column, only, unlike a conning tower, it offers no protection, no  seclusion, no peace.  To-day, commanding generals, under the new  conditions which this war has developed, do not charge up hills waving  flashing swords.  They sit on rocks, and wink out their orders by a  flashing hand-mirror.  The swords have been left at the base, or coated  deep with mud, so that they shall not flash, and with this column every  one, under the rank of general, carries a rifle on purpose to disguise  the fact that he is entitled to carry a sword.  The kopje is the central  station of the system.  From its uncomfortable eminence the commanding  general watches the developments of his attack, and directs it by  heliograph and ragged bits of bunting.  A sweating, dirty Tommy turns his  back on a hill a mile away and slaps the air with his signal flag;  another Tommy, with the front visor of his helmet cocked over the back of  his neck, watches an answering bit of bunting through a glass.  The bit  of bunting, a mile away, flashes impatiently, once to the right and once  to the left, and the Tommy with the glass says, \"They understand, sir,\"  and the other Tommy, who has not as yet cast even an interested glance at  the regiment he has ordered into action, folds his flag and curls up  against a hot rock and instantly sleeps.    Stuck on the crest, twenty feet from where General Buller is seated, are  two iron rods, like those in the putting-green of a golf course.  They  mark the line of direction which a shell must take, in order to seek out  the enemy.  Back of the kopje, where they cannot see the enemy, where  they cannot even see the hill upon which he is intrenched, are the  howitzers.  Their duty is to aim at the iron rods, and vary their aim to  either side of them as they are directed to do by an officer on the  crest.  Their shells pass a few yards over the heads of the staff, but  the staff has confidence.  Those three yards are as safe a margin as a  hundred.  Their confidence is that of the lady in spangles at a  music-hall, who permits her husband in buckskin to shoot apples from the  top of her head.  From the other direction come the shells of the Boers,  seeking out the hidden howitzers.  They pass somewhat higher, crashing  into the base of the kopje, sometimes killing, sometimes digging their  own ignominious graves.  The staff regard them with the same  indifference.  One of them tears the overcoat upon which Colonel  Stuart-Wortley is seated, another destroys his diary.  His men, lying at  his feet among the red rocks, observe this with wide eyes.  But he does  not shift his position.  His answer is, that his men cannot shift theirs.    On Friday, February 23d, the Inniskillings, Dublins, and Connaughts were  sent out to take a trench, half-way up Railway Hill.  The attack was one  of those frontal attacks, which in this war, against the new weapons,  have added so much to the lists of killed and wounded and to the prestige  of the men, while it has, in an inverse ratio, hurt the prestige of the  men by whom the attack was ordered.  The result of this attack was  peculiarly disastrous.  It was made at night, and as soon as it  developed, the Boers retreated to the trenches on the crest of the hill,  and threw men around the sides to bring a cross-fire to bear on the  Englishmen.  In the morning the Inniskillings found they had lost four  hundred men, and ten out of their fifteen officers.  The other regiments  lost as heavily.  The following Tuesday, which was the anniversary of  Majuba Hill, three brigades, instead of a regiment, were told off to take  this same Railway Hill, or Pieter's, as it was later called, on the  flank, and with it to capture two others.  On the same day, nineteen  years before, the English had lost Majuba Hill, and their hope was to  take these three from the Boers for the one they had lost, and open the  way to Bulwana Mountain, which was the last bar that held them back from  Ladysmith.    The first two of the three hills they wanted were shoulder to shoulder,  the third was separated from them by a deep ravine.  This last was the  highest, and in order that the attack should be successful, it was  necessary to seize it first.  The hills stretched for three miles; they  were about one thousand two hundred yards high.    For three hours a single line of men slipped and stumbled forward along  the muddy bank of the river, and for three hours the artillery crashed,  spluttered, and stabbed at the three hills above them, scattering the  rocks and bursting over and behind the Boer trenches on the crest.    As is their custom, the Boers remained invisible and made no reply.  And  though we knew they were there, it seemed inconceivable that anything  human could live under such a bombardment of shot, bullets, and shrapnel.  A hundred yards distant, on our right, the navy guns were firing lyddite  that burst with a thick yellow smoke; on the other side Colt automatics  were put-put-put-ing a stream of bullets; the field-guns and the  howitzers were playing from a hill half a mile behind us, and scattered  among the rocks about us, and for two miles on either hand, the infantry  in reserve were firing off ammunition at any part of the three hills they  happened to dislike!    The roar of the navy's Four-Point-Sevens, their crash, their rush as they  passed, the shrill whine of the shrapnel, the barking of the howitzers,  and the mechanical, regular rattle of the quick-firing Maxims, which  sounded like the clicking of many mowing-machines on a hot summer's day,  tore the air with such hideous noises that one's skull ached from the  concussion, and one could only be heard by shouting.  But more impressive  by far than this hot chorus of mighty thunder and petty hammering, was  the roar of the wind which was driven down into the valley beneath, and  which swept up again in enormous waves of sound.

The four front teeth in each jaw are called _in-ci'sors_,  (cutting teeth;) the next tooth in each side, the _cus'pid_, (eye  tooth;) the next two, _bi-cus'pids_, (small grinders;) the next two,  _mo'lars_, (grinders.) The last one on each side of the jaw is called  a _wisdom tooth_, because it does not appear until a person is about  twenty years old. The incisors, cuspids, and bicuspids, have each but  one root. The molars of the upper jaw have three roots, while those of  the lower jaw have but two.    [Illustration: Fig. 55.

Those animals  that feed exclusively on flesh, as the lion, have the cuspids, or  canine teeth, largely developed, and the molars have sharp cutting  points. Those animals that feed on grass and grain, as the horse and  the sheep, have their molar teeth more rounded and flat on the crown.  The human teeth are adapted to feed on fruits, grain, or flesh, as  they are less pointed than those of the cat, and more pointed than  those of the sheep.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    216.

What is said of the shape of the teeth in different  species of animals?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    217. The teeth are composed principally of two substances--the  _i'vo-ry_ and the _en-am'el_. The internal part of the tooth or the  ivory, is harder and more enduring than bone, and forms the body of  the tooth. The enamel is remarkable for its hardness, and varies  somewhat in color with the age, temperament, habits, and manner of  living of different individuals. When any part of the enamel is  destroyed, it is never regenerated.    [Illustration: Fig. 56. A side view of the body and enamel of a front  tooth.]    [Illustration: Fig. 57. A side view of a molar tooth. 1, The enamel. 2,  The body of the tooth. 3, The cavity in the crown of the tooth that  contains the pulp. 4, A nerve that spreads in the pulp of the tooth. 5,  An artery that ramifies in the pulp of the tooth.]    218. Each tooth is divided into two parts, namely, _crown_ and _root_.  The crown is that part which protrudes from the jaw-bone and gum, and  is covered by the highly polished enamel. The root, or \"fang,\" is  placed in the sockets of the jaw, and consists of bony matter. Through  this bony substance several small vessels pass, to aid in the growth  and also in the removal of the tooth. There are, beside these  vessels, small white cords passing to each tooth, called _nerves_.  (See fig. 57.) When these nerves are diseased, we have the toothache.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    217. Give the structure of the teeth. What is said of the enamel? 218.  Into how many parts are the teeth divided? Describe the crown. The  root. What vessels pass through the bony matter? What is their use?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=      PHYSIOLOGY OF THE TEETH.    219. The use of the teeth is twofold. 1st. By the action of the  incisors the food is divided, while the molars grind or break down the  more solid portions of it. By these processes, the food is prepared to  pass more easily and rapidly into the stomach.    220. In the mastication of food there are two movements of the lower  jaw--the action by which the teeth are brought together, and the  lateral motion. In the former, the food is cut or divided, the jaws  acting like shears. This movement is produced by the action of two  large muscles situated on each side of the head and face.    _Observation._ The muscles attached to the lower jaw are of great  strength; by their action alone, some persons are enabled to bite the  hardest substances. By putting the fingers upon the side of the head  above and in front of the ears, and upon the face above the angle of  the jaw, while masticating food, the alternate swelling and relaxation  of these muscles will be clearly felt.    221. The lateral, or grinding movement of the teeth, is produced by  the action of a strong muscle that is attached to the lower jaw on the  inside.    _Observation._ Those animals that live solely on flesh, have only the  cutting, or shear-like movement of the jaws. Those that use  vegetables for food, have the grinding motion; while man has both the  cutting and grinding movement.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    219-222. _Give the physiology of the teeth._ 219. Give one of the  functions of the teeth. 220. How many movements of the lower jaw in  masticating food? What effect has the first movement upon the food?  How produced? What is the character of the masticating muscles? 221.  How is the grinding motion of the teeth produced? What is said of the  movements of the teeth in different animals?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    222. 2d. The teeth aid us in articulating with distinctness certain  letters and words. An individual who has lost his front teeth cannot  enunciate distinctly certain letters called dental. Again, as the  alveolar processes are removed by absorption soon after the removal of  the teeth, the lips and cheeks do not retain their former full  position, thus marring, in no slight degree, the symmetry of the lower  part of the face. Consequently, those simple observances that tend to  the preservation of the teeth are of great practical interest to all  persons.      HYGIENE OF THE TEETH.    223. _To preserve the teeth, they must be kept clean._ After eating  food, they should be cleansed with a brush and water, or rubbed with a  piece of soft flannel, to prevent the _tartar_ collecting, and to  remove the pieces of food that may have lodged between them.  Toothpicks may be useful in removing any particles inaccessible to the  brush. They may be made of bone, ivory, or the common goose-quill.  Metallic toothpicks should not be used, as they injure the enamel.    224. _The mouth should be cleansed with pure tepid water at night, as  well as in the morning_; after which the teeth should be brushed  upward and downward, both on the posterior and anterior surfaces. It  may be beneficial to use refined soap, once or twice every week, to  remove any corroding substance that may exist around the teeth; care  being taken to thoroughly rinse the mouth after its use.    225. _Food or drink should not be taken into the mouth when very hot  or very cold._ Sudden changes of temperature will crack the enamel,  and finally produce decayed teeth.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    222. What is another use of the teeth? 223-232. _Give the hygiene of  the teeth._ 223. How can the teeth be preserved? By what means? 224.  How often should they be cleansed? 225. What is said of very hot or  cold drinks?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    _Observation._ On this account, smoking is pernicious, because the  teeth are subjected to an alternate inhalation of both cold and warm  air.    226. _The temporary teeth should be removed as soon as they become  loose._ If a permanent tooth makes it appearance before the first is  removed, or has become loose, the milk tooth, although not loose,  should be removed without delay. This is necessary that the second set  of teeth may present a regular and beautiful appearance.    227. _In general, when the permanent teeth are irregular, one or more  should be removed._ If the teeth are crowded and irregular, in  consequence of the jaw being narrow and short, or when they press so  hard upon each other as to injure the enamel, remove one or more to  prevent their looking unsightly, and in a few months the remaining  teeth, with a little care, will fill the spaces.    _Observation._ When it is necessary to remove a tooth, apply to some  skilful operator. It requires as much skill and knowledge to extract  teeth _well_, as it does to amputate a limb; yet some persons, who  possess strong arms, will obtain a pair of forceps, or a tooth-key,  and hang out the sign of \"surgeon-dentist,\" although ignorant of the  principles that should guide them.    228. _It is not always necessary to have teeth extracted when they  ache._ The nerve, or the investing membrane of the root, may be  diseased, and the tooth still be sound. In such instances, the tooth  should not be extracted, but the diseased condition may be remedied by  proper medication. There are many sound teeth, that become painful, as  already mentioned, which are unnecessarily removed.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    Why is smoking injurious to the teeth? 226. What remark respecting the  temporary teeth? 227. What remarks respecting the permanent teeth? Do  those persons that extract teeth require skill as well as knowledge?  228. Why should not teeth be extracted at all times when they are  painful?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    _Illustration._ Dr. H.
