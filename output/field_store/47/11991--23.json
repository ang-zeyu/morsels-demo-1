This  gentleman, formerly Ambassador to the United States, has enriched the  volume with historical notes and commentaries.           *       *       *       *       *    LOUIS BLANC has published a political pamphlet called _Plus de  Girondins_ (No more Girondins), in which the opposition of the extreme  party to the moderate party is expressed with the greatest force. The  freedom of the press, and the liberty of public meeting, he wishes  entirely unlimited, and the clubs to be every where opened as popular  schools of politics. Exile has but knit him more closely to the  democratic ideas, for whose development he hoped so much in the  Revolution of '48. His compeer, Ledru Rollin, achieved nothing by his  last year's work upon the Decadence of England, but ridicule in England,  and no great fame at home.           *       *       *       *       *    A curious anecdote is told of SCRIBE, the French vaudevilliste. He was  one day at work in his cabinet, when a young man entered. It was  Lacenaire. He seemed very modest, and stated delicately the occasion of  his visit. He had been appointed to a situation in Belgium, but was  entirely without means, and requested of Scribe thirty or forty francs  to pay his way to Brussels. Scribe was attracted by the young man's tone  and manner. \"Thirty to forty francs,\" said he, \"are too few. I must give  you a hundred, and if you choose to repay them, you can do so to an old  woman in Brussels, who was a servant of our family. Here is her  address.\" So saying, Scribe went to his drawer and took out the gold for  the young man, who expressed his gratitude with all the elegance of a  cultivated and sensitive mind, and left a copy of verses with Scribe for  a remembrance. Since then Lacenaire has confessed that he knew the  arrangement of Scribe's chamber, and had chosen an hour when the  servants were absent. \"I put myself between Scribe and the bell-rope,  and if he had refused me, I should have made short and noiseless work  with my knife. Scribe owed his life to his generosity.\" In this little  story is there not an averted tragedy as sad as Eugene Aram's?           *       *       *       *       *    A new work, of great importance to the oriental student, will soon reach  England from Siam, where it has been already published. It is a new  Siamese grammar, prepared by the Roman Catholic Vicar General, who has  resided in Siam for twenty years. In the \"Journal of the English  Archipelago,\" Mr. Taylor Jones announces the work and its value, with  some illustrative facts in the author's life. The bishop brings to the  task not alone his own remarkable intelligence and devotion, but the  results of the inquiries of his predecessors for two centuries. The work  forms a quarto of two hundred and forty-six pages, and treats of a mass  of matter necessary to the understanding of the language, but which is  not elsewhere to be found. Among this the reckoning of time, of money,  measures, and weights, as well as chronology, literature, and religion,  are included. The eight or ten pages devoted to chronology afford a  clear and just insight into the old history of Siam. The enumeration of  Siamese books, although not complete, shows that Siamese literature is  by no means poor. The miscellaneous list contains one hundred and fifty  various books upon grammar, arithmetic, astronomy, astrology, and  history, and many poetical works, especially romances. The various  warlike romances of China are very faithfully translated and broadly  diffused in Siam. Sometimes these ponderous productions climb to a  series of ninety volumes. The historical reports of Siam make forty  volumes, and there are no less than thirty-six holy Buddhist books. A  sketch of Buddhism is given in the present work, and the good bishop is  now about commencing a Siamese dictionary.           *       *       *       *       *    The literature of democracy has received another illustration in a  social tragedy in five acts, by the citizen Xavier Sauriac, entitled The  Death of Jesus. Its object of course is to embody dramatically the  sentiment of the old Revolution that Jesus Christ was a _Sans Culottes_,  akin to the feeling which causes ardent abolitionists to assert that he  was a negro. This tragedy makes Jesus Christ a democratic philosopher,  Herod an apostle, Magdalen a kind of Fleur de Marie. The hero rehearses  a plan for the salvation of the world, which is simply crude communism.  We quote an illustration:        \"Quand l'etat, heritier de la famille eteinte,      Sera du sol entier possesseur sans contrainte,      Qu'il serve alors de pere a tous les citoyens      Et de la vie a tous depense les moyens.\"    And again:        \"Dans les bizars brillante du luxe industriel,      Il devienue lui seul, marchand universel.\"    This work is probably a very sincere one, and deserves a prominent place  among the curiosities of literature. Nevertheless, such familiar  presentation of the Saviour is not only blasphemous but ridiculous.           *       *       *       *       *    MR. ALEXANDER DUFAI has published in Paris a satire on socialist women,  under the title of _Lelila, ou la Femme Socialiste_, and the journals of  the sect are very angry with him that he illustrates the tendencies of  socialism by presenting as his heroine its female apostle, George Sand.  That there may be no doubt of his intention, he tells us in the preface  that he has made _Lelila_ narrate her childhood, education, and poetic  dreams, her marriage with a _sous prefet_, who did not \"understand\" her,  and her amours with a poet who _did_ understand her, for he carried her  off; he has also made _Lelila_ marry by turns all the socialist systems  in the persons of their chiefs; and finally, shows her in the revolution  of 1848, presiding at _Le Club des Femmes_, and playing an active part  in public life. \"After this,\" observes the _Leader_, \"he has the  shameless audacity to say he attacks the 'species,' not the  'individual!'\"           *       *       *       *       *    The two last volumes of the Remains of SAINT-MARTIN have just been  issued from the National Press in Paris, under the title, _Fragments of  a History of the Arsacides, posthumous work of M. Saint-Martin_. He was  a well-known French _litterateur_, and director of the library of the  Arsenal. Strange stories are told of his unwearied diligence and  devotion to details. He was the original proposer of a plan for a  systematic and scientific investigation of oriental antiquities, and  another for a collection of oriental classics. This latter was his  darling project, for the execution of which Louis XVIII. granted a  commission; but the revolution of 1830 ruined his hopes. Yet a new  commission was named, and on the day upon which it was to hold its first  session, Saint-Martin was stricken by the cholera, and died without  knowing that the hope of his life would be fulfilled.           *       *       *       *       *    The _Univers_ at Paris announces a newly-discovered document in relation  to the trial of Louis XVI., proving that the report of the Debates in  the _Moniteur_ were falsified. This document is reported to have been  published on the third of January, 1794, but has escaped all the  historians. It occurs in the report of the commission appointed by the  Convention to examine the papers found in Robespierre's possession. A  letter turns up, written by the editor of the Debates of the Convention  in the _Moniteur_ to Robespierre, and of this import: \"You know that we  always report more fully the speeches of the Mountain than of the other  side. In Convet's complaint against you, I printed only a short sketch  of his first point, but the whole of your reply. And in the report of  the King's trial I introduced on his side only enough to preserve an  appearance of impartiality,\" &c., &c. Lamartine received these papers to  examine when he announced his history of the Girondins, but returned  them, saying that he could make no use of them.           *       *       *       *       *    An important work is announced by Joubert in Paris, _Les Murailles  Revolutionaries_, being a complete collection of professions of faith,  proclamations, placards, decrees, bulletins, facsimiles of signatures,  inedited autographs, &c., from February, 1848, to the present day: three  volumes quarto. It is to be published in twenty-four parts, one part  every month, and will supply a very important want of the future  historian of these last remarkable years.           *       *       *       *       *    M. UBICINI has just published in Paris a very interesting work on the  Ottomans, _Lettres sur la Turquie_. These letters were first printed in  successive numbers of the _Moniteur_, from March, 1850, to the present  summer, and they treat with decided ability and with freshness the chief  subjects connected with Mohammedan civilization, and with the present  condition and prospects of the Turkish empire, as the government,  administration, army, finances, agriculture, commerce, public  instruction, organization of religion, &c.           *       *       *       *       *    The _Collection of Sacred Moralists_, which has been for some time in  course of publication in Paris, under the editorial supervision of the  famous editor of French classics, M. Lefevre, has been just completed by  the publication of the two volumes, of which one contains the _Moral  Thoughts_ of Confucius, and the other the work known as _The Sacred Book  of China_.           *       *       *       *       *    M. REGNAULT'S new book, which he would have regarded as a completion of  Louis Blanc's _Histoire de Dix Ans_, is described as a very violent and  not very clever pamphlet.           *       *       *       *       *    LAMARTINE'S sentimental "]]]
