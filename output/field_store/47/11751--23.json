The hole was so small that he had to go on  his hands and knees to pass through it, and when he was able to stand  he was only the same height as the little fairyman. After walking three  or four steps they were in a splendid room, as bright as day. Diamonds  sparkled in the roof as stars sparkle in the sky when the night is  without a cloud. The roof rested on golden pillars, and between the  pillars were silver lamps, but their light was dimmed by that of the  diamonds. In the middle of the room was a table, on which were two  golden plates and two silver knives and forks, and a brass bell as big  as a hazelnut, and beside the table were two little chairs covered with  blue silk and satin.    \"Take a chair,\" said the fairy, \"and I will ring for the wand of  speech.\"    The dwarf sat down, and the fairyman rang the little brass bell, and in  came a little weeny dwarf no bigger than your hand.    \"Bring me the wand of speech,\" said the fairy, and the weeny dwarf bowed  three times and walked out backwards, and in a minute he returned,  carrying a little black wand with a red berry at the top of it, and,  giving it to the fairy, he bowed three times and walked out backwards as  he had done before.    The little man waved the rod three times over the dwarf, and struck him  once on the right shoulder and once on the left shoulder, and then  touched his lips with the red berry, and said: \"Speak!\"    The dwarf spoke, and he was so rejoiced at hearing the sound of his own  voice that he danced about the room.    \"Who are you at all, at all?\" said he to the fairy.    \"Who is yourself?\" said the fairy. \"But come, before we have any talk  let us have something to eat, for I am sure you are hungry.\"    Then they sat down to table, and the fairy rang the little brass bell  twice, and the weeny dwarf brought in two boiled snails in their shells,  and when they had eaten the snails he brought in a dormouse, and when  they had eaten the dormouse he brought in two wrens, and when they had  eaten the wrens he brought in two nuts full of wine, and they became  very merry, and the fairyman sang \"Cooleen dhas,\" and the dwarf sang  \"The little blackbird of the glen.\"    \"Did you ever hear the 'Foggy Dew'?\" said the fairy.    \"No,\" said the dwarf.    \"Well, then, I'll give it to you; but we must have some more wine.\"    And the wine was brought, and he sang the \"Foggy Dew,\" and the dwarf  said it was the sweetest song he had ever heard, and that the fairyman's  voice would coax the birds off the bushes.    \"You asked me who I am?\" said the fairy.    \"I did,\" said the dwarf.    \"And I asked you who is yourself?\"    \"You did,\" said the dwarf.    \"And who are you, then?\"    \"Well, to tell the truth, I don't know,\" said the dwarf, and he blushed  like a rose.    \"Well, tell me what you know about yourself.\"    \"I remember nothing at all,\" said the dwarf, \"before the day I found  myself going along with a crowd of all sorts of people to the great fair  of the Liffey. We had to pass by the king's palace on our way, and as we  were passing the king sent for a band of jugglers to come and show their  tricks before him. I followed the jugglers to look on, and when the play  was over the king called me to him, and asked me who I was and where I  came from. I was dumb then, and couldn't answer; but even if I could  speak I could not tell him what he wanted to know, for I remembered  nothing of myself before that day. Then the king asked the jugglers, but  they knew nothing about me, and no one knew anything, and then the king  said he would take me into his service; and the only work I have to do  is to go once a month with a bag of corn to the hut in the lonely moor.\"    \"And there you fell in love with the little princess,\" said the fairy,  winking at the dwarf.    The poor dwarf blushed twice as much as he had done before.    \"You need not blush,\" said the fairy; \"it is a good man's case. And now  tell me, truly, do you love the princess, and what would you give to  free her from the spell of enchantment that is over her?\"    \"I would give my life,\" said the dwarf.    \"Well, then, listen to me,\" said the fairy. \"The Princess Finola was  banished to the lonely moor by the king, your master. He killed her  father, who was the rightful king, and would have killed Finola, only he  was told by an old sorceress that if he killed her he would die himself  on the same day, and she advised him to banish her to the lonely moor,  and she said she would fling a spell of enchantment over it, and that  until the spell was broken Finola could not leave the moor. And the  sorceress also promised that she would send an old woman to watch over  the princess by night and by day, so that no harm should come to her;  but she told the king that he himself should select a messenger to take  food to the hut, and that he should look out for someone who had never  seen or heard of the princess, and whom he could trust never to tell  anyone anything about her; and that is the reason he selected you.\"    \"Since you know so much,\" said the dwarf, \"can you tell me who I am, and  where I came from?\"    \"You will know that time enough,\" said the fairy. \"I have given you back  your speech. It will depend solely on yourself whether you will get back  your memory of who and what you were before the day you entered the  king's service. But are you really willing to try and break the spell of  enchantment and free the princess?\"    \"I am,\" said the dwarf.    \"Whatever it will cost you?\"    \"Yes, if it cost me my life,\" said the dwarf; \"but tell me, how can the  spell be broken?\"    \"Oh, it is easy enough to break the spell if you have the weapons,\" said  the fairy.    \"And what are they, and where are they?\" said the dwarf.    \"The spear of the shining haft and the dark blue blade and the silver  shield,\" said the fairy. \"They are on the farther bank of the Mystic  Lake in the Island of the Western Seas. They are there for the man who  is bold enough to seek them. If you are the man who will bring them back  to the lonely moor you will only have to strike the shield three times  with the haft, and three times with the blade of the spear, and the  silence of the moor will be broken for ever, the spell of enchantment  will be removed, and the princess will be free.\"    \"I will set out at once,\" said the dwarf, jumping from his chair.    \"And whatever it cost you,\" said the fairy, \"will you pay the price?\"    \"I will,\" said the dwarf.    \"Well, then, mount your horse, give him his head, and he will take you  to the shore opposite the Island of the Mystic Lake. You must cross to  the island on his back, and make your way through the water-steeds that  swim around the island night and day to guard it; but woe betide you if  you attempt to cross without paying the price, for if you do the angry  water-steeds will rend you and your horse to pieces. And when you come  to the Mystic Lake you must wait until the waters are as red as wine,  and then swim your horse across it, and on the farther side you will  find the spear and shield; but woe betide you if you attempt to cross  the lake before you pay the price, for if you do, the black Cormorants  of the Western Seas will pick the flesh from your bones.\"    \"What is the price?\" said the dwarf.    \"You will know that time enough,\" said the fairy; \"but now go, and good  luck go with you.\"    The dwarf thanked the fairy, and said good-by. He then threw the reins  on his horse's neck, and started up the hill, that seemed to grow bigger  and bigger as he ascended, and the dwarf soon found that what he took  for a hill was a great mountain. After traveling all the day, toiling up  by steep crags and heathery passes, he reached the top as the sun was  setting in the ocean, and he saw far below him out in the waters the  island of the Mystic Lake.    He began his descent to the shore, but long before he reached it the sun  had set, and darkness, unpierced by a single star, dropped upon the sea.  The old horse, worn out by his long and painful journey, sank beneath  him, and the dwarf was so tired that he rolled off his back and fell  asleep by his side.    He awoke at the breaking of the morning, and saw that he was almost at  the water's edge. He looked out to sea, and saw the island, but nowhere  could he see the water-steeds, and he began to fear he must have taken  a wrong course in the night, and that the island before him was not the  one he was in search of. But even while he was so thinking he heard  fierce and angry snortings, and, coming swiftly from the island to the  shore, he saw the swimming and prancing steeds. Sometimes their heads  and manes only were visible, and sometimes, rearing, they rose half out  of the water, and, striking it with their hoofs, churned it into foam,  and tossed the white spray to the skies. As they approached nearer and  nearer their snortings became more terrible, and their nostrils shot  forth clouds of vapor. The dwarf trembled at the sight and sound, and  his old horse, quivering in every limb, moaned piteously, as if in pain.  On came the steeds, until they almost touched the shore, then rearing,  they seemed about to spring on to it. The frightened dwarf turned his  head to fly, and as he did so he heard the twang of a golden harp, and  right before him who should he see but the little man of the hills,  holding a harp in one hand and striking the strings with the other.    \"Are you ready to pay the price?\" said he, nodding gayly to the dwarf.    As he asked the question, the listening water-steeds snorted more  furiously than ever.    \"Are you ready to pay the price?\" said the little man a second time.    A shower of spray, tossed on shore by the angry steeds, drenched the  dwarf to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22169"],[0,"The Story of the Barbary Corsairs (#18)"],[1,"crews, and two thousand corpses were flung into the  sea. It was impossible to lay siege to Tripoli with a diseased army,  and when actually in sight of their object the admirals gave orders to  return to Jerba.    A sudden descent quickly gave them the command of the beautiful  island. The Arab sheykh whose people cultivated it was as ready to pay  tribute to the Spaniard as to the Corsair. Medina-Celi and his troops  accordingly set to work undisturbed at the erection of a fortress  strong enough to baffle the besieging genius even of the Turks. In two  months a strong castle was built, with all scientific earthworks, and  the admiral prepared to carry home such troops as were not needed for  its defence.    Unhappily for him, he had lingered too long. He had wished to see the  defences complete, and had trusted to the usual practice of the Turks,  not to put to sea before May was advanced. He was about to prepare for  departure when news came that the Turkish fleet had been seen at Goza.  Instantly all was panic. Valiant gentlemen forgot their valour, forgot  their coolness, forgot how strong a force by sea or land they  mustered: one thought alone was uppermost--the Turks were upon them!  Giovanni Doria hurried on board and embarked his Genoese; Medina-Celi  more methodically and with something like _sang froid_ personally  supervised the embarcation of his men; but before they could make out  of the strait, where Dragut had so narrowly escaped capture, the dread  Corsair himself, and Ochiali, and Pi[=a]li Pasha were upon them. Then  ensued a scene of confusion that baffles description. Despairing of  weathering the north side of Jerba the panic-stricken Christians ran  their ships ashore, and deserted them, never stopping even to set them  on fire. The deep-draught galleons stuck fast in the shallow water. On  rowed the Turks; galleys and galleons to the number of fifty-six fell  into their hands; eighteen thousand Christians bowed down before their  scimitars; the beach, on that memorable 11th of May, 1560, was a  confused medley of stranded ships, helpless prisoners, Turks busy in  looting men and galleys--and a hideous heap of mangled bodies. The  fleet and the army which had sailed from Messina but three months ago  in such gallant array were absolutely lost. It was a _dies nefas_ for  Christendom.    Medina-Celi and young Doria made good their escape by night. But when  the old Genoese admiral learnt the terrible news, the loss of the  fleet he loved, the defeat of the nephew he loved yet more, his dim  eyes were wet. \"Take me to the church,\" he said; and he soon received  the last consolations of religion. Long as he had lived, and many as  had been the vicissitudes of his great career, he had willingly been  spared this last most miserable experience. On November 25, 1560, he  gave up the ghost: he was a great seaman, but still more a passionate  lover of his country;--despotic in his love, but not the less a noble  Genoese patriot.

THE KNIGHTS OF MALTA.    1565.      When Sultan Suleym[=a]n reflected on the magnanimity which he had  displayed towards the Knights of Rhodes in allowing them to depart in  peace in 1522, his feelings must have resembled those of Doria when he  thought of that inconsiderate release of Dragut in 1543. Assuredly the  royal clemency had been ill-rewarded; the Knights had displayed a  singular form of gratitude to the sparer of their lives; they had  devoted themselves to him, indeed, but devoted themselves to his  destruction. The cavaliers whom Charles V. suffered to perch on the  glaring white rock of Malta, in 1530, proved in no long time to be a  pest as virulent and all-pervading as even Rhodes had harboured. Seven  galleys they owned, and never more, but the seven were royal vessels,  splendidly armed and equipped, and each a match for two or three  Turkish ships.[44] Every year they cruised from Sicily to the Levant,  and many a prize laden with precious store they carried off to Malta.  The commerce of Egypt and Syria was in danger of annihilation; the  Barbary Corsairs, even Dragut himself, shunned a meeting with the red  galleys of \"the Religion,\" or their black _capitana_; and the Turkish  fleet, while holding undisputed sway over the Mediterranean, was not  nimble enough to surprise the Maltese squadron in its rapid and  incalculable expeditions. Jean de la Valette Parisot, General of the  Galleys and afterwards Grand Master, Francis of Lorraine, Grand Prior  of France, Romegas, prince of knights-errant, scoured the seas in  search of prey:--they were as true pirates as ever weathered the  \"white squall.\" The Knights lived by plunder as much as any Corsair;  but they tempered their freebooting with chivalry and devotions; they  were the protectors of the helpless and afflicted, and they preyed  chiefly upon the enemies of the Faith.    Meanwhile they built and built; Fort St. Elmo rose on the central  promontory, Forts St. Michael and St. Angelo were strengthened;  bastions were skilfully planned, flanking angles devised, ravelins and  cavaliers erected, ditches deepened, parapets raised, embrasures  opened, and every device of sixteenth-century fortification as  practised by Master Evangelista, chief engineer of the Order, was  brought into use. For the Knights knew that Suleym[=a]n lived and was  mightier than ever. Their cruisers had wrought sad havoc among his  subjects, and the Sultan would not long suffer the hornets of Rhodes  to swarm at Malta. They lived in constant expectation of attack, and  they spent all their strength and all their money in preparing for  the day of the Sultan's revenge. At last the time came: Suleym[=a]n  swore in his wrath that the miscreants should no longer defy him; he  had suffered them to leave Rhodes as gentlemen of honour--he would  consume them in Malta as one burns a nest of wasps.    At the time of the siege of 1565 the city or fortress of Malta was  situated, not as Valetta now stands on the west, but on the east side  of the Marsa or great harbour. To understand even the briefest  narrative of one of the most heroic deeds of war that the world has  seen, the position of the forts must be understood. (See the Plan.) On  the northern coast of the rocky island a bold promontory or rugged  tongue of land, Mount Sceberras, separates two deep bights or inlets.  The eastern of these was called Marsa Muset, or \"Middle Port,\" but was  unoccupied and without defences at the time of the siege, except that  the guns of St. Elmo, the fortress at the point of the Sceberras  promontory, commanded its mouth. The Marsa Kebir, or simply La Marsa,  the \"Great Port,\" was the chief stronghold of the Knights. Here four  projecting spits of rock formed smaller harbours on the western side.  The outermost promontory, the Pointe des Fourches, separated the Port  de la Renelle or La Arenela, from the open sea; Cape Salvador divided  the Arenela from the English Harbour; the Burg, the main fortress and  capital of the place, with Fort St. Angelo at its point, shot out  between the English Harbour and the Harbour of the Galleys; and the  Isle of La Sangle, joined by a sandy isthmus to the mainland, and  crowned by Fort St. Michael, severed the Galley Harbour from that of  La Sangle. All round these inlets high hills dominated the ports.  Behind Fort St. Elmo, the Sceberras climbed steeply to a considerable  height. Behind the Arenela and English Harbour rose Mount Salvador,  Calcara, and further back the Heights of St. Catherine. The Burg and  Fort St. Michael were overtopped by the Heights of St. Margaret,  whilst the Conradin plateau looked down upon the head of the Marsa and  the Harbour of La Sangle. To modern artillery and engineering the  siege would have been easy, despite the rocky hardness of the ground,  since the Knights had not had time to construct those field-works upon  the surrounding heights which were essential to the safety of the  forts. Even to the skilled but undeveloped artillery of the Turks, the  destruction of Malta ought not to have been either a difficult or  lengthy operation, had they begun at the right place.    To those who were acquainted with the ground, who had heard of the  siege of Rhodes, and knew that the Turks were not less but more  formidable in 1565 than in 1522, the issue of the struggle must have  appeared inevitable, when the huge Ottoman fleet hove in view on the  18th of May, 1565. One hundred and eighty vessels, of which two-thirds  were galleys-royal, carried more than thirty thousand fighting  men--the pick of the Ottoman army, tried Janissaries and Sip[=a]his,  horsemen from Thrace, rough warriors from the mountains of Anatolia,  eager volunteers from all parts of the Sultan's dominions. Mustafa  Pasha who had grown old in the wars of his master, commanded on land,  and Pi[=a]li was admiral of the fleet. Dragut was to join them  immediately, and the Sultan's order was that nothing should be done  till he arrived.    The Knights had not remained ignorant of the preparations that were  making against them. They sent to all Europe for help, and the Pope  gave money, and Spain promises: the Viceroy of Sicily would send  Spanish reinforcements by the 15th of June. They worked unceasingly at  their defences and did all that men could do to meet the advancing  storm. All told, they mustered but seven hundred Knights, and between  eight and nine thousand mercenaries of various nations, but chiefly  Maltese, who could only be trusted behind walls.    The Order was fortunate in its Grand Master. Jean de la Valette, born  in 1494, a"]]]
