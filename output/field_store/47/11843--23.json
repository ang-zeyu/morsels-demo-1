He  visited Kui-kiang on the river Kiang, which is very broad here, and  upon which 5000 ships can sail at the same moment; Kain-gui, which  supplies the Emperor's palace with corn; Ching-kiang where are two  Nestorian Christian churches; Ginguigui, now Tchang-tcheou, a busy  thriving city; and Singui, now called Soo-choo, a large town, which,  according to the very exaggerated account of the Venetian traveller,  has no less than 6000 bridges.    After spending some time at Vugui, probably Hou-tcheou, and at  Ciangan, now Kia-hing, Marco Polo reached the fine city of Quinsay,  after three days' march. This name means the \"City of Heaven,\" but  it is now called Hang-chow-foo. It is six leagues round; the river  Tsien-tang-kiang flows through it, and by its constant windings,  makes Quinsay almost a second Venice. This ancient capital of the  Soongs is almost as populous as Pekin; its streets are paved with  stones and bricks, and if we may credit Marco Polo's statement, it  contained \"600,000 houses, 4000 bathing establishments, and 12,000  stone bridges.\" In this city dwell the richest merchants in the  world with their wives, who are \"beautiful and angelic creatures.\"  It is the residence of a viceroy, who has besides, 140 other cities  under his dominion. Here was to be seen also the palace of the Mangi  sovereigns surrounded by beautiful gardens, lakes, and fountains,  the palace itself containing more than a thousand rooms. Kublai-Khan  draws immense revenues from this town and province, and it is by  tens of thousands of pounds we must reckon the income derived from  the sugar, salt, spices, and silk, which form the principal  productions of this country. At one day's journey south from Quinsay,  Marco Polo visited Chao-hing, Vugui, or Hou-tcheou, Ghengui or  Kui-tcheou, Cianscian or Yo-tcheou-fou (according to M. Charton),  and Soni-tchang-fou (according to M. Pauthier), and Cugui or  Kiou-tcheou, the last town in the kingdom of Quinsay; thence he  entered the kingdom of Fugui, whose chief town of the same name is  now called Fou-tcheou-foo, the capital of the province of Fo-kien.  According to Marco Polo, the inhabitants of this province are a  cruel warlike race, never sparing their enemies, of whom, after they  have killed them, they drink the blood and eat the flesh. After  passing by Quenlifu, now Kien-ning-foo, and Unguen, the traveller  entered Fugui, probably the modern town of Kuant-tcheou (called  Canton amongst us), and the chief town of the province, where a  large trade in pearls and precious stones was carried on, and in  five days he reached the port of Zaitem, probably the Chinese town  of Tsiuen-tcheou, which was the extreme point reached by him in this  exploration of south-eastern China.

Marco Polo returned to the court of Kublai-Khan when he had finished  the expedition of which we spoke in the last chapter. He was then  entrusted with several other missions, in which he found his  knowledge of the Turkish, Chinese, Mongolian, and Mantchorian  languages of the greatest use. He seems to have taken part in an  expedition to the islands in the Indian Ocean, and he brought back a  detailed account of this hitherto little known sea. There is a want  of clearness as to dates at this part of his life, which makes it  difficult to give a correct narrative of these voyages in their  right order. He gives a circumstantial account of the Island of  Cipango, a name applying to the group of islands which make up  Japan; but it does not appear that he actually entered that kingdom.  This country was famous for its wealth, and about 1264, some years  before Marco Polo arrived at the Tartar court, Kublai-Khan had tried  to conquer it and sent his fleet there with that purpose. They had  taken possession of a citadel and put all its valiant defenders to  the edge of the sword, but just at the moment of apparent victory a  storm arose and dispersed all the enemy's fleet, and thus the  expedition was useless. Marco Polo gives a long account of this  attempt, and adds many curious particulars as to Japanese customs.    Marco Polo, with his father and uncle, had now been seventeen years  in the service of Kublai-Khan, and even longer absent from their own  country; they had a great wish to revisit it, but the Emperor had  become so much attached to them, and valued their services so highly,  that he could not make up his mind to part with them. He tried in  every way to shake their resolution, offering them riches and honour  if only they would remain with him, but they still held to their  plan of returning to Europe; the Emperor then absolutely refused to  allow them to go, and Marco Polo could find no means of eluding the  surveillance of which he was the object, until circumstances arose  which quite changed Kublai-Khan's resolution.    A Mongol prince, named Arghun, whose dominions were in Persia, had  sent an ambassador to the Emperor to ask one of the princesses of  the blood royal, in marriage. Kublai-Khan acceded to his request and  sent off his daughter Cogatra to Prince Arghun, attended by a  numerous suite; but the countries by which they endeavoured to  travel were not safe; the caravan was soon stopped by disturbances  and rebellions, and after some months was obliged to return to the  Emperor's palace. The Persian ambassadors had heard Marco Polo  spoken of as a clever navigator who had had some experience of the  Indian Ocean, and they begged the Emperor to confide the Princess  Cogatra to his care, that he might conduct her to her future husband,  thinking that the voyage by sea would probably be attended by less  danger than a land journey.    After some demur Kublai-Khan acceded to their request, and equipped  a fleet of forty four-masted vessels, provisioning them for two  years. Some of these were very large, having a crew of 250 men, for  this was an important expedition worthy of the opulent Emperor of  China. Matteo, Nicolo, and Marco Polo set out with the Chinese  princess and the Persian ambassadors, and it was during this voyage,  which lasted eighteen months, that it seems most probable that Marco  Polo visited the islands of Sunda and other islands in the Indian  Ocean, as well as Ceylon and the towns on the coast of India. We  will follow him in his voyage and give his description of the places  that he visited in this hitherto little known portion of the globe.    [Illustration: Kublai-Khan equips a fleet.]    It must have been about 1291 or 1292 that the fleet left the port of  Zaitem, under the command of Marco Polo. He steered first for  Tchampa, a great country situated at the south of Cochin China, and  which contains the present province of Saigon, belonging to France.  This was not a new country to Marco Polo, as he had visited it about  1280, when he was on a mission for the Emperor. At this time,  Tchampa was under the dominion of the grand khan, and paid him an  annual tribute in elephants; when Marco Polo visited this country  before its conquest by Kublai-Khan, he found the reigning king had  no less than 326 children, of whom 150 were old enough to carry arms.    Leaving the peninsula of Cambodia, the fleet went in the direction  of Java, the rich island that Kublai-Khan had never been able to  subjugate, where abundance of pepper, cloves, nutmegs, &c., grew.  After putting into port at Condor and Sandur, at the extremity of  the peninsular of Cochin China, they reached the island of Pentam  (Bintang), situated near the eastern entrance of the straits of  Malacca, and the island of Sumatra, called Little Java. \"This island  is so much in the south,\" he says, \"that they never see there the  polar star,\" which is true as far as the inhabitants of the southern  part are concerned. It is very fertile, aloes growing most  luxuriantly; and here wild elephants and rhinoceroses (called by  Marco Polo unicorns) are found, and apes, too, in large numbers. The  fleet was detained five months on these shores by contrary winds,  and the traveller made the most of his time in visiting the  principal provinces of the island, such as Samara, Dagraian, and  Labrin (which boasts a great number of men with tails--evidently  apes), and the island of Fandur or Panchor, where the sago-tree  grows, from which a kind of flour is obtained that makes very good  bread.    At last the wind changed, and enabled the vessels to leave Little  Java, and after touching at Necaran, which must be one of the  Nicobar Islands, and at the Andaman group, whose inhabitants are  still cannibals, as they were in the time of Marco Polo, the fleet  took a south-westerly course and arrived on the coast of Ceylon.  \"This island,\" says the traveller in his narrative, \"was once much  larger, for according to the map of the world that the pilots of  these seas carry, it was once 3600 miles in circumference but the  north wind blows with such force in these parts that it caused a  part of the island to be submerged.\" This tradition is still held by  the inhabitants of Ceylon. Here are collected in abundance, rubies,  sapphires, topaz, amethysts, and other precious stones, such as  garnets, opals, agates, and sardonyx. The king of the country was  the possessor at this time of a most splendid ruby as long as the  palm of the hand, as thick as a man's arm, and red as fire, which  excited the envy of the grand khan, who vainly tried to induce"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24780"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from her Majesty's correspondence (#18)"],[1,"Lord Ellenborough. We could not help  contrasting this conduct with the subjection Lord John has shown to  his people. It is to his _own_ talent and firmness that Sir Robert  will owe his success, which cannot fail. He said he had been  determined not to go to a general election with the fetters the last  election had imposed upon him, and he had meant at the end of the next  Session to call the whole Conservative Party together and to declare  this to them, that he would not meet another Parliament pledged to the  maintenance of the Corn Laws, which could be maintained no longer, and  that he would make a public declaration to this effect before another  general election came on. This had been defeated by events coming too  suddenly upon him, and he had no alternative but to deal with the Corn  Laws before a national calamity would _force_ it on. The league had  made immense progress, and had enormous means at their disposal. If  he had resigned in November, Lord Stanley and the Protectionists would  have been prepared to form a Government, and a Revolution might have  been the consequence of it. Now they felt that it was too late.    Sir Robert has _an immense scheme in view_; he thinks he shall be able  to remove the contest entirely from the dangerous ground upon which it  has got--that of a war between the manufacturers, the hungry and the  poor against the landed proprietors, the aristocracy, which can only  end in the ruin of the latter; he will not bring forward a measure  upon the Corn Laws, but a much more comprehensive one. He will deal  with the whole commercial system of the country. He will adopt  the principle of the League, _that of removing all protection and  abolishing all monopoly_, but not in favour of one class and as a  triumph over another, but to the benefit of the nation, farmers as  well as manufacturers. He would begin with cotton, and take in all the  necessaries of life and corn amongst them. The experiments he had  made in 1842 and 1845 with boldness but with caution had borne out the  correctness of the principle: the wool duty was taken off, and wool  sold higher than ever before; foreign cattle were let in, and the  cattle of England stood better in the market than ever. He would not  ask for compensation to the land, but wherever he could give it, and  at the same time promote the social development, there he would do it,  but on that ground. For instance, one of the greatest benefits to  the country would be the establishment of a rural police on the  same principle as the metropolitan police. By taking this on the  Consolidated Fund, the landowners would be immensely relieved in all  those counties which kept a police. One of the heaviest charges on  the land was the present administration of law and the carrying on of  prosecutions. Sir Robert could fancy this to be very much improved  by the appointment of a _public_ prosecutor by the State, which would  give the State a power to prevent vexatious, illegal, and immoral  prosecutions, and reduce the expenses in an extraordinary degree. Part  of the maintenance of the poor, according to the Poor Law, might be  undertaken by the State. A great calamity must be foreseen, when the  innumerable railroads now in progress shall have been terminated,  which will be the case in a few years. This will throw an enormous  labouring population suddenly out of employment. There might be a  law passed which would provide employment for them, and improve the  agriculture and production of the country, by enabling the State to  advance money to the great proprietors for the improvements of their  estates, which they could not obtain otherwise without charging their  estates beyond what they already have to bear.    Sir Robert means to go with Mr Gladstone into all these details.    ALBERT.          [Pageheading: LORD PALMERSTON'S JUSTIFICATION]    [Pageheading: LORD PALMERSTON'S POLICY]      _Viscount Palmerston to Viscount Melbourne._[41]    BOWOOD, _26th December 1845._    MY DEAR MELBOURNE,--I return you with many thanks George Anson's  letter, which was enclosed in yours of the 23rd, which I received just  as we were setting off for this place. Pray, when next you write to  George Anson, say how gratefully I appreciate the kind consideration  on the part of H.R.H. Prince Albert, which suggested George Anson's  communication. But I can assure you that although John Russell, in his  Audience of the Queen, may inadvertently have overstated the terms in  which he had mentioned to me what Her Majesty had said to him about  my return to the Foreign Office, yet in his conversations with me upon  that subject he never said anything more than is contained in George  Anson's letter to you; and I am sure you will think that under all the  circumstances of the case he could hardly have avoided telling me thus  much, and making me aware of the impression which seemed to exist upon  the Queen's mind as to the way in which other persons might view my  return to the Foreign Office.    With regard to Her Majesty's own sentiments, I have always been  convinced that Her Majesty knows me too well to believe for an instant  that I do not attach the greatest importance to the maintenance, not  merely of peace with all foreign countries, but of the most friendly  relations with those leading Powers and States of the world with which  serious differences would be attended with the most inconvenience. As  to Peace, I succeeded, as the organ of Lord Grey's Government and of  yours, in preserving it unbroken during ten years[42] of great and  extraordinary difficulty; and, if now and then it unavoidably happened  during that period of time, that in pursuing the course of policy  which seemed the best for British interests, we thwarted the views  of this or that Foreign Power, and rendered them for the moment less  friendly, I think I could prove that in every case the object which we  were pursuing was of sufficient importance to make it worth our while  to submit to such temporary inconvenience. There never was indeed,  during those ten years, any real danger of war except on three  occasions; and on each of those occasions the course pursued by the  British Government prevented war. The first occasion was just after  the accession of the King of the French, when Austria, Russia, and  Prussia were disposed and preparing to attack France, and when the  attitude assumed by the British Government prevented a rupture. The  second was when England and France united by a Convention to wrest the  Citadel of Antwerp from the Dutch, and to deliver it over to the  King of the Belgians.[43] If England had not then joined with France,  Antwerp would have remained with the Dutch, or the attempt to take it  would have led to a war in Europe. The third occasion was when Mehemet  Ali's army occupied Syria, and when he was constantly threatening  to declare himself independent and to march on Constantinople; while  Russia, on the one hand, asserted that if he did so she would occupy  Constantinople, and on the other hand, France announced that if Russia  did so, she, France, would force the Dardanelles. The Treaty of July  1840, proposed and brought about by the British Government, and the  operations in execution of that Treaty, put an end to that danger;  and, notwithstanding what has often been said to the contrary, the  real danger of war arising out of the affairs of Syria was put an end  to, and not created by the Treaty of 1840.    I am well aware, however, that some persons both at home and abroad  have imbibed the notion that I am more indifferent than I ought to be  as to running the risk of war. That impression abroad is founded upon  an entire mistake, but is by some sincerely felt, and being sincere,  would soon yield to the evidence of contradictory facts. At home that  impression has been industriously propagated to a limited extent,  partly by the legitimate attacks of political opponents, and partly  by a little cabal within our own ranks. These parties wanted to attack  me, and were obliged to accuse me of something. They could not charge  me with failure, because we had succeeded in all our undertakings,  whether in Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Syria, China, or elsewhere; they  could not charge me with having involved the country in war, because,  in fact, we had maintained peace; and the only thing that was left for  them to say was that my policy had a _tendency_ to produce war, and I  suppose they would argue that it was quite wrong and against all rule  that it did not do so.    But notwithstanding what may have been said on this matter, the  transaction which has by some been the most criticised in this  respect, namely, the Treaty of 1840, and the operations connected with  it, were entirely approved by the leaders of the then Opposition, who,  so far from feeling any disposition to favour me, had always made a  determined run at the Foreign Policy of the Whig Government. The Duke  of Wellington, at the opening of the Session of 1841, said in  the House of Lords that he entirely approved our policy in that  transaction, and could not find that any fault had been committed  by us in working it out; and I happen to know that Sir Robert Peel  expressed to the representative of one of the German Powers, parties  to the Alliance, his entire approval of our course, while Lord  Aberdeen said to one of them, that the course I had taken in that  affair made him forgive me many things of former years, which he had  thought he never should have forgiven.    I am quite ashamed of the length to which this letter has grown, and  shall only add, with reference to our relations with France, that  I had some very friendly interviews with Thiers, who was my chief  antagonist in 1840, and that although we did not enter into any  conspiracy against Guizot and Peel, as the newspapers pretended, we  parted on very good terms, and he promised to introduce me to all his"]]]
