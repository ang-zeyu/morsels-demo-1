Of course  you are gossipped about--you know that.\"    \"Yes, I know it\"--grimly--\"and I don't care what they say about the  Captain and me. We are a queer pair--just as queer as they make us  out. You can believe what you like about us, but don't you believe a  word they say against Lynde. She's sweet and good and beautiful. It's  not her fault that she never went to church--it's her father's. Don't  you hold that against her.\"    The fierce yet repressed energy of her tone prevented Alan from  feeling any amusement over her simple defence of Lynde. Moreover, it  sounded unreasonably sweet in his ears.    \"I won't,\" he promised, \"but I don't suppose it would matter much to  Miss Oliver if I did. She did not strike me as a young lady who would  worry very much about other people's opinions.\"    If his object were to prolong the conversation about Lynde, he was  disappointed, for the old woman had turned abruptly to her work again  and, though Alan lingered for a few moments longer, she took no  further notice of him. But when he had gone she peered stealthily  after him from the door until he was lost to sight among the pines.    \"A well-looking man,\" she muttered. \"I wish Lynde had been home. I  didn't dare ask him to the house for I knew Anthony was in one of his  moods. But it's time something was done. She's woman grown and this is  no life for her. And there's nobody to do anything but me and I'm not  able, even if I knew what to do. I wonder why she hates men so.  Perhaps it's because she never knew any that were real gentlemen. This  man is--but then he's a minister and that makes a wide gulf between  them in another way. I've seen the love of man and woman bridge some  wider gulfs though. But it can't with Lynde, I'm fearing. She's so  bitter at the mere speaking of love and marriage. I can't think why.  I'm sure her mother and Anthony were happy together, and that was all  she's ever seen of marriage. But I thought when she told me of meeting  this young man on the shore there was something in her look I'd never  noticed before--as if she'd found something in herself she'd never  known was there. But she'll never make friends with him and I can't.  If the Captain wasn't so queer--\"    She stopped abruptly, for a tall lithe figure was coming up from the  shore. Lynde waved her hand as she drew near.    \"Oh, Emily, I've had such a splendid sail. It was glorious. Bad Emily,  you've been carrying water. Didn't I tell you never to do that when I  was away?\"    \"I didn't have to do it. That young minister up at Rexton met me and  brought it up. He's nice, Lynde.\"    Lynde's brow darkened. She turned and walked away to the house without  a word.    On his way home that night Alan met Isabel King on the main shore  road. She carried an armful of pine boughs and said she wanted the  needles for a cushion. Yet the thought came into Alan's mind that she  was spying on him and, although he tried to dismiss it as unworthy, it  continued to lurk there.    For a week he avoided the shore, but there came a day when its  inexplicable lure drew him to it again irresistibly. It was a warm,  windy evening and the air was sweet and resinous, the lake misty and  blue. There was no sign of life about Four Winds and the shore seemed  as lonely and virgin as if human foot had never trodden it. The  Captain's yacht was gone from the little harbour where it was  generally anchored and, though every flutter of wind in the scrub firs  made Alan's heart beat expectantly, he saw nothing of Lynde Oliver. He  was on the point of turning homeward, with an unreasoning sense of  disappointment, when one of Lynde's dogs broke down through the hedge  of spruces, barking loudly.    Alan looked for Lynde to follow, but she did not, and he speedily saw  that there was something unusual about the dog's behaviour. The animal  circled around him, still barking excitedly, then ran off for a short  distance, stopped, barked again, and returned, repeating the  manoeuvre. It was plain that he wanted Alan to follow him, and it  occurred to the young minister that the dog's mistress must be in  danger of some kind. Instantly he set off after him; and the dog, with  a final sharp bark of satisfaction, sprang up the low bank into the  spruces.    Alan followed him across the peninsula and then along the further  shore, which rapidly grew steep and high. Half a mile down the cliffs  were rocky and precipitous, while the beach beneath them was heaped  with huge boulders. Alan followed the dog along one of the narrow  paths with which the barrens abounded until nearly a mile from Four  Winds. Then the animal halted, ran to the edge of the cliff and  barked.    It was an ugly-looking place where a portion of the soil had evidently  broken away recently, and Alan stepped cautiously out to the brink and  looked down. He could not repress an exclamation of dismay and alarm.    A few feet below him Lynde Oliver was lying on a mass of mossy soil  which was apparently on the verge of slipping over a sloping shelf of  rock, below which was a sheer drop of thirty feet to the cruel  boulders below. The extreme danger of her position was manifest at a  glance; the soil on which she lay was stationary, yet it seemed as if  the slightest motion on her part would send it over the brink.    Lynde lay movelessly; her face was white, and both fear and appeal  were visible in her large dilated eyes. Yet she was quite calm and a  faint smile crossed her pale lips as she saw the man and the dog.    \"Good faithful Pat, so you did bring help,\" she said.    \"But how can I help you, Miss Oliver?\" said Alan hoarsely. \"I cannot  reach you--and it looks as if the slightest touch or jar would send  that broken earth over the brink.\"    \"I fear it would. You must go back to Four Winds and get a rope.\"    \"And leave you here alone--in such danger?\"    \"Pat will stay with me. Besides, there is nothing else to do. You will  find a rope in that little house where you put the water for Emily.  Father and Emily are away. I think I am quite safe here if I don't  move at all.\"    Alan's own common sense told him that, as she said, there was nothing  else to do and, much as he hated to leave her alone thus, he realized  that he must lose no time in doing it.    \"I'll be back as quickly as possible,\" he said hurriedly.    Alan had been a noted runner at college and his muscles had not  forgotten their old training. Yet it seemed to him an age ere he  reached Four Winds, secured the rope, and returned. At every flying  step he was haunted by the thought of the girl lying on the brink of  the precipice and the fear that she might slip over it before he could  rescue her. When he reached the scene of the accident he dreaded to  look over the broken edge, but she was lying there safely and she  smiled when she saw him--a brave smile that softened her tense white  face into the likeness of a frightened child's.    \"If I drop the rope down to you, are you strong enough to hold to it  while the earth goes and then draw yourself up the slope hand over  hand?\" asked Alan anxiously.    \"Yes,\" she answered fearlessly.    Alan passed down one end of the rope and then braced himself firmly to  hold it, for there was no tree near enough to be of any assistance.  The next moment the full weight of her body swung from it, for at her  first movement the soil beneath her slipped away. Alan's heart  sickened; what if she went with it? Could she cling to the rope while  he drew her up?    Then he saw she was still safe on the sloping shelf. Carefully and  painfully she drew herself to her knees and, dinging to the rope,  crept up the rock hand over hand. When she came within his reach he  grasped her arms and lifted her up into safety beside him.    \"Thank God,\" he said, with whiter lips than her own.    For a few moments Lynde sat silent on the sod, exhausted with fright  and exertion, while her dog fawned on her in an ecstasy of joy.  Finally she looked up into Alan's anxious face and their eyes met. It  was something more than the physical reaction that suddenly flushed  the girl's cheeks. She sprang lithely to her feet.    \"Can you walk back home?\" Alan asked.    \"Oh, yes, I am all right now. It was very foolish of me to get into  such a predicament. Father and Emily went down the lake in the yacht  this afternoon and I started out for a ramble. When I came here I saw  some junebells growing right out on the ledge and I crept out to  gather them. I should have known better. It broke away under me and  the more I tried to scramble back the faster it slid down, carrying me  with it. I thought it would go right over the brink\"--she gave a  little involuntary shudder--\"but just at the very edge it stopped. I  knew I must lie very still or it would go right over. It seemed like  days. Pat was with me and I told him to go for help, but I knew there  was no one at home--and I was horribly afraid,\" she concluded with  another shiver. \"I never was afraid in my life before--at least not  with that kind of fear.\"    \"You have had a terrible experience and a narrow escape,\" said Alan  lamely. He could think of nothing more to say; his usual readiness of  utterance seemed to have failed him.    \"You saved my life,\" she said, \"you and Pat--for doggie must have his  share of credit.\"    \"A much larger share than mine,\" said Alan, smiling. \"If Pat had not  come for me, I would not have known of your danger. What a magnificent  fellow he is!\"    \"Isn't he?\" she agreed proudly. \"And so is Laddie, my other dog. He  went with Father today. I love my dogs more than people.\" She looked  at him with a little defiance in her eyes. \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24878"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1909 to 1922 (#18)"],[1,"r, and I have consented.\"    Charlotte gave a great gulp of disappointment, but the Pretty Lady  suddenly wheeled around to face the Tall Lady, with quivering lips and  tearful eyes.    \"Don't take her from me, Alma,\" she pleaded humbly. \"She--she is so  like my own baby and I'm so lonely. Any other child will suit you as  well.\"    \"Not at all,\" said the Tall Lady brusquely. \"Not at all, Anna. No  other child will suit me at all. And may I ask what you intend to keep  her on? I know your salary is barely enough for yourself.\"    \"That is my concern,\" said the Pretty Lady a little proudly.    \"Humph!\" The Tall Lady shrugged her shoulders. \"Just as independent as  ever, Anna, I see. Well, child, what do _you_ say? Which of us will  you come with? Remember, I have the cat on my side, and Anna can't  make half as good turnovers as I can. Remember all this, Charlotte.\"    \"Oh, I--I like you so much,\" stammered Charlotte, \"and I wish I could  live with you both. But since I can't, I must go with the Pretty Lady,  because I promised, and because I loved her first.\"    \"And best?\" queried the Tall Lady.    \"And best,\" admitted Charlotte, bound to be truthful, even at the risk  of hurting the Tall Lady's feelings. \"But I _do_ like you, too--next  best. And you really don't need me as much as she does, for you have  your Very Handsome Cat and she hasn't anything.\"    \"A cat no longer satisfies the aching void in my soul,\" said the Tall  Lady stubbornly. \"Nothing will satisfy it but a little girl with  mouse-coloured hair and freckles. No, Anna, I've got to have  Charlotte. But I think that with her usual astuteness, she has already  solved the problem for us by saying she'd like to live with us both.  Why can't she? You just come back home and we'll let bygones be  bygones. We both have something to forgive, but I was an obstinate old  fool and I've known it for years, though I never confessed it to  anybody but the cat.\"    The Pretty Lady softened, trembled, smiled. She went right up to the  Tall Lady and put her arms about her neck.    \"Oh, I've wanted so much to be friends with you again,\" she sobbed.  \"But I thought you would never relent--and--and--I've been so  lonely--\"    \"There, there,\" whispered the Tall Lady, \"don't cry under the matron's  eye. Wait till we get home. I may have some crying to do myself then.  Charlotte, go and get your hat and come right over with us. We can  sign the necessary papers later on, but we must have you right off.  The cat is waiting for you on the back porch, and there is a turnover  cooling on the pantry window that is just your size.\"    \"I am so happy,\" remarked Charlotte, \"that I feel like crying  myself.\"          Christmas at Red Butte      \"Of course Santa Claus will come,\" said Jimmy Martin confidently.  Jimmy was ten, and at ten it is easy to be confident. \"Why, he's _got_  to come because it is Christmas Eve, and he always _has_ come. You  know that, twins.\"    Yes, the twins knew it and, cheered by Jimmy's superior wisdom, their  doubts passed away. There had been one terrible moment when Theodora  had sighed and told them they mustn't be too much disappointed if  Santa Claus did not come this year because the crops had been poor,  and he mightn't have had enough presents to go around.    \"That doesn't make any difference to Santa Claus,\" scoffed Jimmy. \"You  know as well as I do, Theodora Prentice, that Santa Claus is rich  whether the crops fail or not. They failed three years ago, before  Father died, but Santa Claus came all the same. Prob'bly you don't  remember it, twins, 'cause you were too little, but I do. Of course  he'll come, so don't you worry a mite. And he'll bring my skates and  your dolls. He knows we're expecting them, Theodora, 'cause we wrote  him a letter last week, and threw it up the chimney. And there'll be  candy and nuts, of course, and Mother's gone to town to buy a turkey.  I tell you we're going to have a ripping Christmas.\"    \"Well, don't use such slangy words about it, Jimmy-boy,\" sighed  Theodora. She couldn't bear to dampen their hopes any further, and  perhaps Aunt Elizabeth might manage it if the colt sold well. But  Theodora had her painful doubts, and she sighed again as she looked  out of the window far down the trail that wound across the prairie,  red-lighted by the declining sun of the short wintry afternoon.    \"Do people always sigh like that when they get to be sixteen?\" asked  Jimmy curiously. \"You didn't sigh like that when you were only  fifteen, Theodora. I wish you wouldn't. It makes me feel funny--and  it's not a nice kind of funniness either.\"    \"It's a bad habit I've got into lately,\" said Theodora, trying to  laugh. \"Old folks are dull sometimes, you know, Jimmy-boy.\"    \"Sixteen _is_ awful old, isn't it?\" said Jimmy reflectively. \"I'll  tell you what _I'm_ going to do when I'm sixteen, Theodora. I'm going  to pay off the mortgage, and buy mother a silk dress, and a piano for  the twins. Won't that be elegant? I'll be able to do that 'cause I'm a  man. Of course if I was only a girl I couldn't.\"    \"I hope you'll be a good kind brave man and a real help to your  mother,\" said Theodora softly, sitting down before the cosy fire and  lifting the fat little twins into her lap.    \"Oh, I'll be good to her, never you fear,\" assured Jimmy, squatting  comfortably down on the little fur rug before the stove--the skin of  the coyote his father had killed four years ago. \"I believe in being  good to your mother when you've only got the one. Now tell us a story,  Theodora--a real jolly story, you know, with lots of fighting in it.  Only please don't kill anybody. I like to hear about fighting, but I  like to have all the people come out alive.\"    Theodora laughed, and began a story about the Riel Rebellion of '85--a  story which had the double merit of being true and exciting at the  same time. It was quite dark when she finished, and the twins were  nodding, but Jimmy's eyes were wide open and sparkling.    \"That was great,\" he said, drawing a long breath. \"Tell us another.\"    \"No, it's bedtime for you all,\" said Theodora firmly. \"One story at a  time is my rule, you know.\"    \"But I want to sit up till Mother comes home,\" objected Jimmy.    \"You can't. She may be very late, for she would have to wait to see  Mr. Porter. Besides, you don't know what time Santa Claus might  come--if he comes at all. If he were to drive along and see you  children up instead of being sound asleep in bed, he might go right on  and never call at all.\"    This argument was too much for Jimmy.    \"All right, we'll go. But we have to hang up our stockings first.  Twins, get yours.\"    The twins toddled off in great excitement, and brought back their  Sunday stockings, which Jimmy proceeded to hang along the edge of the  mantel shelf. This done, they all trooped obediently off to bed.  Theodora gave another sigh, and seated herself at the window, where  she could watch the moonlit prairie for Mrs. Martin's homecoming and  knit at the same time.    I am afraid that you will think from all the sighing Theodora was  doing that she was a very melancholy and despondent young lady. You  couldn't think anything more unlike the real Theodora. She was the  jolliest, bravest girl of sixteen in all Saskatchewan, as her shining  brown eyes and rosy, dimpled cheeks would have told you; and her sighs  were not on her own account, but simply for fear the children were  going to be disappointed. She knew that they would be almost  heartbroken if Santa Claus did not come, and that this would hurt the  patient hardworking little mother more than all else.    Five years before this, Theodora had come to live with Uncle George  and Aunt Elizabeth in the little log house at Red Butte. Her own  mother had just died, and Theodora had only her big brother Donald  left, and Donald had Klondike fever. The Martins were poor, but they  had gladly made room for their little niece, and Theodora had lived  there ever since, her aunt's right-hand girl and the beloved playmate  of the children. They had been very happy until Uncle George's death  two years before this Christmas Eve; but since then there had been  hard times in the little log house, and though Mrs. Martin and  Theodora did their best, it was a woefully hard task to make both ends  meet, especially this year when their crops had been poor. Theodora  and her aunt had made every sacrifice possible for the children's  sake, and at least Jimmy and the twins had not felt the pinch very  severely yet.    At seven Mrs. Martins bells jingled at the door and Theodora flew out.  \"Go right in and get warm, Auntie,\" she said briskly. \"I'll take Ned  away and unharness him.\"    \"It's a bitterly cold night,\" said Mrs. Martin wearily. There was a  note of discouragement in her voice that struck dismay to Theodora's  heart.    \"I'm afraid it means no Christmas for the children tomorrow,\" she  thought sadly, as she led Ned away to the stable. When she returned to  the kitchen Mrs. Martin was sitting by the fire, her face in her  chilled hand, sobbing convulsively.    \"Auntie--oh, Auntie, don't!\" exclaimed Theodora impulsively. It was  such a rare thing to see her plucky, resolute little aunt in tears.  \"You're cold and tired--I'll have a nice cup of tea for you in a  trice.\"    \"No, it isn't that,\" said Mrs. Martin brokenly \"It was seeing those  stockings hanging there. Theodora, I couldn't get a thing for the  children--not a single thing. Mr. Porter would only give forty dollars  for the colt, and when all the bills were paid there was barely enough  left for such necessaries as we must have. I suppose I ought to feel  thankful I could get those. But the thought of the children's  disappointment tomorrow is more than I can bear. It would have been  better to have told them long ago, but I kept building on getting more  for the colt. Well, it's weak and foolish to give way like this. We'd  better both take a cup of tea and go"]]]
