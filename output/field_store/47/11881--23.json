[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2641"],[0,"A Room with a View (#18)"],[1," Mr. Vyse had the art of  placing one in the most tiresome positions. He was driven to use the  prerogatives of his profession.    \"No, I have said nothing indiscreet. I foresaw at Florence that her  quiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended. I realized dimly  enough that she might take some momentous step. She has taken it. She  has learnt--you will let me talk freely, as I have begun freely--she has  learnt what it is to love: the greatest lesson, some people will tell  you, that our earthly life provides.\" It was now time for him to wave  his hat at the approaching trio. He did not omit to do so. \"She has  learnt through you,\" and if his voice was still clerical, it was now  also sincere; \"let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to  her.\"    \"Grazie tante!\" said Cecil, who did not like parsons.    \"Have you heard?\" shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping  garden. \"Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?\"    Freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march. Youth seldom  criticizes the accomplished fact.    \"Indeed I have!\" he cried. He looked at Lucy. In her presence he could  not act the parson any longer--at all events not without apology.  \"Mrs. Honeychurch, I'm going to do what I am always supposed to do, but  generally I'm too shy. I want to invoke every kind of blessing on  them, grave and gay, great and small. I want them all their lives to be  supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife, as father and  mother. And now I want my tea.\"    \"You only asked for it just in time,\" the lady retorted. \"How dare you  be serious at Windy Corner?\"    He took his tone from her. There was no more heavy beneficence, no more  attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures. None of  them dared or was able to be serious any more.    An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all  who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe. Away from it, in the  solitude of their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be  critical. But in its presence and in the presence of each other they  were sincerely hilarious. It has a strange power, for it compels not  only the lips, but the very heart. The chief parallel to compare one  great thing with another--is the power over us of a temple of some alien  creed. Standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel  sentimental. Inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become  true believers, in case any true believer should be present.    So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon  they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant  tea-party. If they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their  hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true. Anne,  putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated them  greatly. They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave  them ere she kicked the drawing-room door. Mr. Beebe chirruped. Freddy  was at his wittiest, referring to Cecil as the \"Fiasco\"--family honoured  pun on fiance. Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised well as  a mother-in-law. As for Lucy and Cecil, for whom the temple had been  built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as earnest  worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy.        Chapter IX: Lucy As a Work of Art    A few days after the engagement was announced Mrs. Honeychurch made Lucy  and her Fiasco come to a little garden-party in the neighbourhood, for  naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying a  presentable man.    Cecil was more than presentable; he looked distinguished, and it was  very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with Lucy, and his  long, fair face responding when Lucy spoke to him. People congratulated  Mrs. Honeychurch, which is, I believe, a social blunder, but it pleased  her, and she introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy  dowagers.    At tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over Lucy's  figured silk, and though Lucy feigned indifference, her mother feigned  nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated  by a sympathetic maid. They were gone some time, and Cecil was left with  the dowagers. When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been.    \"Do you go to much of this sort of thing?\" he asked when they were  driving home.    \"Oh, now and then,\" said Lucy, who had rather enjoyed herself.    \"Is it typical of country society?\"    \"I suppose so. Mother, would it be?\"    \"Plenty of society,\" said Mrs. Honeychurch, who was trying to remember  the hang of one of the dresses.    Seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere, Cecil bent towards Lucy and  said:    \"To me it seemed perfectly appalling, disastrous, portentous.\"    \"I am so sorry that you were stranded.\"    \"Not that, but the congratulations. It is so disgusting, the way an  engagement is regarded as public property--a kind of waste place where  every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment. All those old women  smirking!\"    \"One has to go through it, I suppose. They won't notice us so much next  time.\"    \"But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong. An  engagement--horrid word in the first place--is a private matter, and  should be treated as such.\"    Yet the smirking old women, however wrong individually, were racially  correct. The spirit of the generations had smiled through them,  rejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised the  continuance of life on earth. To Cecil and Lucy it promised something  quite different--personal love. Hence Cecil's irritation and Lucy's  belief that his irritation was just.    \"How tiresome!\" she said. \"Couldn't you have escaped to tennis?\"    \"I don't play tennis--at least, not in public. The neighbourhood is  deprived of the romance of me being athletic. Such romance as I have is  that of the Inglese Italianato.\"    \"Inglese Italianato?\"    \"E un diavolo incarnato! You know the proverb?\"    She did not. Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a  quiet winter in Rome with his mother. But Cecil, since his engagement,  had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from  possessing.    \"Well,\" said he, \"I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me. There  are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must  accept them.\"    \"We all have our limitations, I suppose,\" said wise Lucy.    \"Sometimes they are forced on us, though,\" said Cecil, who saw from her  remark that she did not quite understand his position.    \"How?\"    \"It makes a difference doesn't it, whether we fully fence ourselves in,  or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others?\"    She thought a moment, and agreed that it did make a difference.    \"Difference?\" cried Mrs. Honeychurch, suddenly alert. \"I don't see any  difference. Fences are fences, especially when they are in the same  place.\"    \"We were speaking of motives,\" said Cecil, on whom the interruption  jarred.    \"My dear Cecil, look here.\" She spread out her knees and perched her  card-case on her lap. \"This is me. That's Windy Corner. The rest of the  pattern is the other people. Motives are all very well, but the fence  comes here.\"    \"We weren't talking of real fences,\" said Lucy, laughing.    \"Oh, I see, dear--poetry.\"    She leant placidly back. Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.    \"I tell you who has no 'fences,' as you call them,\" she said, \"and  that's Mr. Beebe.\"    \"A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.\"    Lucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect  what they meant. She missed Cecil's epigram, but grasped the feeling  that prompted it.    \"Don't you like Mr. Beebe?\" she asked thoughtfully.    \"I never said so!\" he cried. \"I consider him far above the average. I  only denied--\" And he swept off on the subject of fences again, and was  brilliant.    \"Now, a clergyman that I do hate,\" said she wanting to say something  sympathetic, \"a clergyman that does have fences, and the most dreadful  ones, is Mr. Eager, the English chaplain at Florence. He was truly  insincere--not merely the manner unfortunate. He was a snob, and so  conceited, and he did say such unkind things.\"    \"What sort of things?\"    \"There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his  wife.\"    \"Perhaps he had.\"    \"No!\"    \"Why 'no'?\"    \"He was such a nice old man, I'm sure.\"    Cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence.    \"Well, I did try to sift the thing. Mr. Eager would never come to the  point. He prefers it vague--said the old man had 'practically' murdered  his wife--had murdered her in the sight of God.\"    \"Hush, dear!\" said Mrs. Honeychurch absently.    \"But isn't it intolerable that a person whom we're told to imitate  should go round spreading slander? It was, I believe, chiefly owing to  him that the old man was dropped. People pretended he was vulgar, but he  certainly wasn't that.\"    \"Poor old man! What was his name?\"    \"Harris,\" said Lucy glibly.    \"Let's hope that Mrs. Harris there warn't no sich person,\" said her  mother.    Cecil nodded intelligently.    \"Isn't Mr. Eager a parson of the cultured type?\" he asked.    \"I don't know. I hate him. I've heard him lecture on Giotto. I hate him.  Nothing can hide a petty nature. I HATE him.\"    \"My goodness gracious me, child!\" said Mrs. Honeychurch. \"You'll blow  my head off! Whatever is there to shout over? I forbid you and Cecil to  hate any more clergymen.\"    He smiled. There was indeed something rather incongruous in Lucy's moral  outburst over Mr. Eager. It was as if one should see the Leonardo on the  ceiling of the Sistine. He longed to hint to her that not here lay  her vocation; that a woman's power and charm reside in mystery, not  in muscular rant. But possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the  beautiful creature, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26457"],[0,"New observations on the natural history of bees (#18)"],[1,"cells, from which other queens will proceed after her departure.  The bees prepare these cells only while the queen lays male eggs; and a  remarkable fact attends it, that after this laying terminates, her belly  being considerably diminished, she can easily fly, whereas, her belly is  previously so heavy she can hardly drag it along. Therefore it is  necessary she should lay in order to be in a condition for undertaking  her journey, which may sometimes be very long.    But this single condition is not enough. It is also requisite that the  bees be very numerous: they should even be superabundant, and a person  might say they are aware of it: for, if the hive is thin, no royal cells  are constructed when the male eggs are laid, which is solely at the  period that the queen is able to conduct a colony. This fact was proved  by the following experiment on a large scale.    On the third of May 1788, we divided eighteen hives into two portions;  all the queens were about a year old. Thus each portion of the hives  had but half the bees that were originally there. Eighteen halves wanted  queens, but the other eighteen had very fertile ones. They soon began to  lay the eggs of males; but, the bees being few, they did not construct  royal cells, and none of the hives threw a swarm.--Therefore, if the  hive containing the old queen is not very populous, she remains in it  until the subsequent spring; and if the population is then sufficient,  royal cells will be constructed: the queen will begin to lay male eggs,  and, after depositing them, will issue forth at the head of a colony,  before the young queens are produced.    Such is a very brief abstract of my observations on swarms conducted by  old queens. You must excuse the long detail on which I am about to  enter, concerning the history of the royal cells left by the queen in  the hive. Every thing relative to this part of the history of bees has  hitherto been very obscure. A long course of observations, protracted  even during several years, was necessary to remove, in some degree, the  veil that concealed these mysteries. I have been indemnified for the  trouble, indeed, by the pleasure of seeing my experiments reciprocally  confirmed; but, considering the assiduity required in these researches,  they were truly very laborious.    Having established in 1788 and 1789, that queens a year old conducted  the first swarm, and that they left worms or nymphs in the hive to  transform into queens in their turn; I endeavoured, in 1790, to profit  by the goodness of the spring, to study all that related to these young  queens; and I shall now extract the chief experiments from my journal.    On the fourteenth of May, we introduced two portions of bees, from the  straw hives, into a large glass hive very flat; and allowed them only  one queen of the preceding year, and which had already commenced laying  in its native hive. We introduced her on the fifteenth. She was very  fertile. The bees received her well, and she soon began to lay in large  and small cells alternately.    On the twentieth, we saw the formation of twelve royal cells, all on the  edges of the communications, or passages through the combs, and shaped  liked stalactites.    On the twenty-seventh, ten were much but unequally enlarged; but none so  long as when the worms are hatched.    On the twenty-eighth, previous to which the queen had not ceased laying,  her belly was very slender, and she began to exhibit signs of agitation.  Her motion soon became more lively, yet she still continued examining  the cells as when about to lay; sometimes introducing half her belly,  but suddenly withdrawing it, without having laid. At other times she  deposited an egg, which lay in an irregular position, on one side of the  hexagon, and not fixed by an end to the bottom of the cell. The queen  produced no distinct sound in her course, and we heard nothing different  from the ordinary humming of bees. She passed over those in her way;  sometimes when she stopped, the bees meeting her also stopped; and  seemed to consider her. They advanced briskly, struck her with their  antennae, and mounted on her back. She then went on carrying some of the  workers on her back. None gave her honey, but she voluntarily took it  from the cells in her way. The bees no longer inclosed and formed  regular circles around her. The first, aroused by her motions, followed  her running in the same manner, and in their passage excited those still  tranquil on the combs. The way the queen had traversed was evident after  she left it, by the agitation created, which was never afterwards  quelled: she had soon visited every part of the hive, and occasioned a  general agitation; if some places still remained tranquil, the bees in  agitation arrived, and communicated their motion. The queen no longer  deposited her eggs in cells; she let them fall fortuitously: nor did the  bees any longer watch over the young; they ran about in every different  direction; even those returning from the fields, before the agitation  came to its height, no sooner entered the hive than they participated in  these tumultuous motions. They neglected to free themselves of the waxen  pellets on their limbs, and ran blindly about. At last the whole rushed  precipitately towards the outlets of the hive, and the queen along with  them.    As it was of much consequence to see the formation of new swarms in this  hive, and, for that reason, as I wished it to continue very populous, I  removed the queen, at the moment she came out, that the bees might not  fly too far, and that they might return. In fact, after losing their  female, they did return to the hive. To increase the population still  more, I added another swarm, which had come from a straw hive on the  same morning, and removed its queen also.    All these facts were certain, and appeared susceptible of no error.  Notwithstanding this, I was particularly earnest to learn whether old  queens always followed the same course; which induced me, on the  twenty-ninth, to replace, in the glass hive, the queen a year old, which  had hitherto been the subject of my experiments, and had just began to  lay the eggs of males. On the same day, we found one of the royal cells  left by the preceding queen larger than the rest; and, from its length,  supposed the included worm two days old: the egg had, therefore, been  laid on the twenty-fourth by that queen, and the worm was hatched on the  twenty-seventh. On the thirtieth, the queen laid a great deal in the  large and small cells alternately. Now, and the two following days, the  bees enlarged several royal cells, but unequally, which proved that they  included larvae of different ages. One was closed on the first of June,  and on the second another. The bees also commenced some new ones. All  was perfectly quiet at eleven in the morning; but, at mid-day, the  queen, from the utmost tranquillity, became evidently agitated; and her  agitation insensibly communicated to the workers in every part of their  dwelling. In a few minutes they precipitately crowded to the entrances,  and, along with the queen, left the hive. After they had settled on the  branch of a neighbouring tree, I sought for the queen; thinking that, by  removing her, the bees might return to the hive, which actually ensued.  Their first care seemed to consist in seeking the female; they were  still in great agitation, but gradually calmed; and in three hours  complete tranquillity was restored.    They had resumed their usual occupations on the third: they attended to  the young, worked within the open royal cells, and also watched on those  that were shut. They made a waved work on them, not by applying wax  cordons, but by removing wax from the surface. Towards the top this  waved work is almost imperceptible; it becomes deeper above, and the  workers excavate it still more from thence to the base of the pyramid.  The cell, when once shut, also becomes thinner; and is so much so,  immediately preceding the queen's metamorphosis from a nymph, that all  its motions are perceptible through the thin covering of wax on which  the waved work is founded. It is a very remarkable circumstance, that in  making the cells thinner, from the moment they are closed, the bees know  to regulate their labour so that it terminates only when the nymph is  ready to undergo its last metamorphosis.    On the seventh day the coccoon is almost completely _unwaxed_, if I may  use the expression, at the part next to the head and thorax of the  queen. This operation facilitates her exit; for she has nothing to do  but cut the silk that forms the coccoon. Most probably the object is, to  promote evaporation of the superabundant fluids of the nymph. I have  made some direct experiments to ascertain the fact, but they are yet  unfinished. A third royal cell was closed by the bees on the same day,  the third of June, twenty-four hours after closing the second. The like  was done to other royal cells successively, during the subsequent days.    Every moment of the seventh, we expected the queen to leave the royal  cell shut on the thirtieth of May. The seven days had elapsed. The  waving of her cell was so deep, that what passed within was pretty  perceptible; we could discern that the silk of the coccoon was cut  circularly, a line and a half from the extremity; but the bees being  unwilling that she should yet quit her cell, they had soldered the  covering to it with some particles of wax. What seemed most singular  was, that this female emitted a very distinct sound, or clacking from  her prison. It was still more audible in the evening, and even consisted  of several monotonous notes in rapid succession.    The same sound proceeded from the royal cell on the eighth. Several  bees kept guard round each royal cell.    The first cell opened on the ninth. The young queen was lively, slender,  and of a brown colour. Now, we understood"]]]
