[FF] \"The Deliverance, of 70 tonn, and the Patience, of 30 tonn.\" Letter  from the Lord Delaware, Governor of Virginia to the patentees in  England.--Introduction to Strachey's _Virginia Brittania_, p. xxiii.    His Lordship intendinge to send up certain forces to march towardes the  mountaines for the discoverie of gold or silver mines at the end of  October, sent his Patents to Captaine Yardley and Captaine Holcroft,  commanders of those two forts at Kicoughtan, wherin his Lordship gave  order that they should be forthwith abandoned & the people with all  speede to be brought to James Citie, there to prepare for his intended  march.    At that time there arrived a small ship called the daintie, with twelve  men & one woman, some little provision of victuall, two or three horses  & some other slight necessaries for the Collony. Soon after we sett  forward for our intended march, havinge for our leaders Captaine Edwarde  Brewster & Captaine George Yeardley, being in number one hundred  persons, furnished with all such necessary provisions, as the Collony at  that time out of its poverty was able to provide. This designe was  hindered by reason of the unfortunate losse of all our chieffe men  skillfull in findeinge out mines, who weare treacherously slaine by the  Salvadges (inviteinge them ashoare to eat victualls which they wanted)  even when the meate was in theire mouthes, they careinge only to fill  their bellies, foresaw not to prevent this danger which befell them.    This injury we revenged for the present (as we coulde) by killinge some  Indians and burninge many houses, but by reason of this disaster we  proceeded not farther on our journey then the head of the River, where  we spent about three moneths doinge little but induringe much; his  Lordship was there in person for the most part of that time, but his  disease of body groweinge much upon him he resolved to retire to James  Towne, givinge order that the fort which we had built there shoulde bee  quitted and the troupe drawn downe, which accordingly was done. His  Lordship then in regarde of his sickness was advised to putt to Sea in  his ship, the Delaware, to seeke remedie in some other parts for the  health of his bodye. At his going he left Captaine George Percie Deputie  Governor, the people (remaining under his command) provided for three  months at a short allowance of victuals. The calamities of these times  would not any way permit workes of great importance to bee performed,  sith that we did was as much as we coulde doe to live and defende our  selves.    The Plantations helde at his Lordships departure were only James Towne  and Pointe Comforte, where was a small Fort fenced with Pallisadoes, in  it one slight howse, a store and some few thatcht cabbins, which shortly  after by casualtie was burnt with fire; some few great ordinance were  slenderlye mounted at James Towne and Pointe Comfort.    A fortnight after his Lordship's departure arrived a small ship called  the Hercules, with some thirty people and some provisions for them. The  tweife of May followeinge arrived Sir Thomas Dale with three ships and  three hundred persons, his provisions for them of such qualitie (for the  most part) as hogges refused to eat, some whereof were sent backe to  England to testifie the same, and that the rest was not better was  justified upon oath before the Hono^{ble} the Lorde Cheife Justice of  the Common Pleas, at Guilde hall in London, by Sir Thos. Gates & two  other gentlemen.    Sir Thomas Dale, takinge into consideration the precedent times not to  have succeeded accordinge to the greedy desire of Sir Thomas Smith,  presently imployed the general Colony about the lading of those three  ships with such freight as the country then yealded, but a little before  the ships were readie to depart, Sir Thomas Gates arrived with three  ships and three carvills, with him three hundred persons meanly provided  with victualls for such a number. In this fleet, to our remembrance,  arrived sixtie cowes and some swine; it was his care to dispatch those  shipps and carvills fraighted (as aforesaid) to the neglect of workes of  greater importance. Sir Thomas Dale imediately uppon his arrival, to add  to that extremitye of miserye under which the Collonye from her infancie  groaned, made and published most cruell and tiranous lawes, exceeding  the strictest rules of marishall discipline, which lawes were sent over  by Sir Thomas Dale to Sir Thomas Smith by the hande of Mr. William  Starchey,[GG] then Secretarie to the State, and were retorned in print,  with approbation, for our future government, as in divers bookes yet  extant more fully appeareth.    [GG] Mr. Strachey, sailed with Lord Delaware on the 1st of April, 1610,  and arrived at the Capes on the 15th of May. He remained about two  years. He left a well written manuscript account of his observations,  with this title: \"The Historie of travaile into Virginia Brittania,  * * * gathered and discovered as well by those who went first hither, as  collected by William Strachey, Gent., the first secretary of the  Colony;\" which, edited by R.A. Major, Esq., of the British Museum, was  published by the Hakluyt society in 1849.    At Michaellmas then next followinge, Sir Thomas Dale removed himself  with three hundred persons for the buildinge of Henrico Towne, where  being landed he oppressed his whole companye with such extraordinarye  labors by daye and watchinge by night, as maye seeme incredible to the  eares of any who had not the experimentall triall thereof. Wante of  houses at first landinge in the colde of winter, and pinchinge hunger  continually bitinge, made those imposed labours moft insufferable, and  the best fruits and effects therof to be noe better then the slaughter  of his Majesty's free subjects by starveinge, hangeinge, burneinge,  breakinge upon the wheele and shootinge to deathe, some (more than halfe  famished) runninge to the Indians to gett reliefe beinge againe retorned  were burnt to death. Some for stealinge to satisfie their hunger were  hanged, and one chained to a tree till he starved to death; others  attemptinge to run awaye in a barge and a shallop (all the Boates that  were then in the Collonye) and therin to adventure their lives for their  native countrye, beinge discovered and prevented, were shott to death,  hanged and broken upon the wheele, besides continuall whippings,  extraordinary punishments, workinge as slaves in irons for terme of  yeares (and that for petty offences) weare dayly executed. Many famished  in holes and other poore cabbins in the grounde, not respected because  sicknes had disabled them for labour, nor was their sufficient for them  that were more able to worke, our best allowance beinge but nine ounces  of corrupt and putrified meale and haife a pinte of oatmeale or pease  (of like ill condition) for each person a daye. Those provisions were  sent over by one Winne, a Draper, and Caswell, a baker, by the  appointment (as we conceave) of Sir Thomas Smith. Under this Tiranus  Government the Collony continued in extreame slavery and miserye for the  space of five yeares, in which time many, whose necessities enforced the  breach of those lawes by the strictness and severitye therof, suffered  death and other punishments. Divers gentlemen both there and at Henrico  towne, and throughout the wholl Collonye (beinge great adventurers and  no trendes or alliance to Sir Thomas Smith) weare feeling members of  those generall calamities, as far forth as the meanest fellow sent over.    The buildings and fortifications of that Towne, or thereabouts, were noe  way extraordinary, neither could want, accompanied with bloode and  crueltie, effect better.    Fortification against a foreign enemy there was none, only two or three  peeces of ordenance mounted, and against a domestic noe other but a pale  inclosinge the Towne to the quantitye of foure acres, within which those  buildings that weare erected, coulde not in any man's judgement, neither  did stande above five yeares and that not without continuall  reparations; true it is that there was a Bricke Church intended to be  built, but not soe much as the foundation therof ever finished, but we  contentinge our selves with a church of wood answerable to those houses.  Many other workes of like nature weare by him donne at Henrico and the  precincts therof, but so slightly as before his departure hence, he  himself saw the ruine and desolation of most of them.    Sir Thomas Gates likewise in his time erected some buildinges in and  about James Towne, which by continuall cost in repaireinge of them doe  yet for the most part in some sort remaine.    A framed Bridge was alsoe then erected, which utterly decayed before the  end of Sir Thomas Smith's government, that being the only bridge (any  way soe to be called) that was ever in the country. At this time in all  these labours, the miserye throughout the wholl Collony, in the  scarcitye of foode was equall; which penurious and harde kinde of  liveinge, enforced and emboldened some to petition to Sir Thomas Gates  (then Governor) to grant them that favor that they might employ  themselves in husbandry, that therby they and all others by plantinge of  corne, might be better fed then those supplies of victual which were  sent from Englande woulde afforde to doe, which request of theirs was  denied unlesse they woulde paye the yearlye rent of three barrels of  corne and one monthe's worke to the Collonye, although many of them had  been imployed in the generall workes and services of the Collony from  the beginninge of the Plantation, which harde"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22600"],[0,"How to Write Clearly: Rules and Exercises on English Composition (#18)"],[1,"and    Host carried about; (44) _and_ not  meeting the procession of the    only paid no respect to it, but     Host, not only paid no respect to    laughed at those who did; (43)      it, but even laughed at those who    (30) (51) so one of the priests     did.

FOOTNOTES:    [28] The meaning is \"_his_, and therefore _the nation's_, ministers.\"  There is a kind of antithesis between \"the nation\" and \"the nation's  ministers.\"    [29] No instance has yet been mentioned.    [30] The thought that is implied, and should be expressed, by the  words, is this: \"Cromwell's favourite ally was a free country.\"    [31] The remarks about Christina are a digression, and Burnet is now  returning to the respect in which Cromwell was held by foreign  nations.    [32] He not only sought, but sought successfully. That \"find\" is not  necessarily implied by \"seek out\" seems proved by the use of the word  in the Authorized Version, 2 Tim. ii. 17: \"He _sought_ me _out_ very  diligently, and _found_ me.\"                                    BISHOP BUTLER.    The principal faults in this style are (_a_) a vague use of pronouns  (5), and sometimes (_b_) the use of a phrase, where a word would be  enough (47 _a_).
