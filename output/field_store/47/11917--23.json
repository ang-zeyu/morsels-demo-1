Kill you first.\" He tested the  edge of the blade with a horny thumb, then raised it.    \"Wait!\" Jason said desperately. \"You don't understand.\"    The ax swung down.    \"I'm from off-world and--\"    A solid thunk shook him as the ax buried itself in the wood next to his  head. At the last instant the man had twitched it aside. He grabbed the  front of Jason's clothes and pulled him up until their faces touched.    \"S'true?\" he shouted. \"Y'from off-world?\" His hand opened and Jason  dropped back before he could answer. The savage jumped over him, towards  the dim rear of the hut.    \"Rhes must know of this,\" he said as he fumbled with something on the  wall. Light sprang out.    All Jason could do was stare. The hairy, fur-covered savage was  operating a communicator. The calloused, dirt-encrusted fingers deftly  snapped open the circuits, dialed a number.          XVI.      It made no sense. Jason tried to reconcile the modern machine with the  barbarian and couldn't. Who was he calling? The existence of one  communicator meant there was at least another. Was Rhes a person or a  thing?    With a mental effort he grabbed hold of his thoughts and braked them to  a stop. There was something new here, factors he hadn't counted on. He  kept reassuring himself there was an explanation for everything, once  you had your facts straight.    Jason closed his eyes, shutting out the glaring rays of the sun where it  cut through the tree tops, and reconsidered his facts. They separated  evenly into two classes; those he had observed for himself, and those he  had learned from the city dwellers. This last class of \"facts\" he would  hold, to see if they fitted with what he learned. There was a good  chance that most, or all, of them would prove false.    \"Get up,\" the voice jarred into his thoughts. \"We're leaving.\"    His legs were still numb and hardly usable. The bearded man snorted in  disgust and hauled him to his feet, propping him against the outer wall.  Jason clutched the knobby bark of the logs when he was left alone. He  looked around, soaking up impressions.    It was the first time he had been on a farm since he had run away from  home. A different world with a different ecology, but the similarity was  apparent enough to him. A new-sown field stretched down the hill in  front of the shack. Ploughed by a good farmer. Even, well cast furrows  that followed the contour of the slope. Another, larger log building was  next to this one, probably a barn.    There was a snuffling sound behind him and Jason turned quickly--and  froze. His hand called for the missing gun and his finger tightened down  on a trigger that wasn't there.    It had come out of the jungle and padded up quietly behind him. It had  six thick legs with clawed feet that dug into the ground. The two-meter  long body was covered with matted yellow and black fur, all except the  skull and shoulders. These were covered with overlapping horny plates.  Jason could see all this because the beast was that close.    He waited to die.    The mouth opened, a froglike division of the hairless skull, revealing  double rows of jagged teeth.    \"Here, Fido,\" the bearded man said, coming up behind Jason and snapping  his fingers at the same time. The thing bounded forward, brushing past  the dazed Jason, and rubbed his head against the man's leg. \"Nice  doggy,\" the man said, his fingers scratching under the edge of the  carapace where it joined the flesh.    The bearded man had brought two of the riding animals out of the barn,  saddled and bridled. Jason barely noticed the details of smooth skin and  long legs as he swung up on one. His feet were quickly lashed to the  stirrups. When they started the skull-headed beast followed them.    \"Nice doggy!\" Jason said, and for no reason started to laugh. The  bearded man turned and scowled at him until he was quiet.           *       *       *       *       *    By the time they entered the jungle it was dark. It was impossible to  see under the thick foliage, and they used no lights. The animals seemed  to know the way. There were scraping noises and shrill calls from the  jungle around them, but it didn't bother Jason too much. Perhaps the  automatic manner in which the other man undertook the journey reassured  him. Or the presence of the \"dog\" that he felt rather than saw. The trip  was a long one, but not too uncomfortable.    The regular motion of the animal and his fatigue overcame Jason and he  dozed into a fitful sleep, waking with a start each time he slumped  forward. In the end he slept sitting up in the saddle. Hours passed this  way, until he opened his eyes and saw a square of light before them. The  trip was over.    His legs were stiff and galled with saddle sores. After his feet were  untied getting down was an effort, and he almost fell. A door opened  and Jason went in. It took his eyes some moments to get used to the  light, until he could make out the form of a man on the bed before him.    [Illustration]    \"Come over here and sit down.\" The voice was full and strong, accustomed  to command. The body was that of an invalid. A blanket covered him to  the waist, above that the flesh was sickly white, spotted with red  nodules, and hung loosely over the bones. There seemed to be nothing  left of the man except skin and skeleton.    \"Not very nice,\" the man on the bed said, \"but I've grown used to it.\"  His tone changed abruptly. \"Naxa said you were from off-world. Is that  true?\"    Jason nodded yes, and his answer stirred the living skeleton to life.  The head lifted from the pillow and the red-rimmed eyes sought his with  a desperate intensity.    \"My name is Rhes and I'm a ... grubber. Will you help me?\"    Jason wondered at the intensity of Rhes' question, all out of proportion  to the simple content of its meaning. Yet he could see no reason to give  anything other than the first and obvious answer that sprang to his  lips.    \"Of course I'll help you, in whatever way I can. As long as it involves  no injury to anyone else. What do you want?\"    The sick man's head had fallen back limply, exhausted, as Jason talked.  But the fire still burned in the eyes.    \"Feel assured ... I want to injure no others,\" Rhes said. \"Quite the  opposite. As you see I am suffering from a disease that our remedies  will not stop. Within a few more days I will be dead. Now I have  seen ... the city people ... using a device, they press it over a  wound or an animal bite. Do you have one of these machines?\"    \"That sounds like a description of the medikit.\" Jason touched the  button at his waist that dropped the medikit into his hand. \"I have mine  here. It analyzes and treats most ...\"    \"Would you use it on me?\" Rhes broke in, his voice suddenly urgent.    \"I'm sorry,\" Jason said. \"I should have realized.\" He stepped forward  and pressed the machine over one of the inflamed areas on Rhes' chest.  The operation light came on and the thin shaft of the analyzer probe  slid down. When it withdrew the device hummed, then clicked three times  as three separate hypodermic needles lanced into the skin. Then the  light went out.    \"Is that all?\" Rhes asked, as he watched Jason stow the medikit back in  his belt.    Jason nodded, then looked up and noticed the wet marks of tears on the  sick man's face. Rhes became aware at the same time and brushed at them  angrily.    \"When a man is sick,\" he growled, \"the body and all its senses become  traitor. I don't think I have cried since I was a child--but you must  realize it's not myself I'm crying for. It's the untold thousands of my  people who have died for lack of that little device you treat so  casually.\"    \"Surely you have medicines, doctors of your own?\"    \"Herb doctors and witch doctors,\" Rhes said, consigning them all to  oblivion with a chop of his hand. \"The few hard-working and honest men  are hampered by the fact that the faith healers can usually cure better  than their strongest potion.\"    The talking had tired Rhes. He stopped suddenly and closed his eyes. On  his chest, the inflamed areas were already losing their angry color as  the injections took affect. Jason glanced around the room, looking for  clues to the mystery of these people.           *       *       *       *       *    Floor and walls were made of wood lengths fitted together, free of paint  or decoration. They looked simple and crude, fit only for the savages  he had expected to meet. Or were they crude? The wood had a sweeping,  flamelike grain. When he bent close he saw that wax had been rubbed over  the wood to bring out this pattern. Was this the act of savages--or of  artistic men seeking to make the most of simple materials? The final  effect was far superior to the drab paint and riveted steel rooms of the  city-dwelling Pyrrans. Wasn't it true that both ends of the artistic  scale were dominated by simplicity? The untutored aborigine made a  simple expression of a clear idea, and created beauty. At the other  extreme, the sophisticated critic rejected over-elaboration and  decoration and sought the truthful clarity of uncluttered art. At which  end of the scale was he looking now?    These men were savages, he had been told that. They dressed in furs and  spoke a slurred and broken language, at least Naxa did. Rhes admitted he  preferred faith healers to doctors. But, if all this were true, where  did the communicator fit into the picture? Or the glowing ceiling that  illuminated the room with a soft light?    Rhes opened his eyes and stared at Jason, as if seeing him for the first  time. \"Who are you?\" he asked. \"And what are you doing here?\"    There was a cold menace in his words and Jason understood why. The city  Pyrrans hated the \"grubbers\" and, without a doubt, the feeling was  mutual. Naxa's ax had proved that.

Sanford Bell has published cases in which as early  as the age of two years psychosexual phenomena have been observed. But  in many of Bell's cases a sexual basis for the feelings of attraction  does not appear to have been adequately proved to exist. Unquestionably,  however, sexual phenomena are more frequently observed in proportion as  the child's age increases. Although in the case of children it is very  difficult for others to arrive at certainty regarding the sexual or  non-sexual character of certain manifestations, still, in the eighth  year of life, the phenomena of the contrectation impulse become so  frequent--I am referring here to personal observations--that at this  time of life these phenomena must be regarded, not merely as not  pathological, but further, as not even abnormal. The older the child  becomes, the more are the phenomena of the contrectation impulse  complicated by those of detumescence. The processes of contrectation,  however, may continue to manifest themselves during the first years of  the period of youth in complete isolation from any apparent changes in  the genital organs. The manifestations of what is known as \"calf-love\"  commonly occur quite independently of any thought of sexual contact.    Very various are the objects of this early attraction. Often a boy is  attracted by a girl of about his own age; often, again, by a girl  considerably older than himself. On the other hand, as has been  previously shown, when the sexual attraction felt by the boy is  exhibited towards one of his own sex, it may sometimes happen that the  object of attraction is a boy of his own age, sometimes a man  considerably older than himself. By no means rare are sexual  inclinations on the part of boys towards their masters--in some cases a  private tutor; in others, a schoolmaster. With girls similar variations  are observed. A girl may love another girl of her own age, and this is  extremely common in the case of girls at boarding-schools. But a boy, a  friend of her brother's, may be the object of a girl's affection.  Frequently, again, a girl may become attached to some one considerably  older than herself, commonly a master or a governess. Persons playing  some conspicuous part in life very readily inspire love: an artist, for  instance; or an actress, about whom all the papers are writing, and of  whom everyone is talking. In many cases, the personal appearance plays a  considerable part in originating the attraction. At times, indeed,  affection is inspired by individuals devoid of all personal charm. But,  speaking generally, we shall find that to the child, no less than to the  adult, in sexual relationships beauty is by no means indifferent. A  pretty girl is more attractive to a boy than an ugly one. A handsome  master will charm a girl much more than one who is ill-favoured or  deformed. Other qualities besides beauty affect the issue. Effeminate  boys or tomboyish girls are apt to be repulsive to other children; they  are exposed to mockery and teasing of all kinds, and are very unlikely  to give rise to erotic sentiments in their companions. It is by no means  rare for the inclinations of children to be directed towards their own  parents. In the case of many children who are fond of \"getting into  mother's bed,\" sexual sentiments lie at the root of the desire.  Moreover, it is occasionally asserted that sexual differentiation  manifests itself in this connexion in very early childhood, the little  boy preferring to cuddle his mother; the little girl, on the other hand,  to be caressed by her father. In the chapter on diagnosis, I shall  consider the distinction of such sexual inclinations from other  sympathetic feelings manifested in childhood. It is a remarkable fact  that the first sexual inclinations are very rarely directed towards a  child's own brother or sister. I have, indeed, been able to observe a  considerable number of such exceptional instances, both homosexual and  heterosexual in character. But, I repeat, such cases are comparatively  rare. We must not, of course, confuse with genuine sexual inclinations  and acts, cases in which from curiosity alone brothers and sisters  indulge together in obscene conversation and even improper practices.  Unquestionably, the lack of sexual sympathy between brothers and sisters  depends upon a deeply rooted psychological causation. Above all, in this  connexion, we have to bear in mind the slight degree of influence each  exercises on the senses of the other, precisely in consequence of the  long-continued, comparatively unrestrained intercourse between them.  Further, the conventional factors implanted in mankind from earliest  childhood play their part. Many, perhaps, will see an additional cause  in teleological considerations, aiming at the avoidance of in-and-in  breeding.    Many lovers incline to the romantic transfiguration of the object of  their affection, a process in which the imagination plays an important  part; but for this to be possible, it is, of course, necessary that an  age should have been attained at which the imagination is sufficiently  active. The age at which the child has learned to delight in fairy-tales  is here of importance; from the contents of such fairy-tales all kinds  of ideas are transferred to the sexual sphere. Romantic embellishment  plays a great part not merely in childhood, but also later in life; but  in childhood, this tendency often exists to an extraordinary degree. The  person whom a boy loves must be very highly placed; for example, during  the period of the undifferentiated sexual impulse, he prefers a boy of  the highest possible birth. Similarly, a young girl who loves a boy will  invest him in imagination with every possible attribute of distinction  and high rank. Often the love is directed towards a person of no  concrete existence, or towards one who is unattainable.[35] We may  sometimes be in doubt whether we have to do with sexual love, or whether  some other sentiment may not be in operation. For example, the devotion  to some saint of either sex may overpower all other feelings. Where a  child is enamoured of some definite individual, self-deception occurs  just as it does in adults similarly situated. The faults of the beloved  one are imaginatively transmuted into virtues, or any possible excuse is  found for them. Is a boy attracted by a girl known to be habitually  untruthful? Especially when himself unaware that his interest is sexual,  he looks out for every merit she may possibly possess, in order that his  fondness may be justified. Her untruthfulness is transfigured as caution  and cleverness; her vanity becomes neatness; idleness is excused on the  ground that she has to attend to more important duties; and the boy  regards his interest in the girl as exclusively friendly in character,  and as justified by her superlative excellences. Sometimes, in children  no less than in adults, a sexual inclination masquerades as an  educational interest. Thus, under the influence of sexual attraction, a  girl becomes intimate with a boy endowed with various bad qualities and  impulses, and endeavours to utilise this intimacy for the boy's  advantage, in order that he may free himself of his faults as he grows  to manhood. Such a girl may succeed in persuading herself that this  motive is the exclusive cause of her interest in the boy. A similar  combination of educational and sexual motives is, moreover, often  encountered in the case of homosexual sentiments.    The child's sexual inclination may manifest itself in many different  ways. It seeks every opportunity of seeing, of being in close proximity  to, of touching, and of kissing the beloved person. Thus, many a boy  takes part in the common sports, solely because the girl whom he loves  is one of the players. Sanford Bell mentions numerous games in which  children find pleasure chiefly for the reason that kissing plays a  principal part in them. For kissing is one of the leading manifestations  of sexual desire; and another is the wish for close proximity to and for  embracing the beloved person. A mother who kept a close watch on her  eight-year-old daughter told me that when in play a boy of ten pressed  close up against the girl; they kissed one another somewhat  passionately, and the boy broke out in the naive utterance, \"You don't  know how fond I am of you; I do love you so.\" Not infrequently, indeed,  children are really troublesome to adults in their desire for close  physical contact. I have known instances in which young women or girls  have been intolerably annoyed by boys eight or nine years of age, who  have continually followed them about and pressed up against them; this  has gone on for a long time without those concerned recognising the  sexual foundation of such conduct. Love on the part of children almost  invariably gives rise to the desire for physical contact of some kind.  Of course, other manifestations also occur. Besides the contemplation of  the beloved person, contemplation of his or her picture plays a notable  part. A sexual motive occasionally underlies the wrestling so common  among boys--in such cases it is the manifestation of a desire for  intimate physical contact with the beloved boy. According to Sanford  Bell, a boy and a girl may also wrestle with one another with the same  end in view of attaining intimate contact; and he states that children  lift one another with the same object. Moreover, children are induced to  wrestle by sexual motives of a somewhat different character; the wish is  operative to be overcome by, or, it may be, to overcome, the beloved  boy. Herein we see displayed very clearly those sexual feelings known to  us in adults under the names of masochism and sadism; the same feelings  are occasionally observed also in childhood; in some cases as  manifestations of the undifferentiated"]]]
