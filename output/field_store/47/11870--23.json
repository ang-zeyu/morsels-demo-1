I suggested--\"no\"--\"Say the last word again.\" \"er!\"  She kept harping on the same word--Ehre = honour: there could be no  further doubt about this, for the missing \"h\" was of no importance  since I had taught her to spell all words according to their sound  only--as there would have been no object in teaching her _our_  orthography, embodying, as it does, so much that is cumbersome and  superfluous.    21 December: Lola was still in the same broken condition: she had been  off after the game since about mid-day on the 20th, and had only  returned home in the evening. I addressed her with evident displeasure  in my voice, saying: \"Have you any excuse to make for such behaviour?\"  \"Yes.\" \"Then what is it?\" \"ich one er.\" ( = I am without honour). \"But,  Lola! you are only making things worse--if you are naughty and go off  like this after the game!\" \"zu schwer zu leben!\" ( = too difficult to  live!). \"Lola! how can honour be made good again?\" \"wen ich sterbe!\" (  = if I die!) ... and here the \"romance\" ended (but not Lola's life!).  After a few days she got better and soon became as lively as ever--the  wild and excitable creature she is by nature, whom none would take to  be the mother of four children--and a \"learned dog\"--into the bargain!  The thing is--could the dog have caught up an _impression_ from some  human mind--something she had heard said in conversation, and which she  had--in some mysterious way--assimilated and applied to her own life? I  cannot tell, but I almost feel as if this must have been the case.  There can be no doubt that animals _have_ a sense of honour, yet it  would seem unlikely for it to function in the manner above narrated.  Yet how much remains still unaccounted for within a dog's soul--how  many attempts at unravelling will have to be made before the right  clues have been touched, which shall lead us to our goal within this  labyrinth. There is so much which it is impossible to bring into  co-ordination with the human psyche, for though there are many  fundamental impulses, common to both man and beast, we cannot approach  the subject, nor yet measure it according to our human standards, where  the psychology of a dog is in question. Another thing: in educating  these dogs specially reared for experimental work--we should be careful  on no account to suppress those instincts, which are natural to them as  _dogs_--i.e. their \"dog-individuality,\" transforming this--either by  praise or blame. Just as certain conceptions and feelings, held by  different peoples differ fundamentally, so too, has every animal a  _something_ which is _its very own_, an _innate something_, and  this--in order to successfully accomplish our ends--must be held  inviolate. Now, this is, of course, very difficult--since to instruct  and educate an animal is, of itself, an infringement on its true  nature--and, indeed, the same might be said respecting the life it  leads among human beings. Yet I believe that where an animal _feels_  that its own inner nature is left unmolested we may often succeed in  \"_hearing the animal speak within the animal_\" (if I may so put it),  rather than its \"human connexion.\" That sentence of Lola's: \"wegen  ihren Augen und Sorgen ohne Ruhe\" ( = because of their eyes and their  sorrows without ceasing) certainly \"rang true\"--one could feel it as  the answer was being given--yet--where the meaning is dubious, as in  some of her replies which followed this one, decision becomes difficult  indeed!          THE CONNEXION OF IDEAS      The ability to definitely connect one idea with another is clearly  apparent in the animal mind, and may be attributed to its excellent  memory and powers of attention. In everyday-life this becomes apparent  as the reflex of their experiences, the impressions of which, having  once impinged on their sensibility have left their mark, so to speak,  and this experience thus practically acquired, shows itself at times as  the shrewdest of wisdom, even though we may now know how their \"power  of reasoning\" was arrived at--without words. We need only think of the  way in which animals have time and again rescued their masters--going  for assistance in the most intelligent way--this being but one of the  many examples which occur to my mind. Nevertheless, a combination of  thoughts, such as is carried out purely on the _mental_ plane is only  possible in the case of an animal that has been trained. I had a very  pretty example of this on 14 September, 1916. I had taken Lola with me  to a neighbouring estate. The rain was coming down in torrents, and we  sat beneath the sheltering roof of the balcony and gazed out at this  flood. \"Where does the rain come from--Lola?\" I asked; \"uzu,\" she  replied. \"And what does that mean?\" I queried. \"heaven.\" \"And what is  the water wanted for?\" She hesitated and tapped--\"ich zu taun!\" \"What  does _taun_ mean? tell me differently!\" (as I thought she was evading a  direct answer). \"funo!\" \"Nonsense!\" \"yes!\" \"I want to know what _taun_  means!\" \"when I don't hear!\" \"Nonsense! '_when you don't hear!_'--there  is some letter wrong!\" \"yes.\" \"What should it be?\" \"b.\" \"Taub?\" ( =  deaf). \"yes.\"    A week earlier I had explained \"eyes\" and \"ears\" to her, and the  meaning of blindness and deafness, and yet could not make out why she  was now using the word \"taub\" in this connexion.    \"Did you mean that you did not understand me?\" \"no.\" \"Then why did you  say that?\" \"ich er (rather reluctantly) ... or ...\" \"Well----? and what  more?\" \"I won't say!\" \"You won't tell me?\" \"yes!\" The next day I  returned to this question, for I could not make out why she gave me  such answers, and made such excuses. She well knew how determined I  could be in the matter of \"catechising,\" and that I will stand no  \"nonsense\" when she begins her little game of rapping \"1!\"--the meaning  of which, she had once informed me, was \"_I won't tell!_\" and the  sequel to which I generally found to be that she would put me off with  any word that might just happen to come into her head. But why had this  remark occurred to her yesterday? I wanted to get to the bottom of it,  so returning to the attack, said: \"Why wouldn't you tell me yesterday  what water is good for?\" \"I thought of ear!\" \"What has water to do with  'ear'?\" \"water in ear horrid!\" Here, then, was the reason! In her very  fear she had not been able to bring forth her true answer--for, owing  to me, the water had got into her ears--and made this lasting and  unpleasant impression--when she was being bathed--or when I threw her  into a stream! The reader may already have noticed other instances  where a direct connexion of ideas has occurred. I have purposely  abstained from pointing to the obvious in each case, believing that  anyone who is keenly interested will do so quickly enough for himself,  and I am loth to weary my Public by needless repetitions.          SPONTANEOUS REPLIES      Spontaneous replies provide a special proof of this ability to form  independent thoughts, and is found both among horses and dogs. Such a  reply is indeed the sudden and evident utterance of some thought, and  of a thought which--to it--transcends all other thoughts at the moment:  one which regardless of all other questions which may at the time be  put to it, looms largest, and the animal will therefore utter this  remark, asked or unasked--and quite independently of any question, but  more after the manner of \"making an observation.\" Such a thought may  have nothing to do with the subject in hand, and persons who are  participating in this conversation _a deux_, can only arrive at the  inference of ideas after having carefully thought the matter over--it  may also be that they will fail to see any association of ideas at all.  Now, it is indisputable that such replies belong to the most important  category--for they may serve as proofs to those who themselves have not  worked with animals for any length of time, and who, therefore, cannot  become sincerely convinced as to the truth of the matter by travelling  the longer road of personal test and experience. The teacher of any  horse or dog of good parts does not need this proof: there are  thousands of small instances which in their sum total prove  important--trivial and uncertain though each one may be, when regarded  by itself. It would be difficult to know how to convey these to anyone  in words: glances, movements, a certain \"live appeal\"--it would require  a poet to catch and fix--in short--to idealize--telling us the true  inwardness, so that we might indeed comprehend ... and even then he  would, I fear, make for weariness, when grappling with what well may  seem interminable.[20] Here are a few examples:          [20] The poet, Hans Mueller, has touched most eloquently on the        power to think latent in animals in his book, \"Die Kunst sich zu        freuen.\"    16 May, 1916: Lola was doing arithmetic and I had given her some new  sums.

SIR THOMAS FOWELL BUXTON, BART., AND HIS DOG \"SPEAKER.\"    Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton was very fond of dogs; his son[59] tells an  anecdote of the singular manner in which one of his pets came into his  possession. \"He was standing at the door of the House of Commons talking  to a friend, when a beautiful black and tan terrier rushed between them,  and immediately began barking furiously at Mr Joseph Pease, who was  speaking. All the members jumped up, shouting and laughing, while the  officers of the house chased the dog round and round, till at last he  took refuge with Mr Buxton, who, as he could find no traces of an owner,  carried him home. He proved to be quite an original. One of his whims  was, that he would never go into the kitchen nor yet into a poor man's  cottage; but he formed a habit of visiting by himself at the country  houses in the neighbourhood of Cromer, and his refined manners and  intelligence made 'Speaker' a welcome guest wherever he pleased to go.\"      LORD BYRON AND HIS DOG BOATSWAIN.    In November 1808 Lord Byron lost his favourite dog Boatswain; the poor  animal having been seized with a fit of madness, at the commencement of  which so little aware was Byron of the nature of the malady, that he  more than once, with his bare hand, wiped away the slaver from the dog's  lips during the paroxysms. In a letter to his friend Mr Hodson, he thus  announces this event:--\"Boatswain is dead! he expired in a state of  madness on the 18th, after suffering much, yet retaining all the  gentleness of his nature to the last, never attempting to do the least  injury to any one near him. I have now lost everything except old  Murray.\"    The monument raised by him to this dog--the most memorable tribute of  the kind since the dog's grave, of old, at Salamis--is still a  conspicuous ornament of the gardens of Newstead. The misanthropic verses  engraved upon it may be found among his poems, and the following is the  inscription by which they are introduced:--                 \"Near this spot Are deposited the remains of one Who     possessed beauty without vanity, Strength without insolence, Courage     without ferocity, And all the virtues of man without his vices. This     praise, which would be unmeaning flattery If inscribed over human ashes,     Is but a just tribute to the memory of BOATSWAIN, a dog, Who was born at     Newfoundland, May 1803, And died at Newstead Abbey, November 18, 1805.\"    The poet Pope, when about the same age as the writer of this  inscription, passed a similar eulogy on his dog, at the expense of human  nature; adding that \"histories are more full of examples of the fidelity  of dogs than of friends.\" In a still sadder and bitterer spirit, Lord  Byron writes of his favourite:--       \"To mark a friend's remains these stones arise;     I never knew but _one_, and _here_ he lies.\"[60]    Moore relates a story of this dog, indicative, not only of intelligence,  but of a generosity of spirit, which might well win for him the  affections of such a master as Byron. A fox-terrier of his mother's,  called Gilpin, was an object of dislike to Boatswain, who worried him  nearly to the death. Gilpin was sent off and Boatswain was missed for a  day. To the surprise of the servants, towards evening Gilpin and  Boatswain were in company, the former led by the latter, who led him to  the kitchen fire, licked him and lavished on him every possible  demonstration of joy. He had been away to fetch him, and ever after  caressed him, and defended him from the attacks of other dogs. (P. 44.)      \"PERCHANCE\"--A LADY'S _reason_ FOR SO NAMING HER DOG.    A lady had a favourite lap-dog, which she called Perchance. \"A singular  name,\" said somebody, \"for a beautiful pet, madam; where did you find  it?\"--\"Oh,\" drawled she, \"it was named from Byron's dog. You remember  where he says, '_Perchance_ my dog will howl.'\"[61]      COLLINS THE ARTIST AND HIS DOG \"PRINNY\"--A MODEL OF \"_a model_.\"    William Wilkie Collins, after a most graphic account of the companions  of his artist-father's home,[62] notices \"one who was ever as ready to  offer his small aid and humble obedience as were any of his superiors,  to confer the benefit of their penetrating advice.\" I refer to Mr  Collins's dog \"Prinny\" (Prince). This docile and affectionate animal had  been trained by his master to sit in any attitude, which the  introduction of a dog in his picture (a frequent occurrence) might  happen to demand. So strict was \"Prinny's\" sense of duty, that he never  ventured to move from his set position until his master's signal gave  him permission to approach his chair, when he was generally rewarded  with a lump of sugar, placed, not between his teeth, but on his nose,  where he continued to balance it, until he was desired to throw it into  the air and catch it in his mouth, a feat which he very seldom failed to  perform. On one occasion his extraordinary integrity in the performance  of his duties was thus pleasantly exemplified:--\"My father had placed  him on the backs of two chairs, his fore-legs on the rails of one, and  his hind-legs on the rails of the other; and in this rather arduous  position had painted from him for a considerable time, when a friend was  announced as waiting for him in another apartment. Particularly desirous  of seeing this visitor immediately, the painter hurried from the room,  entirely forgetting to tell 'Prinny' to get down, and remained in  conversation with his friend for full half an hour. On returning to his  study the first object that greeted him was poor 'Prinny,' standing on  his 'bad eminence' exactly in the position in which he had been left,  trembling with fatigue, and occasionally vending his anguish and  distress in a low piteous moan, but not moving a limb, or venturing even  to turn his head. Not having received the usual signal he had never once  attempted to get down, but had remained disconsolate in his position  'sitting' hard, with nobody to paint him, during the long half hour that  had delayed his master's return.\"      THE SOLDIER AND THE MASTIFF.    A soldier passing through a meadow, a large mastiff ran at him, and he  stabbed the dog with a bayonet. The master of the dog asked him why he  had not rather struck the dog with the butt-end of his weapon? \"So I  should,\" said the soldier, \"if he had run at me with his tail!\"[63]      BARK AND BITE.    Lord Clare, who was much opposed to Curran, one day brought a  Newfoundland dog upon the bench, and during Curran's speech turned  himself aside and caressed the animal. Curran stopped. \"Go on, go on, Mr  Curran,\" said Lord Clare.--\"Oh, I beg a thousand pardons,\" was the  rejoinder. \"I really thought your lordship was employed in  _consultation_.\"[64]      MRS DREW AND THE TWO DOGS.    (A CURIOUSLY NEAR APPROACH TO MORAL PERCEPTION.)    In the biography of Samuel Drew, A.M., a great name among the  metaphysical writers of this country, we read a very interesting  anecdote of two dogs.    His father, a farmer and mail-carrier in Cornwall, had procured a  Newfoundland dog for protection on his journeys, having been attacked by  highwaymen. There was a smaller dog which had been bred in the house.  The son was living at Poplea, in Cornwall, when the following  circumstance occurred, and he witnessed it:[65]--    \"Our dairy was under a room which was used occasionally as a barn and  apple-chamber, into which the fowls sometimes found their way; and, in  scratching among the chaff, scattered the dust on the pans of milk  below, to the great annoyance of my mother-in-law. In this a favourite  cock of hers was the chief transgressor. One day in harvest she went  into the dairy, followed by the little dog, and finding dust again on  her milk-pans, she exclaimed, 'I wish that cock were dead!' Not long  after, she being with us in the harvest field, we observed the little  dog dragging along the cock, just killed, which, with an air of triumph,  he laid at my mother-in-law's feet. Highly exasperated at the literal  fulfilment of her hastily-uttered wish, she snatched a stick from the  hedge, and attempted to give the dog a beating. The luckless animal,  seeing the"]]]
