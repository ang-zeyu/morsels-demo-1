Their request was refused, the Hungarians  exulting that they held the Doge of Venice prisoner in Treviso. But  Dolfino, with a body of two hundred horse, cut his way through their  lines by night, and reached Mestre (Malghera) in safety, where he was  met by the Senate. His bravery could not avert the misfortunes which  were accumulating on the republic. The Hungarian war was ignominiously  terminated by the surrender of Dalmatia: the Doge's heart was broken,  his eyesight failed him, and he died of the plague four years after he  had ascended the throne.    Sec. LXIII. It is perhaps on this account, perhaps in consequence of later  injuries, that the tomb has neither effigy nor inscription: that it has  been subjected to some violence is evident from the dentil which once  crowned its leaf-cornice being now broken away, showing the whole front.  But, fortunately, the sculpture of the sarcophagus itself is little  injured.    There are two saints, male and female, at its angles, each in a little  niche; a Christ, enthroned in the centre, the Doge and Dogaressa  kneeling at his feet; in the two intermediate panels, on one side the  Epiphany, on the other the Death of the Virgin; the whole supported, as  well as crowned, by an elaborate leaf-plinth. The figures under the  niches are rudely cut, and of little interest. Not so the central group.  Instead of a niche, the Christ is seated under a square tent, or  tabernacle, formed by curtains running on rods; the idea, of course, as  usual, borrowed from the Pisan one, but here ingeniously applied. The  curtains are opened in front, showing those at the back of the tent,  behind the seated figure; the perspective of the two retiring sides  being very tolerably suggested. Two angels, of half the size of the  seated figure, thrust back the near curtains, and look up reverently to  the Christ; while again, at their feet, about one third of _their_ size,  and half-sheltered, as it seems, by their garments, are the two kneeling  figures of the Doge and Dogaressa, though so small and carefully cut,  full of life. The Christ raising one hand as to bless, and holding a  book upright and open on the knees, does not look either towards them or  to the angels, but forward; and there is a very noticeable effort to  represent Divine abstraction in the countenance: the idea of the three  magnitudes of spiritual being,--the God, the Angel, and the Man,--is  also to be observed, aided as it is by the complete subjection of the  angelic power to the Divine; for the angels are in attitudes of the most  lowly watchfulness of the face of Christ, and appear unconscious of the  presence of the human beings who are nestled in the folds of their  garments.    Sec. LXIV. With this interesting but modest tomb of one of the kings  of Venice, it is desirable to compare that of one of her senators, of  exactly the same date, which is raised against the western wall of the  Frari, at the end of the north aisle. It bears the following remarkable  inscription:     \"ANNO MCCCLX. prima die Julii Sepultura . Domini . Simonii Dandolo .     amador . de . Justisia . e . desiroso . de . acrese . el . ben .     chomum.\"    The \"Amador de Justitia\" has perhaps some reference to Simon Dandolo's  having been one of the Giunta who condemned the Doge Faliero. The  sarcophagus is decorated merely by the Annunciation group, and an  enthroned Madonna with a curtain behind her throne, sustained by four  tiny angels, who look over it as they hold it up; but the workmanship of  the figures is more than usually beautiful.    Sec. LXV. Seven years later, a very noble monument was placed on the  north side of the choir of St. John and Paul, to the Doge Marco Cornaro,  chiefly, with respect to our present subject, noticeable for the absence  of religious imagery from the sarcophagus, which is decorated with  roses only; three very beautiful statues of the Madonna and two saints  are, however, set in the canopy above. Opposite this tomb, though about  fifteen years later in date, is the richest monument of the Gothic  period in Venice; that of the Doge Michele Morosini, who died in 1382.  It consists of a highly florid canopy,--an arch crowned by a gable, with  pinnacles at the flanks, boldly crocketed, and with a huge finial at the  top representing St. Michael,--a medallion of Christ set in the gable;  under the arch, a mosaic, representing the Madonna presenting the Doge  to Christ upon the cross; beneath, as usual, the sarcophagus, with a  most noble recumbent figure of the Doge, his face meagre and severe, and  sharp in its lines, but exquisite in the form of its small and princely  features. The sarcophagus is adorned with elaborate wrinkled leafage,  projecting in front of it into seven brackets, from which the statues  are broken away; but by which, for there can be no doubt that these last  statues represented the theological and cardinal Virtues, we must for a  moment pause.    Sec. LXVI. It was noticed above, that the tomb of the Florentine  ambassador, Duccio, was the first in Venice which presented images of  the Virtues. Its small lateral statues of Justice and Temperance are  exquisitely beautiful, and were, I have no doubt, executed by a  Florentine sculptor; the whole range of artistical power and religious  feeling being, in Florence, full half a century in advance of that of  Venice. But this is the first truly Venetian tomb which has the Virtues;  and it becomes of importance, therefore, to know what was the character  of Morosini.    The reader must recollect, that I dated the commencement of the fall of  Venice from the death of Carlo Zeno, considering that no state could be  held as in decline, which numbered such a man amongst its citizens.  Carlo Zeno was a candidate for the Ducal bonnet together with Michael  Morosini; and Morosini was chosen. It might be anticipated, therefore,  that there was something more than usually admirable or illustrious in  his character. Yet it is difficult to arrive at a just estimate of it,  as the reader will at once understand by comparing the following  statements:       Sec. LXVI. 1. \"To him (Andrea Contarini) succeeded Morosini, at the     age    of seventy-four years; a most learned and prudent man, who also     reformed several laws.\"--_Sansovino_, Vite de' Principi.       2. \"It was generally believed that, if his reign had been longer, he     would have dignified the state by many noble laws and institutes; but     by so much as his reign was full of hope, by as much was it short in     duration, for he died when he had been at the head of the republic     but four months.\"--_Sabellico_, lib. viii.       3. \"He was allowed but a short time to enjoy this high dignity, which     he had so well deserved by his rare virtues, for God called him to     Himself on the 15th of October.\"--_Muratori_, Annali de' Italia.       4. \"Two candidates presented themselves; one was Zeno, the other that     Michael Morosini who, during the war, had tripled his fortune by his     speculations. The suffrages of the electors fell upon him, and he was     proclaimed Doge on the 10th of June.\"--_Daru_, Histoire de Venise,     lib. x.       5. \"The choice of the electors was directed to Michele Morosini, a     noble of illustrious birth, derived from a stock which, coeval with     the republic itself, had produced the conqueror of Tyre, given a     queen to Hungary, and more than one Doge to Venice. The brilliancy of     this descent was tarnished in the present chief representative of the     family by the most base and grovelling avarice; for at that moment,     in the recent war, at which all other Venetians were devoting their     whole fortunes to the service of the state, Morosini sought in the     distresses of his country an opening for his own private enrichment,     and employed his ducats, not in the assistance of the national wants,     but in speculating upon houses which were brought to market at a     price far beneath their real value, and which, upon the return of     peace, insured the purchaser a fourfold profit. 'What matters the     fall of Venice to me, so as I fall not together with her?' was his     selfish and sordid reply to some one who expressed surprise at the     transaction.\"--_Sketches of Venetian History_. Murray, 1831.    Sec. LXVIII. The writer of the unpretending little history from which the  last quotation is taken has not given his authority for this statement,  and I could not find it, but believed, from the general accuracy of the  book, that some authority might exist better than Daru's. Under these  circumstances, wishing if possible to ascertain the truth, and to clear  the character of this great Doge from the accusation, if it proved  groundless, I wrote to the Count Carlo Morosini, his descendant, and one  of the few remaining representatives of the ancient noblesse of Venice;  one, also, by whom his great ancestral name is revered, and in whom it  is exalted. His answer appears to me altogether conclusive as to the  utter fallacy of the reports of Daru and the English history. I have  placed his letter in the close of this volume (Appendix 6), in order  that the reader may himself be the judge upon this point; and I should  not have alluded to Daru's report, except for the purpose of  contradicting it, but that it still appears to me impossible that any  modern historian should have gratuitously invented the whole story, and  that, therefore, there must have been a trace in the documents which  Daru himself possessed, of some scandal of this kind raised by  Morosini's enemies, perhaps at the very time of the disputed election  with Carlo Zeno. The occurrence of the Virtues upon his tomb, for the  first time in Venetian monumental work, and so richly and conspicuously  placed, may partly have been in public"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30775"],[0,"Elements of Chemistry, (#18)"],[1,"gas, thirteen  times lighter than atmospheric air. By examining the water which has  been distilled, it is found to have lost 100 grs. and the 274 grs.  of iron confined in the tube are found to have acquired 85 grs.  additional weight, and its magnitude is considerably augmented. The iron  is now hardly at all attractable by the magnet; it dissolves in acids  without effervescence; and, in short, it is converted into a black oxyd,  precisely similar to that which has been burnt in oxygen gas.    In this experiment we have a true _oxydation_ of iron, by means of  water, exactly similar to that produced in air by the assistance of  heat. One hundred grains of water having been decomposed, 85 grs. of  oxygen have combined with the iron, so as to convert it into the state  of black oxyd, and 15 grs. of a peculiar inflammable gas are  disengaged: From all this it clearly follows, that water is composed of  oxygen combined with the base of an inflammable gas, in the respective  proportions of 85 parts, by weight of the former, to 15 parts of the  latter.    Thus water, besides the oxygen, which is one of its elements in common  with many other substances, contains another element as its constituent  base or radical, and for which we must find an appropriate term. None  that we could think of seemed better adapted than the word _hydrogen_,  which signifies the _generative principle of water_, from [Greek: ydor]  _aqua_, and [Greek: geinomas] _gignor_[17]. We call the combination of  this element with caloric _hydrogen gas_; and the term hydrogen  expresses the base of that gas, or the radical of water.    This experiment furnishes us with a new combustible body, or, in other  words, a body which has so much affinity with oxygen as to draw it from  its connection with caloric, and to decompose air or oxygen gas. This  combustible body has itself so great affinity with caloric, that, unless  when engaged in a combination with some other body, it always subsists  in the aeriform or gasseous state, in the usual temperature and pressure  of our atmosphere. In this state of gas it is about 1/13 of the weight  of an equal bulk of atmospheric air; it is not absorbed by water, though  it is capable of holding a small quantity of that fluid in solution, and  it is incapable of being used for respiration.    As the property this gas possesses, in common with all other combustible  bodies, is nothing more than the power of decomposing air, and carrying  off its oxygen from the caloric with which it was combined, it is easily  understood that it cannot burn, unless in contact with air or oxygen  gas. Hence, when we set fire to a bottle full of this gas, it burns  gently, first at the neck of the bottle, and then in the inside of it,  in proportion as the external air gets in: This combustion is slow and  successive, and only takes place at the surface of contact between the  two gasses. It is quite different when the two gasses are mixed before  they are set on fire: If, for instance, after having introduced one part  of oxygen gas into a narrow mouthed bottle, we fill it up with two  parts of hydrogen gas, and bring a lighted taper, or other burning body,  to the mouth of the bottle, the combustion of the two gasses takes place  instantaneously with a violent explosion. This experiment ought only to  be made in a bottle of very strong green glass, holding not more than a  pint, and wrapped round with twine, otherwise the operator will be  exposed to great danger from the rupture of the bottle, of which the  fragments will be thrown about with great force.    If all that has been related above, concerning the decomposition of  water, be exactly conformable to truth;--if, as I have endeavoured to  prove, that substance be really composed of hydrogen, as its proper  constituent element, combined with oxygen, it ought to follow, that, by  reuniting these two elements together, we should recompose water; and  that this actually happens may be judged of by the following experiment.      _Experiment Fourth._    I took a large cristal baloon, A, Pl. iv. fig. 5. holding about 30  pints, having a large opening, to which was cemented the plate of copper  BC, pierced with four holes, in which four tubes terminate. The first  tube, H h, is intended to be adapted to an air pump, by which the  baloon is to be exhausted of its air. The second tube gg, communicates,  by its extremity MM, with a reservoir of oxygen gas, with which the  baloon is to be filled. The third tube d D d', communicates, by its  extremity d NN, with a reservoir of hydrogen gas. The extremity d' of  this tube terminates in a capillary opening, through which the hydrogen  gas contained in the reservoir is forced, with a moderate degree of  quickness, by the pressure of one or two inches of water. The fourth  tube contains a metallic wire GL, having a knob at its extremity L,  intended for giving an electrical spark from L to d', on purpose to set  fire to the hydrogen gas: This wire is moveable in the tube, that we may  be able to separate the knob L from the extremity d' of the tube D d'.  The three tubes d D d', gg, and H h, are all provided with stop-cocks.    That the hydrogen gas and oxygen gas may be as much as possible deprived  of water, they are made to pass, in their way to the baloon A, through  the tubes MM, NN, of about an inch diameter, and filled with salts,  which, from their deliquescent nature, greedily attract the moisture of  the air: Such are the acetite of potash, and the muriat or nitrat of  lime[18]. These salts must only be reduced to a coarse powder, lest  they run into lumps, and prevent the gasses from geting through their  interstices.    We must be provided before hand with a sufficient quantity of oxygen  gas, carefully purified from all admixture of carbonic acid, by long  contact with a solution of potash[19].    We must likewise have a double quantity of hydrogen gas, carefully  purified in the same manner by long contact with a solution of potash in  water. The best way of obtaining this gas free from mixture is, by  decomposing water with very pure soft iron, as directed in Exp. 3. of  this chapter.    Having adjusted every thing properly, as above directed, the tube H h is  adapted to an air-pump, and the baloon A is exhausted of its air. We  next admit the oxygen gas so as to fill the baloon, and then, by means  of pressure, as is before mentioned, force a small stream of hydrogen  gas through its tube D d', which we immediately set on fire by an  electric spark. By means of the above described apparatus, we can  continue the mutual combustion of these two gasses for a long time, as  we have the power of supplying them to the baloon from their reservoirs,  in proportion as they are consumed. I have in another place[20] given a  description of the apparatus used in this experiment, and have explained  the manner of ascertaining the quantities of the gasses consumed with  the most scrupulous exactitude.    In proportion to the advancement of the combustion, there is a  deposition of water upon the inner surface of the baloon or matrass A:  The water gradually increases in quantity, and, gathering into large  drops, runs down to the bottom of the vessel. It is easy to ascertain  the quantity of water collected, by weighing the baloon both before and  after the experiment. Thus we have a twofold verification of our  experiment, by ascertaining both the quantities of the gasses employed,  and of the water formed by their combustion: These two quantities must  be equal to each other. By an operation of this kind, Mr Meusnier and I  ascertained that it required 85 parts, by weight, of oxygen, united to  15 parts of hydrogen, to compose 100 parts of water. This experiment,  which has not hitherto been published, was made in presence of a  numerous committee from the Royal Academy. We exerted the most  scrupulous attention to its accuracy; and have reason to believe that  the above propositions cannot vary a two hundredth part from absolute  truth.    From these experiments, both analytical and synthetic, we may now affirm  that we have ascertained, with as much certainty as is possible in  physical or chemical subjects, that water is not a simple elementary  substance, but is composed of two elements, oxygen and hydrogen; which  elements, when existing separately, have so strong affinity for caloric,  as only to subsist under the form of gas in the common temperature and  pressure of our atmosphere.    This decomposition and recomposition of water is perpetually operating  before our eyes, in the temperature of the atmosphere, by means of  compound elective attraction. We shall presently see that the phenomena  attendant upon vinous fermentation, putrefaction, and even vegetation,  are produced, at least in a certain degree, by decomposition of water.  It is very extraordinary that this fact should have hitherto been  overlooked by natural philosophers and chemists: Indeed, it strongly  proves, that, in chemistry, as in moral philosophy, it is extremely  difficult to overcome prejudices imbibed in early education, and to  search for truth in any other road than the one we have been accustomed  to follow.    I shall finish this chapter by an experiment much less demonstrative  than those already related, but which has appeared to make more  impression than any other upon the minds of many people. When 16 ounces  of alkohol are burnt in an apparatus[21] properly adapted for collecting  all the water disengaged during the combustion, we obtain from 17 to 18  ounces of water. As no substance can furnish a product larger than its  original bulk, it follows, that something else has united with the  alkohol during its combustion; and I have already shown that this must  be oxygen, or the base of air. Thus alkohol contains hydrogen, which is  one of the elements of water; and the atmospheric air contains oxygen,  which is the other element"]]]
