Yet each fall, when paid off, Jo could not resist the temptation to go  to town with the boys and have a good time 'while the stuff held out.'  So that his property consisted of little more than his saddle, his bed,  and his old cow. He kept on hoping to make a strike that would leave him  well fixed with a fair start, and when the thought came that the Black  Mustang was his mascot, he only needed a chance to 'make the try.'    The roundup circled down to the Canadian River, and back in the fall by  the Don Carlos Hills, and Jo saw no more of the Pacer, though he heard  of him from many quarters, for the colt, now a vigorous, young horse,  rising three, was beginning to be talked of.    Antelope Springs is in the middle of a great level plain. When the water  is high it spreads into a small lake with a belt of sedge around it;  when it is low there is a wide flat of black mud, glistening white with  alkali in places, and the spring a water-hole in the middle. It has no  flow or outlet and is fairly good water, the only drinking-place for  many miles.    This flat, or prairie as it would be called farther north, was the  favorite feeding-ground of the Black Stallion, but it was also the  pasture of many herds of range horses and cattle. Chiefly interested was  the 'L cross F' outfit. Foster, the manager and part owner, was a man of  enterprise. He believed it would pay to handle a better class of cattle  and horses on the range, and one of his ventures was ten half-blooded  mares, tall, clean-limbed, deer-eyed creatures that made the scrub  cow-ponies look like pitiful starvelings of some degenerate and quite  different species.    One of these was kept stabled for use, but the nine, after the weaning  of their colts, managed to get away and wandered off on the range.    A horse has a fine instinct for the road to the best feed, and the nine  mares drifted, of course, to the prairie of Antelope Springs, twenty  miles to the southward. And when, later that summer Foster went to round  them up, he found the nine indeed, but with them and guarding them with  an air of more than mere comradeship was a coal-black stallion, prancing  around and rounding up the bunch like an expert, his jet-black coat a  vivid contrast to the golden hides of his harem.    The mares were gentle, and would have been easily driven homeward  but for a new and unexpected thing. The Black Stallion became greatly  aroused. He seemed to inspire them too with his wildness, and flying  this way and that way drove the whole band at full gallop where he  would. Away they went, and the little cow-ponies that carried the men  were easily left behind.    This was maddening, and both men at last drew their guns and sought a  chance to drop that 'blasted stallion.' But no chance came that was not  9 to 1 of dropping one of the mares. A long day of manoeuvring made  no change. The Pacer, for it was he, kept his family together and  disappeared among the southern sand-hills. The cattlemen on their jaded  ponies set out for home with the poor satisfaction of vowing vengeance  for their failure on the superb cause of it.    One of the most aggravating parts of it was that one or two experiences  like this would surely make the mares as wild as the Mustang, and there  seemed to be no way of saving them from it.    Scientists differ on the power of beauty and prowess to attract female  admiration among the lower animals, but whether it is admiration or the  prowess itself, it is certain that a wild animal of uncommon gifts soon  wins a large following from the harems of his rivals. And the great  Black Horse, with his inky mane and tail and his green-lighted eyes,  ranged through all that region and added to his following from many  bands till not less than a score of mares were in his 'bunch.' Most were  merely humble cow-ponies turned out to range, but the nine great mares  were there, a striking group by themselves. According to all reports,  this bunch was always kept rounded up and guarded with such energy and  jealously that a mare, once in it, was a lost animal so far as man was  concerned, and the ranchmen realized soon that they had gotten on the  range a mustang that was doing them more harm than all other sources of  loss put together.    II    It was December, 1893. I was new in the country, and was setting out  from the ranch-house on the Pinavetitos, to go with a wagon to the  Canadian River. As I was leaving, Foster finished his remark by: \"And if  you get a chance to draw a bead on that accursed mustang, don't fail to  drop him in his tracks.\"    This was the first I had heard of him, and as I rode along I gathered  from Burns, my guide, the history that has been given. I was full  of curiosity to see the famous three-year-old, and was not a little  disappointed on the second day when we came to the prairie on Antelope  Springs and saw no sign of the Pacer or his band.    But on the next day, as we crossed the Alamosa Arroyo, and were rising  to the rolling prairie again, Jack Burns, who was riding on ahead,  suddenly dropped flat on the neck of his horse, and swung back to me in  the wagon, saying:    \"Get out your rifle, here's that--stallion.\"    I seized my rifle, and hurried forward to a view over the prairie ridge.  In the hollow below was a band of horses, and there at one end was the  Great Black Mustang. He had heard some sound of our approach, and was  not unsuspicious of danger. There he stood with head and tail erect,  and nostrils wide, an image of horse perfection and beauty, as noble an  animal as ever ranged the plains, and the mere notion of turning that  magnificent creature into a mass of carrion was horrible. In spite  of Jack's exhortation to 'shoot quick,' I delayed, and threw open  the breach, whereupon he, always hot and hasty, swore at my slowness,  growled, 'Gi' me that gun,' and as he seized it I turned the muzzle up,  and accidentally the gun went off.    Instantly the herd below was all alarm, the great black leader snorted  and neighed and dashed about. And the mares bunched, and away all went  in a rumble of hoofs, and a cloud of dust.    The Stallion careered now on this side, now on that, and kept his eye on  all and led and drove them far away. As long as I could see I watched,  and never once did he break his pace.    Jack made Western remarks about me and my gun, as well as that mustang,  but I rejoiced in the Pacer's strength and beauty, and not for all the  mares in the bunch would I have harmed his glossy hide.    III    There are several ways of capturing wild horses. One is by  creasing--that is, grazing the animal's nape with a rifle-ball so that  he is stunned long enough for hobbling.    \"Yes! I seen about a hundred necks broke trying it, but I never seen a  mustang creased yet,\" was Wild Jo's critical remark.    Sometimes, if the shape of the country abets it, the herd can be driven  into a corral; sometimes with extra fine mounts they can be run down,  but by far the commonest way, paradoxical as it may seem, is to walk  them down.    The fame of the Stallion that never was known to gallop was spreading.  Extraordinary stories were told of his gait, his speed, and his wind,  and when old Montgomery of the 'triangle-bar' outfit came out plump at  Well's Hotel in Clayton, and in presence of witnesses said he'd give one  thousand dollars cash for him safe in a box-car, providing the stories  were true, a dozen young cow-punchers were eager to cut loose and win  the purse, as soon as present engagements were up. But Wild Jo had had  his eye on this very deal for quite a while; there was no time to  lose, so ignoring present contracts he rustled all night to raise the  necessary equipment for the game.    By straining his already overstrained credit, and taxing the already  overtaxed generosity of his friends, he got together an expedition  consisting of twenty good saddle-horses, a mess-wagon, and a fortnight's  stuff for three men--himself, his 'pard,' Charley, and the cook.    Then they set out from Clayton, with the avowed intention of walking  down the wonderfully swift wild horse. The third day they arrived at  Antelope Springs, and as it was about noon they were not surprised to  see the black Pacer marching down to drink with all his band behind him.  Jo kept out of sight until the wild horses each and all had drunk their  fill, for a thirsty animal always travels better than one laden with  water.    Jo then rode quietly forward. The Pacer took alarm at half a mile, and  led his band away out of sight on the soapweed mesa to the southeast. Jo  followed at a gallop till he once more sighted them, then came back and  instructed the cook, who was also teamster, to make for Alamosa Arroyo  in the south. Then away to the southeast he went after the mustangs.  After a mile or two he once more sighted them, and walked his horse  quietly till so near that they again took alarm and circled away to the  south. An hour's trot, not on the trail, but cutting across to where  they ought to go, brought Jo again in close sight. Again he walked  quietly toward the herd, and again there was the alarm and fright. And  so they passed the afternoon, but circled ever more and more to the  south, so that when the sun was low they were, as Jo had expected, not  far from Alamosa Arroyo. The band was again close at hand, and Jo,  after starting them off, rode to the wagon, while his pard, who had been  taking it easy, took up the slow chase on a fresh horse.    After supper the wagon moved on to the upper ford of the Alamosa, as  arranged, and there camped for the night.    Meanwhile, Charley followed the herd. They had not run so far as at  first, for their pursuer made no sign of attack, and they were getting  used to his company. They were more easily found, as the shadows fell,  on account of a snow-white mare that was in the bunch. A young moon in  the sky now gave some help, and relying on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30310"],[0,"Special Report on Diseases of Cattle (#18)"],[1,"graze where these plants are abundant at times when  other forage is scarce. The symptoms are salivation, nausea and vomiting,  spasms, dizziness, stupor, and death.      FERN.    The common brake or bracken fern, _Pteris aquilina_, has been considered  responsible for the poisoning of many horses and cattle. Many cases have  been reported in England and Germany, and some well-authenticated cases in  the United States. Very little has been learned experimentally of fern  poisoning, but there seems to be little question that it has been the cause  of many deaths. The symptoms are said to be temperature higher than normal,  loss of appetite, bloody discharges from mouth, nose, and bowels, and great  depression followed by coma and death. Some authors say that the urine is  colored by blood. It is thought by some that the disease known as \"red  water\" in the northwestern United States and Canada is caused by eating  ferns.      SORGHUM POISONING.    Under certain conditions sorghum contains enough hydrocyanic acid to make  it exceedingly dangerous to cattle. These cases of poisoning most commonly  occur when cattle are pastured upon the young plant or upon a field where  the crop has been cut and is making a second growth. Conditions of drought  make the sorghum especially dangerous. There is some reason to think that  the frosted second growth is particularly rich in hydrocyanic acid. The  cases of poisoning occur when animals are grazed upon the plant, but not  from the harvested crop or from silage. If cattle are grazed on sorghum or  sorghum stubble they should at first be under constant observation and  should be removed as soon as any signs of illness appear. Similar  precautions should be used in grazing kafir.      CORNSTALK DISEASE.    Considerable losses of cattle have occurred when they were turned upon  cornfields in the fall. Deaths come very suddenly and there is no  opportunity to apply remedies. It has been thought that these fatalities,  like those from sorghum, were caused by hydrocyanic acid, but there is good  reason to think that this is not true, and at the present time there is no  accepted explanation of this disease, although there seems to be no doubt  that it is connected in some way with the condition of the corn. Whether a  given field is poisonous or not can only be determined by experiment, and  the wise farmer will keep his cattle under close observation when they are  first turned into a cornfield.      WATER HEMLOCK (CICUTA).    This plant, growing in wet places by ditches and along creeks, is the most  poisonous of North American plants. The root is the poisonous part, and  cattle generally get it when it is plowed up or washed out by high water.  Sometimes they pull it up, for the plant occasionally grows out into  ditches so that the whole plant will be taken in grazing. The most marked  symptoms of Cicuta poisoning are the violent convulsions, which remind one  of the effect of strychnin.    _Treatment._--Little can be done in the way of treatment. The logical thing  is to attempt to control the convulsions by means of morphia, but in view  of the fact that the stomach can not be emptied, the prognosis is not good,  and most cases die.      LARKSPURS.    The larkspurs are a source of heavy loss to cattle owners in the higher  ranges of the West. There are a number of species, growing at altitudes  from 4,000 feet to timber line, and all are poisonous. A few cases of  poisoning by larkspurs have been reported in the eastern United States, but  most of the losses are confined to the West, both because larkspurs grow  there in greater profusion and because cattle are grazed in that region on  the open ranges. The losses are confined to cattle, for sheep and horses  can graze on larkspur with no resulting harm. Most of the larkspur losses  occur in the spring and early summer, as the plants lose their toxicity  after maturing.    _Symptoms._--Larkspur poisoning is accompanied by a definite line of  symptoms. In range animals the first symptom noted is generally the sudden  falling of the animal and consequent inability to rise. After a while it  may rise, only to fall again. This may happen repeatedly. In severe cases  the animal lies prone and exhibits nausea, accompanied by vomiting. It dies  of respiratory paralysis, death many times being hastened by the asphyxia  following the vomiting.    _Treatment._--The animal, if found down, should be turned so that its head  is uphill in order to relieve the lungs. Many cases will recover with no  further treatment. Nearly all cases will recover if a hypodermic injection  is given immediately of physostigmin salicylate 1 grain, pilocarpin  hydrochlorid 2 grains, strychnin sulphate 1/2 grain.      LOCO.    The loco plants have caused especially heavy losses of cattle, horses, and  sheep. They grow in the semiarid regions of the West and sometimes in great  luxuriance. The best known are the \"blue loco,\" the \"woolly loco\" or  \"purple loco,\" and the \"white loco\" or \"rattle-weed.\" The blue loco is  common in parts of New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. It affects both horses  and cattle. The purple loco, _Astragalus mollissimus_, is common in Texas  and the adjoining States and extends north as far as Nebraska and Colorado.  It is especially destructive to horses. The white loco, _Oxytropis  lamberti_, is still more widely distributed, being found in the plains  region from Alaska to Mexico and west of the Rocky Mountains to central  Utah. The white loco is much more important than the purple loco, for it  affects not only horses but cattle and sheep. These plants belong to the  pea family, and there are a number of other species of this family that are  loco plants and produce the same symptoms.    _Symptoms._--Loco poisoning is a chronic condition and symptoms are shown  only after somewhat prolonged feeding. The condition is one of cumulative  poisoning, and animals sometimes decline very rapidly after the first  symptoms appear. In many cases animals acquire a habit of eating loco and  prefer it to any other feed. The poison affects the central nervous system.  There is a lack of muscular coordination and the animal performs very  erratic movements. In the later stages the animal becomes emaciated and  eventually dies of starvation.    _Treatment._--Locoed animals are badly constipated, and it is important  that this condition should be remedied at the start. Any purgative can be  used, but Epsom salt has been found especially effective. If locoed animals  can be turned into a field of alfalfa, a large proportion of them will  recover with no further treatment. Recovery may be aided by giving cattle,  hypodermically, daily doses of three-twentieths to four-twentieths of a  grain of strychnin. By this treatment cattle can be cured and put in  condition for market.      WHITE SNAKEROOT (EUPATORIUM URTICAEFOLIUM).    White snakeroot, frequently known as \"rich weed,\" is a plant growing in  great abundance in some of the eastern and central regions of the United  States. It is particularly abundant in parts of Ohio, Indiana, and  Illinois, and in western North Carolina. It is responsible for most, if not  all, of the cases of a disease which is commonly known as \"milk sickness.\"    _Symptoms._--The animals are constipated, sometimes have bloody feces,  become weak, and exhibit muscular trembling. This trembling is very  characteristic, so that the disease is sometimes known as \"the trembles.\"    _Remedy._--There are no remedies which will work very efficiently. It is  desirable to give the animals purgatives like Epsom salt and, of course, to  remove them from fields where this plant is abundant.      RAYLESS GOLDENROD (ISOCOMA WRIGHTII).    The rayless goldenrod is a plant growing in especial abundance in parts of  the Pecos Valley in New Mexico and Arizona, and there produces a disease so  much like that produced in the East by white snakeroot that it is sometimes  called milk sickness. More generally this disease goes under the name of  \"alkali disease.\" The plant has produced heavy losses in the regions where  it grows abundantly.    _Symptoms._--The symptoms are much like those produced by the white  snakeroot. The animals are constipated, sometimes have bloody feces, become  weak, and exhibit muscular trembling. There is good reason to think, too,  that the milk of cows eating this plant is more or less injurious.    _Treatment._--A purgative like Epsom salt will aid an animal in recovering,  but most important is to remove the cattle from pastures where the plant is  abundant and give them an abundance of good forage. Under such conditions  they are almost certain to recover.      MILKWEEDS.    Many of the milkweeds have long been known to have more or less poisonous  properties. Within the last few years it has been discovered that certain  of the milkweeds going under the popular name of whorled milkweeds are  especially toxic. There are at least four species of whorled milkweeds, but  two of them are particularly important from the standpoint of people  handling livestock. One, known scientifically as _Asclepias galioides_, is  harmful in Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, while another, known as  _Asclepias mexicana_, has produced losses, especially in California and  Nevada. These whorled milkweeds are distasteful to all animals and are  eaten only when the stock is closely confined to pastures where there is  little else in the way of forage.    _Symptoms._--The most prominent symptoms are weakness, producing  staggering, and this is followed in acute cases by violent spasms.    _Treatment._--There is no treatment which will effectively antidote the  effect of the poison. In practically all cases, however, poisoning may be  avoided if care is taken to prevent animals from being closely confined  where this plant is abundant, as they never eat the plant by choice.
