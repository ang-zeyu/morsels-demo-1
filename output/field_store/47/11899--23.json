Several attempts at separation failed. In 1971, two  years after a revolt, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede; this  arrangement was formally recognized in 1980 with Anguilla becoming a  separate British dependency.

The economy, and especially  the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the  effects of Hurricane Luis in September but recovered in 1996.  Increased activity in the tourism industry, which has spurred the  growth of the construction sector, has contributed to economic  growth. Anguillan officials have put substantial effort into  developing the offshore financial sector. A comprehensive package of  financial services legislation was enacted in late 1994."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27675"],[0,"The 1996 CIA World Factbook (#18)"],[1,"are employed in other European    countries; foreign laborers in Austria number 177,840, about 5% of    labor force (1988)    Unemployment rate: 4.6% (1995 est.)

The Karabakh Armenians have declared independence and seized almost  20% of the country's territory, creating almost 1 million Azeri  refugees in the process. Both sides have generally observed a  Russian-mediated cease-fire in place since May 1994, and support the  OSCE-mediated peace process, now entering its fifth year.  Nevertheless, Baku and Xankandi (Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh  region) remain far apart on most substantive issues from the  placement and composition of a peacekeeping force to the enclave's  ultimate political status, and prospects for a negotiated settlement  remain dim.
