Mr. Romanes (_Nature_, 18th May 1893) quotes as follows from          a letter addressed to him by the Rev. W. G. Proudfoot:--\"On          looking up I noticed that hundreds of large black ants were          going up and down the tree, and then I saw the aphides....          But what struck me most was that the aphides showered down          their excretions independently of the ants' solicitations,          while at other times I noticed that an ant would approach an          aphis without getting anything, and would then go to          another. I was struck with this, because I remembered Mr.          Darwin's inability to make the aphides yield their secretion          after many experiments. A large number of hornets were          flying about the tree, but seemed afraid of the ants; for          when they attempted to alight, an ant would at once rush to          the spot, and the hornet would get out of its way.\"    A yellow ant, who wishes to enjoy the result of the cares given to his  pensioner, approaches it and gently caresses it with his antennae; the  other shows signs of pleasure at this visit, and soon a pearly drop  appears on the tuft of hairs at the edge of its elytra, and this the  ant hastens to lick. The beetle is thus exploited and tickled by all  the members of the community to which he belongs who meet him on their  road. But when it has been milked two or three times it ceases to  secrete. A solicitous ant arriving at this moment finds its efforts in  vain, but still behaves like a good shepherd; it shows no impatience  or anger towards its exhausted beast, knowing well that it is only  necessary to come back a little later or to go to another member of  the herd. Nor are his cares lessened by finding the source dried up.  He foresees that it will still be good after repose, and if it is  hungry he disgorges food for it.    _Degrees of civilisation in the same species of Ants._--These facts  are sufficiently marvellous in themselves, but are more surprising  when we recollect that they cannot be regarded as an innate and  unreflecting instinct with which all the individuals of the same  species are endowed. The art of domesticating the _Claviger_ is a  stage of civilisation reached by some tribes and not by others.  Lespes[66] has placed this out of doubt in the following manner. He  had specimens of _Lasius niger_ who exploited a flock of Coleoptera.  Having met ants of the same species who possessed no flocks, he  brought them some. At the sight of the little insects they threw  themselves on them, killed them, and devoured them. If we compare  these facts with those which pass in human societies, it will seem to  us that these latter Hymenoptera behave like a horde of hunters in the  presence of a flock of sheep, while the first have already arrived at  the sheep-herding stage.       [66] \"Recherches sur quelques Coleopteres aveugles,\" _Ann.          Sc. Nat._, v. Serie, t. ix., 1868, p. 71.    _Aphis-pens and paddocks._--Ants can also keep Aphides in their homes.  In this case, fearing that the adult beasts may not be able to adopt a  change of surroundings and food, they bring the eggs to their nests  and care for them at the same time as their own children. In time they  come out and constitute a flock easy to tame. Other ants, still more  intelligent, have discovered a method of holding the Aphides captive,  while allowing them to enjoy their accustomed life, and to feed at  will on the foods they prefer on their own favourite spots. It is  sufficient for this purpose to establish barriers around a group of  cattle who have themselves fixed the place of their sojourn. The  _Lasius niger_, a skilful architect, constructs vaulted passages from  his dwelling into the country. These covered roads, built with earth  moistened with saliva, have various ends; some have been made in order  to reach remote work sheltered from the sun, or to give concealment  from enemies. Many lead to the pens of the Aphides; they reach from  the anthill as far as the foot of a plant where these insects are  abundant. In order to have their milkers at their disposal, without  removing them from pasture, the ants make tunnels along the stalk, and  enclose within it all the Aphides they meet. They thus prevent any  desire for a distant ramble. But in order that the flock may not be  too closely confined, the _Lasius niger_ enlarge the galleries in  places, and make a sort of chamber or stable in which the beasts may  disport themselves at ease. These halls, which are proportionately  very vast, are supported against the branches and leaves of the plant  which bears up the walls and the vaults. The captives find themselves  then with all the advantages of material life, and may be milked with  every facility.[67]       [67] P. Huber, _Recherches sur les Moeurs des Fourmis          indigenes_, pp. 176-200.    An allied species of ant, the _Lasius brunneus_, lives almost entirely  on the sweet secretion of large Aphides in the bark of oaks and walnut  trees. The ants construct around these insects cabins made of  fragments of wood, and wall them in completely so as to keep them at  their own disposal.    The _Myrmica_ also forms similar pasture lands; its system is rather  less perfect than that of the _Lasius_, as it does not form covered  galleries to reach its stables. It is content to build large earth  huts around a colony. A large hole, which allows the passage of the  ants, but not the escape of the flock, is formed so that they may come  to milk their cows. They use the same methods we have seen practised  on the _Claviger_, caressing the insect with their antennae until the  sugared drop appears.[68]       [68] In Central America, Belt has described how the          Leaf-hoppers are milked for their honey by various species          of Ants, and also by a Wasp. He considered that some species          of Leaf-hopper would be exterminated if it were not for the          protection they received from Ants.--_Naturalist in          Nicaragua_, 1888, pp. 227-230.    An example is quoted which shows still greater intelligence and  foresight in Ants. They have been known to repopulate their  territories after an epidemic, or at least after the destruction of  their Aphides. The proprietor of a tree, finding it covered with these  exploited beasts, cleared it of its inconvenient guests by repeated  washes; but the dispossessed Hymenoptera, considering that this  pasture close to their nest was very convenient for a flock, resolved  to repopulate it, and for some time these tenacious insects could be  seen bringing back among the foliage Aphides captured elsewhere.[69]       [69] P. Huber, _Recherches_, etc., pp. 210-250; Lubbock, \"On          the Habits of Ants,\" _Wiltshire Arch. and Nat. Hist. Mag._,          1879, pp. 49-62.    _Slavery among Ants._--The custom of making slaves is widely spread in  the ant world; I have already described the expeditions organised to  obtain them. We will now consider the relations of these insects among  themselves.    The _Formica sanguinea_ takes possession of the eggs of the _Formica  fusca_ and rears them with its own. When the slaves reach the adult  condition they live beside their masters and share their labours, for  the latter work, are skilful in all tasks, and can by their own  activity construct an ant-hill and keep it going. If they desire  servants, it is not in order to throw all the work on them, but to  have intelligent assistants. This is the primitive form of slavery as  it first existed among men. It was not until later that it became  modified, to become at last an institution against which the sentiment  of justice arose. Other species of Ants have pushed the exploitation  of slaves to a point Man has never reached. But the _Formica  sanguinea_ are companions to their helpers rather than masters, and  even show them great consideration. When the colony emigrates one may  see the owners of the nest, who are of larger size than the _Formica  fusca_, take these up in their jaws and carry them the entire way.    The Amazons (_Polyergus rufescens_) act otherwise. Very skilful in  obtaining slaves and powerfully armed for triumphant raids, their  nests always contain legions of servants, and the custom of being  waited upon has become so impressed on the race by heredity that it is  an instinct stronger even than personal preservation. The master ant  has not only lost the taste and the idea of work, but even the habit  of feeding himself, and would die of hunger beside a pile of honey or  sugar if a grey ant was not there to put it into his mouth. Thus  Huber, the earliest accurate observer of these ants, enclosed thirty  Amazons with several pupae and larvae of their own species, and twenty  negro pupae, in a glass box, the bottom of which was covered with a  thick layer of earth; honey was given to them, so that, although cut  off from their auxiliaries, the Amazons had both shelter and food. At  first they appeared to pay some little attention to the young; this  soon ceased, and they neither traced out a dwelling nor took any food;  in two days one-half died of hunger, and the other remained weak and  languid. Commiserating their condition, he gave them _one_ of their  black companions. This little creature, unassisted, formed a chamber  in the earth, gathered together the larvae, put everything into  complete order, and preserved the lives of those which were about to  perish.    All their industry is expended in the acquisition of captives. The  _Polyergus_ avoid introducing into their houses adults who would not  become reconciled to the loss of liberty, and would prefer to die  rather than work for others."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29839"],[0,"The House in the Water: A Book of Animal Stories (#18)"],[1," herself in miniature, only of a paler colour and  softer, silkier fur. In her ardent, unflagging devotion to these  little ones she undertook no hunting that would take her far from  home, but satisfied her appetite with mice, slugs, worms and beetles.    Living in such seclusion as she did, her enemies the wolves lost all  track of her for the time. The pack had broken up, as a formal  organization, according to the custom of wolf-packs in summer. But  there was still more or less cohesion, of a sort, between its  scattered members; and the leader and his mate had a cave not many  miles from the wolverene's retreat.    As luck would have it, the gray old leader, returning to the cave one  day with the body of a rabbit between his gaunt jaws, took a short cut  across the swamp, and came upon the trail of his long-lost enemy. In  fact, he came upon several of her trails; and he understood very well  what it meant. He had no time, or inclination, to stop and look into  the matter then; but his sagacious eyes gleamed with vengeful  intention as he continued his journey.    About this time--the time being a little past midsummer--the man came  back to his cabin, bringing supplies. It was a long journey between  the cabin and the settlements, and he had to make it several times  during the brief summer, in order to accumulate stores enough to last  through the long, merciless season of the great snows. When he reached  the cabin and found that, in spite of all his precautions, the greedy  carcajou had outwitted him and broken in, and pillaged his stores, his  indignation knew no bounds.    The carcajou had become an enemy more dangerous to him than all the  other beasts of the wild together. She must be hunted down and  destroyed before he could go on with his business of laying in stores  for the winter.    For several days the man prowled in ever-widening circles around his  cabin, seeking to pick up his enemy's fresh trail. At last, late one  afternoon, he found it, on the outskirts of the swamp. It was too late  to follow it up then. But the next day he set out betimes with rifle,  axe and spade, vowed to the extermination of the whole carcajou  family, for he knew, as well as the old wolf did, why the carcajou had  taken up her quarters in the swamp.    It chanced that this very morning was the morning when the wolves had  undertaken to settle their ancient grudge. The old leader--his mate  being occupied with her cubs--had managed to get hold of two other  members of the pack, with memories as long as his. The unravelling of  the trails in the swamp was an easy task for their keen noses. They  found the burrow on the dry, warm knoll, prowled stealthily all about  it for a few minutes, then set themselves to digging it open. When the  man, whose wary, moccasined feet went noiselessly as a fox's, came in  eyeshot of the knoll, the sight he caught through the dark jumble of  tree-trunks brought him to a stop. He slunk behind a screen of  branches and peered forth with eager interest. What he saw was three  big, gray wolves, starting to dig furiously. He knew they were digging  at the carcajou's burrow.    When the wolves fell to digging their noses told them that there were  young carcajous in the burrow, but they could not be sure whether the  old one was at home or not. On this point, however, they were  presently informed. As the dry earth flew from beneath their furious  claws, a dark, blunt snout shot forth, to be as swiftly withdrawn.  Its appearance was followed by a yelp of pain, and one of the younger  wolves drew back, walking on three legs. One fore paw had been bitten  clean through, and he lay down whining, to lick and cherish it. That  paw, at least, would do no more digging for some time.    The man, in his hiding-place behind the screen, saw what had happened,  and felt a twinge of sympathetic admiration for his enemy, the savage  little fighter in the burrow. The remaining two wolves now grew more  cautious, keeping back from the entrance as well as they could, and  undermining its edges. Again and again the dark muzzle shot forth, but  the wolves always sprang away in time to escape punishment. This went  on till the wolves had made such an excavation that the man thought  they must be nearing the bottom of the den. He waited breathlessly for  the denouement, which he knew would be exciting.    He had not long to wait.    On a sudden, as if jerked from a catapult, the old carcajou sprang  clear out, snatching at the muzzle of the nearest wolf. He dodged, but  not quite far enough; and she caught him fairly in the side of the  throat, just behind the jaw. It was a deadly grip, and the wolf rose  on his hind legs, struggling frantically to shake her off. But with  her great strength and powerful, clutching claws, which she used  almost as a bear might, she pulled him down on top of her, striving to  use his bulk as a shield against the fangs of the other wolf; and the  two rolled over and over to the foot of the knoll.    It was the second young wolf, unfortunately for her, that she had  fastened upon, or the victory, even against such odds, might have been  hers. But the old leader was wary. He saw that his comrade was done  for; so he stood watchful, biding his chance to get just the grip he  wanted. At length, as he saw the younger wolf's struggles growing  feebler, he darted in and slashed the carcajou frightfully across the  loins. But this was not the hold that he wanted. As she dropped her  victim and turned upon him valiantly, he caught her high up on the  back, and held her fast between his bone-crushing jaws. It was a final  and fatal grip; but she was not beaten until she was dead. With her  fierce eyes already glazing she writhed about and succeeded in fixing  her death-grip upon the victor's lean fore leg. With the last ounce  of her strength, the last impulses of her courage and her hate, she  clinched her jaws till her teeth met through flesh, sinew and the  cracking bone itself. Then her lifeless body went limp, and with a  swing of his massive neck the old wolf flung her from him.    Having satisfied himself that she was quite dead, the old wolf now  slunk off on three legs into the swamp, holding his maimed and  bleeding limb as high as he could. Then the man stepped out from his  hiding-place and came forward. The wolf who had been first bitten got  up and limped away with surprising agility; but the one in whose  throat the old carcajou had fixed her teeth lay motionless where he  had fallen, a couple of paces from his dead slayer. Wolf-pelts were no  good at this season, so the man thrust the body carelessly aside with  his foot. But he stood for a minute or two looking down with whimsical  respect on the dead form of the carcajou.    \"Y' ain't nawthin' but a thief an' stinkin' Glutton,\" he muttered  presently, \"an' the whole kit an' bilin' of ye's got to be wiped out!  But, when it comes to grit, clean through, I takes off my cap to ye!\"          WHEN THE TRUCE OF THE WILD IS DONE      BY day it was still high summer in the woods, with slumbrous heat at  noon, and the murmur of insects under the thick foliage. But to the  initiated sense there was a difference. A tang in the forest scents  told the nostrils that autumn had arrived. A crispness in the feel of  the air, elusive but persistent, hinted of approaching frost. The  still warmth was haunted, every now and then, by a passing ghost of  chill. Here and there the pale green of the birches was thinly webbed  with gold. Here and there a maple hung out amid its rich verdure a  branch prematurely turned, glowing like a banner of aerial rose. Along  the edges of the little wild meadows which bordered the loitering  brooks the first thin blooms of the asters began to show, like a veil  of blown smoke. In open patches, on the hillsides the goldenrod burned  orange and the fireweed spread its washes of violet pink. Somewhere  in the top of a tall poplar, crowning the summit of a glaring white  bluff, a locust twanged incessantly its strident string. Mysteriously,  imperceptibly, without sound and without warning, the change had  come.    Hardly longer ago than yesterday, the wild creatures had been unwary  and confident, showing themselves everywhere. The partridge coveys had  whirred up noisily in full view of the passing woodsman, and craned  their necks to watch him from the near-by branches. On every shallow  mere and tranquil river-reach the flocks of wild ducks had fed boldly,  suffering canoe or punt to come within easy gunshot. In the heavy  grass of the wild meadows, or among the long, washing sedges of the  lakeside, the red deer had pastured openly in the broad daylight, with  tramplings and splashings, and had lifted large bright eyes of  unterrified curiosity if a boat or canoe happened by. The security of  that great truce, which men called \"close season\" had rested sweetly  on the forest.    Then suddenly, when the sunrise was pink on the mists, a gunshot had  sent the echoes clamouring across the still lake waters, and a flock  of ducks, flapping up and fleeing with frightened cries, had left one  of its members sprawling motionless among the flattened sedge, a heap  of bright feathers spattered with blood. Later in the morning a rifle  had cracked sharply on the hillside, and a little puff of white smoke  had blown across the dark front of the fir groves. The truce had come  to an end.    All summer long men had kept the truce with strictness, and the  hunter's fierce instinct, curbed alike by law and foresight, had  slumbered. But now the young coveys were full-fledged and strong of  wing, well able to care for themselves. The young ducks were full  grown, and no longer needed their mother's guardianship and teaching.  The young deer were learning to shift for themselves, and finding, to  their wonder and indignation, that their mothers grew day by day more  indifferent to them, more inclined to wander off"]]]
