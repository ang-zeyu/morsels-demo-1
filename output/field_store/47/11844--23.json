There was also another point in which the    cathedrals were meant to resemble and supply the place of the old    religious houses, _i.e._, in the maintenance of a certain number    of students at the universities.\"      R^t. WHISTON, _Cathedral Trusts and their Fulfilment_, p. 2-4.    \"The nature of these schools, and the desire to perpetuate and improve  them, may be inferred from 'certein articles noted for the reformation  of the cathedral churche of Excestr', submitted by the commissioners of  Henry VIII., unto the correction of the Kynges Majestie,' as follows:      _The tenth Article_ submitted. \"That ther may be in the said    Cathedral churche a free songe scole, the scolemaster to have    yerly of the said pastor and prechars xx. marks for his wages, and    his howss free, to teache xl. children frely, to rede, to write,    synge and playe upon instruments of musike, also to teache ther    A. B. C. in greke and hebrew.

At this erection were    present, Thomas Cranmer, archbishop, with divers other    commissioners. And nominating and electing such convenient and fit    persons as should serve for the furniture of the said Cathedral    church according to the new foundation, it came to pass that, when    they should elect the children of the Grammar school, there were    of the commissioners more than one or two who would have none    admitted but sons or younger brethren of gentlemen. As for other,    husbandmen's children, they were more meet, they said, for the    plough, and to be artificers, than to occupy the place of the    learned sort; so that they wished none else to be put to school,    but only gentlemen's children. Whereunto the most reverend father,    the Archbishop, being of a contrary mind, said, 'That he thought    it not indifferent so to order the matter; for,' said he, 'poor    men's children are many times endued with more singular gifts of    nature, which are also the gifts of God, as, with eloquence,    memory, apt pronunciation, sobriety, and such like; and also    commonly more apt to apply their study, than is the gentleman's    son, delicately educated.' Hereunto it was on the other part    replied, 'that it was meet for the ploughman's son to go to    plough, and the artificer's son to apply the trade of his parent's    vocation; and the gentleman's children are meet to have the    knowledge of government and rule in the commonwealth. For we    have,' said they, 'as much need of ploughmen as any other state;    and all sorts of men may not go to school.' 'I grant,' replied the    Archbishop, 'much of your meaning herein as needful in a    commonwealth; but yet utterly to exclude the ploughman's son and    the poor man's son from the benefits of learning, as though they    were unworthy to have the gifts of the Holy Ghost bestowed upon    them as well as upon others, is as much to say, as that Almighty    God should not be at liberty to bestow his great gifts of grace    upon any person, nor nowhere else but as we and other men shall    appoint them to be employed, according to our fancy, and not    according to his most goodly will and pleasure, who giveth his    gifts both of learning, and other perfections in all sciences,    unto all kinds and states of people indifferently. Even so doth he    many times withdraw from them and their posterity again those    beneficial gifts, if they be not thankful. If we should shut up    into a strait corner the bountiful grace of the Holy Ghost, and    thereupon attempt to build our fancies, we should make as perfect    a work thereof as those that took upon them to build the Tower of    Babel; for God would so provide that the offspring of our    first-born children should peradventure become most unapt to    learn, and very dolts, as I myself have seen no small number of    them very dull and without all manner of capacity. And to say the    truth, I take it, that none of us all here, being gentlemen born    (as I think), but had our beginning that way from a low and base    parentage; and through the benefit of learning, and other civil    knowledge, for the most part all gentlemen ascend to their    estate.' Then it was again answered, that the most part of the    nobility came up by feats of arms and martial acts. 'As though,'    said the Archbishop, 'that the noble captain was always    unfurnished of good learning and knowledge to persuade and    dissuade his army rhetorically; who rather that way is brought    unto authority than else his manly looks. To conclude; the poor    man's son by pains-taking will for the most part be learned when    the gentleman's son will not take the pains to get it. And we are    taught by the Scriptures that Almighty God raiseth up from the    dunghill, and setteth him in high authority. And whensoever it    pleaseth him, of his divine providence, he deposeth princes unto a    right humble and poor estate. Wherefore, if the gentleman's son be    apt to learning, let him be admitted; if not apt, let the poor    man's child that is apt enter his room.' With words to the like    effect.\"          R. WHISTON, _Cathedral Trusts_, p. 12-14.    The scandalous way in which the choristers and poor boys were done out  of their proportion of the endowments by the Cathedral clergy, is to be  seen in Mr Whiston's little book.

Winchester (founded 1373) was probably the only  one that did anything before 1450 for the education of our gentry. Eton  was not founded till 1440. The following list of endowed schools founded  before 1545, compiled for me by Mr Brock from Carlisle's _Concise  Description_, shows the dates of all known to him.

Norse story is only one chapter in  that tale of American discovery. I give below an outline of a year's  work on the subject that was once followed by the fourth grade of the  Chicago Normal School. The idea in it is to give importance, sequence,  reasonableness, broad connections, to the discovery of America.    The head of the history department who planned this course says it is  \"in a sense a dramatization of the development of geographical  knowledge.\"    Following is a bare topical outline of the work:        Evolution of the forms of boats.
