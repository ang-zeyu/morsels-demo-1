Mr. Harley--whose admirable dairy establishment was erected for the  purpose of supplying the city of Glasgow with a good quality of milk,  and which has contributed more than any thing else to improve the  quality of the milk furnished to all the principal cities of Great  Britain--adopted the following system of feeding with the greatest  profit: In the early part of the summer, young grass and green barley,  the first cutting especially, mixed with a large proportion of old hay  or straw, and a good quantity of salt to prevent swelling, were used. As  summer advanced, less hay and straw were given, and as the grass  approached ripeness, they were discontinued altogether; but young and  wet clover was never given without an admixture of dry provender. When  grass became scarce, young turnips and turnip leaves were steamed with  hay, and formed a good substitute. As grass decreased, the turnips were  increased, and at length became a complete substitute. As the season  advanced, a large proportion of distillers' grains and wash was given  with other food, but these were found to have a tendency to make the  cattle grain-sick; and if this feeding were long-continued, the health  of the cows became affected. Boiled linseed and short-cut wheat straw  mixed with the grains, were found to prevent the cows from turning sick.  As spring approached, Swedish turnips, when cheap, were substituted for  yellow turnips. These two roots, steamed with hay and other mixtures,  afforded safe food till grass was again in season. When any of the cows  were surfeited, the food was withheld till the appetite returned, when a  small quantity was given, and increased gradually to the full allowance.    But the most elaborate and valuable experiments in the feeding and  management of milch cows, are those made, not long since, by Mr. T.  Horsfall, of England, and published in the Journal of the Royal  Agricultural Society. His practice, though adapted more especially,  perhaps, to his own section, is nevertheless of such general application  and importance as to be worthy of attention. By his course of treatment  he found that he could produce as much and as rich butter in winter as  in summer.    His first object was to afford a full supply of the elements of food  adapted to the maintenance, and also to the produce of the animal; and  this could not be effected by the ordinary food and methods of feeding,  since it is impossible to induce a cow to consume a quantity of hay  requisite to supply the waste of the system, and keep up, at the same  time, a full yield of the best quality of milk. He used, to some extent,  cabbages, kohl rabi, mangolds, shorts, and other substances, rich in the  constituents of cheese and butter. \"My food for milch cows,\" says he,  \"after having undergone various modifications, has for two seasons  consisted of rape cake five pounds, and bran two pounds, for each cow,  mixed with a sufficient quantity of bean-straw, oat-straw, and shells of  oats, in equal proportions, to supply them three times a day with as  much as they will eat. The whole of the materials are moistened and  blended together, and, after being well steamed, are given to the animal  in a warm state. The attendant is allowed one pound to one pound and a  half per cow, according to circumstances, of bean-meal, which he is  charged to give to each cow in proportion to the yield of milk; those in  full milk getting each two pounds per day, others but little. It is dry,  and mixed with the steamed food on its being dealt out separately. When  this is eaten up, green food is given, consisting of cabbages, from  October to December, kohl rabi till February, and mangold till grass  time, with a view to nicety of flavor. I limit the quantity of green  food to thirty or thirty-five pounds per day for each. After each feed,  four pounds of meadow hay, or twelve pounds per day, is given to each  cow. They are allowed water twice a day, to the extent which they will  drink.\"    Bean-straw uncooked having been found to be hard and unpalatable, it was  steamed to make it soft and pulpy, when it possessed an agreeable odor,  and imparted its flavor to the whole mass. It was cut for this purpose  just before ripening, but after the bean was fully grown, and in this  state was found to possess nearly double the amount of albuminous  matter, so valuable to milch cows, of good meadow or upland hay. Bran or  shorts is also vastly improved by steaming or soaking with hot water,  when its nutriment is more readily assimilated. It contains about  fourteen per cent. of albumen, and is rich in phosphoric acid. Rape-cake  was found to be exceedingly valuable. Linseed and cotton-seed cake may  probably be substituted for it in this country.    Mr. Horsfall turned his cows in May into a rich pasture, housing them at  night, and giving them a mess of the steamed mixture and some hay  morning and night; and from June to October they had cut grass in the  stall, besides what they got in the pasture, and two feeds of the  steamed mixture a day. After the beginning of October the cows were kept  housed. With such management his cows generally yielded from twelve to  sixteen quarts of milk (wine measure) a day, for about eight months  after calving, when they fell off in milk, but gained in flesh, up to  calving-time. In this course of treatment the manure was far better than  the average, and his pastures constantly improved. The average amount of  butter from every sixteen quarts of milk was twenty-five ounces--a  proportion far larger than the average.    [Illustration: \"ON THE RAMPAGE.\"]    How widely does this course of treatment differ from that of most  farmers! The object with many seems to be, to see with how little food  they can keep the cow alive. From a correct point of view, the milch cow  should be regarded as an instrument of transformation. The question  should be--with so much hay, so much grain, so many roots, how can the  most milk, or butter, or cheese, be made? The conduct of a manufacturer  who owned good machinery, and an abundance of raw material, and had the  labor at hand, would be considered very senseless, if he hesitated to  supply the material, and keep the machinery at work, at least so long as  he could run it with profit.    Stimulate the appetite, then, and induce the cow to eat, by a frequent  change of diet, not merely enough to supply the constant waste of her  system, but enough and to spare, of a food adapted to the production of  milk of the quality desired.      SOILING.    Of the advantages of soiling milch cows--that is, feeding exclusively in  the barn--there are yet many conflicting opinions. As to its economy of  land and feed there can be no question, it being generally admitted that  a given number of animals may be abundantly fed on a less space; nor is  there much question as to the increased quantity of milk yielded in  stall feeding. Its economy, in this country, turns rather upon the cost  of labor and time; and the question raised by the dairyman is, whether  it will pay--whether its advantages are sufficient to balance the extra  expense of cutting and feeding, over and above cropping on the pasture.  The importance of this subject has been strongly impressed upon the  attention of farmers in many sections of the country, by a growing  conviction that something must be done to improve the pastures, or that  they must be abandoned altogether.    Thousands of acres of neglected pasture-land in the older States are so  poor and worn out that from four to eight acres furnish but a miserable  subsistence for a good-sized cow. No animal can flourish under such  circumstances. The labor and exertion of feeding are too great, to say  nothing of the vastly inferior quality of the grasses in such pastures,  compared with those on more recently seeded lands. True economy would  dictate that such pastures should either be allowed to run to wood, or  be devoted to sheep-walks, or ploughed and improved. Cows, to be able to  yield well, must have plenty of food of a sweet and nutritious quality;  and, unless they find it, they wander over a large space, if at liberty,  and thus deprive themselves of rest.    If a farmer or dairyman unfortunately owns such pastures, there can be  no question that, as a matter of real economy, he had better resort to  the soiling system for his milch cows; by which means he will largely  increase his annual supply of good manure, and thus have the means of  improving, and bringing his land to a higher state of cultivation. A  very successful instance of this management occurs in the report of the  visiting committee of an agricultural society in Massachusetts, in which  they say: \"We have now in mind a farmer in this county who keeps seven  or eight cows in the stable through the summer, and feeds them on green  fodder, chiefly Indian corn. We asked him his reasons for it. His answer  was: 1. That he gets more milk than he can by any other method. 2. That  he gets more manure, especially liquid manure. 3. That he saves it all,  by keeping a supply of mud or mould under the stable, to be taken out  and renewed as often as necessary. 4. That it is less troublesome than  to drive his cows to pasture; that they are less vexed by flies, and  have equally good health. 5. That his mowing land is every year growing  more productive, without the expense of artificial manure.--He estimates  that on an acre of good land twenty tons of green fodder may be raised.  That which is dried is cut fine, and mixed with meal or shorts, and fed  with profit. He believes that a reduced and worn-out farm--supposing the  land to be naturally good--could be brought into prime order in five  years, without any extra outlay of money for manure, by the use of green  fodder in connection with the raising and keeping of pigs; not  fattening them, but selling at the age of four or five months.\" He  keeps most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22775"],[0,"Psychotherapy (#18)"],[1,"and will produce the fit motor  response, the movement towards handing over the book or opening of the  umbrella, and yet there may be no suggestive element involved. We have a  right to speak of suggestion only if a resistance is to be broken down,  that is, if the antagonistic impulse, or the motor setting for the  antagonistic action is relatively strong. If I say to the boy, \"Hand me  the book,\" when he was anxious to hide the book from my eyes and thus  had the wish not to hand it to me and the tone of my request overwhelmed  his own intention, then to be sure suggestion is at work. The stronger  the resistance, the greater the degree of suggestive power which is  needed to overcome the motor setting. If I say to the normal man, \"It  rains,\" while he sees the blue sky and the dry street, his impression  will be stronger than my suggestion; but if he is suggestible and I tell  him that it will rain, he may accept it and take an umbrella on his  walk, even if no indication makes a change of weather probable. The  present impression of the dry street was strong enough to resist the  suggestion, the imaginative idea of that which is to be expected in the  next hour was too weak, and was overwhelmed by the suggestion of the  weather prophecy.    It is clear that the whole suggestive effect, being one of a new motor  setting, depends thus entirely on the equilibrium of the personality  which receives the suggestion. Every element which reaches the mind  through sense organs or through associations must have influence in  helping the one or the other side, that is, in opening the channels of  action in the suggested direction or in the antagonistic one. The  results appear surprising only if we forget how endlessly complex this  psychomotor apparatus really is. If we disregard this complexity we may  easily have the feeling that one person has an unexplainable influence  over another, as if the will of the one could control in a mysterious  way the will of the other. But as soon as we see that every action is  the result of the cooeperation of hundreds of thousands of psychomotor  impulses which are in definite relation to antagonistic energies, and  that the result depends upon the struggling and balancing of this most  complex apparatus, then we understand more easily how outer influences  may help the one or the other side to preponderance: as soon as the  balance turns to the one side, a completely new adjustment must set in.  And we understand especially that there is nowhere a sharp demarcation  line between receiving communications and receiving suggestions. By  small steps suggestion shades over into the ordinary exchange of ideas,  propositions, and impressions, just as attention shades over into a  neutral perception.    To be suggestible means thus to be provided with a psychophysical  apparatus in which new propositions for actions close easily the  channels for antagonistic activity. Such an apparatus carries with it  the disadvantage that the personality may too easily be guided contrary  to his own knowledge and experience. He will be carried away by every  new proposition and will accept beliefs which his own thoughts ought to  reject. On the other hand, it has the advantage that he will be open to  new ideas, be ready to follow good examples, never stubbornly close his  mind to the unaccustomed and the uncomfortable. It is easy to determine  the degree of suggestibility. Take this case. I draw on the blackboard  of a classroom two circles of an equal size, and write in the one the  number fourteen and in the other the number eighty-nine, and ask the  children which is the larger circle. The suggestible ones will believe  that the circle with the higher number in it is really larger than the  other, the unsuggestible children will follow the advice of their senses  and call both equal, and there may be a few children with negative  suggestibility who would call the circle with the higher number the  smaller circle. What happened to the suggestible ones was that the  higher number brought about a motor attitude which faced that whole  complex as being more imposing and this new motor setting was with them  strong enough to overcome the motor adjustment which the circles alone  produced. Such experiments of the psychological laboratory can be varied  a thousandfold, and it might not be unwise to introduce them into many  practical fields. Everybody knows for instance how much may depend upon  the suggestibility of the witness in court. The suggestible witness  believes himself to have seen and heard what the lawyer suggests. The  memory picture which such a witness has in mind offers, of course, much  less resistance to the opposite action and attitude and belief than the  immediate impression. If I show the witness a colored picture of a room  and close the book and ask him whether there were three or four chairs  in the picture and whether the curtain was green or red, the suggestible  man will decide for one or the other proposition, even if there were  only two chairs and a blue curtain. The perception would have resisted  the suggestion, the fading memory image cannot resist it. Thus  suggestibility is really a practical factor in every walk of life. And  it is in the highest interests of psychotherapy that this intimate  connection between suggestion and ordinary talk and intercourse, between  suggestion and ordinary choice of motives, between suggestion and  attention be steadily kept in view and that suggestion is not  transformed into a kind of mysterious agency.    To be sure, the importance of suggestion for psychotherapy is not  confined to these suggestive processes of daily life. They play a role  there, as we shall see, and we shall claim that even the mere presence  of the physician may have its suggestive power and so may every remedy  which he applies. But no doubt many of his suggestive effects depend on  a power which far transcends the suggestions of our daily life. Yet the  psychologist must insist again that no new principle is involved, that  even in the strongest forms of suggestion, in hypnotism, nothing depends  upon any special influence emanating from the mind of the hypnotizer or  upon any special power flowing over from brain to brain; but that  everything results from the change of equilibrium in the psychomotor  processes of the hypnotized, and thus upon the interplay of his own  mental functions. All that is needed is a higher degree of  suggestibility than is found in the normal life. In a more suggestible  mind even the direct sense impressions may be overwhelmed by the  proposition for an untrue belief and the strongest desires may yield to  the new propositions of action. This library may then become a garden  where the hypnotized person picks flowers from the floor, and the wise  man stands on one leg and repeats the alphabet, if the hypnotizer asks  him to do so. Let us consider at first this extreme case. By a few  manipulations I have brought a man into a deep hypnotic state. He is now  unable to resist any suggestion, either suggestion of impulse or  suggestion of belief, and as every one of the hypnotic phenomena can be  explained in this way, we may claim that the hypnotic state is in its  very nature a state of reenforced suggestibility. Whether I say, \"You  will not move your arm,\" or whether I say, \"You cannot move your arm,\"  awakening in the one case the impulse to the suppression of the  movement, in the other case the belief in the impossibility of the  movement, in either case the result is the same; the arm remains stiff  and any effort of his to move it is inhibited. I may go to the extreme  and tell him that our friend by my side has left the room; he will not  see him, he will not even hear a word which the friend speaks. If I take  a hat in my hand and put it on the friend's head, the hat appears to  hang in the air. Every impression of sound or sight or touch which comes  from the friend is entirely inhibited. The direct sense impression of  eye and ear is thus completely overwhelmed by the suggestion.    What has happened? Are the manipulations which I applied sufficient to  produce the changes by their physical influence? Certainly not; they are  of the most different kinds and yet all may have the same effect.  Perhaps I may have used the easy method of making the subject stare at a  shining button held in front of his forehead. Or I may have used slight  tactual impressions, while he was lying with closed eyes, or I may have  produced the abnormal state by monotonous noises of falling waterdrops,  or I may have simply spoken to him and asked him to think of sleep and  to relax and to feel tired, while I held my hand on his forehead or  while I held his hand in mine. Or I may have relied upon mild talking  without touching him at all; and yet every time the result was reached  in the same degree. There is thus certainly no special physical energy  which like a magnetic force flows over. It cannot even be said that my  will is engaged. I have often hypnotized without even thinking of the  subject before me, going through adjusted manipulations while my  thoughts were engaged in something else. I have even hypnotized over the  telephone; and a written note may be substituted with the same result. I  write to the patient that two minutes after receiving this letter by  mail, he will fall into hypnotic sleep. The effect sets in; and yet at  that time, I may not remember sending the note at all.    It is thus entirely evident that the hypnotic effect results only from  the mental conditions of the subject. Whatever may stimulate his mind  to the right kind of reaction will produce the desired result. The  increased suggestibility thus sets in by his own imagination which may  be stirred up by slight visual or tactual or acoustic stimuli or by  monotonous words or by feelings of relaxation and especially by words  which encourage"]]]
