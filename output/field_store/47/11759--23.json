At the end of his  observations he climbed into the grey car.    \"Can I drop you anywhere?\"    \"Thanks,\" said George. \"If it's not taking you out your way.\"    \"I'm staying at Belpher Castle.\"    \"I live quite near there. Perhaps you'd care to come in and have a  drink on your way?\"    \"A ripe scheme,\" agreed Reggie    Ten minutes in the grey car ate up the distance between the links  and George's cottage. Reggie Byng passed these minutes, in the  intervals of eluding carts and foiling the apparently suicidal  intentions of some stray fowls, in jerky conversation on the  subject of his iron-shots, with which he expressed a deep  satisfaction.    \"Topping little place! Absolutely!\" was the verdict he pronounced  on the exterior of the cottage as he followed George in. \"I've  often thought it would be a rather sound scheme to settle down in  this sort of shanty and keep chickens and grow a honey coloured  beard, and have soup and jelly brought to you by the vicar's wife  and so forth. Nothing to worry you then. Do you live all alone  here?\"    George was busy squirting seltzer into his guest's glass.    \"Yes. Mrs. Platt comes in and cooks for me. The farmer's wife next  door.\"    An exclamation from the other caused him to look up. Reggie Byng  was staring at him, wide-eyed.    \"Great Scott! Mrs. Platt! Then you're the Chappie?\"    George found himself unequal to the intellectual pressure of the  conversation.    \"The Chappie?\"    \"The Chappie there's all the row about. The mater was telling me  only this morning that you lived here.\"    \"Is there a row about me?\"    \"Is there what!\" Reggie's manner became solicitous. \"I say, my dear  old sportsman, I don't want to be the bearer of bad tidings and  what not, if you know what I mean, but didn't you know there was a  certain amount of angry passion rising and so forth because of you?  At the castle, I mean. I don't want to seem to be discussing your  private affairs, and all that sort of thing, but what I mean is...  Well, you don't expect you can come charging in the way you have  without touching the family on the raw a bit. The daughter of the  house falls in love with you; the son of the house languishes in  chokey because he has a row with you in Piccadilly; and on top of  all that you come here and camp out at the castle gates! Naturally  the family are a bit peeved. Only natural, eh? I mean to say,  what?\"    George listened to this address in bewilderment. Maud in love with  him! It sounded incredible. That he should love her after their one  meeting was a different thing altogether. That was perfectly  natural and in order. But that he should have had the incredible  luck to win her affection. The thing struck him as grotesque and  ridiculous.    \"In love with me?\" he cried. \"What on earth do you mean?\"    Reggie's bewilderment equalled his own.    \"Well, dash it all, old top, it surely isn't news to you? She must  have told you. Why, she told me!\"    \"Told you? Am I going mad?\"    \"Absolutely! I mean absolutely not! Look here.\" Reggie hesitated.  The subject was delicate. But, once started, it might as well be  proceeded with to some conclusion. A fellow couldn't go on talking  about his iron-shots after this just as if nothing had happened.  This was the time for the laying down of cards, the opening of  hearts. \"I say, you know,\" he went on, feeling his way, \"you'll  probably think it deuced rummy of me talking like this. Perfect  stranger and what not. Don't even know each other's names.\"    \"Mine's Bevan, if that'll be any help.\"    \"Thanks very much, old chap. Great help! Mine's Byng. Reggie Byng.  Well, as we're all pals here and the meeting's tiled and so forth,  I'll start by saying that the mater is most deucedly set on my  marrying Lady Maud. Been pals all our lives, you know. Children  together, and all that sort of rot. Now there's nobody I think a  more corking sportsman than Maud, if you know what I mean,  but--this is where the catch comes in--I'm most frightfully in love  with somebody else. Hopeless, and all that sort of thing, but  still there it is. And all the while the mater behind me with a  bradawl, sicking me on to propose to Maud who wouldn't have me if I  were the only fellow on earth. You can't imagine, my dear old chap,  what a relief it was to both of us when she told me the other day  that she was in love with you, and wouldn't dream of looking at  anybody else. I tell you, I went singing about the place.\"    George felt inclined to imitate his excellent example. A burst of  song was the only adequate expression of the mood of heavenly  happiness which this young man's revelations had brought upon him.  The whole world seemed different. Wings seemed to sprout from  Reggie's shapely shoulders. The air was filled with soft music.  Even the wallpaper seemed moderately attractive.    He mixed himself a second whisky and soda. It was the next best  thing to singing.    \"I see,\" he said. It was difficult to say anything. Reggie was  regarding him enviously.    \"I wish I knew how the deuce fellows set about making a girl fall  in love with them. Other chappies seem to do it, but I can't even  start. She seems to sort of gaze through me, don't you know. She  kind of looks at me as if I were more to be pitied than censured,  but as if she thought I really ought to do something about it. Of  course, she's a devilish brainy girl, and I'm a fearful chump.  Makes it kind of hopeless, what?\"    George, in his new-born happiness, found a pleasure in encouraging  a less lucky mortal.    \"Not a bit. What you ought to do is to--\"    \"Yes?\" said Reggie eagerly.    George shook his head.    \"No, I don't know,\" he said.    \"Nor do I, dash it!\" said Reggie.    George pondered.    \"It seems to me it's purely a question of luck. Either you're lucky  or you're not. Look at me, for instance. What is there about me to  make a wonderful girl love me?\"    \"Nothing! I see what you mean. At least, what I mean to say is--\"    \"No. You were right the first time. It's all a question of luck.  There's nothing anyone can do.\"    \"I hang about a good deal and get in her way,\" said Reggie.  \"She's  always tripping over me. I thought that might help a bit.\"    \"It might, of course.\"    \"But on the other hand, when we do meet, I can't think of anything  to say.\"    \"That's bad.\"    \"Deuced funny thing. I'm not what you'd call a silent sort of  chappie by nature. But, when I'm with her--I don't know. It's  rum!\" He drained his glass and rose. \"Well, I suppose I may as well  be staggering. Don't get up. Have another game one of these days,  what?\"    \"Splendid. Any time you like.\"    \"Well, so long.\"    \"Good-bye.\"    George gave himself up to glowing thoughts. For the first time in  his life he seemed to be vividly aware of his own existence. It  was as if he were some newly-created thing. Everything around him  and everything he did had taken on a strange and novel interest. He  seemed to notice the ticking of the clock for the first time. When  he raised his glass the action had a curious air of newness. All  his senses were oddly alert. He could even--    \"How would it be,\" enquired Reggie, appearing in the doorway like  part of a conjuring trick, \"if I gave her a flower or two every now  and then? Just thought of it as I was starting the car. She's fond  of flowers.\"    \"Fine!\" said George heartily. He had not heard a word. The  alertness of sense which had come to him was accompanied by a  strange inability to attend to other people's speech. This would no  doubt pass, but meanwhile it made him a poor listener.    \"Well, it's worth trying,\" said Reggie. \"I'll give it a whirl.  Toodleoo!\"    \"Good-bye.\"    \"Pip-pip!\"    Reggie withdrew, and presently came the noise of the car starting.  George returned to his thoughts.    Time, as we understand it, ceases to exist for a man in such  circumstances. Whether it was a minute later or several hours,  George did not know; but presently he was aware of a small boy  standing beside him--a golden-haired boy with blue eyes, who wore  the uniform of a page. He came out of his trance. This, he  recognized, was the boy to whom he had given the note for Maud. He  was different from any other intruder. He meant something in  George's scheme of things.    \"'Ullo!\" said the youth.    \"Hullo, Alphonso!\" said George.    \"My name's not Alphonso.\"    \"Well, you be very careful or it soon may be.\"    \"Got a note for yer. From Lidy Mord.\"    \"You'll find some cake and ginger-ale in the kitchen,\" said the  grateful George. \"Give it a trial.\"    \"Not 'arf!\" said the stripling.        CHAPTER 11.    George opened the letter with trembling and reverent fingers.          \"DEAR MR. BEVAN,          \"Thank you ever so much for your note, which Albert gave      to me. How very, very kind. . .\"      \"Hey, mister!\"    George looked up testily. The boy Albert had reappeared.    \"What's the matter? Can't you find the cake?\"    \"I've found the kike,\" rejoined Albert, adducing proof of the  statement in the shape of a massive slice, from which he took a  substantial bite to assist thought. \"But I can't find the ginger  ile.\"    George waved him away. This interruption at such a moment was  annoying.    \"Look for it, child, look for it! Sniff after it! Bay on its trail!  It's somewhere about.\"    \"Wri'!\" mumbled Albert through the cake. He flicked a crumb off his  cheek with a tongue which would have excited the friendly interest  of an ant-eater. \"I like ginger-ile.\"    \"Well, go and bathe in it.\"    \"Wri'!\"    George returned to his letter.        \"DEAR MR. BEVAN,          \"Thank you ever so much for your note, which Albert gave      to me. How very, very kind of you to come here like this and      to say . . .    \"Hey, mister!\"    \"Good Heavens!\" George glared. \"What's the matter now?  Haven't you  found that ginger-ale yet?\"    \"I've found the ginger-ile right"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22345"],[0,"Memoirs of the Private Life, Return, and Reign of Napoleon in 1815, Vol. I (#18)"],[1,"the Marshal desired me to proceed as quickly as possible to  the Emperor's garden-gate: the Emperor, would come there, and speak to  me without appearing to know me. I went accordingly: the Emperor,  according to his custom, was walking with his hands behind his back.  He passed several times before me without lifting up his eyes; at last  he looked at me: he stopped, and asked me in Italian what countryman  I was. I answered in French that I was a Parisian; that business had  called me to Italy; and that I could not resist the desire of seeing  my old sovereign.--\"Well, Sir, talk to me about Paris and  France;\"--and as he finished these words he began to walk again. I  accompanied him; and after he had put several indifferent questions to  me aloud, he desired me to enter his apartments: he then ordered  Bertrand and Drouot to retire, and forced me to sit down by his side.  Napoleon began in a reserved and absent manner: \"The grand Marshal  tells me that you have just arrived from France.\"--\"Yes, Sire.\"--\"What  do you want here?\"--\"Sire, I wish to offer my services to you; my  conduct in 1814--\" Napoleon interrupting me,--\"Sir, I do not question  but that you are a very good officer, however I have so many officers  with me already, that it will be very difficult for me to assist you;  yet we will see: it appears that you know M. X***.\"--\"Yes,  Sire.\"--\"Has he sent a letter for me by you?\"--\"No, Sire.\"--Napoleon,  interrupting me, \"I see he forgets me just like the rest; since I have  been here, I have not heard a word of him or of any body.\"--I  interrupted the Emperor in my turn, \"Sire, he has never ceased to  entertain those sentiments of devotion and attachment towards your  Majesty which are still cherished by all true Frenchmen; and--\"  Napoleon, with disdain; \"What, do they still think of me in  France?\"--\"Never will they forget you.\"--\"Never! that is a strong  expression; the French have another Sovereign, and they are commanded  both by their duty and their tranquillity to think on him alone.\" This  answer did not please me: the Emperor, thought I to myself, is out of  humour because I have not brought him any letters; he mistrusts me: it  was not worth while to come so far for the sake of such an ungracious  reception.--Napoleon, continuing, \"What do they think about me in  France?\"--\"There, your Majesty is universally deplored and  regretted.\"--\"Yes, and there, also, they manufacture all sorts of lies  concerning me. Sometimes they say that I am mad, sometimes that I am  ill, and you may see (here the Emperor looked at his _embonpoint_), if  I look like an ailing man. It is also given out that they intend to  transport me either to St. Helena or to Malta. I would not advise them  to try. I have provisions for six months, and brave followers to  defend me: but I cannot think that Europe will be so dishonourable as  to rise in arms against a single man, who has neither the power nor  the inclination of hurting others. The emperor Alexander has too much  love for posterity to lend himself to such a crime. They have  guaranteed the sovereignty of the isle of Elba to me by a solemn  treaty. Here I am in my own home; and as long as I do not go out to  pick a quarrel with my neighbours, they have no right to come and  disturb me ... have you served in the grand army?\"--\"Yes, Sire, I had  the felicity of distinguishing myself under your Majesty's eyes in the  plains of Champagne; your Majesty appeared to take such particular  notice of me, that I had dared to hope that your Majesty would  recollect me.\"--\"Why, yes; I thought, somehow, that I knew your face  when I saw you, but I have only a confused recollection of you.\"--Poor  mortals! thought I to myself, go and expose your lives for the sake of  Kings, go and sacrifice your youth, your repose, your happiness for  their sake!--\"In what affairs have you distinguished yourself?\"--\"Sire,  at *****, and at ***** Marshal Ney there presented me to your majesty,  saying, 'Sire, here is the intrepid S.... P..... of whom I have spoken  to your Majesty.'\"--\"Ah! ah! I really do recollect--yes, I was very  well pleased indeed, with your behaviour at **** and at ****; you  showed much resolution, much strength of character. Did I not  'decorate' you on the field of battle?\"--\"Yes, Sire.\"--Napoleon, with  greater warmth and confidence, \"_Eh bien!_ how are they all treated in  France by the Bourbons?\"--\"Sire, the Bourbons have not realized the  expectations of the French, and the number of malcontents increases  every day.\"--Napoleon, sharply; \"So much the worse, so much the worse:  but how, has not X. sent me any letters?\"--\"No, Sire; he was afraid  lest they might be taken from me; and as he thought that your Majesty,  being now compelled to be vigilant, and to distrust all the world,  might distrust me also, he has revealed several circumstances to me,  which are only known to your Majesty and to himself; thus enabling me  to give a proof that I am worthy of your Majesty's confidence.\"--\"Let  us hear them.\" I began my detail, but he exclaimed, without allowing  me to finish, \"that's enough; why did you not begin by telling me all  that? there is half an hour that we have lost.\" This storm[36]  disconcerted me. He perceived my confusion, and resumed his discourse  with mildness.--\"Come, make yourself easy, and repeat to me, with the  greatest minuteness, all that has passed between you and X****.\" I  then related the circumstances which had induced me to have an  interview with Monsieur X****. I repeated our conversation word for  word. I gave him a complete account of all the faults and excesses of  the royal government; and I was going to draw the inferences which had  occurred to Monsieur X**** and me. But the Emperor, who, when he was  affected, was incapable of listening to any recital without  interrupting it, and making his comments at every moment, stopped my  mouth. \"I thought so, too,\" said he, \"when I abdicated, that the  Bourbons, instructed and disciplined by adversity, would not fall  again into the errors which ruined them in 1789. I thought that the  King would govern you '_en bon homme_.' This was the only way by which  he could obtain a pardon from you, for having been put upon you by  foreigners. But since they have stepped into France, they have done  nothing but acts of madness. Their treaty of the twenty-third of  April,\" (raising his voice,) \"has made me deeply indignant: with one  stroke of the pen they have robbed France of Belgium, and of all the  territory acquired since the revolution. They have deprived the nation  of its docks, its arsenals, its fleets, its artillery, and the immense  _materiel_ which I had collected in the fortresses and the ports which  they have ceded. Talleyrand has led them into this infamous business:  he must have been bribed. Peace is easy upon such terms. If, like  them, I had consented to the ruin of France, they would not now be on  my throne:\" (with energy,) \"I would sooner have cut off my right hand.  I preferred renouncing my throne rather than to retain it by staining  my glory, and the honour of the French nation.... A degraded crown is  an intolerable burthen. My enemies have published everywhere, that I  obstinately refused to make peace. They have represented me as a  wretched madman, eager only for blood and carnage: this language  answered their turn. When you wish to hang your dog, you give out  that he is mad: _Quand on veut tuer son chien, il faut bien faire  accroire qu'il est enrage._ But Europe shall know the truth: I will  let the world know all that was said and done at Chatillon. I will  unmask the Austrians, the Russians, and the English with a powerful  hand. Europe shall judge: Europe shall say who was the rogue, and who  was wishing to shed human blood. If I had been mad for war, I might  have retired with my army beyond the Loire, and I might have enjoyed  mountain warfare to my heart's content. I would not; I was tired of  carnage ... my name, and the brave fellows who remained faithful to  me, yet made the allies tremble, even in my capital. They offered  Italy to me as the price of my abdication: I refused it. After once  reigning over France, one ought not to reign anywhere else. I chose  the isle of Elba. They were too happy to give Elba to me. This  position suited me. I can watch France and the Bourbons. All that I  have done has been only for France. It is for her sake and not for  mine that I wished to render her the first nation in the universe. My  glory is made for myself[37] *******. If I had only thought of  myself, I would have returned to a private station, but it was my duty  to retain the imperial title for my family and my son.... Next to  France, my son is the dearest object in the world to me.\"                       [Footnote 35: The corvette commanded by Captain                     Campbell.]                       [Footnote 36: Napoleon usually liked to intimidate                     and disconcert those who approached him.
