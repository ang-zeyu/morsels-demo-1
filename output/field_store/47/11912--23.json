It's chitterlings!\"    \"No, it an't!\" cried Meg, in a burst of delight \"No, it an't!\"    \"Why, what am I a thinking of!\" said Toby, suddenly recovering a  position as near the perpendicular as it was possible for him to assume.  \"I shall forget my own name next. It's tripe!\"    Tripe it was; and Meg, in high joy, protested he should say, in half a  minute more, it was the best tripe ever stewed.    \"And so,\" said Meg, busying herself exultingly with her basket; \"I'll  lay the cloth at once, father; for I have brought the tripe in a basin,  and tied the basin up in a pocket-handkerchief; and if I like to be  proud for once, and spread that for a cloth, and call it a cloth,  there's no law to prevent me; is there father?\"    \"Not that I know of, my dear,\" said Toby. \"But they're always a bringing  up some new law or other.\"    \"And according to what I was reading you in the paper the other day,  father; what the Judge said, you know; we poor people are supposed to  know them all. Ha, ha! What a mistake! My goodness me, how clever they  think us!\"    \"Yes, my dear,\" cried Trotty; \"and they'd be very fond of any one of us  that _did_ know 'em all. He'd grow fat upon the work he'd get, that man,  and be popular with the gentlefolks in his neighborhood. Very much so!\"    \"He'd eat his dinner with an appetite, whoever he was, if it smelt like  this,\" said Meg, cheerfully. \"Make haste, for there's a potato besides.  Where will you dine, father? On the Post, or on the Steps? Dear, dear,  how grand we are. Two places to choose from!\"    \"The steps to day, my Pet,\" said Trotty. \"Steps in dry weather. Post in  wet. There's a great conveniency in the steps at all times, because of  the sitting down; but they're rheumatic in the damp.\"    \"Then here,\" said Meg, clapping her hands, after a moment's bustle;  \"here it is, all ready! And beautiful it looks! Come, father. Eat it  while it's hot. Come!\"    Since his discovery of the contents of the basket, Trotty had been  standing looking at her--and had been speaking too--in an abstracted  manner, which showed that though she was the object of his thoughts and  eyes, to the exclusion even of tripe, he neither saw nor thought about  her as she was at that moment, but had before him some imaginary rough  sketch or drama of her future life. Roused, now, by her cheerful  summons, he shook off a melancholy shake of the head which was just  coming upon him, and trotted to her side. As he was stooping to sit  down, the Chimes rang.    \"Amen!\" said Trotty, pulling off his hat and looking up toward them.    \"Amen to the Bells, father?\" cried Meg.    \"They broke in like a grace, my dear,\" said Trotty, taking his seat.  \"They'd say a good one, I am sure, if they could. Many's the kind thing  they say to me.\"    \"The Bells do, father!\" laughed Meg, as she set the basin, and a knife  and fork before him. \"Well!\"    \"Seem to, my Pet,\" said Trotty, falling to with great vigor. \"And  where's the difference? If I hear 'em, what does it matter whether they  speak it or not? Why bless you, my dear,\" said Toby, pointing at the  tower with his fork, and becoming more animated under the influence of  dinner, \"how often have I heard them bells say, 'Toby Veck, Toby Veck,  keep a good heart Toby! Toby Veck, Toby Veck, keep a good heart Toby!' A  million times? More!\"    \"Well, I never!\" cried Meg.    She had, though--over and over again. For it was Toby's constant topic.    \"When things is very bad,\" said Trotty; \"very bad indeed, I mean; almost  at the worst; then it's 'Toby Veck, Toby Veck, job coming soon, Toby!  Toby Veck, Toby Veck, job coming soon, Toby!' That way.\"    \"And it comes--at last, father,\" said Meg, with a touch of sadness in  her pleasant voice.    \"Always,\" answered the unconscious Toby. \"Never fails.\"    While this discourse was holding, Trotty made no pause in his attack  upon the savory meat before him, but cut and ate, and cut and drank, and  cut and chewed, and dodged about, from tripe to hot potato, and from hot  potato back again to tripe, with an unctuous and unflagging relish. But  happening now to look all round the street--in case anybody should be  beckoning from any door or window, for a porter--his eyes, in coming  back again, encountered Meg: sitting opposite to him, with her arms  folded; and only busy in watching his progress with a smile of  happiness.    \"Why, Lord forgive me!\" said Trotty, dropping his knife and fork. \"My  love! Meg! why didn't you tell me what a beast I was?\"    \"Father?\"    \"Sitting here,\" said Trotty, in penitent explanation, \"cramming and  stuffing, and gorging myself; and you before me there, never so much as  breaking your precious fast, nor wanting to, when----\"    \"But I have broken it, father,\" interposed his daughter, laughing, \"all  to bits. I have had my dinner.\"    \"Nonsense,\" said Trotty. \"Two dinners in one day! It an't possible! You  might as well tell me that two New Year's Days will come together, or  that I have had a gold head all my life, and never changed it.\"    \"I have had my dinner, father, for all that,\" said Meg, coming nearer to  him. \"And if you'll go on with yours, I'll tell you how and where; and  how your dinner came to be brought; and--something else besides.\"    Toby still appeared incredulous; but she looked into his face with her  clear eyes, and laying her hand upon his shoulder, motioned him to go on  while the meat was hot. So Trotty took up his knife and fork again, and  went to work. But much more slowly than before, and shaking his head, as  if he were not at all pleased with himself.    \"I had my dinner, father,\" said Meg, after a little hesitation,  \"with--with Richard. His dinner-time was early; and as he brought his  dinner with him when he came to see me, we--we had it together, father.\"    Trotty said, \"Oh!\"--because she waited.    \"And Richard says, father--\" Meg resumed. Then stopped.    \"What does Richard say, Meg?\" asked Toby.    \"Richard says, father--\" Another stoppage.    \"Richard's a long time saying it,\" said Toby.    \"He says then, father,\" Meg continued, lifting up her eyes at last, and  speaking in a tremble, but quite plainly; \"another year is nearly gone,  and where is the use of waiting on from year to year, when it is so  unlikely we shall ever be better off than we are now? He says we are  poor now, father, and we shall be poor then, but we are young now, and  years will make us old before we know it. He says that if we wait,  people in our condition, until we see our way quite clearly, the way  will be a narrow one indeed--the common way--the Grave, father.\"    A bolder man than Trotty Veck must needs have drawn upon his boldness  largely, to deny it. Trotty held his peace.    \"And how hard, father, to grow old and die, and think we might have  cheered and helped each other! How hard in all our lives to love each  other; and to grieve, apart, to see each other working, changing,  growing old and gray. Even if I got the better of it, and forgot him  (which I never could), oh, father dear, how hard to have a heart so full  as mine is now, and live to have it slowly drained out every drop,  without the recollection of one happy moment of a woman's life, to stay  behind and comfort me, and make me better!\"    Trotty sat quite still, Meg dried her eyes, and said more gayly: that is  to say, with here a laugh, and there a sob, and here a laugh and sob  together:    \"So Richard says, father; as his work was yesterday made certain for  some time to come, and as I love him and have loved him fully three  years--ah! longer than that, if he knew it!--will I marry him on New  Year's Day; the best and happiest day, he says, in the whole year, and  one that is almost sure to bring good fortune with it. It's a short  notice, father--isn't it?--but I haven't my fortune to be settled, or my  wedding dresses to be made, like the great ladies, father, have I? And  he said so much, and said it in his way; so strong and earnest, and all  the time so kind and gentle; that I said I'd come and talk to you,  father. And as they paid the money for that work of mine this morning  (unexpectedly, I am sure!), and as you have fared very poorly for a  whole week, and as I couldn't help wishing there should be something to  make this day a sort of holiday to you as well as a dear and happy day  to me, father, I made a little treat and brought it to surprise you.\"    \"And see how he leaves it cooling on the step!\" said another voice.    It was the voice of the same Richard, who had come upon them unobserved,  and stood before the father and daughter; looking down upon them with a  face as glowing as the iron on which his stout sledge-hammer daily rung.  A handsome, well-made, powerful youngster he was; with eyes that  sparkled like the red-hot droppings from a furnace fire; black hair that  curled about his swarthy temples rarely; and a smile--a smile that bore  out Meg's eulogium on his style of conversation.    \"See how he leaves it cooling on the step!\" said Richard. \"Meg don't  know what he likes. Not she!\"    Trotty, all action and enthusiasm, immediately reached up his hand to  Richard, and was going to address him in a great hurry, when the  house-door opened without any warning, and a footman very nearly put his  foot in the tripe.    \"Out of the vays here, will you! You must always go and be a-settin on  our steps, must you! You can't go and give a turn to none of the  neighbors never, can't you? _Will_ you clear the road, or won't you?\"    Strictly speaking, the last question was irrelevant, as they had already  done it.    \"What's the matter, what's the matter?\" said the gentleman for whom the  door was opened; coming out of the house at that kind of light, heavy  pace--that peculiar compromise between a walk and jog-trot--with which a  gentleman upon the smooth down-hill of life, wearing creaking boots, a  watch-chain, and clean linen, _may_ come out of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28216"],[0,"Respiration Calorimeters for Studying the Respiratory Exchange and Energy (#18)"],[1,"the absorbers closer than to within  0.10 gram. In attempting to secure accuracy no greater than this, it is  unnecessary to lower the glass door to the balance case or, indeed, to  close the two doors to the compartment in which the elevator is closed,  as the slight air-currents do not affect the accuracy of the weighing  when only 0.1 gram sensitiveness is required.      PURIFICATION OF THE AIR-CURRENT WITH SODIUM BICARBONATE.    As is to be expected, the passage of so large a volume of air through  the sulphuric acid in such a relatively small space results in a slight  acid odor in the air-current leaving this absorber. The amount of  material thus leaving the absorber is not weighable, as has been shown  by repeated tests, but nevertheless there is a sufficiently irritating  acid odor to make the air very uncomfortable for subsequent respiration.  It has been found that this odor can be wholly eliminated by passing the  air through a can containing cotton wool and dry sodium bicarbonate.  This can is not weighed, and indeed, after days of use, there is no  appreciable change in its weight.      VALVES.    In order to subdivide experiments into periods as short as 1 or 2 hours,  it is necessary to deflect the air-current at the end of each period  from one set of purifiers to the other, in order to weigh the set used  and to measure the quantity of carbon dioxide and water-vapor absorbed.  The conditions under which these changes from one system to another are  made, and which call for an absolutely gas-tight closure, have been  discussed in detail elsewhere.[21] It is sufficient to state here that  the very large majority of mechanical valves will not serve the purpose,  since it is necessary to have a pressure of some 40 millimeters of  mercury on one side of the valve at the entrance to the absorber system  and on the other side atmospheric pressure. A valve with an internal  diameter of not less than 25 millimeters must be used, and to secure a  tight closure of this large area and permit frequent opening and  shutting is difficult. After experimenting with a large number of  valves, a valve of special construction employing a mechanical seal  ultimately bathed in mercury was used for the earlier apparatus. The  possibility of contamination of the air-current by mercury vapor was  duly considered and pointed out in a description of this apparatus. It  was not until two years later that difficulties began to be experienced  and a number of men were severely poisoned while inside the chamber. A  discussion of this point has been presented elsewhere.[22] At that time  mercury valves were used both at the entrance and exit ends of the  absorber system, although as a matter of fact, when the air leaves the  last absorber and returns to the respiration chamber, the pressure is  but a little above that of the atmosphere. Consequently, mechanical  valves were substituted for mercurial valves at the exit and the toxic  symptoms disappeared. In constructing the new calorimeters it seemed to  be desirable to avoid all use of mercury, if possible. We were fortunate  in finding a mechanical valve which suited this condition perfectly.  These valves, which are very well constructed, have never failed to show  complete tightness under all possible tests and are used at the exit and  entrance end of the absorber system. Their workmanship is of the first  order, and the valve is somewhat higher in price than ordinary  mechanical valves. They have been in use on the apparatus for a year now  and have invariably proved to be absolutely tight. They are easy to  obtain and are much easier to manipulate and much less cumbersome than  the mercury valves formerly used.      COUPLINGS.    Throughout the construction of the respiration apparatus and its various  parts, it was constantly borne in mind that the slightest leak would be  very disastrous for accurate oxygen determinations. At any point where  there is a pressure greater or less than that of the atmosphere, special  precaution must be taken. At no point in the whole apparatus is it  necessary to be more careful than with the couplings which connect the  various absorber systems with each other and with the valves; for these  couplings are opened and closed once every hour or two and hence are  subject to considerable strain at the different points. If they are not  tight the experiment is a failure so far as the determination of oxygen  is concerned. For the various parts of the absorber system we have  relied upon the original type of couplings used in the earlier  apparatus. A rubber gasket is placed between the male and female part of  the coupling and the closure can be made very tight. In fact, after the  absorbers are coupled in place they are invariably subjected to severe  tests to prove tightness.    For connecting the piping between the calorimeter and the absorption  system we use ordinary one-inch hose-couplings, firmly set up by means  of a wrench and disturbed only when necessary to change from one  calorimeter chamber to another.      ABSORBER TABLE.    The purifying apparatus for the air-current is compactly and  conveniently placed on a solidly constructed table which can be moved  about the laboratory at will. The special form of caster on the bottom  of the posts of the table permits its movement about the laboratory at  will and by screwing down the hand screws the table can be firmly fixed  to the floor.    The details of the table are shown in fig. 30. (See also fig. 4, page  4.) The air coming from the calorimeter passes in the direction of the  downward arrow through a 3/4-inch pipe into the blower, which is  immersed in oil in an iron box F. The blower is driven by an electric  motor fastened to a small shelf at the left of the table. The air  leaving the blower ascends in the direction of the arrow to the valve  system H, where it can be directed into one of the two parallel sets of  purifiers; after it passes through these purifiers (sulphuric-acid  vessel 2, potash-lime container K, and sulphuric-acid vessel 1) it goes  through the sodium-bicarbonate can G to a duplicate valve system on top  of the table. From there it passes through a pipe along the top of the  table and rises in the vertical pipe to the hose connection which is  coupled with the calorimeter chamber.    The electric motor is provided with a snap-switch on one of the posts of  the table and a regulating rheostat which permits variations in the  speed of the motor and consequently in the ventilation produced by the  blower. The blower is well oiled, and as oil is gradually carried in  with the air, a small pet-cock at the bottom of the T following the  blower allows any accumulated oil to be drawn away from time to time.  The air entering the valve system at H enters through a cross, two arms  of which connect with two \"white star\" valves. The upper part of the  cross is connected to a small rubber tubing and to the mercury  manometer D, which also serves as a valve for passing a given amount of  air through a series of U-tubes for analysis of the air from time to  time. It is assumed that the air drawn at the point H is of  substantially the same composition as that inside the chamber, an  assumption that may not be strictly true, but doubtless the sample thus  obtained is constantly proportional to the average composition, which  fluctuates but slowly. Ordinarily the piping leading from the left-hand  arm of the tube D is left open to the air and consequently the  difference in the level of the mercury in the two arms of D indicates  the pressure on the system. This is ordinarily not far from 40 to 50  millimeters of mercury.    [Illustration: FIG. 30.--Diagram of absorber table. 1 and 2 contain  sulphuric acid; K contains potash-lime; G, sodium bicarbonate can; F,  rotary blower for maintaining air-current; H, valves for closing either  side; and D, mercury manometer and valve for diverting air to U-tubes on  table. Air leaves A, passes through the meter, and then through drying  tower B and through C to ingoing air-pipe. At the left is the regulating  rheostat and motor and snap-switch. General direction of ventilation is  indicated by arrows.]    The absorber table, with the U-tubes and meter for residual analyses, is  shown in the foreground in fig. 2. The two white porcelain vessels with  a silver-plated can between them are on the middle shelf. The sodium  bicarbonate can, for removing traces of acid fumes, is connected in an  upright position, while the motor, the controlling rheostat, and the  blower are supported by the legs near the floor. The two rubber pipes  leading from the table can be used to connect the apparatus either with  the bed or chair calorimeter. In fig. 4 the apparatus is shown connected  with the bed calorimeter, but just above the lowest point of the rubber  tubing can be seen in the rear the coupling for one of the pipes leading  from the chair calorimeter. The other is immediately below and to the  left of it.      OXYGEN SUPPLY.    The residual air inside of the chamber amounts to some 1,300 liters and  contains about 250 liters of oxygen. Consequently it can be seen that in  an 8-hour experiment the subject could easily live during the entire  time upon the amount of oxygen already present in the residual air. It  has been repeatedly shown that until the per cent of oxygen falls to  about 11, or about one-half normal, there is no disturbance in the  respiratory exchange and therefore about 125 liters of oxygen would be  available for respiration even if no oxygen were admitted. Inasmuch as  the subject when at rest uses not far from 14 to 15 liters per hour, the  amount originally present in the chamber would easily suffice for an  8-hour experiment. Moreover, the difficulties attending an accurate gas  analysis and particularly the calculation of the total amount of oxygen  are such that satisfactory determinations of oxygen"]]]
