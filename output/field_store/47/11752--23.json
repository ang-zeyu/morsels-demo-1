My friend's face fell as he  muttered, \"Yes, yes, they're not half bad.\"    When these Bhanu Singha poems were coming out in the _Bharati_, Dr.  Nishikanta Chatterjee was in Germany. He wrote a thesis on the lyric  poetry of our country comparing it with that of Europe. Bhanu Singha was  given a place of honour as one of the old poets such as no modern writer  could have aspired to. This was the thesis on which Nishikanta  Chatterjee got his Ph. D.!    Whoever Bhanu Singha might have been, had his writings fallen into the  hands of latter-day me, I swear I would not have been deceived. The  language might have passed muster; for that which the old poets wrote in  was not their mother tongue, but an artificial language varying in the  hands of different poets. But there was nothing artificial about their  sentiments. Any attempt to test Bhanu Singha's poetry by its ring would  have shown up the base metal. It had none of the ravishing melody of our  ancient pipes, but only the tinkle of a modern, foreign barrel organ.          (22) _Patriotism_      From an outside point of view many a foreign custom would appear to have  gained entry into our family, but at its heart flames a national pride  which has never flickered. The genuine regard which my father had for  his country never forsook him through all the revolutionary vicissitudes  of his life, and this in his descendants has taken shape as a strong  patriotic feeling. Love of country was, however, by no means a  characteristic of the times of which I am writing. Our educated men then  kept at arms' length both the language and thought of their native  land. Nevertheless my elder brothers had always cultivated Bengali  literature. When on one occasion some new connection by marriage wrote  my father an English letter it was promptly returned to the writer.    The _Hindu Mela_ was an annual fair which had been instituted with the  assistance of our house. Babu Nabagopal Mitter was appointed its  manager. This was perhaps the first attempt at a reverential realisation  of India as our motherland. My second brother's popular national anthem  \"_Bharater Jaya_,\" was composed, then. The singing of songs glorifying  the motherland, the recitation of poems of the love of country, the  exhibition of indigenous arts and crafts and the encouragement of  national talent and skill were the features of this _Mela_.    On the occasion of Lord Curzon's Delhi durbar I wrote a prose-paper--at  the time of Lord Lytton's it was a poem. The British Government of those  days feared the Russians it is true, but not the pen of a 14-year old  poet. So, though my poem lacked none of the fiery sentiments appropriate  to my age, there were no signs of any consternation in the ranks of the  authorities from Commander-in-chief down to Commissioner of Police. Nor  did any lachrymose letter in the _Times_ predict a speedy downfall of  the Empire for this apathy of its local guardians. I recited my poem  under a tree at the Hindu Mela and one of my hearers was Nabin Sen, the  poet. He reminded me of this after I had grown up.    My fourth brother, Jyotirindra, was responsible for a political  association of which old Rajnarain Bose was the president. It held its  sittings in a tumbledown building in an obscure Calcutta lane. Its  proceedings were enshrouded in mystery. This mystery was its only claim  to be awe-inspiring, for as a matter of fact there was nothing in our  deliberations or doings of which government or people need have been  afraid. The rest of our family had no idea where we were spending our  afternoons. Our front door would be locked, the meeting room in  darkness, the watchword a Vedic _mantra_, our talk in whispers. These  alone provided us with enough of a thrill, and we wanted nothing more.  Mere child as I was, I also was a member. We surrounded ourselves with  such an atmosphere of pure frenzy that we always seemed to be soaring  aloft on the wings of our enthusiasm. Of bashfulness, diffidence or fear  we had none, our main object being to bask in the heat of our own  fervour.    Bravery may sometimes have its drawbacks; but it has always maintained a  deep hold on the reverence of mankind. In the literature of all  countries we find an unflagging endeavour to keep alive this reverence.  So in whatever state a particular set of men in a particular locality  may be, they cannot escape the constant impact of these stimulating  shocks. We had to be content with responding to such shocks, as best we  could, by letting loose our imagination, coming together, talking tall  and singing fervently.    There can be no doubt that closing up all outlets and barring all  openings to a faculty so deep-seated in the nature of man, and moreover  so prized by him, creates an unnatural condition favourable to  degenerate activity. It is not enough to keep open only the avenues to  clerical employment in any comprehensive scheme of Imperial  Government--if no road be left for adventurous daring the soul of man  will pine for deliverance, and secret passages still be sought, of which  the pathways are tortuous and the end unthinkable. I firmly believe that  if in those days Government had paraded a frightfulness born of  suspicion, then the comedy which the youthful members of this  association had been at might have turned into grim tragedy. The play,  however, is over, not a brick of Fort-William is any the worse, and we  are now smiling at its memory.    My brother Jyotirindra began to busy himself with a national costume  for all India, and submitted various designs to the association. The  _Dhoti_ was not deemed business-like; trousers were too foreign; so he  hit upon a compromise which considerably detracted from the dhoti while  failing to improve the trousers. That is to say, the trousers were  decorated with the addition of a false dhoti-fold in front and behind.  The fearsome thing that resulted from combining a turban with a  _Sola-topee_ our most enthusiastic member would not have had the  temerity to call ornamental. No person of ordinary courage could have  dared it, but my brother unflinchingly wore the complete suit in broad  day-light, passing through the house of an afternoon to the carriage  waiting outside, indifferent alike to the stare of relation or friend,  door-keeper or coachman. There may be many a brave Indian ready to die  for his country, but there are but few, I am sure, who even for the good  of the nation would face the public streets in such pan-Indian garb.    Every Sunday my brother would get up a _Shikar_ party. Many of those who  joined in it, uninvited, we did not even know. There was a carpenter, a  smith and others from all ranks of society. Bloodshed was the only thing  lacking in this _shikar_, at least I cannot recall any. Its other  appendages were so abundant and satisfying that we felt the absence of  dead or wounded game to be a trifling circumstance of no account. As we  were out from early morning, my sister-in-law furnished us with a  plentiful supply of _luchis_ with appropriate accompaniments; and as  these did not depend upon the fortunes of our chase we never had to  return empty.    The neighbourhood of Maniktola is not wanting in Villa-gardens. We would  turn into any one of these at the end, and high-and low-born alike,  seated on the bathing platform of a tank, would fling ourselves on the  _luchis_ in right good earnest, all that was left of them being the  vessels they were brought in.    Braja Babu was one of the most enthusiastic of these blood-thirstless  _shikaris_. He was the Superintendent of the Metropolitan Institution  and had also been our private tutor for a time. One day he had the happy  idea of accosting the _mali_ (gardener) of a villa-garden into which we  had thus trespassed with: \"Hallo, has uncle been here lately!\" The  _mali_ lost no time in saluting him respectfully before he replied: \"No,  Sir, the master hasn't been lately.\" \"All right, get us some green  cocoanuts off the trees.\" We had a fine drink after our _luchis_ that  day.    A Zamindar in a small way was among our party. He owned a villa on the  river side. One day we had a picnic there together, in defiance of caste  rules. In the afternoon there was a tremendous storm. We stood on the  river-side stairs leading into the water and shouted out songs to its  accompaniment. I cannot truthfully assert that all the seven notes of  the scale could properly be distinguished in Rajnarain Babu's singing,  nevertheless he sent forth his voice and, as in the old Sanskrit works  the text is drowned by the notes, so in Rajnarain Babu's musical efforts  the vigorous play of his limbs and features overwhelmed his feebler  vocal performance; his head swung from side to side marking time, while  the storm played havoc with his flowing beard. It was late in the night  when we turned homewards in a hackney carriage. By that time the storm  clouds had dispersed and the stars twinkled forth. The darkness had  become intense, the atmosphere silent, the village roads deserted, and  the thickets on either side filled with fireflies like a carnival of  sparks scattered in some noiseless revelry.    One of the objects of our association was to encourage the manufacture  of lucifer matches, and similar small industries. For this purpose each  member had to contribute a tenth of his income. Matches had to be made,  but matchwood was difficult to get; for though we all know with what  fiery energy a bundle of _khangras_[40] can be wielded in capable hands,  the thing that burns at its touch is not a lamp wick."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22224"],[0,"At Aboukir and Acre: A Story of Napoleon's Invasion of Egypt (#18)"],[1,"  \"You are right,\" the sheik said gravely. \"Were I to lose Zeila it would  be like the loss of a child; we love each other dearly. I had not  thought of it before. It seemed to me a matter of course that if I rode  in the battle she should carry me as she has done a score of times; but,  as you say, this will not be like fighting in the desert, when man  singles out man, and one's life depends as much upon the intelligence  and quickness of the horse as upon one's skill with spear and scimitar.  Two of my followers shall take our three horses back to our camp in the  desert. You and Sidi are already mounted. One of the men shall give me  his horse, and shall ride on Sidi's; each will then have but one to  lead. If my son and I are killed, the two horses will be valuable  possessions to my wife.\"    Accordingly the saddle was shifted from the sheik's horse to that of one  of his followers, and the latter, with his comrade, was told to start  for the oasis as soon as the rest of the party set out for Cairo.          CHAPTER VI.    THE RISING IN CAIRO.      As soon as a meal had been eaten the Arabs mounted again, rode to a  ferry two miles above the city, crossed there, and joined a large party  of their countrymen, who were gathered at a short distance from the  city. There was much excitement among them, for one of their number had  just returned, bringing news that there was fighting in the town.  Napoleon had gone in the morning to examine the ruins of Old Cairo. On  hearing that there were armed gatherings in various parts of the town,  General Dupres started from the barracks of Birketelfi with a detachment  of dragoons. On his approaching one of these gatherings fire was opened  upon him. He and some of his dragoons were shot, and the rest galloped  with the news to Junot, who was in command, and who at once sent to  acquaint Bonaparte with what was taking place.    The latter returned at once, found the first two gates at which he  arrived in the hands of the insurgents, and making a detour, entered the  town by that of Boulak, and, joining Junot, he ordered the whole of the  troops to be concentrated in the great open space known as the Square of  El-Esbekieh, where were the headquarters and barracks occupied by a  portion of the troops, and the houses in which the staff-officers,  servants, and others lodged. Cannon were placed at the mouth of all the  streets leading from it, and the troops were ordered to remain under  arms all night. The Arabs had, soon after the sheik's party joined them,  entered the town by one of the gates that had been seized by the  insurgents, and established themselves in one of the large open spaces  near the walls. Parties galloped down into the town, and from time to  time brought back news of what was being done.    They reported that no attacks had been made on the troops, but that the  whole town was in a state of insurrection; that the keepers of the  French restaurants had been, for the most part, killed, and all their  houses pillaged; and that the insurgents had gathered in great force in  the cemetery, near the Square of El-Esbekieh. The sheik, with his  followers and many of the other Arabs, rode down to this spot in  readiness to take part in the attack that would, he supposed, be at once  made on the French. Finding that nothing was done, the sheik rode to the  Mosque of Gama El Ashar, where the leaders of the insurrection were  gathered. He dismounted and went in. He found a tumultuous debate going  on, a few being ready for instant attack, while the others urged the  advisability of waiting until the next morning, when many more Arabs,  and the inhabitants of Old Cairo and other places, would have joined  them.    The sheik at once took part in the debate, and urged strongly that the  attack should be made without an instant's delay.    \"You are giving time for the Franks to prepare themselves,\" he said.  \"You have already lost the advantage of surprise. After the first shot  was fired there should not have been a moment of delay; but no shot  should have been fired until you had given us notice. Then together we  should have flung ourselves upon them when they were confused and  dismayed, and had no time to form plans or to gather themselves in one  place. You have already lost that advantage, but do not give them any  longer time. You may be sure that already swift horsemen have been sent  to order the divisions that have just marched to return at once, and by  to-morrow evening they may be here.\"    \"You have spoken truly,\" one of the leaders said, \"that no shot should  have been fired until all was in readiness, and that we should then have  attacked at once with all our force. But the impatience of individuals  has destroyed our plans. The evil has already been done; the Franks are  gathered together. They can receive no reinforcements until to-morrow  night, while in the morning we shall be joined by fully 10,000 men;  therefore nothing would be gained, and much lost, by attacking to-day.\"    The majority of those present agreed with this opinion, and the sheik  returned to the cemetery.    \"You were right,\" he said to Edgar moodily. \"To be successful, such a  rising should have been prompt. They should have wasted no time in  killing tradesmen and plundering their shops. They should have hurled  themselves at once upon the troops and cut them to pieces before they  had time to recover from their surprise. Had they acted thus they might  have succeeded. Now they have allowed the whole of the French to gather,  with their guns, and after what happened in the battle, I fear there can  be little doubt of what will occur when we attack them; but this does  not alter my determination to do my best towards gaining a victory.    \"Even if defeated the affair will not be without advantage. The Franks  will begin to see that, easy as was their first victory, the Egyptians  are not a flock of sheep to be maltreated and robbed without even  venturing to murmur, and that they cannot afford to scatter their forces  all over the country. Moreover, the news that Cairo is in insurrection  will spread through the country and excite a feeling of resistance. Many  will die, but their blood will not have been shed in vain. The French  think that they have conquered Egypt--they have, in fact, but marched  to the capital. They only hold the ground they stand on, and it will  not be long before they feel that even that is trembling under their  feet.\"    Some sheep that had been brought, slung across the horses, were cut up,  fires lighted, and supper eaten, and when two men had been posted as  sentinels, the rest wrapped themselves in their burnooses and lay down  to sleep. Edgar's reflections were not pleasant, and he sat up for some  time talking to Sidi.    \"You think that we shall be beaten,\" the latter said, after they had  talked for some time. \"There is no reason, brother, why you should take  part in a fight that you think will end badly. Why should you not leave  us, and go out of one of the gates in the morning?\"    \"I cannot do that, Sidi. I have, of my own free-will, cast in my lot  with your people. It is thanks to them that I have escaped a prison and  perhaps death, and I cannot withdraw now because there is danger. To  tell you the truth, I am more disgusted at the murder of all the  unfortunate shopkeepers than thinking of any personal danger to-morrow.  There is nothing brave or patriotic in slaying unarmed men, and the  deeds done yesterday are rather those of street ruffians thirsting for  plunder than of men trying to shake off subjection to foreigners. Such  doings as these bring disgrace upon a cause.\"    This view of the case was new to Sidi. In the wars that the Arabs  carried on with each other, or with the tribes of Morocco, there was no  fine distinction between combatants and non-combatants: women as well as  men were killed or carried off as slaves, and that there was anything  wrong in this had never occurred to him.    \"But they are enemies,\" he ventured to protest.    \"They were foreigners, but not enemies,\" Edgar replied. \"Many of them  were settled here long before the French landed, and, like my father,  lived peaceably among you. They are not in any way responsible for the  action of the French government, or of Bonaparte and his army. Among  civilized people, save that after the capture of a town by storm, the  soldiers become maddened and behave sometimes like demons, the lives of  peaceful people are never menaced. Soldiers fight against soldiers, and  not against quiet traders or cultivators of the ground. To me all that  has been done to-day is nothing short of a murderous butchery, and  to-morrow I would much more willingly join in a charge on the rabble who  have done these things than upon the French soldiers, who are for the  most part honest fellows and have injured no one since they came into  the town, though they may have looted houses which they found deserted  by their inhabitants.    \"However, as my country is at war with them, and I have an opportunity  of fighting them, I shall do so, but I would rather have done it with an  Arab force alone out on the desert than in conjunction with these  blood-stained ruffians. However, the matter is settled now, and at any  rate it will be a satisfaction to fight by the side of yourself and your  brave father, who sees as well as I do that defeat is almost certain.\"  So saying he lay down to sleep, but with sore forebodings of what was  likely to take place the next day.    When daylight broke it soon became evident that the insurgents had  neither a leader nor fixed plans. Some were in favour of attacking at  once, while others urged that it would be better for the French to do  so. The argument was, that whereas at present the French were all  assembled, ranged in order, and ready for an attack, they must be broken  up as soon as they issued from the various streets leading into"]]]
