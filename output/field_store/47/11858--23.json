Obviously, our pretty little pocket calendars would never serve to  enumerate all the dates in this vast world.    This splendid globe courses in space at a distance of 775,000,000  kilometers (480,500,000 miles) from the Sun. Hence it is five times  (5.2) as remote from the orb of day as our Earth, and its orbit is five  times vaster than our own. At that distance the Sun subtends a diameter  five times smaller than that which we see, and its surface is  twenty-seven times less extensive; accordingly this planetary abode  receives on an average twenty-seven times less light and heat than we  obtain.    In the telescope Jupiter presents an aspect analogous to that likely to  be exhibited by a world covered with clouds, and enveloped in dense  vapors (Fig. 45).    It is, in fact, the seat of formidable perturbations, of strange  revolutions by which it is perpetually convulsed, for although of more  ancient formation than the Earth, this celestial giant has not yet  arrived at the stable condition of our dwelling-place. Owing to its  considerable volume, this globe has probably preserved its original  heat, revolving in space as an obscure Sun, but perhaps still burning.  In it we see what our own planet must have been in its primordial epoch,  in the pristine times of terrestrial genesis.    [Illustration: FIG. 45.--Telescopic aspect of Jupiter.]    Since its orbital revolution occupies nearly twelve years, Jupiter  comes back into opposition with the Sun every 399 days, _i.e._, 1 year,  34 days, that is with one month and four days' delay each year. At these  periods it is located at the extremity of a straight line which, passing  by the Earth, is prolonged to the Sun. These are the epochs to be  selected for observation. It shines then, all night, like some dazzling  star of the first magnitude, of excessive whiteness: nor can it be  confounded either with Venus, more luminous still (for she is never  visible at midnight, in the full South, but is South-west in the  evening, or South-east in the morning), nor with Mars, whose fires are  ruddy.    In the telescope, the immense planet presents a superb disk that an  enlargement of forty times shows us to be the same size to all  appearance as that of the Moon seen with the unaided eye. Its shape is  not absolutely spherical, but spheroid--that is, flattened at the poles.  The flattening is 1/17.    We know that the Earth's axis dips a certain quantity on the plane of  her orbit, and that it is this inclination that produces the seasons.  Now it is not the same for Jupiter. His axis of rotation remains almost  vertical throughout the course of his year, and results in the complete  absence of climates and seasons. There is neither glacial zone, nor  tropic zone; the position of Jupiter is eternally that of the Earth at  the season of the equinox, and the vast world enjoys, as it were,  perpetual spring. It knows neither the hoar-frost nor the snows of  winter. The heat received from the Sun diminishes gradually from the  equator to the poles without abrupt transitions, and the duration of day  and night is equal there throughout the entire year, under every  latitude. A privileged world, indeed!    It is surrounded by a very dense, thick atmosphere, which undergoes more  extensive variations than could be produced by the Sun at such a  distance. Spectral analysis detects a large amount of water-vapor,  showing that this planet still possesses a very considerable quantity of  intrinsic heat.    Most conspicuous upon this globe are the larger or smaller bands or  markings (gray and white, sometimes tinted yellow, or of a maroon or  chocolate hue) by which its surface is streaked, particularly in the  vicinity of the equator. These different belts vary, and are constantly  modified, either in form or color. Sometimes, they are irregular, and  cut up; at others they are interspersed with more or less brilliant  patches. These patches are not affixed to the surface of the globe, like  the seas and continents of the Earth; nor do they circulate round the  planet like the satellites, in more or less elongated and regular  revolutions, but are relatively mobile, like our clouds in the  atmosphere, while observation of their motion does not give the exact  period of the rotation of Jupiter. Some only appear upon the agitated  disk to vanish very quickly; others subsist for a considerable period.    One has been observed for over a quarter of a century, and appears to be  almost immobile upon this colossal globe. This spot, which was red at  its first appearance, is now pale and ghostly. It is oval (_vide_ Fig.  45) and measures 42,000 kilometers (26,040 miles) in length by 15,000  kilometers (9,300 miles) in width. Hence it is about four times as long  as the diameter of our Earth; that is, relatively to the size of  Jupiter, as are the dimensions of Australia in proportion to our globe.  The discussion of a larger number of observations leads us to see in it  a sort of continent in the making, a scoria recently ejected from the  mobile and still liquid and heated surface of the giant Jupiter. The  patch, however, oscillates perceptibly, and appears to be a floating  island.    We must add that this vast world, like the Sun, _does not rotate all in  one period_. Eight different currents can be perceived upon its surface.  The most rapid is that of the equatorial zone, which accomplishes its  revolution in 9 hours, 50 minutes, 29 seconds. A point situated on the  equator is therefore carried forward at a speed of 12,500 meters (7  miles) per second, and it is this giddy velocity of Jupiter that has  produced the flattening of the poles. From the equator to the poles, the  swiftness of the currents diminishes irregularly, and the difference  amounts to about five minutes between the movement of the equatorial  stream, and that of the northern and southern currents. But what is more  curious still is that the velocity of one and the same stream is subject  to certain fluctuations; thus, in the last quarter of a century, the  speed of the equatorial current has progressively diminished. In 1879,  the velocity was 9 hours, 49 minutes, 59 seconds, and now it is, as we  have already seen, 9 hours, 50 minutes, 29 seconds, which represents a  substantial reduction. The rotation of the red patch, at 25 degrees of  the southern latitude, is effected in 9 hours, 55 minutes, 40 seconds.    We are confronted with a strange and mysterious world. It is the world  of the future.    This giant gravitates in space accompanied by a suite of five  satellites. These are:           Names.   Distance from surface of Jupiter.

On September 9, 1892, Mr. Barnard, astronomer of the Lick Observatory,  California, discovered a new satellite, extremely minute, and very near  the enormous planet. It has so far received no name, and is known as the  fifth, although the four principal are numbered in the order of their  distances.    [Illustration: FIG. 46.--Jupiter and his four principal satellites.]    The four classical satellites are visible in the smallest instruments  (Fig. 46): the third is the most voluminous.    Such is the splendid system of the mighty Jupiter. Once, doubtless, this  fine planet illuminated the troop of worlds that derived their treasure  of vitality from him with his intrinsic light: to-day, however, these  moons in their turn shed upon the extinct central globe the pale soft  light which they receive from our solar focus, illuminating the brief  Jovian nights (which last less than five hours, on account of the  twilight) with their variable brilliancy.    At the distance of the first satellite, Jupiter exhibits a disk  _fourteen hundred times_ vaster than that of the Full Moon! What a  dazzling spectacle, what a fairy scene must the enormous star afford to  the inhabitants of that tiny world! And what a shabby figure must our  Earth and Moon present in the face of such a body, a real miniature of  the great solar system!    Our ancestors were well inspired when they attributed the sovereignty of  Olympus to this majestic planet. His brilliancy corresponds with his  real grandeur. His dominion in the midnight Heavens is unique. Here  again, as for Venus, Mars, and Mercury, astronomy has created the legend  of the fables of mythology.    Let us repeat in conclusion that our Earth becomes practically invisible  for the inhabitants of the other worlds beyond the distance of Jupiter.      SATURN    Turn back now for a moment to the plan of the Solar System.    We had to cross 775 million kilometers (480,000,000 miles) when we left  the Sun, in order to reach the immense orb of Jupiter, which courses in  space at 626 million kilometers (388,000,000 miles) from the terrestrial  orbit. From Jupiter we had to traverse a distance of 646 million  kilometers (400,000,000 miles) in order to reach the marvelous system of  Saturn, where our eyes and thoughts must next alight.    Son of Uranus and Vesta, Saturn was the God of Time and Fate. He is  generally represented as an aged man bearing a scythe. His mythological  character is only the expression of his celestial aspect, as we have  seen for the brilliant Jupiter, for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2527"],[0,"The Sorrows of Young Werther (#18)"],[1,"enthusiasm, ye crowd of pompous declaimers? Enthusiasm! O God!  thou seest my tears. Thou hast allotted us our portion of misery: must  we also have brethren to persecute us, to deprive us of our consolation,  of our trust in thee, and in thy love and mercy? For our trust in the  virtue of the healing root, or in the strength of the vine, what is it  else than a belief in thee from whom all that surrounds us derives its  healing and restoring powers? Father, whom I know not,--who wert once  wont to fill my soul, but who now hidest thy face from me,--call me back  to thee; be silent no longer; thy silence shall not delay a soul which  thirsts after thee. What man, what father, could be angry with a son for  returning to him suddenly, for falling on his neck, and exclaiming, \"I  am here again, my father! forgive me if I have anticipated my journey,  and returned before the appointed time! The world is everywhere the  same,--a scene of labour and pain, of pleasure and reward; but what does  it all avail? I am happy only where thou art, and in thy presence am I  content to suffer or enjoy.\" And wouldst thou, heavenly Father, banish  such a child from thy presence?    DECEMBER 1.    Wilhelm, the man about whom I wrote to you--that man so enviable in his  misfortunes--was secretary to Charlotte's father; and an unhappy passion  for her which he cherished, concealed, and at length discovered, caused  him to be dismissed from his situation. This made him mad. Think, whilst  you peruse this plain narration, what an impression the circumstance has  made upon me! But it was related to me by Albert with as much calmness  as you will probably peruse it.    DECEMBER 4.    I implore your attention. It is all over with me. I can support this  state no longer. To-day I was sitting by Charlotte. She was playing  upon her piano a succession of delightful melodies, with such intense  expression! Her little sister was dressing her doll upon my lap. The  tears came into my eyes. I leaned down, and looked intently at her  wedding-ring: my tears fell--immediately she began to play that  favourite, that divine, air which has so often enchanted me. I felt  comfort from a recollection of the past, of those bygone days when that  air was familiar to me; and then I recalled all the sorrows and the  disappointments which I had since endured. I paced with hasty strides  through the room, my heart became convulsed with painful emotions. At  length I went up to her, and exclaimed With eagerness, \"For Heaven's  sake, play that air no longer!\" She stopped, and looked steadfastly at  me. She then said, with a smile which sunk deep into my heart, \"Werther,  you are ill: your dearest food is distasteful to you. But go, I entreat  you, and endeavour to compose yourself.\" I tore myself away. God, thou  seest my torments, and wilt end them!    DECEMBER 6.    How her image haunts me! Waking or asleep, she fills my entire soul!  Soon as I close my eyes, here, in my brain, where all the nerves of  vision are concentrated, her dark eyes are imprinted. Here--I do not  know how to describe it; but, if I shut my eyes, hers are immediately  before me: dark as an abyss they open upon me, and absorb my senses.    And what is man--that boasted demigod? Do not his powers fail when he  most requires their use? And whether he soar in joy, or sink in sorrow,  is not his career in both inevitably arrested? And, whilst he fondly  dreams that he is grasping at infinity, does he not feel compelled to  return to a consciousness of his cold, monotonous existence?    THE EDITOR TO THE READER.    It is a matter of extreme regret that we want original evidence of the  last remarkable days of our friend; and we are, therefore, obliged  to interrupt the progress of his correspondence, and to supply the  deficiency by a connected narration.    I have felt it my duty to collect accurate information from the mouths  of persons well acquainted with his history. The story is simple; and  all the accounts agree, except in some unimportant particulars. It is  true, that, with respect to the characters of the persons spoken of,  opinions and judgments vary.    We have only, then, to relate conscientiously the facts which our  diligent labour has enabled us to collect, to give the letters of the  deceased, and to pay particular attention to the slightest fragment from  his pen, more especially as it is so difficult to discover the real and  correct motives of men who are not of the common order.    Sorrow and discontent had taken deep root in Werther's soul, and  gradually imparted their character to his whole being. The harmony of  his mind became completely disturbed; a perpetual excitement and mental  irritation, which weakened his natural powers, produced the saddest  effects upon him, and rendered him at length the victim of an exhaustion  against which he struggled with still more painful efforts than he had  displayed, even in contending with his other misfortunes. His mental  anxiety weakened his various good qualities; and he was soon converted  into a gloomy companion, always unhappy and unjust in his ideas, the  more wretched he became. This was, at least, the opinion of Albert's  friends. They assert, moreover, that the character of Albert himself had  undergone no change in the meantime: he was still the same being whom  Werther had loved, honoured, and respected from the commencement. His  love for Charlotte was unbounded: he was proud of her, and desired that  she should be recognised by every one as the noblest of created beings.  Was he, however, to blame for wishing to avert from her every appearance  of suspicion? or for his unwillingness to share his rich prize with  another, even for a moment, and in the most innocent manner? It is  asserted that Albert frequently retired from his wife's apartment during  Werther's visits; but this did not arise from hatred or aversion to  his friend, but only from a feeling that his presence was oppressive to  Werther.    Charlotte's father, who was confined to the house by indisposition, was  accustomed to send his carriage for her, that she might make excursions  in the neighbourhood. One day the weather had been unusually severe, and  the whole country was covered with snow.    Werther went for Charlotte the following morning, in order that, if  Albert were absent, he might conduct her home.    The beautiful weather produced but little impression on his troubled  spirit. A heavy weight lay upon his soul, deep melancholy had taken  possession of him, and his mind knew no change save from one painful  thought to another.    As he now never enjoyed internal peace, the condition of his fellow  creatures was to him a perpetual source of trouble and distress. He  believed he had disturbed the happiness of Albert and his wife; and,  whilst he censured himself strongly for this, he began to entertain a  secret dislike to Albert.    His thoughts were occasionally directed to this point. \"Yes,\" he would  repeat to himself, with ill-concealed dissatisfaction, \"yes, this is,  after all, the extent of that confiding, dear, tender, and sympathetic  love, that calm and eternal fidelity! What do I behold but satiety and  indifference? Does not every frivolous engagement attract him more than  his charming and lovely wife? Does he know how to prize his happiness?  Can he value her as she deserves? He possesses her, it is true, I know  that, as I know much more, and I have become accustomed to the thought  that he will drive me mad, or, perhaps, murder me. Is his friendship  toward me unimpaired? Does he not view my attachment to Charlotte as  an infringement upon his rights, and consider my attention to her as a  silent rebuke to himself? I know, and indeed feel, that he dislikes me,  that he wishes for my absence, that my presence is hateful to him.\"    He would often pause when on his way to visit Charlotte, stand still, as  though in doubt, and seem desirous of returning, but would nevertheless  proceed; and, engaged in such thoughts and soliloquies as we have  described, he finally reached the hunting-lodge, with a sort of  involuntary consent.    Upon one occasion he entered the house; and, inquiring for Charlotte,  he observed that the inmates were in a state of unusual confusion.  The eldest boy informed him that a dreadful misfortune had occurred  at Walheim,--that a peasant had been murdered! But this made little  impression upon him. Entering the apartment, he found Charlotte engaged  reasoning with her father, who, in spite of his infirmity, insisted on  going to the scene of the crime, in order to institute an inquiry. The  criminal was unknown; the victim had been found dead at his own door  that morning. Suspicions were excited: the murdered man had been in  the service of a widow, and the person who had previously filled the  situation had been dismissed from her employment.    As soon as Werther heard this, he exclaimed with great excitement,  \"Is it possible! I must go to the spot--I cannot delay a moment!\" He  hastened to Walheim. Every incident returned vividly to his remembrance;  and he entertained not the slightest doubt that that man was the  murderer to whom he had so often spoken, and for whom he entertained  so much regard. His way took him past the well-known lime trees, to the  house where the body had been carried; and his feelings were greatly  excited at the sight of the fondly recollected spot. That threshold  where the neighbours' children had so often played together was stained  with blood; love and attachment, the noblest feelings of human nature,  had been converted into violence and murder. The huge trees stood there  leafless and covered with hoarfrost; the beautiful hedgerows which  surrounded the old churchyard wall were withered; and the gravestones,  half covered with snow, were visible through the openings.    As he approached the inn, in front of which the whole village was  assembled, screams "]]]
