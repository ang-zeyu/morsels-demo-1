Lambertson calculated them even  higher, but we allowed for the fact that this is the first large mass of  the material to be cast, and lowered them.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"But suppose your lifting cable should break?\" objected the naval  officer. \"The outfit weighs a good many tons.\"    \"You notice that the lower quarter is made of lead. The specific gravity  of the entire globe when sealed up tight with two men in it is only a  little more than unity. In the water its weight is so little that a  three-inch manilla hawser would raise it, let alone a steel cable. I  have another safety device. Granted that the cable should snap, I can  detach the lead from it and it would shoot to the surface like a  rocket.\"    \"How long can you remain under water in it?\"    \"A week, if necessary. I have an oxygen tank and a carbon dioxide  removing apparatus which will keep the air in good condition. The globe  is electrically lighted, and can be heated if necessary. Should my  telephone line become fouled and broken, I have a radio set which will  enable me to communicate with you. I can't see that it is especially  dangerous; not nearly as much so as a submarine.\"    \"What is your object in going down, if I may ask?\"    \"To take pictures and to explore the wreck if we can. The globe is  equipped with huge floodlights and excellent cameras. The salvage people  are having a little trouble and we are trying to help them out.\"    \"You mentioned exploring. Can you leave the globe while it is under  water?\"    \"Yes. There is a locking device for doing so. A man in a diving suit can  enter the lock and fill it with water. Once the external pressure is  released he can open the outer door and step out. Coming back, he seals  the outer door and the man inside blows out the lock and compressed air  and then the inner door can be opened. It is the same principle as a  torpedo tube.\"           *       *       *       *       *    A jangle of bells interrupted them and the _Minneconsin_ slowed down.  Commander Lawrence stepped to the rail and gave a sharp order to the  navigating officer on the bridge. The bells jangled again and the ship's  engines stopped.    \"We are almost over the buoy, Doctor,\" he said.    Dr. Bird nodded and spoke to the two mechanics. With a few final  touches to the apparatus they emerged from the globe and Dr. Bird  entered.    \"Come on, Carnes,\" he called. \"No backing out at the last minute.\"    Carnes stepped forward with a sickly smile and joined the Doctor in the  huge sphere.    \"All right, boys; close her up.\"    The mechanics swung the outer door into place with a crane. Both the  edge of the door and the surface against which it fitted had been ground  flat and were in addition faced with soft rubber. Bolts were fastened in  the door which passed through holes in the main sphere, and Dr. Bird  spun nuts onto them and tightened them with a heavy wrench. He and  Carnes lifted the smaller inner door into place and bolted it tight. Dr.  Bird stepped to the telephone.    \"Lower away,\" he directed.    From a boom attached to the _Minneconsin's_ forward fighting top, a huge  steel cable swung down, and the latch at the end of the cable was closed  over a vitrilene ring which was fastened to the top of the sphere. The  cable tightened and the globe with the two men in it was lifted over the  side of the battleship and lowered gently into the water. Carnes  involuntarily ducked and threw up his hand as the waters closed over  them. Dr. Bird laughed.    \"Look up, Carnes,\" he said.    Carnes gasped as he looked up and saw the surface of the water above  him. Dr. Bird laughed again and turned to the telephone.    \"Lower away,\" he said. \"Everything is tight.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The globe descended into the depths of the sea. Darker and darker it  grew until only a faint twilight glow filled the sphere. A dark bulk  loomed before them. Dr. Bird snapped on one of his huge floodlights and  pointed.    \"The _Arethusa_,\" he said.    The ill-fated vessel lay on her side with a huge jagged hole torn in her  fabric amidships.    \"That's where her boilers burst,\" explained the Doctor. \"Luckily we have  a hard bottom to deal with. Let's see if we can locate any of Mitchell's  sea serpents.\"    He turned on other flood lights and swept the bottom of the sea with  them. The huge beams bored out into the water for a quarter of a mile,  but nothing unusual was to be seen. Dr. Bird turned his attention again  to the wreck.    \"Things look normal from this side,\" he said after a prolonged scrutiny.  \"I'll have the _Minneconsin_ steam around it while we look it over.\"    In response to his telephone orders the ship above them swung around the  wreck in a circle, and Carnes and the Doctor viewed each side in turn.  But nothing of a suspicious nature made its appearance. The sphere  stopped opposite the hole in the side and Dr. Bird turned to Carnes.    \"I'm going to put on a diving suit and explore that wreck,\" he said. \"If  there ever was any danger, it isn't apparent now; and I can't find out  anything until I get inside.\"    \"Don't do it, Doctor!\" cried Carnes. \"Remember what happened to the  other divers!\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"We don't know what happened to them, Carnes. No matter what it was,  there is no danger apparent right now, and I've got to get into that  ship before I can get any real information. We could have lowered an  under-sea camera and learned as much as we have so far.\"    \"Let me go instead of you, Doctor.\"    \"I'm sorry to refuse you, old dear, but frankly, I wouldn't trust your  judgment as to what you had seen if you went alone; and we can't both  go.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"If we both went, who would work the air to let us back in? No, this is  a one-man job and I'm the one to do it. While I am gone, keep a sharp  lookout, and if you see anything unusual call me at once.\"    \"How can I call you?\"    \"On this small radio phone. A pair of receivers tuned to the right  wave-length are in my diving helmet, and I will be able to hear you  although I can't reply. I won't be gone long: I have only a small air  tank, large enough to keep me going for thirty minutes. Now help me into  my suit and keep a sharp watch. A timely warning may save my life if  anything happens.\"    With Carnes' assistance, Dr. Bird donned a deep-sea diving outfit and  screwed down the helmet. He crawled through the inner door into the lock  and lifted the inner door into place. Carnes fastened the door with nuts  and the Doctor opened a pair of valves in the outer door and filled the  lock with water. He removed the outer door; and, taking in one hand a  steel-shod twelve-foot pike with a hook on the end, and in the other a  waterproof flashlight, he sallied forth. As he left the shell he paused  for a moment, and then returned and picked up the heavy wrench with  which he had removed the nuts holding the outer door into place. He  fastened the tool to the belt of his suit. Then, with a wave of his hand  toward the detective, he approached the hulk.    The hole in the side was too high for him to reach, but he hooked the  end of his pike in one of the joints of the _Arethusa's_ plates and  climbed slowly and painfully up the side of the vessel. As he  disappeared into the hull, Carnes realized with a sudden start that he  had been watching his friend and neglecting the duty imposed on him of  keeping a sharp watch. He turned quickly to the floodlights and searched  the sea bottom.           *       *       *       *       *    Nothing appeared, and the minutes moved as slowly as hours should.  Carnes felt that he had been submerged alone for weeks, and his nerves  grew so tense that he felt that he would scream in another instant. A  sudden thought sobered him like a dash of cold water. If he screamed,  Dr. Bird would take it for an alarm signal and possibly be afraid to  emerge from the vessel. His watch showed him that the Doctor had been  gone for twenty-five minutes and he moved slowly to the radio  transmitter.    \"Dr. Bird,\" he said slowly and distinctly, \"you have been gone nearly  thirty minutes. Nothing alarming has appeared but I will feel better  when I see you coming back.\"    He glued his eyes on the opening in the ship's side and waited. Five  minutes passed, and then ten, with no signs of the Doctor. Carnes moved  again to the receiver.    \"It has been over half an hour. Doctor,\" he cried in a pleading voice.  \"If you are all right, for God's sake show yourself. I am frantic with  worry.\"    Another five minutes passed, and the sweat dripped in a steady stream  from the detective's chin. Suddenly he gave a sob of relief and sank  back against the side of the globe. A bulky figure showed at the edge of  the hole, and Dr. Bird climbed slowly and heavily out of the hold and  dropped to the sea bottom. He lay prone for a moment before he rose and  made his way with evident effort toward the sphere. He entered the  compartment and with a heroic effort lifted the outer door into place,  and feebly and with fumbling fingers placed nuts on the bolts. His hands  wandered uncertainly toward the valves and closed the upper one. He  waved his hand toward Carnes and sank in a heap on the floor of the  lock.           *       *       *       *       *    With trembling hands Carnes connected the air and opened the valve. Air  flowed into the lock and the water was gradually forced out. When the  lock was empty, he waited for Dr. Bird to close the outer valve but the  Doctor did not move. Carnes tore at the bolts which held the inner door  and threw his weight against it. It held against his assault, and he  thought frantically. An inspiration came to him, and he disconnected  the air valve. With a whistling rush, the air"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/307"],[0,"Three Elephant Power, and Other Stories (#18)"],[1,"then I'd understand you.\"    Furthermore, according to Billy, they reckoned the rainfall in the  Territory by yards, not inches. He had seen blackfellows who could  jump at least three inches higher than anyone else had ever seen a  blackfellow jump, and every bushman has seen or personally known  a blackfellow who could jump over six feet. Billy had seen bigger  droughts, better country, fatter cattle, faster horses, and cleverer  dogs, than any other man on the Clarence River. But one night when the  rain was on the roof, and the river was rising with a moaning sound, and  the men were gathered round the fire in the hut smoking and staring at  the coals, Billy turned himself loose and gave us his masterpiece.    \"I was drovin' with cattle from Mungrybanbone to old Corlett's station  on the Buckadowntown River\" (Billy always started his stories with some  paralysing bush names). \"We had a thousand head of store-cattle, wild,  mountain-bred wretches that'd charge you on sight; they were that handy  with their horns they could skewer a mosquito. There was one or two  one-eyed cattle among 'em--and you know how a one-eyed beast always  keeps movin' away from the mob, pokin' away out to the edge of them so  as they won't git on his blind side, so that by stirrin' about he keeps  the others restless.    \"They had been scared once or twice, and stampeded and gave us all we  could do to keep them together; and it was wet and dark and thundering,  and it looked like a real bad night for us. It was my watch. I was on  one side of the cattle, like it might be here, with a small bit of a  fire; and my mate, Barcoo Jim, he was right opposite on the other side  of the cattle, and had gone to sleep under a log. The rest of the men  were in the camp fast asleep. Every now and again I'd get on my horse  and prowl round the cattle quiet like, and they seemed to be settled  down all right, and I was sitting by my fire holding my horse and  drowsing, when all of a sudden a blessed 'possum ran out from some  saplings and scratched up a tree right alongside me. I was half-asleep,  I suppose, and was startled; anyhow, never thinking what I was doing, I  picked up a firestick out of the fire and flung it at the 'possum.    \"Whoop! Before you could say Jack Robertson, that thousand head of  cattle were on their feet, and made one wild, headlong, mad rush right  over the place where poor old Barcoo Jim was sleeping. There was no  time to hunt up materials for the inquest; I had to keep those cattle  together, so I sprang into the saddle, dashed the spurs into the old  horse, dropped my head on his mane, and sent him as hard as he could leg  it through the scrub to get to the lead of the cattle and steady them.  It was brigalow, and you know what that is.    \"You know how the brigalow grows,\" continued Bill; \"saplings about as  thick as a man's arm, and that close together a dog can't open his mouth  to bark in 'em. Well, those cattle swept through that scrub, levelling  it like as if it had been cleared for a railway line. They cleared  a track a quarter of a mile wide, and smashed every stick, stump and  sapling on it. You could hear them roaring and their hoofs thundering  and the scrub smashing three or four miles off.    \"And where was I? I was racing parallel with the cattle, with my head  down on the horse's neck, letting him pick his way through the scrub in  the pitchy darkness. This went on for about four miles. Then the cattle  began to get winded, and I dug into the old stock-horse with the spurs,  and got in front, and began to crack the whip and sing out, so as to  steady them a little; after awhile they dropped slower and slower, and I  kept the whip going. I got them all together in a patch of open country,  and there I rode round and round 'em all night till daylight.    \"And how I wasn't killed in the scrub, goodness only knows; for a man  couldn't ride in the daylight where I did in the dark. The cattle were  all knocked about--horns smashed, legs broken, ribs torn; but they were  all there, every solitary head of 'em; and as soon as the daylight broke  I took 'em back to the camp--that is, all that could travel, because I  had to leave a few broken-legged ones.\"    Billy paused in his narrative. He knew that some suggestions would be  made, by way of compromise, to tone down the awful strength of the yarn,  and he prepared himself accordingly. His motto was \"No surrender\"; he  never abated one jot of his statements; if anyone chose to remark on  them, he made them warmer and stronger, and absolutely flattened out the  intruder.    \"That was a wonderful bit of ridin' you done, Billy,\" said one of the  men at last, admiringly. \"It's a wonder you wasn't killed. I suppose  your clothes was pretty well tore off your back with the scrub?\"    \"Never touched a twig,\" said Billy.    \"Ah!\" faltered the inquirer, \"then no doubt you had a real ringin' good  stock-horse that could take you through a scrub like that full-split in  the dark, and not hit you against anything.\"    \"No, he wasn't a good un,\" said Billy decisively, \"he was the worst  horse in the camp. Terrible awkward in the scrub he was, always fallin'  down on his knees; and his neck was so short you could sit far back on  him and pull his ears.\"    Here that interrogator retired hurt; he gave Billy best. After a pause  another took up the running.    \"How did your mate get on, Billy? I s'pose he was trampled to a mummy!\"    \"No,\" said Billy, \"he wasn't hurt a bit. I told you he was sleeping  under the shelter of a log. Well, when those cattle rushed they swept  over that log a thousand strong; and every beast of that herd took the  log in his stride and just missed landing on Barcoo Jimmy by about four  inches.\"    The men waited a while and smoked, to let this statement soak well into  their systems; at last one rallied and had a final try.    \"It's a wonder then, Billy,\" he said, \"that your mate didn't come after  you and give you a hand to steady the cattle.\"    \"Well, perhaps it was,\" said Billy, \"only that there was a bigger wonder  than that at the back of it.\"    \"What was that?\"    \"My mate never woke up all through it.\"    Then the men knocked the ashes out of their pipes and went to bed.          DONE FOR THE DOUBLE    by Knott Gold    Author of \"Flogged for a Furlong\", \"Won by a Winker\", etc., etc.          Chapter I.--WANTED, A PONY      Algernon de Montgomery Smythers was a merchant, wealthy beyond the  dreams of avarice. Other merchants might dress more lavishly, and wear  larger watch chains; but the bank balance is the true test of mercantile  superiority, and in a trial of bank balances Algernon de Montgomery  Smythers represented Tyson at seven stone. He was unbeatable.    He lived in comfort, not to say luxury. He had champagne for breakfast  every morning, and his wife always slept with a pair of diamond earrings  worth a small fortune in her ears. It is things like these that show  true gentility.    Though they had been married many years, the A. de M. Smythers had but  one child--a son and heir. No Christmas Day was allowed to pass by his  doting parents without a gift to young Algy of some trifle worth about  150 pounds, less the discount for cash. He had six play-rooms, all  filled with the most expensive toys and ingenious mechanical devices.  He had a phonograph that could hail a ship out at the South Head, and a  mechanical parrot that sang \"The Wearing of the Green\". And still he was  not happy.    Sometimes, in spite of the vigilance of his four nurses and six  under-nurses, he would escape into the street, and run about with the  little boys he met there. One day he gave one of them a sovereign for  a locust. Certainly the locust was a \"double-drummer\", and could deafen  the German Band when shaken up judiciously; still, it was dear at a  sovereign.    It is ever thus.    What we have we do not value, and what other people have we are not  strong enough to take from them.    Such is life.    Christmas was approaching, and the question of Algy's Christmas present  agitated the bosom of his parents. He already had nearly everything a  child could want; but one morning a bright inspiration struck Algy's  father. Algy should have a pony.    With Mr. Smythers to think was to act. He was not a man who believed  in allowing grass to grow under his feet. His motto was, \"Up and be  doing--somebody.\" So he put an advertisement in the paper that same day.    \"Wanted, a boy's pony. Must be guaranteed sound, strong, handsome,  intelligent. Used to trains, trams, motors, fire engines, and motor  'buses. Any failure in above respects will disqualify. Certificate of  birth required as well as references from last place. Price no object.\"          Chapter II.--BLINKY BILL'S SACRIFICE      Down in a poverty-stricken part of the city lived Blinky Bill, the  horse-dealer.    His yard was surrounded by loose-boxes made of any old timber,  galvanized iron, sheets of roofing-felt, and bark he could gather  together.    He kept all sorts of horses, except good sorts. There were harness  horses, that wouldn't pull, and saddle horses that wouldn't go--or, if  they went, used to fall down. Nearly every animal about the place had  something the matter with it.    When the bailiff dropped in, as he did every two or three weeks, Bill  and he would go out together, and \"have a punt\" on some of Bill's  ponies, or on somebody else's ponies--the latter for choice. But  periodical punts and occasional sales of horses would not keep the wolf  from the door. Ponies keep on eating whether they are winning or not and  Blinky Bill had got down to the very last pitch of desperation when he  saw the advertisement mentioned at the end of last chapter.    It was like a ray of hope to him. At once there flashed upon him what he  must do.    He must make a great sacrifice; he must sell Sausage II.    Sausage II. was the greatest thirteen-two pony of the day. Time and"]]]
