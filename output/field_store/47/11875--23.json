Where  this happens, the reasons for non-compliance ought to be offered in a  plain, strong, good natured manner. There is at least the chance of  success from being heard. But should those reasons be rejected, or the  hearing them refused, and silence on the subject enjoined, which is most  probable, few people caring to hear what they know to be right, when  they are determined not to be convinced by it--obey the injunction, and  urge not the argument farther. Keep, however, steady to your principles,  and suffer neither persuasion nor threats to prevail on you to act  contrary to them. All commands repugnant to the laws of christianity,  it is your indispensable duty to disobey. All requests that are  inconsistent with prudence, or incompatible with the rank and character  which you ought to maintain in life, it is your interest to refuse. A  compliance with the former would be criminal, a consent to the latter  highly indiscreet; and it might thereby subject you to general censure.  For a man, capable of requiring, from his wife, what he knows to be in  itself wrong, is equally capable of throwing the whole blame of such  misconduct on her, and of afterwards upbraiding her for a behavior, to  which he will, upon the same principle, disown that he has been  accessary. Many similar instances have come within the compass of my own  observation. In things of less material nature, that are neither  criminal in themselves, nor pernicious in their consequences, always  acquiesce, if insisted on, however disagreeable they may be to your own  temper and inclination. Such a compliance will evidently prove that your  refusal, in the other cases, proceeds not from a spirit of  contradiction, but merely from a just regard to that superior duty which  can never be infringed with impunity.    \"As the want of understanding is by no art to be concealed, by no  address to be disguised, it might be supposed impossible for a woman of  sense to unite herself to a person whose defect, in this instance, must  render that sort of rational society, which constitutes the chief  happiness of such an union, impossible. Yet here, how often has the  weakness of female judgment been conspicuous! The advantages of great  superiority in rank or fortune have frequently proved so irresistible a  temptation, as, in opinion, to outweigh, not only the folly, but even  the vices of its possessor--a grand mistake, ever tacitly acknowledged  by a subsequent repentance, when the expected pleasures of affluence,  equipage, and all the glittering pageantry, have been experimentally  found insufficient to make amends for the want of that constant  satisfaction which results from the social joy of conversing with a  reasonable friend!    \"But however weak this motive must be acknowledged, it is more excusable  than another, which, I fear, has sometimes had an equal influence on the  mind--I mean so great a love of sway, as to induce her to give the  preference to a person of weak intellectuals, in hopes of holding,  uncontrolled, the reins of government. The expectation is, in fact, ill  grounded. Obstinacy and pride are generally the companions of folly. The  silliest people are often the most tenacious of their opinions, and,  consequently, the hardest of all others to be managed. But admit the  contrary, the principle is in itself bad. It tends to invert the order  of nature, and to counteract the design of Providence.    \"A woman can never be seen in a more ridiculous light than when she  appears to govern her husband. If, unfortunately, the superiority of  understanding is on her side, the apparent consciousness of that  superiority betrays a weakness, that renders her contemptible in the  sight of every considerate person, and it may, very probably, fix in his  mind a dislike never to be eradicated. In such a case, if it should ever  be your own, remember that some degree of dissimulation is commendable,  so far as to let your husband's defects appear unobserved. When he  judges wrong, never flatly contradict, but lead him insensibly into  another opinion, in so discreet a manner, that it may seem entirely his  own, and let the whole credit of every prudent determination rest on  him, without indulging the foolish vanity of claiming any merit to  yourself. Thus a person of but an indifferent capacity, may be so  assisted, as, in many instances, to shine with borrowed lustre, scarce  distinguishable from the native, and by degrees he may be brought into a  kind of mechanical method of acting properly, in all the common  occurrences of life. Odd as this position may seem, it is founded in  fact. I have seen the method successfully practised by more than one  person, where a weak mind, on the governed side, has been so prudently  set off as to appear the sole director; like the statue of the Delphic  god, which was thought to give forth its own oracles, whilst the humble  priest, who lent his voice, was by the shrine concealed, nor sought a  higher glory than a supposed obedience to the power he would be thought  to serve.\"      A LETTER TO A NEW MARRIED MAN.    I received the news of your marriage with infinite delight, and hope  that the sincerity with which I wish you happiness, may excuse the  liberty I take in giving you a few rules, whereby more certainly to  obtain it. I see you smile at my wrong-headed kindness, and, reflecting  on the charms of your bride, cry out in a rapture, that you are happy  enough without any rules. I know you are. But after one of the forty  years, which I hope you will pass pleasingly together, is over, this  letter may come in turn, and rules for felicity may not be found  unnecessary, however some of them may appear impracticable.    Could that kind of love be kept alive through the marriage state, which  makes the charm of a single one, the sovereign good would no longer be  sought for; in the union of two faithful lovers it would be found: but  reason shows that this is impossible, and experience informs us that it  never was so; we must preserve it as long, and supply it as happily as  we can.    When your present violence of passion subsides, however, and a more cool  and tranquil affection takes its place, be not hasty to censure yourself  as indifferent, or to lament yourself as unhappy; you have lost that  only which it was impossible to retain, and it were graceless amid the  pleasures of a prosperous summer to regret the blossoms of a transient  spring. Neither unwarily condemn your bride's insipidity till you have  recollected that no object however sublime, no sounds however charming,  can continue to transport us with delight when they no longer strike us  with novelty. The skill to renovate the powers of pleasing is said  indeed to be possessed by some women in an eminent degree; but the  artifices of maturity are seldom seen to adorn the innocence of youth:  you have made your choice, and ought to approve it.    Satiety follows quickly upon the heels of possession; and to be happy,  we must always have something in view. The person of your lady is  already all your own, and will not grow more pleasing in your eyes I  doubt, though the rest of your sex will think her handsome for these  dozen of years. Turn therefore all your attention to her mind, which  will daily grow brighter by polishing. Study some easy science together,  and acquire a similarity of tastes while you enjoy a community of  pleasures. You will by this means have many images in common, and be  freed from the necessity of separating to find amusement. Nothing is so  dangerous to wedded love as the possibility of either being happy out of  the company of the other: endeavor therefore, to cement the present  intimacy on every side; let your wife never be kept ignorant of your  income, your expenses, your friendships, or aversions; let her know your  very faults, but make them amiable by your virtues; consider all  concealment as a breach of fidelity; let her never have any thing to  find out in your character; and remember, that from the moment one of  the partners turns spy upon the other, they have commenced a state of  hostility.    Seek not for happiness in singularity; and dread a refinement of wisdom  as a deviation into folly. Listen not to those sages who advise you  always to scorn the counsel of a woman, and if you comply with her  requests pronounce you to be wife-ridden.    I said that the person of your lady would not grow more pleasing to you;  but pray let her never suspect that it grows less so: that a woman will  pardon an affront to her understanding much sooner than one to her  person, is well known; nor will any of us contradict the assertion. All  our attainments, all our arts, are employed to gain and keep the heart  of man: and what mortification can exceed the disappointment, if the end  be not obtained? There is no reproof however pointed, no punishment  however severe, that a woman of spirit will not prefer to neglect; and  if she can endure it without complaint, it only proves that she means to  make herself amends by the attention of others for the slights of her  husband. For this, and for every reason, it behoves a married man not to  let his politeness fail, though his ardor may abate, but to retain at  least that general civility towards his own lady which he is so willing  to pay to every other, and not show a wife of eighteen or twenty years  old, that every man in company can treat her with more complaisance than  he, who so often vowed to her eternal fondness.    It is not my opinion that a young woman should be indulged in every wild  wish of her gay heart or giddy head; but contradiction may be softened  by domestic kindness, and quiet pleasures substituted in the place of  noisy ones. Public amusements are not indeed so expensive as is  sometimes imagined, but they tend to alienate the minds of married  people from each other. A well chosen society of friends and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2612"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 3 (#18)"],[1,"these very faults may perhaps  appear to be merits, when we take into consideration the passions and  prejudices of those for whom the Toleration Act was framed. This  law, abounding with contradictions which every smatterer in political  philosophy can detect, did what a law framed by the utmost skill of the  greatest masters of political philosophy might have failed to do. That  the provisions which have been recapitulated are cumbrous, puerile,  inconsistent with each other, inconsistent with the true theory of  religious liberty, must be acknowledged. All that can be said in their  defence is this; that they removed a vast mass of evil without shocking  a vast mass of prejudice; that they put an end, at once and for ever,  without one division in either House of Parliament, without one riot in  the streets, with scarcely one audible murmur even from the classes most  deeply tainted with bigotry, to a persecution which had raged during  four generations, which had broken innumerable hearts, which had made  innumerable firesides desolate, which had filled the prisons with men  of whom the world was not worthy, which had driven thousands of those  honest, diligent and godfearing yeomen and artisans, who are the true  strength of a nation, to seek a refuge beyond the ocean among the  wigwams of red Indians and the lairs of panthers. Such a defence,  however weak it may appear to some shallow speculators, will probably be  thought complete by statesmen.    The English, in 1689, were by no means disposed to admit the doctrine  that religious error ought to be left unpunished. That doctrine was just  then more unpopular than it had ever been. For it had, only a few months  before, been hypocritically put forward as a pretext for persecuting the  Established Church, for trampling on the fundamental laws of the realm,  for confiscating freeholds, for treating as a crime the modest exercise  of the right of petition. If a bill had then been drawn up granting  entire freedom of conscience to all Protestants, it may be confidently  affirmed that Nottingham would never have introduced such a bill; that  all the bishops, Burnet included, would have voted against it; that  it would have been denounced, Sunday after Sunday, from ten thousand  pulpits, as an insult to God and to all Christian men, and as a license  to the worst heretics and blasphemers; that it would have been condemned  almost as vehemently by Bates and Baxter as by Ken and Sherlock; that it  would have been burned by the mob in half the market places of England;  that it would never have become the law of the land, and that it would  have made the very name of toleration odious during many years to the  majority of the people. And yet, if such a bill had been passed, what  would it have effected beyond what was effected by the Toleration Act?    It is true that the Toleration Act recognised persecution as the rule,  and granted liberty of conscience only as the exception. But it is  equally true that the rule remained in force only against a few hundreds  of Protestant dissenters, and that the benefit of the exceptions  extended to hundreds of thousands.    It is true that it was in theory absurd to make Howe sign thirty-four or  thirty-five of the Anglican articles before he could preach, and to let  Penn preach without signing one of those articles. But it is equally  true that, under this arrangement, both Howe and Penn got as entire  liberty to preach as they could have had under the most philosophical  code that Beccaria or Jefferson could have framed.    The progress of the bill was easy. Only one amendment of grave  importance was proposed. Some zealous churchmen in the Commons suggested  that it might be desirable to grant the toleration only for a term of  seven years, and thus to bind over the nonconformists to good behaviour.  But this suggestion was so unfavourably received that those who made it  did not venture to divide the House. [84]    The King gave his consent with hearty satisfaction: the bill became law;  and the Puritan divines thronged to the Quarter Sessions of every county  to swear and sign. Many of them probably professed their assent to the  Articles with some tacit reservations. But the tender conscience of  Baxter would not suffer him to qualify, till he had put on record an  explanation of the sense in which he understood every proposition which  seemed to him to admit of misconstruction. The instrument delivered by  him to the Court before which he took the oaths is still extant,  and contains two passages of peculiar interest. He declared that his  approbation of the Athanasian Creed was confined to that part which was  properly a Creed, and that he did not mean to express any assent to  the damnatory clauses. He also declared that he did not, by signing the  article which anathematizes all who maintain that there is any other  salvation than through Christ, mean to condemn those who entertain a  hope that sincere and virtuous unbelievers may be admitted to partake  in the benefits of Redemption. Many of the dissenting clergy of London  expressed their concurrence in these charitable sentiments. [85]    The history of the Comprehension Bill presents a remarkable contrast to  the history of the Toleration Bill. The two bills had a common origin,  and, to a great extent, a common object. They were framed at the same  time, and laid aside at the same time: they sank together into oblivion;  and they were, after the lapse of several years, again brought together  before the world. Both were laid by the same peer on the table of the  Upper House; and both were referred to the same select committee. But  it soon began to appear that they would have widely different fates.  The Comprehension Bill was indeed a neater specimen of legislative  workmanship than the Toleration Bill, but was not, like the Toleration  Bill, adapted to the wants, the feelings, and the prejudices of the  existing generation. Accordingly, while the Toleration Bill found  support in all quarters, the Comprehension Bill was attacked from all  quarters, and was at last coldly and languidly defended even by those  who had introduced it. About the same time at which the Toleration bill  became law with the general concurrence of public men, the Comprehension  Bill was, with a concurrence not less general, suffered to drop. The  Toleration Bill still ranks among those great statutes which are epochs  in our constitutional history. The Comprehension Bill is forgotten. No  collector of antiquities has thought it worth preserving. A single copy,  the same which Nottingham presented to the peers, is still among our  parliamentary records, but has been seen by only two or three persons  now living. It is a fortunate circumstance that, in this copy, almost  the whole history of the Bill can be read. In spite of cancellations  and interlineations, the original words can easily be distinguished from  those which were inserted in the committee or on the report. [86]    The first clause, as it stood when the bill was introduced, dispensed  all the ministers of the Established Church from the necessity of  subscribing the Thirty-nine Articles. For the Articles was substituted  a Declaration which ran thus; \"I do approve of the doctrine and  worship and government of the Church of England by law established,  as containing all things necessary to salvation; and I promise, in the  exercise of my ministry, to preach and practice according thereunto.\"  Another clause granted similar indulgence to the members of the two  universities.    Then it was provided that any minister who had been ordained after  the Presbyterian fashion might, without reordination, acquire all the  privileges of a priest of the Established Church. He must, however,  be admitted to his new functions by the imposition of the hands of a  bishop, who was to pronounce the following form of words; \"Take thou  authority to preach the word of God, and administer the sacraments, and  to perform all other ministerial offices in the Church of England.\"  The person thus admitted was to be capable of holding any rectory or  vicarage in the kingdom.    Then followed clauses providing that a clergyman might, except in a few  churches of peculiar dignity, wear the surplice or not as he thought  fit, that the sign of the cross might be omitted in baptism, that  children might be christened, if such were the wish of their parents,  without godfathers or godmothers, and that persons who had a scruple  about receiving the Eucharist kneeling might receive it sitting.    The concluding clause was drawn in the form of a petition. It was  proposed that the two Houses should request the King and Queen to issue  a commission empowering thirty divines of the Established Church  to revise the liturgy, the canons, and the constitution of the  ecclesiastical courts, and to recommend such alterations as might on  inquiry appear to be desirable.    The bill went smoothly through the first stages. Compton, who, since  Sancroft had shut himself up at Lambeth, was virtually Primate,  supported Nottingham with ardour. [87] In the committee, however, it  appeared that there was a strong body of churchmen, who were determined  not to give up a single word or form; to whom it seemed that the prayers  were no prayers without the surplice, the babe no Christian if not  marked with the cross, the bread and wine no memorials of redemption  or vehicles of grace if not received on bended knee. Why, these persons  asked, was the docile and affectionate son of the Church to be disgusted  by seeing the irreverent practices of a conventicle introduced into her  majestic choirs? Why should his feelings, his prejudices, if prejudices  they were, be less considered than the whims of schismatics? If, as  Burnet and men like Burnet were never weary of repeating, indulgence  was due to a weak brother, was it less due to the brother whose  weakness"]]]
