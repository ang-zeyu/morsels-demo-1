Fighting also took place near Karunga in March, and on this       occasion the German force was driven back in disorder and       with heavy loss into their own territory, while Kisu--which       had been captured by the Germans--was reoccupied after the       defeat of Karunga. On Jan. 10 the large Island of Mafia, off       the coast of the German colony, was taken by the British and       is being administered by them.

It will be       remembered that the general scheme for the attack on Bukoba       was to be a simultaneous advance on the part of two forces,       one starting from the line of the Kagera River, south of       Uganda, the other starting on steamers from Kisumu.         The junction of the two forces was successfully       accomplished, and the attack took place on June 22. During       the action the enemy received reinforcements which brought       his force up to 400 rifles, and he made a most determined       resistance, the Arabs especially fighting most bravely. They       were, however, heavily outnumbered, and eventually the whole       force broke and fled, utterly demoralized.... Our troops       distinguished themselves greatly, both in the arduous march       from the Kagera and in the subsequent fighting. A telegram       was sent on June 28 from Lord Kitchener to Major Gen.       Tighe, commanding the troops in British East Africa,       congratulating him on the success of the operations.    [Illustration: Conquered German African Territory.]      V. THE PERSIAN GULF AND MESOPOTAMIA.    Turkey's entry into the war has had four results: 1, The annexation of  Cyprus (previously a protectorate) by Britain on Nov. 5; 2, the  British expedition against Turkish territory on the Persian Gulf two  weeks later; 3, the loss of Turkey's suzerainty over Egypt, which  became a British protectorate under a Sultan on Dec. 17, and, 4, the  attack on the Gallipoli Peninsula, still in progress.    An excellent summary of the Persian Gulf expedition is given in The  Sphere, May 15:         The Shatt-el-Arab, (the united Euphrates and Tigris,) for       the greater part of its course, forms the boundary between       Persia and Turkey. Some twenty miles below Basra (or       Bussorah) it is joined by the Kasun, near whose course,       about a hundred miles from its mouth, are the Anglo-Persian       Company's oil fields.         The effective protection of these is necessarily an object       of vital importance. It was also of considerable importance       to create a diversion which should cause the Osmanli       Generals to feel uneasiness as to a possible advance up the       Euphrates. Whether more than the occupation of Basra and the       protection of the oil fields was or is intended cannot, of       course, be at present definitely stated.         The expeditionary force, under Lieut. Gen. Sir Arthur       Barrett, consisted--apparently--of three Indo-British       infantry brigades, a brigade of Indian cavalry, and       artillery and auxiliary services in proportion--in all       probability some 15,000 to 18,000 men. It included at least       three British battalions--the Second Dorsets, the Second       Norfolks, and the Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry.         The advanced brigade reached the Shatt-el-Arab on Nov. 7,       and after a brief fight occupied Fao, a few miles up the       river. On the 9th a night attack was made upon it by a force       from Basra, which was easily beaten off. Shortly afterwards       the main body of the expeditionary force began to arrive,       and by the 16th it had entirely disembarked at Saniyeh, a       place above Fao.         The weather was wretched. Rain converted the alluvial flats       into a wilderness of mud. The men were drenched and caked       with the riverine clay, the very rifles were often choked.         Meanwhile the advance guard carried out a reconnoissance up       the river and located the enemy in position at Sahilo, about       nine miles distant. They numbered about 5,000 men, with       twelve guns, under General Subr Bey, the Vali (Governor) of       Basra. The reconnoissance carried an advanced position with       a loss of sixty killed and wounded, and withdrew unmolested       to report.         On the 17th General Barrett paraded for the attack the bulk       of his force. After a trying march through a veritable       quagmire, the troops sometimes up to their waists in slush,       the division at about 9 A.M. came within range of the       Turkish position, and the leading brigade, the Belgaum,       (Major Gen. Fry,) deployed for attack.         The ground was absolutely open, and the Turks had a perfect       field of fire. On our side the men had the greatest       difficulty in getting forward through the clayey mud-beds       and the worn-out horses could not bring up the field       artillery. Nevertheless, the Belgaum brigade steadily       advanced, and the attack being presently supported by other       troops and assisted by the first of the two gunboats on the       river, at last closed upon the Turkish intrenchments and       carried them, capturing two guns and one hundred prisoners,       besides inflicting a very heavy loss in killed and wounded.         The retreat of the enemy was assisted by a mirage which       disconcerted our gunners. Subr Bey retreated on Basra, but       he had no hope of being able to hold the big spreading place       with his small force, and evacuated it. He retreated to       Kurna, where the Tigris joins the Euphrates. There he       intrenched himself. His main body was in Kurna, a large       village encircled by palm groves, in the marshy angle formed       by the two rivers, with a strong detachment in the       straggling village of Mazera, on the left bank of the       Tigris.    [Illustration: The scene of the Persian Gulf Campaign.]         On Dec. 7 General Fry advanced upon the Kurna position. The       defenders of Mazera made a hard fight of it, assisted by the       strength of their position among a maze of pottery works       backed up by the ubiquitous palms, but in the afternoon the       village was carried.         Kurna was now isolated, but its capture presented great       difficulties. All through the 8th General Fry bombarded it       from Mazera, while his infantry were slowly ferried over       higher up. This was prepared by some daring sappers, who       swam the broad river and fixed a wire rope by which the       boats were worked backward and forward, and an advance was       made against Kurna from the rear.         Subr Bey had lost very heavily at Mazera, so he accepted the       inevitable and surrendered. So a brilliant little episode       came to a victorious conclusion. Subr Bey was returned his       sword and complimented on his stubborn defense.         The capture of Kurna secured the possession of the Basra       region. Since then operations have been directed to securing       it against Turkish attempts at recovery.    [Illustration: German Colonial Possessions in the Pacific]    A recent stage of this campaign is thus described in The Pioneer Mail  (Allahabad) June 4, 1915:         It is announced from Simla that on the morning of May 31 a       further advance up the Tigris River was made by the British       expeditionary force in close co-operation with the navy.       Notwithstanding the excessive heat the troops advanced with       great dash and determination, and successively captured four       positions held by the enemy. As far as reported we suffered       only a few casualties. Valuable work was performed by our       aeroplanes. The operations are proceeding.    The British force at the end of June had reached Shaiba.      VI. THE \"UNREST\" IN INDIA.    The splendid work done by Indian regulars and Indian imperial forces  (the forces supplied by native Princes) in Europe, in Africa, in  Egypt, in Mesopotamia is a sufficient answer to the suggestion that  British influence in India has been weakened by the war. The  enthusiastic formation of volunteer corps, both of Europeans and of  natives, is a further proof that the peoples of India, now more than  ever, realize the benefits of liberty and security which they enjoy.  In India the torpedoing of the Lusitania made a profound impression,  as the native press proves.    A notable trial, the Lahore conspiracy case, disclosed the curious  fact that almost the only case of \"unrest\" in India was \"made in  America\" by returned emigrants from Canada and California, who, on  their way back, were interviewed by the German Consuls at Chinese  ports and advised to stir up an insurrection. This they tried to do,  using bombs made of brass inkpots, and bombarding the houses of  well-to-do natives, seeking in this way to raise money to finance the  rising.    The Pioneer Mail (Allahabad) gives an interesting account of the trial  of these peculiar patriots, half of whom seem to have informed on the  other half. It appears that they, or others like them, were  instrumental in causing the recent riot at Singapore, in which some  twenty European men and women were killed.      VII. GERMAN"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22483"],[0,"Across Unknown South America (#18)"],[1,"    On leaving S. Antonio the trail ascended to a height of 3,100 ft. (41/2  kil. from the village), and we were then in a rich forest region, where  the _acaju_--of the _Terebinthaceae_ family--was plentiful, with its huge  leaves and contorted branches. The acaju produced a refreshing fruit,  either of a bright red or else of a yellow colour, not unlike a large  pepper, outside of which was strongly attached a seed possessing highly  caustic qualities. Many _gordinha_ trees were also to be seen. It was  interesting to see how those zones of forest were suddenly succeeded by  beautiful and vast areas of grazing land, such as we found that day. We  crossed three streams at the respective elevations of 2,550 ft., 2,650  ft., and 2,750 ft., after which we reached an elevation of 3,000 ft., the  highest we had so far attained on our route from the coast, where we  found ourselves on a grassy tableland of considerable beauty. Looking  back to the S.S.E., we perceived the two hill ranges, one behind the  other, which we had crossed. Between them and us were marvellous slopes  covered with green grass, but not in the lower portion, where bordering  the stream was luxuriant forest. This was noticeable also on a hill to  the west, forming a minor tableland with rounded sides.    To the N.N.E. was a perfectly flat plateau. The distance rendered it of a  deep blue, and its level sky-line gave the appearance of the horizon upon  the ocean, except that there rose two small peaks which stood up slightly  above the elevation of the plateau. On all that beautiful land only two  small miserable farms were to be seen. Yet it seemed to be a paradise on  earth--delightful climate, excellent soil, useful woods in the forest,  plenty of delicious water.    Three more streamlets flowing from west to east were encountered at  elevations of 2,700 ft., 2,750 ft. and 2,800 ft., with undulating grassy  land between of wonderful beauty.    Having deviated somewhat from our route, we at last descended into a  grassy valley--absolutely flat--the best of all we had seen. It had been  fenced all round. Upon inquiry, I learned that it had been acquired by  the Redemptionist Friars. There is one thing friars certainly know. It  is how to select the best land anywhere to settle upon.    We had travelled 46 kil. 200 m. that day when we arrived at Campinas  (elev. 2,550 ft. above the sea level)--the usual kind of filthy village  with tiny, one-storied houses, more like toys than real liveable  habitations. This time the doors and windows were bordered with grey  instead of blue. On nearing those villages in Central Brazil one  frequently found an abundance of rough wooden crosses scattered upon the  landscape. They marked the spots where individuals had been killed.    In the room where I put up in the village, in the _hospedagem_, or  rest-house, the floor was besmeared with blood, the result of a recent  murder. The shops grew more and more uninteresting as we got farther into  the interior. The difficulties of transport were naturally greater, the  prices rose by leaps and bounds, as we got farther; the population got  poorer and poorer for lack of enterprise. The articles of luxury and  vanity, so frequently seen in shops before, were now altogether absent,  and only bottles of inferior liquor and beer were sold, matches and  candles--that was all. No trade, no industry, no money, existed in those  places. If one happened to pay with a five- or a ten-milreis note (6_s._  8_d._ or 13_s._ 4_d._), one could never obtain change. Frequently, unless  you wished to leave the change behind, you were obliged to carry away the  balance in cheap stearine or beer. I took the stearine. A short distance  from the town was a seminary, with four German friars, very fat, very  jolly, very industrious.    Alcides, one of my men, was by way of being a veterinary surgeon. Here is  how he cured a wounded mule, which, having received a powerful kick from  another animal, displayed a gash 3 in. long in her back, and so deep that  the entire hand could be inserted and actually disappear into the wound.  Francisco, another of my men, having duly and firmly tied the animal's  legs--a sensible precaution--proceeded with his naked arm to search for  _bishus_: anything living is a _bishu_ in Brazil, from an elephant to a  flea; but in this particular case it was applied to insects, such as  _carrapatos_, maggots, or parasites, which might have entered the wound.  Having done this at considerable length and care, he proceeded to tear  off with his nails the sore edges of the laceration, after which he  inserted into the gash a pad of cotton-wool soaked in creoline. That was  the treatment for the first day. The second day, the wound proceeding  satisfactorily, he inserted into it, together with his hand, a whole  lemon in which he had made a cut, and squeezed its juice within the raw  flesh. The amazing part of it all was that the animal, with an additional  bath or two of salt and water, absolutely recovered from the wound and  got perfectly well.    The Redemptionist monks had a fine vineyard adjoining their  monastery--the only one of any size and importance we had seen since  leaving the railway--and also some lovely orange groves in a walled  enclosure. They had built a mill on the bank of the stream. Most of that  beautiful valley for miles and miles belonged to them. The town of  Campinas--not to be confounded with Campinas of Sao Paulo Province--had a  population of 600 souls.    When we left that place the next morning, again we went across beautiful  flat stretches of grassy land--several miles long and broad--regular  tablelands, at an elevation of 2,700 ft.--most wonderful pasture lands  now going absolutely to waste. Plentiful streamlets intersected those  lovely meadows at a slightly lower elevation--merely a few feet--where  the water had eroded itself a channel. Those streams were generally  bordered by a thick growth of trees and entangled vegetation. We stopped  for lunch at the farm of _Boa Vista_ (Belvedere or Fine View), so  called--according to the usual Brazilian way of reasoning--because it was  situated in a deep hollow from which you could see nothing at all!  Another more rational name which this place also possessed was Bocca do  Matto (Mouth of the Forest), because it truly was at the entrance of a  thick forest extending to the north.    We went, in fact, from that point through densely wooded country,  although the trees were of no great height or size. The ground was swampy  and sloppy, most unpleasant for marching, for some nineteen kilometres,  until we arrived at Goyabeira (elev. 2,700 ft.), having covered 56 kil.  100 m. that day--not at all bad marching considering that we could not  change animals and we conveyed all our baggage along with us.    I saw that day another snake, called by the natives _duas cabecas_ (and  Tu Nou), or double-headed snake, because its marking gives that  impression at first sight.    After leaving Goyabeira the thick growth continued over several ridges,  the highest of which was 2,950 ft., with streams between at elevations  respectively of 2,630 and 2,700 ft. I noticed in the forest some  beautiful paneira trees, with their trunks enlarged near the base--a  regular swelling all round. One of the peculiarities of this tree was  that it produced a kind of vegetable wool contained within fairly hard  capsules.    That was indeed a day of surprises for us. As we were proceeding over  another hill range between two streams (elev. 2,850 ft.), we saw at last  some butterflies of a gorgeous lemon yellow, some of a rich orange,  others of red and black, great numbers of pure white, and some huge ones  of an indescribably beautiful metallic blue colour. There were swarms of  them near the water. So unaccustomed were they to see human beings that  many settled on my white coat and on my straw hat and came along  undisturbed for long distances upon my person. They were so beautiful  that I had not the desire to kill them, even for the sake of bringing  back a valuable collection. It would have been easy to capture them, as  you could touch them several times with your fingers before they would  fly away. One butterfly particularly took a great fancy to my left hand,  in which I held the reins of my mule, and on which it sat during our  marches for several days--much to my inconvenience, for I was afraid of  injuring it. It would occasionally fly away and then return. At night  while we were camping I transferred it to my straw hat, on which it  quietly remained until the next morning. The moment I had mounted my  mule, the butterfly would at once fly again to my hand. This great  affection was due chiefly, I believe, not to any magnetic attraction, but  merely to the delicately scented soap which I used in my morning bath,  and which greatly attracted the butterfly.    On many occasions on that expedition I had similar experiences with  butterflies.    For the first time, too, I perceived that day a few _colibris_--tiny  humming-birds of wonderful plumage.    Twenty-three kilometres from Goyabeira--after many ups and downs along a  deep-channelled, slushy trail, and having crossed over several swampy,  troublesome streamlets--we suddenly emerged into a marvellous undulating  open plain with lovely grass and numerous fat cattle grazing upon it. In  the distance upon the hill-side four or five farm-sheds could be  perceived. We had stopped at one farm on the way in hopes of getting  food, but they could only sell us some _feijao_--beans soaked in lard--so  that it was with some haste that we directed our mules to the more  imposing building in expectation of finding there at least some rice and  eggs. We hurriedly crossed the plain and then the stream, and halted at  the Cachoeira Grande (Grand Rapid) farm, 2,950 ft. above the sea level. A  pure negro was in charge of the place, whose wife was also as black as  the"]]]
