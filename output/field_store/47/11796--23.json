They form, as it were, reservoirs of caloric,  the influence of which is exceedingly grateful during a cold night.    In the polar regions the Esquimaux live and make themselves comfortable  in huts of ice or snow, and with no other combustible but oil.    The natives of Australia bury their bodies in the sand, keeping their  heads only above the surface, and thus sleep warm during the chilly  nights of that climate.    Fortunately for the health and comfort of travelers upon the Plains,  the atmosphere is pure and dry during the greater part of the year, and  it is seldom that any rain or dew is seen; neither are there marshes or  ponds of stagnant water to generate putrid exhalations and poisonous  malaria. The night air of the summer months is soft, exhilarating, and  delightful. Persons may therefore sleep in it and inhale it with  perfect impunity, and, indeed, many prefer this to breathing the  confined atmosphere of a house or tent.    During the rainy season only is it necessary to seek shelter. In  traveling with covered wagons one always has protection from storms,  but with pack trains it becomes necessary to improvise the best  substitutes for tents.    A very secure protection against storms may be constructed by planting  firmly in the ground two upright poles, with forks at their tops, and  crossing them with a light pole laid in the forks. A gutta-percha  cloth, or sheet of canvas, or, in the absence of either of these two,  blankets, may be attached by one side to the horizontal pole, the  opposite edge being stretched out to the windward at an angle of about  forty-five degrees to the ground, and there fastened with wooden pins,  or with buckskin strings tied to the lower border of the cloth and to  pegs driven firmly into the earth. This forms a shelter for three or  four men, and is a good defense against winds and rains. If a fire be  then made in front, the smoke will be carried away, so as not to  incommode the occupants of the bivouac.    This is called a \"half-faced\" camp.    [Illustration: HALF-FACED CAMP.]    Another method practiced a great deal among mountain men and Indians  consists in placing several rough poles equidistant around in a half  circle, and bringing the small ends together at the top, where they are  bound with a thong. This forms the conical frame-work of the bivouac,  which, when covered with a cloth stretched around it, makes a very good  shelter, and is preferable to the half-faced camp, because the sides  are covered.    [Illustration: CONICAL BIVOUAC.]    When no cloths, blankets, or hides are at hand to be placed over the  poles of the lodge, it may be covered with green boughs laid on  compactly, so as to shed a good deal of rain, and keep out the wind in  cold weather. We adopted this description of shelter in crossing the  Rocky Mountains during the winter of 1857-8, and thus formed a very  effectual protection against the bleak winds which sweep with great  violence over those lofty and inhospitable _sierras_. We always  selected a dense thicket for our encampment, and covered the lodges  with a heavy coating of pine boughs, wattling them together as  compactly as possible, and piling snow upon the outside in such a  manner as to make them quite impervious to the wind. The fires were  then kindled at the mouths of the lodges, and our heads and bodies were  completely sheltered, while our feet were kept warm by the fires.    The French troops, while serving in the Crimea, used what they call the  _tente d'abri_, or shelter tent, which seems to have been received with  great favor in Europe. It is composed of two, four, or six square  pieces of cloth, with buttons and buttonholes adjusted upon the edges,  and is pitched by planting two upright stakes in the ground at a  distance corresponding with the length of the canvas when buttoned  together. The two sticks are connected by a cord passed around the top  of each, drawn tight, and the ends made fast to pins driven firmly into  the ground. The canvas is then laid over the rope between the sticks,  spread out at an angle of about forty-five degrees, and the lower edges  secured to the earth with wooden pins. This makes some defense against  the weather, and was the only shelter enjoyed by the mass of the French  army in the Crimea up to October, 1855. For a permanent camp it is  usual to excavate a shallow basement under the tent, and to bank up the  earth on the outside in cold weather. It is designed that upon marches  the _tente d'abri_ shall be taken to pieces and carried by the  soldiers.    A tent has recently been prepared by Mr. John Rider, 165 Broadway, New  York, which is called the \"_tent knapsack_.\" It has been examined by a  board of army officers, and recommended for adoption in our military  service.    [Illustration: TENT KNAPSACK.]    This tent is somewhat similar to the _tente d'abri_, and is pitched in  the same manner, but it has this advantage, that each separate piece  may be converted into a water-proof knapsack.    The following extracts from the Report of the Board go to show that  this tent knapsack will be useful to parties traveling on the prairies  with pack trains:    \"It is a piece of gutta-percha 5 feet 3 inches long, and 3 feet 8  inches wide, with double edges on one side, and brass studs and  button-holes along two edges, and straps and buckles on the fourth  edge; the whole weighing three pounds; two sticks, 3 feet 8 inches long  by 1-1/4 inches in diameter, and a small cord. When used as a knapsack,  the clothing is packed in a cotton bag, and the gutta-percha sheet is  folded round it, lapping at the ends. The clothing is thus protected by  two or three thicknesses of gutta-percha, and in this respect there is  a superiority over the knapsack now used by our troops. Other  advantages are, that the tent knapsack has no seams, the parts at which  those in use wear out soonest; it adapts itself to the size of the  contents, so that a compact and portable bundle can be made, whether  the kit be entire or not; and, with the cotton bag, it forms a  convenient, commodious, and durable receptacle for all a soldier's  clothing and necessaries.    \"On a scout a soldier usually carries only a blanket, overcoat, and at  most a single shirt, pair of drawers, and a pair of socks, all of which  can be packed in the tent knapsack in a small bundle, perfectly  protected from rain, and capable of being suspended from the shoulders  and carried with comfort and ease during a march.    \"2d. As a shelter. The studs and eyelets along two edges of the tent  knapsack are for the purpose of fastening a number of them together,  and thus making a sheet of larger dimensions.    \"A sheet formed by fastening together four knapsacks was exhibited to  the Board, stretched upon a frame of wood. When used in service the  sheet is to be stretched on a rope supported by two poles, or by two  rifles, muskets, or carbines, and pinned down at the sides with six  pins, three on each side.    \"The sheet of four knapsacks is 10 feet 6 inches long, and 7 feet 4  inches wide, and when pitched on a rope 4 feet 4 inches above the  ground, covers a horizontal space 6 feet 6 inches wide, and 7 feet 4  inches long, which will accommodate five men, and may be made to  shelter seven. The sheet can also be used on the ground, and is a great  protection from dampness, and as a shawl or talma; indeed, a variety of  advantageous uses to which the gutta-percha sheet may be put will  suggest themselves to persons using it.    \"The Board is satisfied with its merits in all the uses to which it is  proposed to be put, and is of opinion that the gutta-percha tent  knapsack may be adopted in the military service with advantage.\"                         *      *      *      *      *    The usual tenement of the prairie tribes, and of the traders, trappers,  and hunters who live among them, is the Comanche lodge, which is made  of eight straight peeled poles about twenty feet long, covered with  hides or cloth. The lodge is pitched by connecting the smaller  extremities of three of the poles with one end of a long line. The  three poles are then raised perpendicularly, and the larger extremities  spread out in a tripod to the circumference of the circle that is to  form the base of the lodge. The other poles are then raised, laid into  the forks of the three first, and spread out equidistant upon the  circle, thus forming the conical framework of the structure. Nine or  ten poles are generally used in one lodge.    [Illustration: COMANCHE LODGE.]    The long line attached to the tripod is then wound several times around  the top, where the poles intersect, and the lower end made fast at the  base of the lodge, thus securing the frame firmly in its position. The  covering, made of buffalo hides, dressed without the hair, and cut and  sewed together to fit the conical frame, is raised with a pole, spread  out around the structure, and united at the edges with sharpened wooden  pegs, leaving sufficient space open at the bottom for a doorway, which  may be closed with a blanket spread out with two small sticks, and  suspended over the opening.    The lower edge of the lodge is made fast to the ground with wooden  pins. The apex is left open, with a triangular wing or flap on each  side, and the windward flap constantly stretched out by means of a pole  inserted into a pocket in the end of it, which causes it to draw like a  sail, and thus occasions a draught from the fire built upon the ground  in the centre of the lodge, and makes it warm and comfortable in the  coldest winter weather. Canvas makes a very good substitute for the  buffalo-skin covering.      SIBLEY TENT.    A tent has been invented by Major H. H. Sibley, of the army, which is  known as the \"_Sibley tent_.\" It is somewhat similar to the Comanche  lodge, but in place of the conical "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23186"],[0,"The Handbook to English Heraldry (#18)"],[1," and, in some cases, they take a part in the blazonry of  Shields, or they are borne independently as Badges. A very brief  description (all that is necessary) of the greater number of these  monsters of _un_natural history will be given in the \"Glossary of  heraldic terms,\" in Chapter X.; consequently, it is enough here merely  to refer to them as having a place in blazon. The Griffin or Gryphon,  the most worthy of the group, is comparatively common. The Dragon and  the Wivern or Wyvern, both of them winged monsters, differ in this  respect, that the former has four legs, while the latter has two only.  In early blazon this distinction was not always observed. The  Cockatrice, always having two legs, is a Wyvern with a cock's head.    Natural Objects of all kinds are blazoned as Charges of Heraldry, and  they will be found described and illustrated in their proper places in  Chapter X. They include the _Sun_, the _Moon_, the _Stars_; also such  terrestrial objects as _Trees_, _Flowers_, _Fruits_, _Sheaves and Ears  of Corn_, _Leaves_, _Chaplets_, _&c._ And with these Charges I may group  the always beautiful Fleur de Lys, and the Trefoil, Quatrefoil,  Cinquefoil, and Sixfoil.    Of the various Artificial Figures and Devices that Heralds have charged  upon Shields of Arms, it will be unnecessary for me to give detailed  descriptions, except when either the heraldic name may require  explanation, or some special circumstances connected with any particular  figure or device may impart to it peculiar claims for attention. Again I  refer to the \"Glossary\" for notices and examples of all Charges of this  class--Annulets, Buckles, Castles, Crowns, Cups, Horseshoes, Keys,  Knots, Sickles, Stirrups, Trumpets, and many others.      [Illustration: No. 166A.--Crescent]      [Illustration: No. 166B.--Increscent]      [Illustration: No. 166C.--Decrescent]    In blazoning Charges of various classes, Heralds employ _appropriate  Epithets and descriptive Terms_, of which the following are  characteristic examples:--The _Sun_ is \"_in splendour_.\" The _Moon_,  when full, is \"_in her complement_\": she is a \"_Crescent_\" when she  appears in No. 166, A: she is \"_Increscent_\" when as in No. 166, B: and  she is \"_Decrescent_\" when as in No. 166, C. Animals and Birds of prey  are said to be \"_armed_\" of their talons, teeth, and claws. All horned  animals, also, except Stags and Antelopes, are \"_armed_\" of their horns;  and a Cock is \"_armed_\" of his spurs; whilst Griffins and birds of prey  are \"_armed_\" of their beaks and claws (_i.e._ the part of the leg which  is unfeathered). Animals are \"_hoofed_\" or \"_unguled_\" of their hoofs;  and \"_langued_\" of their tongues. Fierce animals are \"_vorant_\" of their  prey, when represented in the act of devouring it. Deer, when reposing,  are \"_lodged_\" Nos. 25 and 26: when standing, and looking out from the  Shield, No. 167, \"_at gaze_\": when in easy motion, they are termed  \"_trippant_,\" or sometimes the word \"_tripping_\" is substituted, No.  168: and when in rapid motion, they are \"_courant_,\" \"_at speed_,\" or  sometimes described as \"_in full course_,\" No. 169. The male Stag is  sometimes termed a \"_Hart_,\" and the female a \"_Hind_.\" There is really  a distinction between the Buck and the Stag, but it is very usually  disregarded in Heraldry. The antlers of the Hart are \"_Attires_,\" their  branches are \"_Tynes_\"; and they are said to be \"_attired_\" of their  antlers. A Stag's head full-faced, but without the neck, as No. 170, is  \"_cabossed_\" or \"_caboshed_.\"      [Illustration: No. 167.--At Gaze.]      [Illustration: No. 169.--At Speed.]      [Illustration: No. 168.--Tripping.]      [Illustration: No. 170.--Stag's Head Cabossed.]    Eagles and Hawks with expanded wings, as in No. 206, are \"_displayed_.\"  Expanded wings may be \"_elevated_,\" or, if drooping, \"_inverted_\" or  \"_in lure_.\" Birds about to take wing are \"_rising_\"; when in flight,  they are \"_volant_\"; when at rest, they are \"_close_.\" A Bird  \"_trusses_\" its prey. A Peacock having its tail expanded is \"_in its  pride_\"; and this same expression is applied to the Turkey. A Pelican,  when feeding its young, is said to be \"_in her piety_,\" but may be  merely \"_vulning herself_\" if the young are not represented. A Swan,  when blazoned \"_proper_,\" is white with red legs and black beak.    Fish, represented swimming in fesse, are \"_naiant_\"; if they are in  pale, they are \"_hauriant_,\" No. 164; but if their heads are to the  base, the term \"_urinant_\" is said to apply, but I cannot say I have so  far come across an authenticated instance of the use of this word; if  their bodies are bent, as the Dolphin is generally represented, they are  \"_embowed_,\" No. 163. Fish, also, are said to be \"_finned_\" of their  fins. Insects are \"_volant_.\" Reptiles are \"_gliding_\"; or, if they are  twined into knots, \"_nowed_.\" Trees of mature growth are \"_accrued_\";  when with leaves, \"_in foliage_\" (but these two terms are so seldom used  that they may be entirely disregarded); with fruit or seeds, \"_fructed_\"  or \"_seeded_\"; if without leaves, \"_blasted_\"; and if their roots are  exposed, \"_eradicated_.\" Branches or leaves torn off are \"_slipped_.\"    The terms which denote the attitudes of Lions, all of them described in  the next chapter, are equally applicable to other animals. Some other  descriptive terms, not noticed here, will be found in the \"Glossary\" in  Chapter X.          CHAPTER IX    THE GRAMMAR OF HERALDRY    SECTION VI      _The Lion and the Eagle in Heraldry_      \"The LION and a King of Beasts.\"      --SHAKESPEARE, _Richard II._      \"The EAGLE, ennobled by Nature in as high a degree of nobility as    the chiefest of the terrestrial animals, is the most honourable    bearing of Birds.\"      --GWILLIM (_Edition of 1724_).      The regal dignity of the LION amongst the creatures that are quadrupeds,  like himself, would naturally secure for him a position of corresponding  eminence in Heraldry. From the dawn of the heraldic era, accordingly,  the Lion is blazoned on the Shields of Sovereigns, Princes, and Nobles.  The tressured Lion has been already noticed upon the Royal Shield of  SCOTLAND, No. 138; and a crowned Lion has also appeared in the same  attitude, borne by an English Prince, RICHARD, Earl of CORNWALL, No.  140. From the time that they first possessed any true armorial insignia,  the Sovereigns of the Realm of ENGLAND have borne Lions upon their Royal  Shield. A Lion was the Ensign of the Native Princes of WALES, as he was  of the Kings of LEON, of NORWAY, and of DENMARK, and of the Counts of  HOLLAND, HAINAULT, EU, &c. And, in like manner, the Lion was in high  favour with the most noble and powerful Barons of England--the MOWBRAYS,  BOHUNS, LONGESPEES, FITZ-ALANS, LACIES, PERCIES, SEGRAVES, and such as  they.    It was a necessary consequence of his great popularity that the Lion of  Heraldry should be blazoned in various attitudes, and also variously  tinctured, otherwise it would not be possible duly to distinguish the  Lions of different Shields. Heralds of all countries appear readily to  have permitted their Lions to lay aside their natural tawny hue, and in  its stead to assume the heraldic _or_, _argent_, _azure_, _gules_, and  _sable_; but Continental Heralds were not generally disposed to  recognise in their Lions any other attitude than the one which they held  to be consistent with their Lion character, instincts, and  habits--erect, that is, with one hind paw only on the ground, looking  forward towards their prey, so as to show but one eye, and evidently in  the act of preparing to spring. This undoubtedly most characteristic  attitude is _rampant_, No. 171: and only when he was in this rampant  attitude did the early Heralds consider any Lion to be a Lion, and  blazon him by his true name. A Lion walking and looking about him, the  early Heralds held to be acting the part of a leopard: consequently,  when he was in any such attitude, they blazoned him as \"_a leopard_.\"  The animal bearing that name bore it simply as an heraldic title, which  distinguished a Lion in a particular attitude. These heraldic \"leopards\"  were drawn in every respect as other heraldic \"lions,\" without spots or  any leopard_ish_ distinction whatever. This explains the usage, retained  till late in the fourteenth century, which assigned to the Lions of the  Royal Shield of England the name of \"leopards.\" They were so called, not  by the enemies of England for derision and insult, as some persons, in  their ignorance of early Heraldry, have been pleased both to imagine and  to assert; but the English Kings and Princes, who well knew their  \"Lions\" to be Lions, in blazon styled them \"leopards,\" because they also  knew that Lions in the attitude of their \"Lions\" were heraldic  \"leopards.\" When at length the necessity of varying the attitude of  their Lions was admitted by all Heralds, in consequence of the greatly  increased numbers of the bearers of Lions, some strict adherents to the  original distinctive nomenclature blazoned any Lion that was _not  rampant_ by the compound term of a \"_lion-leopard_,\" or a  \"_lion-leopardé_.\" But that controversy has long been at rest.    The following terms are now in use to denote the various attitudes of  the Lion in Heraldry:--    _Rampant_: erect, one hind paw on the ground, the other three paws  elevated, the animal looking forward and having his tail elevated, No.  171. _Rampant Guardant_: as before, but looking out from the Shield, No.  172. _Rampant Reguardant_: as before, but looking backwards.    _Passant_: walking, three paws on the ground, the dexter fore-paw being  elevated, looking forward, the tail displayed over the back, No. 173.  _Passant Guardant_: as before, but looking out from the Shield, No. 174.  _Passant Reguardant_: as before, but looking backwards.
