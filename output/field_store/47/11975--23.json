This was not like the Ball, in which the lights were  electronically placed, automatically controlled, clear, sharp, and  steady. This was radar. A radar considerably different from that of  1948, of course, and greatly improved, but still pitifully inadequate in  dealing with objects separated by hundreds of miles and traveling at  velocities of thousands of miles per hour!    Nor was this like the practice cruises, in which the targets had been  harmless barrels or equally harmless dirigible rockets. This was the  real thing; the targets today would be lethal objects indeed. Practice  gunnery, with only a place in the Proficiency List at stake, had been  exciting enough: this was too exciting--_much_ too exciting--for the  keenness of brain and the quickness and steadiness of eye and of hand so  soon to be required.    A target? Or was it? Yes--three or four of them!    \"Target One--Zone Ten,\" a quiet voice spoke into Kinnison's ear and one  of the white specks upon his plate turned yellowish green. The same  words, the same lights, were heard and seen by the eleven other Technos  of Sector A, of which Kinnison, by virtue of standing at the top of his  Combat Rocket's Proficiency List, was Sector Chief. He knew that the  voice was that of Sector A's Fire Control Officer, whose duty it was to  determine, from courses, velocities, and all other data to be had from  ground and lofty observers, the order in which his Sector's targets  should be eliminated. And Sector A, an imaginary but sharply-defined  cone, was in normal maneuvering the hottest part of the sky. Fire  Control's \"Zone Ten\" had informed him that the object was at extreme  range and hence there would be plenty of time. Nevertheless:    \"Lawrence--two! Doyle--one! Drummond--stand by with three!\" he snapped,  at the first word.    In the instant of hearing his name each Techno stabbed down a series of  studs and there flowed into his ears a rapid stream of figures--the  up-to-the-second data from every point of observation as to every  element of motion of his target. He punched the figures into his  calculator, which would correct automatically for the motion of his own  vessel--glanced once at the printed solution of the problem--tramped  down upon a pedal once, twice, or three times, depending upon the  number of projectiles he had been directed to handle.    Kinnison had ordered Lawrence, a better shot than Doyle, to launch two  torpedoes; neither of which, at such long range, was expected to strike  its mark. His second, however, should come close; so close that the  instantaneous data sent back to both screens--and to Kinnison's--by the  torpedo itself would make the target a sitting duck for Doyle, the less  proficient follower.    Drummond, Kinnison's Number Three, would not launch his missiles unless  Doyle missed. Nor could both Drummond and Harper, Kinnison's Number Two,  be \"out\" at once. One of the two had to be \"in\" at all times, to take  Kinnison's place in charge of the Sector if the Chief were ordered out.  For while Kinnison could order either Harper or Drummond on target, he  could not send himself. He could go out only when ordered to do so by  Fire Control: Sector Chiefs were reserved for emergency use only.    \"Target Two--Zone Nine,\" Fire Control said.    \"Carney, two. French, one. Day, stand by with three!\" Kinnison ordered.    \"Damn it--missed!\" This from Doyle. \"Buck fever--no end.\"    \"O.K., boy--that's why we're starting so soon. I'm shaking like a  vibrator myself. We'll get over it....\"    The point of light which represented Target One bulged slightly and went  out. Drummond had connected and was back \"in\".    \"Target Three--Zone Eight. Four--eight,\" Fire Control remarked.    \"Target Three--Higgins and Green; Harper stand by. Four--Case and  Santos: Lawrence.\"    After a minute or two of actual combat the Technos of Sector A began to  steady down. Stand-by men were no longer required and were no longer  assigned.    \"Target Forty-one--six,\" said Fire Control; and:    \"Lawrence, two. Doyle, two,\" ordered Kinnison. This was routine enough,  but in a moment:    \"Ted!\" Lawrence snapped. \"Missed--wide--both barrels. Forty-one's  dodging--manned or directed--coming like hell--watch it, Doyle--WATCH  IT!\"    \"Kinnison, take it!\" Fire Control barked, voice now neither low nor  steady, and without waiting to see whether Doyle would hit or miss.  \"It's in Zone Three already--collision course!\"    \"Harper! Take over!\"    Kinnison got the data, solved the equations, launched five torpedoes at  fifty gravities of acceleration. One ... two--three-four-five; the last  three as close together as they could fly without setting off their  proximity fuzes.    Communications and mathematics and the electronic brains of calculating  machines had done all that they could do; the rest was up to human  skill, to the perfection of co-ordination and the speed of reaction of  human mind, nerve, and muscle.    Kinnison's glance darted from plate to panel to computer-tape to meter  to galvanometer and back to plate; his left hand moved in tiny arcs the  knobs whose rotation varied the intensities of two mutually  perpendicular components of his torpedoes' drives. He listened  attentively to the reports of triangulating observers, now giving him  data covering his own missiles, as well as the target object. The  fingers of his right hand punched almost constantly the keys of his  computer; he corrected almost constantly his torpedoes' course.    \"Up a hair,\" he decided. \"Left about a point.\"    The target moved away from its predicted path.    Down two--left three--down a hair--_Right_! The thing was almost through  Zone Two; was blasting into Zone One.    He thought for a second that his first torp was going to connect. It  almost did--only a last-instant, full-powered side thrust enabled the  target to evade it. Two numbers flashed white upon his plate; his actual  error, exact to the foot of distance and to the degree on the clock,  measured and transmitted back to his board by instruments in his  torpedo.    Working with instantaneous and exact data, and because the enemy had so  little time in which to act, Kinnison's second projectile made a very  near miss indeed. His third was a graze; so close that its proximity  fuze functioned, detonating the cyclonite-packed war-head. Kinnison knew  that his third went off, because the error-figures vanished, almost in  the instant of their coming into being, as its detecting and  transmitting instruments were destroyed. That one detonation might have  been enough; but Kinnison had had one glimpse of his error--how small it  was!--and had a fraction of a second of time. Hence Four and Five  slammed home; dead center. Whatever that target had been, it was no  longer a threat.    \"Kinnison, in,\" he reported briefly to Fire Control, and took over from  Harper the direction of the activities of Sector A.    The battle went on. Kinnison sent Harper and Drummond out time after  time. He himself was given three more targets. The first wave of the  enemy--what was left of it--passed. Sector A went into action, again at  extreme range, upon the second. Its remains, too, plunged downward and  onward toward the distant ground.    The third wave was really tough. Not that it was actually any worse than  the first two had been, but the CR10685 was no longer getting the data  which her Technos ought to have to do a good job; and every man aboard  her knew why. Some enemy stuff had got through, of course; and the  observatories, both on the ground and above it--the eye of the whole  American Defense--had suffered heavily.    Nevertheless, Kinnison and his fellows were not too perturbed. Such a  condition was not entirely unexpected. They were now veterans; they had  been tried and had not been found wanting. They had come unscathed  through a bath of fire the like of which the world had never before  known. Give them any kind of computation at all--or no computation at  all except old CR10685's own radar and their own torps, of which they  still had plenty--and they could and would take care of anything that  could be thrown at them.    The third wave passed. Targets became fewer and fewer. Action slowed  down ... stopped.    The Technos, even the Sector Chiefs, knew nothing whatever of the  progress of the battle as a whole. They did not know where their rocket  was, or whether it was going north, east, south, or west. They knew when  it was going up or down only by the \"seats of their pants.\" They did not  even know the nature of the targets they destroyed, since upon their  plates all targets looked alike--small, bright, greenish-yellow spots.  Hence:    \"Give us the dope, Pete, if we've got a minute to spare,\" Kinnison  begged of his Fire Control Officer. \"You know more than we do--give!\"    \"It's coming in now,\" came the prompt reply. \"Six of those targets that  did such fancy dodging were atomics, aimed at the Lines. Five were  dirigibles, with our number on 'em. You fellows did a swell job. Very  little of their stuff got through--not enough, they say, to do much  damage to a country as big as the U.S.A. On the other hand, they stopped  scarcely any of ours--they apparently didn't have anything to compare  with you Technos.    \"But all hell seems to be busting loose, all over the world. Our east  and west coasts are both being attacked, they say; but are holding.  Operation Daisy and Operation Fairfield are clicking, just like we did.  Europe, they say, is going to hell--everybody is taking pot-shots at  everybody else. One report says that the South American nations are  bombing each other ... Asia, too ... nothing definite; as straight dope  comes in I'll relay it to you.    \"We came through in very good shape, considering ... losses less than  anticipated, only seven percent.

The whole party left Kaze together;  but on arrival at Tura the slaves said they had not enough beads and  would return for some more, when they would follow my men. This bit  of news was the worst that could have befallen us; my men were  broken-hearted enough before, and this drove the last spark of spirit  out of them. To make the best of a bad job, I now sent Bombay with two  other men off to Musa to see what he could do, and ordered my other  men to hire Wakimbu from village to village. On the 7th, a nervous  excitement was produced in the camp by some of my men running in and  calling all to arm, as the fugitive chief Manua Sera was coming, with  thirty armed followers carrying muskets. Such was the case: and by the  time my men were all under arms, with their sword-bayonets fixed, drawn  up by my tent the veritable \"Tippler\" arrived; but, not liking the look  of such a formidable array as my men presented, he passed on a short  way, and then sent back a deputation to make known his desire of  calling on me, which was no sooner complied with than he came in person,  attended by a body-guard. On my requesting him to draw near and sit, his  wooden stool was placed for him. He began the conversation by telling  me he had heard of my distress from want of porters, and then offered  to assist me with some, provided I would take him to Kaze, and mediate  between him and the Arabs; for, through their unjustifiable interference  in his government affairs, a war had ensued, which terminated with the  Arabs driving him from his possessions a vagabond. Manua Sera, I  must say, was as fine a young man as ever I looked upon. He was very  handsome, and looked as I now saw him the very picture of a captain of  the banditti of the romances. I begged him to tell me his tale, and, in  compliance, he gave me the following narrative:--    \"Shortly after you left Kaze for England, my old father, the late chief  Fundi Kira, died, and by his desire I became lawful chief; for, though  the son of a slave girl, and not of Fundi Kira's wife, such is the  law of inheritance--a constitutional policy established to prevent any  chance of intrigues between the sons born in legitimate wedlock. Well,  after assuming the title of chief, I gave presents of ivory to all  the Arabs with a liberal hand, but most so to Musa, which caused great  jealousy amongst the other merchants. Then after this I established a  property tax on all merchandise that entered my country. Fundi Kira had  never done so, but I did not think that any reason why I should not,  especially as the Arabs were the only people who lived in my country  exempt from taxation. This measure, however, exasperated the Arabs, and  induced them to send me hostile messages, to the effect that, if I ever  meddled with them, they would dethrone me, and place Mkisiwa, another  illegitimate son, on the throne in my stead. This,\" Manua Sera  continued, \"I could not stand; the merchants were living on sufferance  only in my country. I told them so, and defied them to interfere with my  orders, for I was not a 'woman,' to be treated with contempt; and this  got up a quarrel. Mkisiwa, seizing at the opportunity of the prize held  out to him by the Arabs as his supporters, then commenced a system of  bribery. Words led to blows; we had a long and tough fight; I killed  many of their number, and they killed mine. Eventually they drove  me from my palace, and placed Mkisiwa there as chief in my stead. My  faithful followers however, never deserted me; so I went to Rubuga, and  put up with old Maula there. The Arabs followed--drove me to Nguru, and  tried to kill Maula for having fostered me. He, however, escaped them;  but they destroyed his country, and then followed me down to Nguru.  There we fought for many months, until all provisions were exhausted,  when I defied them to catch me, and forced my way through their ranks.  It is needless to say I have been a wanderer since; and though I wish to  make friends, they will not allow it, but do all they can to hunt me to  death. Now, as you were a friend of my father, I do hope you will patch  up this war for me, which you must think is unjust.\"    I told Manua Sera I felt very much for him, and I would do my best if  he would follow me to Kaze; but I knew that nothing could ever be done  unless he returned to the free-trade principles of his father. He then  said he had never taken a single tax from the Arabs, and would gladly  relinquish his intention to do so. The whole affair was commenced in too  great a hurry; but whatever happened he would gladly forgive all if I  would use my influence to reinstate him, for by no other means could he  ever get his crown back again. I then assured him that I would do what I  could to restore the ruined trade of his country, observing that, as all  the ivory that went out of his country, came to ours, and all imports  were productions of our country also, this war injured us as well as  himself. Manua Sera seemed highly delighted, and said he had a little  business to transact in Ugogo at present, but he would overtake me in a  few days. He then sent me one of my runaway porters, whom he had caught  in the woods making off with a load of my beads. We then separated; and  Baraka, by my orders, gave the thief fifty lashes for his double offence  of theft and desertion.    On the 9th, having bought two donkeys and engaged several men, we left  Jiwa la Mkoa, with half our traps, and marched to Garaeswi, where, to  my surprise, there were as many as twenty tembes--a recently-formed  settlement of Wokimbu. Here we halted a day for the rear convoy, and  then went on again by detachments to Zimbo, where, to our intense  delight, Bombay returned to us on the 13th, triumphantly firing guns,  with seventy slaves accompanying him, and with letters from Snay and  Musa, in which they said they hoped, if I met with Manua Sera, that  I would either put a bullet through his head, or else bring him in a  prisoner, that they might do for him, for the scoundrel had destroyed  all their trade by cutting off caravans. Their fights with him commenced  by his levying taxes in opposition to their treaties with his father,  Fundi Kira, and then preventing his subjects selling them grain.    Once more the whole caravan moved on; but as I had to pay each of the  seventy slaves sixteen yards of cloth, by order of their masters, in the  simple matter of expenditure it would have been better had I thrown ten  loads away at Ugogo, where my difficulties first commenced. On arrival  at Mgongo Thembo--the Elephant's Back--called so in consequence of a  large granitic rock, which resembles the back of that animal, protruding  through the ground--we found a clearance in the forest, of two miles  in extent, under cultivation. Here the first man to meet me was the  fugitive chief of Rubuga, Maula. This poor old man--one of the honestest  chiefs in the country--had been to the former expedition a host and good  friend. He now gave me a cow as a present, and said he would give me  ten more if I would assist him in making friends with the Arabs, who  had driven him out of his country, and had destroyed all his belongings,  even putting a slave to reign in his stead, though he had committed no  fault of intentional injury towards them. It was true Manua Sera, their  enemy, had taken refuge in his palace, but that was not his fault; for,  anticipating the difficulties that would arise, he did his best to keep  Manua Sera out of it, but Manua Sera being too strong for him, forced  his way in. I need not say I tried to console this unfortunate victim of  circumstances as best I could, inviting him to go with me to Kaze, and  promising to protect him with my life if he feared the Arabs; but the  old man, being too feeble to travel himself, said he would send his son  with me.    Next day we pushed on a double march through the forest, and reached  a nullah. As it crosses the track in a southerly direction, this might  either be the head of the Kululu mongo or river, which, passing through  the district of Kiwele, drains westward into the Malagarazi river, and  thence into the Tanganyika, or else the most westerly tributary to the  Ruaha river, draining eastward into the sea. The plateau, however,  is apparently so flat here, that nothing b a minute survey, or rather  following the watercourse, could determine the matter. Then emerging  from the wilderness, we came into the open cultivated district of Tura,  or \"put down\"--called so by the natives because it was, only a few years  ago, the first cleared space in the wilderness, and served as a good  halting-station, after the normal ten day's march in the jungles, where  we had now been struggling more than a month.    The whole place, once so fertile, was now almost depopulated and in a  sad state of ruin, showing plainly the savage ravages of war; for the  Arabs and their slaves, when they take the field, think more of plunder  and slavery than the object they started on--each man of the force  looking out for himself. The incentives, too, are so great;--a young  woman might be caught (the greatest treasure of earth), or a boy or  a girl, a cow or a goat--all of the fortunes, of themselves too  irresistible to be overlooked when the future is doubtful. Here Sheikh  Said broke down in health of a complaint which he formerly had suffered  from, and from which I at once saw he would never recover sufficiently  well to be ever effective again. It was a sad misfortune, as the men  had great confidence in him, being the representative of their Zanzibar  government:"]]]
