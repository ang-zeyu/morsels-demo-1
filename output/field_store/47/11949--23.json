Day, the author of _Sandford and Merton_, was an eccentric but amiable  man; he retired into the country \"to exclude himself,\" as he said, \"from  the vanity, vice, and deceptive character of man,\" but he appears to  have been strangely jilted by women. When about the age of twenty-one,  and after his suit had been rejected by a young lady to whom he had paid  his addresses, Mr. Day formed the singular project of educating a wife  for himself. This was based upon the notion of Rousseau, that \"all the  genuine worth of the human species is perverted by society; and that  children should be educated apart from the world, in order that their  minds should be kept untainted with, and ignorant of, its vices,  prejudices, and artificial manners.\"    Day set about his project by selecting two girls from an establishment  at Shrewsbury, connected with the Foundling Hospital; previously to  which he entered into a written engagement, guaranteed by a friend,  Mr. Bicknell, that within twelve months he would resign one of them  to a respectable mistress, as an apprentice, with a fee of one hundred  pounds; and, on her marriage, or commencing business for herself, he  would give her the additional sum of four hundred pounds; and he further  engaged that he would act honourably to the one he should retain, in  order to marry her at a proper age; or, if he should change his mind, he  would allow her a competent support until she married, and then give her  five hundred pounds as a dowry.    The objects of Day's speculation were both twelve years of age. One of  them, whom he called Lucretia, had a fair complexion, with light hair  and eyes; the other was a brunette, with chesnut tresses, who was styled  Sabrina. He took these girls to France without any English servants,  in order that they should not obtain any knowledge but what he should  impart. As might have been anticipated, they caused him abundance of  inconvenience and vexation, increased, in no small degree, by their  becoming infected with the small-pox; from this, however, they recovered  without any injury to their features. The scheme ended in the utter  disappointment of the projector. Lucretia, whom he first dismissed,  was apprenticed to a milliner; and she afterwards became the wife of a  linendraper in London. Sabrina, after Day had relinquished his attempts  to make her such a model of perfection as he required, and which included  indomitable courage, as well as the difficult art of retaining secrets,  was placed at a boarding-school at Sutton Coldfield, in Warwickshire,  where she was much esteemed; and, strange to say, was at length married  to Mr. Bicknell.    After Day had renounced this scheme as impracticable, he became suitor  to two sisters in succession; yet, in both instances, he was refused. At  length, he was married at Bath, to a lady who made \"a large fortune the  means of exercising the most extensive generosity.\"           *       *       *       *       *      WASHINGTON IRVING AND WILKIE, IN THE ALHAMBRA.    Geoffrey Crayon (Irving), and Wilkie, the painter, were fellow-travellers  on the Continent, about the year 1827. In their rambles about some of  the old cities of Spain, they were more than once struck with scenes and  incidents which reminded them of passages in the _Arabian Nights_. The  painter urged Mr. Irving to write something that should illustrate those  peculiarities, \"something in the 'Haroun-al-Raschid style,'\" which  should have a deal of that Arabian spice which pervades everything in  Spain. The author set to work, _con amore_, and produced two goodly  volumes of Arabesque sketches and tales, founded on popular traditions.  His study was the Alhambra, and the governor of the palace gave Irving  and Wilkie permission to occupy his vacant apartments there. Wilkie was  soon called away by the duties of his station; but Washington Irving  remained for several months, spell-bound in the old enchanted pile. \"How  many legends,\" saith he, \"and traditions, true and fabulous--how many  songs and romances, Spanish and Arabian, of love, and war, and chivalry,  are associated with this romantic pile.\"           *       *       *       *       *      BOLINGBROKE AT BATTERSEA.    When the late Sir Richard Phillips took his \"Morning's Walk from London  to Kew,\" in 1816, he found that a portion of the family mansion in which  Lord Bolingbroke was born had been converted into a mill and distillery,  though a small oak parlour had been carefully preserved. In this room,  Pope is said to have written his _Essay on Man_; and, in Bolingbroke's  time, the mansion was the resort, the hope, and the seat of enjoyment,  of Swift, Arbuthnot, Thomson, Mallet, and all the contemporary genius of  England. The oak room was always called \"Pope's Parlour,\" it being, in  all probability, the apartment generally occupied by that great poet, in  his visits to his friend Bolingbroke.    On inquiring for an ancient inhabitant of Battersea, Sir Richard  Phillips was introduced to a Mrs. Gilliard, a pleasant and intelligent  woman, who told him she well remembered Lord Bolingbroke; that he used  to ride out every day in his chariot, and had a black patch on his  cheek, with a large wart over his eyebrows. She was then but a girl,  but she was taught to look upon him with veneration as a great man. As,  however, he spent little in the place, and gave little away, he was not  much regarded by the people of Battersea. Sir Richard mentioned to  her the names of several of Bolingbroke's contemporaries; but she  recollected none except that of Mallet, who, she said, she had often  seen walking about in the village, while he was visiting at Bolingbroke  House.           *       *       *       *       *      RELICS OF MILTON.    Milton was born at the _Spread Eagle_,[8] Bread-street, Cheapside,  December 9, 1608; and was buried, November, 1674, in St. Giles's Church,  Cripplegate, without even a stone, in the first instance, to mark his  resting-place; but, in 1793, a bust and tablet were set up to his memory  by public subscription.    Milton, before he resided in Jewin-gardens, Aldersgate, is believed to  have removed to, and \"kept school\" in a large house on the west side of  Aldersgate-street, wherein met the City of London Literary and  Scientific Institution, previously to the rebuilding of their premises  in 1839.    Milton's London residences have all, with one exception, disappeared,  and cannot be recognised; this is in Petty France, at Westminster, where  the poet lived from 1651 to 1659. The lower part of the house is a  chandler's-shop; the parlour, up stairs, looks into St. James's-park.  Here part of _Paradise Lost_ was written. The house belonged to Jeremy  Bentham, who caused to be placed on its front a tablet, inscribed,  \"SACRED TO MILTON, PRINCE OF POETS.\"    In the same glass-case with Shakspeare's autograph, in the British  Museum, is a printed copy of the Elegies on Mr. Edward King, the subject  of _Lycidas_, with some corrections of the text in Milton's handwriting.  Framed and glazed, in the library of Mr. Rogers, the poet, hangs the  written agreement between Milton and his publisher, Simmons, for the  copyright of his _Paradise Lost_.--_Note-book of 1848._     [8] The house has been destroyed many years.           *       *       *       *       *      WRITING UP THE \"TIMES\" NEWSPAPER.    Dr. Dibdin, in his _Reminiscences_, relates:--\"Sir John Stoddart  married the sister of Lord Moncrieff, by whom he has a goodly race of  representatives; but, before his marriage, _he was the man who wrote  up the Times newspaper_ to its admitted pitch of distinction and  superiority over every other contemporary journal. Mark, gentle reader,  I speak of the _Times_ newspaper during the eventful and appalling  crisis of Bonaparte's invasion of Spain and destruction of Moscow. My  friend fought with his _pen_ as Wellington fought with his _sword_: but  nothing like a tithe of the remuneration which was justly meted out to  the hero of Waterloo befel the editor of the _Times_. Of course, I speak  of remuneration in degree, and not in kind. The peace followed. Public  curiosity lulled, and all great and stirring events having subsided, it  was thought that a writer of less commanding talent, (certainly not  the _present Editor_,) and therefore procurable at a less premium,  would answer the current purposes of the day; and the retirement of Dr.  Stoddart, (for he was at this time a civilian, and particularly noticed  and patronised by Lord Stowell,) from the old _Times_, and his  establishment of the _New Times_ newspaper, followed in consequence. But  the latter, from various causes, had only a short-lived existence. Sir  John Stoddart had been his Majesty's advocate, or Attorney-General, at  Malta, before he retired thither a _second_ time, to assume the office  of Judge.\"           *       *       *       *       *      RELICS OF THE BOAR'S HEAD TAVERN, EASTCHEAP.    The portal of the Boar's Head was originally decorated with carved oak  figures of Falstaff and Prince Henry; and in 1834, the former figure was  in the possession of a brazier, of Great Eastcheap, whose ancestors had  lived in the shop he then occupied since the great fire. The last grand  Shakspearean dinner-party took place at the Boar's Head about 1784. A  boar's head, with silver tusks, which had been suspended in some room in  the house, perhaps the Half Moon or Pomegranate, (see _Henry IV._, Act.  ii., scene 3,) at the great fire, fell down with the ruins of the  houses, little injured, and was conveyed to Whitechapel Mount, where it  was identified and recovered about thirty years ago.           *       *       *       *       *      ORIGIN OF \"THE EDINBURGH REVIEW.\"    The _Edinburgh Review_ was first published in 1802. The plan was  suggested by Sydney Smith, at a meeting of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3043"],[0,"The Quaker Colonies: A Chronicle of the Proprietors of the Delaware (#18)"],[1,". Anchoring before  Burlington in the evening, the colonists woke up next morning to find  the river frozen hard so that they walked on the ice to their future  habitations.    Burlington was made the capital of West Jersey, a legislature was  convened and laws were passed under the \"concessions\" or constitution  of the proprietors. Salem and Burlington became the ports of the little  province, which was well under way by 1682, when Penn came out to take  possession of Pennsylvania.    The West Jersey people of these two settlements spread eastward into the  interior but were stopped by a great forest area known as the Pines, or  Pine Barrens, of such heavy growth that even the Indians lived on its  outer edges and entered it only for hunting. It was an irregularly  shaped tract, full of wolves, bear, beaver, deer, and other game, and  until recent years has continued to attract sportsmen from all parts of  the country. Starting near Delaware Bay, it extended parallel with the  ocean as far north as the lower portion of the present Monmouth County  and formed a region about seventy-five miles long and thirty miles wide.  It was roughly the part of the old sandy shoal that first emerged from  the ocean, and it has been longer above water than any other part of  southern Jersey. The old name, Pine Barrens, is hardly correct because  it implies something like a desert, when as a matter of fact the region  produced magnificent forest trees.    The innumerable visitors who cross southern Jersey to the famous  seashore resorts always pass through the remains of this old central  forest and are likely to conclude that the monotonous low scrub oaks  and stunted pines on sandy level soil, seen for the last two or three  generations, were always there and that the primeval forest of colonial  times was no better. But that is a mistake. The stunted growth now seen  is not even second growth but in many cases fourth or fifth or more. The  whole region was cut over long ago. The original growth, pine in many  places, consisted also of lofty timber of oak, hickory, gum, ash,  chestnut, and numerous other trees, interspersed with dogwood,  sassafras, and holly, and in the swamps the beautiful magnolia, along  with the valuable white cedar. DeVries, who visited the Jersey coast  about 1632, at what is supposed to have been Beesley's or Somer's Point,  describes high woods coming down to the shore. Even today, immediately  back of Somer's Point, there is a magnificent lofty oak forest  accidentally preserved by surrounding marsh from the destructive  forest fires; and there are similar groves along the road towards  Pleasantville. In fact, the finest forest trees flourish in that region  wherever given a good chance. Even some of the beaches of Cape May had  valuable oak and luxuriant growths of red cedar; and until a few years  ago there were fine trees, especially hollies, surviving on Wildwood  Beach.    The Jersey white cedar swamps were, and still are, places of fascinating  interest to the naturalist and the botanist. The hunter or explorer  found them scattered almost everywhere in the old forest and near its  edges, varying in size from a few square yards up to hundreds of acres.  They were formed by little streams easily checked in their flow through  the level land by decaying vegetation or dammed by beavers. They kept  the water within the country, preventing all effects of droughts,  stimulating the growth of vegetation which by its decay, throughout  the centuries, was steadily adding vegetable mold or humus to the sandy  soil. This process of building up a richer soil has now been largely  stopped by lumbering, drainage, and fires.    While there are many of these swamps left, the appearance of numbers  of them has largely changed. When the white men first came, the great  cedars three or four feet in diameter which had fallen centuries before  often lay among the living trees, some of them buried deep in the mud  and preserved from decay. They were invaluable timber, and digging them  out and cutting them up became an important industry for over a hundred  years. In addition to being used for boat building, they made excellent  shingles which would last a lifetime. The swamps, indeed, became known  as shingle mines, and it was a good description of them. An important  trade was developed in hogshead staves, hoops, shingles, boards, and  planks, much of which went into the West Indian trade to be exchanged  for rum, sugar, molasses, and negroes. *          * Between the years 1740 and '50, the Cedar Swamps of the county  [Cape May] were mostly located; and the amount of lumber since taken  from them is incalculable, not only as an article of trade, but to  supply the home demand for fencing and building material in the county.  Large portions of these swamps have been worked a second and some a  third time, since located. At the present time [1857] there is not an  acre of original growth of swamp standing, having all passed away  before the resistless sway of the speculator or the consumer. \"Beesley's  \"Sketch of Cape May\" p. 197.      The great forest has long since been lumbered to death. The pines were  worked for tar, pitch, resin, and turpentine until for lack of material  the industry passed southward through the Carolinas to Florida,  exhausting the trees as it went. The Christmas demand for holly has  almost stripped the Jersey woods of these trees once so numerous.  Destructive fires and frequent cutting keep the pine and oak lands  stunted. Thousands of dollars' worth of cedar springing up in the swamps  are sometimes destroyed in a day. But efforts to control the fires so  destructive not only to this standing timber but to the fertility of  the soil, and attempts to reforest this country not only for the sake  of timber but as an attraction to those who resort there in search of  health or natural beauty, have not been vigorously pushed. The great  forest has now, to be sure, been partially cultivated in spots, and the  sand used for large glass-making industries. Small fruits and grapes  flourish in some places. At the northern end of this forest tract the  health resort known as Lakewood was established to take advantage of the  pine air. A little to the southward is the secluded Brown's Mills, once  so appealing to lovers of the simple life. Checked on the east by the  great forest, the West Jersey Quakers spread southward from Salem until  they came to the Cohansey, a large and beautiful stream flowing out of  the forest and wandering through green meadows and marshes to the bay.  So numerous were the wild geese along its shores and along the Maurice  River farther south that the first settlers are said to have killed them  for their feathers alone and to have thrown the carcasses away. At the  head of navigation of the Cohansey was a village called Cohansey Bridge,  and after 1765 Bridgeton, a name still borne by a flourishing modern  town. Lower down near the marsh was the village of Greenwich, the  principal place of business up to the year 1800, with a foreign trade.  Some of the tea the East India Company tried to force on the colonists  during the Revolution was sent there and was duly rejected. It is still  an extremely pretty village, with its broad shaded streets like a New  England town and its old Quaker meeting house. In fact, not a few New  Englanders from Connecticut, still infatuated with southern Jersey in  spite of the rebuffs received in ancient times from Dutch and Swedes,  finally settled near the Cohansey after it came under control of the  more amiable Quakers. There was also one place called after Fairfield in  Connecticut and another called New England Town.    The first churches of this region were usually built near running  streams so that the congregation could procure water for themselves and  their horses. Of one old Presbyterian Church it used to be said that  no one had ever ridden to it in a wheeled vehicle. Wagons and carriages  were very scarce until after the Revolution. Carts for occasions of  ceremony as well as utility were used before wagons and carriages. For a  hundred and fifty years the horse's back was the best form of conveyance  in the deep sand of the trails and roads. This was true of all southern  Jersey. Pack horses and the backs of Indian and negro slaves were the  principal means of transportation on land. The roads and trails, in  fact, were so few and so heavy with sand that water travel was very  much developed. The Indian dugout canoe was adopted and found faster  and better than heavy English rowboats. As the province was almost  surrounded by water and was covered with a network of creeks and  channels, nearly all the villages and towns were situated on tidewater  streams, and the dugout canoe, modified and improved, was for several  generations the principal means of communication. Most of the old roads  in New Jersey followed Indian trails. There was a trail, for example,  from the modern Camden opposite Philadelphia, following up Cooper's  Creek past Berlin, then called Long-a-coming, crossing the watershed,  and then following Great Egg Harbor River to the seashore. Another  trail, long used by the settlers, led from Salem up to Camden,  Burlington, and Trenton, going round the heads of streams. It was  afterwards abandoned for the shorter route obtained by bridging the  streams nearer their mouths. This old trail also extended from the  neighborhood of Trenton to Perth Amboy near the mouth of the Hudson, and  thus, by supplementing the lower routes, made a trail nearly the whole  length of the province.    As a Quaker refuge, West Jersey never attained the success of  Pennsylvania. The political disturbances and the continually threatened  loss of self-government in both the Jerseys were a serious deterrent to  Quakers who, above all else, prized rights which they found far better  secured in Pennsylvania.
