And they ate, both of them, in all  love, and in good-liking of life, and were much strengthened by their  supper.  And when they were done, Walter eked his fire, both against the  chill of the midnight and dawning, and for a guard against wild beasts,  and by that time night was come, and the moon arisen.  Then the Maiden  drew up to the fire, and turned to Walter and spake.          CHAPTER XXIV: THE MAID TELLS OF WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HER      \"Now, friend, by the clear of the moon and this firelight will I tell  what I may and can of my tale.  Thus it is: If I be wholly of the race of  Adam I wot not nor can I tell thee how many years old I may be.  For  there are, as it were, shards or gaps in my life, wherein are but a few  things dimly remembered, and doubtless many things forgotten.  I remember  well when I was a little child, and right happy, and there were people  about me whom I loved, and who loved me.  It was not in this land; but  all things were lovely there; the year's beginning, the happy mid-year,  the year's waning, the year's ending, and then again its beginning.  That  passed away, and then for a while is more than dimness, for nought I  remember save that I was.  Thereafter I remember again, and am a young  maiden, and I know some things, and long to know more.  I am nowise  happy; I am amongst people who bid me go, and I go; and do this, and I do  it: none loveth me, none tormenteth me; but I wear my heart in longing  for I scarce know what.  Neither then am I in this land, but in a land  that I love not, and a house that is big and stately, but nought lovely.  Then is a dim time again, and sithence a time not right clear; an evil  time, wherein I am older, wellnigh grown to womanhood.  There are a many  folk about me, and they foul, and greedy, and hard; and my spirit is  fierce, and my body feeble; and I am set to tasks that I would not do, by  them that are unwiser than I; and smitten I am by them that are less  valiant than I; and I know lack, and stripes, and divers misery.  But all  that is now become but a dim picture to me, save that amongst all these  unfriends is a friend to me; an old woman, who telleth me sweet tales of  other life, wherein all is high and goodly, or at the least valiant and  doughty, and she setteth hope in my heart and learneth me, and maketh me  to know much . . . O much . . . so that at last I am grown wise, and wise  to be mighty if I durst.  Yet am I nought in this land all this while,  but, as meseemeth, in a great and a foul city.\"    \"And then, as it were, I fall asleep; and in my sleep is nought, save  here and there a wild dream, somedeal lovely, somedeal hideous: but of  this dream is my Mistress a part, and the monster, withal, whose head  thou didst cleave to-day.  But when I am awaken from it, then am I verily  in this land, and myself, as thou seest me to-day.  And the first part of  my life here is this, that I am in the pillared ball yonder, half-clad  and with bound hands; and the Dwarf leadeth me to the Lady, and I hear  his horrible croak as he sayeth: 'Lady, will this one do?' and then the  sweet voice of the Lady saying: 'This one will do; thou shalt have thy  reward: now, set thou the token upon her.'  Then I remember the Dwarf  dragging me away, and my heart sinking for fear of him: but for that time  he did me no more harm than the rivetting upon my leg this iron ring  which here thou seest.\"    \"So from that time forward I have lived in this land, and been the thrall  of the Lady; and I remember my life here day by day, and no part of it  has fallen into the dimness of dreams.  Thereof will I tell thee but  little: but this I will tell thee, that in spite of my past dreams, or it  may be because of them, I had not lost the wisdom which the old woman had  erst learned me, and for more wisdom I longed.  Maybe this longing shall  now make both thee and me happy, but for the passing time it brought me  grief.  For at first my Mistress was indeed wayward with me, but as any  great lady might be with her bought thrall, whiles caressing me, and  whiles chastising me, as her mood went; but she seemed not to be cruel of  malice, or with any set purpose.  But so it was (rather little by little  than by any great sudden uncovering of my intent), that she came to know  that I also had some of the wisdom whereby she lived her queenly life.  That was about two years after I was first her thrall, and three weary  years have gone by since she began to see in me the enemy of her days.  Now why or wherefore I know not, but it seemeth that it would not avail  her to slay me outright, or suffer me to die; but nought withheld her  from piling up griefs and miseries on my head.  At last she set her  servant, the Dwarf, upon me, even he whose head thou clavest to-day.  Many  things I bore from him whereof it were unseemly for my tongue to tell  before thee; but the time came when he exceeded, and I could bear no  more; and then I showed him this sharp knife (wherewith I would have  thrust me through to the heart if thou hadst not pardoned me e'en now),  and I told him that if he forbore me not, I would slay, not him, but  myself; and this he might not away with because of the commandment of the  Lady, who had given him the word that in any case I must be kept living.  And her hand, withal, fear held somewhat hereafter.  Yet was there need  to me of all my wisdom; for with all this her hatred grew, and whiles  raged within her so furiously that it overmastered her fear, and at such  times she would have put me to death if I had not escaped her by some  turn of my lore.\"    \"Now further, I shall tell thee that somewhat more than a year ago hither  to this land came the King's Son, the second goodly man, as thou art the  third, whom her sorceries have drawn hither since I have dwelt here.  Forsooth, when he first came, he seemed to us, to me, and yet more to my  Lady, to be as beautiful as an angel, and sorely she loved him; and he  her, after his fashion: but he was light-minded, and cold-hearted, and in  a while he must needs turn his eyes upon me, and offer me his love, which  was but foul and unkind as it turned out; for when I nay-said him, as  maybe I had not done save for fear of my Mistress, he had no pity upon  me, but spared not to lead me into the trap of her wrath, and leave me  without help, or a good word.  But, O friend, in spite of all grief and  anguish, I learned still, and waxed wise, and wiser, abiding the day of  my deliverance, which has come, and thou art come.\"    Therewith she took Walter's hands and kissed them; but he kissed her  face, and her tears wet her lips.  Then she went on: \"But sithence,  months ago, the Lady began to weary of this dastard, despite of his  beauty; and then it was thy turn to be swept into her net; I partly guess  how.  For on a day in broad daylight, as I was serving my Mistress in the  hall, and the Evil Thing, whose head is now cloven, was lying across the  threshold of the door, as it were a dream fell upon me, though I strove  to cast it off for fear of chastisement; for the pillared hall wavered,  and vanished from my sight, and my feet were treading a rough stone  pavement instead of the marble wonder of the hall, and there was the  scent of the salt sea and of the tackle of ships, and behind me were tall  houses, and before me the ships indeed, with their ropes beating and  their sails flapping and their masts wavering; and in mine ears was the  hale and how of mariners; things that I had seen and heard in the dimness  of my life gone by.\"    \"And there was I, and the Dwarf before me, and the Lady after me, going  over the gangway aboard of a tall ship, and she gathered way and was  gotten out of the haven, and straightway I saw the mariners cast abroad  their ancient.\"    Quoth Walter: \"What then!  Sawest thou the blazon thereon, of a wolf-like  beast ramping up against a maiden?  And that might well have been thou.\"    She said: \"Yea, so it was; but refrain thee, that I may tell on my tale!  The ship and the sea vanished away, but I was not back in the hall of the  Golden House; and again were we three in the street of the self-same town  which we had but just left; but somewhat dim was my vision thereof, and I  saw little save the door of a goodly house before me, and speedily it  died out, and we were again in the pillared hall, wherein my thralldom  was made manifest.\"    \"Maiden,\" said Walter, \"one question I would ask thee; to wit, didst thou  see me on the quay by the ships?\"    \"Nay,\" she said, \"there were many folk about, but they were all as images  of the aliens to me.  Now hearken further: three months thereafter came  the dream upon me again, when we were all three together in the Pillared  Hall; and again was the vision somewhat dim.  Once more we were in the  street of a busy town, but all unlike to that other one, and there were  men standing together on our right hands by the door of a house.\"    \"Yea, yea,\" quoth Walter; \"and, forsooth, one of them was who but I.\"    \"Refrain thee, beloved!\" she said; \"for my tale draweth to its ending,  and I would have thee hearken heedfully: for maybe thou shalt once again  deem my deed past pardon.  Some twenty days after this last dream, I had  some leisure from my Mistress's service, so I went to disport me by the  Well of the Oak-tree (or forsooth she might have set in my mind the  thought of going there, that I might meet thee and give her some occasion  against me); and I sat thereby, nowise loving the earth, but sick at  heart, because of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30550"],[0,"Finn The Wolfhound (#18)"],[1,"silent, and began, tentatively and in a half-hearted  way, to lick some of his bruises and abrasions. Then, before  this task was half accomplished, wise Nature asserted her claims,  and the exhausted Wolfhound fell into a fitful sleep just before  daybreak. When he woke, fully a couple of hours later, much of  his pain and misery remained with him; but the fear had given  place to other feelings, chief among which came the determination  to escape from the dominion of Matey. His own short experience of  life gave Finn nothing to draw upon in coping with the situation in  which he now found himself. He was drawing now, not upon teaching  or experience, but upon what we call instinct: the store of  concentrated inherited experience with which Nature furnishes all  created things, and some more richly than others. Deep down in  Finn's share of this store there were faint stirrings in the  direction of hatred and vengeance; but of these, Finn was not  actually conscious as yet. What he was acutely conscious of was the  determination with which instinct supplied him to seize the very  first opportunity of getting clear away from his present  environment, and from Matey. So much, instinct taught him: that he  must get his freedom if he could, and that he must never, never  again, for one moment, trust Matey. This was only the surface of  the lesson instinct taught him. There was a lot more in the lesson  which would permanently affect Finn's attitude toward humans and  toward life itself. But the surface was the immediate thing; to win  to freedom, and never to trust Matey again.    The first result of Finn's lesson was that he examined the whole of  his prison very carefully, by the aid chiefly of his sense of smell  and touch. There was hardly any light in the place. His nose was  very sore, because Matey's stick had knocked a large piece of skin  from it and bruised it badly. Also, the smell of every part of  Finn's prison was revolting to him. But, though with sensitively  wrinkled nostrils, Finn made his examination very thoroughly. And  in the end he decided that he could do nothing for the present.  Three sides of his prison were brick-work, and the fourth, the  door, presented no edge or corner which his teeth could touch. So  Finn sat still, waiting, listening, and watching, with his tongue  hanging out a little on one side of his mouth, by reason of the  horrid dryness which afflicted his throat. And every hour that he  waited brought greater strength to his determination, besides  teaching him something in the way of patience and caution.    Presently, the waiting Finn heard heavy footsteps in the yard  outside, and the muscles of his body gathered themselves together  for action. The door opened, and Finn saw Matey standing there with  a stick and a chain in his hand. Instinct told Finn on the instant  that he must at all hazards avoid both the stick and the chain;  but, more than anything else, the chain.    \"Come 'ere!\" said Matey. And Finn came. But, whereas Matey had  reckoned on a slow movement, in the course of which his hand would  have fallen on Finn's slip-collar preparatory to fixing the chain  on that, the movement was actually very swift and low to the  ground, and resulted in Finn's passing out scathless into the  walled-in yard.    \"Oho! So we don't like our new master, don't we? Haven't forgotten  our blooming gruellin', eh? Better take care we don't get some more  o' the same sort, Mister Wolfhound, if you arst me!\"    The walled-in yard was quite safe. Matey was in nowise perturbed,  and, moreover, having slept soundly and breakfasted copiously, he  was, for him, in an amiable mood. Still, he had no wish to waste  time, and he wanted to overhaul his plunder, and groom Finn up a  little before the prospective purchaser arrived. So Matey turned  round, leaned forward with a hand resting on one knee, and tried to  twist his features into an ingratiating expression, as he said--    \"Here, then, good dog! Come on, Finn! Here, boy!\"    But instinct made Finn's intelligence upon the whole superior to  Matey's in this matter, and, having already satisfied himself by  means of hurried investigation that at present he could not escape  from the walled-in yard, the Wolfhound stood half a dozen paces  distant from the man, waiting, with every nerve and muscle at  concert pitch. The man moved forward, with hand outstretched  invitingly. The Wolfhound moved backward, with hackles slightly  raised. Thus they followed each other round the little yard perhaps  six times, the distance between them being maintained with nicety  and precision by Finn. Then Matey's mental inferiority appeared. He  was expecting very shortly now the man from whom he hoped to  receive his reward--the price of Finn. His intelligence, such as it  was, told him that strategy would now be necessary to enable him to  lay hands on the Wolfhound; but, even while recognising that, he  could not refrain from angrily flinging his chain in Finn's face,  after his sixth promenade of the yard, and cursing the dog  savagely, before retiring into the house to prepare a stratagem.    Finn did not snarl as the chain struck him. Instinct had not  carried him so far from education. But he barked angrily, and  bounded to one side. While the man was away Finn examined the gate  of the yard through which he had been driven on the previous night,  and, though it rattled hopefully when he plunged against it with  his fore-paws, raised high above its fastening, it remained solidly  closed.    As Finn turned away from the doors of the yard, Matey appeared from  the house, holding in one outstretched hand a piece of the same  kind of meat with which he had seduced Finn into accompanying him  on the previous evening, and calling the hound to him in a friendly  tone. But Finn had learned a good deal since his first taste of  that savoury meat; more a good deal than the man who offered the  meat had learned in the same time. Taking the middle of the yard,  so as to leave himself ample space for retreat, he remained  watchfully regarding Matey, and refused to advance a step. Matey's  spoken blandishments were now a dead letter to Finn. Having once  discovered the possibilities of human treachery, he would never  forget them. And here the folk who belong to what we call the brute  creation are apt to be a good deal wiser than their betters in the  scale of evolution. They do not forget the teaching of experience  so readily as do those of us who are farther removed from Nature.  To be sure, Matey's notion of strategy was puerile enough; but,  apart from that, it is safe to assume that Finn would never again  completely trust this man, who had been the first to introduce him  to fear and misery, to humiliation, and to knowledge of the  existence of treachery and cruelty in men folk.    Matey cursed the Wolfhound angrily, but that did not incline Finn  to trust him any the more. Then the man advanced a little in his  strategy, and tossed a piece of the meat on to the ground, before  Finn, to inspire confidence. But Finn's mistrust was too profound  to admit of his stooping to pick this up. He was not very specially  hungry, in any case; and if Matey had been an observant creature,  or even one who used his memory wisely, he would have known that  the offer of drinking-water would have been infinitely more  tempting to Finn than any quantity of savoury meat. But, as a fact,  Finn was too much possessed just now by his determination to escape  from Matey and all his works to be very clearly conscious of any  other need.    Then, his petty strategy exhausted, and his paltry measure of self-control  with it, Matey started to chase Finn with a stick. Now and  again he succeeded in getting a blow home, as Finn wheeled and  leapt before him within the narrow limits of the yard; and every  time the stick touched him Finn barked angrily. This performance  was extremely bad for Finn. It was calculated to break down some of  the most valuable among his acquired qualities; the characteristics  that he acquired with his blood through many generations of wisely-bred  and humanely-reared hounds. In one sense it was more harmful  than the merciless and unreasonable punishment of the previous  night, because there was no faintest hint of a punishment about it;  not even of the sort of punishment that had followed his howling.  That had had the bad qualities of cruelty and unreasonableness,  unjustifiableness. This was not punishment at all, it was sheer  savagery, the savagery of a running fight in which the man, though  he might hurt occasionally, could not conquer. And that is a most  demoralizing sort of a happening, as between dog and man. Its  demoralizing influence could have been detected by an observant  spectator in the notes of Finn's barks when the stick reached him.  They approached momentarily nearer the threatening nature of a  growl; a new, dangerous note to hear in Finn's speech with mankind.    Matey was rapidly becoming exhausted, and in another moment or two  would probably have flung his stick at Finn and given up his  senseless pursuit, when, just as the Wolfhound bounded forward from  under his stick at the house end of the yard, the gate leading into  that yard opened, and Bill appeared. In an instant Finn had sprung  for the opening, Bill's legs were thrust from under him, and as he  stumbled, with one hand on the ground and an oath on his lips, Finn  reached the open road outside. Behind him, for a moment, Finn heard  a hurried scrambling, and a deal of broken, breathless whistling,  and calling aloud of his name. And then he heard no more from the  place of his captivity and anguish, for the reason that he was  already nearing the limits of the little town, and galloping hard  for the open country, over the road by which he had travelled some  ten hours earlier in Matey's cart.
