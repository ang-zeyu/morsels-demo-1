Sweeter it is, my friends, if he  Howl like a dolt: 'tis meant for me!  But sweeter still it is to arrange  For him an honourable grave,  At his pale brow a shot to have,  Placed at the customary range;  But home his body to despatch  Can scarce in sweetness be a match.    XXXII    Well, if your pistol ball by chance  The comrade of your youth should strike,  Who by a haughty word or glance  Or any trifle else ye like  You o'er your wine insulted hath--  Or even overcome by wrath  Scornfully challenged you afield--  Tell me, of sentiments concealed  Which in your spirit dominates,  When motionless your gaze beneath  He lies, upon his forehead death,  And slowly life coagulates--  When deaf and silent he doth lie  Heedless of your despairing cry?    XXXIII    Eugene, his pistol yet in hand  And with remorseful anguish filled,  Gazing on Lenski's corse did stand--  Zaretski shouted: \"Why, he's killed!\"--  Killed! at this dreadful exclamation  Oneguine went with trepidation  And the attendants called in haste.  Most carefully Zaretski placed  Within his sledge the stiffened corse,  And hurried home his awful freight.  Conscious of death approximate,  Loud paws the earth each panting horse,  His bit with foam besprinkled o'er,  And homeward like an arrow tore.    XXXIV    My friends, the poet ye regret!  When hope's delightful flower but bloomed  In bud of promise incomplete,  The manly toga scarce assumed,  He perished. Where his troubled dreams,  And where the admirable streams  Of youthful impulse, reverie,  Tender and elevated, free?  And where tempestuous love's desires,  The thirst of knowledge and of fame,  Horror of sinfulness and shame,  Imagination's sacred fires,  Ye shadows of a life more high,  Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?    XXXV    Perchance to benefit mankind,  Or but for fame he saw the light;  His lyre, to silence now consigned,  Resounding through all ages might  Have echoed to eternity.  With worldly honours, it may be,  Fortune the poet had repaid.  It may be that his martyred shade  Carried a truth divine away;  That, for the century designed,  Had perished a creative mind,  And past the threshold of decay,  He ne'er shall hear Time's eulogy,  The blessings of humanity.    XXXVI    Or, it may be, the bard had passed  A life in common with the rest;  Vanished his youthful years at last,  The fire extinguished in his breast,  In many things had changed his life--  The Muse abandoned, ta'en a wife,  Inhabited the country, clad  In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:  A life of fact, not fiction, led--  At forty suffered from the gout,  Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:  And finally, upon his bed  Had finished life amid his sons,  Doctors and women, sobs and groans.    XXXVII    But, howsoe'er his lot were cast,  Alas! the youthful lover slain,  Poetical enthusiast,  A friendly hand thy life hath ta'en!  There is a spot the village near  Where dwelt the Muses' worshipper,  Two pines have joined their tangled roots,  A rivulet beneath them shoots  Its waters to the neighbouring vale.  There the tired ploughman loves to lie,  The reaping girls approach and ply  Within its wave the sounding pail,  And by that shady rivulet  A simple tombstone hath been set.    XXXVIII    There, when the rains of spring we mark  Upon the meadows showering,  The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,(66)  Of Volga fishermen doth sing,  And the young damsel from the town,  For summer to the country flown,  Whene'er across the plain at speed  Alone she gallops on her steed,  Stops at the tomb in passing by;  The tightened leathern rein she draws,  Aside she casts her veil of gauze  And reads with rapid eager eye  The simple epitaph--a tear  Doth in her gentle eye appear.    [Note 66: In Russia and other northern countries rude shoes are  made of the inner bark of the lime tree.]    XXXIX    And meditative from the spot  She leisurely away doth ride,  Spite of herself with Lenski's lot  Longtime her mind is occupied.  She muses: \"What was Olga's fate?  Longtime was her heart desolate  Or did her tears soon cease to flow?  And where may be her sister now?  Where is the outlaw, banned by men,  Of fashionable dames the foe,  The misanthrope of gloomy brow,  By whom the youthful bard was slain?\"--  In time I'll give ye without fail  A true account and in detail.    XL    But not at present, though sincerely  I on my chosen hero dote;  Though I'll return to him right early,  Just at this moment I cannot.  Years have inclined me to stern prose,  Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,  And now, I mournfully confess,  In rhyming I show laziness.  As once, to fill the rapid page  My pen no longer finds delight,  Other and colder thoughts affright,  Sterner solicitudes engage,  In worldly din or solitude  Upon my visions such intrude.    XLI    Fresh aspirations I have known,  I am acquainted with fresh care,  Hopeless are all the first, I own,  Yet still remains the old despair.  Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?  Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?  And is it true her garland bright  At last is shrunk and withered quite?  And is it true and not a jest,  Not even a poetic phrase,  That vanished are my youthful days  (This joking I used to protest),  Never for me to reappear--  That soon I reach my thirtieth year?    XLII    And so my noon hath come! If so,  I must resign myself, in sooth;  Yet let us part in friendship, O  My frivolous and jolly youth.  I thank thee for thy joyfulness,  Love's tender transports and distress,  For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,  And all that from thy hand proceeds--  I thank thee. In thy company,  With tumult or contentment still  Of thy delights I drank my fill,  Enough! with tranquil spirit I  Commence a new career in life  And rest from bygone days of strife.    XLIII    But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,  Where my days in the wilderness  Of languor and of love did tell  And contemplative dreaminess;  And thou, youth's early inspiration,  Invigorate imagination  And spur my spirit's torpid mood!  Fly frequent to my solitude,  Let not the poet's spirit freeze,  Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,  Eventually petrify  In the world's mortal revelries,  Amid the soulless sons of pride  And glittering simpletons beside;    XLIV    Amid sly, pusillanimous  Spoiled children most degenerate  And tiresome rogues ridiculous  And stupid censors passionate;  Amid coquettes who pray to God  And abject slaves who kiss the rod;  In haunts of fashion where each day  All with urbanity betray,  Where harsh frivolity proclaims  Its cold unfeeling sentences;  Amid the awful emptiness  Of conversation, thought and aims--  In that morass where you and I  Wallow, my friends, in company!

A smile from slumbering nature clear  Did seem to greet the youthful year;  The heavens shone in deeper blue,  The woods, still naked to the view,  Seemed in a haze of green embowered.  The bee forth from his cell of wax  Flew to collect his rural tax;  The valleys dried and gaily flowered;  Herds low, and under night's dark veil  Already sings the nightingale.    II    Mournful is thine approach to me,  O Spring, thou chosen time of love!  What agitation languidly  My spirit and my blood doth move,  What sad emotions o'er me steal  When first upon my cheek I feel  The breath of Spring again renewed,  Secure in rural quietude--  Or, strange to me is happiness?  Do all things which to mirth incline.  And make a dark existence shine  Inflict annoyance and distress  Upon a soul inert and cloyed?--  And is all light within destroyed?    III    Or, heedless of the leaves' return  Which Autumn late to earth consigned,  Do we alone our losses mourn  Of which the rustling woods remind?  Or, when anew all Nature teems,  Do we foresee in troubled dreams  The coming of life's Autumn drear.  For which no springtime shall appear?  Or, it may be, we inly seek,  Wafted upon poetic wing,  Some other long-departed Spring,  Whose memories make the heart beat quick  With thoughts of a far distant land,  Of a strange night when the moon and--    IV    'Tis now the season! Idlers all,  Epicurean philosophers,  Ye men of fashion cynical,  Of Levshin's school ye followers,(67)  Priams of country populations  And dames of fine organisations,  Spring summons you to her green bowers,  'Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;  The time for mystic strolls which late  Into the starry night extend.  Quick to the country let us wend  In vehicles surcharged with freight;  In coach or post-cart duly placed  Beyond the city-barriers haste.    [Note 67: Levshin--a contemporary writer on political economy.]    V    Thou also, reader generous,  The chaise long ordered please employ,  Abandon cities riotous,  Which in the winter were a joy:  The Muse capricious let us coax,  Go hear the rustling of the oaks  Beside a nameless rivulet,  Where in the country Eugene yet,  An idle anchorite and sad,  A while ago the winter spent,  Near young Tattiana resident,  My pretty self-deceiving maid--  No more the village knows his face,  For there he left a mournful trace.

When thou reachest the city thou canst wear them again.\"  She then gave up to him all her ornaments, which were of great value.  Thereupon he inveigled the slave girl into the depths of the forest,  where he murdered her, and left her body to be devoured by wild beasts.  Lastly, returning to my poor mistress, he induced her to leave the hut  with him, and pushed her by force into a dry well, after which exploit  he set out alone with his ill-gotten wealth, walking towards his own  city.    In the meantime, a wayfaring man, who was passing through that jungle,  hearing the sound of weeping, stood still, and began to say to himself,  \"How came to my ears the voice of a mortal's grief in this wild wood?\"  then followed the direction of the noise, which led him a pit, and  peeping over the side, he saw a woman crying at the bottom. The  traveller at once loosened his gird cloth, knotted it to his turband,  and letting down the line pulled out the poor bride. He asked her who  she was and how she came to fall into that well. She replied, \"I am the  daughter of Hemgupt, the wealthiest merchant in the city of Chandrapur;  and I was journeying with my husband to his own country, when robbers  set upon us and surrounded us. They slew my slave girl, the threw me  into a well, and having bound my husband they took him away, together  with my jewels. I have no tidings of him, nor he of me.\" And so saying,  she burst into tears and lamentations.    The wayfaring man believed her tale, and conducted her to her home,  where she gave the same account of the accident which had befallen her,  ending with, \"beyond this, I know not if they have killed my husband, or  have let him go.\" The father thus soothed her grief \"Daughter! have no  anxiety; thy husband is alive, and by the will of the Deity he will come  to thee in a few days. Thieves take men's money, not their lives.\" Then  the parents presented her with ornaments more precious than those which  she had lost; and summoning their relations and friends, they comforted  her to the best of their power.    And so did I. The wicked hunchback had, meanwhile, returned to his own  city, where he was excellently well received, because he brought much  wealth with him. His old associates flocked around him rejoicing; and he  fell into the same courses which had beggared him before. Gambling and  debauchery soon blunted his passions, and emptied his purse. Again his  boon companions, finding him without a broken cowrie, drove him from  their doors, he stole and was flogged for theft; and lastly, half  famished, he fled the city. Then he said to himself, \"I must go to my  father-in-law, and make the excuse that a grandson has been born to him,  and that I have come to offer him congratulations on the event.\"    Imagine, however, his fears and astonishment, when, as he entered the  house, his wife stood before him. At first he thought it was a ghost,  and turned to run away, but she went out to him and said, \"Husband,  be not troubled! I have told my father that thieves came upon us, and  killed the slave girl and robbed me and threw me into a well, and bound  thee and carried thee off. Tell the same story, and put away all anxious  feelings. Come up and change thy tattered garments-alas! some misfortune  hath befallen thee. But console thyself; all is now well, since thou  art returned to me, and fear not, for the house is thine, and I am thy  slave.\"    The wretch, with all his hardness of heart, could scarcely refrain from  tears. He followed his wife to her room, where she washed his feet,  caused him to bathe, dressed him in new clothes, and placed food before  him. When her parents returned, she presented him to their embrace,  saying in a glad way, \"Rejoice with me, O my father and mother! the  robbers have at length allowed him to come back to us.\" Of course the  parents were deceived, they are mostly a purblind race; and Hemgupt,  showing great favour to his worthless son-in-law, exclaimed, \"Remain  with us, my son, and be happy!\"    For two or three months the hunchback lived quietly with his wife,  treating her kindly and even affectionately. But this did not last long.  He made acquaintance with a band of thieves, and arranged his plans with  them.    After a time, his wife one night came to sleep by his side, having put  on all her jewels. At midnight, when he saw that she was fast asleep,  he struck her with a knife so that she died. Then he admitted his  accomplices, who savagely murdered Hemgupt and his wife; and with their  assistance he carried off any valuable article upon which he could lay  his hands. The ferocious wretch! As he passed my cage he looked at it,  and thought whether he had time to wring my neck. The barking of a dog  saved my life; but my mistress, my poor Ratnawati-ah, me! ah, me!--    \"Queen,\" said the jay, in deepest grief, \"all this have I seen with mine  own eyes, and have heard with mine own ears. It affected me in early  life, and gave me a dislike for the society of the other sex. With due  respect to you, I have resolved to remain an old maid. Let your majesty  reflect, what crime had my poor mistress committed? A male is of the  same disposition as a highway robber; and she who forms friendship with  such an one, cradles upon her bosom a black and venomous snake.\"    \"Sir Parrot,\" said the jay, turning to her wooer, \"I have spoken. I  have nothing more to say, but that you he-things are all a treacherous,  selfish, wicked race, created for the express purpose of working our  worldly woe, and--\"    \"When a female, O my king, asserts that she has nothing more to say,  but,\" broke in Churaman, the parrot with a loud dogmatical voice, \"I  know that what she has said merely whets her tongue for what she is  about to say. This person has surely spoken long enough and drearily  enough.\"    \"Tell me, then, O parrot,\" said the king, \"what faults there may be in  the other sex.\"    \"I will relate,\" quoth Churaman, \"an occurrence which in my early youth  determined me to live and to die an old bachelor.\"    When quite a young bird, and before my schooling began, I was caught  in the land of Malaya, and was sold to a very rich merchant called  Sagardati, a widower with one daughter, the lady Jayashri. As her father  spent all his days and half his nights in his counting-house, conning  his ledgers and scolding his writers, that young woman had more liberty  than is generally allowed to those of her age, and a mighty bad use she  made of it.    O king! men commit two capital mistakes in rearing the \"domestic  calamity,\" and these are over-vigilance and under-vigilance. Some  parents never lose sight of their daughters, suspect them of all evil  intentions, and are silly enough to show their suspicions, which is an  incentive to evil-doing. For the weak-minded things do naturally say,  \"I will be wicked at once. What do I now but suffer all the pains and  penalties of badness, without enjoying its pleasures?\" And so they are  guilty of many evil actions; for, however vigilant fathers and mothers  may be, the daughter can always blind their eyes.    On the other hand, many parents take no trouble whatever with their  charges: they allow them to sit in idleness, the origin of badness; they  permit them to communicate with the wicked, and they give them liberty  which breeds opportunity. Thus they also, falling into the snares of the  unrighteous, who are ever a more painstaking race than the righteous,  are guilty of many evil actions.    What, then, must wise parents do? The wise will study the characters of  their children, and modify their treatment accordingly. If a daughter be  naturally good, she will be treated with a prudent confidence. If she  be vicious, an apparent trust will be reposed in her; but her father and  mother will secretly ever be upon their guard. The one-idea'd--    \"All this parrot-prate, I suppose, is only intended to vex me,\" cried  the warrior king, who always considered himself, and very naturally, a  person of such consequence as ever to be uppermost in the thoughts and  minds of others. \"If thou must tell a tale, then tell one, Vampire! or  else be silent, as I am sick to the death of thy psychics.\"    \"It is well, O warrior king,\" resumed the Baital.    After that Churaman the parrot had given the young Raja Ram a golden  mine full of good advice about the management of daughters, he proceeded  to describe Jayashri.    She was tall, stout, and well made, of lymphatic temperament, and yet  strong passions. Her fine large eyes had heavy and rather full eyelids,  which are to be avoided. Her hands were symmetrical without being small,  and the palms were ever warm and damp. Though her lips were good, her  mouth was somewhat underhung; and her voice was so deep, that at times  it sounded like that of a man. Her hair was smooth as the kokila's  plume, and her complexion was that of the young jasmine; and these were  the points at which most persons looked. Altogether, she was neither  handsome nor ugly, which is an excellent thing in woman. Sita the  goddess[77] was lovely to excess; therefore she was carried away by a  demon. Raja Bali was exceedingly generous, and he emptied his treasury.  In this way, exaggeration, even of good, is exceedingly bad.    Yet must I confess, continued the parrot, that, as a rule, the beautiful  woman is more virtuous than the ugly. The former is often tempted, but  her vanity and conceit enable her to resist, by the self-promise that  she shall be tempted again and again. On the other hand, the ugly woman  must tempt instead of being tempted, and she must yield, because her  vanity and conceit are gratified by yielding, not by resisting.    \"Ho, there!\" broke in the jay"]]]
