No part of the interior of the hive should be below the level of the  place of exit.    If this principle is violated, the bees must, at great disadvantage,  drag their dead, and all the refuse of the hive, _up hill_. Such hives  will often have their bottom boards covered with small pieces of comb,  bee-bread, and other impurities, in which the moth delights to lay her  eggs; and which furnished her progeny with a most congenial nourishment,  until they are able to get access to the combs.    21. It should afford facilities for feeding the bees both in warm and  cold weather.    In this respect, my hive has very unusual advantages. Sixty colonies in  warm weather may, in an hour, be fed a quart each, and yet no feeder be  used, and no risk incurred from robbing bees. (See Chapter on Feeding.)    22. It should allow of the easy hiving of a swarm, without injuring any  of the bees, or risking the destruction of the queen. (See Chapter on  Natural Swarming, and Hiving.)    23. It should admit of the safe transportation of the bees to any  distance whatever.    The permanent bottom-board, the firm attachment of the combs, each to a  separate frame, and the facility with which, in my hive, any amount of  air can be given to the bees when shut up, most admirably adapt it to  this purpose.    24. It should furnish the bees with air when the entrance is shut; and  the ventilation for this purpose ought to be unobstructed, even if the  hives should be buried in two or three feet of snow. (See Chapter on  Protection.)    25. A good hive should furnish facilities for enlarging, contracting,  and closing the entrance; so as to protect the bees against robbers, and  the bee-moth; and when the entrance is altered, the bees ought not to  lose valuable time in searching for it, as they must do in most hives.  (See Chapters on Ventilation, and on Robbing.)    26. It should give the bees the means of ventilating their hives,  without enlarging the entrance too much, so as to expose them to moths  and robbers, and to the risk of losing their brood by a chill in sudden  changes of weather. (See Chapter on Ventilation.)    To secure this end, the ventilators must not only be independent of the  entrance, but they must owe their efficiency mainly to the co-operation  of the bees themselves, who thus have a free admission of air only when  they want it. To depend on the opening and shutting of the ventilators  by the bee-keeper, is entirely out of the question.    27. It should furnish facilities for admitting at once, a large body of  air; so that in winter, or early spring, when the weather is at any time  unusually mild, the bees may be tempted to fly out and discharge their  faeces. (See Chapter on Protection.)    If such a free admission of air cannot be given to hives which are  thoroughly protected against the cold, the bees may lose a favorable  opportunity of emptying themselves; and thus be more exposed than they  otherwise would, to suffer from diseases resulting from too long  confinement. A very free admission of air is also desirable when the  weather is exceedingly hot.    28. It should enable the Apiarian to remove the excess of bee-bread from  old stocks.    This article always accumulates in old hives, so that in the course of  time, many of the combs are filled with it, thus unfitting them for the  rearing of brood, and the reception of honey. Young stocks, on the other  hand, will often be so deficient in this important article, that in the  early part of the season, breeding will be seriously interfered with. By  means of my movable frames, the excess of old colonies may be made to  supply the deficiency of young ones, to the mutual benefit of both. (See  Chapter on Pollen.)    29. It should enable the Apiarian, when he has removed the combs from a  common hive, to place them with the bees, brood, honey and bee-bread, in  the improved hive, so that the bees may be able to attach them in their  natural positions. (See directions for transferring bees from an old  hive.)    30. It should allow of the easy and safe dislodgement of the bees from  the hive.    This requisite is especially important to secure the union of colonies,  when it becomes necessary to break up some of the stocks. (See remarks  on the Union of Stocks.)    31. It should allow the heat and odor of the main hive, as well as the  bees themselves, to pass in the freest manner, to the surplus honey  receptacles.    In this respect, all the hives with which I am acquainted, are more or  less deficient: the bees are forced to work in receptacles difficult of  access, and in which, especially in cool nights, they find it impossible  to keep up the animal heat necessary for comb-building. Bees cannot, in  such hives, work to advantage in glass tumblers, or other small vessels.  One of the most important arrangements of my hive, is that by which the  heat ascends into all the receptacles for storing honey, as naturally  and almost as easily as the warmest air ascends to the top of a heated  room.    32. It should permit the surplus honey to be taken away, in the most  convenient, beautiful and salable forms, at any time, and without any  risk of annoyance from the bees.    In my hives, it may be taken in tumblers, glass boxes, wooden boxes  small or large, earthen jars, flower-pots; in short, in any kind of  receptacle which may suit the fancy, or the convenience of the  bee-keeper. Or all these may be dispensed with, and the honey may be  taken from the interior of the main hive, by removing the frames with  loaded combs, and supplying their place with empty ones.    33. It should admit of the easy removal of all the good honey from the  main hive, that its place may be supplied with an inferior article.    Bee-Keepers who have but few colonies, and who wish to secure the  largest yield, may remove the loaded combs from my hive, slice off the  covers of the cells, drain out the honey, and restore the empty combs,  into which, if the season of gathering is over, they can first pour the  cheap foreign honey for the use of the bees.    34. It should allow, when quantity not quality is the object, the  largest amount of honey to be gathered; so that the surplus of strong  colonies may, in the Fall, be given to those which have not a sufficient  supply.    By surmounting my hive with a box of the same dimensions, the combs may  all be transferred to this box, and the bees, when they commence  building, will descend and fill the lower frames, gradually using the  upper box, as the brood is hatched out, for storing honey. In this way,  the largest possible yield of honey may be secured, as the bees always  prefer to continue their work below, rather than above the main hive,  and will never swarm, when allowed in season, ample room in this  direction. The combs in the upper box, containing a large amount of  bee-bread and being of a size adapted to the breeding of workers, will  be all the better for aiding weak colonies.    35. It should compel, when desired, the force of the colony to be mainly  directed to raising young bees; so that brood may be on hand to form new  colonies, and strengthen feeble stocks. (See Chapter on Artificial  Swarming.)    36. It ought, while well protected from the weather, to be so  constructed, that in warm, sunny days in early spring, the influence of  the sun may be allowed to penetrate and warm up the hive, so as to  encourage early breeding. (See Chapter on Protection.)    37. The hive should be equally well adapted to be used as a swarmer, or  non-swarmer.    In my hives bees may be allowed, if their owner chooses, to swarm just  as they do in common hives, and be managed in the usual way. Even on  this plan, the great protection against the weather which it affords,  and the command over all the combs, will be found to afford great  advantages. (See Natural Swarming.)    Non-swarming hives managed in the ordinary way are liable, in spite of  all precautions, to swarm very unexpectedly, and if not closely watched,  the swarm is lost, and with it the profit of that season. By having the  command of the combs, the queen in my hives can always be caught and  deprived of her wings; thus she cannot go off with a swarm, and they  will not leave without her.    38. It should enable the Apiarian, if he allows his bees to swarm, and  wishes to secure surplus honey, to prevent them from throwing more than  one swarm in a season.    Second and third swarms must be returned to the old stock, if the  largest quantities of surplus honey are to be realized. It is  troublesome to watch them, deprive them of their queens, and restore  them to the parent hive. They often issue with new queens again and  again; and waste, in this way, both their own time, and that of their  keeper. \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" In my hives,  as soon as the first swarm has issued, and been hived, all the queen  cells except one, in the hive from which it came, may be cut out, and  thus all after-swarming will very easily and effectually be prevented.  (See Chapter on Artificial Swarming, for the use to which these  supernumerary queens may be put.) When the old stock is left with but  one queen, she runs no risk of being killed or crippled in a contest  with rivals. By such contests, a colony is often left without a queen,  or in possession of one which is too much maimed to be of any service.  (See Chapter on the Loss of the Queen.)    39. A good hive should enable the Apiarian, if he relies on natural  swarming, and wishes to multiply his colonies as fast as possible, to  make vigorous stocks of all his small after-swarms.    Such swarms contain a young queen, and if they can be judiciously  strengthened, usually make the best stock hives. If hived in a common  hive, and left to themselves, unless very early, or in very favorable  seasons, they seldom thrive. They generally desert their hives, or  perish in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24586"],[0,"The Story of My Life (#18)"],[1,"Indians have been intoxicated;       and one of them, in a fit of anguish, shot himself! This was caused       by a wicked white man, who persuaded them to drink cider in which       he mixed whiskey. [See letter below.]         _Sept. 24th.--Sabbath._--I tried to improve the mournful       circumstance that occurred yesterday, as the Indians seemed much       affected on account of the awful death of their brother.         _Sept. 25th._--We have resolved upon building a house, which is to       answer the double purpose of a school-house, and a place for divine       worship. In less than an hour these poor Indians subscribed one       hundred dollars, forty of which was paid at once. What a contrast,       a short time ago they would sell the last thing they had for       whiskey; now they economize to save something to build a Temple for       the true God!         _Sept. 26th._--To-day I buried two Indians, one the man who       committed suicide, the other a new-born babe.         _Oct. 8th._--For many days I have been employed in an unpleasant       controversy, for our civil and religious rights, which has taken       much of my time and attention.         _Oct. 9th._--One of my brethren has been suddenly called from his       labours, to his eternal home. Alas! my beloved Edward Hyland is no       more. He entered the field after me, but he has gone before me!         _Oct. 14th._--I have been employed the whole week in raising       subscriptions for the Indian Church; we have now enough subscribed.    _Oct. 19th._--[In a letter, to-day, to his brother George, who wished to  hear something about the Indian work, Dr. Ryerson said: I have to  attend to various things previous to settling myself permanently at the  Credit. I preached there to the Indians the two succeeding Sabbaths  after I left home, and have been employed since that time in building a  chapel for them at the Credit. The Indians in general, appear to be  steadfast in their religious profession. They are faithful in their  religious duties, and exemplary in their lives. One unhappy circumstance  occurred there. [See entry in Diary of 23rd September.] I preached a  solemn discourse on the subject of guarding against temptation and  intemperance the same day, illustrating it throughout by this lamentable  example. The Indians appeared to be much affected; and, I think, through  the mercy of God, it has, and will prove a salutary warning to them. The  Indians were very spirited in building their chapel. They made up more  than a hundred dollars towards it, and are willing to do more, if  necessary. By going in different parts of the country, I have got about  enough subscribed and paid to finish it. I have now permanently resided  at the Credit Mission not quite a fortnight. I board with John Jones;  have a bed-room, but no fire-place, except what is used by the family. I  can speak a little Mississauga, and understand it pretty well. As to my  enjoyments in religion, I have lately had the severest conflicts I ever  experienced; but at times the rich consolations of religion have flowed  sweetly to my heart and God has abundantly blessed me, especially in my  pulpit ministrations. It is the language of my heart to my blessed  Saviour, Thy will, not mine, be done. Our prospects in little York are  favourable. The chapel is enlarged, and the congregation greatly  increased, some having lately joined.--H.]         _Nov. 9th._--This evening in visiting a sick Indian man, I       endeavoured, through an interpreter, to explain to him the causes       of our afflictions, the sympathy of Jesus, and the use of them to       Christians. We afterwards had prayer, many flocked into the room.       The sick man was filled with peace in believing, insomuch that he       clapped his hands for joy.         [Illustration: John Jones' House at the Credit, where Dr. Ryerson       resided.]         _Nov. 26th.--Sabbath._--This has been an important day. We opened       our Indian Chapel by holding a love-feast, and celebrating the       Lord's supper. The Indians with much solemnity and feeling       expressed what God had done for them. Rev. Wm. Case addressed them.       In the evening he gave them most important instruction, as to       domestic economy and Christian duties. After this a short time was       spent in teaching them the Ten Commandments, the Indian speaker       repeating them audibly sentence by sentence, which was responded to       by the whole congregation. At the close, eight persons, seven       adults and one infant were baptized. Three years ago they were       without suitable clothes, home, morality, or God. Now they are       decently clothed, sheltered from the storm by comfortable       dwellings, and many of them rejoicing in the hope of a glorious       immortality.         _Nov. 29th._--Last evening, in addressing a few of the Indians, who       were collected on account of the death of one of them, (John       Muskrat) I felt a degree of light spring up in my mind. This Indian       was converted about a year ago, and has ever since maintained a       godly walk and holy conversation. Thus missionary labour has not       been in vain. This is the third that has left an encouraging       testimony behind of a glorious resurrection.         _Nov. 30th._--I have this day divided the Indian society into       classes, selected a leader for each, from the most pious and       intelligent. I meet these leaders once a week separately, to       instruct them in their duty.         _Dec. 7th._--I have been often quite unwell, owing to change of       living, being out at night; my fare, as to food _is very plain_,       but wholesome, and I generally lie on boards with one or two       blankets intervening.[10]         _Dec. 8th._--I am feeling encouraged in the prosecution of the       Indian language, and in the spirit of my mission. There is a       tenderness in the disposition of many of the Indians, especially of       the women, which endears them to the admirers of natural       excellence. One of them kindly presented me with a handsome basket,       which is designed to keep my books in. This afternoon I collected       about a dozen of the boys, to go with me to the woods, in order to       cut and carry wood for the chapel. Their exertions and activity       were astonishing.         _Dec. 16th._--I have this week been trying to procure for the       Indians the exclusive right of their salmon fishery, which I trust       will be granted by the Legislature.[11] I have attended one of       their Councils, when everything was conducted in the most orderly       manner. After all the business was adjusted, they wished to give me       an Indian name. The old Chief arose, and approached the table where       I was sitting, and in his own tongue addressed me in the following       manner: \"Brother, as we are brothers, we will give you a name. My       departed brother was named Cheehock; thou shalt be called       Cheehock.\"[12] I returned him thanks in his own tongue, and so       became initiated among them.         _Dec. 22nd._--My brother John, writing from Grimsby, thus       acknowledges the kind advice of brother George: I thank you for       your kind advice, and I can assure you I have felt of late, more       than ever, the importance of preaching Christ, and Christ alone. It       is my aim and constant prayer to live in that way, so that I can       always adopt the language of the Apostle, Romans xiv. 7, 8. I wish       you to write as often as convenient. Any advice or instruction that       you may have at any time to give, will be thankfully received.         _January 4th, 1827._--After the absence of more than a week, I       again return to my Indians, who welcome me with the tenderest marks       of kindness. Watch-night on New Year's Eve was a season of great       rejoicing among them. About 12 o'clock, while their speaker was       addressing them, the glory of the Lord filled the house, and about       twenty fell to the floor. They all expressed a determination to       commence the New Year with fresh zeal. My soul was abundantly       blessed at the commencement of the year, while speaking at the       close of the Watchnight services in York.         My engagement in controversial writing savours too much of dry       historical criticism to be spiritual, and often causes leanness of       soul; but it seems to be necessary in the present state of matters       in this Colony, and it is the opinion of my most judicious friends,       that I should continue it till it comes to a successful       termination.    _Jan. 10th._--[Having received a letter of enquiry from his brother  George, Dr. Ryerson replied at this date, and said:--    I have been unwell for nearly two months with a continuance of violent  colds, occasioned by frequent changes from a cold house and a  thinly-clad bed at the Credit, to warm rooms in York. My indisposition  of body has generally induced a depression of spirits, which has often  unfitted me for a proper discharge of duties, or proficiency in study.  However, in the midst of bodily indisposition, the blessings of the Holy  Spirit have been at times abundantly poured into my soul, insomuch that  I could glory in tribulation, and rejoice that I am counted worthy to  labour and suffer among the most unprofitable and worthless of the  labourers in my Saviour's vineyard. The Indians are firm in their  Christian profession, and some of them are making considerable  improvement in the knowledge of doctrine and duties of religion, and of  things in general. They are affectionate and tractable.    I am very unpleasantly situated at the Credit, during the cold weather,  as there are nearly a dozen in the family, and only one fire-place. I  have lived at different houses among the Indians, and thereby learned  some of their wants, and the proper remedies for them. Having no"]]]
