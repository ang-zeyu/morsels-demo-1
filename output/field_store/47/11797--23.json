Lee (#18)"],[1,"great men year by year is made plainer to the  world, their love, trust, and respect for each other will be better  understood. As commander and lieutenant they were exactly suited. When  General Lee wanted a movement made and gave Jackson an outline of his  plans and the object to be gained, it was performed promptly, well, and  thoroughly, if it was possible for flesh and blood to do it.    At the end of May, the Army of Northern Virginia, rested and  strengthened, was ready for active operations. On May 31st General Lee  writes to Mrs. Lee:    \"...General Hooker has been very daring this past week, and quite  active. He has not said what he intends to do, but is giving out by his  movements that he designs crossing the Rappahannock. I hope we may be  able to frustrate his plans, in part, if not in whole.... I pray that  our merciful Father in Heaven may protect and direct us! In that case, I  fear no odds and no numbers.\"    About June 5th most of the army was gathered around Culpeper. Its  efficiency, confidence, and MORALE were never better. On June 7th the  entire cavalry corps was reviewed on the plain near Brandy Station in  Culpeper by General Lee. We had been preparing ourselves for this event  for some days, cleaning, mending and polishing, and I remember were  very proud of our appearance. In fact, it was a grand sight--about  eight thousand well-mounted men riding by their beloved commander, first  passing by him in a walk and then a trot. He writes to my mother next  day--June 8, 1863:    \"...I reviewed the cavalry in this section yesterday. It was a splendid  sight. The men and horses looked well. They have recuperated since last  fall. Stuart [J. E. B. Stuart, commanding cavalry corps.] was in all his  glory. Your sons and nephews [two sons and three nephews] were well  and flourishing. The country here looks very green and pretty,  notwithstanding the ravages of war. What a beautiful world God, in His  loving kindness to His creatures, has given us! What a shame that men  endowed with reason and knowledge of right should mar His gifts....\"    The next day, June 9th, a large force of the enemy's cavalry, supported  by infantry, crossed the Rappahannock and attacked General Stuart. The  conflict lasted until dark, when \"The enemy was compelled to recross the  river, with heavy loss, leaving about five hundred prisoners, three  pieces of artillery, and several colours in our hands.\"    During the engagement, about 3 P. M., my brother, General W. H. F. Lee,  my commanding officer, was severely wounded. In a letter dated the 11th  of the month, my father writes to my mother:    \"...My supplications continue to ascend for you, my children, and my  country. When I last wrote I did not suppose that Fitzhugh would be soon  sent to the rear disabled, and I hope it will be for a short time. I  saw him the night after the battle--indeed, met him on the field as they  were bringing him from the front. He is young and healthy, and I trust  will soon be up again. He seemed to be more concerned about his brave  men and officers, who had fallen in the battle, than about himself....\"    It was decided, the next day, to send my brother to \"Hickory Hill,\" the  home of Mr. W. F. Wickham, in Hanover County, about twenty miles from  Richmond, and I was put in charge of him to take him there and to be  with him until his wound should heal. Thus it happened that I did not  meet my father again until after Gettysburg had been fought, and the  army had recrossed into Virginia, almost to the same place I had left  it. My father wrote my brother a note the morning after he was wounded,  before he left Culpeper. It shows his consideration and tenderness:    \"My Dear Son: I send you a dispatch, received from C. last night. I hope  you are comfortable this morning. I wish I could see you, but I cannot.  Take care of yourself, and make haste and get well and return. Though I  scarcely ever saw you, it was a great comfort to know that you were near  and with me. I could think of you and hope to see you. May we yet meet  in peace and happiness....\"    In a letter to my brother's wife, written on the 11th, his love and  concern for both of them are plainly shown:    \"I am so grieved, my dear daughter, to send Fitzhugh to you wounded. But  I am so grateful that his wound is of a character to give us full hope  of a speedy recovery. With his youth and strength to aid him, and your  tender care to nurse him, I trust he will soon be well again. I know  that you will unite with me in thanks to Almighty God, who has so often  sheltered him in the hour of danger, for his recent deliverance, and  lift up your whole heart in praise to Him for sparing a life so dear  to us, while enabling him to do his duty in the station in which he had  placed him. Ask him to join us in supplication that He may always cover  him with the shadow of His almighty arm, and teach him that his only  refuge is in Him, the greatness of whose mercy reacheth unto the  heavens, and His truth unto the clouds. As some good is always mixed  with the evil in this world, you will now have him with you for a time,  and I shall look to you to cure him soon and send him back to me....\"    My brother reached \"Hickory Hill\" quite comfortably, and his wound  commenced to heal finely. His wife joined him, my mother and sisters  came up from Richmond, and he had all the tender care he could wish. He  occupied \"the office\" in the yard, while I slept in the room adjoining  and became quite an expert nurse. About two weeks after our arrival,  one lovely morning as we all came out from the breakfast table, stepping  into the front porch with Mrs. Wickham, we were much surprised to hear  to or three shots down in the direction of the outer gate, where there  was a large grove of hickory trees. Mrs. Wickham said some one must be  after her squirrels, as there were many in those woods and she asked  me to run down and stop whoever was shooting them. I got my hat, and at  once started off to do her bidding. I had not gone over a hundred yards  toward the grove, when I saw, coming up at a gallop to the gate I was  making for, five or six Federal cavalrymen. I knew what it meant at  once, so I rushed back to the office and told my brother. He immediately  understood the situation and directed me to get away--said I could do no  good by staying, that the soldiers could not and would not hurt him, and  there was nothing to be gained by my falling into their hands; but that,  on the contrary, I might do a great deal of good by eluding them, making  my way to \"North Wales,\" a plantation across the Pamunkey River, and  saving our horses.    So I ran out, got over the fence and behind a thick hedge, just as I  heard the tramp and clank of quite a body of troopers riding up. Behind  this hedge I crept along until I reached a body of woods, were I was  perfectly safe. From a hill near by I ascertained that there was a large  raiding party of Federal cavalry in the main road, and the heavy smoke  ascending from the Court House, about three miles away, told me that  they were burning the railroad buildings at that place. After waiting  until I thought the coast was clear, I worked my way very cautiously  back to the vicinity of the house to find out what was going on.  Fortunately, I took advantage of the luxuriant shrubbery in the old  garden at the rear of the house, and when I looked out from the last  box bush that screened me, about twenty yards from the back porch, I  perceived that I was too soon, for there were standing, sitting and  walking about quite a number of the bluecoats. I jumped back behind the  group of box trees, and, flinging myself flat under a thick fir, crawled  close up to the trunk under the low-hanging branches, and lay there for  some hours.    I saw my brother brought out from the office on a mattress, and placed  in the \"Hickory Hill\" carriage, to which was hitched Mr. Wichkam's  horses, and then saw him driven away, a soldier on the box and a mounted  guard surrounding him. He was carried to the \"White House\" in this way,  and then sent by water to Fortress Monroe. This party had been sent out  especially to capture him, and he was held as a hostage (for the safety  of some Federal officers we had captured) for nine long, weary months.    The next day I found out that all the horses but one had been saved by  the faithfulness of our servants. The one lost, my brother's favourite  and best horse, was ridden straight into the column by Scott, a negro  servant, who had him out for exercise. Before he knew our enemies, he  and the horse were prisoners. Scott watched for his opportunity, and,  not being guarded, soon got away. By crawling through a culvert, under  the road, while the cavalry was passing along, he made his way into a  deep ditch in the adjoining field, thence succeeded in reaching the farm  where the rest of the horses were, and hurried them off to a safe place  in the woods, just as the Federal cavalry rode up to get them.    In a letter dated Culpeper, July 26th, to my brother's wife, my father  thus urges resignation:    \"I received, last night, my darling daughter, your letter of the 18th  from 'Hickory Hill.'... You must not be sick while Fitzhugh is away, or  he will be more restless under his separation. Get strong and hearty by  his return, that he may the more rejoice at the sight of you.... I can  appreciate your distress at Fitzhugh's situation. I deeply sympathise  with it, and in the lone hours of the night I groan in sorrow at his  captivity and separation from you. But we must bear it, exercise all our  patience, and do nothing to aggravate the evil. This, besides injuring  ourselves, would rejoice our enemies and be sinful in the eyes of  God. In His own good time He will relieve us and make all things work  together for our good, if we give Him our love and place in Him our  trust.

The eye is set after the fish is dry and if it does not fill the socket,  model around it with wax or paper pulp. Fish eyes vary so greatly that  to strictly copy nature you had better use the uncolored fish eyes,  painting the back with suitable oil colors with a coat or two of shellac  over it to prevent the clay in which it is set from affecting the paint.  The final painting of a mounted fish which is necessary to complete the  best work is a task for an artist. If a specimen in the flesh (living if  possible) is at hand this is made easier. All fish skins collected  should be accompanied by color sketches if possible.    All silvery fish should be coated with size and nickel leaf over their  entire scaly surface. On this ground paint with thin oil colors. If the  paint is not too thick the desired silvery sheen will show through. If  the whole fish is dark no leaf is needed and in some cases the upper  part of the body requires a gold ground with the nickel leaf on the  silvery under parts. Japanese gold paint or something similar will do  for a golden ground.    The finished medallion may lie flat in a case, be fastened on the face  of a panel, or hung by a loop at the mouth or center of back. Panels of  natural wood are a favorite mount and framed panels covered with plush  or the imitation pebbled upholstery leather.    Another method of mounting medallions is to take a plaster mold of the  display half of the fish and from it make a plaster cast like the back  board. This is sandpapered down to allow for the skin and gouged out at  the bases of the fins and tail. The head too is not reproduced on the  cast.    [Illustration: MEDALLION FISH, PAPER BACKING, BOARD BACK, EXCELSIOR  BETWEEN.]    When the skin is ready to apply, coat this plaster cast with some  nonporous modelling material. A mixture of thin liquid glue and whiting  is good for this. Some paper pulp is put inside the head and at the  junction of body and fins. Shape from the outside with the fingers.    A piece of wood should have been placed in the back of the plaster cast  when making same, in order to fasten to a panel by screws from the back.  Paint the wood with melted paraffin before putting in the wet plaster or  it may swell and subsequently shrink enough to crack the cast. By either  of the preceding methods the entire fish can be mounted if desired.    The opening cut should be made from head to tail along the lower edge of  the body in most scale fish and will require some neat modelling to hide  as both sides are to be on exhibition.    Entire fish are usually supported by metal standards rising from a  wooden base. Such standards are preferably of brass, threaded and fitted  with nuts and rosettes at both ends. Two nuts at the lower end clamp the  base and with the upper end inserted in the back board, the upper nut  will adjust the fish at the right heighth. The rosettes cover the nuts  and add a finished appearance.    Especially adapted to tarpon and other ponderous fish are medallions  mounted on paper. To do this a half mould is made as described, the skin  removed, cleaned, poisoned and replaced in the mould. Then it is backed  up with numerous layers of soft paper, well pasted and pressed in with  the hands. Let these layers of paper overlap the mould at least as much  as the margin of skin left on the back.    When a sufficient thickness is attained fill the hollow form loosely  with crumpled paper or excelsior and fit in place a back board of light  wood. Nail through the margin of skin and paper into the edges of this.  If a number of large holes were made in the back board it will expedite  the drying out.    When partly dry, remove from the mould, painting and finishing as before  when completely dry. By this means the contour of large fish is  absolutely reproduced and the finished work is extremely light and  durable.    Many of the smooth skinned fishes are impossible to mount  satisfactorily, a cast is the best we can do for them.    When using a living fish as a guide in painting, it may be confined in  an aquarium and by sliding a wire screen partition, be kept just before  the artist's eye.          CHAPTER XXI.    MOUNTING FISH--BAUMGARTEL METHOD.      Some years ago A Practical Method of Fish Mounting was advertised by Mr.  Baumgartel in Angling and Sporting publications. Entire satisfaction was  given to those who studied and applied the lessons, through  correspondence school methods. Both the author and publisher of HOME  TAXIDERMY FOR PLEASURE AND PROFIT, are indeed glad to publish the entire  course as used by Mr. Baumgartel, including diagrams, figures, etc., as  same together with copyright was conveyed to A. R. Harding.    The same degree of excellence in mounting fish has not been so generally  attained as in other branches of the taxidermy art, and this I believe  is because an equal amount of study has not been given the subject.  Hundreds can mount birds well to one who can prepare fish in as skillful  a manner, although the mounting of fish dates from as early a period in  the art of taxidermy. It is a question of method and the right one.    The usual methods of mounting fish have proven so unsatisfactory that  they have been almost entirely abandoned, and, until the method to be  described was devised, it was necessary to place specimens in alcohol or  other preserving liquids or to make plaster casts of them. The  objections to the former process are that it is expensive, requiring  especially constructed jars to show the specimens without distortion.  They usually lose all their natural colors, and in most cases shrink to  such an extent as to give only an approximate idea of their original  form. There are also serious objections to the latter method. Plaster  casts are easily broken and certain parts, such as the interior of the  mouth, cannot readily be produced. Further, it is not desirable in  natural history collections to exhibit casts of the objects when the  originals can be displayed. Then, too, the sportsman does not care for a  cast of his \"Big Fish,\" but wants the real thing to verify history of  the one that didn't get away. To me a plaster cast of an object that can  itself be preserved is about as interesting as a nicely painted decoy  duck compares with a well-mounted skin.    As is the case with nearly every taxidermist, professional as well as  amateur, I have always been an enthusiastic sportsman. The desire to  preserve the specimens taken by me led me to devote myself to the study  of taxidermy. Perhaps the dilatoriness of the \"artist\" who mounted my  first specimens had a stimulating effect. Later, as a professional  taxidermist, I for many years mounted fish by means of the various  methods, but the results obtained were not satisfactory to me.    In 1903 Mrs. Baumgartel and I made a trip to Pine River, Michigan, for  trout. It was in June. The weather turned cold, and we took few fish. On  the twelfth I made what was to be my last cast, had taken down my rod  and was walking along the bank of the river on my way to camp, when at  the edge of a pool I noticed a fish jumping. I could not resist the  temptation to try one more cast, and making preparations I dropped a  Parmachene Belle a few inches from the spot where the fish had just  broken the water. There was a rise, a strike, and I was fast to a fish  destined to be mine. After an exciting struggle, I landed a  thirteen-inch grayling weighing one pound and two ounces. Of course,  this fish I had to preserve and wanted it to look as it did when taken  from the net. We boarded the train for home that evening, and supplying  my wife with reading matter, I was soon lost in meditation. The madam  told me many times during the journey home that I was not at all  companionable. Be that as it may, the result of the earnest study given  the matter, and the previous experience gained in experimenting with  other processes, was that a practical method of mounting fish was  devised, a method by means of which the angler can successfully mount  his own specimens. \"Necessity is the mother of invention,\" you know.    A picture of this grayling is given below. It still occupies a position  in our dining room, together with others to remind us of pleasant days  on lake and stream. It is mounted with the very fly and leader on which  it was taken.    [Illustration: GRAYLING--RESULT OF MY FIRST EXPERIENCE AT FISH  MOUNTING.]    For the past four years I have successfully taught my method by  correspondence. A few years ago activities in other directions compelled  me to give up taxidermy work, and other interests now demanding more of  my personal attention, the publisher of this book, always on the alert  for something of practical value to interest his readers, will present  to you in these pages the identical instructions I have so successfully  used. I take the liberty of quoting verbatim from a letter just received  by me from a friend of a prominent eastern professional man, one who,  while \"chained to business,\" still finds time to get \"close to nature\"  for a season each year:    \"Referring to the fish mounted on our Newfoundland trip: I may say that  it was our first experience and we were agreeably surprised at results.  In all there were ten specimens of salmon, sea-trout and brook-trout  mounted and we found no great difficulties. All the work was  accomplished in an old barn after we got home evenings and early  mornings before going out. The only obstacle we encountered was getting  the fish back to the states in good shape. Five of the specimens now  occupy prominent place in the Doctor's den and I am always pleased to  point out to friends the results of our labors.\"    You can do as well.    INSTRUMENTS.
