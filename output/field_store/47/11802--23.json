But how many other  animals have these crude naturalists omitted to describe?  We may safely  assert that the raccoon exists in South America, as well in the tropical  forests of Guyana as in the colder regions of the Table Land--everywhere  that there exists tree-timber.  In most parts where the Spanish language  is spoken, it is known as the \"_zorro negro_,\" or black fox.  Indeed,  there are two species in South America, the common one (_Procyon  lotor_), and the crab-eater (_Procyon cancrivorus_).    In North America it is one of the most common of wild animals.  In all  parts you may meet with it.  In the hot lowlands of Louisiana--in the  tropical \"chapparals\" of Mexico--in the snowy regions of Canada--and in  the vernal valleys of California.  Unlike the deer, the wild cat, and  the wolverine, it is never mistaken for any other animal, nor is any  animal taken for it.  It is as well-known in America as the red fox is  in England, and with a somewhat similar reputation.    Although there is a variety in colour and size, there is no ambiguity  about species or genus.  Wherever the English language is spoken, it has  but one name, the \"raccoon.\"  In America, every man, woman and child  knows the \"sly ole 'coon.\"    This animal has been placed by naturalists in the family _Ursidae_,  genus _Procyon_.  Linnaeus made it a _bear_, and classed it with  _Ursus_.  It has, in our opinion, but little in common with the bear,  and far more resembles the fox.  Hence the Spanish name of \"_zorro  negro_\" (black fox).    A writer quaintly describes it thus:--\"The limbs of a bear, the body of  a badger, the head of a fox, the nose of a dog, the tail of a cat, and  sharp claws, by which it climbs trees like a monkey.\"  We cannot admit  the similarity of its tail to that of a cat.  The tail of the raccoon is  full and bushy, which is not true of the cat's tail.  There is only a  similarity in the annulated or banded appearance noticed in the tails of  some cats, which in that of the raccoon is a marked characteristic.    The raccoon, to speak in round terms, is about the size of an English  fox, but somewhat thicker and \"bunchier\" in the body.  Its legs are  short in proportion, and as it is _plantigrade_ in the hind-feet, it  stands and runs low, and cat-like.  The muzzle is extremely pointed and  slender, adapted to its habit of prying into every chink and corner, in  search of spiders, beetles, and other creatures.    The general colour of the raccoon is dark brown (nearly black) on the  upper part of the body, mixed with iron-grey.  Underneath it is of a  lighter hue.  There is, here and there, a little fawn colour intermixed.  A broad black band runs across the eyes and unites under the throat.  This band is surrounded and sharply defined with a margin of  greyish-white, which gives a unique expression to the \"countenance\" of  the \"'coon.\"    One of the chief beauties of this animal is its tail, which is  characteristic in its markings.  It exhibits twelve annulations or  ring-bands, six black and six greyish-white, in regular alternation.  The tip is black, and the tail itself is very full or \"bushy.\"  When the  'coon-skin is made into a cap--which it often is among hunters and  frontiers-men--the tail is left to hang as a drooping plume; and such a  head-dress is far from ungraceful.  In some \"settlements\" the 'coon-skin  cap is quite the fashion among the young \"backwoodsmen.\"    The raccoon is an animal of an extremely amorous disposition; but there  is a fact connected with the sex of this creature which is curious: the  female is larger than the male.  Not only larger, but in every respect a  finer-looking animal.  The hair, long on both, is more full and glossy  upon the female, its tints deeper and more beautiful.  This is contrary  to the general order of nature.  By those unacquainted with this fact,  the female is mistaken for the male, and _vice versa_, as in the case of  hawks and eagles.    The fur of the raccoon has long been an article of commerce, as it is  used in making beaver hats; but as these have given place in most  countries to the silk article, the 'coon-skin now commands but a small  price.    The raccoon is a tree-climber of the first quality.  It climbs with its  sharp-curved claws, not by hugging, as is the case with the bear tribe.  Its lair, or place of retreat, is in a tree--some hollow, with its  entrance high up.  Such trees are common in the great primeval forests  of America.  In this tree-cave it has its nest, where the female brings  forth three, four, five, or six \"cubs\" at a birth.  This takes place in  early spring--usually the first week in April.    The raccoon is a creature of the woods.  On the prairies and in treeless  regions it is not known.  It prefers heavy \"timber,\" where there are  huge logs and hollow trees in plenty.  It requires the neighbourhood of  water, and in connection with this may be mentioned a curious habit it  has, that of plunging all its food into the water before devouring it.  It will be remembered that the otter has a similar habit.  It is from  this peculiarity that the raccoon derives its specific name of _Lotor_  (washer).  It does not always moisten its morsel thus, but pretty  generally.  It is fond, moreover, of frequent ablutions, and no animal  is more clean and tidy in its habits.    The raccoon is almost omnivorous.  It eats poultry or wild fowls.  It  devours frogs, lizards, lame, and insects without distinction.  It is  fond of sweets, and is very destructive to the sugar-cane and Indian  corn of the planter.  When the ear of the maize is young, or, as it is  termed, \"in the milk,\" it is very sweet.  Then the raccoon loves to prey  upon it.  Whole troops at night visit the corn-fields and commit  extensive havoc.  These mischievous habits make the creature many  enemies, and in fact it has but few friends.  It kills hares, rabbits,  and squirrels when it can catch them, and will rob a bird's nest in the  most ruthless manner.  It is particularly fond of shell-fish; and the  _unios_, with which many of the fresh-water lakes and rivers of America  abound, form part of its food.  These it opens as adroitly with its  claws as an oyster-man could with his knife.  It is partial to the  \"soft-shell\" crabs and small tortoises common in the American waters.    Jake told us of a trick which the 'coon puts in practice for catching  the small turtles of the creek.  We were not inclined to give credence  to the story, but Jake almost swore to it.  It is certainly curious if  true, but it smacks very much of Buffon.  It may be remarked, however,  that the knowledge which the plantation negroes have of the habits of  the raccoon surpasses that of any mere naturalist.  Jake boldly declares  that the 'coon fishes for turtles! that it squats upon the bank of the  stream, allowing its bushy tail to hang over into the water; that the  turtles swimming about in search of food or amusement, spies the hairy  appendage and lays hold of it; and that the 'coon, feeling the nibble,  suddenly draws the testaceous swimmer upon dry land, and then \"cleans  out de shell\" at his leisure!    The 'coon is often domesticated in America.  It is harmless as a dog or  cat except when crossed by children, when it will snarl, snap, and bite  like the most crabbed cur.  It is troublesome, however, where poultry is  kept, and this prevents its being much of a favourite.  Indeed, it is  not one, for it is hunted everywhere, and killed--wherever this can be  done--on sight.    There is a curious connection between the negro and the raccoon.  It is  not a tie of sympathy, but a kind of antagonism.  The 'coon, as already  observed, is the negro's legitimate game.  'Coon-hunting is peculiarly a  negro sport.  The negro is the 'coon's mortal enemy.  He kills the 'coon  when and wherever he can, and cats it too.  He loves its \"meat,\" which  is pork-tasted, and in young 'coons palatable enough, but in old ones  rather rank.  This, however, our \"darkie\" friend does not much mind,  particularly if his master be a \"stingy old boss,\" and keeps him on rice  instead of meat rations.  The negro, moreover, makes an odd \"bit\"  (twelve and a half cents) by the skin, which he disposes of to the  neighbouring \"storekeeper.\"    The 'coon-hunt is a \"nocturnal\" sport, and therefore does not interfere  with the negro's regular labour.  By right the night belongs to him, and  he may then dispose of his time as he pleases, which he often does in  this very way.    The negro is not, allowed to carry fire-arms, and for this reason the  squirrel may perch upon a high limb, jerk its tail about and defy him;  the hare may run swiftly away, and the wild turkey may tantalise him  with its incessant \"gobbling.\"  But the 'coon can be killed without  fire-arms.  The 'coon can be overtaken and \"treed.\"  The negro is not  denied the use of an axe, and no man knows better how to handle it than  he.  The 'coon, therefore, is his natural game, and much sport does he  have in its pursuit.  Nearly the same may be said of the opossum  (_Didelphis Virginiana_); but the \"'possum\" is more rare, and it is not  our intention now to describe that very curious creature.  From both  'coon and 'possum does the poor negro derive infinite sport--many a  sweet excitement that cheers his long winter nights, and chequers with  brighter spots the dull and darksome monotony of his slave-life.  I have  often thought what a pity it would be if the 'coon and the opossum  should be extirpated before slavery itself became extinct.  I had often  shared in this peculiar sport of the negro, and joined in a real  'coon-chase, but the most exciting of all was the first in which I had  been engaged, and I proffered my comrades an account of it.        CHAPTER THIRTEEN.    A 'COON-CHASE.    \"My 'coon-chase took place in Tennessee, where I was sojourning for some  time upon a plantation."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23519"],[0,"The Mormon Menace: The Confessions of John Doyle Lee, Danite (#18)"],[1,"with two young women. They informed me that there was no minister  in the neighborhood; also that their father had gone in pursuit  of a Mormon preacher who had passed that way a few days before. A  few days passed, and I saw myself in the midst of a congregation,  to whom I was preaching. I also baptized a large number and  organized a flourishing branch of the Church, and was in charge  of that people. I was very popular with, and almost worshiped by,  my congregation. I saw all this, and much more, when my vision  closed. My mind gradually changed back, and I found myself  sitting in the meetinghouse, where I had been just forty minutes  before.    This was an open-day vision, in which the curtains of heaven were  raised and held aside from futurity to allow me to look into the  things which were to come. A feeling of heavenly rapture filled  my being, so much so that, like the apostle who was caught up  into the third heaven, I did not know whether I was in the body  or out of it during my vision. I saw things that it would be  unlawful for men to utter. While the vision lasted my soul was  lighted up as if illuminated with the candle of God. When the  vision closed the hallowed influence gradually withdrew, yet  leaving sufficient of its glorious effect upon my soul to justify  me in feeling and knowing that I was then chosen of God as a  servant in His earthly kingdom; and I was also made to know, by  my sensations, that my vision was real, and would soon be  verified in every particular.    At the close of the church services we returned to our lodgings.  Brother Stewart asked me if I was sick. I said:    \"No, I am not sick, but I feel serious; yet I am comfortable.\"    That evening, after I had given some time to secret prayer, I  retired to rest. Very soon afterwards the vision returned, though  somewhat varied. I was in the midst of a strange people, to whom  I was propounding the gospel. They received it with honest  hearts, and looked upon me as a messenger of salvation. I visited  from house to house, surrounded by friends and kindred spirits  with whom I had once been familiar in another state of existence.  I was in the spirit, and communing with the host of spirits that  surrounded me; they encouraged me to return to the body and  continue to act the part that my Master had assigned me. No  person, except those who have entered by pureness of heart into  constant communion with God, can ever enter into the joyous host  with whom I then, and in after life, held intercourse.    When I came to myself in the morning I determined to travel until  the end of time to find the people and country that God had shown  me in my vision; and I made my arrangements to start forth again,  knowing that God now went with me. I started off after having a  talk with Brother Stewart. He tried to dissuade me from going,  saying I had little experience, not sufficient to warrant my  traveling alone; that we had better remain together where we  were for a season, for we had a home there, and could study and  inform ourselves more thoroughly before starting out among  strangers. I told him that in and of my own strength I was but a  weak vessel; but my trust was in God, and unless He would bless  my labors I could not accomplish much. That I was God's servant,  engaged in His work, therefore I looked to Him for strength and  grace sufficient to sustain me in my day of trial. That I trusted  in the arm of God alone, and not in one of flesh. I started off  in a southwesterly course, over the Cumberland Mountains, and  went about seventy miles through a heavily timbered country. I  found many species of wild fruit in abundance along the way.    Springs of pure, cold water were quite common. I passed many  little farms and orchards of cultivated fruit, such as cherries,  peaches, pears, and apples. As I proceeded the country became  familiar to me, so much so that I soon knew I was on the very  ground I had seen in my vision in the Baptist church. I saw the  place where I had held my first meeting, and my joy was great to  behold with my eyes what I had seen through a glass darkly. I  turned aside from the road, and beneath the spreading branches of  the forest trees I lifted my heart with gratitude to God for what  He had done for me. I then went to the house where I had seen the  multitude assembled when I was preaching.    There I saw the two young women that I had beheld in my vision.  They appeared to me as though I had known them from infancy, they  so perfectly accorded with those whom I had seen while God  permitted me to peer into futurity. Yes, I saw the women, but  their father was gone from home. I asked for a drink of water,  and it was handed to me, as I had seen it done in my vision. I  asked them if there had ever been any Mormon preachers in that  country. They said there had not been any there. The young women  were modest and genteel in behavior. I passed on to the  Cumberland River, was set over the river by the ferryman, and  lodged in his house.    So far all was as God had shown me; but I was still at the outer  edge of my familiar scenery. I stayed about a week with the  ferryman. His name was Vanleven, a relative of my friend and  banker in Illinois. I made myself useful while there. I attended  the ferry and did such work as I could see needed attending to. I  also read and preached Mormon doctrines to the family.    On the fifth day after reaching the ferry I saw five men  approaching. I instantly recognized one of them as the man I had  seen in my vision - the man that took me to his house to preach.  My heart leaped for joy, for God had sent him in answer to the  prayers I had offered up, asking that the man should be sent for  me. I crossed the men over and back again, and although I talked  considerably to the man about what was uppermost in my mind, he  said nothing about my going home with him. I was much disappointed.  I retired for secret prayer, and asked God, in the name of His  Son, Jesus Christ, to aid me, and to send the man whom I had seen  in my vision back for me. Before I left my knees I had evidence  that my prayer was answered.    The next morning at daylight I informed my friends that I must  depart in search of my field of labor. They asked me to stay  until breakfast, but I refused. One of the negroes put me over  the river, and directed me how to cross the mountains on the  trail that was much shorter than the wagon road. I stopped in a  little cove and ate a number of fine, ripe cherries. I then went  on until I reached what to me was enchanted ground. I met the two  sisters at the gate, and asked them if their father was at home.    \"No, he is not at home,\" said the ladies, \"he has gone to the  ferry to find a Mormon preacher, and see if he can get him to  come here and preach in this neighborhood.\"    They then said I must have met him on the road. I told them that  I had come over the mountain trail, and said I was probably the  man he had gone for. They replied:    \"Our father said that if you came this way, to have you stop and  stay here until his return, and to tell you that you are welcome  to preach at our house at any time.\"    This was on Friday. I took out my pencil and wrote a notice that  I would preach at that place on the following Sunday, at 10  o'clock, a. m. I handed it to the girls. They agreed to have the  appointment circulated. I passed on and preached at a place  twelve miles from there, and returned in time for my appointment.    When I arrived within sight of the place of meeting I was filled  with doubt and anxiety. I trembled all over, for I saw that a  vast concourse of people had come to hear an inexperienced man  preach the gospel. I went into the grove and again prayed for  strength and assistance from my Father in Heaven, to enable me to  speak His truth aright. I felt strengthened and comforted. As I  arose from prayer these words came into my mind:    \"Truth is mighty and will prevail.\"    Thereafter I waited until the hour arrived for preaching; then I  approached the place where I had once been in a vision.    This meeting place was in a valley, near a cold, pure spring; on  either side was a high, elevated country; in the center of this  valley there stood a large blacksmith and wagon shop, surrounded  with a bower of brushwood to protect the audience from the sun.  This bower, in which I was to preach, would seat one thousand  people.    In the center of the bower they had erected a framework or raised  platform for a pulpit. I took my place and preached for one hour  and a half. My tongue was like the pen of a ready writer. I  scarcely knew what I was saying. I then opened the doors of the  Church for the admission of members. Five persons joined the  Church, and I appointed another meeting for that night. I again  preached, when two more joined the Church.    The next day I baptized the seven new members. I then arranged to  hold meetings at that place three times a week. I visited around  the country, seeking to convert sinners. The first converts were  leading people in that county.    Elisha Sanders and his wife and daughter were the first to  receive the gospel. Sanders was a farmer; he had a large flour  mill, owned a woodyard, and was engaged in boat building on the  Cumberland River. Caroline C. Sanders had volunteered to publish  the appointment of my first meeting, which I left with the  daughters of Mr. Smith. I labored at this place two months, and  baptized twenty-eight persons, mostly the heads of families. I  then organized them into a branch of the Church.    Brother Sanders fitted up a room very handsomely for me, in which  I could retire for study, rest, and secret prayer. I was made to  feel at home there, and knew that God had answered my prayers. I  had the knowledge that God's Spirit accompanied my words,  carrying conviction to the hearts of sinful hearers, and giving  me souls as seals to my"]]]
