The most satisfactory lazuli song I heard was on the western side of the  range, at the resort called Glenwood. This time, as was usually the  case, I heard the little triller before seeing him, and was sure it was  _Passerina amoena_, as the bunting strains were plainly discernible.  He was sitting on a telephone wire, and did not flit away as I stood  below and peered at him through my glass, and admired his trig and  handsome form. I studied his song, and tried to fix the peculiar  intonations in my mind, and felt positive that I could never be caught  again--but I was.[8]        [8] In the foregoing remarks the lazuli finches have been      represented as excessively shy. So they were in 1899 in the      neighborhoods then visited. Strangely enough, in the vicinity of      Denver in 1901, these birds were abundant and as easily approached      and studied as are the indigoes of the East. See the chapter      entitled, \"Plains and Foothills.\"    The lazuli finch does not venture very high into the mountains, seldom  reaching an altitude of more than seven thousand feet. He is a lover of  the plains, the foothills, and the lower ranges of the mountains. In  this respect he differs from some other little birds, which seek a  summer home in the higher regions. On the southern slope of Pike's Peak,  a little below the timber-line, I found a dainty little bird which was a  stranger to me. It was Audubon's warbler. At first sight I decided that  he must be the myrtle warbler, but was compelled to change my conclusion  when I got a glimpse of his throat, which was golden yellow, whereas the  throat of _Dendroica coronata_ is pure white. Then, too, the myrtle  warbler is only a migrant in Colorado, passing farther north to breed.  Audubon's, it must be said, has extremely rich habiliments, his upper  parts being bluish-ash, streaked with black, his belly and under  tail-coverts white, and his breast in high feather, black, prettily  skirted with gray or invaded with white from below; but his yellow  spots, set like gleaming gold in various parts of his plumage,  constitute his most marked embellishment, being found on the crown,  rump, throat, and each side of the chest.    On my first excursion to some meadows and wooded low-grounds south of  Colorado Springs, while listening to a concert given by western  meadow-larks, my attention was attracted to a large, black bird circling  about the fields and then alighting on a fence-post. My first thought  was: \"It is only a crow blackbird.\" But on second thought I decided that  the crow blackbird did not soar and circle about in this manner. At all  events, there seemed to be something slightly peculiar about this bird's  behavior, so I went nearer to inspect him, when he left his perch on the  post, flapped around over the meadow, and finally flew to a large,  partially decayed cottonwood tree in a pasture field. If I could believe  my eyes, he clung to the upright stems of the branches after the style  of a woodpecker! That was queer indeed--a woodpecker that looked  precisely like a blackbird! Such a featherland oddity was certainly  foreign to any of my calculations; for, it must be remembered, this was  prior to my making acquaintance with Williamson's sapsucker.    Closer inspection proved that this bird was actually hitching up and  down the branches of the tree in the regular woodpecker fashion.  Presently he slipped into a hole in a large limb, and the loud, eager  chirping of young birds was heard. It was not long before his mate  appeared, entered the cavity, and fed the clamorous brood. The birds  proved to be Lewis's woodpeckers, another distinctly western type. My  field-glass soon clearly brought out their peculiar markings.    A beautiful bird-skin, bought of Mr. Charles E. Aiken, now lies on my  desk and enables me to describe the fine habiliments of this kind from  an actual specimen. His upper parts are glossy black, the sheen on the  back being greenish, and that on the wings and tail bluish or purplish,  according to the angle of the sun's light; a white collar prettily  encircles the neck, becoming quite narrow on the nape, but widening out  on the side so as to cover the entire breast and throat. This pectoral  shield is mottled with black and lightly stained with buff in spots; the  forehead, chin, superciliary line, and a broad space on the cheek are  dyed a deep crimson; and, not least by any means, the abdomen is washed  with pink, which is delicately stencilled with white, gray, and buff. A  most gorgeous bird, fairly rivalling, but not distancing, Williamson's  sapsucker.    By accident I made a little discovery relative to the claws of this  woodpecker which, I suppose, would be true of all the _Picidae_ family.  The claws of the two fore toes are sharply curved and extremely acute,  making genuine hooks, so that when I attempt to pass my finger over them  the points catch at the skin. Could a better hook be contrived for  enabling the bird to clamber up the trunks and branches of trees? But  note: the claws of the two hind toes are not so sharply decurved, nor  so acute at the points, the finger slipping readily over them. Who can  deny the evidence of design in nature? The fore claws are highly  specialized for clinging, the very purpose for which they are needed,  while the hind claws, being used for a different purpose--only that of  support--are moulded over a different pattern.    Like our common red-head, this bird has the habit of soaring out into  the air and nabbing insects on the wing. The only other pair of these  woodpeckers I was so fortunate as to meet with were found in the ravine  leading up from Buena Vista to Cottonwood Lake.[9] Their nest was in a  dead tree by the roadside. While the first couple had been entirely  silent, one of the second pair chirped somewhat uneasily when I lingered  beneath his tree, suspecting, no doubt, that I had sinister designs upon  his nest. Unlike some of their kinsmen, these pickers of wood seem to be  quiet and dignified, not given to much demonstration, and are quite  leisurely in their movements both on the branch and on the wing.        [9] Two years later a pair were seen on a mountain near Golden,      Colorado, and probably twenty individuals were watched a long time      from a canyon above Boulder as they circled gracefully over the      mountains, catching insects on the wing.    One day, when walking up Ute Pass, celebrated both for its magnificent  scenery and its Indian history, I first saw the water-ousel. I had been  inspecting Rainbow Falls, and was duly impressed with its  attractiveness. Thinking I had lingered long enough, I turned away and  clambered up the rocky wall below the falls towards the road above. As I  did so, a loud, bell-like song rang above the roar of the water. On  looking down into the ravine, I saw a mouse-colored bird, a little  smaller than the robin, his tail perked up almost vertically, scuttling  about on the rocks below and dipping his body in an expressive way like  the \"tip-up\" sandpiper. Having read about this bird, I at once  recognized it as the water-ousel. My interest in everything else  vanished. This was one of the birds I had made my pilgrimage to the  Rockies to study. It required only a few minutes to scramble down into  the ravine again.    Breathlessly I watched the little bird. Its queer teetering is like that  of some of the wrens, accentors, and water-thrushes. Now it ran to the  top of a rock and stood dipping and eying me narrowly, flirting its  bobby tail; now it flew to one of the steep, almost vertical walls of  rock and scrambled up to a protuberance; then down again to the water;  then, to my intense delight, it plunged into the limpid stream, and came  up the next moment with a slug or water-beetle in its bill. Presently it  flew over to the opposite wall, its feet slipping on the wet rocks, and  darted into a small crevice just below the foot of the falls, gave a  quick poke with its beak and flitted away--minus the tidbit it had held  in its bill.    _RAINBOW FALLS_    _When the sun strikes the spray and mist at the proper angle, a  beautiful rainbow is painted on the face of the falls. At the time of  the author's visit to this idyllic spot a pair of water-ousels had  chosen it for a summer residence. They flew from the rocks below to the  top of the falls, hugging close to the rushing torrent. In returning,  they darted in one swift plunge from the top to the bottom, alighting on  the rocks below. With the utmost abandon they dived into the seething  waters at the foot of the falls, usually emerging with a slug or beetle  in their bills for the nestlings. Shod with tall rubber boots, the  writer waded close up to the foot of the falls in search of the dipper's  nest, which was set in a cleft of the rocks a few inches above the  water, in the little shadowed cavern at the left of the stream. The  pointed rock wrapped in mist, almost in the line of the plunging tide,  was a favorite perch for the dippers._    [Illustration]    Ah! my propitious stars shone on me that day with special favor. I had  found not only the water-ousel itself, but also its nest. Suddenly  water-ousel number two, the mate of number one, appeared on the scene,  dipped, scanned me closely, flew to the slippery wall, darted to the  cranny, and deposited its morsel, as its spouse had done. This time I  heard the chirping of the youngsters. Before examining the nest I  decided to watch the performances of the parent birds, which soon cast  off all the restraint caused for a moment by my presence, taking me, no  doubt, for the ordinary sightseer who overlooks them altogether.    Again and again the birds plunged into the churning flood at the foot of  the falls, sometimes remaining under water what seemed a long while, and  always coming to the surface with a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25992"],[0,"The Martyrs of Science, or, The lives of Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler (#18)"],[1,"that it was similar to the  one observed by Hipparchus, and urged Tycho to publish the observations  which he had made upon it. Tycho refused to accede to this request, on  the pretext that his work was not sufficiently perfect; but the true  reason, as he afterwards acknowledged, was, that he considered it would  be a disgrace for a nobleman, either to study such subjects, or to  communicate them to the public. This absurd notion was with some  difficulty overcome, and through the earnest entreaties and assistance  of Pratensis, his work on the new star was published in 1573.    This remarkable body presents to us one of the most interesting  phenomena in astronomy. The date of its first appearance has not been  exactly ascertained. Tycho saw it on the 11th November, but Cornelius  Gemma had seen it on the 9th, Paul Hainzel saw it on the 7th of August  at Augsburg, and Wolfgangus Schulerus observed it at Wittenberg on the  6th. Tycho conjectures that it was first seen on the 5th, and Hieronymus  Munosius asserts that at Valentia, in Spain, it was not seen on the 2d,  when he was shewing that part of the heavens to his pupils. This  singular body continued to be seen during 16 months, and did not  disappear till March 1574. In its appearance it was exactly like a star,  having none of the distinctive marks of a comet. It twinkled strongly,  and grew larger than _Lyra_ or _Sirius_, or any other fixed star. It  seemed to be somewhat larger than _Jupiter_, when he is nearest the  earth, and rivalled _Venus_ in her greatest brightness. In the _first_  month of its appearance it was less than Jupiter; in the _second_ it  equalled him; in the _third_ it surpassed him in splendour; in the  _fourth_ it was equal to _Sirius_; in the _fifth_ to _Lyra_; in the  _sixth_ and _seventh_ to stars of the _second_ magnitude; in the  _eighth_, _ninth_, and _tenth_, to stars of the _third_ magnitude; in  the _eleventh_, _twelfth_, and _thirteenth_, to stars of the _fourth_  magnitude; in the _fourteenth_ and _fifteenth_ to stars of the _fifth_  magnitude; and in the _sixteenth_ month to stars of the _sixth_  magnitude. After this it became so small that it at last disappeared.  Its colour changed also with its size. At first it was white and bright;  in the third month it began to become yellowish; in the fifth it became  reddish like Aldebaran; and in the seventh and eighth it became bluish  like Saturn; growing afterwards duller and duller. Its place in the  heavens was invariable. Its longitude was in the 6th degree and 54th  minute of Taurus; and its latitude 53 deg. 45' north. Its right ascension  was 0 deg. 26-2/5' and its declination 61 deg. 46-3/4'. It had no parallax, and  was unquestionably situated in the region of the fixed stars.    After Tycho had published his book, he proposed to travel into Germany  and Italy, but he was seized with a fever, and he had no sooner  recovered from it, than he became involved in a love affair, which  frustrated all his schemes. Although Tycho was afraid of casting a  stain upon his nobility by publishing his observations on the new star,  yet he did not scruple to debase his lineage by marrying a peasant girl  of the village of Knudstorp. This event took place in 1573, and in 1574  his wife gave birth to his daughter Magdalene. Tycho's noble relations  were deeply offended at this imprudent step; and so far did the mutual  animosity of the parties extend, that the King himself was obliged to  effect a reconciliation.    The fame of our author as an astronomer and mathematician was now so  high, that several young Danish nobles requested him to deliver a course  of lectures upon these interesting subjects. This application was  seconded by Pratensis, Danzeus, and all his best friends; but their  solicitations were vain. The King at last made the request in a way  which ensured its being granted, and Tycho delivered a course of  lectures, in which he not only gave a full view of the science of  astronomy, but defended and explained all the reveries of astrology.    Having finished his lectures, and arranged his domestic affairs, he set  out on his projected journey about the beginning of the spring of 1575,  leaving behind him his wife and daughter, till he should fix upon a  place of permanent residence. The first town which he visited was  Hesse-Cassel, the residence of William, Landgrave of Hesse, whose  patronage of astronomy, and whose skill in making celestial  observations, have immortalized his name. Here Tycho spent eight or ten  delightful days, during which the two astronomers were occupied one half  of the day in scientific conversation, and the other half in  astronomical observations; and he would have prolonged a visit which  gave him so much pleasure, had not the death of one of the Landgrave's  daughters interrupted their labours. Passing through Frankfort, Tycho  went into Switzerland; and, after visiting many cities on his way, he  fixed upon Basle as a place of residence, not only from its centrical  position, but from the salubrity of the air, and the cheapness of  living. From Switzerland he went to Venice, and, in returning through  Germany, he came to Ratisbon, at the time of the congress, which had  been called together on the 1st of November, for the coronation of the  Emperor Rudolph. On this occasion he met with several distinguished  individuals, who were not only skilled in astronomy, but who were among  its warmest patrons. From Ratisbon he passed to Saalfeld, and thence to  Wittemburg, where he saw the parallactic instruments and the wooden  quadrant which had been used by John Pratensis in determining the  latitude of the city, and in measuring the altitudes of the new star.    Tycho was now impatient for home, and he lost no time in returning to  Denmark, where events were awaiting him which frustrated all his  schemes, by placing him in the most favourable situation for promoting  his own happiness, and advancing the interests of astronomy.          CHAPTER II.         _Frederick II. patronises Tycho--And resolves to establish him in       Denmark--Grants him the Island of Huen for Life--And Builds the       splendid Observatory of Uraniburg--Description of the Island, and       of the Observatory--Account of its Astronomical Instruments--Tycho       begins his Observations--His Pupils--Tycho is made Canon of       Rothschild, and receives a large Pension--His Hospitality to his       Visitors--Ingratitude of Witichius--Tycho sends an Assistant to       take the Latitude of Frauenburg and Konigsberg--Is visited by       Ulric, Duke of Mecklenburg--Change in Tycho's fortunes._      The patronage which had been extended to astronomers by several of the  reigning princes of Germany, especially by the Landgrave of Hesse, and  Augustus, Elector of Saxony, had begun to excite a love of science in  the minds of other sovereigns. The King of Denmark seems to have felt it  as a stain upon his character, that the only astronomer in his dominions  should carry on his observations in distant kingdoms and adorn by his  discoveries other courts than his own. With this feeling he sent  ambassadors to Hesse-Cassel to inquire after Tycho, and to intimate to  him his wish that he should return to Denmark, and his anxiety to  promote the advancement of astronomy in his own dominions. Tycho had  left Cassel when these messengers arrived, and had heard nothing of the  King's intentions till he was about to quit Knudstorp with his family  for Basle. At this time he was surprised at the arrival of a noble  messenger, who brought a letter requesting him to meet the King as soon  as possible at Copenhagen. Tycho lost no time in obeying the royal  summons. The King received him with the most flattering kindness. He  offered to give him a grant for life of the island of Huen, between  Denmark and Sweden, and to construct and furnish with instruments, at  his own expense, an observatory, as well as a house for the  accommodation of his family, together with a laboratory for carrying on  his chemical inquiries. Tycho, who truly loved his country, was deeply  affected with the munificence of the royal offer. He accepted of it with  that warmth of gratitude which it was calculated to inspire; and he  particularly rejoiced in the thought that if any success should attend  his future labours, the glory of it would belong to his native land.    The island of Huen is about sxix miles from the coast of Zealand, three  from that of Sweden, and fourteen from Copenhagen. It is six miles in  circumference, and rises into the form of a mountain, which, though very  high, terminates in a plain. It is nowhere rocky, and even in the time  of Tycho it produced the best kinds of grain, afforded excellent  pasturage for horses, cattle, and sheep, and possessed deer, hares,  rabbits, and partridges in abundance. It contained at that time only one  village, with about forty inhabitants.    Having surveyed his new territory, Tycho resolved to build a magnificent  tower in the centre of the elevated plain, which he resolved to call  Uraniburg, or _The City of the Heavens_. Having made the necessary  arrangements, he repaired to the island on the 8th of August, and his  friend Charles Danzeus laid the foundation stone of the new observatory,  which consisted of a slab of porphyry, with the following  inscription:--         REGNANTE IN DANIA FREDERICO II., CAROLUS DANZAEUS AQUITANUS R.
