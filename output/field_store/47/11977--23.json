And what is its context on this occasion? \"The subject is the execution  of those great powers on which the welfare of a nation essentially  depends.\" The provision occurs \"in a Constitution intended to endure  for ages to come and consequently to be adapted to the various crises of  human affairs.\" The purpose of the clause therefore is not to impair  the right of Congress \"to exercise its best judgment in the selection  of measures to carry into execution the constitutional powers of the  Government,\" but rather \"to remove all doubts respecting the right to  legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which must be involved  in the Constitution, if that instrument be not a splendid bauble.... Let  the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution  and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that  end, which are not prohibited but consist with the letter and spirit of  the Constitution, are constitutional.\"    But was the Act of Maryland which taxed the Bank in conflict with the  Act of Congress which established it? If so, must the State yield to  Congress? In approaching this question Marshall again laid the basis  for as sweeping a decision as possible. The terms in which the Maryland  statute was couched indicated clearly that it was directed specifically  against the Bank, and it might easily have been set aside on that  ground. But Marshall went much further and laid down the principle that  the instrumentalities of the National Government are never subject to  taxation by the States in any form whatsoever, and for two reasons.  In the first place, \"those means are not given by the people of a  particular State... but by the people of all the States. They are given  by all far the benefit of all,\" and owe their presence in the State  not to the State's permission but to a higher authority. The State of  Maryland therefore never had the power to tax the Bank in the first  place. Yet waiving this theory, there was, in the second place, flat  incompatibility between the Act of Maryland and the Act of Congress,  not simply because of the specific operation of the former, but rather  because of the implied claim which it made for state authority. \"That  the power to tax involves the power to destroy,\" Marshall continued;  \"that the power to destroy may defeat and render useless the power to  create; that there is a plain repugnance in conferring on one government  a power to control the constitutional measures of another, which other,  with respect to those very measures is declared to be supreme over that  which exerts the control, are propositions not to be denied.\" Nor indeed  is the sovereignty of the State confined to taxation. \"That is not the  only mode in which it might be displayed. The question is in truth, a  question of supremacy, and if the right of the States to tax the means  employed by the General Government be conceded, the declaration that the  Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof shall be supreme law  of the land, is empty and unmeaning declamation.... We are unanimously  of opinion,\" concluded the Chief Justice, \"that the law... of Maryland,  imposing a tax on the Bank of the United States is unconstitutional and  void.\"    Five years later, in the case of Gibbons vs. Ogden, * known to  contemporaries as the \"Steamboat case,\" Marshall received the  opportunity to apply his principles of constitutional construction to  the power of Congress to regulate \"commerce among the States.\" For a  quarter of a century Robert R. Livingston and Robert Fulton and their  successors had enjoyed from the Legislature of New York a grant of the  exclusive right to run steamboats on the waters of the State, and in  this case one of their licensees, Ogden, was seeking to prevent Gibbons,  who had steamers in the coasting trade under an Act of Congress, from  operating them on the Hudson in trade between points in New York and New  Jersey. A circumstance which made the case the more critical was  that New Jersey and Connecticut had each passed retaliatory  statutes excluding from their waters any vessel licensed under the  Fulton-Livingston monopoly. The condition of interstate commercial  warfare which thus threatened was not unlike that which had originally  operated so potently to bring about the Constitution.       * 9 Wheaton, 1.      The case of Gibbons vs. Ogden was argued in the early days of February,  1824, with Attorney-General Wirt and Daniel Webster against the grant,  while two famous New York lawyers of the day, Thomas Addis Emmet,  brother of the Irish patriot, and Thomas J. Oakley, acted as Ogden's  counsel. The arguments have the importance necessarily attaching to a  careful examination of a novel legal question of the first magnitude by  learned and acute minds, but some of the claims that have been made for  these arguments, and especially for Webster's effort, hardly sustain  investigation. Webster, never in any case apt to regard his own  performance overcritically, seems in later years to have been persuaded  that the Chief Justice's opinion \"followed closely the track\" of his  argument on this occasion; and it is true that Marshall expressed  sympathy with Webster's contention that Congress may regulate as truly  by inaction as by action, since inaction may indicate its wish that the  matter go unregulated; but the Chief Justice did not explicitly adopt  this idea, and the major part of his opinion was a running refutation  of Emmet's argument, which in turn was only an elaboration of Chancellor  Kent's opinion upon the same subject in the New York courts. * In other  words, this was one of those cases in which Marshall's indebtedness to  counsel was far less for ideas than for the stimulation which his  own powers always received from discussion; and the result is his  profoundest, most statesmanlike opinion, from whose doctrines the Court  has at times deviated, but only to return to them, until today it is  more nearly than ever before the established law on the many points  covered by its dicta.       * See Livingston vs. Van Ingen, 9 Johnson, 807 (1812); also  Kent's \"Commentaries\", I, 432-38.      Marshall pronounced the Fulton-Livingston monopoly inoperative so far as  it concerned vessels enrolled under the Act of Congress to engage in the  coasting trade; but in arriving at this very simple result his opinion  takes the broadest possible range. At the very outset Marshall  flatly contradicts Kent's proposition that the powers of the General  Government, as representing a grant by sovereignties, must be strictly  construed. The Constitution, says he, \"contains an enumeration of powers  expressly granted by the people to their government,\" and there is not  a word in it which lends any countenance to the idea that these powers  should be strictly interpreted. As men whose intentions required no  concealment, those who framed and adopted the Constitution \"must be  understood to have employed words in their natural sense and to have  intended what they said\"; but if, from the inherent imperfection of  language, doubts were at any time to arise \"respecting the extent of any  given power,\" then the known purposes of the instrument should control  the construction put on its phraseology. \"The grant does not convey  power which might be beneficial to the grantor if retained by  himself... but is an investment of power for the general advantage in  the hands of agents selected for the purpose, which power can never be  exercised by the people themselves, but must be placed in the hands of  agents or remain dormant.\" In no other of his opinions did Marshall  so clearly bring out the logical connection between the principle of  liberal construction of the Constitution and the doctrine that it is an  ordinance of the American people.    Turning then to the Constitution, Marshall asks, \"What is commerce?\"  \"Counsel for appellee,\" he recites, \"would limit it to traffic, to  buying and selling,\" to which he answers that \"this would restrict a  general term... to one of its significations. Commerce,\" he continues,  \"undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more--it is intercourse,\"  and so includes navigation. And what is the power of Congress over  commerce? \"It is the power to regulate, that is, the power to prescribe  the rule by which commerce is to be governed.\" It is a power \"complete  in itself,\" exercisable \"at its utmost extent,\" and without limitations  \"other than are prescribed by the Constitution.... If, as has always  been understood, the sovereignty of Congress, though limited to  specified objects, is plenary as to those objects, the power over  commerce with foreign nations and among the several States is vested in  Congress as absolutely as it would be in a single government having in  its constitution the same restrictions on the exercise of power as are  found in the Constitution of the United States.\" The power, therefore,  is not to be confined by state lines but acts upon its subject-matter  wherever it is to be found. \"It may, of consequence, pass the  jurisdictional line of New York and act upon the very waters to which  the prohibition now under consideration applies.\" It is a power to be  exercised within the States and not merely at their frontiers.    But was it sufficient for Marshall merely to define the power of  Congress? Must not the power of the State also be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32934"],[0,"The Young Colonists: A Story of the Zulu and Boer Wars (#18)"],[1," Column.\"  Major-General Marshall assumed command of the cavalry brigade, and  Major-General the Hon.  H.H.  Clifford, C.B., V.C., took up the command  of the base of operations and superintendence of the lines of  communication.

So that altogether, deducting, say, 1500,  Lord Chelmsford had at his disposal, from the middle of April, a total  of 21,000 troops, of which over 15,000 were European.  Colonels Pearson  and Wood were made Brigadier-Generals, and the former was to command  Number 1 Brigade, 1st Division, and Colonel Pemberton, 3-60th, the  other.  They both, however, had to give up their commands through  sickness, and Colonels Rowland, V.C., C.B., and Clark, 57th Regiment,  succeeded them.    Major-General Clifford, V.C., C.B., had the following staff for the  management of the base of the operations and the maintenance of the  lines of communication between Zululand and Natal:--    Lieutenant Westmacott, 77th Foot, aide-de-camp; Major W.J.  Butler,  C.B., assistant-adjutant and quartermaster-general, stationed at Durban;  and Captain W.R.  Fox, Royal Artillery, deputy assistant-adjutant and  quartermaster-general.    On the arrival of the boys with the waggons at Pieter-Maritzburg, they  reported themselves at the headquarters of the transport corps, and were  told that they were not to go down to Durban, but were to load up at  once and accompany the Dragoon Guards, who were to march the next  morning for the front.    This time the lads were mounted, as their fathers thought that they  would gain more benefit from their experience if they were able to move  about instead of being confined to the sides of their waggons, and it  was a satisfaction to their mothers that, in case of any untoward event  again happening, they would be in a better position for making their  escape.    General Newdigate's columns were encamped at Landmann's Drift; the  cavalry, under General Marshall, was also there.  The march was  altogether without incident.    Some days passed quietly, when a small party of horse made an expedition  to Isandula; they reported that nearly a hundred waggons were still  standing upon the field of battle.  On the 17th of May, three days  later, the rumour ran through the camp that the cavalry were to start on  the 19th, to bury the dead and bring away the waggons.  The Army Service  Corps and waggons were to accompany the party, which was to consist of  the Dragoon Guards and Lancers, with a party of native mounted scouts.    In the afternoon of the 18th the two boys went to Colonel Marshall's  tent; they waited patiently until he came out, accompanied by two or  three other officers.    \"We have come to ask, sir, if you will allow us to go with your column.  We are in charge of waggons here, but they are not going.  We were at  the battle, and saw the whole thing, and were taken prisoners afterwards  and carried to Umbelleni's kraal, where we were liberated when Colonel  Wood's cavalry attacked the Zlobani hill.  We are well mounted, sir, and  are good shots; so, if you will let us go, we could keep with the scouts  and not be in your way.\"    \"How did you see the fight?\"  General Marshall asked.    \"We had gone up to the top of the hill, sir, before it began, and  fortunately the natives did not notice us.\"    \"Oh, yes, you can go,\" the general said.  \"Probably you can give us a  better account of the action than any one else, as others who escaped  were occupied by their own business, and could not mark the general  progress of the battle.  So you were taken prisoners!  Well, I am going  out now, but if you will call in this evening at about half-past eight,  I shall be glad to have a talk with you.\"    In the evening the boys called upon the general, one of the most popular  and dashing officers in the service.  Three or four of his staff were  there, and all listened with great interest to the boys' account of  their adventures.    \"You seem to have plenty of pluck and coolness, youngsters,\" the general  said, when they had finished.  \"In future you need not trouble to ask  for permission to accompany me whenever the cavalry go out, providing we  have natives mounted with us; you must go as recruits, and can either  keep with them or ride with my orderlies.\"    Much pleased with the permission given, the lads returned to the  waggons, and the next morning they started on their way.    The column bivouacked that night at Dill's Town, and reached Rorke's  Drift between three and four o'clock in the morning, and were there  joined by the Natal Carabineers and Colonel Harness, R.A., with guns.    At daybreak on the 20th the reconnoitring force crossed the river.  No  signs of the enemy were seen until they neared Isandula; then  signal-fires blazed up on the hills to the right, and spread quickly  from hill to hill far into the interior.  Pushing steadily on, the plain  of Isandula was reached by ten o'clock.  The whole scene of the conflict  was overgrown with long grass, thickly intermixed with growing crops of  oats and Indian corn.  Lying thickly here, and scattered over a wide  area, lay the corpses of the soldiers.  The site of the camp itself was  marked by the remains of the tents, intermingled with a mass of broken  trunks, boxes, meat-tins, papers, books, and letters in wild disorder.  The sole visible objects, however, rising above the grass, were the  waggons, all more or less broken up.    The scouts were placed in all directions to give warning of the approach  of any enemies.  The Army Service Corps set to work to harness the  seventy pairs of led horses they had brought with them to the best of  the waggons, and the troops wandered over the scene of the engagement,  and searched for and buried all the bodies they found, with the  exception of those of the 24th Regiment, as these, Colonel Glyn had  asked, should be left to be buried by their comrades.  The bodies of the  officers of Colonel Durnford's corps were all found together, showing  that when all hope of escape was gone they had formed in a group and  defended themselves to the last.  The men of the Royal Artillery buried  all the bodies of their slain comrades who could be found, but the  shortness of the time and the extent of the ground over which the fight  had extended rendered anything like a thorough search impossible.    The object of the expedition was not to fight, and as at any moment the  Zulus might appear in force upon the field, a start was made as soon as  the waggons were ready.  Forty of the best waggons were brought out,  with some water-carts, a gun-limber and a rocket-battery cart.  Twenty  waggons in a disabled condition were left behind.  Some seventy waggons  were missing, these having been carried off by the Zulus, filled either  with stores or with their own wounded.  Having accomplished this work  the cavalry rejoined headquarters at Landmann's Drift.    On the 27th of May the column advanced, Newdigate's division leading the  way.  By two o'clock in the afternoon the men had crossed the Buffalo  and marched to Kopje-allein through a bare and treeless country.  One of  the most popular figures in the camp was the Prince Imperial of France,  who, having received a"]]]
