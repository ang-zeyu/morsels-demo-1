Then at night there had been the same outspanning to see to;  the feeding of the bullocks; the collection of wood and lighting of as  big a fire as he could contrive, to cook his food, boil his coffee, and,  finally, make up to scare off wild beasts.  In addition to this, a thorn  protection ought to have been made to keep off danger from Breezy, but  that was impossible; and hour after hour Dyke had sat in the darkness,  where the cob's rein was made fast to the wagon tail, and, gun in hand,  had watched over the trembling beast, keeping him company when the  distant roaring of lions was heard on the veldt, and the bullocks grew  uneasy.    Little sleep fell to Dyke's lot by night; but in the daytime, when the  bullocks were going steadily along the track, which they followed  willingly enough for the most part, the boy's head would sink down upon  his breast, and he would snatch a few minutes' rest, often enough to  start up and find the wagon at a standstill, and the bullocks cropping  some patch of grass or the tender shoots of a clump of bushes.    Then on again, with at times the great whip exchanged for the gun, and  some bird or another laid low, so as to find him in extra provisions by  the way.  Once, too, he managed to hit a little buck.    A long, doleful, and weary journey, without meeting a soul, or being  passed.  On and on, over the never-ending plain, often despairing, and  with the oxen groaning, empty as the wagon was, for the sun flashed and  was reflected up with blinding force, and there were moments when Dyke  grew giddy, and felt as if he must break down.    But those were only moments.  He set his teeth again, and trudged on or  rode, thinking of Joe waiting patiently away there in the lonely,  corrugated iron building, tending the ostriches, and feeling in perfect  confidence that the journey would be achieved, and the necessary stores  brought back.    There were moments, though, when Dyke brightened up, and told himself  that he would do it if he tried till to-morrow morning; and at such  times he laughed--or rather tried to laugh--for it was rather a painful  process, his face being sore and the skin ready to peel away.    But at last, after escaping danger after danger by a hair's-breadth, the  great weariness of the almost interminable journey was coming to an end,  for, far away in the distance, there was a building visible through the  clear air.  He could see a broad stretch of green, too, looking  delightful with waving trees, after the arid wilderness through which he  had passed; and now, in spite of his great fatigue, Dyke plucked up  courage, for the building must be Oom Morgenstern's farm, and in an hour  or so the traveller felt that the first part of his journey was at an  end.    Once or twice a feeling of doubt troubled him, but that soon passed off,  for reason told him that he could not be wrong--this must be the point  for which he had been aiming.    The bullocks began to move more briskly now, for they could see green  pasture in the far distance, and there was a moister feeling in the air,  suggestive of water not far away.    So Dyke's task grew lighter, and an hour or so later he could see a big,  heavy, grey man standing outside an untidy-looking building, littered  about with cask and case, and who saluted him as he halted his team:    \"Ach! das is goot.  How you vas, mein bube?\"    \"Here, I say,\" cried Dyke, as the big German shook hands with him, \"who  are you calling a booby, Uncle Morgenstern?\"    \"Hey?  You vas bube.  Not gall yourself mans, long time ago to gom.  Bube ist poy, goot poy.  Zo you gom vrom Kopfontein all py youzelf to  puy mealies and dea, and goffee and sugars?\"    \"Well, not quite all alone; I've got our Kaffir with me.\"    \"Ach! ten: why you not make him drive die pullock?  Lazy tog!\"    \"He's in the wagon, bad.  I've had to drive the bullocks, and inspan and  outspan all by myself.\"    \"Ach! wonterful!  All py youself.  Goot poy.  Ant you are hot, und sehr  dursty.\"    \"Oh yes, horribly thirsty.\"    \"Goot!  Die Frau shall make you zom of mein beaudiful goffees.  Das is  good vor dursdy.--Hi!\" he shouted; and a couple of Kaffir boys came from  behind a rough shed, to whom he gave instructions to outspan the oxen  and drive them to the abundant pasture by the river side.    \"Goot!  Now led me see der pad mensch.  Zo you haf put you Kaffir in you  wagon, and give him a pig ride.\"    \"Yes; I thought he was going to die.\"    \"Zo?  Ah! zom beebles would haf left him oonter a dree, und zay do him:  `Mein vrient, you had petter make youself guite well as zoon as you gan.  I muss nicht shtop.  Goot-bye.'  But you did bring him in dem wagon,  hey?\"    \"Oh yes: I could not leave him.\"    \"You are a goot poy, my young vrient.  And how is der big bruder?\"    \"Quite well,\" said Dyke, looking uneasy as the big, frank-faced, fat,  German Boer questioned him.    \"Why did he not gom too?  I like den big bruder.\"    \"Too busy minding the young ostriches.\"    \"Ach zo!  Of goorse.  Ant you make blenty of money--you gut off der  vedders, and zend dem to der Gape?\"    \"Oh no.  We're doing very badly: the young birds die so fast.\"    \"Zo?  Das ist sehr, very bad.  You had petter zell mealie und gorn, und  dea und sugars.  It ist mooch petters as neffer vas, and you not haf to  gom five, zigs, zeven days to me.  Now let us zee den Kaffirs.\"    The old man had approached the back of the wagon as he spoke, and now  drew the canvas aside, to be greeted by a low growl which made him start  back.    \"Tunder!\" he cried.  \"Der Kaffir tog is gone mad!\"    \"No, no; that is our dog Duke.\"    \"Ah!  Und is he pad too?\"    \"Yes: a leopard came and seized him one night and carried him off from  under the wagon; but I ran out and fired, and I suppose I hit the beast,  for there was a lot of snarling and Duke got away; but I thought he  would have died.\"    \"Ach! boor togs den.  What you do to him?\"    \"Bathed the places with water.\"    \"Goot!\"    \"And he licked the wounds himself.\"    \"Besser.\"    \"And curled himself up, and went to sleep.\"    \"Das vas der best of all, mein young vrient.  Aha!  Goot tog, den.  You  let me zee how you vas pad.  I am your master's vrient; das ist zo.\"    He advanced his hand to where Duke lay just inside the canvas, and the  dog gave the skin on which he lay two thumps with his tail.    \"Das ist goot,\" said the old German trader.  \"Ach! yaas; you haf been  pite on dem pack, und scratch, scratch along bofe your zides; boot you  are a prave tog, and zoon be guite well again.\"    Duke's tail performed quite a fantasia now, and he uttered a low whine  and licked at the great, fat, friendly hand which patted his head.    \"Und now vere is der poy?\"    \"Get into the wagon,\" said Dyke; and the German climbed in, followed by  Dyke, and stooped down over the figure of Kaffir Jack, who lay on a  blanket, with his head toward the front part of the wagon, through which  opening the evening light still streamed.    The Kaffir's head was tied-up with a bandage formed of the sleeve of a  shirt cut off at the shoulder, split up lengthwise at the seams, tied  together so as to make it long enough, and this was stained with blood,  evidently days old.    The Boer gazed down at the Kaffir, and Jack gazed up at him, screwing up  his face in the most piteous fashion.    This scrutiny on both sides went on for some time in a silence which was  at last broken by the Kaffir uttering a dismal groan which went right to  Dyke's heart.    \"Ah,\" said the trader softly, \"boor vellow!  How you vas?\"    Jack uttered a more dismal groan than before.    \"Ah, vas it den?  Boor mans! you zeem as bad as neffer can be.  You  doomble off dem vagon, und dread on your vace like dot?\"    \"Oh!\" groaned Jack.  \"Baas killum.\"    \"Did he den.  Der baas kill der boor vellow dead?\"  Then suddenly  changing his tone from one full of soft sympathy to a burst of fierce  anger, he roared out: \"Dunder und lightning!  You get oot of dis, you  oogly black, idle tog.  You got sore head, und lazy as big bullock.  Out  you vas!\"    He accompanied the fierce words with a sharp kick, and Jack bounded up  and sprang clear over the wagon-box, to stand out on the trampled  ground, staring wildly.    \"Ah, you vait till I gom und get das 'noceros whip, und make you tance,  you lazy tog.  You go take den pferd to water, or you haf no zopper  to-night.  Roon!\"    Dyke stood staring at the change that had come over the Kaffir, who ran  to where the horse was tied, unfastened the rein, and led him off  without a word.    The old trader chuckled.    \"I know whad is der madder mit dose poy.  He is guide well as neffer  vas, und lie und shleep and say he gannod vork a leedle pid.  How game  he do domble und gut den kopf?\"    Dyke coloured.    \"He did not tumble,\" said the boy.  \"I hit him.\"    \"Zo?  Mit dem shdick?\"    \"No,\" faltered Dyke; \"with the barrel of my gun.\"    \"Ach! das ist not goot.  You mide break den gun.  Der whip handle is der  bess.  Why you vas hit him on dem het?\"    \"He would not see to the bullocks.  Almost directly after we had  started--I mean the next day--he got at the meat and ate all there was.\"    \"Ach! yas.  He look as if he had den gros shdomach.  And zo he eat him  all?\"    \"Yes; everything.\"    \"Und what den?\"    \"Then he went to sleep and wasted a whole day, and I had to do  everything, and cut wood for the fire, and watch to keep off the wild  beasts.\"    \"Ach! boor vellow! he vas shleepy, after eat himself so vull.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Und der next day?\"    \"The next day he said it was too soon to start, and that I must go and  shoot something for him to eat, while he kept up a good fire.\"    \"Zo?  He is a glever vellow,\" said the Boer, nodding his head, and with  his eyes twinkling.  \"Und did you go and shoot zom more meat vor den  boor poy?\"    \"No.  I told him he must get up, and help to get the wagon along.\"    \"Und he said he vould not move?\"    \"Yes,\" said Dyke; \"and at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],[0,"The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#18)"],[1,"to stand on the ground, when they  have to come down to rest or to feed.    The birds that I am going to tell you about live wild in the jungle,  and are free to build their nests where they like.    Among the birds we like best, some can _sing_, and some have _bright  feathers_. Those that sing may live near your own homes in the  country--the lark, the thrush, the nightingale, and some others. But  the birds that have bright feathers live generally in other countries.    _Most birds that have lovely voices do not have bright feathers_; and  _most birds that have lovely feathers cannot sing_.    So among animals everything is very fair and just. With us it  sometimes _seems_ different. Some children appear to have all the good  luck, and others all the bad luck. Some children can sing well, and  are also very pretty; others cannot sing at all, and are also plain to  look at. But really things are not quite so unfair; for a child who is  plain, and cannot sing, may still have _some other gift_.    Among birds, those that can sing you may have seen often enough near  your own homes in the country; so I shall now tell you about the birds  that have bright feathers.    Most birds with bright feathers live in hot countries, where it is  _sunny_ almost the whole year. In fact, it is the bright light of the  sun in those countries that gives the colors to the feathers of the  birds, which are as lovely as the colors of the rainbow.    Among the bright birds that live quite wild in the jungles of hot  countries, the most beautiful are the _flamingo_, the _parrot_, the  _cockatoo_, the _peacock_, the _golden pheasant_, the _egret_, and a  few others.      _The Flamingo_    I shall tell you first about the flamingos, as they _live together in  flocks_. They were once found in America, and only a few years ago  there were many flocks of them in Florida, but now there are very few  left in this country. They are now found in Africa and in the  countries of southern Asia; a few are found also in Europe.    This is the way the flamingos live. They choose a place in the jungle  where there is a lake or a river, and build their nests all around the  lake, or by the bank of the river. The nest is just a heap of mud  raised up from the ground, with a hollow at the top where the mother  bird lays her eggs. Sometimes many thousands of flamingos are found  together around one place, which is then called a _flamingo colony_.    [Illustration: A Flamingo Colony  Photograph of a group in the American Museum of Natural History, New York]    The flamingo is a very tall bird, taller than a man when standing up.  The flamingo's legs are long and thin, and the neck is also long. The  long neck and the long legs are very useful to him. He stands in the  water on his legs, which look almost like a pair of stilts; then he  bends down his long neck, dips his beak into the water, and catches a  fish or any other small creature that he can find there. And although  the fish or the small creature sees the flamingo's legs in the water,  it does not run away. Why? Because it mistakes the legs for reeds  growing in the water!    When thousands of flamingos in a colony are standing around the lake  or by the river, where they live, it is a very grand sight from a  distance. The flamingo's feathers are a bright red in color, with  white or pink at the edges; so the thousands of flamingos look like an  army of soldiers with red coats.    In former years, when soldiers sometimes wore red coats, travelers who  happened to come toward a lake in Africa would suddenly see at a  distance an army of soldiers, as they thought, standing by the lake.  What they really saw were the flamingos fishing!    But no traveler could get very near the flamingos, for they have  _sentinels_! I have told you that the wild buffaloes have sentinels to  warn them when an enemy is coming. The flamingos have the same. Their  sentinels stand here and there just outside the place where the others  are fishing; and they keep a lookout all the time. If any enemy  comes, they cry out,    \"Honk! Honk! Honk!\" That means, \"Enemy coming! Fly away!\"    And of course all the flamingos rise up in the air and fly away to a  safe place, till the enemy goes away.    To see a whole flock of flamingos flying in the sky far above one's  head is a most wonderful sight. You have seen a cloud at sunset  shining with lovely tints of red and pink and orange: well, the flock  of flamingos flying in the sky looks something like that. And they all  _keep level_ at the same great height, in _rows and ranks_, just like  an army, as there are thousands and thousands of flamingos in the  flock.    Sometimes the rows and ranks widen out for a few minutes, and fill a  large portion of the sky; then they close up again, and look like one  long banner of red floating in the sky.    And all the time they have sentinels that fly outside the rows and  ranks. They make the pattern in the sky still more beautiful.    My dear children, the more you think of these wonders of the jungle  and of the world, the more you will understand how great and wise is  God, Who made all these things.      _The Parrot_    Another bright bird that lives in the jungle in a flock is the  _parrot_. You know all about him, as you must have often seen him  caged, or chained by the leg to a stand. But he is different in his  happy home in the jungle. He lives in almost every sunny country, and  flies about in flocks.    Wild parrots also make their nests in flocks. In India there is a  deserted city called Amber. Once upon a time a great King lived there  in a lovely marble palace; and the nobles and courtiers also had  lovely marble palaces and mansions.    But one day the King said that they must all leave that city, and go  and build another city. So everybody left the city of Amber, and  to-day it still stands perfect--lovely marble palaces and mansions,  with hundreds of bushes of wild roses growing all around them.    Nobody lives there, except thousands and thousands of wild parrots,  that have made their nests upon the roofs of the palaces, in the  porticoes and balconies, and upon the tops of the marble pillars and  columns.    Just think of that lovely sight! The blue sky above, the red roses on  the ground below, and the white marble palaces between the blue sky  and the red roses; and many thousands of green parrots flitting across  the sky, and from palace to rose bush. Broad bands of red, white, and  blue, with bright flashes of green between them!    Another lovely sight is a flock of wild parrots in the jungle, going  home to roost at sunset. I once saw that sight. Their beautiful green  wings and the patches of yellow on their heads shone amidst the  gorgeous colors of the sunset. And as the parrots flew on and on, many  thousands of them, their own colors mingled with the colors of the  sunset in ever-changing bands. They flew toward the setting sun, and  passed out of sight right into the sun, as it were.    After seeing a sight like that--seeing God's lovely creatures flying  about like happy children at play--who wants to see a bird boxed up in  a cage?      _The Cockatoo_    Another bright bird which you may have seen in a cage, or chained to a  stand, is the _cockatoo_. He is a cousin of the parrot, but much  larger, and far more gorgeous. He has a beautiful _crest_ of red and  orange feathers on his head. His wings are a rosy pink in color; and  he has a long pink and white tail.    In other ways he is very much like the parrot. He lives chiefly in the  countries of southern Asia, and in the islands between Asia and  Australia.      _The Peacock_    And now I come to the most beautiful bird of all, the _peacock_. When  he spreads out his long tail, it looks just like a lady's fan, only  far lovelier than any fan made by men. In color the tail is a kind of  blue and green, with touches of gold and violet, and with \"eyes\"  dotted all over it in shades of many other colors.    The peacock can also close up his tail like a fan. Then the long  feathers of the tail all come together in many folds, and stand out a  yard long behind him.    The peacock is found wild in India and in countries near there, but  has now been brought into America and Europe. You may even have seen  the peacock in the parks and gardens of some cities, where he lives  quite peacefully, at least in the summer months. In the winter, of  course, he must have a warm place indoors.    The peacock is really the Papa bird, and the Mamma bird is called the  _peahen_. She has not the gorgeous tail and the lovely feathers that  he has; so she looks quite plain. You will find that _among animals  the Papas are often much prettier than the Mammas_.    That seems very strange, does it not? Among us, of course, the Mammas  are always prettier than the Papas!    But in another book I shall explain _why_ the Papas among animals are  often prettier than the Mammas.      _The Golden Pheasant_    There is another beautiful bird which has been brought to America, and  now lives here; it is the _golden pheasant_. Once upon a time he lived  only in China; but a few years ago people brought a number of golden  pheasants to America, and put them in the forests of Oregon and  Washington. So now there are many thousands of golden pheasants flying  about and making their nests there.    There are other kinds of pheasants in England and in some parts of  Europe, and these the people shoot and eat. But the golden pheasant is  much too beautiful to eat. His feathers are as lovely as the  sunset--gold and yellow and orange, with blue and deep crimson; and  all these colors are laid out on his feathers in such a beautiful  pattern that to look at him you would think you were dreaming, and not  looking at a real bird.    Man, who toils with his hands, cannot make such lovely colors as those  of the birds of the air, and of the flowers in the fields, which do  not toil.     "]]]
