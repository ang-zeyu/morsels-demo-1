The results of his enterprise produced a strong impression in favor of  Mr. Robinson: he had been thought rash, and even fanatical; his death  had been predicted a hundred times--his success was attributed, half in  jest and half in earnest, to some species of animal enchantment. The  government, at the suggestion of the Committee, acknowledged his  exertions, not only with warm eulogy but substantial rewards. He  received a maximum grant, in the title of which his service to the  public was recorded, and was paid a salary more suited to the office he  filled. Others were also liberally recompensed for their contributions  to his success, of which the merit was more in its conception than in  its detail.    Having shewn the possibility of conciliation, Mr. Robinson declined the  further risk of his life, except on terms which would place his family  beyond the reach of want. The Governor fully met his just claims,  providing pensions for his wife and children, in case of his death, and  promising L1,000,--L300 in hand, and the rest when all should be brought  in. It was understood, that the future government of the aborigines  should be entrusted to his charge, when the mission had realised its  intention. The Governor granted all his requests, and spared no expense  to ensure his success. The task was not accomplished for several years,  but from this time the natives at large rarely appeared, and the  colonists enjoyed that repose to which they so long had been strangers.  His labours were attended with various and unusual perils. It was the  custom of the men belonging to the Circular Head establishment, to  approach the native fires, and destroy all they could not capture. One  night, Robinson, with his black attendants, were on a point of land six  miles from the establishment: the people were attracted by the smoke,  when turning accidentally, he saw seven men cautiously creeping round:  they had levelled their muskets: but for an instant recognition of his  voice, his labours and his life would probably have ended.    Mr. Robinson had learned, that a large party were approaching Arthur  River, on their way to their own country, and returning from a warlike  expedition against those recently captured. He resolved to send four  friendly blacks, and three recent converts, to open a communication with  this tribe: they were to make signals, if successful. Two days after,  the sign was given. On reaching the farther bank, he saw the wild  natives coming towards him with their waddies and spears. He proposed  that they should re-cross with him: they, however, desired him to  remain, promising to hunt for his entertainment. He consented, and made  them presents; but he left his son, and a small party, in the rear. He  was alarmed at night by a friendly native, who being acquainted with one  of the hostile tribe, had learned that it was intended to murder him and  his people. Robinson concealed his knowledge from his companions, lest  their fears should be too powerful to suffer their remaining with him.  The assassins extinguished their own fires, but did not lie down to  sleep: Robinson kept his burning brightly, that he might watch their  movement. They were earnestly chattering, and were trimming their  weapons, while one of their number insisted upon the cruelty of killing  the white man! On Robinson's rising, the whole seized their spears--one  grasped in their right hand, and a bundle in their left. The dogs of  Robinson's party had been secured, and their spears removed; they,  however, escaped, and he was left alone. In a moment, he darted into the  scrub: at this retreat, they seemed struck with astonishment; and  quickly covered by the thicket, their spears did not reach him. On  clearing the scrub, he hastened to Arthur River, and crossed on a  floating tree. At this instant, the natives reached the bank: he was  soon joined by his own friends, and confronted the hostile party, who  stood on the opposite bank flourishing their spears. Robinson cried out,  that he forgave their conduct, and offered them his protection. This  induced a girl and two men to join him; but his situation was perilous,  and having made fires, as if for signals, he hastened away, to deposit  the proselytes in safety.    This tribe continued at large until 1834. They had determined never to  be taken--to subsist upon the _quoib_ (badger), and to perish rather  than yield. Finding Mr. Robinson in pursuit, they endeavoured to elude  his search by false direction sticks. The blacks in his company dreaded  an ambush, and declared that they should all be slain, if they proceeded  further, now that their pursuit was known to the hostile tribe. Mr.  Robinson, however, resolved to persevere, and soothed their fears. The  march was long and harassing, the natives having divided into three  parties, the better to escape. They were captured: eight in February,  three in March, and in April, nine; and were embarked at Circular Head  for Launceston, and thence to Flinders' Island.    The Governor warmly congratulated the colony on its deliverance, but the  numbers that remained were greater than he imagined. The abolition of  martial law was deemed by some to be premature. Twenty were captured in  1834, and seventeen in 1835. Mr. Robinson, after nine months pursuit,  came up with the small relics which were known to be still at large, in  Middlesex Plains, and found one man, four women, and two children: they  had travelled as far as the head of the Derwent. Two men, sent by  Robinson with despatches from the place of their capture, were lost in  the bush, and perished. It was now announced, that no more aborigines  were at large: in this, both Mr. Robinson and the government were  mistaken. Rumours, for several years, were continually stirring, of  blacks fleeing in the distance; of the thin smoke, the native cry, and  other indications of their presence. At length it was proved, that these  were not the ghosts of the departed tribes. In December, 1842, at  Circular Head, seven persons were captured, and rejoined their long  banished countrymen. This remnant consisted of a single family: the  parents about fifty years; the rest of ages from childhood to thirty  years. They were taken by a sealer, whose boat they had pilfered, and  conveyed to Flinders'. They were more than usually intelligent in their  appearance: they did not understand one word of English, and they had  probably retained to the last the primitive manners of their race.    Mr. Robinson was a builder at Hobart Town, his family was large, and  depended on his trade. It detracts nothing from his merit, while it is  honorable to the government, that he was a gainer by successful  humanity. The munificence of the crown, alone prevented a larger  subscription by the people; he had, however, the warm and unanimous  expression of public gratitude.    The character of his mission was supported by his conduct. He went  unarmed, and if the natives approached him at all, they were devoid of  fear and therefore of ferocity. He plunged into the heart of the forest,  assumed the habits of a wanderer, and continued his absence for months  together. He shared the danger of his allies, and confided in their  affection: he encouraged their sports, and so far as could a white man,  without debasement, he became one among them. Hitherto the English had  dealt treacherously, and rarely approached their camps, but to oppress,  to mock, or to destroy them. They now discovered, that all were not  enemies, and kindness was felt more powerfully by contrast. It is said  by Backhouse, that Robinson acted under a sense of religious duty; by  Mann, that he was a fatalist or predestinarian: he was calumniated by  the base and the envious: the ascendancy he acquired over the natives,  the Christian philosopher can easily comprehend. The effect of \"good  will to men,\" is peace on earth. Moral courage, united with generosity,  often overpowers the suspicion and hostility, of even the most  barbarous. The coward dies, while the man of bold spirit dissipates the  clouds of distrust, and wakens in others the confidence he himself  cherishes. Nor is it necessary for the writer to observe, that Divine  Providence gives back often, the \"hazard of their lives,\" to the  resolute in right, or that an omnipotent protector attends the footsteps  of the merciful.    Thus, in their harassing life, parents and children had been divided,  and families had been broken up in melancholy confusion: indeed, they  had ceased to be tribes, and became what they were called--mobs of  natives, composed often of hereditary enemies. Infanticide and distress,  rapid flight, and all the casualties of a protracted conflict,  threatened them with speedy destruction. Had not Robinson appeared, the  last savage, hopeless of peace or safety, would have perished with his  weapon in his hand. It was a great deliverance to this colony, as well  as to the native. From the Windmill-hill at Launceston, whence a wide  and beautiful country is visible, the spectator could discern the site  of twenty aboriginal murders--settlers, servants, and infants; the aged  and the kind had fallen, as well as the base hearted and cruel. It was  something to know, that the fatal hand, which no precaution could  resist, would be raised no more.    It was, indeed, a mournful spectacle: the last Tasmanian quitting the  shores of his ancestors: forty years before, the first settler had  erected his encampment! A change so rapid in the relations of a people  to the soil, will scarcely find a parallel in this world's history; but  that banishment which, if originally contrived, had been an atrocious  crime, was at last an act of mercy--the tardy humanity of Englishmen,  which rescued a remnant, extenuated the dishonor of their cruelty to the  race. As for Mr. Robinson, he enjoyed, not only the bounty of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22886"],[0,"Cinderella in the South: Twenty-Five South African Tales (#18)"],[1,"last  year. The fullness of time had now brought to him the prospect of  another. As he whirled on into Suburbia, he fell to considering  relative prosperities. He set names to the houses he was passing.  No, he wouldn't change with any one of their owners. Not one  stood better just now. Not one was more the man of the moment. He  could give points and a beating to how many!    He drove through a gate and up a drive. He was at home again. His  house had been enlarged and re-decorated since he was last there.  It looked solidly prosperous. Its second floor shouted 'money'  in a country where most houses could boast no first floor.  Its critics might have called its colors harrowing and its  architecture the reverse of inspired, but Julian cared not a  jot for that sort of up-in-the-air criticism. He sat down to  breakfast with a thankful heart, and made himself quite amiable  to Tommy Bates.    Tommy Bates was five years older than Julian, and had acted as  his Secretary these two years past. He had small eyes set in a  rather big pasty face. His goatee beard was trim, but scarcely  pleasing.    Julian got through his letters at breakfast and after, breakfast  with Tommy's help. Amongst the letters was one from Mount  Pleasant Mission enclosing a card. 'Hunter's mad,' said Julian  crossly. He tore up the envelope viciously, but he did not tear  up the card it contained. He placed that in his pocket-book  carefully. Tommy looked at him in interrogation, but Julian was  not communicative.    After they had discussed a business letter or two, and had a  drink together, Julian started for the Club. He made himself  agreeable to one or two, and got a deal of pleasure out of  snubbing another. Then he gathered some important news from a  business acquaintance. It was great news. He wanted time to think  over it. He sent off two or three wires to labor agents and one  to a Native Commissioner.    He must have boys at any cost, and quickly, to develop certain  properties. He    \"... turned an easy wheel  That set sharp racks at work, to pinch and peel.\"    Then he interviewed an agent in an office, and did some very  delicate work indeed in the drafting of a prospectus. He had  earned a drink by then. His brain interested him he was inclined  to self-analysis of a sort its chiaroscuro of limelight effects  and faint nuances indicated rather than expressed. It was good to  be alive to-day, and to pull as many strings as he was pulling.    He did not stop at one drink; over the second, the expert made a  proposition to him. It dazzled him, but he would not give an  answer just then. To-morrow morning would do.    After that he lunched at the Club with Sir Charles Guestling who  was just back from England, and had brought a younger brother out  with him to see the country. It would have been a pleasanter  lunch without that brother, Julian thought at the time. The  brother said nothing offensive, indeed he hardly opened his  mouth, but his eyes embarrassed Julian strangely. He had curious  blue-grey eyes that contrasted with his black hair, and he would  fix Julian with these eyes just as he and Sir Charles were deep  in shares and options and the scarcity of labor. Perhaps it was  that Julian was overwrought with anxieties of success. The eyes  seemed to him clairvoyant, he imagined that they saw more than  they ought to see, when they looked him over, as he made some  highly technical statement. It was extraordinary that a  conventional man about town like Sir Charles should have such a  brother.    After lunch Julian relaxed.    He gave himself the indulgence of a call on Mrs. Puce.    He had put her husband on to a good thing or two a year ago now.  They had been great friends, he and the wife.    To-day he was a little anxious as to how she would receive him.  Things had altered since they last met. 'He had got engaged a  business-like engagement.    But she was very gracious in her welcome. Moreover she was more  decorous this afternoon than he remembered her a few months back.  He told her about his contemplated coup.    'I'll consult planchette for you,' said she. 'Yes, and I'll let  you know to-night.'    She was a pretty woman with rather too high a color. But she grew  pale enough now.    'I forgot, though, it's against my principles,' she said. 'I've  given up lots of things. I'm much more particular.' Something  roused Julian. He spoke masterfully.    'Just this once,' he said, 'Let me know to-night. I may know of  something gilt-edged that I won't keep to myself if I hear to-night  without fail. No, I won't be refused. I want proof of good-will.'    It was a sunny afternoon, with none of that southeast wind which  is the bane of our winter. Julian told his coachman to drive him  up to his new farm. The homestead was about five miles out of  town in the Mount Pleasant direction.    Julian drew out the draft of the prospectus, and began to work  hard at its revision. They had stopped at the house ere he thrust  pencil and paper into his pocket. He stepped out of El Dorado let  himself down, not without a jar, on to more humdrum earth.    The farm-house was an iron shanty newly hammered together. The  bailiff a full-bearded Colonial stood in the front doorway.  Julian gave him a perfunctory handshake. He talked farming  business to him quickly. He was tired, and eager to be through  with it.    They were almost through with it in half an hour. They smoked  their pipes and had coffee on the stoep together.    'About that Mission Church,' said the Bailiff, 'You know the  notice is just up that you gave them last year. The boy that used  to teach there is gone, and the kraal's moving. The building  still stands empty. They don't use it now.'    Julian frowned.    'Let's have a look at it,' he said. 'We can drive round that way  when Bob's inspanned. Meanwhile let's have a drink.'    The Church was very small wattle and daub. It had done three  years' service.    'No value,' pronounced Julian. He was rather angry with such a  mere shed for wasting his valuable time.    'That grass wants burning,' he muttered. 'If you set a light to  it and the Church catches, I shouldn't think there'll be any harm  done.'    'Right,' said the bailiff. Julian stepped inside the building.    'Nothing left,' he said. 'Nothing but this box. You'd better keep  it. They can have it if they send for it.'    'What's inside?'    There were some red and black candlesticks and vases packed away  in the box works of art in their way, but that way was not  Julian's.    'Cheap and nasty,' was his comment. 'Ah! What's that?'    'It was on the Communion Table,' said the bailiff.    Julian took up a clay cross and regarded it curiously.    'A cross with a snake on it!' he exclaimed.    'One of the boys said it meant the Brazen Serpent,' said the  bailiff.    'Holy Moses!' laughed Julian. 'Well I'm going to jump this, it's  quite a curiosity. You may give the boy five bob from me if he  asks what we've done with it.'    'Right,' said the bailiff, and went off with the box to the cart.    Julian looked at the twisted symbol with an intent fascination.  'As Moses lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness,' he murmured  to himself. 'Even so shall the Son of Man be lifted up. How well  I remember preaching outside a kraal, on a boulder under a  flowering kaffir tree, on that very text. I liked preaching that  day more than I did most days. It wasn't half bad. That's Christ  all over that reptile that Worm and no man! The Worm that I tread  on with impunity that's Christ! I expect Hunter might say it  would be better for me if the Worm would turn and bite better for  my eternal interests. Perhaps the Worm will, one of these fine  days. It's a rather clammy notion! The notion would be rather a  nuisance, if I believed in the Worm.'        III. THIS NIGHT        As he drove along the veld twenty minutes after, Julian looked  back at the burning Church. 'What would the Canon Superintendent  say?' he muttered with a grin. A fantastic shape started up from  the grass in front of him. The mules shied at it, and broke into  a gallop. 'Pull up!' he shouted. At last the mules were pulled  up. He sprang out and walked back along the road. The figure  stood stock-still by the road-side, as if waiting to greet him.    When he came near, it came towards him, the figure of an old  native with a ragged grey beard, all hunched up in a blanket.    'Tom.' called Julian to him in his shrill voice, 'You've got to  come down to town tonight. No, you swine, to-morrow won't do.  Tonight before sunset, or there'll be trouble. You know what I  want you to do, what you did last Christmas.' The drive back to  town was uneventful.    Julian sat on his stoep half an hour before dinner, smoking and  pondering. He was anxious about that plunge he meant to make  to-morrow. His philosophy of life, so largely commercial, found room  for a cult or two of superstition. He had consulted Mrs. Puce's  oracle time and time again. He had had recourse to his boy Jim's  father, Tom Nyoka, twice before. He had got him to use for him a  rude and illegal form of divination. He had been helped by it  before, at least so he opined. He might be helped again. He sat  looking at the sun dropping smoothly in a cloudless sky. As he  watched, Jim came out to him to tell him that his father was in  the kitchen. 'I'll come directly, Jim,' he said.    The piccanin was sent off to get water, the kitchen door was  safely locked. The throwing of the bones began, while Julian  watched with understanding eyes. His hard grip of his subjects,  generally, extended to this remote ritual.    To-night the answer seemed to be inconclusive, but as they sought  the answer, a clear sign appeared as it were by the way, and  unsought. Julian was watching haggardly. He snarled a question at  Jim. His cook-boy's big round eyes showed very big and very round  just now. He was watching with painful intentness.    'Yes,' he"]]]
