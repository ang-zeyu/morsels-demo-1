Little, however, for the present, had come of his offers, and it  may be confided to the reader that if the young man delayed to carry  them out it was because he found the labour of providing for his  companion by no means so severe as to require extraneous help. Isabel  had spoken to him very often about \"specimens;\" it was a word that  played a considerable part in her vocabulary; she had given him to  understand that she wished to see English society illustrated by eminent  cases.    \"Well now, there's a specimen,\" he said to her as they walked up from  the riverside and he recognised Lord Warburton.    \"A specimen of what?\" asked the girl.    \"A specimen of an English gentleman.\"    \"Do you mean they're all like him?\"    \"Oh no; they're not all like him.\"    \"He's a favourable specimen then,\" said Isabel; \"because I'm sure he's  nice.\"    \"Yes, he's very nice. And he's very fortunate.\"    The fortunate Lord Warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroine  and hoped she was very well. \"But I needn't ask that,\" he said, \"since  you've been handling the oars.\"    \"I've been rowing a little,\" Isabel answered; \"but how should you know  it?\"    \"Oh, I know he doesn't row; he's too lazy,\" said his lordship,  indicating Ralph Touchett with a laugh.    \"He has a good excuse for his laziness,\" Isabel rejoined, lowering her  voice a little.    \"Ah, he has a good excuse for everything!\" cried Lord Warburton, still  with his sonorous mirth.    \"My excuse for not rowing is that my cousin rows so well,\" said Ralph.  \"She does everything well. She touches nothing that she doesn't adorn!\"    \"It makes one want to be touched, Miss Archer,\" Lord Warburton declared.    \"Be touched in the right sense and you'll never look the worse for  it,\" said Isabel, who, if it pleased her to hear it said that her  accomplishments were numerous, was happily able to reflect that such  complacency was not the indication of a feeble mind, inasmuch as there  were several things in which she excelled. Her desire to think well of  herself had at least the element of humility that it always needed to be  supported by proof.    Lord Warburton not only spent the night at Gardencourt, but he was  persuaded to remain over the second day; and when the second day was  ended he determined to postpone his departure till the morrow. During  this period he addressed many of his remarks to Isabel, who accepted  this evidence of his esteem with a very good grace. She found herself  liking him extremely; the first impression he had made on her had had  weight, but at the end of an evening spent in his society she scarce  fell short of seeing him--though quite without luridity--as a hero  of romance. She retired to rest with a sense of good fortune, with a  quickened consciousness of possible felicities. \"It's very nice to know  two such charming people as those,\" she said, meaning by \"those\" her  cousin and her cousin's friend. It must be added moreover that an  incident had occurred which might have seemed to put her good-humour to  the test. Mr. Touchett went to bed at half-past nine o'clock, but his  wife remained in the drawing-room with the other members of the party.  She prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour, and then,  rising, observed to Isabel that it was time they should bid the  gentlemen good-night. Isabel had as yet no desire to go to bed; the  occasion wore, to her sense, a festive character, and feasts were not  in the habit of terminating so early. So, without further thought, she  replied, very simply--    \"Need I go, dear aunt? I'll come up in half an hour.\"    \"It's impossible I should wait for you,\" Mrs. Touchett answered.    \"Ah, you needn't wait! Ralph will light my candle,\" Isabel gaily  engaged.    \"I'll light your candle; do let me light your candle, Miss Archer!\" Lord  Warburton exclaimed. \"Only I beg it shall not be before midnight.\"    Mrs. Touchett fixed her bright little eyes upon him a moment and  transferred them coldly to her niece. \"You can't stay alone with the  gentlemen. You're not--you're not at your blest Albany, my dear.\"    Isabel rose, blushing. \"I wish I were,\" she said.    \"Oh, I say, mother!\" Ralph broke out.    \"My dear Mrs. Touchett!\" Lord Warburton murmured.    \"I didn't make your country, my lord,\" Mrs. Touchett said majestically.  \"I must take it as I find it.\"    \"Can't I stay with my own cousin?\" Isabel enquired.    \"I'm not aware that Lord Warburton is your cousin.\"    \"Perhaps I had better go to bed!\" the visitor suggested. \"That will  arrange it.\"    Mrs. Touchett gave a little look of despair and sat down again. \"Oh, if  it's necessary I'll stay up till midnight.\"    Ralph meanwhile handed Isabel her candlestick. He had been watching her;  it had seemed to him her temper was involved--an accident that might  be interesting. But if he had expected anything of a flare he was  disappointed, for the girl simply laughed a little, nodded good-night  and withdrew accompanied by her aunt. For himself he was annoyed at his  mother, though he thought she was right. Above-stairs the two ladies  separated at Mrs. Touchett's door. Isabel had said nothing on her way  up.    \"Of course you're vexed at my interfering with you,\" said Mrs. Touchett.    Isabel considered. \"I'm not vexed, but I'm surprised--and a good deal  mystified. Wasn't it proper I should remain in the drawing-room?\"    \"Not in the least. Young girls here--in decent houses--don't sit alone  with the gentlemen late at night.\"    \"You were very right to tell me then,\" said Isabel. \"I don't understand  it, but I'm very glad to know it.    \"I shall always tell you,\" her aunt answered, \"whenever I see you taking  what seems to me too much liberty.\"    \"Pray do; but I don't say I shall always think your remonstrance just.\"    \"Very likely not. You're too fond of your own ways.\"    \"Yes, I think I'm very fond of them. But I always want to know the  things one shouldn't do.\"    \"So as to do them?\" asked her aunt.    \"So as to choose,\" said Isabel.        CHAPTER VIII    As she was devoted to romantic effects Lord Warburton ventured to  express a hope that she would come some day and see his house, a very  curious old place. He extracted from Mrs. Touchett a promise that she  would bring her niece to Lockleigh, and Ralph signified his willingness  to attend the ladies if his father should be able to spare him. Lord  Warburton assured our heroine that in the mean time his sisters would  come and see her. She knew something about his sisters, having sounded  him, during the hours they spent together while he was at Gardencourt,  on many points connected with his family. When Isabel was interested she  asked a great many questions, and as her companion was a copious talker  she urged him on this occasion by no means in vain. He told her he  had four sisters and two brothers and had lost both his parents. The  brothers and sisters were very good people--\"not particularly clever,  you know,\" he said, \"but very decent and pleasant;\" and he was so good  as to hope Miss Archer might know them well. One of the brothers was in  the Church, settled in the family living, that of Lockleigh, which was  a heavy, sprawling parish, and was an excellent fellow in spite of his  thinking differently from himself on every conceivable topic. And then  Lord Warburton mentioned some of the opinions held by his brother, which  were opinions Isabel had often heard expressed and that she supposed to  be entertained by a considerable portion of the human family. Many of  them indeed she supposed she had held herself, till he assured her  she was quite mistaken, that it was really impossible, that she had  doubtless imagined she entertained them, but that she might depend that,  if she thought them over a little, she would find there was nothing  in them. When she answered that she had already thought several of the  questions involved over very attentively he declared that she was only  another example of what he had often been struck with--the fact that,  of all the people in the world, the Americans were the most grossly  superstitious. They were rank Tories and bigots, every one of them;  there were no conservatives like American conservatives. Her uncle and  her cousin were there to prove it; nothing could be more medieval than  many of their views; they had ideas that people in England nowadays were  ashamed to confess to; and they had the impudence moreover, said his  lordship, laughing, to pretend they knew more about the needs and  dangers of this poor dear stupid old England than he who was born in it  and owned a considerable slice of it--the more shame to him! From all of  which Isabel gathered that Lord Warburton was a nobleman of the newest  pattern, a reformer, a radical, a contemner of ancient ways. His other  brother, who was in the army in India, was rather wild and pig-headed  and had not been of much use as yet but to make debts for Warburton to  pay--one of the most precious privileges of an elder brother. \"I don't  think I shall pay any more,\" said her friend; \"he lives a monstrous deal  better than I do, enjoys unheard-of luxuries and thinks himself a much  finer gentleman than I. As I'm a consistent radical I go in only for  equality; I don't go in for the superiority of the younger brothers.\"  Two of his four sisters, the second and fourth, were married, one of  them having done very well, as they said, the other only so-so.  The husband of the elder, Lord Haycock, was a very good fellow, but  unfortunately a horrid Tory; and his wife, like all good English wives,  was worse than her husband. The other had espoused a smallish squire  in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2834"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady — Volume 2 (#18)"],[1,"an offer of a  sort that he had not hitherto entertained, and this result must come of  itself--it was useless to try to force it. Rosier remarked that his own  situation would be in the meanwhile the most uncomfortable in the world,  and Madame Merle assured him that she felt for him. But, as she justly  declared, one couldn't have everything one wanted; she had learned that  lesson for herself. There would be no use in his writing to Gilbert  Osmond, who had charged her to tell him as much. He wished the matter  dropped for a few weeks and would himself write when he should have  anything to communicate that it might please Mr. Rosier to hear.    \"He doesn't like your having spoken to Pansy, Ah, he doesn't like it at  all,\" said Madame Merle.    \"I'm perfectly willing to give him a chance to tell me so!\"    \"If you do that he'll tell you more than you care to hear. Go to the  house, for the next month, as little as possible, and leave the rest to  me.\"    \"As little as possible? Who's to measure the possibility?\"    \"Let me measure it. Go on Thursday evenings with the rest of the world,  but don't go at all at odd times, and don't fret about Pansy. I'll see  that she understands everything. She's a calm little nature; she'll take  it quietly.\"    Edward Rosier fretted about Pansy a good deal, but he did as he was  advised, and awaited another Thursday evening before returning to  Palazzo Roccanera. There had been a party at dinner, so that though he  went early the company was already tolerably numerous. Osmond, as usual,  was in the first room, near the fire, staring straight at the door, so  that, not to be distinctly uncivil, Rosier had to go and speak to him.    \"I'm glad that you can take a hint,\" Pansy's father said, slightly  closing his keen, conscious eyes.    \"I take no hints. But I took a message, as I supposed it to be.\"    \"You took it? Where did you take it?\"    It seemed to poor Rosier he was being insulted, and he waited a moment,  asking himself how much a true lover ought to submit to. \"Madame Merle  gave me, as I understood it, a message from you--to the effect that you  declined to give me the opportunity I desire, the opportunity to explain  my wishes to you.\" And he flattered himself he spoke rather sternly.    \"I don't see what Madame Merle has to do with it. Why did you apply to  Madame Merle?\"    \"I asked her for an opinion--for nothing more. I did so because she had  seemed to me to know you very well.\"    \"She doesn't know me so well as she thinks,\" said Osmond.    \"I'm sorry for that, because she has given me some little ground for  hope.\"    Osmond stared into the fire a moment. \"I set a great price on my  daughter.\"    \"You can't set a higher one than I do. Don't I prove it by wishing to  marry her?\"    \"I wish to marry her very well,\" Osmond went on with a dry impertinence  which, in another mood, poor Rosier would have admired.    \"Of course I pretend she'd marry well in marrying me. She couldn't  marry a man who loves her more--or whom, I may venture to add, she loves  more.\"    \"I'm not bound to accept your theories as to whom my daughter  loves\"--and Osmond looked up with a quick, cold smile.    \"I'm not theorising. Your daughter has spoken.\"    \"Not to me,\" Osmond continued, now bending forward a little and dropping  his eyes to his boot-toes.    \"I have her promise, sir!\" cried Rosier with the sharpness of  exasperation.    As their voices had been pitched very low before, such a note attracted  some attention from the company. Osmond waited till this little movement  had subsided; then he said, all undisturbed: \"I think she has no  recollection of having given it.\"    They had been standing with their faces to the fire, and after he had  uttered these last words the master of the house turned round again  to the room. Before Rosier had time to reply he perceived that a  gentleman--a stranger--had just come in, unannounced, according to the  Roman custom, and was about to present himself to his host. The latter  smiled blandly, but somewhat blankly; the visitor had a handsome face  and a large, fair beard, and was evidently an Englishman.    \"You apparently don't recognise me,\" he said with a smile that expressed  more than Osmond's.    \"Ah yes, now I do. I expected so little to see you.\"    Rosier departed and went in direct pursuit of Pansy. He sought her, as  usual, in the neighbouring room, but he again encountered Mrs. Osmond  in his path. He gave his hostess no greeting--he was too righteously  indignant, but said to her crudely: \"Your husband's awfully  cold-blooded.\"    She gave the same mystical smile he had noticed before. \"You can't  expect every one to be as hot as yourself.\"    \"I don't pretend to be cold, but I'm cool. What has he been doing to his  daughter?\"    \"I've no idea.\"    \"Don't you take any interest?\" Rosier demanded with his sense that she  too was irritating.    For a moment she answered nothing; then, \"No!\" she said abruptly and  with a quickened light in her eyes which directly contradicted the word.    \"Pardon me if I don't believe that. Where's Miss Osmond?\"    \"In the corner, making tea. Please leave her there.\"    Rosier instantly discovered his friend, who had been hidden by  intervening groups. He watched her, but her own attention was entirely  given to her occupation. \"What on earth has he done to her?\" he asked  again imploringly. \"He declares to me she has given me up.\"    \"She has not given you up,\" Isabel said in a low tone and without  looking at him.    \"Ah, thank you for that! Now I'll leave her alone as long as you think  proper!\"    He had hardly spoken when he saw her change colour, and became aware  that Osmond was coming toward her accompanied by the gentleman who had  just entered. He judged the latter, in spite of the advantage of good  looks and evident social experience, a little embarrassed. \"Isabel,\"  said her husband, \"I bring you an old friend.\"    Mrs. Osmond's face, though it wore a smile, was, like her old friend's,  not perfectly confident. \"I'm very happy to see Lord Warburton,\" she  said. Rosier turned away and, now that his talk with her had been  interrupted, felt absolved from the little pledge he had just taken. He  had a quick impression that Mrs. Osmond wouldn't notice what he did.    Isabel in fact, to do him justice, for some time quite ceased to observe  him. She had been startled; she hardly knew if she felt a pleasure or  a pain. Lord Warburton, however, now that he was face to face with her,  was plainly quite sure of his own sense of the matter; though his grey  eyes had still their fine original property of keeping recognition and  attestation strictly sincere. He was \"heavier\" than of yore and looked  older; he stood there very solidly and sensibly.    \"I suppose you didn't expect to see me,\" he said; \"I've but just  arrived. Literally, I only got here this evening. You see I've lost  no time in coming to pay you my respects. I knew you were at home on  Thursdays.\"    \"You see the fame of your Thursdays has spread to England,\" Osmond  remarked to his wife.    \"It's very kind of Lord Warburton to come so soon; we're greatly  flattered,\" Isabel said.    \"Ah well, it's better than stopping in one of those horrible inns,\"  Osmond went on.    \"The hotel seems very good; I think it's the same at which I saw you  four years since. You know it was here in Rome that we first met; it's a  long time ago. Do you remember where I bade you good-bye?\" his lordship  asked of his hostess. \"It was in the Capitol, in the first room.\"    \"I remember that myself,\" said Osmond. \"I was there at the time.\"    \"Yes, I remember you there. I was very sorry to leave Rome--so sorry  that, somehow or other, it became almost a dismal memory, and I've never  cared to come back till to-day. But I knew you were living here,\" her  old friend went on to Isabel, \"and I assure you I've often thought of  you. It must be a charming place to live in,\" he added with a look,  round him, at her established home, in which she might have caught the  dim ghost of his old ruefulness.    \"We should have been glad to see you at any time,\" Osmond observed with  propriety.    \"Thank you very much. I haven't been out of England since then. Till a  month ago I really supposed my travels over.\"    \"I've heard of you from time to time,\" said Isabel, who had already,  with her rare capacity for such inward feats, taken the measure of what  meeting him again meant for her.    \"I hope you've heard no harm. My life has been a remarkably complete  blank.\"    \"Like the good reigns in history,\" Osmond suggested. He appeared to  think his duties as a host now terminated--he had performed them so  conscientiously. Nothing could have been more adequate, more  nicely measured, than his courtesy to his wife's old friend. It  was punctilious, it was explicit, it was everything but natural--a  deficiency which Lord Warburton, who, himself, had on the whole a good  deal of nature, may be supposed to have perceived. \"I'll leave you and  Mrs. Osmond together,\" he added. \"You have reminiscences into which I  don't enter.\"    \"I'm afraid you lose a good deal!\" Lord Warburton called after him, as  he moved away, in a tone which perhaps betrayed overmuch an appreciation  of his generosity. Then the visitor turned on Isabel the deeper, the  deepest, consciousness of his look, which gradually became more serious.  \"I'm really very glad to see you.\"    \"It's very pleasant. You're very kind.\"    \"Do you know that you're changed--a little?\"    She just hesitated. \"Yes--a good deal.\"    \"I don't mean for the worse, of course; and yet how can I say for the  better?\"    \"I think I shall have no scruple in saying that to YOU,\" she bravely  returned.    \"Ah well, for me--it's a long time. It would be a pity there shouldn't  be something to show for it.\" They sat down and she asked him about  his sisters, with other enquiries of a somewhat perfunctory kind. He  answered her"]]]
