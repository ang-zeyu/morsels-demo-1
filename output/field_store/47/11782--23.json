The term  congenital peculiarity, I may remark, is a loose expression and can only  mean a peculiarity apparent when the part affected is nearly or fully  developed: in the Second Part, I shall have to discuss at what period of  the embryonic life connatal peculiarities probably first appear; and I  shall then be able to show from some evidence, that at whatever period  of life a new peculiarity first appears, it tends hereditarily to appear  at a corresponding period{192}. Numerous though slight changes, slowly  supervening in animals during mature life (often, though by no means  always, taking the form of disease), are, as stated in the first  paragraphs, very often hereditary. In plants, again, the buds which  assume a different character from their stock likewise tend to transmit  their new peculiarities. There is not sufficient reason to believe that  either mutilations{193} or changes of form produced by mechanical  pressure, even if continued for hundreds of generations, or that any  changes of structure quickly produced by disease, are inherited; it  would appear as if the tissue of the part affected must slowly and  freely grow into the new form, in order to be inheritable. There is a  very great difference in the hereditary tendency of different  peculiarities, and of the same peculiarity, in different individuals and  species; thus twenty thousand seeds of the weeping ash have been sown  and not one come up true;--out of seventeen seeds of the weeping yew,  nearly all came up true. The ill-formed and almost monstrous \"Niata\"  cattle of S. America and Ancon sheep, both when bred together and when  crossed with other breeds, seem to transmit their peculiarities to their  offspring as truly as the ordinary breeds. I can throw no light on these  differences in the power of hereditary transmission. Breeders believe,  and apparently with good cause, that a peculiarity generally becomes  more firmly implanted after having passed through several generations;  that is if one offspring out of twenty inherits a peculiarity from its  parents, then its descendants will tend to transmit this peculiarity to  a larger proportion than one in twenty; and so on in succeeding  generations. I have said nothing about mental peculiarities being  inheritable for I reserve this subject for a separate chapter.         {191} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 13.         {192} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 86, vi. p. 105.         {193} It is interesting to find that though the author, like his       contemporaries, believed in the inheritance of acquired characters,       he excluded the case of mutilation.      _Causes of Variation._    Attention must here be drawn to an important distinction in the first  origin or appearance of varieties: when we see an animal highly kept  producing offspring with an hereditary tendency to early maturity and  fatness; when we see the wild-duck and Australian dog always becoming,  when bred for one or a few generations in confinement, mottled in their  colours; when we see people living in certain districts or circumstances  becoming subject to an hereditary taint to certain organic diseases, as  consumption or plica polonica,--we naturally attribute such changes to  the direct effect of known or unknown agencies acting for one or more  generations on the parents. It is probable that a multitude of  peculiarities may be thus directly caused by unknown external agencies.  But in breeds, characterized by an extra limb or claw, as in certain  fowls and dogs; by an extra joint in the vertebrae; by the loss of a  part, as the tail; by the substitution of a tuft of feathers for a comb  in certain poultry; and in a multitude of other cases, we can hardly  attribute these peculiarities directly to external influences, but  indirectly to the laws of embryonic growth and of reproduction. When we  see a multitude of varieties (as has often been the case, where a cross  has been carefully guarded against) produced from seeds matured in the  very same capsule{194}, with the male and female principle nourished  from the same roots and necessarily exposed to the same external  influences; we cannot believe that the endless slight differences  between seedling varieties thus produced, can be the effect of any  corresponding difference in their exposure. We are led (as Mueller has  remarked) to the same conclusion, when we see in the same litter,  produced by the same act of conception, animals considerably different.         {194} This corresponds to _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 10, vi. p. 9.    As variation to the degree here alluded to has been observed only in  organic beings under domestication, and in plants amongst those most  highly and long cultivated, we must attribute, in such cases, the  varieties (although the difference between each variety cannot possibly  be attributed to any corresponding difference of exposure in the  parents) to the indirect effects of domestication on the action of the  reproductive system{195}. It would appear as if the reproductive powers  failed in their ordinary function of producing new organic beings  closely like their parents; and as if the entire organization of the  embryo, under domestication, became in a slight degree plastic{196}. We  shall hereafter have occasion to show, that in organic beings, a  considerable change from the natural conditions of life, affects,  independently of their general state of health, in another and  remarkable manner the reproductive system. I may add, judging from the  vast number of new varieties of plants which have been produced in the  same districts and under nearly the same routine of culture, that  probably the indirect effects of domestication in making the  organization plastic, is a much more efficient source of variation than  any direct effect which external causes may have on the colour, texture,  or form of each part. In the few instances in which, as in the  Dahlia{197}, the course of variation has been recorded, it appears that  domestication produces little effect for several generations in  rendering the organization plastic; but afterwards, as if by an  accumulated effect, the original character of the species suddenly gives  way or breaks.         {195} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 8, vi. p. 10.         {196} For _plasticity_ see _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 12, 132.         {197} _Var. under Dom._, Ed. ii. I. p. 393.      _On Selection._    We have hitherto only referred to the first appearance in individuals of  new peculiarities; but to make a race or breed, something more is  generally{198} requisite than such peculiarities (except in the case of  the peculiarities being the direct effect of constantly surrounding  conditions) should be inheritable,--namely the principle of selection,  implying separation. Even in the rare instances of sports, with the  hereditary tendency very strongly implanted, crossing must be prevented  with other breeds, or if not prevented the best characterized of the  half-bred offspring must be carefully selected. Where the external  conditions are constantly tending to give some character, a race  possessing this character will be formed with far greater ease by  selecting and breeding together the individuals most affected. In the  case of the endless slight variations produced by the indirect effects  of domestication on the action of the reproductive system, selection is  indispensable to form races; and when carefully applied, wonderfully  numerous and diverse races can be formed. Selection, though so simple in  theory, is and has been important to a degree which can hardly be  overrated. It requires extreme skill, the results of long practice, in  detecting the slightest difference in the forms of animals, and it  implies some distinct object in view; with these requisites and  patience, the breeder has simply to watch for every the smallest  approach to the desired end, to select such individuals and pair them  with the most suitable forms, and so continue with succeeding  generations. In most cases careful selection and the prevention of  accidental crosses will be necessary for several generations, for in new  breeds there is a strong tendency to vary and especially to revert to  ancestral forms: but in every succeeding generation less care will be  requisite for the breed will become truer; until ultimately only an  occasional individual will require to be separated or destroyed.  Horticulturalists in raising seeds regularly practise this, and call it  \"roguing,\" or destroying the \"rogues\" or false varieties. There is  another and less efficient means of selection amongst animals: namely  repeatedly procuring males with some desirable qualities, and allowing  them and their offspring to breed freely together; and this in the  course of time will affect the whole lot. These principles of selection  have been _methodically_ followed for scarcely a century; but their  high importance is shown by the practical results, and is admitted  in the writings of the most celebrated agriculturalists and  horticulturalists;--I need only name Anderson, Marshall, Bakewell, Coke,  Western, Sebright and Knight.         {198} Selection is here used in the sense of isolation, rather than       as implying the summation of small differences. Professor Henslow       in his _Heredity of Acquired Characters in Plants_, 1908, p. 2,       quotes from Darwin's _Var. under Dom._, Ed. i. II. p. 271, a       passage in which the author, speaking of the direct action of       conditions, says:--\"A new sub-variety would thus be produced       without the aid of selection.\" Darwin certainly did not mean to       imply that such varieties are freed from the action of natural       selection, but merely that a new form may appear without       _summation_ of new characters. Professor Henslow is apparently       unaware that the above passage is omitted in the second edition of       _Var. under Dom._, II. p. 260.

After sending the stolen craft far enough out from  shore to clear points of land that jutted out into the lake, the  leading boat was sent straight ahead.    \"A stern chase and a long chase!\" murmured Mr. Damon.  \"Bless my  rudder, but those fellows are not going to give up easily.\"    \"I guess not,\" murmured Tom.  \"Will you steer for a while, Mr. Damon?\"    \"Of course I will.  If I could get out and pull the boat after me, to  make it go faster, I would.  But as I always lose my breath when I run,  perhaps it's just as well that I stay in here.\"  Tom thought so too,  but his attention was soon given to the engine.  He adjusted the timer  to get if possible a little more speed out of the boat he had borrowed  from Andy, and he paid particular attention to the oiling system.    \"We're going a bit faster!\" called Mr. Damon' encouragingly, \"or else  they're slacking up.\"    Tom peered ahead to see if this was so.  It was hard to judge whether  he was overhauling the ARROW, as it was a stern chase, and that is  always difficult to judge.  But a glimpse along shore showed him that  they were slipping through the water at a faster speed.    \"They're up to something!\" suddenly exclaimed Mr. Damon a moment later.  \"I believe they're going to fire on us, Tom.  They are pointing  something this way.\"    The lad stood up and gazed earnestly at his boat, which seemed to be  slipping away from him so fast.  One of the occupants was in the stern,  aiming some glittering object at those in the RED STREAK.  For a moment  Tom thought it might be a gun.  Then, as the man turned, he saw what it  was.    \"A pair of marine glasses,\" cried the lad.  \"They're trying to make out  who we are.\"    \"I guess they know well enough,\" rejoined Mr. Damon.  \"Can't you go any  faster, Tom?\"    \"I'm afraid not.  But we'll land them, sooner or later.  They can't go  very far in this direction without running ashore and we'll have them.  They're cutting across the lake now.\"    \"They may escape us if it gets dark.  Probably that's what they're  working for.  They want to keep ahead of us until nightfall.\"    The young inventor thought of this too, but there was little he could  do.  The motor was running at top speed.  It could be made to go  faster, Tom knew, with another ignition system, but that was out of the  question now.    The man with the glasses had resumed his seat, and the efforts of the  trio seemed concentrated on the motor of the ARROW.  They, too, wished  to go faster.  But they had not skill enough to accomplish it, and in  about ten minutes, when Tom took another long and careful look to  ascertain if possible whether or not he was overhauling the thieves, he  was delighted to see that the distance between the boats had lessened.    \"We're catching them!  We're creeping up on them!\" cried Mr. Damon.  \"Keep it up, Tom.\"  There was nothing to do, however, save wait.  The  boat ahead had shifted her course somewhat and was now turning in  toward the shore, for the lake was narrow at this point, and abandoning  their evident intention of keeping straight up the lake, the thieves  seemed now bent on something else.    \"I believe they're going to run ashore and get out!\" cried Mr. Damon.    \"If they do, it's just what I want,\" declared the lad.  \"I don't care  for the men.  I want my boat back!\"    The occupants of the ARROW were looking to the rear again, and  one--Happy Harry, Tom thought--shook his fist.    \"Ah, wait until I get hold of you!\" cried Mr. Damon, following his  example.  \"I'll make you wish you'd behaved yourselves, you scoundrels!  Bless my overcoat!  Catch them if you can, Tom.\"    There was now no doubt of the intention of the fleeing ones.  The shore  was looming up ahead and straight for it was headed the ARROW.  Tom  sent Andy's boat in the same direction.  He was rapidly overhauling the  escaping ones now, for they had slowed down the motor.  Three minutes  later the foremost boat grated on the beach of the lake.  The men  leaped out, one of them pausing an instant in the bow.    \"Here, don't you damage my boat!\" cried Tom involuntarily, for the man  seemed to be hammering something.    The fellow leaped over the side, holding something in his hand.    \"There they go!  Catch them!\" yelled Mr. Damon.    \"Let them go!\" answered the lad as the men ran toward the wood.  \"I  want my boat.  I'm afraid they've damaged her.  One of them tore  something from the bow.\"    At the same instant the two companions of the fellow who had paused in  the forward part of the ARROW saw that he had something in his hand.  With yells of rage they dashed at him, but he, shaking his fist at  them, plunged into the bushes and could be heard breaking his way  through, while his companions were in pursuit.    \"They've quarreled among themselves,\" commented Mr. Damon as high and  angry voices could be heard from the woods.  \"There's some mystery  here, Tom.\"    \"I don't doubt it, but my first concern is for my boat.  I want to see  if they have damaged her.\"    Tom had run so closely in shore with the RED STREAK that he had to  reverse to avoid damaging the craft against the bank.  In a mass of  foam he stopped her in time, and then springing ashore, he hurried to  his motor-boat.          CHAPTER XIX    A QUIET CRUISE      \"Have they done any damage?\" asked Mr. Damon as he stood in the bow of  the RED STREAK.    Tom did not answer for a moment.  His trained eye was looking over the  engine.    \"They yanked out the high tension wire instead of stopping the motor  with the switch,\" he answered at length, and then, when he had taken a  look into the compartment where the gasoline tank was, he added: \"And  they've ripped out two more of the braces I put in.  Why in the world  they did that I can't imagine.\"    \"That's evidently what one man had that the others wanted,\" was Mr.  Damon's opinion.    \"Probably,\" agreed Tom.  \"But what could he or they want with wooden  braces?\"    That was a puzzler for Mr. Damon, but he answered:    \"Perhaps they wanted to damage your boat and those two men were mad  because the other got ahead of them.\"    \"Taking out the braces wouldn't do much damage.  I can easily put  others in.  All it would do would be to cause the tank to sag down and  maybe cause a leak in the pipe.  But that would be a queer thing to do.  No, I think there's some mystery that I haven't gotten to the bottom of  yet.  But I'm going to.\"    \"Good!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon.  \"I'll help you.  But can you run your  boat back home?\"    \"Not without fixing it a bit.  I must brace up that tank and put in a  new high-tension wire from the spark coil.  I can do it here, but I'd  rather take it to the shop.  Besides, with two boats to run back, for I  must return Andy's to him, I don't see how I can do it very well unless  you operate one, Mr. Damon.\"    \"Excuse me, but I can't do it.  Bless my slippers, but I would be sure  to run on a rock!  The best plan will be for you to tow your boat and  I'll ride in it and steer.  I can do that much, anyhow.  You can ride  in the RED STREAK.\"    Tom agreed that this would be a good plan.  So, after temporarily  bracing up the tank in the ARROW, it was shoved out into the lake and  attached to Andy's craft.    \"But aren't you going to make a search for those men?\" asked Mr. Damon  when Tom was ready to start back.    \"No, I think it would be useless.  They are well away by this time, and  I don't fancy chasing them through the woods, especially as night is  coming on.  Besides, I won't leave these boats.\"    \"No doubt you are right, but I would like to see them punished, and I  am curious enough to wish to know what object that scoundrel could have  in ripping out the blocks that served as a brace for the tank.\"    \"I feel the same way myself,\" commented the lad, \"especially since this  is the second time that's happened.  But we'll have to wait, I guess.\"    A little later the start back was made, Mr. Damon steering the ARROW  skillfully enough so that it did not drag on the leading boat, in which  Tom rode.  His course took him not far from the lake sanitarium, where  Mr. Duncan, the hunter, had been brought, and desiring to know how the  wounded man was getting on, the youth proposed that they make a halt,  explaining to Mr. Damon his reason.    \"Yes, and while you're about it you'd better telephone your father that  you will join him to-morrow,\" suggested the other.  \"I know what it is  to fret and worry.  You can fix your boat up in time to go to Sandport  to-morrow, can't you?\"    \"Yes, I'm glad you reminded me of it.  I'll telephone from the  sanitarium, if they'll let me.\"    Mr. Duncan was not at the institution, Tom was told, his injury having  healed sufficiently to allow of his being removed to his home.  The  youth readily secured permission to use the telephone, and was soon in  communication with Mr. Swift.  While not telling him all the  occurrences that had delayed him, Tom gave his father and Ned Newton  enough information to explain his absence.  Then the trip to Shopton  was resumed in the two boats.    \"What are you going to do about your automobile?\" asked Tom as they  neared the point where the machine had been left.    \"Never mind about that,\" replied Mr. Damon.  \"It will do it good to  have a night's vacation.  I will go on to your house with you, and  perhaps I can get a train back to my friend's home, so that I can claim  my car.\"    \"Won't you stay all night with me?\" invited the young inventor.  \"I'd  be glad to have you.\"    Mr. Damon agreed, and, Tom putting more speed on the RED STREAK, was  soon opposite his own dock.  The ARROW was run in the boathouse and the  owner hastily told Mrs. Baggert and the engineer what had occurred.  Then he took Andy's boat to Mr. Foger's dock and warmly thanked the  red-haired lad for the use of his craft.    \"Did you find your boat?\" asked Andy eagerly.  \"How did the RED STREAK  run?\"    \"I"]]]
