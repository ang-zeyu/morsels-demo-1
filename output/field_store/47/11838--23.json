Tunis would not do for the point of departure, not only  because it is where pagan Astarte came from when she arrived in Sicily,  but also because it had been Moslem since the seventh century and could  not have been accepted by the people as a Christian seaport.  It is quite  likely that the popularity of the St. Mark legend determined the  selection of Alexandria, which had the advantage also of being on the  coast of the same continent as Tunis.  The storm, the vow and the oxen  are as much common form in legend as the ship; and the next thing that  strikes one is the curious similarity between the alternate domiciles of  the Madonna on the mountain and at Custonaci, and the flittings of Venus  Erycina to and fro between the mountain and Carthage.  If we look upon  the arrival of the picture at Custonaci as involving the transplanting of  a piece of Africa into Sicily, much as an ambassador's house is regarded  as being part of his own country transplanted into a foreign land, we may  then consider that the Madonna, to all intents and purposes, still  travels between the Mountain and Africa, only she now has an easier  journey and avoids actually dwelling among heretics.  In this view the  transporting of her picture backwards and forwards should be looked upon  as the modern version of the feasts of Anagogia and Catagogia.    It is admitted that the picture has, more than once, been placed in the  hands of skilful modern painters whose services have been called in  merely to repair any damage it may have sustained in its  journeyings--they have had nothing to do therefore with the miraculous  preservation of the colouring.  What these experts thought about the date  of the original painting is known only to themselves.  We need not  suppose that they agreed--that would have been indeed a miracle and quite  a fresh departure for a picture with a reputation earned in a different  branch of thaumaturgy.  It does not much matter, however, what they  thought, for experts in matters of art are the victims of such cast-iron  prejudices that if once they fancy they see the influence of Leonardo da  Vinci in a picture and take it into their heads that it comes from  Piedmont, it will be found the most difficult thing in the world to  persuade them that it really was painted in Egypt more than 1000 years  before Giotto.    We shall probably not be far wrong if we assume that something like the  processions of the Personaggi, involving the display of the most  beautiful men and women that could be found, took place on the mountain  in heathen times as part of the cult of the goddess and that, as a  compromise, they were not abolished but accommodated to Christian usages.    Giuseppe Pitre, in his _Feste Patronali in Sicilia_, gives an account of  the procession on the mountain held in 1752.  We are to suppose that the  wickedness of the good people of Eryx had attained to such monstrous  proportions that the whole universe, incited thereto by observing the  anger of God against them, took up arms in the cause of justice.  The  Madonna di Custonaci, however, intervened and saved her chosen people.  It began with the Wrath of God, personified by a warrior armed with  thunderbolts and lightning and setting forth to destroy the mountain.  Then came the Angry Heavens, the Benignant Moon, Mars and Mercury ready  to avenge the outrages done to God; Jove grasping a thunderbolt and about  to hurl it against the comune, Venus anxious to overthrow the city, and  Saturn whetting his golden scythe.  The Sun is obscured, the Four Winds  blow terribly, the Four Elements assist in the work of desolation, the  Four Seasons threaten misery and affliction.  Mount Eryx being convinced  by this display that it is in a great danger, the Genius of the city  appears next, bearing in his hand a figure of the Madonna di Custonaci.  He calls to his assistance Divine Counsel, Devotion, Beneficence and  Piety, and the procession closes with the Guardian Angel.    It must have been a magnificent spectacle.  Many clouds have rested on  Mount Eryx since 1752 and we do not now expose our bedrock of paganism  quite so openly.  This, indeed, but for the slight veneer of  Christianity, might have passed for a downright pagan procession.    In 1894, _L'Aurora Consurgens della Cantica_ was the subject.  There were  twelve figures showing the growth of idolatry and culminating with the  Emperor Julius Caesar who, it will be remembered, accepted worship as a  god; moreover, his death having occurred not half a century before the  birth of Christ, he was naturally followed by the Aurora, symbolizing the  Madonna di Custonaci, and the explanatory pamphlet contained a reference  to the _Song of Solomon_ vi. 10: \"Who is she that looketh forth as the  morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with  banners?\"  After the Aurora came the Rising Sun, Faith, Christian  Civilization, Mount Eryx, Charity and Youth--meaning, probably, that  Christianity will never grow old.  In conclusion came a car with a copy  of the sacred picture and a chorus of youths.    It would seem that the personages formerly appeared on foot, for the  earliest record states that in 1750 they appeared for the first time on  horseback.  In 1897 the subject was _Jael_, and the cavalcade consisted  of eight figures, of whom Deborah, seated in the shade of a palm tree  surrounded with a chorus of damsels, Jael in the tent with Sisera nailed  to the ground, and Triumph, appeared on cars, each of the others being on  horseback and the horses being led by grooms suitably attired.  A  nocturnal procession, whether the figures go on foot, on horseback, or on  cars, does not strike one as being a particularly favourable medium for  the telling of a story.  Nevertheless, by choosing a subject with which  the people are more or less familiar, by emphasizing the climax and by  providing an explanatory pamphlet for 2d., a more satisfactory result is  produced than one would have supposed probable, as I realized when I saw  the procession in August, 1901.  The sacred picture had been on the  mountain since 1893, an unusually long time, and was now to be taken back  to the sanctuary at Custonaci, which, during its absence, had been  beautified \"in the Gothic style.\"  The two events of the Procession and  the Return synchronizing, there was a double festa, lasting four days on  the mountain and four days more at Custonaci.        CHAPTER X--THE UNIVERSAL DELUGE      On the morning of Sunday, 25th August, 1901, every one on Monte San  Giuliano was up early and at 7.30 a brass band began to perambulate the  town to announce that the festa had begun.  At 8.30 the band entered the  Matrice, and before Mass the sacred picture was unveiled, the band  saluting it with a burst of music.  Much may be done in music by allusion  and suggestion.  The service concluded with an extremely graceful  movement in six-eight time, that drove the Madonna out of the mind of at  least one listener and substituted a vision of laughing girls swaying  lightly to the rhythm and singing of the dancing waves whose foam gave  birth to Venus.    When the church emptied we got a better view of the picture.  It is about  6 ft. high by 3 broad, painted in oils on wood prepared with gesso, and  represents a smiling Madonna with the Child at her breast.  She is seated  on a throne in a landscape; two angels hold over her head a massive  golden crown; the Child is crowned also and in His hand are three ears of  corn, to signify fruitfulness; He also holds the keys.  The crowns are  really only half-crowns, but they are gold or silver-gilt, and are  fastened into the wood of the picture.  All round the Madonna's nimbus is  a raised band of gold set with twelve diamond stars, valued at 14,000  lire.  A large diamond earring hangs in her right ear, the only one that  is visible; three large diamond rings are on the fingers of her right  hand and one on the finger of her left which supports the Child, and  suspended all over her skirts is an immense quantity of jewellery.  The  frame is of wood entirely coated with silver, in the form of a  Renaissance doorway with a fluted column on each side and a broken  pediment over the top.  It is almost concealed by the jewellery hung  about it, earrings, chains, necklaces, rings, watches etc.  These are  offerings from the faithful, but what is shown is nothing like all.  There is a large chest containing much more and what has been given this  year is exposed in a separate case.  These valuables constitute the  Madonna's dowry and she carries it with her on her journeys; but some of  the more important articles never leave the mountain; her diamond stars,  for instance, are removed from the picture when it goes down, and their  place is taken by less valuable stars of gold.    In the afternoon there were horse-races outside the Trapani gate on a  fairly level piece of road, and a concert and illumination in the balio  in the evening.    In the course of the day I bought a copy of the explanatory pamphlet.  Its title was _L'Arca Noetica_.  _Simbolo Mariano_.  _Processione  notturna figurativa_ (_I Personaggi_) _in omaggio alla Diva di Custonaci  Celeste Patrone degli Erecini_.  _Ultimo Lunedi d'Agosto_, 1901.  It was  to be a procession of cars, there were to be no figures on horseback.  Having introduced cars, as in _Jael_, to give special importance to the  three points of the story, viz. the opening, the climax, and the  conclusion (or, as the pamphlet expressed it, Causa, Consequenza e  Termine), it was, no doubt, felt that more could be done with them than  with single"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24654"],[0,"Chaldea: From the Earliest Times to the Rise of Assyria (#18)"],[1,"--the  patriarch? And when the family has become too numerous for the original  homestead to hold it, and part of it has to leave it, to found a new  home for itself, it does not, as in the primitive nomadic times, wander  off at random and break all ties, but settles close by on a portion of  the family land, or takes possession of a new piece of ground somewhat  further off, but still within easy reach. In the first case the land  which had been common property gets broken up into lots, which, though  belonging more particularly to the members who separate from the old  stock, are not for that withdrawn from the authority of the patriarch.  There are several homesteads now, which form a village, and, later on,  several villages; but the bond of kindred, of tradition and custom is  religiously preserved, as well as subordination to the common head of  the race, whose power keeps increasing as the community grows in numbers  and extent of land, as the greater complications of relationships,  property, inheritance, demand more laws and a stricter rule,--until he  becomes not so much Father as King. Then naturally come collisions with  neighboring similar settlements, friendly or hostile, which result in  alliances or quarrels, trade or war, and herewith we have the State  complete, with inner organization and foreign policy.    5. This stage of culture, in its higher development, combines with the  fourth and last--city-building, and city-life, when men of the same  race, and conscious of a common origin, but practically strangers to  each other, form settlements on a large scale, which, being enclosed in  walls, become places of refuge and defence, centres of commerce,  industry and government. For, when a community has become very numerous,  with wants multiplied by continual improvements and increasing culture,  each family can no longer make all the things it needs, and a portion of  the population devotes itself to manufacture and arts, occupations best  pursued in cities, while the other goes on cultivating the land and  raising cattle, the two sets of produces--those of nature and those of  the cunning hand and brain--being bartered one for the other, or, when  coin is invented, exchanged through that more convenient medium. In the  same manner, the task of government having become too manifold and  complicated for one man, the former Patriarch, now King, is obliged to  surround himself with assistants--either the elders of the race, or  persons of his own choice,--and send others to different places, to rule  in his name and under his authority. The city in which the King and his  immediate ministers and officers reside, naturally becomes the most  important one--the Capital of the State.    6. It does not follow by any means that a people, once settled, never  stirred from its adopted country. The migratory or wandering instinct  never quite died out--our own love of travelling sufficiently proves  that--and it was no unfrequent occurrence in very ancient times for  large tribes, even portions of nations, to start off again in search of  new homes and to found new cities, compelled thereto either by the  gradual overcrowding of the old country, or by intestine discords, or by  the invasion of new nomadic tribes of a different race who drove the old  settlers before them to take possession of their settlements, massacred  them if they resisted and reduced those who remained to an irksome  subjection. Such invasions, of course, might also be perpetrated with  the same results by regular armies, led by kings and generals from some  other settled and organized country. The alternative between bondage  and emigration must have been frequently offered, and the choice in  favor of the latter was helped not a little by the spirit of adventure  inborn in man, tempted by so many unexplored regions as there were in  those remote ages.    7. Such have been the beginnings of all nations. There can be no other.  And there is one more observation which will scarcely ever prove wrong.  It is that, however far we may go back into the past, the people whom we  find inhabiting any country at the very dawn of tradition, can always be  shown to have come from somewhere else, and not to have been the first  either. Every swarm of nomads or adventurers who either pass through a  country or stop and settle there, always find it occupied already. Now  the older population was hardly ever entirely destroyed or dislodged by  the newcomers. A portion at least remained, as an inferior or subject  race, but in time came to mix with them, mostly in the way of  intermarriage. Then again, if the newcomers were peaceable and there was  room enough--which there generally was in very early times--they would  frequently be suffered to form separate settlements, and dwell in the  land; when they would either remain in a subordinate condition, or, if  they were the finer and better gifted race, they would quickly take the  upper hand, teach the old settlers their own arts and ideas, their  manners and their laws. If the new settlement was effected by conquest,  the arrangement was short and simple: the conquerors, though less  numerous, at once established themselves as masters and formed a ruling  nobility, an aristocracy, while the old owners of the land, those at  least that did not choose to emigrate, became what may be called \"the  common people,\" bound to do service and pay tribute or taxes to their  self-instituted masters. Every country has generally experienced, at  various times, all these modes of invasion, so that each nation may be  said to have been formed gradually, in successive layers, as it were,  and often of very different elements, which either finally amalgamated  or kept apart, according to circumstances.    The early history of Chaldea is a particularly good illustration of all  that has just been said.    FOOTNOTES:    [Y] Genesis, xiii. 7-11.    [Z] Genesis, xxxvi. 6-7.                                         II.                 THE GREAT RACES.--CHAPTER X. OF GENESIS.      1. The Bible says (Genesis xi. 2): \"And it came to pass, as they  journeyed in the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar;  and they dwelt there.\"    Shinar--or, more correctly, Shinear--is what may be called Babylonia  proper, that part of Mesopotamia where Babylon was, and south of it,  almost to the Gulf. \"They\" are descendants of Noah, long after the  Flood. They found the plain and dwelt there, but they did not find the  whole land desert; it had been occupied long before them. How long? For  such remote ages an exact valuation of time in years is not to be  thought of.    2. What people were those whom the descendants of Noah found in the land  to which they came from the East? It seems a simple question, yet no  answer could have been given to it even as lately as fifteen or sixteen  years ago, and when the answer was first suggested by unexpected  discoveries made in the Royal Library at Nineveh, it startled the  discoverers extremely. The only indication on the subject then known was  this, from a Chaldean writer of a late period: \"There was originally at  Babylon\" (i.e., in the land of Babylon, not the city alone) \"a multitude  of men of foreign race who had settled in Chaldea.\" This is told by  Berosus, a learned priest of Babylon, who lived immediately after  Alexander the Great had conquered the country, and when the Greeks ruled  it (somewhat after 300 B.C.). He wrote a history of it from the most  ancient times, in which he gave an account of the oldest traditions  concerning its beginnings. As he wrote his book in Greek, it is probable  that his object was to acquaint the new masters with the history and  religion of the land and people whom they had come to rule.  Unfortunately the work was lost--as so many valuable works have been, as  long as there was no printing, and books existed only in a few  manuscript copies--and we know of it only some short fragments, quoted  by later writers, in whose time Berosus' history was still accessible.  The above lines are contained in one such fragment, and naturally led to  the question: who were these men of foreign race who came from somewhere  else and settled in Chaldea in immemorial times?    3. One thing appears clear: they belonged to none of the races classed  in the Bible as descended from Noah, but probably to one far older,  which had not been included in the Flood.    4. For it begins to be pretty generally understood nowadays that the  Flood may not have been absolutely universal, but have extended over the  countries _which the Hebrews knew_, which made _their_ world, and that  not literally all living beings except those who are reported to have  been in the Ark may have perished in it. From a negligent habit of  reading Chap. VI.-IX. of Genesis without reference to the texts of other  chapters of the same Book, it has become a general habit to understand  it in this literal manner. Yet the evidence is by no means so positive.  The question was considered an open one by profounder students even in  antiquity, and freely discussed both among the Jews themselves and the  Fathers of the early Christian Church. The following are the statements  given in the Book of Genesis; we have only to take them out of their  several places and connect them.    5. When Cain had killed his brother Abel, God banished him from the  _earth_ which had received his brother's blood and laid a curse on him:  \"a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the _earth_\"--using another  word than the first time, one which means earth in general (_erec_), in  opposition to _the_ earth (_adamah_), or fruitful land to the east of  Eden, in which Adam and Eve dwelt after their expulsion. Then Cain went  forth, still further East, and dwelt in a land which was called \"the  land of Nod,\" _i.e._, \"of wandering\" or \"exile.\" He had a son, Enoch,  after whom he named the city which he built,--the"]]]
