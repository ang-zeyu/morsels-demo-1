[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/236"],[0,"The Jungle Book (#18)"],[1," as the shark's egg the tempest flings ashore,       The Beaches of Lukannon shall know their sons no more!          \"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\"         At the hole where he went in       Red-Eye called to Wrinkle-Skin.       Hear what little Red-Eye saith:       \"Nag, come up and dance with death!\"         Eye to eye and head to head,          (Keep the measure, Nag.)       This shall end when one is dead;          (At thy pleasure, Nag.)       Turn for turn and twist for twist--          (Run and hide thee, Nag.)       Hah!  The hooded Death has missed!          (Woe betide thee, Nag!)    This is the story of the great war that Rikki-tikki-tavi fought  single-handed, through the bath-rooms of the big bungalow in Segowlee  cantonment. Darzee, the Tailorbird, helped him, and Chuchundra, the  musk-rat, who never comes out into the middle of the floor, but always  creeps round by the wall, gave him advice, but Rikki-tikki did the real  fighting.    He was a mongoose, rather like a little cat in his fur and his tail, but  quite like a weasel in his head and his habits. His eyes and the end  of his restless nose were pink. He could scratch himself anywhere he  pleased with any leg, front or back, that he chose to use. He could  fluff up his tail till it looked like a bottle brush, and his war cry as  he scuttled through the long grass was: \"Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!\"    One day, a high summer flood washed him out of the burrow where he lived  with his father and mother, and carried him, kicking and clucking, down  a roadside ditch. He found a little wisp of grass floating there, and  clung to it till he lost his senses. When he revived, he was lying in  the hot sun on the middle of a garden path, very draggled indeed, and a  small boy was saying, \"Here's a dead mongoose. Let's have a funeral.\"    \"No,\" said his mother, \"let's take him in and dry him. Perhaps he isn't  really dead.\"    They took him into the house, and a big man picked him up between his  finger and thumb and said he was not dead but half choked. So they  wrapped him in cotton wool, and warmed him over a little fire, and he  opened his eyes and sneezed.    \"Now,\" said the big man (he was an Englishman who had just moved into  the bungalow), \"don't frighten him, and we'll see what he'll do.\"    It is the hardest thing in the world to frighten a mongoose, because  he is eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity. The motto of all  the mongoose family is \"Run and find out,\" and Rikki-tikki was a true  mongoose. He looked at the cotton wool, decided that it was not good to  eat, ran all round the table, sat up and put his fur in order, scratched  himself, and jumped on the small boy's shoulder.    \"Don't be frightened, Teddy,\" said his father. \"That's his way of making  friends.\"    \"Ouch! He's tickling under my chin,\" said Teddy.    Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy's collar and neck, snuffed at  his ear, and climbed down to the floor, where he sat rubbing his nose.    \"Good gracious,\" said Teddy's mother, \"and that's a wild creature! I  suppose he's so tame because we've been kind to him.\"    \"All mongooses are like that,\" said her husband. \"If Teddy doesn't pick  him up by the tail, or try to put him in a cage, he'll run in and out of  the house all day long. Let's give him something to eat.\"    They gave him a little piece of raw meat. Rikki-tikki liked it  immensely, and when it was finished he went out into the veranda and sat  in the sunshine and fluffed up his fur to make it dry to the roots. Then  he felt better.    \"There are more things to find out about in this house,\" he said to  himself, \"than all my family could find out in all their lives. I shall  certainly stay and find out.\"    He spent all that day roaming over the house. He nearly drowned himself  in the bath-tubs, put his nose into the ink on a writing table, and  burned it on the end of the big man's cigar, for he climbed up in the  big man's lap to see how writing was done. At nightfall he ran into  Teddy's nursery to watch how kerosene lamps were lighted, and when Teddy  went to bed Rikki-tikki climbed up too. But he was a restless companion,  because he had to get up and attend to every noise all through the  night, and find out what made it. Teddy's mother and father came in,  the last thing, to look at their boy, and Rikki-tikki was awake on  the pillow. \"I don't like that,\" said Teddy's mother. \"He may bite the  child.\" \"He'll do no such thing,\" said the father. \"Teddy's safer with  that little beast than if he had a bloodhound to watch him. If a snake  came into the nursery now--\"    But Teddy's mother wouldn't think of anything so awful.    Early in the morning Rikki-tikki came to early breakfast in the veranda  riding on Teddy's shoulder, and they gave him banana and some boiled  egg. He sat on all their laps one after the other, because every  well-brought-up mongoose always hopes to be a house mongoose some day  and have rooms to run about in; and Rikki-tikki's mother (she used to  live in the general's house at Segowlee) had carefully told Rikki what  to do if ever he came across white men.    Then Rikki-tikki went out into the garden to see what was to be seen.  It was a large garden, only half cultivated, with bushes, as big as  summer-houses, of Marshal Niel roses, lime and orange trees, clumps of  bamboos, and thickets of high grass. Rikki-tikki licked his lips. \"This  is a splendid hunting-ground,\" he said, and his tail grew bottle-brushy  at the thought of it, and he scuttled up and down the garden, snuffing  here and there till he heard very sorrowful voices in a thorn-bush.    It was Darzee, the Tailorbird, and his wife. They had made a beautiful  nest by pulling two big leaves together and stitching them up the edges  with fibers, and had filled the hollow with cotton and downy fluff. The  nest swayed to and fro, as they sat on the rim and cried.    \"What is the matter?\" asked Rikki-tikki.    \"We are very miserable,\" said Darzee. \"One of our babies fell out of the  nest yesterday and Nag ate him.\"    \"H'm!\" said Rikki-tikki, \"that is very sad--but I am a stranger here.  Who is Nag?\"    Darzee and his wife only cowered down in the nest without answering, for  from the thick grass at the foot of the bush there came a low hiss--a  horrid cold sound that made Rikki-tikki jump back two clear feet. Then  inch by inch out of the grass rose up the head and spread hood of Nag,  the big black cobra, and he was five feet long from tongue to tail.  When he had lifted one-third of himself clear of the ground, he stayed  balancing to and fro exactly as a dandelion tuft balances in the wind,  and he looked at Rikki-tikki with the wicked snake's eyes that never  change their expression, whatever the snake may be thinking of.    \"Who is Nag?\" said he. \"I am Nag. The great God Brahm put his mark upon  all our people, when the first cobra spread his hood to keep the sun off  Brahm as he slept. Look, and be afraid!\"    He spread out his hood more than ever, and Rikki-tikki saw the  spectacle-mark on the back of it that looks exactly like the eye part  of a hook-and-eye fastening. He was afraid for the minute, but it is  impossible for a mongoose to stay frightened for any length of time, and  though Rikki-tikki had never met a live cobra before, his mother had fed  him on dead ones, and he knew that all a grown mongoose's business in  life was to fight and eat snakes. Nag knew that too and, at the bottom  of his cold heart, he was afraid.    \"Well,\" said Rikki-tikki, and his tail began to fluff up again, \"marks  or no marks, do you think it is right for you to eat fledglings out of a  nest?\"    Nag was thinking to himself, and watching the least little movement in  the grass behind Rikki-tikki. He knew that mongooses in the garden  meant death sooner or later for him and his family, but he wanted to get  Rikki-tikki off his guard. So he dropped his head a little, and put it  on one side.    \"Let us talk,\" he said. \"You eat eggs. Why should not I eat birds?\"    \"Behind you! Look behind you!\" sang Darzee.    Rikki-tikki knew better than to waste time in staring. He jumped up in  the air as high as he could go, and just under him whizzed by the head  of Nagaina, Nag's wicked wife. She had crept up behind him as he was  talking, to make an end of him. He heard her savage hiss as the stroke  missed. He came down almost across her back, and if he had been an old  mongoose he would have known that then was the time to break her back  with one bite; but he was afraid of the terrible lashing return stroke  of the cobra. He bit, indeed, but did not bite long enough, and he  jumped clear of the whisking tail, leaving Nagaina torn and angry.    \"Wicked, wicked Darzee!\" said Nag, lashing up as high as he could reach  toward the nest in the thorn-bush. But Darzee had built it out of reach  of snakes, and it only swayed to and fro.    Rikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot (when a mongoose's eyes  grow red, he is angry), and he sat back on his tail and hind legs like a  little kangaroo, and looked all round him, and chattered with rage. But  Nag and Nagaina had disappeared into the grass. When a snake misses its  stroke, it never says anything or gives any sign of what it means to do  next. Rikki-tikki did not care to follow them, for he did not feel sure  that he could manage two snakes at once. So he trotted off to the gravel  path near the house, and sat down to think. It was a serious matter for  him.    If you read the old books of natural history, you will find they say  that when the mongoose fights the snake and happens to get bitten,  he runs off and eats some herb that cures him. That is not true.  The victory is only a matter of quickness of eye and quickness of  foot--snake's blow against mongoose's jump--and as no eye can follow the  motion of a snake's head when it strikes, this makes things much more  wonderful than any magic herb. Rikki-tikki knew he was a young mongoose,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23609"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: Light on Dark Corners (#18)"],[1,"exception arises from  protection from the sun's rays, and opposite colors are often found among  people of one prevailing feature. Thus red-haired Jews are not uncommon,  though the nation in general have dark complexion and hair.    2. THE IMPERISHABLE NATURE OF HAIR.--The imperishable nature of hair arises  from the combination of salt and metals in its composition. In old tombs  and on mummies it has been found in a perfect state, after a lapse of over  two thousand years. There are many curious accounts proving the  indestructibility of the human hair.    3. TUBULAR.--In the human family the hairs are tubular, the tubes being  intersected by partitions, resembling in some degree the cellular tissue of  plants. Their hollowness prevents incumbrance from weight, while their  power of resistance is increased by having their traverse sections rounded  in form.    4. CAUTIONS.--It is ascertained that a full head of hair, beard and  whiskers, are a prevention against colds and consumptions. Occasionally,  however, it is found necessary to remove the hair from the head, in cases  of fever or disease, to stay the inflammatory symptoms, and to relieve the  brain. The head should invariably be kept cool. Close night-caps are  unhealthy, and smoking-caps and coverings for the head within doors are  alike detrimental to the free growth of the hair, weakening it, and causing  it to fall out.    HOW TO BEAUTIFY AND PRESERVE THE HAIR.    1. TO BEAUTIFY THE HAIR.--Keep the head clean, the pores of the skin open,  and the whole circulatory system in a healthy condition, and you will have  no need of bear's grease (alias hog's lard). Where there is a tendency in  the hair to fall off on account of the weakness or sluggishness of the  circulation, or an unhealthy state of the skin, cold water and friction  with a tolerably stiff brush are probably the best remedial agents.    2. BARBER'S SHAMPOOS.--Are very beneficial if properly prepared. They  should not be made too strong. Avoid strong shampoos of any kind. Great  caution should be exercised in this matter. {108}    3. CARE OF THE HAIR.--To keep the hair healthy, keep the head clean. Brush  the scalp well with a stiff brush, while dry. Then wash with castile soap,  and rub into the roots, bay rum, brandy or camphor water. This done twice a  month will prove beneficial. Brush the scalp thoroughly twice a week.  Dampen the hair with soft water at the toilet, and do not use oil.    4. HAIR WASH.--Take one ounce of borax, half an ounce of camphor  powder--these ingredients fine--and dissolve them in one quart of boiling  water. When cool, the solution will be ready for use. Dampen the hair  frequently. This wash is said not only to cleanse and beautify, but to  strengthen the hair, preserve the color and prevent baldness.    ANOTHER EXCELLENT WASH.--The best wash we know for cleansing and softening  the hair is an egg beaten up and rubbed well into the hair, and afterwards  washed out with several washes of warm water.    5. THE ONLY SENSIBLE AND SAFE HAIR OIL.--The following is considered a most  valuable preparation: Take of extract of yellow Peruvian bark, fifteen  grains; extract of rhatany root, eight grains; extract of burdoch root and  oil of nutmegs (fixed), of each two drachms; camphor (dissolve with spirits  of wine), fifteen grains; beef marrow, two ounces; best olive oil, one  ounce; citron juice, half a drachm; aromatic essential oil, as much as  sufficient to render it fragrant; mix and make into an ointment. Two  drachms of bergamot, and a few drops of attar of roses would suffice.    6. HAIR WASH.--A good hair wash is soap and water, and the oftener it is  applied the freer the surface of the head will be from scurf. The  hair-brush should also be kept in requisition morning and evening.    7. TO REMOVE SUPERFLUOUS HAIR.--With those who dislike the use of arsenic,  the following is used for removing superfluous hair from the skin: Lime,  one ounce; carbonate of potash, two ounces; charcoal powder, one drachm.  For use, make it into a paste with a little warm water, and apply it to the  part, previously shaved close. As soon as it has become thoroughly dry, it  may be washed off with a little warm water.    8. COLORING FOR EYELASHES AND EYEBROWS.--In eyelashes the chief element of  beauty consists in their being long and glossy; the eyebrows should be  finely arched and clearly divided from each other. The most innocent  darkener of the brow is the expressed juice of the elderberry, or a burnt  clove. {109}    [Illustration: DISCUSSING THE FASHIONS.]    9. CRIMPING HAIR.--To make the hair stay in crimps, take five cents worth  of gum arabic and add to it just enough boiling water to dissolve it. When  dissolved, add enough alcohol to make it rather thin. Let this stand all  night and then bottle it to prevent the alcohol from evaporating. This put  on the hair at night, after it is done up in papers or pins, will make it  stay in crimp the hottest day, and is perfectly harmless.    10. TO CURL THE HAIR.--There is no preparation that will make naturally  straight hair assume a permanent curl. The following will keep the hair in  curl for a short time: Take borax, two ounces; gum arabic, one drachm; and  hot {110} water, not boiling, one quart; stir, and, as soon as the  ingredients are dissolved, add three tablespoonfuls of strong spirits of  camphor. On retiring to rest, wet the hair with the above liquid, and roll  in twists of paper as usual. Do not disturb the hair until morning, when  untwist and form into ringlets.    11. FOR FALLING OR LOOSENING OF THE HAIR.--Take:      Alcohol, a half pint.    Salt, as much as will dissolve.    Glycerine, a tablespoonful.    Flour of sulphur, teaspoonful. Mix.    Rub on the scalp every morning.    12. TO DARKEN THE HAIR WITHOUT BAD EFFECTS.--Take:      Blue vitriol (powdered), one drachm.    Alcohol, one ounce.    Essence of roses, ten drops.    Rain-water, a half-pint.    Shake together until they are thoroughly dissolved.    13. GRAY HAIR.--There are no known means by which the hair can be prevented  from turning gray, and none which can restore it to its original hue,  except through the process of dyeing. The numerous \"hair color restorers\"  which are advertised are chemical preparations which act in the manner of a  dye or as a paint, and are nearly always dependent for their power on the  presence of lead. This mineral, applied to the skin, for a long time, will  lead to the most disastrous maladies--lead-palsy, lead colic, and other  symptoms of poisoning. It should, therefore, never be used for this  purpose.    [Illustration]           *       *       *       *       *      {111}    How to Cure Pimples or Other Facial Eruptions.    [Illustration]    1. It requires self-denial to get rid of pimples, for persons troubled with  them will persist in eating fat meats and other articles of food calculated  to produce them. Avoid the use of rich gravies, or pastry, or anything of  the kind in excess. Take all the out-door exercise yon can and never  indulge in a late supper. Retire at a reasonable hour, and rise early in  the morning. Sulphur to purify the blood may be taken three times a week--a  thimbleful in a glass of milk before breakfast. It takes some time for the  sulphur to do its work, therefore persevere in its use till the humors, or  pimples, or blotches, disappear. Avoid getting wet while taking the  sulphur.    2. TRY THIS RECIPE: Wash the face twice a day in warm water, and rub dry  with a coarse towel. Then with a soft towel rub in a lotion made of two  ounces of white brandy, one ounce of cologne, and one-half ounce of liquor  potassa. {112} Persons subject to skin eruptions should avoid very salty or  fat food. A dose of Epsom salts occasionally might prove beneficial.    3. Wash the face in a dilution of carbolic acid, allowing one teaspoonful  to a pint of water. This is an excellent and purifying lotion, and may be  used on the most delicate skins. Be careful about letting this wash get  into the eyes.    4. Oil of sweet almonds, one ounce; fluid potash, one drachm. Shake well  together, and then add rose water, one ounce; pure water, six ounces. Mix.  Rub the pimples or blotches for some minutes with a rough towel, and then  dab them with the lotion.    5. Dissolve one ounce of borax, and sponge the face with it every night.  When there are insects, rub on flower of sulphur dry after washing, rub  well and wipe dry; use plenty of castile soap.    6. Dilute corrosive sublimate with oil of almonds. A few days' application  will remove them.           *       *       *       *       *    BLACK-HEADS AND FLESH WORMS.    [Illustration: A Regular Flesh Worm Greatly Magnified.]           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: A HEALTHY COMPLEXION.]    This is a minute little creature, scientifically called _Demodex  folliculorum_, hardly visible to the naked eye, with comparatively large  fore body, a more slender hind body and eight little stumpy processes that  do duty as legs. No specialized head is visible, although of course there  is a mouth orifice. These creatures live on the sweat glands or pores of  the human face, and owing to the appearance that they give to the infested  pores, they are usually known as \"black-heads.\" It is not at all uncommon  to see an otherwise pretty face disfigured by these ugly creatures,  although the insects themselves are nearly transparent white. The black  appearance is really due the accumulation of dirt which gets under the  edges of the skin of the enlarged sweat glands and cannot be removed in the  ordinary way by washing, because the abnormal, hardened secretion of the  gland itself becomes stained. These insects are so lowly organized that it  is almost impossible to satisfactorily deal with them. {113} and they  sometimes cause the continual festering of the skin which they inhabit.
