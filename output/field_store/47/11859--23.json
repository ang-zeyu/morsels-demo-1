These we shall be obliged at first to procure from neighboring  States, or from Europe; but we shall make ourselves independent as  soon as possible. The Jewish entrepreneurs will soon realize the  business prospects that the new country offers.    The army of the Company's officials will gradually introduce more  refined requirements of life. (Officials include officers of our  defensive forces, who will always form about a tenth part of our male  colonists. They will be sufficiently numerous to quell mutinies, for  the majority of our colonists will be peaceably inclined.)    The refined requirements of life introduced by our officials in good  positions will create a correspondingly improved market, which will  continue to better itself. The married man will send for wife and  children, and the single for parents and relatives, as soon as a new  home is established \"over there.\" The Jews who emigrate to the United  States always proceed in this fashion. As soon as one of them has  daily bread and a roof over his head, he sends for his people; for  family ties are strong among us. The Society of Jews and the Jewish  Company will unite in caring for and strengthening the family still  more, not only morally, but materially also. The officials will  receive additional pay on marriage and on the birth of children, for  we need all who are there, and all who will follow.      OTHER CLASSES OF DWELLINGS    I described before only workmen's dwellings built by themselves, and  omitted all mention of other classes of dwellings. These I shall now  touch upon. The Company's architects will build for the poorer classes  of citizens also, being paid in kind or cash; about a hundred  different types of houses will be erected, and, of course, repeated.  These beautiful types will form part of our propaganda. The soundness  of their construction will be guaranteed by the Company, which will,  indeed, gain nothing by selling them to settlers at a fixed sum. And  where will these houses be situated? That will be shown in the section  dealing with Local Groups.    Seeing that the Company does not wish to earn anything on the building  works but only on the land, it will desire as many architects as  possible to build by private contract. This system will increase the  value of landed property, and it will introduce luxury, which serves  many purposes. Luxury encourages arts and industries, paving the way  to a future subdivision of large properties.    Rich Jews who are now obliged carefully to secrete their valuables,  and to hold their dreary banquets behind lowered curtains, will be  able to enjoy their possessions in peace, \"over there.\" If they  cooperate in carrying out this emigration scheme, their capital will  be rehabilitated and will have served to promote an unexampled  undertaking. If in the new settlement rich Jews begin to rebuild their  mansions which are stared at in Europe with such envious eyes, it will  soon become fashionable to live over there in beautiful modern houses.      SOME FORMS OF LIQUIDATION    The Jewish Company is intended to be the receiver and administrator of  the non-transferable goods of the Jews.    Its methods of procedure can be easily imagined in the case of houses  and estates, but what methods will it adopt in the transfer of  businesses?    Here numberless processes may be found practicable, which cannot all  be enlarged on in this outline. But none of them will present any  great difficulties, for in each case the business proprietor, when he  voluntarily decides to emigrate, will settle with the Company's  officers in his district on the most advantageous form of  liquidation.    This will most easily be arranged in the case of small employers, in  whose trades the personal activity of the proprietor is of chief  importance, while goods and organization are a secondary  consideration. The Company will provide a certain field of operation  for the emigrant's personal activity, and will substitute a piece of  ground, with loan of machinery, for his goods. Jews are known to adapt  themselves with remarkable ease to any form of earning a livelihood,  and they will quickly learn to carry on a new industry. In this way a  number of small traders will become small landholders. The Company  will, in fact, be prepared to sustain what appears to be a loss in  taking over the non-transferable property of the poorest emigrants;  for it will thereby induce the free cultivation of tracts of land,  which raises the value of adjacent tracts.    In medium-sized businesses, where goods and organization equal, or  even exceed, in importance, the personal activity of the manager,  whose larger connection is also non-transferable, various forms of  liquidation are possible. Here comes an opportunity for that inner  migration of Christian citizens into positions evacuated by Jews. The  departing Jew will not lose his personal business credit, but will  carry it with him, and make good use of it in a new country to  establish himself. The Jewish Company will open a current bank account  for him. And he can sell the goodwill of his original business, or  hand it over to the control of managers under supervision of the  Company's officials. The managers may rent the business or buy it,  paying for it by instalments. But the Company acts temporarily as  curator for the emigrants, in superintending, through its officers and  lawyers, the administration of their affairs, and seeing to the proper  collection of all payments.    If a Jew cannot sell his business, or entrust it to a proxy or wish to  give up its personal management, he may stay where he is. The Jews who  stay will be none the worse off, for they will be relieved of the  competition of those who leave, and will no longer hear the  Anti-Semitic cry: \"Don't buy from Jews!\"    If the emigrating business proprietor wishes to carry on his old  business in the new country, he can make his arrangements for it from  the very commencement. An example will best illustrate my meaning. The  firm X carries on a large business in dry goods. The head of the firm  wishes to emigrate. He begins by setting up a branch establishment in  his future place of residence, and sending out samples of his stock.  The first poor settlers will be his first customers; these will be  followed by emigrants of a higher class, who require superior goods. X  then sends out newer goods, and eventually ships his newest. The  branch establishment begins to pay while the principal one is still in  existence, so that X ends by having two paying business-houses. He  sells his original business or hands it over to his Christian  representative to manage, and goes off to take charge of the new one.    Another and greater example: Y and Son are large coal-traders, with  mines and factories of their own. How is so huge and complex a  property to be liquidated? The mines and everything connected with  them might, in the first place, be bought up by the State, in which  they are situated. In the second place, the Jewish Company might take  them over, paying for them partly in land, partly in cash. A third  method might be the conversion of \"Y and Son\" into a limited company.  A fourth method might be the continued working of the business under  the original proprietors, who would return at intervals to inspect  their property, as foreigners, and as such, under the protection of  law in every civilized State. All these suggestions are carried out  daily. A fifth and excellent method, and one which might be  particularly profitable, I shall merely indicate, because the existing  examples of its working are at present few, however ready the modern  consciousness may be to adopt them. Y and Son might sell their  enterprise to the collective body of their employees, who would form a  cooperative society, with limited liability, and might perhaps pay the  requisite sum with the help of the State Treasury, which does not  charge high interest.    The employees would then gradually pay off the loan, which either the  Government or the Jewish Company, or even Y and Son, would have  advanced to them.    The Jewish Company will be prepared to conduct the transfer of the  smallest affairs equally with the largest. And whilst the Jews quietly  emigrate and establish their new homes, the Company acts as the great  controlling body, which organizes the departure, takes charge of  deserted possessions, guarantees the proper conduct of the movement  with its own visible and tangible property, and provides permanent  security for those who have already settled.      SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY    What assurance will the Company offer that the abandonment of  countries will not cause their impoverishment and produce economic  crises?    I have already mentioned that honest Anti-Semites, whilst preserving  their independence, will combine with our officials in controlling the  transfer of our estates.    But the State revenues might suffer by the loss of a body of  taxpayers, who, though little appreciated as citizens, are highly  valued in finance. The State should, therefore, receive compensation  for this loss. This we offer indirectly by leaving in the country  businesses which we have built up by means of Jewish acumen and Jewish  industry, by letting our Christian fellow-citizens move into our  evacuated positions, and by this facilitating the rise of numbers of  people to greater prosperity so peaceably and in so unparallelled a  manner. The French Revolution had a somewhat similar result, on a  small scale, but it was brought about by bloodshed on the guillotine  in every province of France, and on the battlefields of Europe.  Moreover, inherited and acquired rights were destroyed, and only  cunning buyers enriched themselves by the purchase of State  properties.    The Jewish Company will offer to the States that come within its  sphere of activity "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2529"],[0,"The Analysis of Mind (#18)"],[1,"ange, and the comparatively  simple nature of the laws governing the simultaneous alterations  of appearances in such cases, that have made it possible to treat a  physical object as one thing, and to overlook the fact that it is a  system of particulars. When a number of people at a theatre watch an  actor, the changes in their several perspectives are so similar and so  closely correlated that all are popularly regarded as identical with  each other and with the changes of the actor himself. So long as all  the changes in the appearances of a body are thus correlated there is no  pressing prima facie need to break up the system of appearances, or to  realize that the body in question is not really one thing but a set of  correlated particulars. It is especially and primarily such changes that  physics deals with, i.e. it deals primarily with processes in which  the unity of a physical object need not be broken up because all its  appearances change simultaneously according to the same law--or, if not  all, at any rate all from places sufficiently near to the object, with  in creasing accuracy as we approach the object.    The changes in appearances of an object which are due to changes in the  intervening medium will not affect, or will affect only very slightly,  the appearances from places close to the object. If the appearances  from sufficiently neighbouring places are either wholly un changed,  or changed to a diminishing extent which has zero for its limit, it  is usually found that the changes can be accounted for by changes in  objects which are between the object in question and the places from  which its appearance has changed appreciably. Thus physics is able  to reduce the laws of most changes with which it deals to changes in  physical objects, and to state most of its fundamental laws in terms of  matter. It is only in those cases in which the unity of the system of  appearances constituting a piece of matter has to be broken up, that the  statement of what is happening cannot be made exclusively in terms of  matter. The whole of psychology, we shall find, is included among such  cases; hence their importance for our purposes.    We can now begin to understand one of the fundamental differences  between physics and psychology. Physics treats as a unit the whole  system of appearances of a piece of matter, whereas psychology is  interested in certain of these appearances themselves. Confining  ourselves for the moment to the psychology of perceptions, we observe  that perceptions are certain of the appearances of physical objects.  From the point of view that we have been hitherto adopting, we  might define them as the appearances of objects at places from which  sense-organs and the suitable parts of the nervous system form part  of the intervening medium. Just as a photographic plate receives a  different impression of a cluster of stars when a telescope is part of  the intervening medium, so a brain receives a different impression  when an eye and an optic nerve are part of the intervening medium.  An impression due to this sort of intervening medium is called a  perception, and is interesting to psychology on its own account, not  merely as one of the set of correlated particulars which is the physical  object of which (as we say) we are having a perception.    We spoke earlier of two ways of classifying particulars. One way  collects together the appearances commonly regarded as a given object  from different places; this is, broadly speaking, the way of physics,  leading to the construction of physical objects as sets of such  appearances. The other way collects together the appearances of  different objects from a given place, the result being what we call a  perspective. In the particular case where the place concerned is a  human brain, the perspective belonging to the place consists of all the  perceptions of a certain man at a given time. Thus classification by  perspectives is relevant to psychology, and is essential in defining  what we mean by one mind.    I do not wish to suggest that the way in which I have been defining  perceptions is the only possible way, or even the best way. It is the  way that arose naturally out of our present topic. But when we approach  psychology from a more introspective standpoint, we have to distinguish  sensations and perceptions, if possible, from other mental occurrences,  if any. We have also to consider the psychological effects of  sensations, as opposed to their physical causes and correlates. These  problems are quite distinct from those with which we have been concerned  in the present lecture, and I shall not deal with them until a later  stage.    It is clear that psychology is concerned essentially with actual  particulars, not merely with systems of particulars. In this it differs  from physics, which, broadly speaking, is concerned with the cases  in which all the particulars which make up one physical object can be  treated as a single causal unit, or rather the particulars which are  sufficiently near to the object of which they are appearances can be so  treated. The laws which physics seeks can, broadly speaking, be stated  by treating such systems of particulars as causal units. The laws which  psychology seeks cannot be so stated, since the particulars themselves  are what interests the psychologist. This is one of the fundamental  differences between physics and psychology; and to make it clear has  been the main purpose of this lecture.    I will conclude with an attempt to give a more precise definition of  a piece of matter. The appearances of a piece of matter from different  places change partly according to intrinsic laws (the laws of  perspective, in the case of visual shape), partly according to the  nature of the intervening medium--fog, blue spectacles, telescopes,  microscopes, sense-organs, etc. As we approach nearer to the object, the  effect of the intervening medium grows less. In a generalized sense,  all the intrinsic laws of change of appearance may be called \"laws  of perspective.\" Given any appearance of an object, we can construct  hypothetically a certain system of appearances to which the appearance  in question would belong if the laws of perspective alone were  concerned. If we construct this hypothetical system for each appearance  of the object in turn, the system corresponding to a given appearance  x will be independent of any distortion due to the medium beyond x, and  will only embody such distortion as is due to the medium between x and  the object. Thus, as the appearance by which our hypothetical system  is defined is moved nearer and nearer to the object, the hypothetical  system of appearances defined by its means embodies less and less of the  effect of the medium. The different sets of appearances resulting from  moving x nearer and nearer to the object will approach to a limiting  set, and this limiting set will be that system of appearances which the  object would present if the laws of perspective alone were operative  and the medium exercised no distorting effect. This limiting set of  appearances may be defined, for purposes of physics, as the piece of  matter concerned.          LECTURE VI. INTROSPECTION    One of the main purposes of these lectures is to give grounds for  the belief that the distinction between mind and matter is not so  fundamental as is commonly supposed. In the preceding lecture I dealt in  outline with the physical side of this problem. I attempted to show  that what we call a material object is not itself a substance, but is  a system of particulars analogous in their nature to sensations, and in  fact often including actual sensations among their number. In this  way the stuff of which physical objects are composed is brought into  relation with the stuff of which part, at least, of our mental life is  composed.    There is, however, a converse task which is equally necessary for our  thesis, and that is, to show that the stuff of our mental life is devoid  of many qualities which it is commonly supposed to have, and is not  possessed of any attributes which make it incapable of forming part of  the world of matter. In the present lecture I shall begin the arguments  for this view.    Corresponding to the supposed duality of matter and mind, there are, in  orthodox psychology, two ways of knowing what exists. One of these, the  way of sensation and external perception, is supposed to furnish data  for our knowledge of matter, the other, called \"introspection,\" is  supposed to furnish data for knowledge of our mental processes. To  common sense, this distinction seems clear and easy. When you see a  friend coming along the street, you acquire knowledge of an external,  physical fact; when you realize that you are glad to meet him, you  acquire knowledge of a mental fact. Your dreams and memories and  thoughts, of which you are often conscious, are mental facts, and the  process by which you become aware of them SEEMS to be different from  sensation. Kant calls it the \"inner sense\"; sometimes it is spoken of  as \"consciousness of self\"; but its commonest name in modern English  psychology is \"introspection.\" It is this supposed method of acquiring  knowledge of our mental processes that I wish to analyse and examine in  this lecture.    I will state at the outset the view which I shall aim at establishing.  I believe that the stuff of our mental life, as opposed to its relations  and structure, consists wholly of sensations and images. Sensations are  connected with matter in the way that I tried to explain in Lecture V,  i.e. each is a member of a system which is a certain physical object.  Images, though they USUALLY have certain characteristics, especially  lack of vividness, that distinguish them from sensations, are not  INVARIABLY so distinguished, and cannot therefore be defined by these  characteristics. Images, as opposed to sensations, can only be"]]]
