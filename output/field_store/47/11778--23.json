Among these is the right to make, or  to refrain from making war.  That was why M. Venizelos in March, 1915,  could not offer the co-operation of Greece in the Dardanelles  enterprise officially without the King's approval, and why the British  Government declined to consider his semi-official communication until  after the King's decision.  Similarly M. Venizelos's proposals for the  dispatch of Entente troops to Salonica in September, so far as that  transaction was carried on above-board, were made subject to the King's  consent.  Of course, if the King exercised this right without advice,  he would be playing the part of an autocrat; but King Constantine  always acted by the advice of the competent authority--namely, the  Chief of the General Staff.  In truth, if anyone tried to play the part  of an autocrat, it was not the King, but M. Venizelos.  His argument  seemed to be that the King should acquiesce in the view {73} which a  lay Minister took of matters military and in decisions which he arrived  at without or in defiance of technical advice.    In this again, M. Venizelos appears to have been inspired by British  example.  We saw during the War the responsibility for its conduct  scattered over twenty-three civil and semi-civil individuals who  consulted the naval and military staffs more or less as and when they  choose, and the result of it in the Gallipoli tragedy.  We saw, too, as  a by-product of this system, experts holding back advice of immense  importance because they knew it would not be well received.  The  Reports of the Dardanelles Commission condemned this method.  But it is  to a precisely similar method that the Greek General Staff objected  with such determination.  \"Venizelos,\" they said, \"does not know  anything about war.  He approaches the King with proposals containing  in them the seeds of national disaster without consulting us, or in  defiance of our advice.  Greece cannot afford to run the risk of  military annihilation; her resources are small, and, once exhausted,  cannot be replaced.\"  The King, relying on the right unquestionably  given to him under the terms of the Constitution, demanded from his  chief military adviser such information as would enable him to judge  wisely from the military point of view any proposal involving  hostilities made by his Premier.  It was this attitude that saved  Greece from the Gallipoli grave in March, and it was the same attitude  that saved her a second time at the present juncture.    But, in fact, at the present juncture the King acted not so much on his  prerogative of deciding about war as on the extreme democratic  principle that such decision belongs to the people, and, finding that  the Party which pushed the country towards war had only a weak  majority, he preferred to place the question before the electorate, to  test beyond the possibility of doubt the attitude of public opinion  towards this new departure.    From whatever point of view we may examine Constantine's behaviour, we  find that nothing could be more unfair than the charge of  unconstitutionalism brought against it.  M. Venizelos himself a little  later, by declaring that he aimed at the \"definite elucidation of the  obligations and rights of the royal authority,\" through a \"new {74}  Constitution,\" [13] unwittingly confessed that the actual Constitution  could not bear his interpretation.  As things stood, the charge might  with a better show of justice be brought against M. Venizelos, who, it  was pointed out, had violated the Constitution by inviting foreign  troops into Greek territory without the necessary Act of Parliament.[14]    Nor should it be forgotten that King Constantine had suffered  grievously both as a Greek and as a general from too punctilious an  observance of parliamentary etiquette by his father in 1897.  At that  date the policy of M. Delyannis was supported by the whole Chamber.  It  was a policy which the late Lord Salisbury very aptly summed up at the  time in the one word, \"strait-waistcoat.\"  But, for lack of a man at  the top strong enough and courageous enough to take the responsibility  of opposing it, it was carried out: Greece rushed headlong into war  with a superior power and was smashed.  Upon King Constantine, then  Crown Prince, had devolved the tragic duty of leading the Greek army to  self-destruction, and it was upon his devoted head that afterwards the  nation visited the criminal levity of M. Delyannis.  Was he to suffer  calmly a repetition of the same catastrophe on an infinitely larger  scale--to see his country trampled under German and Bulgarian  heels--for M. Venizelos's sake?    The practical wisdom and patriotism of the King's conduct cannot be  questioned; but we should guard ourselves against exaggerating its  moral courage.  King Constantine, in turning an inattentive ear to the  warlike outpourings of the People's Chosen, knew perfectly well that he  ran no risk of wounding the people's conscience--just {75} as in  offering to lay the question before the tribunal of public opinion he  knew that he ran no risk of finding it at variance with his own.  He  could afford to act as he did, because the country trusted him  implicitly.  Writing about the middle of November, an English observer  described the situation as follows: \"The people generally are afraid,  waiting and leaving everything to the King. . . .  No one now counts in  Greece but the King.\" [15]  And the absence of any popular murmur at  the rejection of the offer of Cyprus, to anyone who knows how deeply  popular feeling is committed to the ultimate union of that Greek island  with the mother country, speaks for itself.    This does not mean that M. Venizelos had as yet lost caste altogether.  On that fateful 5th of October his reputation as a serious statesman  among his countrymen had received a severe blow.  The idolatrous  admiration with which he had been surrounded until then gave way to  disenchantment, disenchantment to bewilderment, and bewilderment to  dismay: the national prophet from whom fresh miracles had been  expected, was no prophet at all, but a mere mortal--and an uncommonly  fallible mortal at that.  Nevertheless, while many Greeks found it hard  to pardon the Cretan politician for the ruin into which he had so very  nearly precipitated them, there were many others who still remained  under the spell of his personality.  Yet it may well be doubted  whether, had a plebiscite been taken at that moment, he would have got  anything more than a substantial minority.  Fully conscious of the  position, M. Venizelos, in spite of advice from his Entente friends to  stand his ground, boycotted the polls, and the new Parliament, returned  by the elections of 19 December, was a Parliament without an  Opposition.  M. Skouloudis remained at the helm.        [1] _White Book_, No. 45.    [2] _White Book_, No. 46.    [3] See _The Times_, 1 Nov., 1915.    [4] _Orations_, pp. 143-50.  It would hardly be credited, did it not  come out of his own mouth, that the compensations and guarantees which  M. Venizelos thought, or at least said, that Greece could obtain from  Germany in return for her neutrality (a neutrality always benevolent  towards Germany's enemies) exceeded those which the Entente had refused  to grant Greece for her active alliance!    [5] _The Balkan Review_, Dec., 1920, pp. 384, 387; _Orations_, p. 266.    [6] It may not be irrelevant to note that the end of the truce  coincided with the end of the Allies' uncertainty as to whether they  would persist in the Salonica enterprise or give it up.    [7] Art. 31, 37.    [8] Extracts from Minutes in _The Balkan Review_, Dec., 1920, p. 385.  Not for the first time had M. Venizelos expounded that thesis.  Here is  a speech of his on 2/15 May, 1911.    \"We are accused of seeking the destruction of Parliamentary Government,  because we conceive that one of the foundations of the Government is  that those who represent the majority do everything, that it is enough  for them that they represent the majority to impose their will.  But  we, the Liberal Party, entertain an entirely opposite conception both  of the State and the Laws and of the powers of majorities, because  modern progress has proved that humanity cannot prosper so long as the  action of those in authority is not subjected to rules and restrictions  preventing every transgression or violation of justice.  We shall make  the Greeks truly free citizens, enjoying not only the rights which  emanate from the Constitutional ordinances, but also those which  emanate from all the laws.  _We shall defend them against every  tyrannical exercise of Government power derived from a majority._\"    This report is taken from a panegyric on the speaker: _Eleutherios  Venizelos_, by K. K. Kosmides, D.Ph., Athens, 1915, pp. 56-7.  On p. 58  of the same work, occurs another reply by M. Venizelos to a charge of  anti-Parliamentarism, dated 14/27 Nov., 1913.    [9] _The Balkan Review, loc. cit_.  Cp. _The New Europe_, 29 March,  1917, where M. Venizelos expressly admits that \"in February, 1915, the  King's action might be regarded as constitutional.\"    [10] _Orations_, pp. 17-8.  Cp. p. 217.    [11] His opponents then acted as he did now: to avoid exposing their  weakness, they pronounced the dissolution unconstitutional and  boycotted the new elections.  For a full account of these events see  another panegyric: _E. Venizelos: his life--his work_.  By Costa  Kairophyla, Athens, 1915, pp. 73-82.    [12] _Orations_, pp. 12-15.

Venizelos denied in the Chamber and out of it, that he had \"invited\"  the Allies to Salonica.
