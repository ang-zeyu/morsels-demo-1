I think one can see how this development of individuality among the  solitary wasps comes about. May it not be because the wasps are  solitary? They live alone. They have no one to imitate; they are  uninfluenced by their fellows. No community interests override or  check individual whims or peculiarities. The innate tendency to  variation, active in all forms of life, has with them full sway. Among  the social bees or wasps one would not expect to find those  differences between individuals. The members of a colony all appear  alike in habits and in dispositions. Colonies differ, as every  bee-keeper knows, but probably the members composing it differ very  little. The community interests shape all alike. Is it not the same in  a degree among men? Does not solitude bring out a man's peculiarities  and differentiate him from others? The more one lives alone, the more  he becomes unlike his fellows. Hence the original and racy flavor of  woodsmen, pioneers, lone dwellers in Nature's solitudes. Thus isolated  communities develop characteristics of their own. Constant  intercommunication, the friction of travel, of streets, of books, of  newspapers, make us all alike; we are, as it were, all pebbles upon  the same shore, washed by the same waves.    Among the larger of vertebrate animals, I think, one might reasonably  expect to find more individuality among those that are solitary than  among those that are gregarious; more among birds of prey than among  water-fowl, more among foxes than among prairie-dogs, more among  moose than among sheep or buffalo, more among grouse than among quail.  But I do not know that this is true.    Yet among none of these would one expect to find the diversity of  individual types that one finds among men. No two dogs of the same  breed will be found to differ as two men of the same family often  differ. An original fox, or wolf, or bear, or beaver, or crow, or  crab,--that is, one not merely different from his fellows, but  obviously superior to them, differing from them as a master mind  differs from the ordinary mind,--I think, one need not expect to find.  It is quite legitimate for the animal-story writer to make the most of  the individual differences in habits and disposition among the  animals; he has the same latitude any other story writer has, but he  is bound also by the same law of probability, the same need of  fidelity to nature. If he proceed upon the theory that the wild  creatures have as pronounced individuality as men have, that there are  master minds among them, inventors and discoverers of new ways, born  captains and heroes, he will surely \"o'erstep the modesty of nature.\"    The great diversity of character and capacity among men doubtless  arises from their greater and more complex needs, relations, and  aspirations. The animals' needs in comparison are few, their relations  simple, and their aspirations _nil_. One cannot see what could give  rise to the individual types and exceptional endowments that are  often claimed for them. The law of variation, as I have said, would  give rise to differences, but not to a sudden reversal of race habits,  or to animal geniuses.    The law of variation is everywhere operative--less so now, no doubt,  than in the earlier history of organic life on the globe. Yet Nature  is still experimenting in her blind way, and hits upon many curious  differences and departures. But I suppose if the race of man were  exterminated, man would never arise again. I doubt if the law of  evolution could ever again produce him, or any other species of  animal.    This principle of variation was no doubt much more active back in  geologic time, during the early history of animal life upon the globe,  than it is in this late age. And for the reason that animal life was  less adapted to its environment than it is now, the struggle for life  was sharper. Perfect adaptation of any form of life to the conditions  surrounding it seems to check variability. Animal and plant life seem  to vary more in this country than in England because the conditions of  life are harder. The extremes of heat and cold, of wet and dry, are  much greater. It has been found that the eggs of the English sparrow  vary in form and color more in the United States than in Great  Britain. Certain American shells are said to be more variable than the  English. Among our own birds it has been found that the \"migratory  species evince a greater amount of individual variation than do  non-migrating species\" because they are subject to more varying  conditions of food and climate. I think we may say, then, if there  were no struggle for life, if uniformity of temperature and means of  subsistence everywhere prevailed, there would be little or no  variation and no new species would arise. The causes of variation seem  to be the inequality and imperfection of things; the pressure of life  is unequally distributed, and this is one of Nature's ways that  accounts for much that we see about us.                                           VIII                             WHAT DO ANIMALS KNOW?      After the discussion carried on in the foregoing chapters touching the  general subject of animal life and instinct, we are prepared, I think,  to ask with more confidence, What do animals know?    The animals unite such ignorance with such apparent knowledge, such  stupidity with such cleverness, that in our estimate of them we are  likely to rate their wit either too high or too low. With them,  knowledge does not fade into ignorance, as it does in man; the  contrast is like that between night and day, with no twilight between.  So keen one moment, so blind the next!    Think of the ignorance of the horse after all his long association  with man; of the trifling things along the street at which he will  take fright, till he rushes off in a wild panic of fear, endangering  his own neck and the neck of his driver. One would think that if he  had a particle of sense he would know that an old hat or a bit of  paper was harmless. But fear is deeply implanted in his nature; it has  saved the lives of his ancestors countless times, and it is still one  of his ruling passions.    I have known a cow to put her head between two trees in the woods--a  kind of natural stanchion--and not have wit enough to get it out  again, though she could have done so at once by lifting her head to a  horizontal position. But the best instance I know of the grotesque  ignorance of a cow is given by Hamerton in his \"Chapters on Animals.\"  The cow would not \"give down\" her milk unless she had her calf before  her. But her calf had died, so the herdsman took the skin of the calf,  stuffed it with hay, and stood it up before the inconsolable mother.  Instantly she proceeded to lick it and to yield her milk. One day, in  licking it, she ripped open the seams, and out rolled the hay. This  the mother at once proceeded to eat, without any look of surprise or  alarm. She liked hay herself, her acquaintance with it was of long  standing, and what more natural to her than that her calf should turn  out to be made of hay! Yet this very cow that did not know her calf  from a bale of hay would have defended her young against the attack of  a bear or a wolf in the most skillful and heroic manner; and the horse  that was nearly frightened out of its skin by a white stone, or by the  flutter of a piece of newspaper by the roadside, would find its way  back home over a long stretch of country, or find its way to water in  the desert, with a certainty you or I could not approach.    The hen-hawk that the farm-boy finds so difficult to approach with his  gun will yet alight upon his steel trap fastened to the top of a pole  in the fields. The rabbit that can be so easily caught in a snare or  in a box-trap will yet conceal its nest and young in the most  ingenious manner. Where instinct or inherited knowledge can come into  play, the animals are very wise, but new conditions, new problems,  bring out their ignorance.    A college girl told me an incident of a red squirrel she had observed  at her home in Iowa that illustrates how shallow the wit of a squirrel  is when confronted by new conditions. This squirrel carried nuts all  day and stored them in the end of a drainpipe that discharged the  rain-water upon the pavement below. The nuts obeyed the same law that  the rain-water did, and all rolled through the pipe and fell upon the  sidewalk. In the squirrel's experience, and in that of his forbears,  all holes upon the ground were stopped at the far end, or they were  like pockets, and if nuts were put in them they stayed there. A hollow  tube open at both ends, that would not hold nuts--this was too much  for the wit of the squirrel. But how wise he is about the nuts  themselves!    Among the lower animals the ignorance of one is the ignorance of all,  and the knowledge of one is the knowledge of all, in a sense in which  the same is not true among men. Of course some are more stupid than  others of the same species, but probably, on the one hand, there are  no idiots among them, and, on the other, none is preeminent in wit.    Animals take the first step in knowledge--they perceive things and  discriminate between them; but they do not take the second  step--combine them, analyze them, and form concepts and judgments.    So that, whether animals know much or little, I think we are safe in  saying that what they know in the human way, that is, from a process  of reasoning, is very slight.    The animals all have in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3029"],[0,"Real Soldiers of Fortune (#18)"],[1,"stauradora\"  mines from the attacks of Apache Indians from our own Arizona. But there  is evidence that back of Boulbon was the French Government, and that  he was attempting, in his small way, what later was attempted by  Maximilian, backed by a French army corps and Louis Napoleon, to  establish in Mexico an empire under French protection. For both the  filibuster and the emperor the end was the same; to be shot by the  fusillade against a church wall.    In 1852, two years before Boulbon's death, which was the finale to his  second filibustering expedition into Sonora, he wrote to a friend in  Paris: \"Europeans are disturbed by the growth of the United States. And  rightly so. Unless she be dismembered; unless a powerful rival be built  up beside her (_i.e._, France in Mexico), America will become, through  her commerce, her trade, her population, her geographical position upon  two oceans, the inevitable mistress of the world. In ten years Europe  dare not fire a shot without her permission. As I write fifty Americans  prepare to sail for Mexico and go perhaps to victory. _Voila les  Etats-Unis_.\"    These fifty Americans who, in the eyes of Boulbon, threatened the peace  of Europe, were led by the ex-doctor, ex-lawyer, ex-editor, William  Walker, _aged twenty-eight years_. Walker had attempted but had failed  to obtain from the Mexican Government such a contract as the one it had  granted De Boulbon. He accordingly sailed without it, announcing that,  whether the Mexican Government asked him to do so or not, he would see  that the women and children on the border of Mexico and Arizona were  protected from massacre by the Indians. It will be remembered that when  Dr. Jameson raided the Transvaal he also went to protect \"women and  children\" from massacre by the Boers. Walker's explanation of his  expedition, in his own words, is as follows. He writes in the third  person: \"What Walker saw and heard satisfied him that a comparatively  small body of Americans might gain a position on the Sonora frontier  and protect the families on the border from the Indians, and such an  act would be one of humanity whether or not sanctioned by the Mexican  Government. The condition of the upper part of Sonora was at that time,  and still is [he was writing eight years later, in 1860], a disgrace to  the civilization of the continent...and the people of the United States  were more immediately responsible before the world for the Apache  outrages. Northern Sonora was in fact, more under the dominion of the  Apaches than under the laws of Mexico, and the contributions of the  Indians were collected with greater regularity and certainty than the  dues of the tax-gatherers. The state of this region furnished the best  defence for any American aiming to settle there without the formal  consent of Mexico; and, although political changes would certainly have  followed the establishment of a colony, they might be justified by the  plea that any social organization, no matter how secured, is preferable  to that in which individuals and families are altogether at the mercy of  savages.\"    While at the time of Jameson's raid the women and children in danger of  massacre from the Boers were as many as there are snakes in Ireland, at  the time of Walker's raid the women and children were in danger from the  Indians, who as enemies, as Walker soon discovered, were as cruel and as  greatly to be feared as he had described them.    But it was not to save women and children that Walker sought to conquer  the State of Sonora. At the time of his expedition the great question of  slavery was acute; and if in the States next to be admitted to the Union  slavery was to be prohibited, the time had come, so it seemed to  this statesman of twenty-eight years, when the South must extend her  boundaries, and for her slaves find an outlet in fresh territory.  Sonora already joined Arizona. By conquest her territory could easily  be extended to meet Texas. As a matter of fact, strategically the spot  selected by William Walker for the purpose for which he desired it was  almost perfect. Throughout his brief career one must remember that the  spring of all his acts was this dream of an empire where slavery would  be recognized. His mother was a slave-holder. In Tennessee he had been  born and bred surrounded by slaves. His youth and manhood had been spent  in Nashville and New Orleans. He believed as honestly, as fanatically  in the right to hold slaves as did his father in the faith of the  Covenanters. To-day one reads his arguments in favor of slavery with the  most curious interest. His appeal to the humanity of his reader, to his  heart, to his sense of justice, to his fear of God, and to his belief  in the Holy Bible not to abolish slavery, but to continue it, to this  generation is as amusing as the topsy-turvyisms of Gilbert or Shaw. But  to the young man himself slavery was a sacred institution, intended for  the betterment of mankind, a God-given benefit to the black man and a  God-given right of his white master.    White brothers in the South, with perhaps less exalted motives,  contributed funds to fit out Walker's expedition, and in October, 1852,  with forty-five men, he landed at Cape St. Lucas, at the extreme point  of Lower California. Lower California, it must be remembered, in spite  of its name, is not a part of our California, but then was, and still  is, a part of Mexico. The fact that he was at last upon the soil of the  enemy caused Walker to throw off all pretence; and instead of hastening  to protect women and children, he sailed a few miles farther up the  coast to La Paz. With his forty-five followers he raided the town, made  the Governor a prisoner, and established a republic with himself as  President. In a proclamation he declared the people free of the tyranny  of Mexico. They had no desire to be free, but Walker was determined,  and, whether they liked it or not, they woke up to find themselves an  independent republic. A few weeks later, although he had not yet set  foot there, Walker annexed on paper the State of Sonora, and to both  States gave the name of the Republic of Sonora.    As soon as word of this reached San Francisco, his friends busied  themselves in his behalf, and the danger-loving and adventurous of  all lands were enlisted as \"emigrants\" and shipped to him in the bark  _Anita_.    Two months later, in November, 1852, three hundred of these joined  Walker. They were as desperate a band of scoundrels as ever robbed a  sluice, stoned a Chinaman, or shot a \"Greaser.\" When they found that to  command them there was only a boy, they plotted to blow up the  magazine in which the powder was stored, rob the camp, and march north,  supporting themselves by looting the ranches. Walker learned of their  plot, tried the ringleaders by court-martial, and shot them. With a  force as absolutely undisciplined as was his, the act required the most  complete personal courage. That was a quality the men with him could  fully appreciate. They saw they had as a leader one who could fight,  and one who would punish. The majority did not want a leader who would  punish so when Walker called upon those who would follow him to Sonora  to show their hands, only the original forty-five and about forty of  the later recruits remained with him. With less than one hundred men  he started to march up the Peninsula through Lower California, and so  around the Gulf to Sonora.    From the very start the filibusters were overwhelmed with disaster. The  Mexicans, with Indian allies, skulked on the flanks and rear. Men who  in the almost daily encounters were killed fell into the hands of the  Indians, and their bodies were mutilated. Stragglers and deserters were  run to earth and tortured. Those of the filibusters who were wounded  died from lack of medical care. The only instruments they possessed with  which to extract the arrow-heads were probes made from ramrods filed to  a point. Their only food was the cattle they killed on the march. The  army was barefoot, the Cabinet in rags, the President of Sonora wore one  boot and one shoe.    Unable to proceed farther, Walker fell back upon San Vincente, where he  had left the arms and ammunition of the deserters and a rear-guard of  eighteen men. He found not one of these to welcome him. A dozen had  deserted, and the Mexicans had surprised the rest, lassoing them and  torturing them until they died. Walker now had but thirty-five men. To  wait for further re-enforcements from San Francisco, even were he sure  that re-enforcements would come, was impossible. He determined by forced  marches to fight his way to the boundary line of California. Between him  and safety were the Mexican soldiers holding the passes, and the Indians  hiding on his flanks. When within three miles of the boundary line, at  San Diego, Colonel Melendrez, who commanded the Mexican forces, sent in  a flag of truce, and offered, if they would surrender, a safe-conduct to  all of the survivors of the expedition except the chief. But the men who  for one year had fought and starved for Walker, would not, within three  miles of home, abandon him.    Melendrez then begged the commander of the United States troops to order  Walker to surrender. Major McKinstry, who was in command of the United  States Army Post at San Diego, refused. For him to cross the line would  be a violation of neutral territory. On Mexican soil he would neither  embarrass the ex-President of Sonora nor aid him; but he saw to it that  if the filibusters reached American soil, no Mexican or Indian should  follow them.    Accordingly, on the imaginary boundary he drew up his troop, and like  an impartial umpire awaited the result. Hidden behind rocks and cactus,  across the hot, glaring plain, the filibusters could see the American  flag, and the gay, fluttering guidons of the cavalry. The sight gave  them heart for one last desperate spurt."]]]
