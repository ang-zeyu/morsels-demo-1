Ali  hastened to summon what he called a Grand Divan, composed of the chiefs  of both sects, Mussulmans and Christians. There were assembled men of  widely different types, much astonished at finding themselves in  company: the venerable Gabriel, Archbishop of Janina, and uncle of the  unfortunate Euphrosyne, who had been dragged thither by force; Abbas,  the old head of the police, who had presided at the execution of the  Christian martyr; the holy bishop of Velas, still bearing the marks of  the chains with which Ali had loaded him; and Porphyro, Archbishop of  Arta, to whom the turban would have been more becoming than the mitre.    Ashamed of the part he was obliged to play, Ali, after long hesitation,  decided on speaking, and, addressing the Christians, \"O Greeks!\" he  said, \"examine my conduct with unprejudiced minds, and you will see  manifest proofs of the confidence and consideration which I have ever  shown you. What pacha has ever treated you as I have done? Who would  have treated your priests and the objects of your worship with as much  respect? Who else would have conceded the privileges which you enjoy?  for you hold rank in my councils, and both the police and the  administration of my States are in your hands. I do not, however, seek  to deny the evils with which I have afflicted you; but, alas! these  evils have been the result of my enforced obedience to the cruel and  perfidious orders of the Sublime Porte. It is to the Porte that these  wrongs must be attributed, for if my actions be attentively regarded it  will be seen that I only did harm when compelled thereto by the course  of events. Interrogate my actions, they will speak more fully than a  detailed apology.    \"My position with regard to the Suliotes allowed no half-and-half  measures. Having once broken with them, I was obliged either to drive  them from my country or to exterminate them. I understood the political  hatred of the Ottoman Cabinet too well not to know that it would declare  war against me sooner or later, and I knew that resistance would be  impossible, if on one side I had to repel the Ottoman aggression, and on  the other to fight against the formidable Suliotes.    \"I might say the same of the Parganiotes. You know that their town was  the haunt of my enemies, and each time that I appealed to them to change  their ways they answered only with insults and threats. They constantly  aided the Suliotes with whom I was at war; and if at this moment they  still were occupying Parga, you would see them throw open the gates of  Epirus to the forces of the sultan. But all this does not prevent my  being aware that my enemies blame me severely, and indeed I also blame  myself, and deplore the faults which the difficulty of my position has  entailed upon me. Strong in my repentance, I do not hesitate to address  myself to those whom I have most grievously wounded. Thus I have long  since recalled to my service a great number of Suliotes, and those who  have responded to my invitation are occupying important posts near my  person. To complete the reconciliation, I have written to those who are  still in exile, desiring them to return fearlessly to their country, and  I have certain information that this proposal has been everywhere  accepted with enthusiasm. The Suliotes will soon return to their  ancestral houses, and, reunited under my standard, will join me in  combating the Osmanlis, our common enemies.    \"As to the avarice of which I am accused, it seems easily justified by  the constant necessity I was under of satisfying the inordinate cupidity  of the Ottoman ministry, which incessantly made me pay dearly for  tranquillity. This was a personal affair, I acknowledge, and so also is  the accumulation of treasure made in order to support the war, which the  Divan has at length declared.\"    Here Ali ceased, then having caused a barrel full of gold pieces to be  emptied on the floor, he continued:    \"Behold a part of the treasure I have preserved with so much care, and  which has been specially obtained from the Turks, our common enemies: it  is yours. I am now more than ever delighted at being the friend of the  Greeks. Their bravery is a sure earnest of victory, and we will shortly  re-establish the Greek Empire, and drive the Osmanlis across the  Bosphorus. O bishops and priests of Issa the prophet! bless the arms of  the Christians, your children. O primates! I call upon you to defend  your rights, and to rule justly the brave nation associated with my  interests.\"    This discourse produced very different impressions on the Christian  priests and archons. Some replied only by raising looks of despair to  Heaven, others murmured their adhesion. A great number remained  uncertain, not knowing what to decide. The Mirdite chief, he who had  refused to slaughter the Kardikiotes, declared that neither he nor any  Skipetar of the Latin communion would bear arms against their legitimate  sovereign the sultan. But his words were drowned by cries of \"Long live  Ali Pasha! Long live the restorer of liberty!\" uttered by some chiefs of  adventurers and brigands.          CHAPTER IX      Yet next day, May 24th, 1820, Ali addressed a circular letter to his  brothers the Christians, announcing that in future he would consider  them as his most faithful subjects, and that henceforth he remitted the  taxes paid to his own family. He wound up by asking for soldiers, but  the Greeks having learnt the instability of his promises, remained deaf  to his invitations. At the same time he sent messengers to the  Montenegrins and the Servians, inciting them to revolt, and organised  insurrections in Wallachia and Moldavia to the very environs of  Constantinople.    Whilst the Ottoman vassals assembled only in small numbers and very  slowly under their respective standards, every day there collected round  the castle of Janina whole companies of Toxidae, of Tapazetae, and of  Chamidae; so that Ali, knowing that Ismail Pacho Bey had boasted that he  could arrive in sight of Janina without firing a gun, said in his turn  that he would not treat with the Porte until he and his troops should be  within eight leagues of Constantinople.    He had fortified and supplied with munitions of war Ochrida, Avlone,  Cannia, Berat, Cleisoura, Premiti, the port of Panormus, Santi-Quaranta,  Buthrotum, Delvino, Argyro-Castron, Tepelen, Parga, Prevesa, Sderli,  Paramythia, Arta, the post of the Five Wells, Janina and its castles.  These places contained four hundred and twenty cannons of all sizes, for  the most part in bronze, mounted on siege-carriages, and seventy  mortars. Besides these, there were in the castle by the lake,  independently of the guns in position, forty field-pieces, sixty  mountain guns, a number of Congreve rockets, formerly given him by the  English, and an enormous quantity of munitions of war. Finally, he  endeavoured to establish a line of semaphores between Janina and  Prevesa, in order to have prompt news of the Turkish fleet, which was  expected to appear on this coast.    Ali, whose strength seemed to increase with age, saw to everything and  appeared everywhere; sometimes in a litter borne by his Albanians,  sometimes in a carriage raised into a kind of platform, but it was more  frequently on horseback that he appeared among his labourers. Often he  sat on the bastions in the midst of the batteries, and conversed  familiarly with those who surrounded him. He narrated the successes  formerly obtained against the sultan by Kara Bazaklia, Vizier of Scodra,  who, like himself, had been attained with the sentence of deprivation  and excommunication; recounting how the rebel pacha, shut up in his  citadel with seventy-two warriors, had seen collapse at his feet the  united forces of four great provinces of the Ottoman Empire, commanded  by twenty-two pachas, who were almost entirely annihilated in one day by  the Guegues. He reminded them also, of the brilliant victory gained by  Passevend Oglon, Pacha of Widdin, of quite recent memory, which is  celebrated in the warlike songs of the Klephts of Roumelia.    Almost simultaneously, Ali's sons, Mouktar and Veli, arrived at Janina.  Veli had been obliged, or thought himself obliged, to evacuate Lepanto  by superior forces, and brought only discouraging news, especially as to  the wavering fidelity of the Turks. Mouktar, on the contrary, who had  just made a tour of inspection in the Musache, had only noticed  favourable dispositions, and deluded himself with the idea that the  Chaonians, who had taken up arms, had done so in order to aid his  father. He was curiously mistaken, for these tribes hated Ali with a  hatred all the deeper for being compelled to conceal it, and were only  in arms in order to repel aggression.    The advice given by the sons to their father as to the manner of  treating the Mohammedans differed widely in accordance with their  respective opinions. Consequently a violent quarrel arose between them,  ostensibly on account of this dispute, but in reality on the subject of  their father's inheritance, which both equally coveted. Ali had brought  all his treasure to Janina, and thenceforth neither son would leave the  neighbourhood of so excellent a father. They overwhelmed him with marks  of affection, and vowed that the one had left Lepanto, and the other  Berat, only in order to share his danger. Ali was by no means duped by  these protestations, of which he divined the motive only too well, and  though he had never loved his sons, he suffered cruelly in discovering  that he was not beloved by them.    Soon he had other troubles to endure. One of his gunners assassinated a  servant of Vela's, and Ali ordered the murderer to be punished, but when  the sentence was to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27558"],[0,"The 2003 CIA World Factbook (#18)"],[1,"divided the Samoan archipelago.

Economic activity is strongly linked    to the US, with which American Samoa conducts most of its foreign    trade. Tuna fishing and tuna processing plants are the backbone of    the private sector, with canned tuna the primary export. Transfers    from the US Government add substantially to American Samoa's    economic well-being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger    and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its    limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism, a    developing sector, has been held back by the recurring financial    difficulties in East Asia.    GDP:    purchasing power parity - $500 million (2000 est.)
