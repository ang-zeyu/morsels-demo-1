Can no inventor make something to do this--something to lie  in the palm and bring all colours and divisions of colour ready made to  the finger tips so that you might put them down in a revelry of colour  as unconsciously and freely as the improvisator can use the notes on the  piano to express his feeling.    There is more cheering and more gun firing and carriages dash up to the  front of the Shamiana and its white Eastern arches that have done so  much service this week, and Lord Minto drives off. It is most  interesting seeing the Borderer who is to be Warden of the Indian  Peninsula for the next five years. Lady Minto follows, with her  daughters behind her. They stand in the full light, white pillars on  either side and red light filtering through hangings behind. White  uniformed brown-faced officers follow in attendance with glitter of gold  and waving white and red feathers. Lady Minto wears a very big wide hat,  blue and white ostrich feathers under the brim--her daughters are in  bright summery colours; the three drive off in an open carriage with an  honoured soldier.    Then soldier after soldier in gay uniforms with floating white and  scarlet cock feathers drove off in carriages, dog carts, and motors,  followed by city officials, Port trustees, doctors, lawyers, and smaller  wigs till vanishing point might have been marked, I suppose, by the  official artist did the Empire run to such an extravagance. Then more  carriages glittering in gold came up, and old, and fat, young, and thin,  genial, and haughty Indian princes, covered with gold and jewellery, got  in or were helped in, and footmen in gorgeous clothes and bare feet  jumped up in front and behind, and off they went, the big princes  leading with horsemen and drawn swords behind them. Smaller carriages  followed till you come down to victorias with perhaps just one syce.  Then the Poona Horse, beautifully mounted, in dark blue, red, and gold,  with drawn swords rode past at a very quick trot, now and then breaking  into a canter with a fine jingle and dust that made almost the best part  of the show.       .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .    I can't say I enjoy this damp warm weather here. It feels all right in  the sun out of doors, but indoors after dark and in draughts from  punkahs it is horrid. I'd now give a considerable sum for one whole day  of twenty-four hours clear Arctic or Antarctic sunny air and snow; one  would feel dry then, and lose the cold and fever that sticks to one  here. The Turkish bath is the only place you can get really dry in; at  one hundred and fifty in the hot room you feel more comfortable than  outside at eighty-two. The Turkish bath in the hotel is very nicely  fitted up, but the native masseur wasn't a pleasing experience, his weak  chocolate-coloured hands gave me the sensation of the touch of a  middling strong eel; his lean, lithe figure and the charms round his  neck, and grey hair died brick-red I expect to see again in dreams--a  crease in his teeth and venom in his evil eye.    It is curious that though you do not see any sign of this dampness in  the air either by day or night, whenever the search lights from the war  ships are turned on; you see what appear to be clouds of vapour drifting  across the path of light.    At night we drove to Malabar Hill to the new Viceroy's reception, and it  was all pretty much the same as going to the reception given by their  Royal Highnesses. The air damp, hot, and dusty, and for a long way heavy  with the smell of roasting bodies, and this time inscriptions across the  lamplit road were changed to \"God bless our new Viceroy;\" but we had the  same waiting outside Government House, met the same people and heard  much the same talk about Lord Curzon's Byculla speech and about this one  and the other. \"So and so is looking well isn't he?\" \"Yes, yes--ha,  ha--laying it on a bit, isn't he! Must be a stone heavier since his  leave--takes his fences though they say like a man. Oh! excellent  speech. They must be tired--poor people--hear they were very pleased  with our decorations. Well, you know they weren't bad, were they?\" Of  course the \"excellent speech\" was Lord Curzon's farewell, and \"They\"  stands for their Royal Highnesses.    I noticed some Parsi ladies rather better looking than I had already  seen. One was really beautiful, allowing a decimal point off her nose.  This beauty moved briskly and firmly and had eyes to see and be seen.  Many of them have slightly hen-like expressions and wear glasses and  carry their shoulders too high. As they are the only native women who  appear in public they naturally draw your attention. The Hindoos and  Mohammedans shut their women up at home and glower on yours; but the  Parsi goes about with his wife and daughters with him in public, and  therefore enlists your sympathy. These Parsis were driven from Persia in  pre-Mohammedan times by religious persecution. I suppose their belief  was akin to our old religion which the masterful Columba rang out of  Iona. I don't think I have seen any men on apparently such friendly  relations with their women and children. You see them everywhere in  Bombay, often in family groups, their expressions beyond being clever,  perhaps shrewd, are essentially those of gentlemen and gentlewomen.[6]  The only other native women I have seen have their mouths so horribly  red with betel nut and red saliva that you dare not look at them twice,  so perhaps it is as well that their absence is so conspicuous.    [6] The strength of intellectual capacity added to the material wealth  which is possessed by this community have given it abnormal prominence,  the measure of which may be estimated by the fact that out of a total of  287,000,000 inhabitants of India, the Parsis do not number even  one-tenth of a million. _See_ Sir Thomas Holdich's \"India.\"    I need hardly say that Mrs H. and G. were the most beautifully dressed  ladies in the crowd, and made the most perfect curtseys, and H. and I  the most elegant bows to the Viceroy and Vicereine. They stood on a  dais, and as we passed in file we were introduced, and the Viceroy  bobbed and Lady Minto looked and smiled a little, just as if she knew  your name and about you and saw more than men as trees walking, and we  bowed and went on, thinking it nice to see people in so great and  responsible a position attending to the little details so well, not  forgetting that many littles make a mickle, and that those two servants  of the Empire have been standing doing this for half an hour, and will  still have to go on for an hour at least in this very tiring Bombay heat  and crowd, and after a P. & O. voyage and landing! Their total effort  for all the ceremonies of the day before, and years to come, rather  appalled me to think of. Bravo! Public Servants, who work for honour and  the Empire; how will the Socialist fill your places when he is on top.  As before, gorgeously apparelled scarlet turbaned waiters gave us  champagne, and native princes hemmed the tables for it, and chocolates.  Here is a little picture of what I remember--you may suppose some of the  figures represent our party after getting over the bow and into the  straight for the cup. We then wandered about, and admired the uniforms  of the governor's body guard, tall native soldiers standing round about  the passages with huge turbans and beards, blue tunics, white breeches,  and tall black boots, all straight and stiff as their lances, and  barring their roving black eyes, as motionless. From a verandah opposite  the Viceroy, we watched the new comers making their bows; ladies,  soldiers, sailors, civilians, single or married passed, and never were  two bows or curtseys absolutely alike, nor were two walks, but the  Viceroy's bow and Lady Minto's pleasant smile and half look of  recognition were equally cordial to all.    [Illustration: A Reception in Government House, Bombay.]    Our departure--hours to wait again for our carriage. H. stood-by in  front, waiting for our number to be shouted; fortune drove me wandering  up the drive with a Government House cheroot, too fagged to speak to  people, and lo and behold! our carriage driver and syce, asleep in a  by-way. So I brought it along and sung out 658! 658! and away we all got  hours sooner than might have been.    The road is full of carriages, gharries, and dog carts.  Occupants--officers, sailors, and soldiers in batches, alone or with  ladies; white shirts and skirts gleam green in the moonlight--the  road--dusty, stuffy, and the pace go-as-you-please; past a lamplit  bungalow in the shadows of trees and out into the open again and  moonlight and dust--past a motor by the roadside, its owner, in court  dress, sweating at its works--dust, moonlight, and black silk--a  Whistler by Jove! Now we pass a slow going gharry, and now two young  hatless soldiers in a high dog cart pass us under the trees, downhill at  a canter, an inch between us, and half an inch between their off wheel  and the edge of the road, and the sea ten feet beneath. Then along the  lines of tents, with their curtains open and occupants going to bed....  We too must experience that tent life, but not in town if we can help  it.    By all that's lucky the lift works still! That grand stairway is a  climb, in the sma' hours--a pipe and a chat and this line in this  journal, and under the mosquito curtains to sleep--I hope till past time  for church; all the common prey of the grey mosquito, viceroy, public  servant, private gentleman alike.    Yesterday being Sunday we had a day of rest and did no manner of  work--only painted and wrote up my journal, and in the late afternoon G.  and I drove down to Colaba, the"]]]
