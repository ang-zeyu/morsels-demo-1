[9] It is probable that some of the double Moro mats which will be  described under the heading \"Pandan Straws\" are woven from buri straw.    [10] Due to the efforts of Elmer D. Merrill and A. D. E. Elmer,  Botanists of Manila, aided by Prof. Martelli, of Florence, Italy,  our knowledge of Philippine pandans has been greatly broadened. It is  hoped that interested persons into whose hands this paper may come will  help to extend it by sending specimens of pandans for identification  to the Bureau of Education, Manila. Such specimens should consist of  the ripe fruit and of at least two full-grown leaves from which no  spines or tips have been removed, and which have been cut as close  as possible to the stem.    [11] Bulletin No. 33, Bureau of Education. Journal of Science, Manila,  Vol. VI, Sec. C, No. 2.    [12] To settle, if possible, the question of whether sabutan flowers  and fruits, inquiries and investigations on the ground were made  in Tanay and Pililla by a representative of the General Office of  the Bureau of Education. The people interviewed in these towns were  positive in their statements that they had never seen the fruit of  this pandan though they did remember seeing the flower. Every possible  effort was made to get accurate, reliable information. An old man was  engaged as guide and a male inflorescence of sabutan was found in a  patch located on a hillside, under the shade of trees and surrounded by  considerable underbrush. The patch, according to the statement of the  old man was older than he could remember; the age of the guide was,  perhaps, between sixty and seventy years. The flowers were odorous  and covered with small brown insects almost hiding the inflorescence.    [13] Plain double pandan mats, the material of which resembles sabutan,  are imported from Singapore and sold by Chinese storekeepers in  Manila in large quantities. They are roughly made and the fact that  they are double permits the unfinished edges to be turned under and  sewed down with coarse red cotton twine. They sell for a little less  than the plain, single, Tanay sabutan mats with finished edges.    [14] It is very difficult to obtain definite information with exact  figures. These statements were made by a woman expert in weaving mats,  and owing to the frank answers to the questions put, her information  seems more reliable than that of the usual weaver interviewed. Other  persons state that from two to six leaves are taken from a plant  every month.    [15] Three liters equal 1 ganta.    [16] Sabutan lends itself easily to the fabrication of pocketbooks  useful as purses, card-cases or cigarette-cases. From it can also be  made very pretty, strong, durable and useful handbags. The weaving  of both of these articles has been taken up in the schools of Tanay,  but it is not as yet commercial in the town. Sets consisting of a  handbag and a pocketbook in the same color and design are attractive.    [17] Sabutan suckers may be purchased from several firms in Manila at  P5 per hundred, freight prepaid. In shipping, the plants are packed  in baskets so that they can be easily handled. It is believed by  persons who have received shipments from this source that the plants  will remain in good condition out of the ground for a week or more  during shipment. Hence it is not advisable for places more remote  than one week from Manila to order any of these plants. For further  information see Circular No. 82, s. 1911, Bureau of Education. It is  probable that suckers can be obtained from the cultivated plants in  about a year after they are set out.    [18] At this writing no data are at hand as to the preparation  of sarakat straw, but it is probably made simply by drying. It is  possible that much stronger and more pliable straw could be obtained if  a process such as is used in the preparation of sabutan were followed.

[20] It is probable that the improved Andes stripper can be utilized  in the cutting of pandan straws.    [21] Arrangements are now being made through the schools for the  introduction of sabutan plants into the towns of Majayjay and Luisiana.    [22] Most of the information on \"karagumoy\" is taken from the report  submitted to the Director of Education by Mr. Ralph E. Spencer.    [23] The average was obtained by measuring accurately a number of  specimens of the species sent in to the Bureau of Education from  various provinces    [24] Its most common name is bariu, spelled also bario, balio,  balewe, baleau. In Occidental Negros it is also called, balean,  barog in Surigao, batin in Capiz.

As regards methods of breathing, the descriptions and instructions given  in this volume require no addition, and if carefully followed will prove  of inestimable advantage both hygienically and vocally. It is, however,  a fact that, not only in England, but also on the Continent, pupils are  taught to breathe clavicularly, in opposition to Nature's method, which  is diaphragmatic--_i.e._, the combined forms of rib and diaphragm  breathing. The following is a striking example of the evil of clavicular  breathing.    During last summer an American lady, who had been studying singing in  Milan for three years, came to me in great distress. She had expected to  appear in Grand Opera in London, but, alas! her voice broke down, and  serious throat troubles manifested themselves. She had lost all the  upper notes of her voice from C in alt. down to D in the stave, and what  was left of it was thin, reedy, and tremulous, like that of an old woman  instead of a girl of 24. Her master had insisted on clavicular  breathing, the result being that when her lung capacity was tested it  registered only 80 cubic inches instead of 240. In addition to faulty  breathing, she had been allowed to force up the registers of the voice  to such an extent as to bring on serious congestion, with varicose veins  in the vocal ligaments and in the pharynx. After several lessons the  breathing capacity increased to 200 cubic inches, the voice regained  some of the upper notes, and lost the \"cracked,\" tremulous sound. In  time, with great care, the majority of the notes will come back, but  probably C in alt. will never be reached again, and the general  deterioration of voice may never be fully overcome.    Numerous similar instances, in men's voices as well as in women's, could  be adduced, but the foregoing suffices; the results of incorrect  breathing and of forcing being much the same in all cases, differing  principally in degree.    In the \"Treatise on the Art of Singing\" by the late Signor Lamperti,  occurs the following passage, which fully bears out the necessity for  diligent acquirement of correct methods of breathing:--\"Masters of the  present day, instead of obliging pupils to make a severe study of the  art of respiration, as a rule, omit it altogether, and take them through  the greater part of a modern opera at every lesson, to the certain ruin  of their voices, and often at the expense of their bodily health. How  many young singers come to Milan or to Paris with beautiful voices,  musical talent, and every other natural gift, who, after putting  themselves under the guidance of a master for two years, study modern  operas; how many of these unfortunately find at the time of their  _debut_ that their voices, instead of being fresh and improved by  education, are already worn and tremulous, and that, through the  ignorance of their master, they have no longer any hope of success in  their artistic career, which was finished before it was begun.\" A sad  but an \"ower true\" description, applicable to other centres of  voice-training besides Milan and Paris.    It is scarcely possible to over-estimate the importance of correct  methods of breathing and of breath management to all voice users,  whether they are singers or speakers. As breath is the motive power of  all voice it needs but little consideration to arrive at the conclusion  that the best method of supply and control of this motor power is of  vital necessity to those who depend upon their voices for success in  their vocation, whether it be that of singer, clergyman, lecturer, or  actor.    Some of the worst descriptions of stammering owe their origin to  improper breath management, and numbers of such cases which have been  under my care have been perfectly cured by specially designed breathing  exercises, adapted to the requirements of each individual case, combined  with training of the various muscles employed in articulation. As no  two persons stammer alike there can be no universal panacea for the cure  of this terrible affliction; it is, therefore, necessary to study the  peculiar idiosyncrasies of each case before formulating a plan of  treatment; and this makes it impossible to write rules for self-cure  suited to every case.      LOUD SINGING.    The practice of always singing loudly is greatly to be deprecated,  leading as it does to undue strain, to coarseness of the voice, and to  utter inability to modulate it into softness and purity of tone. Anyone  can shout and bawl, but not every one can sing softly--therefore always  practise softly until the voice be well formed, when it will be easy to  increase the volume of sound. Constant shouting causes the muscles of  the larynx to lose their contractile power, and a condition is brought  about which is analogous to writer's cramp. Sometimes no voice can be  produced, while at others it is given forth in a series of  uncontrollable jerks. Singers deficient in resonance, and who have not  acquired the best use and control of the various parts of the resonator,  resort to the objectionable practice of forcing their voices, relying  upon power of blast and vigour of shout instead of cultivating  resonance. A loud, big voice, produced with effort, is a manifestation  of a certain amount of physical power; but such voice-production is not  singing, it is mere shouting. Tones so produced will ultimately show  their bad origin by the effect left behind on the misused muscles.      CULTIVATION OF THE RESONATORS.    The resonators of the human voice, about which years ago Emil Behnke  lectured and wrote, are only just beginning to receive the attention  which their important functions deserve. Over some of the resonating  cavities we can obtain no voluntary control; but over the whole of the  mouth, of the buccal cavity, and over part of the pharyngeal we may, by  education, gain as much influence as over the fingers of the hand, and  the results obtained by such training are frequently astonishing. A  student at one of our colleges came to me recently whose first question  was \"Can you teach me how not to sing with a 'squeezed' throat?\"  \"Nothing easier,\" was my reply. On his singing a few notes to me, the  tone of the voice revealed that owing to want of knowledge of the action  of the resonators, he was closing his throat in such a manner that the  voice sounded as if he were singing through the teeth of a comb. Without  looking in his mouth, I drew on a piece of paper the position in which  were his soft palate, the pillars of the fauces, the uvula, and the  tongue, telling him that was the picture he would see on looking at his  throat while singing. This proved on examination to be the case; and  great was his wonderment to find that, after a little practice he could  voluntarily remedy this squeezed position until it gradually disappeared  altogether, and with it the unpleasant quality of voice which had caused  him so much trouble.    The inherent quality of tone is reinforced by the co-vibrations of the  air in the resonance cavities, the greater fulness of the sound being  caused by the increased quantity of air which is set into vibration. The  slightest alteration in the shape of these cavities affects the quality  of vocal tone by altering the direction and size of the air columns.    There is for every tone an air column of a certain size which most  powerfully reinforces that tone; and every resonance cavity answers to  some particular note better than to others. Timbre in the voice depends  largely upon the echoing and re-echoing of these resonance chambers; and  it needs but little reflection to see that the shape given to the mouth  in pronouncing speech sounds--more especially vowel sounds, with all  their various shades--interferes more or less with the purity and  quality of tone. Hence the necessity in singing for modifying vowel  pronunciation to suit the various tones and pitches of the voice. Every  shade of vowel has a certain pitch of its own which is best produced by  certain positions of the mouth, tongue, and soft palate. It is,  therefore, necessary, carefully to shape the mouth so that, on notes of  different pitches, the configuration of the mould may be that which  gives the best quality of the particular vowel tone. There must be an  unimpeded passage for the voice from the larnyx to the lips, and this  cannot be obtained if the same vowel shades are maintained in song as in  speech. The vowels which require the greatest alteration in position of  the mouth are A, E, and U; E being quite the most difficult, because,  contrary to the opinion of some teachers who consider it the best for  forward production of tone, it keeps the sound farther back in the  throat than any other vowel, shutting it up and making the sound thin  and poor. Diligent practice before a mirror is necessary in order to  acquire the best position of the buccal resonance chamber; its  attainment will well repay the trouble taken, for not only will the  voice gain in timbre, in resonance, and in ease, but pronunciation will  become pure and clear.    The vowel \"ah\" is frequently chosen as the best one for vocalising,  because in its pronunciation it is easy to put the mouth in a good  position; and voices are trained on it exclusively, with the result that  no other vowel, or vowel shade, is perfectly produced. Actual false  intonation often arises from want of practice in adjusting the cavity of  the mouth to that shape required for producing the best tone and  resonance on the different notes; the absence of co-ordination between  the fundamental tone and the overtones preventing perfect tune.    The absolute truth of the foregoing remarks may easily be proved by  singing the vowels at either extreme of the \"vowel scale of nature,\"  viz., \"oo and ee,\" over the whole compass of the voice, having regard"]]]
