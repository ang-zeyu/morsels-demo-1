The new line started from the  Mississippi at the mouth of the Yazoo River, and ran due east to the  Chattahoochee at a point near where the town of West Point now stands.  As the upper boundary of British West Florida this line came to be known  as the Yazoo line, and the country above and below it to an indefinite  extent came to be known as the Yazoo country. No boundary can now be  fixed to the region then known as the Yazoo country. At the close of  the Revolutionary War, Great Britain made a treaty which has been  interpreted as vesting in the United States and in Georgia the right  and title to these lands, reaching from the Chattahoochee to the Yazoo  River, and extending on each side of this line to a distance that has  never been estimated.    The Yazoo Fraud itself had a somewhat vague beginning. From the best  information that can now be obtained, it may be said that it was set on  foot in 1789, shortly after the close of the Revolution, by a sharper  who was famous in that day. He was known as Thomas Washington, but his  real name was Walsh. Washington, or Walsh, is described as being a very  extraordinary man. He had fought in the service of Georgia, but he  had the instinct of a speculator; and when the war was ended, he gave  himself up to the devices of those who earn their living by their  wits. He was a man of good address, and his air of candor succeeded in  deceiving all whom he met. Those who dealt with him always had the worst  of the bargain.    When Washington, or Walsh, began to operate in Georgia through agents,  he found the way already prepared for him. The War for Independence  had barely closed, when certain individuals, most of them men of some  influence, began to look on our Western possessions with a greedy  eye. They had an idea of securing these lands and setting up a new  government,--a sort of Western empire. To further their designs they  began by forming themselves into an association called the \"Combined  Society,\" the members of which were bound to secrecy by oaths and other  solemn pledges. The purpose of the Combined Society became known, and  the force of public opinion compelled the members to disband. Some of  them were men of aristocratic pretensions.    Thus Washington, or Walsh, found a great many sympathetic people in  Georgia. He was too well known in the State to undertake any scheme to  which his name was attached: so he worked through an agent, a man named  Sullivan. This man Sullivan had been a captain in the patriot army; but  he had headed the Philadelphia mob which insulted Congress, and he was  compelled to flee to the Mississippi to save his neck. When the old  Congress went out, Sullivan felt free to return. He came to Georgia,  representing, or pretending to represent, the Virginia Yazoo Company, of  which the celebrated Patrick Henry was a member, and made application to  the State Legislature for the purchase of the Western lands. Sullivan's  description of the Yazoo lands was so glowing that another company  was formed in Georgia. Some of the members of the new company formerly  belonged to the Combined Society, but others were men of good standing.  This company employed active agents; but no corrupt means were used so  far as is now known, though some members of the General Assembly were  interested. The efforts of the company were successful. Their act was  passed, and the sale made. Immediately the people began to oppose the  scheme, and to demand the repeal of the act The demand grew into a State  issue, and the new Legislature declared the sale null and void.    [Illustration: The Yazoo Scheme 134]    For a while the land grabbers were quiet; but in 1794 it seemed to the  most eager of the speculators that the time had come for them to make  another effort to secure the rich Western lands that belonged to the  State. They were evidently afraid, that, unless they made haste to get  hold of the lands, the people's Legislature would divide them out or  sell them to the Federal Government. So they formed another conspiracy,  and this time they laid their plans very deep. Acting on the principle  that every man has his price, they managed, by bribery and other  underhanded schemes, to win the sympathy and support of some of the  most prominent men in the State,--men whose names seemed to be far  above suspicion. Some of the highest judges lent their aid to the land  grabbers. Members of Congress were concerned in the scheme. Generals  and other high officers of the militia took part in it. Nothing was left  undone that was calculated to win the support of men who, up to that  time, had enjoyed and deserved the confidence and respect of the  State. The extent of the bribery and corruption that existed would be  altogether beyond belief if the records were not left to show it. The  swindlers were both bold and cunning, and in one way or another sought  to win the support of all the leading men in the State. And they came  very close to succeeding.    The Legislature held its session in Augusta at that time; and while the  Yazoo land sale was up for discussion, the agents of the land grabbers  swarmed around it, coaxing, bribing, and bullying the people's  representatives. Among these agents was a judge of the Supreme Court of  the United States, from Pennsylvania, with twenty-five thousand dollars  in his hands. There was a judge of the United States District Court for  Georgia, paying shares in the land company for the votes of members. A  United States senator from Georgia, James Gunn, who had neglected to  return to his post of duty in Congress, was seen bullying members with a  loaded whip, to secure their support for the land-sale scheme. A judge  of the State courts was also present, with other prominent citizens,  buttonholing the members of the Legislature, offering them shares,  sub-shares, and half sub-shares to secure their votes. General James  Jackson, who was then a United States senator from Georgia, was told by  a prominent judge of the State that he might have any number of acres he  pleased up to half a million, without the payment of a dollar, if he  would use his influence in behalf of the corrupt schemes of the land  grabbers. In reply, General Jackson said he had fought for the people of  Georgia; that the land belonged to them and to their children; and that,  should the conspirators succeed, he, for one, would hold the sale to be  void. Many weak men in the Legislature were intimidated by threats; and  some who could not be persuaded to vote for the sale, were paid to go  home, and remain away from the Legislature.    In this way the representatives of the people were persuaded and bribed  to support the scheme of the land grabbers. In 1795 the bill was passed,  selling to four companies--the Georgia Company, the Georgia  Mississippi Company, the Upper Mississippi Company, and the Tennessee  Company--thirty-five million acres of land for $500,000. Nothing was now  wanting to complete the fraud but the signature of the governor. If he  put his name to the bill, it became a law. If he refused to sign it,  the scheme of the swindlers would fail. General George Matthews was the  governor at that time, and, though two of his sons had been made members  of the land-grabbing companies, it was hoped that he would refuse to  sign the bill. The hope was justified by the fact that he had refused to  sign a similar bill, and had given some very good reasons for it. It  was known, too, that he was a man of great courage, and honest in his  intentions; but the influence brought to bear on him was too great. His  judgment was weakened by the clamor of the prominent men around him, who  had become the paid agents of the swindlers. He resisted for some time,  but finally agreed to sign the bill. The secretary of Governor Matthews,  a man named Urquhart, tried to prevent the signing of the bill by  working on the governor's superstitions. He dipped the pen in oil,  thinking that when Matthews came to write with it, and found that the  ink refused to flow, he would take it as an omen that the bill should  not be signed. The governor was startled, when, after several efforts,  he found the pen would not write; but he was not a man to let so  trifling a matter stand in his way. He directed his secretary to make  another pen, and with this he made the land-steal bill a law. By a  stroke he made the bill a law, and also signed away his own popularity  and influence. The people of Georgia never trusted him afterwards; and  he left the State, finding it unpleasant and uncomfortable to live among  those who had lost their respect for him. Yet no charge of corruption  was ever made against him.    When the people learned that the Yazoo Fraud had become a law, they rose  up as one man to denounce it. Those who lived in the neighborhood of  Augusta determined to put to death the men who had betrayed them. They  marched to the legislative halls, and were only prevented from carrying  out their threats by the persuasion of the small minority of the members  that had refused to be coaxed, bullied, or bribed into voting for the  Yazoo Fraud. But the indignation of the people continued to grow as  they learned of the corrupt methods that had been employed to pass the  measure. Meetings were held in every county; and public opinion  became so strong that those who had voted for the Yazoo Fraud found it  dangerous to remain in the State. A senator from Hancock County became  so alarmed that he fled to South Carolina. He was followed by one of his  neighbors, found in a lonely cabin at night, and shot to death. Except  in one or two counties, the men who voted for the Yazoo Fraud were  compelled to hide themselves until the anger of the people had cooled.

Gilmer tells a little story that will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24737"],[0,"The Children of Odin: The Book of Northern Myths (#18)"],[1,"ourself. Mind that you take a  bait large enough. It is not where the little fishes are, the place  where I'm going to take you. If you never saw monsters before you'll see  them now. I'm glad, Asa Thor, that you spoke of going fishing.\"    \"Will this bait be big enough?\" said Thor, laying his hands on the horns  of the bull that Hrymer had captured and brought home, the bull with the  mighty head of horns that was called \"Heaven-breaking.\" \"Will this bait  be big enough, do you think?\"    \"Yes, if you're big enough to handle it,\" said the Giant.    Thor said nothing, but he struck the bull full in the middle of the  forehead with his fist. The great creature fell down dead. Thor then  twisted the bull's head off. \"I have my bait and I'm ready to go with  you, Hrymer,\" he said.    Hrymer had turned away to hide the rage he was in at seeing Thor do such  a feat. He walked down to the boat without speaking. \"You may row for  the first few strokes,\" said Hrymer, when they were in the boat, \"but  when we come to where the ocean is rough, why I'll take the oars from  you.\"    Without saying a word Thor made a few strokes that took the boat out  into the middle of the ocean. Hrymer was in a rage to think that he  could not show himself greater than Thor. He let out his line and began  to fish. Soon he felt something huge on his hook. The boat rocked and  rocked till Thor steadied it. Then Hrymer drew into the boat the largest  whale that was in these seas.    \"Good fishing,\" said Thor, as he put his own bait on the line.    \"It's something for you to tell the AEsir,\" said Hrymer.    \"I thought as you were here I'd show you something bigger than  salmon-fishing.\"    \"I'll try my luck now,\" said Thor.    He threw out a line that had at the end of it the mighty-horned head of  the great bull. Down, down the head went. It passed where the whales  swim, and the whales were afraid to gulp at the mighty horns. Down, down  it went till it came near where the monster serpent that coils itself  round the world abides. It reared its head up from its serpent coils as  Thor's bait came down through the depths of the ocean. It gulped at the  head and drew it into its gullet. There the great hook stuck. Terribly  surprised was the serpent monster. It lashed the ocean into a fury. But  still the hook stayed. Then it strove to draw down to the depths of the  ocean the boat of those who had hooked it. Thor put his legs across the  boat and stretched them till they touched the bottom bed of the ocean.  On the bottom bed of the ocean Thor stood and he pulled and he pulled on  his line. The serpent monster lashed the ocean into fiercer and fiercer  storms and all the world's ships were hurled against each other and  wrecked and tossed. But it had to loosen coil after coil of the coils it  makes around the world. Thor pulled and pulled. Then the terrible head  of the serpent monster appeared above the waters. It reared over the  boat that Hrymer sat in and that Thor straddled across. Thor dropped the  line and took up Mioelnir, his mighty hammer. He raised it to strike the  head of the serpent monster whose coils go round the world. But Hrymer  would not have that happen. Rather than have Thor pass him by such a  feat he cut the line, and the head of the serpent monster sank back into  the sea. Thor's hammer was raised. He hurled it, hurled that hammer that  always came back to his hand. It followed the sinking head through  fathom after fathom of the ocean depth. It struck the serpent monster a  blow, but not such a deadly blow as would have been struck if the water  had not come between. A bellow of pain came up from the depths of the  ocean, such a bellow of pain that all in Joetunheim were affrighted.    \"This surely is something to tell the AEsir of,\" said Thor, \"something to  make them forget Loki's mockeries.\"    Without speaking Hrymer turned the boat and rowed toward the shore,  dragging the whale in the wake. He was in such a rage to think that one  of the AEsir had done a feat surpassing his that he would not speak. At  supper, too, he remained silent, but Thor talked for two, boasting  loudly of his triumph over the monster serpent.    \"No doubt you think yourself very powerful, Asa Thor,\" Hrymer said at  last. \"Well, do you think you are powerful enough to break the cup that  is before you?\"    Thor took up the cup and with a laugh he hurled it against the stone  pillar of the house. The cup fell down on the floor without a crack or a  dint in it. But the pillar was shattered with the blow.    The Giant laughed. \"So feeble are the folk of Asgard!\" he said.    Thor took up the cup again and flung it with greater force against the  stone pillar. And again the cup fell to the ground without a crack or a  dint.    Then he heard the woman who was the mother of the Giant youth sing  softly, as she plied her wheel behind him:         Not at the pillar of the stead,       But at Hrymer's massy head:       When you next the goblet throw,       Let his head receive the blow.    Thor took the cup up again. He flung it, not at the pillar this time,  but at Hrymer's head. It struck the Giant full on the forehead and fell  down on the floor in pieces. And Hrymer's head was left without a dint  or a crack.    \"Ha, so you can break a cup, but can you lift up my mile-wide kettle?\"  cried the Giant.    \"Show me where your mile-wide kettle is and I shall try to lift it,\"  cried Thor.    The Giant took up the flooring and showed him the mile-wide kettle down  in the cellar. Thor stooped down and took the kettle by the brim. He  lifted it slowly as if with a mighty effort.    \"You can lift, but can you carry it?\" said the Giant.    \"I will try to do that,\" said Thor. He lifted the kettle up and placed  it on his head. He strode to the door and out of the house before the  Giant could lay hands on him. Then when he was outside he started to  run. He was across the mountain before he looked behind him. He heard a  yelping and a screaming and he saw the Giant crone with the bunch of  heads running, running after him. Up hill and down dale Thor raced, the  mile-wide kettle on his head and the Giant crone in chase of him.  Through the deep forest he ran and over the high mountain, but still  Bunch-of-Heads kept him in chase. But at last, jumping over a lake, she  fell in and Thor was free of his pursuer.    And so back to the AEsir and the Vanir Thor came in triumph, carrying on  his head the mile-wide kettle. And those of the AEsir and the Vanir who  had laughed most at Loki's mockeries rose up and cheered for him as he  came in. The mead was brewed, the feast was spread, and the greatest  banquet that ever the Kings of the Giants gave to the Dwellers in Asgard  was eaten in gladness.    A strange and silent figure sat at the banquet. It was the figure of a  Giant and no one knew who he was nor where he had come from. But when  the banquet was ended Odin, the Eldest of the Gods, turned toward this  figure and said, \"O Skyrmir, Giant King of Utgard, rise up now and tell  Thor of all you practiced upon him when he and Loki came to your City.\"    Then the stranger at the banquet stood up, and Thor and Loki saw he was  the Giant King in whose halls they had had the contests. Skyrmir turned  toward them and said:    \"O Thor and O Loki, I will reveal to you now the deceits I practiced on  you both. It was I whom ye met on the moorland on the day before ye came  into Utgard. I gave you my name as Skyrmir and I did all I might do to  prevent your entering our City, for the Giants dreaded a contest of  strength with Asa Thor. Now hear me, O Thor. The wallet I gave for you  to take provisions out of was tied with magic knots. No one could undo  them by strength or cleverness. And while you were striving to undo them  I placed a mountain of rock between myself and you. The hammer blows,  which as you thought struck me, struck the mountain and made great  clefts and gaps in it. When I knew the strength of your tremendous blows  I was more and more in dread of your coming into our City.    \"I saw you would have to be deceived by magic. Your lad Thialfi was the  one whom I first deceived. For it was not a Giant youth who raced  against him, but Thought itself. And even you, O Loki, I deceived. For  when you tried to make yourself out the greatest of eaters I pitted  against you, not a Giant, but Fire that devours everything.    \"You, Thor, were deceived in all the contests. After you had taken the  drinking horn in your hands we were all affrighted to see how much you  were able to gulp down. For the end of that horn was in the sea, and  AEgir, who is here, can tell you that after you had drunk from it, the  level of the sea went down.    \"The cat whom you strove to lift was Nidhoegg, the dragon that gnaws at  the roots of Ygdrassil, the Tree of Trees. Truly we were terrified when  we saw that you made Nidhoegg budge. When you made the back of the cat  reach the roof of our palace we said to ourselves, 'Thor is the  mightiest of all the beings we have known.'    \"Lastly you strove with the hag Ellie. Her strength seemed marvelous to  you, and you thought yourself disgraced because you could not throw her.  But know, Thor, that Ellie whom you wrestled with was Old Age herself.  We were terrified again to see that she who can overthrow all was not  able to force you prone upon the ground.\"    So Skyrmir spoke and then left the hall. And once more the AEsir and the  Vanir stood up and cheered for Thor, the strongest of all who guarded  Asgard.          [Illustration]    THE DWARF'S HOARD, AND THE CURSE THAT IT BROUGHT      Now old AEgir's feast was over and all the AEsir and the Vanir made ready  for their return to Asgard. Two only went on another way--Odin, the  Eldest of the Gods, and Loki the Mischievous.    Loki and Odin laid aside all that they had kept of the divine power and  the divine strength. They were going into the World of Men, and they  would be as "]]]
