Very soon a cloud of flies that looked like bees hung over him, and  Ugh-lomi could hear their humming. And when Ugh-lomi's flesh was already  healing--and it was not many days before that began--only a few bones of  the lion remained scattered and shining white.    For the most part Ugh-lomi sat still during the day, looking before him  at nothing, sometimes he would mutter of the horses and bears and lions,  and sometimes he would beat the ground with the first axe and say the  names of the tribe--he seemed to have no fear of bringing the tribe--for  hours together. But chiefly he slept, dreaming little because of his  loss of blood and the slightness of his food. During the short summer  night both kept awake. All the while the darkness lasted things moved  about them, things they never saw by day. For some nights the hyaenas did  not come, and then one moonless night near a dozen came and fought for  what was left of the lion. The night was a tumult of growling, and  Ugh-lomi and Eudena could hear the bones snap in their teeth. But they  knew the hyaena dare not attack any creature alive and awake, and so they  were not greatly afraid.    Of a daytime Eudena would go along the narrow path the old lion had made  in the reeds until she was beyond the bend, and then she would creep  into the thicket and watch the tribe. She would lie close by the alders  where they had bound her to offer her up to the lion, and thence she  could see them on the knoll by the fire, small and clear, as she had  seen them that night. But she told Ugh-lomi little of what she saw,  because she feared to bring them by their names. For so they believed in  those days, that naming called.    She saw the men prepare stabbing-spears and throwing-stones on the  morning after Ugh-lomi had slain the lion, and go out to hunt him,  leaving the women and children on the knoll. Little they knew how near  he was as they tracked off in single file towards the hills, with Siss  the Tracker leading them. And she watched the women and children, after  the men had gone, gathering fern-fronds and twigs for the night fire,  and the boys and girls running and playing together. But the very old  woman made her feel afraid. Towards noon, when most of the others were  down at the stream by the bend, she came and stood on the hither side of  the knoll, a gnarled brown figure, and gesticulated so that Eudena could  scarce believe she was not seen. Eudena lay like a hare in its form,  with shining eyes fixed on the bent witch away there, and presently she  dimly understood it was the lion the old woman was worshipping--the lion  Ugh-lomi had slain.    And the next day the hunters came back weary, carrying a fawn, and  Eudena watched the feast enviously. And then came a strange thing. She  saw--distinctly she heard--the old woman shrieking and gesticulating  and pointing towards her. She was afraid, and crept like a snake out of  sight again. But presently curiosity overcame her and she was back at  her spying-place, and as she peered her heart stopped, for there were  all the men, with their weapons in their hands, walking together towards  her from the knoll.    She dared not move lest her movement should be seen, but she pressed  herself close to the ground. The sun was low and the golden light was in  the faces of the men. She saw they carried a piece of rich red meat  thrust through by an ashen stake. Presently they stopped. \"Go on!\"  screamed the old woman. Cat's-skin grumbled, and they came on, searching  the thicket with sun-dazzled eyes. \"Here!\" said Siss. And they took the  ashen stake with the meat upon it and thrust it into the ground. \"Uya!\"  cried Siss, \"behold thy portion. And Ugh-lomi we have slain. Of a truth  we have slain Ugh-lomi. This day we slew Ugh-lomi, and to-morrow we will  bring his body to you.\" And the others repeated the words.    They looked at each other and behind them, and partly turned and began  going back. At first they walked half turned to the thicket, then facing  the mound they walked faster looking over their shoulders, then faster;  soon they ran, it was a race at last, until they were near the knoll.  Then Siss who was hindmost was first to slacken his pace.    The sunset passed and the twilight came, the fires glowed red against  the hazy blue of the distant chestnut-trees, and the voices over the  mound were merry. Eudena lay scarcely stirring, looking from the mound  to the meat and then to the mound. She was hungry, but she was afraid.  At last she crept back to Ugh-lomi.    He looked round at the little rustle of her approach. His face was in  shadow. \"Have you got me some food?\" he said.    She said she could find nothing, but that she would seek further, and  went back along the lion's path until she could see the mound again, but  she could not bring herself to take the meat; she had the brute's  instinct of a snare. She felt very miserable.    She crept back at last towards Ugh-lomi and heard him stirring and  moaning. She turned back to the mound again; then she saw something in  the darkness near the stake, and peering distinguished a jackal. In a  flash she was brave and angry; she sprang up, cried out, and ran towards  the offering. She stumbled and fell, and heard the growling of the  jackal going off.    When she arose only the ashen stake lay on the ground, the meat was  gone. So she went back, to fast through the night with Ugh-lomi; and  Ugh-lomi was angry with her, because she had no food for him; but she  told him nothing of the things she had seen.    Two days passed and they were near starving, when the tribe slew a  horse. Then came the same ceremony, and a haunch was left on the ashen  stake; but this time Eudena did not hesitate.    By acting and words she made Ugh-lomi understand, but he ate most of the  food before he understood; and then as her meaning passed to him he grew  merry with his food. \"I am Uya,\" he said; \"I am the Lion. I am the Great  Cave Bear, I who was only Ugh-lomi. I am Wau the Cunning. It is well  that they should feed me, for presently I will kill them all.\"    Then Eudena's heart was light, and she laughed with him; and afterwards  she ate what he had left of the horseflesh with gladness.    After that it was he had a dream, and the next day he made Eudena bring  him the lion's teeth and claws--so much of them as she could find--and  hack him a club of alder. And he put the teeth and claws very cunningly  into the wood so that the points were outward. Very long it took him,  and he blunted two of the teeth hammering them in, and was very angry  and threw the thing away; but afterwards he dragged himself to where he  had thrown it and finished it--a club of a new sort set with teeth. That  day there was more meat for them both, an offering to the lion from the  tribe.    It was one day--more than a hand's fingers of days, more than anyone had  skill to count--after Ugh-lomi had made the club, that Eudena while he  was asleep was lying in the thicket watching the squatting-place. There  had been no meat for three days. And the old woman came and worshipped  after her manner. Now while she worshipped, Eudena's little friend Si  and another, the child of the first girl Siss had loved, came over the  knoll and stood regarding her skinny figure, and presently they began to  mock her. Eudena found this entertaining, but suddenly the old woman  turned on them quickly and saw them. For a moment she stood and they  stood motionless, and then with a shriek of rage, she rushed towards  them, and all three disappeared over the crest of the knoll.    Presently the children reappeared among the ferns beyond the shoulder of  the hill. Little Si ran first, for she was an active girl, and the  other child ran squealing with the old woman close upon her. And over  the knoll came Siss with a bone in his hand, and Bo and Cat's-skin  obsequiously behind him, each holding a piece of food, and they laughed  aloud and shouted to see the old woman so angry. And with a shriek the  child was caught and the old woman set to work slapping and the child  screaming, and it was very good after-dinner fun for them. Little Si ran  on a little way and stopped at last between fear and curiosity.    And suddenly came the mother of the child, with hair streaming, panting,  and with a stone in her hand, and the old woman turned about like a wild  cat. She was the equal of any woman, was the chief of the fire-minders,  in spite of her years; but before she could do anything Siss shouted to  her and the clamour rose loud. Other shock heads came into sight. It  seemed the whole tribe was at home and feasting. But the old woman dared  not go on wreaking herself on the child Siss befriended.    Everyone made noises and called names--even little Si. Abruptly the old  woman let go of the child she had caught and made a swift run at Si for  Si had no friends; and Si, realising her danger when it was almost upon  her, made off headlong, with a faint cry of terror, not heeding whither  she ran, straight to the lair of the lion. She swerved aside into the  reeds presently, realising now whither she went.    But the old woman was a wonderful old woman, as active as she was  spiteful, and she caught Si by the streaming hair within thirty yards of  Eudena. All the tribe now was running down the knoll and shouting and  laughing ready to see the fun.    Then something stirred in Eudena; something that had never stirred in  her before; and, thinking all of little Si and nothing of her fear, she  sprang up from her ambush and ran swiftly forward. The old woman did not  see her, for she was busy beating little Si's face with her hand,  beating with all her heart, and suddenly something hard and heavy struck  her cheek. She went reeling, and saw Eudena with flaming eyes and cheeks  between her and little Si. She shrieked with astonishment and terror,  and little Si, not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27378"],[0,"The Story of the Heavens (#18)"],[1,"almanac, and then the height of the object follows by a simple  calculation. Indeed, if the observations can be made either on the 6th  of April or the 6th of September, at or near the latitude of London,  then calculations would be unnecessary. The noonday length of the shadow  on either of the dates named is equal to the altitude of the object. In  summer the length of the noontide shadow is less than the altitude; in  winter the length of the shadow exceeds the altitude. At sunrise or  sunset the shadows are, of course, much longer than at noon, and it is  shadows of this kind that we observe on the moon. The necessary  measurements are made by that indispensable adjunct to the equatorial  telescope known as the _micrometer_.    This word denotes an instrument for measuring _small_ distances. In one  sense the term is not a happy one. The objects to which the astronomer  applies the micrometer are usually anything but small. They are  generally of the most transcendent dimensions, far exceeding the moon or  the sun, or even our whole system. Still, the name is not altogether  inappropriate, for, vast though the objects may be, they generally seem  minute, even in the telescope, on account of their great distance.    We require for such measurements an instrument capable of the greatest  nicety. Here, again, we invoke the aid of the spider, to whose  assistance in another department we have already referred. In the filar  micrometer two spider lines are parallel, and one intersects them at  right angles. One or both of the parallel lines can be moved by means of  screws, the threads of which have been shaped by consummate workmanship.  The distance through which the line has been moved is accurately  indicated by noting the number of revolutions and parts of a revolution  of the screw. Suppose the two lines be first brought into coincidence,  and then separated until the apparent length of the shadow of the  mountain on the moon is equal to the distance between the lines: we then  know the number of revolutions of the micrometer screw which is  equivalent to the length of the shadow. The number of miles on the moon  which correspond to one revolution of the screw has been previously  ascertained by other observations, and hence the length of the shadow  can be determined. The elevation of the sun, as it would have appeared  to an observer at this point of the moon, at the moment when the  measures were being made, is also obtainable, and hence the actual  elevation of the mountain can be calculated. By measurements of this  kind the altitudes of other lunar objects, such, for example, as the  height of the rampart surrounding a circular-walled plane, can be  determined.    The beauty and interest of the moon as a telescopic object induces us to  give to the student a somewhat detailed account of the more remarkable  features which it presents. Most of the objects we are to describe can  be effectively exhibited with very moderate telescopic power. It is,  however, to be remembered that all of them cannot be well seen at one  time. The region most distinctly shown is the boundary between light and  darkness. The student will, therefore, select for observation such  objects as may happen to lie near that boundary at the time when he is  observing.    1. _Posidonius._--The diameter of this large crater is nearly 60 miles.  Although its surrounding wall is comparatively slender, it is so  distinctly marked as to make the object very conspicuous. As so  frequently happens in lunar volcanoes, the bottom of the crater is below  the level of the surrounding plain, in the present instance to the  extent of nearly 2,500 feet.    2. _Linne._--This small crater lies in the Mare Serenitatis. About sixty  years ago it was described as being about 6-1/2 miles in diameter, and  seems to have been sufficiently conspicuous. In 1866 Schmidt, of Athens,  announced that the crater had disappeared. Since then an exceedingly  small shallow depression has been visible, but the whole object is now  very inconsiderable. This seems to be the most clearly attested case of  change in a lunar object. Apparently the walls of the crater have  tumbled into the interior and partly filled it up, but many astronomers  doubt that a change has really taken place, as Schroeter, a Hanoverian  observer at the end of the eighteenth century, appears not to have seen  any conspicuous crater in the place, though it must be admitted that  his observations are rather incomplete. To give some idea of Schmidt's  amazing industry in lunar researches, it may be mentioned that in six  years he made nearly 57,000 individual settings of his micrometer in the  measurement of lunar altitudes. His great chart of the mountains in the  moon is based on no less than 2,731 drawings and sketches, if those are  counted twice that may have been used for two divisions of the map.    3. _Aristotle._--This great philosopher's name has been attached to a  grand crater 50 miles in diameter, the interior of which, although very  hilly, shows no decidedly marked central cone. But the lofty wall of the  crater, exceeding 10,500 feet in height, overshadows the floor so  continuously that its features are never seen to advantage.    4. _The Great Valley of the Alps._--A wonderfully straight valley, with  a width ranging from 3-1/2 to 6 miles, runs right through the lunar  Alps. It is, according to Maedler, at least 11,500 feet deep, and over 80  miles in length. A few low ridges which are parallel to the sides of the  valley may possibly be the result of landslips.    5. _Aristillus._--Under favourable conditions Lord Rosse's great  telescope has shown the exterior of this magnificent crater to be scored  with deep gullies radiating from its centre. Aristillus is about 34  miles wide and 10,000 feet in depth.    6. _Autolycus_ is somewhat smaller than the foregoing, to which it forms  a companion in accordance with what Maedler thought a well-defined  relation amongst lunar craters, by which they frequently occurred in  pairs, with the smaller one more usually to the south. Towards the edge  this arrangement is generally rather apparent than real, and is merely a  result of foreshortening.    7. _Archimedes._--This large plain, about 50 miles in diameter, has its  vast smooth interior divided by unequally bright streaks into seven  distinct zones, running east and west. There is no central mountain or  other obvious internal sign of former activity, but its irregular wall  rises into abrupt towers, and is marked outside by decided terraces.    [Illustration: PLATE B.    PORTION OF THE MOON.    (ALPS, ARCHIMEDES, APENNINES.)    _Messrs. Loewy & Puiseux_.]    8. _Plato._--We have already referred to this extensive circular plain,  which is noticeable with the smallest telescope. The average height of  the rampart is about 3,800 feet on the eastern side; the western side is  somewhat lower, but there is one peak rising to the height of nearly  7,300 feet. The plain girdled by this vast rampart is of ample  proportions. It is a somewhat irregular circle, about 60 miles in  diameter, and containing an area of 2,700 square miles. On its floor the  shadows of the western wall are shown in Plate IX., as are also three of  the small craters, of which a large number have been detected by  persevering observers. The narrow sharp line leading from the crater to  the left is one of those remarkable \"clefts\" which traverse the moon in  so many directions. Another may be seen further to the left. Above Plato  are several detached mountains, the loftiest of which is Pico, about  8,000 feet in height. Its long and pointed shadow would at first sight  lead one to suppose that it must be very steep; but Schmidt, who  specially studied the inclinations of the lunar slopes, is of opinion  that it cannot be nearly so steep as many of the Swiss mountains that  are frequently ascended. As many as thirty minute craters have been  carefully observed on the floor of Plato, and variations have been  thought by Mr. W.H. Pickering to be perceptible.    9. _Eratosthenes._--This profound crater, upwards of 37 miles in  diameter, lies at the end of the gigantic range of the Apennines. Not  improbably, Eratosthenes once formed the volcanic vent for the  stupendous forces that elevated the comparatively craterless peaks of  these great mountains.    10. _Copernicus._--Of all the lunar craters this is one of the grandest  and best known. The region to the west is dotted over with innumerable  minute craterlets. It has a central many-peaked mountain about 2,400  feet in height. There is good reason to believe that the terracing shown  in its interior is mainly due to the repeated alternate rise, partial  congelation, and subsequent retreat of a vast sea of lava. At full moon  the crater of Copernicus is seen to be surrounded by radiating streaks.    11. _Kepler._--Although the internal depth of this crater is scarcely  less than 10,000 feet, it has but a very low surrounding wall, which is  remarkable for being covered with the same glistening substance that  also forms a system of bright rays not unlike those surrounding the last  object.    12. _Aristarchus_ is the most brilliant of the lunar craters, being  specially vivid with a low power in a large telescope. So bright is it,  indeed, that it has often been seen on the dark side just after new  moon, and has thus given rise to marvellous stories of active lunar  volcanoes. To the south-east lies another smaller crater, Herodotus,  north of which is a narrow, deep valley, nowhere more than 2-1/2 miles  broad, which makes a remarkable zigzag. It is one of the largest of the  lunar \"clefts.\"    13. _Grimaldi_ calls for notice as the darkest object of its size in the  moon. Under very exceptional circumstances it has been seen with the  naked eye, and as its area has been estimated at nearly 14,000 square  miles, it gives an idea of how little unaided vision"]]]
