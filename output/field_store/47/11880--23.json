Benedict      about the observance of Lent be read, and a discourse be      preached upon it. Next let the librarian read a document      (_breve_) setting forth the names of the brethren who      have had books during the past year; and let each      brother, when he hears his own name pronounced, return      the book which had been entrusted to him for reading;      and let him who is conscious of not having read the book      through which he had received, fall down on his face,      confess his fault, and pray for forgiveness.        Then let the aforesaid librarian hand to each brother      another book for reading; and when the books have been      distributed in order, let the aforesaid librarian in the      same Chapter put on record the names of the books, and      of those who receive them[132].    It is, I think, certain that when Lanfranc was writing this passage the  Cluniac Customs must have been before him[133]. It should be noted that  the librarian is not defined otherwise than as \"keeper of the books,\" but  we learn from the Customs of Benedictine houses subsequent to Lanfranc's  time that this duty was discharged by the Precentor, as in the Cluniac  Customs. For instance, in the Customs of the Benedictine house at  Abingdon, in Berkshire, drawn up near the end of the twelfth century, we  read:        The precentor shall keep clean the presses belonging to      the boys and the novices, and all others in which the      books of the convent are stored, repair them when they      are broken, provide coverings for the books in the      library, and make good any damage done to them[134].        The precentor cannot sell, or give away, or pledge any      books; nor can he lend any except on deposit of a      pledge, of equal or greater value than the book itself.      It is safer to fall back on a pledge, than to proceed      against an individual. Moreover he may not lend except      to neighbouring churches, or to persons of conspicuous      worth[135].    The Customs of the Abbey of Evesham in Worcestershire give the same  directions in a slightly different form.        It is part of the precentor's duty to entrust to the      younger monks the care of the presses, and to keep them      in repair: whenever the convent is sitting in cloister,      he is to go round the cloister as soon as the bell has      sounded, and replace the books, in case any brother      through carelessness should have forgotten to do so.        He is to take charge of all the books in the monastery,      and have them in his keeping, provided his carefulness      and knowledge be such that they may be entrusted to him.      No one is to take a book out unless it be entered on his      roll: nor is any book to be lent to any one without a      proper and sufficient voucher, and this too is to be set      down on his roll[136].    The Carthusians--the second offshoot of the Benedictine tree (1084)--also  preserved the primitive tradition of study. They not only read themselves,  but were actively employed in writing books for others. In the chapter of  their statutes which deals with the furniture allowed to each \"tenant of a  cell (_incola celle_)\"--(for in this community each brother lived apart,  with his sitting-room, bed-room, and plot of garden-ground)--all the  articles needful for writing are enumerated, \"for nearly all those whom we  adopt we teach, if possible, to write,\" and then the writer passes on to  books.        Moreover he--[the tenant of the cell]--receives two      books out of the press for reading. He is admonished to      take the utmost care and pains that they be not soiled      by smoke or dust or dirt of any kind; for it is our wish      that books, as being the perpetual food of our souls,      should be most jealously guarded, and most carefully      produced, that we, who cannot preach the word of God      with our lips, may preach it with our hands[137].    They did, however, on occasion lend books, for it is provided that when  books are lent no one shall retain them contrary to the will of the  lenders[138]. It would be interesting to know how this rule was enforced.    The Cistercian Order--founded 1128--adopted the Benedictine Rule, and with  it the obligation of study and writing. Moreover, in their anxiety to take  due care of their books, they went further than their predecessors; for  they entrusted them to a special officer, instead of to the precentor, and  they admitted a special room to contain them into the ground-plan of their  houses.    At a later point I shall return to the interesting subject of the  Cistercian book-room. For the present I must content myself with  translating from their Customs the passage relating to books. It occurs in  Chapter CXV., _Of the precentor and his assistant_. After describing his  various duties, the writer proceeds:        With regard to the production and safe-keeping of      charters and books, the abbat is to consider to whom he      shall entrust this duty.        The officer so appointed may go as far as the doors of      the writing-rooms when he wants to hand in or to take      out a book, but he may not go inside. In the same way      for books in common use, as for instance antiphoners,      hymnals, graduals, lectionaries [etc.], and those which      are read in the Prater and at Collation, he may go as      far as the door of the novices, and of the sick, and of      the writers, and then ask for what he wants by a sign,      but he may not go further unless he have been commanded      by the abbat. When Collation is over it is his duty to      close the press, and during the period of labour, of      sleep, and of meals, and while vespers are being sung,      to keep it locked[139].    The Customs of the Augustinian Order are exceedingly full on the subject  of books. I will translate part of the 14th chapter of the Customs in use  at Barnwell[140], near Cambridge. It is headed: _Of the safe keeping of  the books, and of the office of Librarian (armarius)._ As the passage  occurs also in the Customs as observed in France and in Belgium, it may be  taken, I presume, to represent the general practice of the Order.        The Librarian, who is called also Precentor, is to take      charge of the books of the church; all which he ought to      keep and to know under their separate titles; and he      should frequently examine them carefully to prevent any      damage or injury from insects or decay. He ought also,      at the beginning of Lent, in each year, to shew them to      the convent in Chapter, when the souls of those who have      given them to the church, or of the brethren who have      written them, and laboured over them, ought to be      absolved, and a service in convent be held over them. He      ought also to hand to the brethren the books which they      see occasion to use, and to enter on his roll the titles      of the books, and the names of those who receive them.      These, when required, are bound to give surety for the      volumes they receive; nor may they lend them to others,      whether known or unknown, without having first obtained      permission from the Librarian. Nor ought the Librarian      himself to lend books unless he receive a pledge of      equal value; and then he ought to enter on his roll the      name of the borrower, the title of the book lent, and      the pledge taken. The larger and more valuable books he      ought not to lend to anyone, known or unknown, without      permission of the Prelate....        Books which are to be kept at hand for daily use,      whether for singing or reading, ought to be in some      common place, to which all the brethren can have easy      access for inspection, and selection of anything which      seems to them suitable. The books, therefore, ought not      to be carried away into chambers, or into corners      outside the Cloister or the Church. The Librarian ought      frequently to dust the books carefully, to repair them,      and to point them, lest brethren should find any error      or hindrance in the daily service of the church, whether      in singing or in reading. No other brother ought to      erase or change anything in the books unless he have      obtained the consent of the Librarian....        The press in which the books are kept ought to be lined      inside with wood, that the damp of the walls may not      moisten or stain the books. This press should be divided      vertically as well as horizontally by sundry shelves on      which the books may be ranged so as to be separated from      one another; for fear they be packed so close as to      injure each other or delay those who want them[141].        Further, as the books ought to be mended, pointed, and      taken care of by the Librarian, so ought they to be      properly bound by him.    The Order of Premontre--better known as the Premonstratensians, or  reformed Augustinians--repeat the essential part of these directions in  their statute, _Of the Librarian (armarius)_, with this addition, that it  is to be part of the librarian's duty to provide for the borrowing of  books for the use of the House, as well as for lending[142].    Lastly, the Friars, though property was forbidden, and S. Francis would  not allow his disciples to own so much as a psalter or a breviary[143],  soon found that books were a necessity, and the severity of early  discipline was relaxed in favour of a library. S. Francis died in 1226,  and only thirty-four years afterwards, among the constitutions adopted by  a General Chapter of the Order held at Narbonne 10 June, 1260, are several  provisions relating to books. They are of no great importance, taken by  themselves, but their appearance at so early a date proves that books had  become indispensable. It is enacted that no brother may"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26393"],[0,"The Medicinal Plants of the Philippines (#18)"],[1,"Sibukao  as a substitute for logwood. The decoction is administered in chronic  diarrhoea, especially that of children. A few cases of phlebitis have  been reported as occasioned by its use. The extract is made as follows:              Sibukao in small pieces      500 grams.          Boiling water                  4 1/2 liters.      Macerate for 24 hours, boil until reduced by half, filter and evaporate  the filtrate to a syrupy consistency. Do not use iron vessels.    Sibukao contains much tannin and gallic acid, and a peculiar substance  which distinguishes it from logwood, _brasilin_ (C_22_H_20_O_7_),  which gives a red color to alkaline solutions instead of blue or  purple. It is a crystalline pigment which may be considered a compound  of hematoxylon and fenol.    Botanical Description.--A very common tree, 12-15° high, with spiny  trunk, leaves twice abruptly pinnate. Leaflets linear, notched at  the apex. Flowers racemose. Calyx boat-shaped. Corolla, 5 petals,  the uppermost broad, short, spotted red. Stigma bifid. Pod sabre-like,  woody, with 3-4 seeds separated by partitions. The wood is well known  everywhere in the Philippines, being a very important article of  commerce, and there is no fear of logwood being substituted for it,  as the latter is more expensive, and substitutions are not ordinarily  made under such circumstances. In commerce it occurs in large pieces of  all shapes and forms, since the branches and trunks are cut into pieces  which vary from 1/2-2 meters in length. Its color is reddish-yellow  or white with more or less red grain. Blooms in September.        _Cæsalpinia pulcherrima_, Swartz. (_Poinciana pulcherrima_, L. &  Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Flores y Rosas Caballero_, _Caballero_, Sp.-Fil.;  _Barbadoes Flower-Fence_, Eng.    Uses.--The leaves are emmenagogue, purgative like those of senna,  and excitant. The bark especially is a powerful emmenagogue, used in  some countries for criminal purposes. The decoction of the flowers is  pectoral and febrifuge and is given in bronchitis, asthma and malarial  fever. The flowers contain a bitter principle. The roots are acrid  and poisonous. The seeds of the green fruit are eaten frequently by  children; when ripe they contain gallic and tannic acids, by virtue  of which they are used in tanning hides and to dye yellow combined  with alum, and black combined with salts of iron. They also contain  a pigment and a resin.    Infusion of the Flowers.--              Flowers of the caballero, dry          20 grams.          Water                                 500 grams.          Sugar                                  70 grams.      Mix. Dose, a wineglassful several times a day.    Botanical Description.--A shrub, with prickly trunk. Leaves  twice abruptly pinnate. Leaflets 5-8 pairs, glabrous, ovate and  elliptical, bearing a spine at the extremity, 3 stipules to each  pair of leaflets. Flowers yellow and red, in racemes on the ends  of the branches. Calyx divided almost to the base, with 5 concave  parts. Corolla, 5 petals 1' long with short claws, one petal very small  and straight, the others larger, with wavy edges. Stamens 10, crimson,  3' long, free, woolly, united at the lower end. Pistil the same length  as the stamens. Stigma somewhat concave. Ovary sessile, unilocular,  many-ovuled. Pod compressed, with 7 or more seeds inserted on the  superior suture and separated from each other by fleshy divisions.    Habitat.--Very common in gardens where it is cultivated for its  beautiful flowers. Blooms throughout the entire year.        _Cassia fistula_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Cañafistula_, Sp.; _Lombayong_, _Ibabaw_, _Baloyong_,  Vis.; _Purging Cassia_, Eng.    Uses.--The pod known in pharmacy under the name of \"Cañafistula\"  contains a blackish, sweet pulp, which is a mild purgative if combined  with carminatives, but it produces severe colic if given alone. The  urine sometimes takes on a dark color after taking it. The laxative  dose is 4-8 grams, the purgative 30-60.    Extract of Cassia.--              Pulp and seeds of ripe pods       1 kilo.          Water                             1 liter.      After mixing the pulp with water the liquid is strained through a  woolen cloth; the material which remains in the strainer is washed  with a little more cold water which is added to the other liquid and  the two are evaporated to the consistency of the extract.    Dose.--15-30 grams.    Dr. Irving states that the root is a very energetic purgative. In  Concan the juice of the tender leaves is used in the treatment of  impetigo.    Botanical Description.--A tree with trunk about as thick as the  human body, with leaves opposite and abruptly pinnate. Leaflets,  the lower ones smaller, 5 pairs, ovate, lanceolate, glabrous  and rather tough. Common petiole, cleft at the base, lacking  glandule. Flowers bright yellow, in long, pendulous racemes. Calyx,  5 ovate sepals. Corolla, 5 unequal petals. Stamens 10, free, 3  longer than the rest. Ovary unilocular, many-ovuled. Pod cylindrical,  pointed at the end, woody, black, 1-2° long, with many circular seeds,  surrounded by a blackish pulp and separated by partitions.    Habitat.--Common in Luzon and Panay. Blooms in March.        _Cassia occidentalis_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Tighiman_, _Balotangaso_, Tag.; _Tambalisa_, Vis.;  _Western Senna_, _Styptic Weed_, Eng.; _Negro Coffee_, Indo-Eng.    Uses.--In Brazil they use an infusion of the root as a tonic and  diuretic, 4 grams of the root bark and 180 of boiling water to be taken  in one day. In Dahomey the leaves are used as a febrifuge. Thirty  grams of fresh leaves are boiled in 300 grams of water till the  liquid is reduced to 250 grams. The patient takes this decoction  hot the first day of the fever and a profuse perspiration promptly  breaks out. As a rule the effect is immediate and the fever does not  recur. This treatment of fevers is more common in that country than  that by quinine and they claim that it has the advantage over the  latter of acting as a stomachic tonic. By adding a small quantity  of the roots to the decoction it is rendered diuretic. The seeds  possess the same properties and are used in decoctions of 30 grams  to 300 of water. According to De Lanesan the roasted seeds are used  in La Réunion in infusion similar to coffee in the treatment of  gastralgia and asthma. In some countries they mix them with coffee  just as chicory is used in Europe.    Heckel and Schlagdenhauffen have made a very complete study of the  plant and we quote the following from their works:    Chemical composition of the seeds.--              Water                                           8.850          Fats and pigments soluble in petroleum ether    1.600          Fats and pigments soluble in chloroform         1.150          Odorous material and traces of tannin           5.022          Glucose                                         0.738          Gummy, mucilaginous and pectic matter          15.734          Soluble albuminoids and aleuron                 6.536          Cellulose                                       7.434          Insoluble albuminose                            2.216          Lignose                                        32.727          Fixed salts                                    17.976          Lost material                                    .017                                                        -------                                                        100.000      Previous to the studies of the above authors the seeds had been  therapeutically tested by Delioux de Savignac and Professor  Clouet. Heckel and Schlagdenhauffen have confirmed the febrifuge  virtues of the seeds and are uncertain as to the active principle  since they found no glucoside or alkaloid in their analysis. The  antiperiodic properties are comparable with those of quinine and have  even proved effective in some cases in which quinine failed. It seems  quite clear that the tannin is the active principle which is the  more probable because its anti-periodic virtues are now recognized  by all therapeutists.    It is given in maceration or infusion, 2-15 grams of the seeds to 3  or 400 of water to be taken several times a day. The treatment causes  no very marked physiological effects. It seems to act as a sedative  to the nervous system.    Botanical Description.--An annual plant, .60-1 meter high. Root  central with lateral rootlets. Stem straight, ramose. Leaves opposite,  abruptly pinnate with a stylet in place of the odd leaflet. Leaflets,  5-6 pairs, the lower ones smaller, ovate, oblong, margins and lower  face downy. Common petiole swollen at the base, 2 stipules and 1  glandule. Calyx, 5 unequal sepals. Corolla, 5 nearly equal petals,  sulphur yellow, concave, the posterior one further developed. Two  verticils of 5 stamens each. Of the 5 stamens superior to the sepals,  2 are fertile, larger and arched; of the other 5 stamens 4 are fertile  and small. Pod compressed, linear, smooth, 5' long, containing many  compressed, heart-shaped seeds, separated by thin partitions.    Habitat.--Common in Luzon. Blooms in October.        _Cassia alata_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Acapulco_, Sp.-Fil.; _Katandá_, _Gamut sa Buni_,  _Sonting_, Tag.; _Sunting, Kansitás_, Vis.; _Pakayomkom-kastila_, Pam.    Uses.--This is one of the most popular Philippine remedies and its  usefulness is vouched for by many physicians practicing in many  different lands. Its antiherpetic properties are notable and the  Tagalo name of the plant, \"Gamut sa Buni,\" means literally \"medicine  for herpes.\" The natives use the juice of the leaf applied locally  to the affected part. These properties have long been familiar to  the Malays and to the Hindoos who in their medical works give the  plant the Sanscrit name of \"Dadrughna,\" meaning \"to cure herpes.\" The  Pharmacopoeia of Bengal recommends cassia in the form of an ointment  made by mixing the crushed tender leaves with"]]]
