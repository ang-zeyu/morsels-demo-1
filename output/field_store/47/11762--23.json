But if the director is cold and formal  in his attitude, and if one song after another is sung in the  conventional way with no comment, no anecdote, and no division into  sections, the people will be more than likely to go away criticizing  the leader or the accompanist or the songs or each other, and the next  time the crowd will probably be smaller and the project will  eventually die out. The chronic fault-finder will then say, \"I told  you it was only a fad and that it would not last\"; but he is wrong,  and the failure must be attributed to poor management rather than to  any inherent weakness in the idea itself.    [Sidenote: VARIETY OF SONG MATERIAL MADE POSSIBLE BY COMMUNITY  SINGING]    The majority of people have no opportunity of singing except when they  go to church; but many do not go to church often, and even those who  go do not always sing, and only have the opportunity of singing one  type of music when they do take part. Moreover, for various reasons,  the singing of church congregations is not as hearty as it used to be  a generation or two ago. The opportunity to spend an hour in singing  patriotic hymns, sentimental songs, and occasionally a really fine  composition, such as the _Pilgrims' Chorus_ from _Tannhaeuser_, is  therefore eagerly welcomed by a great many men and women--those  belonging to the upper classes as well as the proletariat. When once  the barrier of formality has been broken down, such gatherings,  especially when directed by a leader who is a good musician as well as  a good mixer, may well become the means of interesting many thousands  of men and women in the more artistic phases of music; may indeed  eventually transform many a community, not only from a crowd of  individuals into a homogeneous social group, but may actually change  the city or village from a spot where ugliness has reigned supreme to  one where the dominating note is beauty--beauty of service as well as  beauty of street and garden and public building; and where drama and  music, pictures and literature, are the most cherished possessions of  the people. In a place which has been so transformed, the \"eight hours  of leisure\" that have so troubled our sociologists will present no  problem whatever; for the community chorus, the neighborhood  orchestra, the music and dramatic clubs, and the splendid libraries  and art galleries will assume most of the burden of providing a worthy  use of leisure.    [Sidenote: THE NECESSITY OF ADVERTISING]    Community \"sings\" (like everything else that is to achieve success in  this age) must be advertised, and to the leader usually falls the lot  of acting as advertising manager. It will be well to begin the  campaign a month or more before the first \"sing\" is to be held,  sending short articles to the local papers, in which is described the  success of similar enterprises in other places. Then a week or so  before the \"sing,\" carefully worded announcements should be read in  churches, Sunday schools, lodge meetings, and high-school assemblies.  In connection with this general publicity, the leader will do well  also to talk personally with a large number of men and women in  various walks of life, asking these people not only to agree to be  present themselves, but urging them to talk about the project to other  friends and acquaintances, inviting them to come also. On the day of  the first \"sing\" it may be well to circulate attractively printed  handbills as a final reminder, these of course giving in unmistakable  language the time and place of the meeting and perhaps stating in bold  type that admission is entirely free and that no funds are to be  solicited. These various advertising activities will naturally  necessitate the expenditure of a small amount of money; but it is  usually possible to secure donations or at least reductions of price  in the case of printing, hall rental, _et cetera_, and the small  amount of actual cash that is needed can usually be raised among a  group of interested people without any difficulty. It is our belief  that the whole project is more likely to succeed if the leader himself  is serving without remuneration, for he will then be easily able to  refute any charge that he is urging the project out of selfish or  mercenary considerations.    [Sidenote: PROVIDING THE WORDS OF SONGS]    The leader of community singing must not make the mistake of supposing  that \"everybody knows _America_, _Swanee River_, and _Old Black Joe_,\"  and that no words need therefore to be provided. As a matter of fact,  not more than one person in twenty-five can repeat correctly even one  of these songs that \"everybody knows,\" and we may as well recognize  this fact at the outset and thus prevent a probable fiasco. There are  three ways of placing the songs before our crowd of people:         1. Having the words of all songs to be sung printed on       sheets of paper and passing one of these out to each person       in the audience.         2. Furnishing a book of songs at a cost of five or ten cents       and asking each person in the audience to purchase this book       before the \"sing\" begins, bringing it back each succeeding       time.         3. Flashing the words (sometimes the music also) on a screen       in front of the assembly. The disadvantage of the last named       method is the fact that the auditorium has to be darkened in       order that the words may stand out clearly; but in       out-of-door singing the plan has very great advantages,       being for this purpose perhaps the best of the three.    After the chorus has gotten well on its feet, it will probably be best  to purchase copies of some larger and more elaborate book, the copies  being either owned by individual members or else purchased out of  treasury funds, and therefore belonging to the organization. At the  first \"sing\" it will be a distinct advantage if no financial outlay  whatever is required of the individuals composing the chorus.    [Sidenote: THE ADVANTAGES OF PLANNING IN ADVANCE]    In conclusion, let us urge the leader of community singing to decide  beforehand just what songs are to be used, and to study the words of  these songs carefully so as to be able to imbue the chorus with the  correct spirit of each one, having at his tongue's end the story of  the song and other pointed remarks about it that will enliven the  occasion and keep things from stagnating. He will, of course,  frequently find it necessary to modify his plan as the \"sing\"  progresses, for one of the most necessary qualifications in the leader  is flexibility and quick wit. But if he has a definite program in mind  and knows his material so well that he does not need to look at his  book, he will be much more likely to succeed in holding the interest  of his chorus throughout the \"sing.\"    Let him be sure that a skilful accompanist is at hand to play the  piano, perhaps even going to the trouble of meeting the accompanist  beforehand and going through all material to be used so as to insure a  mutual understanding upon such matters as tempo, _et cetera_. In  out-of-door group singing a brass quartet (consisting of two cornets  and two trombones, or two cornets, a trombone, and a baritone) is more  effective than a piano, but if this is to be done be sure to find  players who can transpose, or else write out the parts in the proper  transposed keys. When such an accompaniment is to be used, the leader  should have at least one rehearsal with the quartet in order that  there may be no hitches.    [Sidenote: THE MEETING PLACE]    If possible, let the \"sing\" be held, in some hall not connected with  any particular group of people, so that all may feel equally at home  (there are decided objections to using either a church or a lodge  room); and, in giving the invitation for the first meeting, make sure  that no group of people shall have any ground whatsoever for feeling  slighted, even in the smallest degree.    Granting the various factors that we have been recommending, and, most  important of all, having provided the right type of leader to take  charge of the \"sings,\" the enterprise cannot but have significant  results along both musical and sociological lines.          CHAPTER X    THE ORCHESTRAL CONDUCTOR      [Sidenote: DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN CONDUCTING A LARGE ORCHESTRA]    Conducting an orchestra from full score is a vastly more complicated  matter than directing a chorus singing four-part music, and the  training necessary in order to prepare one for this task is long and  complicated. In addition to the points already rehearsed as necessary  for the conductor in general, the leader of an orchestra must in the  first place know at least superficially the method of playing the  chief orchestral instruments, the advantages and disadvantages  involved in using their various registers, the difficulties of certain  kinds of execution, and other similar matters which are often referred  to by the term _instrumentation_. In the second place, he must  understand the combinations of these various instruments that are most  effective, and also what registers in certain instruments blend well  with others; in other words, he must be familiar with the science of  _orchestration_. In the third place, he must understand the  complicated subject of _transposing instruments_, and must be able to  detect a player's mistakes by reading the transposed part as readily  as any other. And finally, he must be able to perform that most  difficult task of all, _viz._, to read an orchestral score with at  least a fair degree of ease, knowing at all times what each performer  is supposed to be playing and whether he is doing the right thing or  not. This implies being able to look at the score as a whole and get a  fairly definite impression of the total effect; but it also involves  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22396"],[0,"King Arthur's Knights (#18)"],[1,"Sir  Marhaus, and he feared much that he would have to part with his gold.    Daily Sir Marhaus sent a message up to the castle gate, demanding  payment of the truage, or that a knight should come forth to do battle  against him.    Then King Mark let make a proclamation through all the lands, that if a  knight would fight to save the truage of Cornwall he should fare the  better as long as he lived. But the days and weeks went by and no  knight came forward. Then Sir Marhaus sent at the last a message which  said, that if within a day and a night a champion for King Mark came  not forward, he should depart.    All that day King Mark was sore and ill of mind and haggard of face,  and could never stay still, but was for ever faring with his barons to  where he could look down upon the ship of Sir Marhaus, and see the  knight waiting in his armour.    Late in the afternoon, as the king stood thus, gnawing his nails for  rage, and so hot and wrathful that none of his barons dare speak to  him, there came two horsemen riding swiftly into the courtyard of the  castle, and at the sound of their horses' feet King Mark turned  eagerly.    A young squire was the foremost rider, and he was a youth full handsome  and tall, with brown curly hair and blue eyes. He was dressed in a  surcoat of red satin and a mantle of crimson, trimmed with gold; and on  his head was a cap of rich purple, and his feet and legs were clad in  fine leather, with gold bosses on his shoes. Alighting easily, he  doffed his hat and came towards the king:    'Sir,' said he, 'if ye will give me the order of knighthood, I shall do  battle to the uttermost with Sir Marhaus of Ireland.'    King Mark looked the young man up and down, and saw that though he was  young of age, yet he was passing well made of body, with broad  shoulders and of big limbs. The heart of King Mark became light.    'Fair son,' he said, and his barons marvelled at his soft words, 'what  are ye and whence come ye?'    'Sir,' said the youth, 'I come from King Talloch, Prince of Lyones, and  I am a gentleman's son.'    'And your name and birthplace--what are they?'    'My name is Tristram, sir, and I was born in Lyones.'    'Young sir,' said the king, 'I like your manner, and I think ye should  be a good man of your hands. Therefore will I make you knight if ye  will fight with Sir Marhaus.'    'That is why I have come,' said Tristram.    Eagerly the king bade a baron give him his sword, and commanded  Tristram to kneel, and then and there he tapped his shoulder with the  flat of the sword and bade him rise, 'Sir Tristram of Lyones.'    The king commanded his scrivener to come to him, and on the low wall  overlooking the sea the man of inkhorn and goosequill laid his  parchment, and wrote a letter to Sir Marhaus at the king's dictation,  saying that a knight would battle with him in the morning. A messenger  was sent therewith without delay, and the king went into supper,  snapping his fingers and joking with his barons in great glee.    But in the midst of supper a parchment was brought to the king and his  face fell, and he commanded the new-made knight to come from his seat  and stand before him.    'Hark ye,' he said, his face dark, 'this prideful Sir Marhaus, waiting  so long, hath made his terms the harder. I fear, good fellow, your  knighthood hath been earned of me too easily, even if ye are not in  league with this pesky Irish knight,' he went on, his narrow eyes  gleaming with suspicion. 'He sayeth now that he will not fight with any  knight unless he be of blood royal on his mother's side or father's.  Say, are ye some starveling knight's brat, or what are ye?'    Sir Tristram's face went hard and his eyes flashed.    'No starveling's brat am I, king,' he said, 'unless ye are that  thyself.'    'What mean you? Have a care of your saucy tongue.'    'I fear thee not,' laughed Sir Tristram, 'but this I would have you  know. I am thy nephew, son of thy sister Elizabeth, who died in the  forest, and of King Talloch of Lyones.'    At these words the king rose from his seat and embraced Sir Tristram,  crying:    'Now, in the name of Heaven, thou art right heartily welcome unto me,  dear nephew.'    That evening he made great cheer of Sir Tristram, and had his bed made  next to his own in his own royal chamber. On the morrow the king had  Sir Tristram horsed and armed in the best manner. Then he sent a  trumpeter down to the seashore, and let Sir Marhaus know that a better  born man than he was himself would fight with him, and that his name  was Sir Tristram of Lyones, son of the King of Lyones and his queen  Elizabeth, King Mark's sister. Sir Marhaus was right blithe that he  should have to do with such a gentleman.    Then it was ordained that the two knights should battle on a little  island near the ship of Sir Marhaus, and so young Sir Tristram and his  squire were rowed thereunto, and when he departed, King Mark and his  barons and all the common people were rejoiced to see the young  knight's noble and high bearing, and wished him Godspeed.    When Sir Tristram landed he saw Sir Marhaus waiting armed in the shadow  of his ship. Sir Tristram's squire brought his master's horse to land,  and clad his master in his armour as was right, and then the young  knight mounted upon his horse and rode towards Sir Marhaus.    While he was as yet six spear-lengths from him the knight of the Round  Table cried unto him:    'Young knight, Sir Tristram, what doest thou here? I grieve me of thy  courage, for ye are untried, while I have been well essayed in jousts  and tournaments with some of the best men of their hands as are now  living. I counsel thee to go back.'    'Fair and well-proved knight,' said Sir Tristram, 'I am for thy sake  made knight, and I have promised to fight thee, and I will do so, as  much for mine uncle's sake as for what worship I may win from doing  battle with ye, who are one of the best renowned knights of the world.'    'Then I would have ye know, fair sir,' said Sir Marhaus, 'that no  worship shalt thou lose if thou canst only stand against three strokes  of mine, for, by reason of my noble deeds, seen and proved, King Arthur  made me knight of the Round Table.'    Sir Tristram answered him naught, and then they dressed their spears  and spurred their horses, and ran so fiercely each against the other  that both were smitten to the ground, both horses and men. But Sir  Marhaus had struck a great wound in the side of Sir Tristram, yet so  eager was the young knight that he knew not of it. They leaped up and  avoided their horses, and drew out their swords, and with shield on arm  they lashed at each other like fierce wild boars. Yet for all Sir  Marhaus' strong and bitter strokes he could not beat down the young  knight's guard, and in despite he began to aim at his vizor and his  neck. At this Sir Tristram was wroth, and struck him more furiously.  Thus for two hours the battle waged, and both were sore wounded. But  Sir Tristram was the fresher and better winded and bigger of limb and  reach; and suddenly he heaved his sword up high, and closing upon Sir  Marhaus he smote him with so mighty a buffet upon his helm that the  blade shore through the steel even into the brain-pan.    So fierce had been the stroke that the sword stuck fast in the bone and  the helmet, and Sir Tristram pulled thrice at his sword before it would  loosen. Sir Marhaus sank to his knees with a deathly groan; then he  threw away his sword and shield, and rising, staggered away towards his  ship. Sir Tristram swooned and fell; and his squire came running to  him, just as the men of Sir Marhaus' ship came and drew their master on  board. Then they swiftly set their sail and flew over the sea.    Great was the mourning of the barons and the people of Cornwall when it  was known how deep and wide was the wound which Tristram had received  from the lance of Sir Marhaus. Many famous leeches came and searched  the wound and strove to close it, but none availed. When two months had  passed, came an old, old woman, a witch wise in leechcraft beyond all  others, who was called the Mother of the Mists, and who lived in the  Great Shuddering Moor, where only trolls dwelled, and no man ever dared  to go. She also came and searched his wound at the king's desire.    When she had made her search, with many mumblings and strange words,  she turned and looked keenly at the king. Her eyes gleamed like beads,  her skin was wrinkled and dark, and she laughed a little soft laugh.    'Lord king,' she said, 'this fine man's wound is poisoned, and naught  can heal it this side the great water. But if he goeth whither the  spear came from which poisoned it, he shall get whole of that wound.'    ''Tis well,' said the king, 'he shall be sent to Ireland.'    'Ay, ay, ay,' said the old woman, and laughed in Sir Tristram's face.  'Thou shalt be healed, fair chief, but the hand that shall heal thee  shall give thee a deeper wound--a wound that shall never be healed this  side o' thy grave.'    Forthwith King Mark let a fair ship be purveyed and well stored with  necessary victuals, and Sir Tristram was carried thereto and laid on  his couch on the deck, and Governale, his faithful squire, went with  him. In the sunshine and the brisk wind Sir Tristram felt joyful, and  the merry waves slapped the sides of the ship full prettily as it  cleaved through the blue seas towards the west.    In the evening they saw the white cliffs and the brown rocks of  Ireland, and Sir Tristram took his harp and played thereon, for he had  learned to harp most featly in France, where he had lived seven years,  to learn all manner of courtly and noble pastimes. Soon the shipmen  cast anchor in a wide sheltered cove beneath a castle which stood on a  high rock beside a fair town.    Sir Tristram asked the master of the ship the name of that town.    'Cro-na-Shee, if it please you, my lord,' said the master.    'It pleases me well,'"]]]
