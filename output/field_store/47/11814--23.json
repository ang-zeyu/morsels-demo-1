For the soldier the whole moral question had been decided; his  duty was so clear that he never needed to hesitate. And his blood would  have been sluggish indeed who must not have been stirred to the heart by  these inspiring circumstances: whether in camp, where the population of  a town was housed and fed in an hour, every man charged with some duty  for the common benefit, the whole a pattern of social administration; or  on the march, with the scouts and patrols opening and spreading in  advance and covering every patch of ground for miles round, the sweep  and imposing measure of the marching troops, the miles of supply and  baggage waggons, each in its appointed place; or on the battlefield,  where troops were handled and manoeuvred as on a chessboard, where men  went to death with light hearts, lying for perhaps hours under fire,  stealing a piece of ground here or a bit of cover there, with one eye on  their officer and another on the flash before them, and perhaps a  thought in the middle of it all for someone at home--there, indeed,  where stern duties were faithfully fulfilled was set a great example.  Fortunately for some of us at home the men who direct and conduct our  battles are magnanimous, and one had the gratification of seeing, even  upon occasions so savage, little acts of courtesy and humanity rendered  on both sides that went far to take the sting out of a defeat.    And let there be no mistake about the Boers as soldiers. In spite of the  far too numerous abuses of the rules of civilised warfare by detached  and independent combatants--abuses, it should be remembered, that have  occurred and will occur in every war and in the ranks of every army  --our officers and men have a genuine respect and admiration for their  enemy. No one looked upon death at their hands as anything but  honourable. And as one's admiration and sympathy were stirred for one's  own fellow-countrymen, who so unflinchingly performed their duties,  could one withhold it from that other army five miles away across the  plain--citizen soldiers fighting for their country and their homes? For  the soldier politics do not exist; he fights and dies for an idea. This  is mere sentiment, you may say, instead of fact about arms and battles;  yet the hardest fact that rings beneath your stamp is no more real than  poor, flimsy sentiment, which is a living force in the world, and will  remain to be reckoned with when pom-poms and Creusots are rusting in  archaeological museums--monuments only to the mechanical and political  clumsiness of the nineteenth century.          XIV    THE CAPTURE OF BOERS AT TWEEFONTEIN      Lord Methuen had not long to wait for occupation. As soon as he arrived  at Boshof he posted his pickets on every possible point of vantage, and  patrolled the neighbourhood of Boshof over a wide circumference; and he  was rewarded. The little engagement at Tweefontein was, we all hoped, an  auspicious beginning for Lord Methuen's advance. If one might apply the  word to military tactics, it was as artistic a piece of work as could  be. I do not remember a single mistake or an instance of anything less  well or less quickly done than was possible. The result was a raising of  everyone's spirits, and I thought that Lord Methuen himself had the air  of a man emerging from depression. Certainly no general was better liked  by those around him, and, in spite of all mischievous gossip to the  contrary, he was perfectly trusted by his officers and men.    [Illustration: LIEUT.-GEN. LORD METHUEN, K.C.V.O., C.B., C.M.G.]    On Friday morning, April 6th, a native guide came in with information  that the enemy had a laager at a farm called Tweefontein, nine miles  south-east of Boshof. In ten minutes Major Streatfeild had his horse  packed and saddled and was off to the Yeomanry camp. Now the Yeomanry  horses were out on the plain grazing a good mile away; yet from the time  when the order was given until the moment of starting exactly  thirty-five minutes elapsed--a performance that would not have disgraced  veterans. The artillery and the Kimberley Mounted Corps (an excellent  force, although not so well horsed as the Yeomanry) were ready in the  same time, and the force started in the following order: Scouts of the  Kimberley Mounted Corps; advance guard ditto; Staff; Imperial Yeomanry,  under Lord Chesham; Fourth Company Royal Artillery; Kimberley Mounted  Corps, under Lieut.-Colonel Peakman.    When the force was within three miles of Tweefontein the scouts  returned, stating that the only kopje in the neighbourhood was held by  the enemy. The native guides had led us by an excellent road and with  absolute accuracy, and the enemy had no idea of our presence until we  came up over the ridge and showed our force in the centre. Lord Methuen  then developed his attack, which, as the kopje was isolated, was on the  simple plan of a centre with two extending wings. There was a delay in  the centre until Captain Rolleston's (Lieutenant-Colonel commanding  Nottinghamshire Yeomanry) company, under Lord Scarborough, could get  into position on the left. The enemy opened fire without delay, so the  Yeomanry had to make a wide detour. Meanwhile the centre was held back  while the Kimberley Mounted Corps, under Colonel Peakman, were sent to  the right, where they found cover in a ridge of very low kopjes.    When both flanks were in position the main body of Yeomanry dismounted  and advanced towards the kopje in extended order. Now was their time.  You must remember that this was their baptism of fire, and everyone was  on the look-out for signs of \"greenness\"; everyone had more or less been  making fun of them in a mild way, and prophesying all sorts of disaster.  As they advanced the bullets began to pipe on the edge of the  firing-zone, but there was not a bit of change in the Yeomanry when they  came under fire. I know from experience how disconcerting it is to ride  into the zone of fire, and walking must be much worse. It is not half so  bad when you are fairly in; it is like wading into a cold and shallow  sea instead of plunging--a kind of shivering sensation, most unpleasant.  Well, they went through this nasty belt as coolly as you please--no  hurry or funk. They dropped like wax when the order came to lie down,  and fired steadily.    The whole of our little field was now under fire, and the cavalry on  each side were keeping the Boers very busy. All the time the right and  left flanks were opening out and reaching towards each other behind the  kopje. The only disappointment was that the artillery could not get to  work; the rise of the ground was so great and we had covered the  position so completely that it was rather dangerous to attempt shelling.  For about two hours there was hot firing, and every now and then there  was a little work for our ambulance people, but not much. The only  noticeable evidence of inexperience on the part of the Yeomanry was that  they did not realise--and no one can realise this when fighting the  Boers for the first time--how great is the enemy's firing range, and how  far away one must keep to be able to live at all. They kept pressing  forward, and Major Streatfeild had to ride across from the General under  a very hot fire to tell them to keep back.    Towards the end of the engagement there was a gap in front of the  artillery position, and the guns spoke. They got the range at once, and  fired three rounds of shrapnel, and a few minutes after the third round  had been fired a white flag was waved from the hill. Silence fell like a  shadow over the place that had been crackling with fire a minute before;  people who had been lying flat on the ground stood up and stretched  themselves; and in the midst of the silence a shot cracked from the  hill, and there was a rush of men towards a prostrate body on our side.  Then another shot cracked--from our side this time; the treacherous  Boer, I was told, fell dead, and the action was over.    We captured fifty-two prisoners, and the Boers had eight killed and six  wounded. No one escaped. They all laid down their arms and surrendered,  handing over also a cart of dynamite. From this it was gathered that  General Villebois (who was killed) had been trying to get behind us to  the railway line near Modder River, where he hoped to destroy it. I  spoke to some of the prisoners next day--Frenchmen, many of them, and  nice enough fellows. I heard then something which gave me pause with  regard to the white flag. When the thing happened it appeared to be a  flagrant and indubitable case of treachery; everyone was speaking of it.  But one of the prisoners, in talking to me, referred to the \"rascal\" who  showed the flag.    \"We had no intention to surrender,\" he said; \"no order was given; that  worm had a flag in his pocket, and he held it up; poor ---- (mentioning  the man who shot and was killed) probably never saw it. It's a wonder  half of us did not go on firing.\"    I give this statement for what it is worth. \"All lies\" was the comment  of some of the officers there, and quite possibly they were right; but  quite possibly also they were wrong, and the whole thing was an  accident. At least one may learn a lesson from it. I hated to believe  it, but I believed it to be treachery. Now it turns out that I may have  been unjust, and possibly on a dozen other occasions the same sort of  involuntary injustice may have been done to our enemies. Certainly it is  much easier for soldiers to see a small conspicuous object when it is  displayed by the enemy than when it is displayed by one of their own  side. The men on either side are intent upon watching the other side,  not their own.    In General Villebois de Mareuil's pocket was found a note-book  containing a cleverly planned diagram of an attack on Boshof, and when  the sun was setting he was buried in the town he had hoped to enter  victoriously. It was a most impressive "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2391"],[0,"Bruce (#18)"],[1,"afresh to get at his vanished quarry. And again the Sergeant  had a tussle to hold him.    \"I don't know what's got into the big fellow!\" exclaimed Mahan to  Vivier as the old Frenchman joined the tumultuous group. \"He's gone  clean daft. He'd of killed that poor woman, if I hadn't--\"    \"Get him out of here!\" ordered the surgeon. \"And clear out, yourselves,  all of you! This rumpus has probably set a lot of my patients'  temperatures to rocketing. Take the cur out and shoot him!\"    \"Excuse me, sir,\" spoke up Mahan, as Vivier stared aghast at the man  who commanded Bruce's destruction, \"but he's no cur. He's a  courier-collie, officially in the service of the United States  Government. And he's the best courier-dog in France to-day. This is--\"    \"I don't care what he is!\" raged the surgeon. \"He--\"    \"This is Bruce,\" continued Mahan, \"the dog that saved the  'Here-We-Comes' at Rache, and that steered a detail of us to safety one  night in the fog, in the Chateau-Thierry sector. If you order any man  of the 'Here-We-Comes' to shoot Bruce, you're liable to have a mutiny  on your hands--officer or no officer. But if you wish, sir, I can  transmit your order to the K.O. If he endorses it--\"    But the surgeon sought, at that moment, to save the remnants of his  dignity and of a bad situation by stalking loftily back into the  hospital, and leaving Mahan in the middle of his speech.    \"Or, sir,\" the Sergeant grinningly called after him, \"you might write  to the General Commanding, and tell him you want Bruce shot. The Big  Dog always sleeps in the general's own room, when he's off-duty, at  Division Headquarters. Maybe the general will O.K. his death-sentence,  if you ask him to. He--\"    Somewhat quickening his stately stride, the surgeon passed out of  earshot. At the officers' mess of the \"Here-We-Comes,\" he had often  heard Bruce's praises sung. He had never chanced to see the dog until  now. But, beneath his armor of dignity, he quaked to think what the  results to himself must have been, had he obeyed his first impulse of  drawing his pistol and shooting the adored and pricelessly useful  collie.    Mahan,--stolidly rejoicing in his victory over the top-lofty potentate  whom he disliked,--led the way out of the crowded vestibule into the  street. Bruce followed demurely at his heels and Vivier bombarded  everybody in sight for information as to what the whole fracas was  about.    Bruce was himself again. Now that the detested man in woman's clothes  had gone away, there was no sense in continuing to struggle or to waste  energy in a show of fury. Nevertheless, in his big heart burned  deathless hatred toward the German who had kicked him. And, like an  elephant, a collie never forgets.    \"But,\" Vivier was demanding of everybody, \"but why should the gentle  Bruce have attacked a good nurse? It is not what you call 'make-sense.'  C'est un gentilhomme, ce vieux! He would not attack a woman less still  a sister of the Red Cross. He--\"    \"Of course he wouldn't,\" glumly assented the downhearted Mahan. \"But he  DID. That's the answer. I saw him do it. He knocked her down and--\"    \"Which nurse was she?\" asked a soldier who had come up after the  trouble was over.    \"A new one here. I don't know her name. She came last week. I saw her  when she got here. I was on duty at the K.O.'s office when she  reported. She had a letter from some one on the surgeon-general's  staff. But why Bruce should have gone for her to-day--or for any  woman--is more than I can see. She was scared half to death. It's lucky  she heard the surgeon order him shot. She'll suppose he's dead, by now.  And that'll cure her scare. We must try to keep Bruce away from this  end of the street till he goes back to headquarters to-morrow.\"    As a result Bruce was coaxed to Mahan's company-shed and by dint of  food-gifts and petting was induced to spend most of the day there.    At sunset Bruce tired of his dull surroundings. Mahan had gone on duty;  so had Vivier; so had others of his friends. The dog was bored and  lonely. Also he had eaten much. And a walk is good, not only for  loneliness, but for settling an overfull stomach. Bruce decided to go  for a walk.    Through the irregular street of the village he picked his way, and on  toward the open country beyond. A sentry or two snapped fingers of  greeting to him as he strolled past them. The folk of the village eyed  his bulk and graceful dignity with something like awe.    Beyond the hamlet the ridge of hilltop ran on for perhaps a  quarter-mile before dipping into the plain below. At one end of this  little plateau a company of infantry was drilling. Bruce recognized  Mahan among the marching lines, but he saw his friend was on duty and  refrained from going up to him.    Above, the sunset sky was cloudless. Like tiny specks, miles to  eastward, a few enemy airships circled above the heap of clustered  hills which marked the nearest German position. The torn-up plain,  between, seemed barren of life. So, at first, did the farther end of  the jutting ridge on which the village was perched. But presently  Bruce's idly wandering eye was caught by a flutter of white among some  boulders that clumped together on the ridge's brow farthest from the  village.    Some one--a woman, from the dress--was apparently picking her way  through the boulders. As Bruce moved forward, a big rock shut her off  from his view and from the view of the hamlet and of the maneuvering  infantry company a furlong away.    Just then a puff of breeze blew from eastward toward the collie; and it  bore to him a faint scent that set his ruff a-bristle and his soft  brown eyes ablaze. To a dog, a scent once smelled is as recognizable  again as is the sight of a once-seen face to a human. Bruce set off at  a hand-gallop toward the clump of boulders.    The Red Cross nurse, whom Bruce had so nearly killed, was off duty  until the night-shift should go on at the hospital. The nurse had taken  advantage of this brief surcease from toil, by going for a little walk  in the cool sunset air, and had carried along a bag of sewing.    Up to three months ago this nurse had been known as Heinrich Stolz, and  had been a valued member of the Wilhelmstrasse's workingforce of secret  agents. Then, acting under orders, Herr Heinrich Stolz had vanished  from his accustomed haunts. Soon thereafter a Red Cross nurse--Felicia  Stuart by name had reported for duty at Paris, having been transferred  thither from Italy, and bearing indubitable credentials to that effect.    From carefully picked-up information Stolz had just learned of the  expected arrival of the three troop-trains at the junction at nine that  evening. The tidings had interested him keenly, and he knew of other  people to whom they would be far more interesting.    Seating himself under the lee of the easternmost rock, Stolz primly  opened his sewing-bag and drew forth various torn garments. The  garments were for the most part white, but one or two were of gaudy  colors.    By way of precaution, in case of discovery, the spy threaded a needle.  Thus, if any one should chance to see him shake out a garment,  preparatory to laying it on his knee and mending it, there could be no  reasonable cause for suspicion. Herr Stolz was nothing if not efficient.    He held up the needle and poked the thread at its eye in truly feminine  fashion.    He had just finished this feat of dexterity when he chanced to look up  from his work at sound of fast-pattering feet. Not thirty feet away,  charging head on at him, rushed the great brown-and-white collie he  supposed had been shot.    With a jump of abject terror, Herr Stolz sprang up. Mingled with his  normal fear of the dog was a tinge of superstitious dread. He had been  so certain the beast was shot! The doctor had given the order for his  killing. The doctor was a commissioned officer. Stolz's German mind  could not grasp the possibility of a soldier disobeying an officer's  imperative command.    The collie was upon him by the time the spy gained his feet. Stolz  reached frantically under his dress-folds for the deadly little pistol  that he always kept there. But he was still a novice in the mysteries  of feminine apparel. And, before his fingers could close on the weapon,  Bruce's bared fangs were gleaming at his throat.    Stolz ceased to search for the weapon. And, as before, he threw up both  frantic hands to ward off the furious jaws.    He was barely in time. Bruce's white teeth drove deep into the spy's  forearm, and Bruce's eighty pounds of furry muscular bulk smote Stolz  full in the chest. Down went the spy, under the terrific impact,  sprawling wildly on his back, and fighting with both bleeding hands to  push back the dog.    Bruce, collie-fashion, did not stick to one grip, but bit and slashed a  dozen times in three seconds, tearing and rending his way toward the  throat-hold he craved; driving through flesh of hands and of forearms  toward his goal.    Like many another German, Stolz was far more adept at causing pain than  at enduring it. Also, from birth, he had had an unconquerable fear of  dogs. His nerves, too, were not yet recovered from Bruce's attack  earlier in the day. All this, and the spectral suddenness of the  onslaught, robbed him of every atom of his usual stony self-control.    Sergeant Mahan was a good soldier. Yet a minute earlier he had almost  ruined his reputation as such. He had been hard put to it to refrain  from leaving the ranks of his drilling company, a furlong from the  rocks, and running at record speed toward the boulders. For he had seen  the supposed nurse pass that way. And almost directly afterward he had  seen Bruce follow her thither. And he could guess what would happen.    Luckily for the sake of discipline, the order of \"Break ranks!\" was  given before Mahan could disgrace himself by such unmartial behavior.  And, on the instant, the Sergeant broke into a run in the"]]]
