Suspended was the widow's tear,    While yet his footsteps she could hear;    And when she marked the henchman's eye                         430    Wet with unwonted sympathy,    \"Kinsman,\" she said, \"his race is run,    That should have sped thine errand on;    The oak has fallen--the sapling bough    Is all Duncraggan's shelter now.                               435    Yet trust I well, his duty done,    The orphan's God will guard my son.    And you, in many a danger true,    At Duncan's hest your blades that drew,    To arms, and guard that orphan's head!                         440    Let babes and women wail the dead.\"    Then weapon-clang and martial call    Resounded through the funeral hall,    While from the walls the attendant band    Snatched sword and targe, with hurried hand;                   445    And short and flitting energy    Glanced from the mourner's sunken eye,    As if the sounds to warrior dear,    Might rouse her Duncan from his bier.    But faded soon that borrowed force;                            450    Grief claimed his right, and tears their course.      XIX      Benledi saw the Cross of Fire;    It glanced like lightning up Strath-Ire.    O'er dale and hill the summons flew,    Nor rest nor pause young Angus knew;                           455    The tear that gathered in his eye    He left the mountain breeze to dry;    Until, where Teith's young waters roll    Betwixt him and a wooded knoll    That graced the sable strath with green,                       460    The chapel of St. Bride was seen.    Swoln was the stream, remote the bridge,    But Angus paused not on the edge;    Though the dark waves danced dizzily,    Though reeled his sympathetic eye,                             465    He dashed amid the torrent's roar.    His right hand high the crosslet bore,    His left the pole-ax grasped, to guide    And stay his footing in the tide.    He stumbled twice--the foam splashed high;                     470    With hoarser swell the stream raced by;    And had he fallen--forever there,    Farewell Duncraggan's orphan heir!    But still, as if in parting life,    Firmer he grasped the Cross of strife,                         475    Until the opposing bank he gained,    And up the chapel pathway strained.      XX      A blithesome rout, that morning tide,    Had sought the chapel of St. Bride.    Her troth Tombea's Mary gave                                   480    To Norman, heir of Armandave.    And, issuing from the Gothic arch,    The bridal now resumed their march.    In rude, but glad procession, came    Bonneted sire and coif-clad dame;                              485    And plaided youth, with jest and jeer,    Which snooden maiden would not hear:    And children, that, unwitting why,    Lent the gay shout their shrilly cry;    And minstrels, that in measures vied                           490    Before the young and bonny bride,    Whose downcast eye and cheek disclose    The tear and blush of morning rose.    With virgin step, and bashful hand,    She held the kerchief's snowy band;                            495    The gallant bridegroom, by her side,    Beheld his prize with victor's pride,    And the glad mother in her ear    Was closely whispering word of cheer.      XXI      Who meets them at the churchyard gate?                         500    The messenger of fear and fate!    Haste in his hurried accent lies,    And grief is swimming in his eyes.    All dripping from the recent flood,    Panting and travel-soiled he stood,                            505    The fatal sign of fire and sword    Held forth, and spoke the appointed word:    \"The muster-place is Lanrick mead;    Speed forth the signal! Norman, speed!\"    And must he change so soon the hand,                           510    Just linked to his by holy band,    For the fell Cross of blood and brand?    And must the day, so blithe that rose    And promised rapture in the close,    Before its setting hour, divide                                515    The bridegroom from the plighted bride?    O fatal doom!--it must! it must!    Clan-Alpine's cause, her Chieftain's trust,    Her summons dread, brook no delay;    Stretch to the race--away! away!                               520      XXII      Yet slow he laid his plaid aside,    And, lingering, eyed his lovely bride,    Until he saw the starting tear    Speak woe he might not stop to cheer;    Then, trusting not a second look,                              525    In haste he sped him up the brook,    Nor backward glanced, till on the heath    Where Lubnaig's lake supplies the Teith.    --What in the racer's bosom stirred?    The sickening pang of hope deferred,                           530    And memory, with a torturing train    Of all his morning visions vain.    Mingled with love's impatience came    The manly thirst for martial fame;    The stormy joy of mountaineers,                                535    Ere yet they rush upon the spears;    And zeal for Clan and Chieftain burning,    And hope, from well-fought field returning,    With war's red honors on his crest,    To clasp his Mary to his breast.                               540    Stung by such thoughts, o'er bank and brae,    Like fire from flint he glanced away,    While high resolve, and feeling strong,    Burst into voluntary song.      XXIII    SONG      The heath this night must be my bed,                           545    The bracken curtain for my head,    My lullaby the warder's tread,          Far, far, from love and thee, Mary;    To-morrow eve, more stilly laid,    My couch may be my bloody plaid,                               550    My vesper song, thy wail, sweet maid!          It will not waken me, Mary!    I may not, dare not, fancy now    The grief that clouds thy lovely brow,    I dare not think upon thy vow,                                 555          And all it promised me, Mary.    No fond regret must Norman know;    When bursts Clan-Alpine on the foe,    His heart must be like bended bow,          His foot like arrow free, Mary.                          560      A time will come with feeling fraught,    For if I fall in battle fought,    Thy hapless lover's dying thought          Shall be a thought on thee, Mary.    And if returned from conquered foes,                           565    How blithely will the evening close,    How sweet the linnet sing repose,          To my young bride and me, Mary!      XXIV      Not faster o'er thy heathery braes,    Balquidder, speeds the midnight blaze,                         570    Rushing, in conflagration strong,    Thy deep ravines and dells along,    Wrapping thy cliffs in purple glow,    And reddening the dark lakes below;    Nor faster speeds it, nor so far,                              575    As o'er thy heaths the voice of war.    The signal roused to martial coil,    The sullen margin of Loch Voil,    Waked still Loch Doine, and to the source    Alarmed, Balvaig, thy swampy course;                           580    Thence southward turned its rapid road    Adown Strath-Gartney's valley broad,    Till rose in arms each man might claim    A portion in Clan-Alpine's name,    From the gray sire, whose trembling hand                       585    Could hardly buckle on his brand,    To the raw boy, whose shaft and bow    Were yet scarce terror to the crow.    Each valley, each sequestered glen,    Mustered its little horde of men,                              590    That met as torrents from the height    In Highland dales their streams unite,    Still gathering, as they pour along,    A voice more loud, a tide more strong,    Till at the rendezvous they stood                              595    By hundreds prompt for blows and blood,    Each trained to arms since life began,    Owning no tie but to his clan,    No oath, but by his chieftain's hand,    No law, but Roderick Dhu's command.                            600      XXV      That summer morn had Roderick Dhu    Surveyed the skirts of Benvenue,    And sent his scouts o'er hill and heath,    To view the frontiers of Menteith.    All backward came with news of truce;                          605    Still lay each martial Graeme and Bruce;    In Rednoch courts no horsemen wait,    No banner waved on Cardross gate,    On Duchray's towers no beacon shone,    Nor scared the herons from Loch Con;                           610    All seemed at peace. Now wot ye why    The Chieftain, with such anxious eye,    Ere to the muster he repair,    This western frontier scanned with care?    In Benvenue's most darksome cleft,                             615    A fair, though cruel, pledge was left;    For Douglas, to his promise true,    That morning from the isle withdrew,    And in a deep sequestered dell    Had sought a low and lonely cell.                              620    By many a bard, in Celtic tongue,    Has Coir-nan-Uriskin been sung;    A softer name the Saxons gave,    And called the grot the Goblin-cave.      XXVI      It was a wild and strange retreat,                             625    As e'er was trod by outlaw's feet.    The dell, upon the mountain's crest,    Yawned like a gash on warrior's breast;    Its trench had stayed full many a rock,    Hurled by primeval earthquake shock                            630    From Benvenue's gray summit wild,    And here, in random ruin piled,    They frowned incumbent o'er the spot,    And formed the rugged silvan grot.    The oak and birch, with mingled shade,                         635    At noontide there a twilight made,    Unless when short and sudden shone    Some straggling beam on cliff or stone,    With such a glimpse as prophet's eye    Gains on thy depth, Futurity.                                  640    No murmur waked the solemn still,    Save tinkling of a fountain rill;    But when the wind chafed with the lake,    A sullen sound would upward break,    With dashing hollow voice, that spoke                      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2832"],[0,"Myth, Ritual and Religion, Vol. 1 (of 2) (#18)"],[1,"family is permitted to use as food the  animal from which it derives its name. We have seen that a similar rule  prevails, as far as hunger and scarcity of victuals permit it to be  obeyed, among the natives of Australia. The Intchwa stock in Ashantee  and Fantee is particularly unlucky, because its members may not eat  the dog, \"much relished by native epicures, and therefore a serious  privation\". Equally to be pitied were the ancient Egyptians, who, if  they belonged to the district of the sheep, might not eat mutton,  which their neighbours, the Lycopolitae, devoured at pleasure. These  restrictions appear to be connected with the almost universal dislike  of cannibals to eat persons of their own kindred except as a pious  duty. This law of the game in cannibalism has not yet been thoroughly  examined, though we often hear of wars waged expressly for the purpose  of securing food (human meat), while some South American tribes  actually bred from captive women by way of securing constant supplies of  permitted flesh.(3) When we find stocks, then, which derive their names  from animals and decline to eat these animals, we may at least SUSPECT  that they once claimed kinship with the name-giving beasts. The refusal  to eat them raises a presumption of such faith. Old Bosman(4) had  noticed the same practices. \"One eats no mutton, another no goat's  flesh, another no beef, swine's flesh, wild fowl, cocks with white  feathers, and they say their ancestors did so from the beginning of the  world.\"      (1) The evidence of native interpreters may be viewed with suspicion.  It is improbable, however, that in 1817 the interpreters were  acquainted with the totemistic theory of mythologists, and deliberately  mistranslated the names of the stocks, so as to make them harmonise with  Indian, Australian, and Red Indian totem kindreds. This, indeed, is an  example where the criterion of \"recurrence\" or \"coincidence\" seems to be  valuable. Bowditch's Mission to Ashantee (1873), p. 181.    (2) This view, however, does not prevail among the totemistic tribes of  British Columbia, for example.    (3) Cieza de Leon (Hakluyt Society), p. 50. This amazing tale is  supported by the statement that kinship went by the female side (p.  49); the father was thus not of the kin of his child by the alien woman.  Cieza was with Validillo in 1538.    (4) In Pinkerton, xvi. 400.      While in the case of the Ashantee tribes, we can only infer the  existence of a belief in kinship with the animals from the presence  of the other features of fully developed totemism (especially from the  refusal to eat the name-giving animal), we have direct evidence for the  opinion in another part of Africa, among the Bechuanas.(1) Casalis,  who passed twenty-three years as a missionary in South Africa, thus  describes the institution: \"While the united communities usually bear  the name of their chief or of the district which they inhabit\" (local  tribes, as in Australia), \"each stock (tribu) derives its title from  an animal or a vegetable. All the Bechuanas are subdivided thus into  Bakuenas (crocodile-men), Batlapis (men of the fish), Banarer (of the  buffalo), Banukus (porcupines), Bamoraras (wild vines), and so forth.  The Bakuenas call the crocodile their father, sing about him in their  feasts, swear by him, and mark the ears of their cattle with an incision  which resembles the open jaws of the creature.\" This custom of marking  the cattle with the crest, as it were, of the stock, takes among some  races the shape of deforming themselves, so as the more to resemble the  animal from which they claim descent. \"The chief of the family which  holds the chief rank in the stock is called 'The Great Man of the  Crocodile'. Precisely in the same way the Duchess of Sutherland is  styled in Gaelic 'The Great Lady of the Cat,'\" though totemism is  probably not the origin of this title.      (1) E. Casalis, Les Bassoutos, 1859.      Casalis proceeds: \"No one would dare to eat the flesh or wear the skin  of the animal whose name he bears. If the animal be dangerous--the  lion, for example--people only kill him after offering every apology and  asking his pardon. Purification must follow such a sacrifice.\" Casalis  was much struck with the resemblance between these practices and the  similar customs of North American races. Livingstone's account(1) on the  whole corroborates that of Casalis, though he says the Batau (tribe  of the lion) no longer exists. \"They use the word bina 'to dance,' in  reference to the custom of thus naming themselves, so that when you wish  to ascertain what tribe they belong to, you say, 'What do you dance?'  It would seem as if this had been part of the worship of old.\" The  mythological and religious knowledge of the Bushmen is still imparted in  dances; and when a man is ignorant of some myth he will say, \"I do not  dance that dance,\" meaning that he does not belong to the guild which  preserves that particular \"sacred chapter\".(2)      (1) Missionary Travels (1857), p. 13.    (2) Orpen, Cape Monthly Magazine, 1872.      Casalis noticed the similarity between South African and Red Indian  opinion about kinship with vegetables and beasts. The difficulty in  treating the Red Indian belief is chiefly found in the abundance of the  evidence. Perhaps the first person who ever used the word \"totemism,\"  or, as he spells it, \"totamism,\" was (as we said) Mr. Long, an  interpreter among the Chippeways, who published his Voyages in 1791.  Long was not wholly ignorant of the languages, as it was his business to  speak them, and he was an adopted Indian. The ceremony of adoption was  painful, beginning with a feast of dog's flesh, followed by a Turkish  bath and a prolonged process of tattooing.(1) According to Long,(2)  \"The totam, they conceive, assumes the form of some beast or other, and  therefore they never kill, hurt, or eat the animal whose form they think  this totam bears\". One man was filled with religious apprehensions, and  gave himself up to the gloomy belief of Bunyan and Cowper, that he had  committed the unpardonable sin, because he dreamed he had killed his  totem, a bear.(3) This is only one example, like the refusal of the  Osages to kill the beavers, with which they count cousins,(4) that the  Red Man's belief is an actual creed, and does influence his conduct.      (1) Long, pp. 46-49.    (2) Ibid., p. 86.    (3) Ibid., p. 87.    (4) Schoolcraft, i. 319.      As in Australia, the belief in common kin with beasts is most clearly  proved by the construction of Red Indian society. The \"totemistic\" stage  of thought and manners prevails. Thus Charlevoix says,(1) \"Plusieurs  nations ont chacune trois familles ou tribus principales, AUSSI  ANCIENNES, A CE QU'IL PAROIT, QUE LEUR ORIGINE. Chaque tribu porte le  nom d'un animal, et la nation entiere a aussi le sien, dont elle  prend le nom, et dont la figure est sa marque, ou, se l'on veut, ses  armoiries, on ne signe point autrement les traites qu'en traceant ces  figures.\" Among the animal totems Charlevoix notices porcupine, bear,  wolf and turtle. The armoiries, the totemistic heraldry of the peoples  of Virginia, greatly interested a heraldic ancestor of Gibbon the  historian,(2) who settled in the colony. According to Schoolcraft,(3)  the totem or family badge, of a dead warrior is drawn in a reverse  position on his grave-post. In the same way the leopards of England are  drawn reversed on the shield of an English king opposite the mention  of his death in old monkish chronicles. As a general rule,(4) persons  bearing the same totem in America cannot intermarry. \"The union must be  between various totems.\" Moreover, as in the case of the Australians,  \"the descent of the chief is in the female line\". We thus find among  the Red Men precisely the same totemistic regulations as among the  Aborigines of Australia. Like the Australians, the Red Men \"never\"  (perhaps we should read \"hardly ever\") eat their totems. Totemists,  in short, spare the beasts that are their own kith and kin. To avoid  multiplying details which all corroborate each other, it may suffice to  refer to Schoolcraft for totemism among the Iowas(5) and the Pueblos;(6)  for the Iroquois, to Lafitau, a missionary of the early part of the  eighteenth century. Lafitau was perhaps the first writer who ever  explained certain features in Greek and other ancient myths and  practices as survivals from totemism. The Chimera, a composite creature,  lion, goat and serpent, might represent, Lafitau thought, a league  of three totem tribes, just as wolf, bear and turtle represented the  Iroquois League.      (1) Histoire de la France-Nouvelle, iii. 266.    (2) Introductio ad Latinam Blasoniam, by John Gibbon, Blue Mantle,  London, 1682. \"The dancers, were painted some party per pale, gul and  sab, some party per fesse of the same colours;\" whence Gibbon concluded  \"that heraldry was ingrafted naturally into the sense of the humane  race\".    (3) Vol. i. p. 356.    (4) Schoolcraft, v. 73.    (5) Ibid., iii. 268.    (6) Ibid., iv. 86.      The martyred Pere Rasles, again, writing in 1723,(1) says that one stock  of the Outaonaks claims descent from a hare (\"the great hare was a man  of prodigious size\"), while another stock derive their lineage from the  carp, and a third descends from a bear; yet they do not scruple, after  certain expiatory rites, to eat bear's flesh. Other North American  examples are the Kutchin, who have always possessed the system of  totems.(2)      (1) Kip's Jesuits in America i. 33.    (2) Dall's Alaska, pp. 196-198.      It is to be noticed, as a peculiarity of Red Indian totemism which we  have not observed (though it may exist) in Africa, that certain stocks  claim relations with the sun. Thus Pere Le Petit, writing from New  Orleans in 1730, mentions the Sun, or great chief of the Natchez  Indians.(1) The totem of the privileged class among the Natchez was the  sun, and in all myths the"]]]
