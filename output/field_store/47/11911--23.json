He was also a  solo violinist of rare powers; often thrilling his audiences by the  smooth, sweet, and expressive strains evolved from his instrument.    Cleveland O. Luca, the justly celebrated, the wonderful pianist, began  to exhibit extraordinary talent at the early age of seven years. It  was not, however, the intention of his parents to have him begin to  study so early. Indeed, little did they think that the fire of musical  genius burned so brightly in the soul of their young boy. But  Cleveland, or \"Cleve\" as he was then called, was not to be restrained.  Going often into the room where his aunt was playing on the  piano-forte, he listened eagerly and delightedly, his little soul  stirred and filled by the sweet sounds of harmony; and, after she had  left the instrument, he would go and play the selections even better  than his aunt. Of course such striking evidences of genius filled the  breasts of his parents with delightful surprise; and it was soon  decided to place the gifted boy under the care of a competent  instructor. He rapidly developed those remarkable powers for ready  reading, facility and brilliancy in execution, that afterwards made  him so wonderful and so noted.    When but ten years old, he had become a performer of such excellence  as to attract the notice and to receive the unequivocal praise of such  good judges as Strakosch, Dodworth, W.V. Wallace, and other noted  musicians of New York.    When it was resolved to form as public performers the \"Luca family,\"  the decided musical powers possessed by young Cleveland made his  services indispensable, and he was of course taken as a member. As  the \"wonderful boy pianist,\" he everywhere created quite a _furore_.  The ladies in the audiences were especially delighted with him; and  forgetting often, in their enthusiasm, that he was black, it seemed  that they would certainly carry him away.    Never satisfied to rest alone upon his fine natural endowments, our  young artist pushed his studies, entering the classical, the technical  domain of the great master-composers, and playing with easy, graceful,  magnetic touch, and delightfully winning expression, any of their  works. As a reader at sight of compositions the most difficult, it is  doubtful whether he had an equal in this country.    The prejudiced or incredulous, before having observed his rare powers  for reading and playing, often as a test, and sometimes with a hope to  embarrass him, placed before him some technical and very difficult  work. But the readiness with which he played the piece changed one who  had come to doubt or to scorn into a silent, deeply surprised, and  interested listener; and it was most always the case, too, that such a  one, yielding to the exquisite charm of the music, as well as to the  gentlemanly, graceful manners of the young virtuoso, became from that  time forth his warm admirer and friend.    But this brilliant artist did not confine himself to the  interpretation of the more difficult compositions for the piano. At  the time of which I am writing,--twenty years ago,--his success as a  performer before miscellaneous audiences could not have been so great,  had he not possessed, in a most pleasing degree, a versatility of  talent. His _repertoire_ was an extensive one, and decidedly \"taking\"  in the varied character of its excellent pieces. Many of the latter  were simple, yet always purely musical, and of course highly pleasing.    Before the public, Mr. Luca was, in the best sense, a successful  performer; while, in those smaller and finer artistic circles where  the more delicate and higher musical forms were appreciated, he  delighted and even instructed his listeners, receiving their warmest  praise.    _True_ art is ever noble and ennobling: in its domain its devotees are  known and valued, not by the color of their faces, but by the depth of  artistic love that they feel, and by the measure of success to which  they attain. And so the subject of this sketch, although of a  complexion quite dark, and often suffering from the coldness, if not  the insults, of those afflicted with \"color-phobia,\" was yet ever  sought after and cordially received upon terms of equality by all the  _great_ musicians wherever he journeyed. Nor did the press of the  country, nor people of culture generally, fail to pass upon him the  highest encomiums. A few of these are elsewhere given.    Besides his ability as a pianist, Cleveland Luca was also a vocalist  of fair powers. No especial pains being taken, however, to develop  this faculty, he attracted, as a singer, no great attention.    On the 27th of March, 1872, in far-away Africa, whither he had nobly  gone to carry the bright, cheering, and refining light of his musical  genius, his frail constitution yielding to a fever, he died at the age  of forty-five.    It is hard to over-estimate the great good this remarkable artist  accomplished for his much-abused race in dissipating, by his wonderful  musical qualities, the unjust and cruel prejudice that so generally  prevailed against the former at the beginning of his career; for in  him was fully and splendidly illustrated the capacity of the dark-hued  race for reaching the highest positions in the walks of the art  melodious. The example, moreover, of his intelligent parents, who,  when they discovered his talents,--avoiding the mistake often made by  some, who, alas! but too frequently rest content merely with observing  the signs of genius in their children, allowing the at first bright  spark to go untended, to burn \"with fitful glare,\" and to finally  become, from this neglect, extinguished,--devoted themselves at once  to their fullest and most artistic development,--this example, I say,  is one to be highly commended, and ever to be followed.    Having thus described the family individually, I now proceed to speak  of their combined efforts. Formed as a vocal quartet, the parts were  distributed in this wise: Simeon Luca sang first tenor, Alexander  second tenor, Cleveland soprano, and John sang bass (or baritone if  desired).    Instrumentally they performed as follows: Simeon on first violin,  Alexander second violin, John violoncello (or double bass if  required), and Cleveland on the piano-forte. The father fulfilled the  duties of musical director and business manager; and occasionally he  took part in the performances as a vocalist.    Thus excellently equipped musically, each member of the troupe  possessed of general intelligence, and being of genteel appearance,  they went forth on their mission of music into fields hitherto  untrodden by members of their race; and their fine performances  everywhere gave delight, refinement, and a new and high impulse, to  the many thousands who heard them.    Their services were at first called into requisition at anniversaries  and festivals, and they soon acquired an excellent local reputation.  The event that most prominently heralded their names before the public  was their first appearance at the May anniversary of the Antislavery  Society, held in the old Tabernacle on Broadway, New York, in 1853.  Over five thousand persons were present. The sensation produced by the  performances of this gifted family on this occasion is said to have  been indescribable. The wildest enthusiasm was manifested; and many  persons in the audience, overcome by the emotions awakened, shed  tears. This is, however, not so strange. Gathered as was this immense  concourse of people to advance the cause of human freedom, and  entertaining and asserting, as they did, a belief of man's equality,  we may well imagine the measure of their delight when in witnessing  the display of genius by the wonderful pianist, and listening to the  sweet strains of classical harmony formed by the tuneful voices and  skilfully-played instruments of this troupe of colored artists, they  found their claims for the race so fully sustained.    After the performances just mentioned, letters full of praise and  congratulation from many sources poured in upon the \"Lucas,\" as they  were familiarly called; and Professor Allen, then editing a paper at  Troy, N.Y., induced the parents to intrust the children, now so  rapidly acquiring fame, to his charge, to make a musical trip through  the New-England States in the interest of his paper. This tour  resulted in adding to their fame, and confirming them in a belief of  their ultimate general success; but, owing to poor management on the  part of their business agent, the trip was not a financial success.    I should have mentioned ere this that John and Alexander Luca had been  taught by their father the shoemaking trade, and that for some time  they applied themselves to this kind of work; using their leisure  time, nevertheless, in pushing their musical studies. Occasionally  they would drop the awl and hammer, and make excursions into the  country towns of Connecticut; sometimes returning with a full  exchequer, and sometimes in debt even, but never without having added  to their reputations as musicians.    During these times, the family received many valuable testimonials  touching their musical abilities; but to none of these do they owe so  much as to a highly commendatory letter from the late Rev. Horace  Bushnell of Hartford, Conn. Such testimony from one so eminent, and of  critical abilities so great, could not fail to arrest public attention  in their behalf.    While travelling, the Luca family suffered greatly from the effects of  a cruel caste spirit then so much prevailing,--being often debarred  from hotels, and often denied decent accommodation in public  conveyances. But this barbarous treatment of those whose fine musical  qualities and genteel appearance and deportment--albeit they were of  dark complexions--gave them title to enter the very best places  aroused the sympathy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28057"],[0,"Highways and Byways in Surrey (#18)"],[1,", is hardly so much spotted as hidden by  undistinguished villas and dreary brick. Perhaps it would please Cobbett  as well as it pleased him ninety years ago. Pewley Hill in his day stood  naked to the wind, except for the semaphore and its buildings, and  Cobbett deeply hated the semaphore. To us, who have the telephone and  telegram, there seems nothing hateful in it (unless we hate the  telephone), but to Cobbett the line of semaphore towers between London  and Portsmouth stood for all that was dreadful in war, debt, jobbery and  alarums. He could see nothing attractive in the cleverness and despatch  of a system which enabled news to be sent from London to Portsmouth in a  few seconds. (It took three-quarters of a minute to signal the hour of  one o'clock from Greenwich to Portsmouth and back again to Greenwich).  All he saw was bloody war and money wrongly spent. Thus, of one of the  line:--    \"This building is, it seems, called a _Semaphore_, or _Semiphare_, or  something of that sort. What this word may have been hatched out of I  cannot say; but it means _a job_, I am sure. To call it an _alarm-post_  would not have been so convenient; for, people not endued with Scotch  _intellect_, might have wondered why the d---- we should have to pay for  alarm-posts and might have thought that with all our 'glorious  victories' we had 'brought our hogs to a fine market' if our dread of  the enemy were such as to induce us to have alarm-posts all over the  country!\" The semaphore north of the road from Guildford to Farnham  urges him to even higher flights:--    \"What can this be _for_? Why are these expensive things put up all over  the country? Respecting the movements of _whom_ is wanted this _alarm  system_? Will no member ask this in Parliament? Not one! not a man: and  yet it is a thing to ask about. Ah! it is in vain, THING, that you thus  are _making your preparations_; in vain that you are setting your  trammels! The DEBT, the blessed debt, that best ally of the people, will  break them all; will snap them, as the hornet does the cobweb; and even  these very 'Semaphores' contribute towards the force of that ever  blessed debt.\"    Semaphore House still stands upon Pewley Hill, a modern villa; opposite  it, which would infuriate the old reformer if he could see it, War  Office Ground, marked off with barbed wire and minatory notice-boards. A  hundred years hence, perhaps the fort on Pewley Hill will be exhibited  as one of the curiosities of nineteenth-century Guildford.    Pewley Hill is dull enough in itself to-day, when the down grass has  gone and the bricks are multiplying, but it leads to some of the wildest  and oldest and sweetest of all scenes in the county. You must go over  Pewley Hill to come to the downs, and the downs between Guildford and  Netley, by Newlands Corner, above Albury and Chilworth, are for me, at  all events, the loveliest spot in Surrey. There are other heights in  Surrey with wider views of scenery; there is Hindhead with its almost  complete circle of horizon, from Nettlebed by Henley to the Devil's Dyke  above Brighton; there is the road above Reigate, which looks out over a  thousand roofs and miles of well farmed fields; and there is Leith Hill,  the highest of all hills in south eastern England. But the stretch of  downland running from Guildford to Newlands Corner has a charm that  belongs to none of these. It is not merely the peace and sunshine of the  broad path along the ridge, with its downland flowers and Chalk Hill  Blue butterflies; not only the width and extent of the view over the  Weald, though it is of all views in Surrey one of the loveliest--unlike  the flatter panoramas of Leith Hill and Reigate in that it is a view not  only of fields and meadows, but of tree-clad hills, shouldering into  fainter greens and greys away to Hampshire and Sussex. The enchantment  is something else; the closeness of touch with so much that is dim and  old; the nearness of so much that cannot be reached in changing towns,  on modern roads. For this is unchanged, untouched, unsoiled, part of the  great Way that brought the merchants of Cornwall riding to the Roman  port of Rutupiae in the Isle of Thanet with tin mined in the  Cassiterides. The valley below may have changed from forest to meadow  and plough, but the green road along the ridge remains what it was  before ever it felt a Roman wheel. No fresher air nor clearer sunlight  lies on any Surrey downs than on those broad aisles of shaven turf,  lichened whitethorns and wind-bent yews.    Newlands Corner has seen more than one battle. Mr. St. Loe Strachey,  editor of the _Spectator_, and one of the earliest founders of rifle  clubs in the country, has his home on the downs close by, and Newlands  Corner, the centre of the rifle clubs of Surrey, has been the scene of  assaults and the counter-attacks made by Volunteer cyclists against  defending bands of riflemen. The riflemen have held their own under the  severest fire; Ministers and distinguished soldiers have watched them.    On the downs by Newlands Corner, near the great trackway of the trading  Britons, stand some of the finest yews in England. To one of a group of  trees, a monarch whose descendants count their centuries in a ring about  him, belongs a noble poem. Mr. William Watson, under the shade of its  branches, wrote _The Father of the Forest_. These are the opening  lines:--        Old emperor Yew, fantastic sire,        Girt with thy guard of dotard kings,--      What ages hast thou seen retire        Into the dusk of alien things?      What mighty news hath stormed thy shade,      Of armies perished, realms unmade?        Already wast thou great and wise,        And solemn with exceeding eld,      On that proud morn when England's rays,        Wet with tempestuous joy, beheld      Round her rough coasts the thundering main      Strewn with the ruined dream of Spain.        Hardly thou count'st them long ago,        The warring faiths, the wavering land,      The sanguine sky's delirious glow,        And Cranmer's scorched, uplifted hand.      Wailed not the woods their task of shame,      Doomed to provide the insensate flame?        Mourned not the rumouring winds, when she,        The sweet queen of a tragic hour,      Crowned with her snow-white memory        The crimson legend of the Tower?      Or when a thousand witcheries lay      Felled with one stroke, at Fotheringay?        Ah, thou hast heard the iron tread        And clang of many an armoured age,      And well recall'st the famous dead,        Captains or counsellors brave or sage,      Kings that on kings their myriads hurled,      Ladies whose smile embroiled the world.    The pilgrims' road, as I have tried to show elsewhere, separates from  the Way again at Guildford. The old British track probably kept to the  northern ridge; the pilgrims who visited Guildford may have left by the  same road, but they turned away across the valley to the little chapel  of St. Martha, which stands on a hill two miles south-east of the town.  The pilgrim's track to the chapel, vanished in parts, becomes plain  enough when it crosses the road which now runs from Guildford to  Chilworth west of the chapel by perhaps half a mile. Here it is a wide  smooth path of the finest down grass, cropped close by rabbits, with  which all this breezy hill must be alive by night. Nearly at the top the  path breaks into sand, which must have tested the less elastic of the  travellers to the shrine pretty severely, but the sand breaks again into  an open plateau of as fine grass as the path below. On this plateau  stands the little church, alone in the sun and wind.    [Illustration: _St. Catherine's Chapel, Guildford._]    Sixty years ago St. Martha's was a ruin; as unhappy a little building as  St. Catherine's on the hill beyond the Wey. It was restored in 1848, and  has taken out of the past a quiet and serenity that set it in the old  years, in tranquil sunshine, in the peace of English Sundays. All the  winds blow about it; it is alone in its acre of smooth down grass;  within its churchyard wall are the graves of country labourers and their  children, lowly mounds hardly seen, without the memory of a name, at one  with the purpose of the earth they dug and sowed. Pine trees stand round  the open space of the hill; bluebells in May spread a film under them;  beyond the grasses, heather and ling die from August purples to the  bronze of autumn. The Surrey hills are to the south and west; farthest  on the horizon is the faint blue of the Sussex downs.    There are early Norman walls and arches in the restored chapel. St.  Martha's may be one of the three churches which Domesday assigns to the  manor of Bramley, belonging to Bishop Odo of Bayeux. A less trustworthy  tradition is that Stephen Langton is buried there; the lids of the old  stone coffins found in the chapel when it was restored probably account  for that legend. Martin Tupper accepted the legend as history.    St. Martha's chapel has inspired more than one poet, Tupper among them,  but none have written with more charm on the lonely little building than  Mr. Sidney Allnutt, in a poem which was published in the _Spectator_  last year. Here are six stanzas out of many:--        A little chapel grey with years,      And bleached with sun and rain,      One solid four-square tower it rears      Above strong walls which still oppose      Firm front to elemental foes      That rage at them in vain.        Far southward from St. Martha's Hill,      And to the east and west,      The downs heave up green shoulders, till      The distance with its magic blue      Envelops every other hue,      And crest is lost in crest.        Safe sheltered by the encircling downs      The chequered valleys show      Their tapestry of greens and browns,      Made rich by fields of golden grain,      And threaded by a silver vein      Where Wey's clear waters flow.
