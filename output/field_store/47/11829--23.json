All Wycherley's strokes  are stronger and bolder than those of our misanthrope, but then they are  less delicate, and the rules of decorum are not so well observed in this  play.  The English writer has corrected the only defect that is in  Moliere's comedy, the thinness of the plot, which also is so disposed  that the characters in it do not enough raise our concern.  The English  comedy affects us, and the contrivance of the plot is very ingenious, but  at the same time it is too bold for the French manners.  The fable is  this:--A captain of a man-of-war, who is very brave, open-hearted, and  inflamed with a spirit of contempt for all mankind, has a prudent,  sincere friend, whom he yet is suspicious of; and a mistress that loves  him with the utmost excess of passion.  The captain so far from returning  her love, will not even condescend to look upon her, but confides  entirely in a false friend, who is the most worthless wretch living.  At  the same time he has given his heart to a creature, who is the greatest  coquette and the most perfidious of her sex, and he is so credulous as to  be confident she is a Penelope, and his false friend a Cato.  He embarks  on board his ship in order to go and fight the Dutch, having left all his  money, his jewels, and everything he had in the world to this virtuous  creature, whom at the same time he recommends to the care of his supposed  faithful friend.  Nevertheless the real man of honour, whom he suspects  so unaccountably, goes on board the ship with him, and the mistress, on  whom he would not bestow so much as one glance, disguises herself in the  habit of a page, and is with him the whole voyage, without his once  knowing that she is of a sex different from that she attempts to pass  for, which, by the way, is not over natural.    The captain having blown up his own ship in an engagement, returns to  England abandoned and undone, accompanied by his page and his friend,  without knowing the friendship of the one or the tender passion of the  other.  Immediately he goes to the jewel among women, who he expected had  preserved her fidelity to him and the treasure he had left in her hands.  He meets with her indeed, but married to the honest knave in whom he had  reposed so much confidence, and finds she had acted as treacherously with  regard to the casket he had entrusted her with.  The captain can scarce  think it possible that a woman of virtue and honour can act so vile a  part; but to convince him still more of the reality of it, this very  worthy lady falls in love with the little page, and will force him to her  embraces.  But as it is requisite justice should be done, and that in a  dramatic piece virtue ought to be rewarded and vice punished, it is at  last found that the captain takes his page's place, and lies with his  faithless mistress, cuckolds his treacherous friend, thrusts his sword  through his body, recovers his casket, and marries his page.  You will  observe that this play is also larded with a petulant, litigious old  woman (a relation of the captain), who is the most comical character that  was ever brought upon the stage.    Wycherley has also copied from Moliere another play, of as singular and  bold a cast, which is a kind of _Ecole des Femmes_, or, _School for  Married Women_.    The principal character in this comedy is one Homer, a sly fortune  hunter, and the terror of all the City husbands.  This fellow, in order  to play a surer game, causes a report to be spread, that in his last  illness, the surgeons had found it necessary to have him made a eunuch.  Upon his appearing in this noble character, all the husbands in town  flock to him with their wives, and now poor Homer is only puzzled about  his choice.  However, he gives the preference particularly to a little  female peasant, a very harmless, innocent creature, who enjoys a fine  flush of health, and cuckolds her husband with a simplicity that has  infinitely more merit than the witty malice of the most experienced  ladies.  This play cannot indeed be called the school of good morals, but  it is certainly the school of wit and true humour.    Sir John Vanbrugh has written several comedies, which are more humorous  than those of Mr. Wycherley, but not so ingenious.  Sir John was a man of  pleasure, and likewise a poet and an architect.  The general opinion is,  that he is as sprightly in his writings as he is heavy in his buildings.  It is he who raised the famous Castle of Blenheim, a ponderous and  lasting monument of our unfortunate Battle of Hochstet.  Were the  apartments but as spacious as the walls are thick, this castle would be  commodious enough.  Some wag, in an epitaph he made on Sir John Vanbrugh,  has these lines:--       \"Earth lie light on him, for he     Laid many a heavy load on thee.\"    Sir John having taken a tour into France before the glorious war that  broke out in 1701, was thrown into the Bastille, and detained there for  some time, without being ever able to discover the motive which had  prompted our ministry to indulge him with this mark of their distinction.  He wrote a comedy during his confinement; and a circumstance which  appears to me very extraordinary is, that we don't meet with so much as a  single satirical stroke against the country in which he had been so  injuriously treated.    The late Mr. Congreve raised the glory of comedy to a greater height than  any English writer before or since his time.  He wrote only a few plays,  but they are all excellent in their kind.  The laws of the drama are  strictly observed in them; they abound with characters all which are  shadowed with the utmost delicacy, and we don't meet with so much as one  low or coarse jest.  The language is everywhere that of men of honour,  but their actions are those of knaves--a proof that he was perfectly well  acquainted with human nature, and frequented what we call polite company.  He was infirm and come to the verge of life when I knew him.  Mr.  Congreve had one defect, which was his entertaining too mean an idea of  his first profession (that of a writer), though it was to this he owed  his fame and fortune.  He spoke of his works as of trifles that were  beneath him; and hinted to me, in our first conversation, that I should  visit him upon no other footing than that of a gentleman who led a life  of plainness and simplicity.  I answered, that had he been so unfortunate  as to be a mere gentleman, I should never have come to see him; and I was  very much disgusted at so unseasonable a piece of vanity.    Mr. Congreve's comedies are the most witty and regular, those of Sir John  Vanbrugh most gay and humorous, and those of Mr. Wycherley have the  greatest force and spirit.  It may be proper to observe that these fine  geniuses never spoke disadvantageously of Moliere; and that none but the  contemptible writers among the English have endeavoured to lessen the  character of that great comic poet.  Such Italian musicians as despise  Lully are themselves persons of no character or ability; but a Buononcini  esteems that great artist, and does justice to his merit.    The English have some other good comic writers living, such as Sir  Richard Steele and Mr. Cibber, who is an excellent player, and also Poet  Laureate--a title which, how ridiculous soever it may be thought, is yet  worth a thousand crowns a year (besides some considerable privileges) to  the person who enjoys it.  Our illustrious Corneille had not so much.    To conclude.  Don't desire me to descend to particulars with regard to  these English comedies, which I am so fond of applauding; nor to give you  a single smart saying or humorous stroke from Wycherley or Congreve.  We  don't laugh in rending a translation.  If you have a mind to understand  the English comedy, the only way to do this will be for you to go to  England, to spend three years in London, to make yourself master of the  English tongue, and to frequent the playhouse every night.  I receive but  little pleasure from the perusal of Aristophanes and Plautus, and for  this reason, because I am neither a Greek nor a Roman.  The delicacy of  the humour, the allusion, the _a propos_--all these are lost to a  foreigner.    But it is different with respect to tragedy, this treating only of  exalted passions and heroical follies, which the antiquated errors of  fable or history have made sacred.  OEdipus, Electra, and such-like  characters, may with as much propriety be treated of by the Spaniards,  the English, or us, as by the Greeks.  But true comedy is the speaking  picture of the follies and ridiculous foibles of a nation; so that he  only is able to judge of the painting who is perfectly acquainted with  the people it represents.        LETTER XX.--ON SUCH OF THE NOBILITY AS CULTIVATE THE BELLES LETTRES      There once was a time in France when the polite arts were cultivated by  persons of the highest rank in the state.  The courtiers particularly  were conversant in them, although indolence, a taste for trifles, and a  passion for intrigue, were the divinities of the country.  The Court  methinks at this time seems to have given into a taste quite opposite to  that of polite literature, but perhaps the mode of thinking may be  revived in a little time.  The French are of so flexible a disposition,  may be moulded into such a variety of shapes, that the monarch needs but  command and he is immediately obeyed.  The English generally think, and  learning is had in greater honour among them than in our country--an  advantage that results naturally from the form of their government.  There  are about eight hundred persons in England who have a right to speak in  public, and to support the interest of the kingdom; and near five or six  thousand may in their turns aspire to the same honour.  The whole nation  set themselves up as judges over these, and every man has the liberty of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2447"],[0,"Eminent Victorians (#18)"],[1,"and yet discreet  alacrity. In every juncture he had the right word, or the right silence;  his influence ramified in all directions, from the Pope's audience  chamber to the English Cabinet. 'Il Diavolo del Concilio' his enemies  called him; and he gloried in the name.    The real crux of the position was less ecclesiastical than diplomatic.  The Papal Court, with its huge majority of Italian Bishops, could make  sure enough, when it came to the point, of carrying its wishes through  the Council; what was far more dubious was the attitude of the foreign  Governments--especially those of France and England. The French  Government dreaded a schism among its Catholic subjects; it disliked the  prospect of an extension of the influence of the Pope over the mass of  the population of France; and, since the very existence of the last  remnant of the Pope's Temporal Power depended upon the French army, it  was able to apply considerable pressure upon the Vatican. The interests  of England were less directly involved, but it happened that at this  moment Mr. Gladstone was Prime Minister, and Mr. Gladstone entertained  strong views upon the Infallibility of the Pope. His opinions upon the  subject were in part the outcome of his friendship with Lord Acton, a  historian to whom learning and judgment had not been granted in equal  proportions, and who, after years of incredible and indeed well-nigh  mythical research, had come to the conclusion that the Pope could err.  In this Mr. Gladstone entirely concurred, though he did not share the  rest of his friend's theological opinions; for Lord Acton, while  straining at the gnat of Infallibility, had swallowed the camel of the  Roman Catholic Faith. 'Que diable allait-il faire dans cette galere?'  one cannot help asking, as one watched that laborious and scrupulous  scholar, that lifelong enthusiast for liberty, that almost hysterical  reviler of priesthood and persecution, trailing his learning so  discrepantly along the dusty Roman way. But, there are some who know how  to wear their Rome with a difference; and Lord Acton was one of these.    He was now engaged in fluttering like a moth round the Council and in  writing long letters to Mr. Gladstone, impressing upon him the gravity  of the situation, and urging him to bring his influence to bear. If the  Dogma were carried--he declared, no man who accepted it could remain a  loyal subject and Catholics would everywhere become 'irredeemable  enemies of civil and religious liberty'. In these circumstances, was it  not plainly incumbent upon the English Government, involved as it was  with the powerful Roman Catholic forces in Ireland, to intervene? Mr.  Gladstone allowed himself to become convinced, and Lord Acton began to  hope that his efforts would be successful. But, he had forgotten one  element in the situation; he had reckoned without the Archbishop of  Westminster. The sharp nose of Manning sniffed out the whole intrigue.  Though he despised Lord Acton almost as much as he disliked him--'such  men,' he said, 'are all vanity: they have the inflation of German  professors, and the ruthless talk of undergraduates'--yet he realised  clearly enough the danger of his correspondence with the Prime Minister,  and immediately took steps to counteract it. There was a semi-official  agent of the English Government in Rome, Mr. Odo Russell, and around him  Manning set to work to spin his spider's web of delicate and clinging  diplomacy. Preliminary politenesses were followed by long walks upon the  Pincio, and the gradual interchange of more and more important and  confidential communications. Soon poor Mr. Russell was little better  than a fly buzzing in gossamer. And Manning was careful to see that he  buzzed on the right note. In his dispatches to the Foreign Secretary,  Lord Clarendon, Mr. Russell explained in detail the true nature of the  Council, that it was merely a meeting of a few Roman Catholic prelates  to discuss some internal matters of Church discipline, that it had no  political significance whatever, that the question of Infallibility,  about which there had been so much random talk, was a purely theological  question, and that, whatever decision might be come to on the subject,  the position of Roman Catholics throughout the world would remain  unchanged.    Whether the effect of these affirmations upon Lord Clarendon was as  great as Manning supposed is somewhat doubtful; but it is at any rate  certain that Mr. Gladstone failed to carry the Cabinet with him; and,  when at last a proposal was definitely made that the English Government  should invite the Powers of Europe to intervene at the Vatican, it was  rejected. Manning always believed that this was the direct result of Mr.  Russell's dispatches, which had acted as an antidote to the poison of  Lord Acton's letters, and thus carried the day. If that was so, the  discretion of biographers has not yet entirely lifted the veil from  these proceedings Manning had assuredly performed no small service for  his cause. Yet his modesty would not allow him to assume for himself a  credit which, after all, was due elsewhere; and when he told the story  of those days, he would add, with more than wonted seriousness, 'It was  by the Divine Will that the designs of His enemies were frustrated'.    Meanwhile, in the North Transept of St. Peter's a certain amount of  preliminary business had been carried through. Various miscellaneous  points in Christian doctrine had been satisfactorily determined. Among  others, the following Canons were laid down by the Fathers: 'If anyone  does not accept for sacred and canonical the whole and every part of the  Books of Holy Scripture, or deny that they are divinely inspired, let  him be anathema.' 'If anyone says that miracles cannot be, and  therefore, the accounts of them, even those in Holy Scriptures must be  assigned a place among fables and myths, or that the divine origin of  the Christian religion cannot rightly be proved from them, let him be  anathema.' 'If anyone says that the doctrines of the Church can ever  receive a sense in accordance with the progress of science, other than  that sense which the Church has understood and still understands, let  him be anathema.' 'If anyone says that it is not possible, by the  natural light of human reason, to acquire a certain knowledge of the One  and True God, let him be anathema.' In other words, it became an article  of Faith that Faith was not necessary for a true knowledge of God.  Having disposed of these minor matters, the Fathers found themselves at  last approaching the great question of Infallibility.    Two main issues, it soon appeared, were before them: the. Pope's  infallibility was admitted, ostensibly at least, by all; what remained  to be determined was: (1) whether the definition of the Pope's  Infallibility was opportune, and (2) what the definition of the Pope's  Infallibility was.    (1) It soon became clear that the sense of the Council was  overwhelmingly in favour of a definition. The Inopportunists were a  small minority; they were outvoted, and they were obliged to give way.  It only remained, therefore, to come to a decision upon the second  question--what the definition should actually be.    (2) It now became the object of the Inopportunists to limit the scope of  the definition as much as possible, while the Infallibilists were no  less eager to extend it. Now everyone, or nearly everyone, was ready to  limit the Papal Infallibility to pronouncements ex cathedra--that is to  say, to those made by the Pope in his capacity of Universal Doctor; but  this only served to raise the ulterior, the portentous, and indeed the  really crucial question--to WHICH of the Papal pronouncements ex  cathedra did Infallibility adhere?    The discussions which followed were, naturally enough, numerous,  complicated, and embittered, and in all of them Manning played a  conspicuous part. For two months the Fathers deliberated; through fifty  sessions they sought the guidance of the Holy Ghost. The wooden seats,  covered though they were with Brussels carpet, grew harder and harder;  and still the mitred Councillors sat on. The Pope himself began to grow  impatient; for one thing, he declared, he was being ruined by the mere  expense of lodging and keeping the multitude of his adherents. 'Questi  infallibilisti mi faranno fallire', said his Holiness. At length it  appeared that the Inopportunists were dragging out the proceedings in  the hope of obtaining an indefinite postponement. Then the authorities  began to act; a bishop was shouted down, and the closure was brought  into operation. At this point the French Government, after long  hesitation, finally decided to intervene, and Cardinal Antonelli was  informed that if the Definition was proceeded with, the French troops  would be withdrawn from Rome. But the astute Cardinal judged that he  could safely ignore the threat. He saw that Napoleon III was tottering  to his fall and would never risk an open rupture with the Vatican.  Accordingly, it was determined to bring the proceedings to a close by a  final vote. Already the Inopportunists, seeing that the game was up, had  shaken the dust of Rome from their feet. On July 18th, 1870, the Council  met for the last time. As the first of the Fathers stepped forward to  declare his vote, a storm of thunder and lightning suddenly burst over  St. Peter's. All through the morning the voting continued, and every  vote was accompanied by a flash and a roar from heaven. Both sides, with  equal justice, claimed the portent as a manifestation of the Divine  Opinion. When the votes were examined, it was found that 533 were in  favour of the proposed definition and two against it. Next day, war was  declared between France and Germany, and a few weeks later the French  troops were withdrawn from Rome. Almost in the same moment, the  successor of St. Peter had lost his Temporal"]]]
