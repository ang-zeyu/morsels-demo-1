Bay salt,                        4 oz.    Corrosive sublimate,             4 grs.    Alum,                            2 oz.    Boiling water,                   2 quarts.    Keep in stoppered bottle labelled \"Poison.\"    [Footnote: \"Bay salt\" is salt formed by evaporation of sea-water in  shallow lagoons or \"salt-pans\" exposed to the rays of the sun.]    No. 25.--Goadby's Solution, No. 2.    Bay salt,                  0.5 lb.    Corrosive sublimate,         2 grs.    Arsenious acid,             20 grs.    Boiling rain water,          1 quart.    Keep in stoppered bottle labelled \"Poison.\"    Note that, corrosive sublimate being a remarkably difficult thing to  dissolve, even in pure spirits of wine, it may not be generally known  that the addition of a saturated solution of sal ammoniac, in weight  about half an ounce, is sufficient to dissolve many ounces of  corrosive sublimate. Thus a solution useful for some purposes is  easily made as follows:    No. 26.--Browne's Preservative Solution.    Saltpetre,                          4 oz.    Corrosive sublimate,             0.25 oz.    Alum,                               2 oz.    Sal ammoniac,                   0.125 oz.    Boiling water,                 half gallon.    Keep in stoppered bottle labelled \"Poison.\"    This, it will be seen, is a modification of Goadby's Solution.    In the three preceding formulae the corrosive sublimate must be  dissolved in a small quantity of spirits of some kind, or, as  explained above, by the addition of a strong solution of sal ammoniac.    No. 27.--Saline Solution for bottling Fish and Reptiles.    Bichloride of mercury (corrosive sublimate),      1 grain.    Chloride of sodium (common salt),                90 grains.    Distilled water,                                  1 pint.    Intimately mix, set aside, let settle, and when clear, decant and  preserve in stoppered bottles. The following might also be tried:    No. 28.--Camphorated Fluid for Preserving Fishes, etc.    To distilled water, sixteen parts, add one part of rectified spirits  of wine and a few drops of creosote, sufficient to saturate it; stir  in a small quantity of best prepared chalk, and then filter. With this  fluid mix an equal quantity of camphor water (water saturated with  camphor), and before using, strain off through very fine muslin.    The bisulphite of lime (see formula No. 11, ante) would also, no  doubt, be excellent as a preservative for fishes if not quite so much  diluted. Chloride of zinc, much diluted, is recommended as a good  preservative.    Dr. Priestley Smith's formula (see No. 14, ante) would do exceedingly  well for small specimens to be subsequently arranged in glass-topped  tanks, as at the British Museum.    Another formula, sometimes used in the medical schools for preserving  parts of subjects, and useful as a pickle for fish and reptiles, is a  preparation called Moeller's Solution:    No. 29--Moeller's Solution.    Bichromate of potash,     2 oz.    Sulphate of soda,         1 oz.    Distilled water,          3 pints.    A saturated solution of chromic acid is also used for the same  purposes. The chief disadvantage which both this and Moeller's  Solution possess in common is their colour--a rich golden one--which,  of course, stains everything with which they come in contact. This,  however, is easily removable by the Hydrate of Chloral formula (see  Priestley Smith's formula, No. 14, Section 2, ante).    This last (Moeller's Solution) I have kept purposely until the end, as  it is the formula which, in my opinion, fulfils all the four  requirements stated in the opening paragraph, as desirable in the  preservation of the lower vertebrates. On my appointment to the  curatorship of the Leicester Museum I had occasion to overhaul the  \"pickles\" and prepare some fresh specimens, and was very loth to use  expensive spirits, or even methylated, for large fish, and therefore  tried many things with varying results. At last I was driven back on  Moeller's Solution, and by its aid saved some specimens which were  slowly rotting in other fluids, and successfully \"pickled\" such flabby  things as sharks' eggs, sea anemones, and large-sized \"lump fish.\" It  was then tried on common \"dog-fish,\" one of which came out limp, yet  perfectly tough, and was skinned as an experiment after a month's  immersion.    One day two large \"topers\" (a small species of shark), about six feet  long, were sent from Scarboro'. My taxidermist being very busy at the  time, I decided to give Moeller a severe test and pickle them.  Accordingly--their viscera only being removed--they were tumbled into  a large tub containing 2 lb. of bichromate of potassa to 20 galls. of  spring water. This was on 13th Sept, 1882; I looked at them on 17th  July, 1883, and they were perfectly fresh, quite limp, unshrivelled,  and yet so tough as to be capable of any treatment, even to being cast  as models, or \"set up\" by the taxidermic art; and this after the lapse  of ten calendar months--a time more than sufficient for even a sailing  vessel to come from any part of the world.    I changed the solution once, the total cost from first to last being  one shilling and fourpence. Had pure spirit been used, the expense  would have been many pounds, to say nothing of the great shrivelling  which would have taken place by now. I must therefore think that  Moeller's solution is, for the purpose, one of the best things ever  invented.    PRESERVATIVE FLUIDS FOR MOLLUSCA.    Generally speaking, pure alcohol is the best for this purpose.  Chloride of zinc would doubtless be of considerable service, and I  notice that Woodward, in his \"Manual of the Molluscs,\" says that  chloride of calcium, made by dissolving chalk, or the purer carbonate  --white marble,--in hydro-chloric acid until effervescence ceases and  a saturated solution is obtained, is most useful as a preservative, as  it \"keeps the specimen previously steeped in it permanently moist  without injuring its colour or texture; while its antiseptic  properties will aid in the preservation of matters liable to decay.\"    Possibly some of the beautiful preparations in the Fisheries  Exhibition of 1883 were prepared in this manner, and such objects as  the sea-anemones, with tentacles expanded as in life, may have been  instantaneously killed by osmic acid.    LUTING FOR STOPPERS.    No doubt, every one notices how the ordinary wax, which is used as a  protective coating for bottles or \"preparation\" jars, is attacked by  the contained spirit in such a manner as to be useless as a preventive  of evaporation. Ordinary sealing wax, \"bottle wax,\" beeswax, or  paraffin wax, being useless, we are driven back on a very old recipe  of the French naturalist M. Peron, who claimed for it advantages which  it certainly possesses.    No. 30.--\"Lithocolle\" for Sealing Bottles.    Common resin.    Yellow beeswax (or paraffin wax).    Red ochre (in powder).    Oil of turpentine (turps).    The proportions of this luting are determined by putting more or less  resin and red ochre, or turpentine and wax, as the \"lithocolle\" is to  be more or less brittle or elastic. Melt the wax in the resin, then  add the ochre in small quantities, and at each addition of this stir  the whole briskly round. When the mixture has boiled seven or eight  minutes, pour in the turpentine, stir it round, and set it near the  fire to keep it warm some little time. To ascertain the quality, and  if it requires more or less wax, put a little out on a cold plate, and  note its degree of tenacity.    It is rather dangerous to prepare, and is best managed over a gas jet  or stove, so arranged that the flame does not rise above the edge of  the iron pot containing the composition; if this is attended to, not  much danger can arise, especially if, in case of the composition  firing, the lid of the pot be immediately clapped on.    Apply with an old brush, or by repeatedly plunging the neck of the  bottle in the luting before the latter becomes cold. I have used an  application of glue with great success on corks over spirits, by  procuring the best glue, making it rather thin, and applying it whilst  hot in successive coats. It will not do, however, for non-alcoholic  solutions, nor for glass stoppers, from which it scales off when cold.    GENERAL REMARKS.    In all cases when \"pickling\" animals it must be remembered that the  first pickle, whether alcoholic or not, is essentially deteriorated by  the bloody mucus and water which exudes from the specimens, especially  if large and \"flabby;\" this, of course, reduces the strength of the  preservative medium. It is well, therefore, to have from three to four  different vessels, in which the objects shall be successively immersed  for several days, or even weeks, until, coming to the final  preparation jar, they shall not stain the liquid in which they are  ultimately to rest.    By using the various strengths of each preservative fluid one under  the other, in which to steep the specimens, proper results will be  obtained, by the exercise of a little forethought and judgment.  Filtration through blotting paper or charcoal is necessary from time  to time, and expensive spirits may be re-distilled when becoming too  weak by constant use.    Large fishes must have small cuts made in the walls of the abdomen to  allow the fluid to properly penetrate. In cases where the specimen is  not required for dissection, the removal of the viscera facilitates  the ultimate preservation.    If at 'any time it is necessary to throw away a quantity of  inexpensive spent liquor which may smell offensively, a small quantity  of the crystals of permanganate of potassa will instantly deodorise a  large quantity of fluid, and this without adding to it any offensive  scent of its own, as in the case of chloride"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26030"],[0,"The Automobilist Abroad (#18)"],[1,"an-Pied-de-Port and St. Beat, neither of  the routes much used, and not at all by automobiles.    A typical little mountain town, Mauleon is the _chef-lieu_ of the  Arrondissement, and the ancient capital of the Vicomte de Soule. It  has an excellent hotel, allied to the Touring Club de France (Hotel  Saubidet), where one dines well off the fare of the country with no  imitation Parisian dishes. There is a sort of a historical monument  here, the Chateau de Mauleon (Malo-Leone--Mauvais Lion--Wicked Lion:  the reader may take his choice) of the fifteenth century, which  surrounds itself accommodatingly with a legend which the native will  tell you, if asked.    There is no great accommodation for automobiles at Mauleon, and one  can only buy oil and gasoline by going to a man named Etcheberrigary  for it. His address is not given, but any one will tell you where he  lives. They may not recognize your pronunciation, but they will  recognize your dilemma at once and point the way forthwith.    It was forty-one kilometres to St. Jean-Pied-de-Port, over an  \"all-up-and-down-hill\" road, if there ever was one--up out of one  river valley and down into another all the way until we struck the  road by the banks of the Nive and approached the town.    St. Jean-Pied-de-Port takes its name from its proximity to one of the  Franco-Spanish gateways through the Pyrenees.    It is in danger of becoming a resort, since the guide-books already  announce it as a _station climatique_. Its Basque name of  _Donajouana_, or _Don Ilban-Garici_, ought, however, to stop any  great throng from coming.    It lies directly at the foot of the Col de Roncevalles leading into  Spain (1,057 metres). The pass has ever been celebrated in the annals  of war, from the days of the Paladin Roland to those of Marechal  Soult's attack on the English at Pampelune.    Considering that St. Jean-Pied-de-Port boasts of only fourteen  hundred inhabitants, and is almost hidden in the Pyrenean fastness,  one does very well within its walls. There is a railway to Bayonne,  the post, telegraph, a pharmacy, and a Red Cross station, and the  wants of the automobilist are attended to sufficiently well by the  local locksmith. The Hotel Central, on the Place du Marche, is  vouched for by the Touring Club. It has a _salle des bains_ and other  useful accessories often wanting in more pretentious establishments,  a dark room for camera fiends, a pit for automobiles, and electric  lights. For all this you pay six franc a day. \"_Pas cher!_\"    Bayonne, through the Basque country, is fifty odd kilometres distant,  a gentle descent all the way, down the valley of the Nive.    The Basques are a picturesque and lovable people, and they have kept  their characteristics and customs bright and shining through many  centuries of change round about them.    They love the dance, all kinds of agile games like the _jeu de paume_  and _pelota_, and will dance for three days at a fete with a passion  which does not tire. Even to-day the Basque thinks more of a local  fete than he does of anything else, and will journey fifteen or  twenty kilometres afoot--if he can't get a ride--to form a part of  some religious procession or a _tournee de paume_.    Cambo, midway between St. Jean-Pied-de-Port and Bayonne, is a tiny  spring and bath resort trying hard to be fashionable. There are many  villas near-by of wealthy \"Basques-Americains,\" from the Argentine.    The Basques, at least the Basques-Francais, are a disappearing factor  in the population of Europe. It is said there are more Basques in the  Argentine Republic than in the Republic of France, and all because of  the alienation of the Basques by Louis XIV. when he married  Marie-Therese and her 500,000 ecus of _dot_. Since 1659 the real  Basque, he or she of the fine teeth, has been growing beautifully  less in numbers, both in France and in Spain.    A certain fillip was given to Cambo by the retreat here of Edward  Rostand, the author of \"Cyrano\" and \"L'Aiglon.\" In his wake followed  litterateurs and journalists, and the fame of the hitherto unworldly  little spot--sheltered from all the winds that blow--was bruited  abroad, and the Touring Club de France erected a pavilion; thus all  at once Cambo became a \"resort,\" in all that the name implies.    A _mecanicien_ has not yet come to care for the automobilist in  trouble, but the locksmith _(serrurier)_ will do what he can and  charge you little for it. Gasoline is high-priced, fifty sous a  _bidon_.    Bayonne, with its tradition, its present-day prosperity, and its  altogether charming situation, awaited us twenty odd kilometres away,  and we descended upon its excellent, but badly named, Grand Hotel  just at nightfall. There's another more picturesquely named near by,  and no doubt as excellent, called the Panier-Fleuri. We would much  rather have stopped at the latter,--if only on account of its  name,--but there was no accommodation for the automobile. M.  Landlord, brace up!    Bayonne is a fortress of the first class, and commands the western  gateway into Spain. Its brilliant aspect, its cosmopolitanism, and  its storied past appealed to us more than did the attractions of its  more fastidious neighbour, Biarritz. One can see a better bull-fight  at Bayonne than he can at Biarritz, where his sport must consist  principally of those varieties of gambling games announced by  European hotel-keepers as having \"all the diversions of Monte Carlo.\"  Bull-fighting is forbidden in France, but more or less mysteriously  it comes off now and then. We did not see anything of the sort at  Bayonne, but we had many times at Arles, and Nimes, and knew well  that when the southern Frenchman sets about to provide a gory  spectacle he can give it quite as rosy a hue as his Spanish brother.    Biarritz called us the next day, and, not wishing to be taken for  dukes, or millionaires, or _chauffeurs_ and their friends out on a  holiday, we left the automobile _en garage_, and covered the seven  kilometres by the humble tramway. Be wise, and don't take your  automobile to a resort like Biarritz unless you want to pay.    It's a long way from the Pont Saint-Esprit at Bayonne to the _plage_  at Biarritz, in manners and customs, at any rate, and the seeker  after real local colour will find more of it at Bayonne than he will  at its seaside neighbour, where all is tinged with Paris, St.  Petersburg, and London.    The Empress Eugenie, or perhaps Napoleon III., \"made\" Biarritz when  he built the first villa in the little Basque fishing-village, which  had hitherto known neither courts nor coronets. There's no doubt  about it; Biarritz is a fine resort of its class, as are Monte Carlo  and Ostende. One can study human nature at all three, if that is what  he is out for; so, too, he can--the same sort--on Paris's boulevards.    [Illustration: On the Road in the Pyrenees]    The month of October is time for the gathering of the fashionables  and elegants of all capitals at Biarritz. All the world bathes  together in the warm waters of the Plage des Basques, and the sublime  contrast of the Pyrenees on one hand, and the open sea and sky on the  other, give a panorama of grandeur that few of its competitors have.    The visitors to Biarritz daily augment in numbers, and, since it had  been a sort of neutral trysting-ground for the King and Queen of  Spain before their marriage, and since the seal of his approval has  been given to it by Edward VII. of England (to the great disconcern  of the Riviera hotel-keepers), it bids fair to become even more  popular.    From Bayonne to the Spanish frontier it is thirty kilometres by the  road which runs through the Basque country and through St.  Jean-de-Luz, a delightful little seaside town which has long been a  \"resort\" of the mildly homeopathic kind, and which, let us all hope,  will never degenerate into another Nice, or Cannes, or Menton. The  great event of its historic past was the marriage here of Louis XIV.  with the Infanta Marie-Theres on the sixth of June, 1660, but to-day  everything (in the minds of the inhabitants) dates from the arrival  of the increasing shoals of visitor from \"_brumeuse Angleterre_\" in  the first days of November, with the added hope that this year's  visitors will exceed in numbers those of the last--which they  probably will.    Those who know not St. Jean-de-Luz and its charms had best hurry up  before they entirely disappear. The Automobile Club de France  endorses the Hotel d'Angleterre of St. Jean as to its beds and its  table, and also notes the fact that you may count on spending  anything you like from thirteen francs a day upward for your  accommodation. The Touring Club de France swears by the Hotel  Terminus-Plage (equally unfortunately named), and here you will get  off for ten francs or so per day, and probably be cared for quite as  well as at the other. In any case they both possess a _salle des  bains_ and a shelter for your automobile.    We stopped only for lunch, and found it excellent, at the Hotel de la  Poste, with _vin compris_--which is not the case at the great hotels.  _En passant_, let the writer say that the average \"tourist\" (not the  genuine vagabond traveller) will not drink the _vin de table_, but  prefers the same thing--at a supplementary price--for the pleasure of  seeing the cork drawn before his eyes. The \"_grands hotels_\" of the  resorts recognize this and cater for the tourist accordingly.    We were bound for Fontarabia that night, just over the Spanish  border. The Spanish know it as Feuntarabia, and the Basques as  Ondarriba. For this reason one's pronunciation is likely to be  understood, because no two persons pronounce it exactly alike, and  the natives' comprehensions have been trained in a good school.    Fontarabia is gay, is ancient, and is very _foreign_ to anything in  France, even bordering upon the Spanish frontier. We left the  automobile at Hendaye, not wishing to put"]]]
