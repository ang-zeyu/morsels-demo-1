Two regiments were to remain in charge of the  camp; the rest, unincumbered by baggage, were to march against the  enemy.    Soon after six, the next morning, the English were on the way to Aghrim.  But some delay was occasioned by a thick fog which hung till noon  over the moist valley of the Suck; a further delay was caused by the  necessity of dislodging the Irish from some outposts; and the afternoon  was far advanced when the two armies at length confronted each other  with nothing but the bog and the breastwork between them. The English  and their allies were under twenty thousand; the Irish above twenty-five  thousand.    Ginkell held a short consultation with his principal officers. Should  he attack instantly, or wait till the next morning? Mackay was for  attacking instantly; and his opinion prevailed. At five the battle  began. The English foot, in such order as they could keep on treacherous  and uneven ground, made their way, sinking deep in mud at every step, to  the Irish works. But those works were defended with a resolution such as  extorted some words of ungracious eulogy even from men who entertained  the strongest prejudices against the Celtic race. [107] Again and again  the assailants were driven back. Again and again they returned to the  struggle. Once they were broken, and chased across the morass; but  Talmash rallied them, and forced the pursuers to retire. The fight had  lasted two hours; the evening was closing in; and still the advantage  was on the side of the Irish. Ginkell began to meditate a retreat. The  hopes of Saint Ruth rose high. \"The day is ours, my boys,\" he cried,  waving his hat in the air. \"We will drive them before us to the walls of  Dublin.\" But fortune was already on the turn. Mackay and Ruvigny, with  the English and Huguenot cavalry, had succeeded in passing the bog at  a place where two horsemen could scarcely ride abreast. Saint Ruth at  first laughed when he saw the Blues, in single file, struggling through  the morass under a fire which every moment laid some gallant hat and  feather on the earth. \"What do they mean?\" he asked; and then he  swore that it was pity to see such fine fellows rushing to certain  destruction. \"Let them cross, however;\" he said. \"The more they are,  the more we shall kill.\" But soon he saw them laying hurdles on the  quagmire. A broader and safer path was formed; squadron after squadron  reached firm ground: the flank of the Irish army was speedily turned.  The French general was hastening to the rescue when a cannon ball  carried off his head. Those who were about him thought that it would  be dangerous to make his fate known. His corpse was wrapped in a cloak,  carried from the field, and laid, with all secresy, in the sacred ground  among the ruins of the ancient monastery of Loughrea. Till the fight was  over neither army was aware that he was no more. To conceal his death  from the private soldiers might perhaps have been prudent. To conceal it  from his lieutenants was madness. The crisis of the battle had arrived;  and there was none to give direction. Sarsfield was in command of the  reserve. But he had been strictly enjoined by Saint Ruth not to stir  without orders; and no orders came. Mackay and Ruvigny with their horse  charged the Irish in flank. Talmash and his foot returned to the attack  in front with dogged determination. The breastwork was carried. The  Irish, still fighting, retreated from inclosure to inclosure. But, as  inclosure after inclosure was forced, their efforts became fainter  and fainter. At length they broke and fled. Then followed a horrible  carnage. The conquerors were in a savage mood. For a report had been  spread among them that, during the early part of the battle, some  English captives who had been admitted to quarter had been put to the  sword. Only four hundred prisoners were taken. The number of the slain  was, in proportion to the number engaged, greater than in any other  battle of that age. But for the coming on of a moonless night, made  darker by a misty rain, scarcely a man would have escaped. The obscurity  enabled Sarsfield, with a few squadrons which still remained unbroken,  to cover the retreat. Of the conquerors six hundred were killed, and  about a thousand wounded.    The English slept that night on the field of battle. On the following  day they buried their companions in arms, and then marched westward.  The vanquished were left unburied, a strange and ghastly spectacle. Four  thousand Irish corpses were counted on the field of battle. A hundred  and fifty lay in one small inclosure, a hundred and twenty in another.  But the slaughter had not been confined to the field of battle. One who  was there tells us that, from the top of the hill on which the Celtic  camp had been pitched, he saw the country, to the distance of near four  miles, white with the naked bodies of the slain. The plain looked, he  said, like an immense pasture covered by flocks of sheep. As usual,  different estimates were formed even by eyewitnesses. But it seems  probable that the number of the Irish who fell was not less than seven  thousand. Soon a multitude of dogs came to feast on the carnage. These  beasts became so fierce, and acquired such a taste for human flesh,  that it was long dangerous for men to travel this road otherwise than in  companies. [108]    The beaten army had now lost all the appearance of an army, and  resembled a rabble crowding home from a fair after a faction fight. One  great stream of fugitives ran towards Galway, another towards Limerick.  The roads to both cities were covered with weapons which had been flung  away. Ginkell offered sixpence for every musket. In a short time so many  waggon loads were collected that he reduced the price to twopence; and  still great numbers of muskets came in. [109]    The conquerors marched first against Galway. D'Usson was there, and  had under him seven regiments, thinned by the slaughter of Aghrim and  utterly disorganized and disheartened. The last hope of the garrison  and of the Roman Catholic inhabitants was that Baldearg O'Donnel, the  promised deliverer of their race, would come to the rescue. But Baldearg  O'Donnel was not duped by the superstitious veneration of which he  was the object. While there remained any doubt about the issue of the  conflict between the Englishry and the Irishry, he had stood aloof.  On the day of the battle he had remained at a safe distance with his  tumultuary army; and, as soon as he had learned that his countrymen had  been put to rout, he fled, plundering and burning all the way, to the  mountains of Mayo. Thence he sent to Ginkell offers of submission  and service. Ginkell gladly seized the opportunity of breaking up  a formidable band of marauders, and of turning to good account the  influence which the name of a Celtic dynasty still exercised over the  Celtic race. The negotiation however was not without difficulties. The  wandering adventurer at first demanded nothing less than an earldom.  After some haggling he consented to sell the love of a whole people, and  his pretensions to regal dignity, for a pension of five hundred pounds a  year. Yet the spell which bound his followers to hire was not altogether  broken. Some enthusiasts from Ulster were willing to fight under the  O'Donnel against their own language and their own religion. With a small  body of these devoted adherents, he joined a division of the English  army, and on several occasions did useful service to William. [110]    When it was known that no succour was to be expected from the hero whose  advent had been foretold by so many seers, the Irish who were shut up in  Galway lost all heart. D'Usson had returned a stout answer to the  first summons of the besiegers; but he soon saw that resistance was  impossible, and made haste to capitulate. The garrison was suffered  to retire to Limerick with the honours of war. A full amnesty for past  offences was granted to the citizens; and it was stipulated that, within  the walls, the Roman Catholic priests should be allowed to perform  in private the rites of their religion. On these terms the gates were  thrown open. Ginkell was received with profound respect by the Mayor and  Aldermen, and was complimented in a set speech by the Recorder. D'Usson,  with about two thousand three hundred men, marched unmolested to  Limerick. [111]    At Limerick, the last asylum of the vanquished race, the authority of  Tyrconnel was supreme. There was now no general who could pretend that  his commission made him independent of the Lord Lieutenant; nor was the  Lord Lieutenant now so unpopular as he had been a fortnight earlier.  Since the battle there had been a reflux of public feeling. No part of  that great disaster could be imputed to the Viceroy. His opinion indeed  had been against trying the chances of a pitched field, and he could  with some plausibility assert that the neglect of his counsels had  caused the ruin of Ireland. [112]    He made some preparations for defending Limerick, repaired the  fortifications, and sent out parties to bring in provisions. The  country, many miles round, was swept bare by these detachments, and  a considerable quantity of cattle and fodder was collected within the  walls. There was also a large stock of biscuit imported from France.  The infantry assembled at Limerick were about fifteen thousand men.  The Irish horse and dragoons, three or four thousand in number, were  encamped on the Clare side of the Shannon. The communication between  their camp and the city was maintained by means of a bridge called the  Thomond Bridge, which was protected by a fort. These means of defence  were not contemptible. But the fall of Athlone and the slaughter of  Aghrim had broken the spirit of the army. A small party, at the head of  which were Sarsfield and a brave Scotch officer named Wauchop, cherished  a hope that the triumphant progress"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26196"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 3, February, 1851 (#18)"],[1,"of the  discovery.\" Congress has never made any decision or award at all in the  premises. A committee was hastily appointed, and it presented a report,  probably prepared in Boston. The friends of Dr. Wells were not advised  of any such attempt, and it was thought this report, with agreeing  resolutions, could be smuggled through the House. But a counter report  was immediately offered, nevertheless, and so the game stopped.    We cannot, in these pages, enter into any detail of the history of this  important discovery; but those who wish to investigate it, are referred  to a pamphlet lately issued at Hartford, entitled, \"_Discovery by the  late Dr. Horace Wells of the Applicability of Nitrous Oxide Gas,  Sulphuric Ether, and other Vapors, in Surgical Operations, nearly two  years before the Patented Discovery of Drs. Charles T. Jackson and W. T.  G. Morton_.\" This pamphlet was prepared by Mr. Toucey, recently Attorney  General of the United States, and nothing can be more conclusive and  satisfactory, to a fair inquirer, than the evidence contained in it,  that Drs. Jackson and Morton had never even the slightest thought of any  thing like etherization, until Dr. Wells, some time after the discovery,  proceeded to Boston, in the hope that Dr. Morton (who was under especial  private obligations to him, and therefore was regarded by him as a  friend) would assist him in procuring for it larger publicity and  recognition. Poor Wells was only laughed at by these gentlemen, who, two  years afterward, claimed the discovery as their own!    How complete the discovery, and how successful the application of it,  will appear from the affidavit of Dr. Marcy. Mr. Toucey says:         \"Dr. E. E. Marcy, formerly of Hartford, now of the city of       New-York, was present at the rooms of Dr. Wells, by his       special request, to witness the operation upon Mr. F. C.       Goodrich, and witnessed it with the strong sensations       produced by a new and wonderful discovery upon a scientific       observer. He says, not only was the extraction accomplished       without pain, but the inhalation of the gas was effected       without any of those indications of excitement, or attempts       at muscular exertion, which do commonly obtain when the gas       is administered _without a definite object or previous       mental preparation_. 'By this experiment,' says Dr. Marcy,       'two important, and, to myself, _entirely new facts_ were       demonstrated: 1st. That the body could be rendered       insensible to pain by the inhalation of a gas or vapor,       capable of producing certain effects upon the organism. And       2d. When such agents were administered, to a sufficient       extent, for a definite object, and with a suitable       impression being previously produced upon the mind, that no       unusual mental excitement, or attempts at physical effort       would follow the inhalation.         \"'Witnessing these wonderful phenomena, these new and       astounding facts, the idea at once occurred to me whether       there were not other substances analogous in effect to the       gas, and which might be employed with more convenience and       with equal efficacy and safety. Knowing that the inhalation       of sulphuric-ether vapor gave rise to precisely the same       effects as those of the gas, from numerous former trials       with both these substances, I suggested to Dr. Wells, the       employment of the vapor of rectified sulphuric ether--at the       same time detailing to him its ordinary effects upon the       economy, and the method of preparing the articles for use.       Our first impression was, that it possessed all the       anaesthetic properties of the nitrous oxyd, was equally safe,       and could be prepared with less trouble, thus affording an       article which was not expensive, and could always be kept at       hand. At the same time, I told Dr. Wells that I would       prepare some ether, and furnish him some of it to       administer, and also make a trial of it myself, in a       surgical case which I expected to operate upon in a few       days. Not long after this conversation (to which allusion is       made by Mr. Goodrich, in his affidavit) I administered the       vapor of rectified sulphuric ether, in my office, to the       young man above alluded to, and after he had been rendered       insensible to pain, cut from his head an encysted tumor of       about the size of an English walnut. The operation was       entirely unattended with pain, and demonstrated to Dr. Wells       and myself, in the most conclusive manner, the anaesthetic       properties of ether vapor.'         \"We have narrated this important experiment in the language       of Dr. Marcy, to whose affidavit we take leave to refer, as       no part of it can, with any propriety or justice, be       overlooked by any one who proposes to subject this matter to       a searching examination. It shows the progress and the       successful result of these inquiries and experiments of Dr.       Wells, and of those skilful and liberal professional       gentlemen who co-operated with him. It shows that the       opinion was then entertained by Dr. Marcy, that the       constituents of the gas were more nearly allied to the       atmospheric air than were those of ether vapor--that the       former was more agreeable and easy to inhale than the       latter, and upon the whole was more safe and equally       efficacious as an anaesthetic agent--and that this opinion       was fully confirmed by numerous experiments subsequently       made by Drs. Ellsworth, Beresford, Riggs, Terry, Wells and       himself. It shows further, that _Dr. Wells visited Boston in       1844, for the purpose of communicating his discovery to the       faculty of that city, and that, on his return, he informed       Dr. Marcy that he had communicated it to Dr. C. T. Jackson,       and to Dr. Morton, and received from the former, and from       other medical gentlemen of Boston, nothing but ridicule for       his pains_.\"    We have no room for testimony. Mr. Toucey concludes his statement in the  following manner:--         \"More than a year and a half after Dr. Wells had personally       made known to Dr. Jackson, and to Dr. Morton, his former       pupil, the result of his experiments, more than one year       after the announcement in the Boston _Medical and Surgical       Journal_, published at their doors, we find Dr. Jackson and       Dr. Morton confederating together, taking out a patent for       this principle, and attempting ineffectually to appropriate       it to their joint pecuniary benefit! Dr. Jackson as the       philosopher, Dr. Morton as the operator! And shortly       afterwards, differing in almost every thing else, agreeing       nevertheless in one thing--each affirming of the other that       he was not entitled to the merit of the discovery!         \"Such is a brief statement of the proof, by which the mere       matter of fact is established, which induced the Legislature       of Connecticut to hail the late Dr. Horace Wells as a public       benefactor. With this accumulation of evidence on one side,       bearing directly upon the point, and _nothing to countervail       it on the other_, it is impossible to resist the conclusion       that he was the fortunate author of this great discovery,       unless one or the other of two propositions can be       established, namely, either that such a paralysis of the       nervous system as would render the subject insensible to       pain during the process of extracting teeth, would not       embrace the principle of it, or on the other hand, that       nitrous oxyd gas is arbitrarily to be excluded from its       proper place in a class of agents, all of which are nearly       identical in their operation. And even if this difficult       task could be accomplished, there would still remain another       equally difficult to be encountered; because it has already       been shown that Dr. Wells went beyond these limits, and that       Dr. Marcy, in conjunction with him, subjected the use of       sulphuric ether in a larger surgical operation, to the test       of successful experiment. But either of the foregoing       propositions would be too absurd to require a moment's       consideration. The principle is as fully developed by the       painless extraction of teeth, as by the painless amputation       of a limb; by the successful use of nitrous oxyd gas, as of       rectified sulphuric ether. In the language of Dr. Marcy:       'The man who first discovered the fact that the inhalation       of a gaseous substance would render the body insensible to       pain under surgical operations, should be entitled to all       the credit or emolument which may accrue from the use of any       substances of this nature. This is the _principle_--this is       the _fact_--this is the _discovery_. The mere substitution       of ether vapor or any other article for the gas, no more       entitles one to the claim of a _discovery_, than the       substitution of coal for wood in generating steam, would       entitle one to be called the discoverer of the powers of       steam.'         \"It is unnecessary to pursue the subject further. It would       be one of the greatest marvels of this wonderful age, if the       world, with these facts before it, did not confirm the       decision which it has already pronounced, and award to Dr.       Wells the merit of a discovery, which will be remembered and       appreciated as long as mankind shall be exposed to       suffering, or have occasion to apply an antidote.\"    The section upon etherization, we presume, will serve as a specimen of  Dr. Davis's _History_ of the First Half of the Eighteenth Century.
