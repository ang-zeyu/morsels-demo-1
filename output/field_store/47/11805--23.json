[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23624"],[0,"Ride Proud, Rebel! (#18)"],[1,".    Was the army pulling out? Drew tried to think coherently. He had  something to do. It was important! Not here--where? The boom of the  field artillery, the flickering of those fires, they confused him,  making it difficult to sort out his memories.    Again, a canteen appeared before him, but now he pushed it petulantly  aside. He didn't want a drink; he wanted to think--to recall what it was  he had to do.    \"Drew--!\" There was a figure, outlined in part by one of those fires,  squatting beside him. \"Can you ride?\"    Ride? Where? Why? He had a mule, didn't he? Back in the horse lines.  Boyd--he had left the mule with Boyd. Boyd! _Now_ he knew what had to be  done!    He moved away from the outstretched hand of the man beside him, got to  his feet, saw the blot of a mount the other was holding. And he caught  at reins, dragged them from the other's hand before he could resist.    \"Boyd!\" He didn't know whether he called that name aloud, or whether it  was one with the beat in his head. Boyd was out on that littered field,  and Drew was going to bring him in.    Towing the half-seen animal by the reins, Drew started for the fires and  the boom of the guns.    \"All right!\" The words came to him hollowly. \"But not that way, you're  loco! This way! The Yankees are burnin' up what's left of the town; that  ain't the battlefield!\"    Drew was ready to resist, but now his own eyes confirmed that. Fire was  raging among the few remaining buildings of the ghost town, and shells  were striking at targets pinned in that light, shells from Confederate  batteries, taking sullen return payment for that disastrous July day.    A lantern bobbed by his side, swinging to the tread of the man carrying  it. And, as they turned away from the inferno which was consuming  Harrisburg, Drew saw other such lights in the night, threading along the  slope. This was the heartbreaking search, among the dead, for the  living, who might yet be brought back to the agony of the field  hospitals. He was not the only one hunting through the human wreckage  tonight.    \"I've talked to Johnson,\" Kirby said. \"It'll be like huntin' for a steer  in the big brush, but we can only try.\"    They could only try ... Drew thought he was hardened to sights, sounds.  He had helped bring wounded away from other fields, but somehow this was  different. Yet, oddly enough, the thought that Boyd could be--_must_  be--lying somewhere on that slope stiffened Drew, quickened his muscles  back into obedience, kept him going at a steady pace as he led Hannibal  carefully through the tangle of the dead. Twice they found and freed the  still living, saw them carried away by search parties. And they were  working their way closer to the breastworks.    \"Ho--there--Johnny!\"    The call came out of the dark, out of the wall hiding the Yankee forces.    Drew straightened from a sickening closer look at three who had fallen  together.    \"Johnny!\" The call was louder, rising over the din from the burning  town. \"One, one of yours--he's been callin' out some ... to your left  now.\"    Kirby held up the lantern. The circle of light spread, catching on a  spurred boot. That tiny glint of metal moved, or was it the booted foot  which had twitched?    Drew strode forward as Kirby swung the lantern in a wider arc. The man  on the ground lay on his back, his hands moving feebly to tear at the  already rent shirt across his chest. There was a congealed mass of blood  on one leg just above the boot top. Drew knew that flushed and swollen  face in spite of its distortion; they had found what they had been  searching for.    Kirby pulled those frantic hands away from the strips of calico, the  scratched flesh beneath, but there was no wound there. The leg injury  Drew learned by quick examination was not too bad a one. And they could  discover no other hurt; only the delirium, the flushed face, and the  fast breathing suggested worse trouble.    \"Sun, maybe.\" Kirby transferred his hold to the rolling head, vising it  still between his hands while Drew dripped a scanty stream of the  unpalatable water from the Texan's canteen onto Boyd's crusted, gaping  lips.    \"I'll mount Hannibal. You hold him!\" Drew said. \"He can't stay in the  saddle by himself.\"    Somehow they managed. Boyd's head, still rolling back and forth, moved  now against Drew's sound shoulder. Kirby steadied his trailing legs,  then went ahead with the lantern. Before they moved off, Drew turned his  head to the breastworks.    \"Thanks, Yankee!\" He called as loudly and clearly as his thirst-dried  throat allowed. There was no answer from the hidden picket or sentry--if  he were still there. Then Hannibal paced down the slope.    \"The Calhoun place?\" Kirby asked.    Hannibal stumbled, and Boyd cried out, the cry becoming a moan.    \"Yes. Anse ...\" Drew added dully, \"do you know ... this was his  birthday--today. I just remembered.\"    Sixteen today.... Maybe somewhere he could find the surgeon to whom last  night he had turned over the drugs in his saddlebags. The doctor's  gratitude had been incredulous then. But that was before the battle,  before a red tide of broken men had flowed into the dressing station at  the Calhoun house. The leg wound was not too bad, but the sun had  affected the boy who had lain in its full glare most of the day. He must  have help.    The saddlebags of drugs, Boyd needing help--one should balance the  other. Those facts seesawed back and forth in Drew's aching head, and he  held his muttering burden close as Kirby found them a path away from the  rending guns and the blaze of the fires.          9    _One More River To Cross_      \"The weather is sure agin this heah war. A man's either frizzled clean  outta his saddle by the heat--or else his hoss's belly's deep in the mud  an' he gits him a gully-washer down the back of his neck! Me--I'm a West  Texas boy, an' down theah we have lizard-fryin' days an' twisters that  are regular hell winds, and northers that'll freeze you solid in one  little puff-off. But then all us boys was raised on rattlesnakes,  wildcats, an' cactus juice--we're kinda hardened to such. Only I ain't  seen as how this half of the country is much better. Maybe we shouldn't  have switched our range--\"    Drew grinned at Kirby's stream of whispered comment and complaint as  they wriggled their way forward through brush to look down on a Union  blockhouse and stockade guarding a railroad trestle.    \"Weather don't favor either side. The Yankees have it just as bad, don't  they?\"    The Texan made a snake's noiseless progress to come even with his  companion's vantage point.    \"Sure, but then they should ... they ought to pay up somehow for huntin'  their hosses on somebody else's range. We'd be right peaceable was they  to throw their hoofs outta heah. My, my, lookit them millin' round down  theah. Jus' like a bunch of ants, ain't they? Had us one of Cap'n  Morton's bull pups now, we could throw us a few shells as would make that  nest boil right over into the gully!\"    \"We'll do something when the General gets here,\" Drew promised.    Kirby nodded. \"Yes, an' this heah General Forrest, too. He sure can  ramrod a top outfit. Jus' prances round the country so that the poor  little blue bellies don't know when he's goin' to pop outta some bush,  makin' war talk at 'em. You know, the kid's gonna be hoppin' to think he  missed this heah show--\"    \"At least we know where he is and what he's doin'.\"    Kirby propped his chin on his forearm. \"Jus' 'bout now he's sittin' down  at the table back theah in Meridian with a sight of fancy grub lookin'  back at him. How long you think he's gonna take to bein' corraled that  way?\"    \"General Buford gave him strict orders personally--\"    \"Nice to have a general take an interest in you,\" Kirby commented. \"You  Kaintuck boys, you're scattered all through this heah army. Want to stay  with Boyd 'cause he's ailin', so you jus' find you a general from your  home state an' talk yourself into a transfer--\"    \"Notice you wanted me to talk you into one, too.\"    \"Well, Missouri, Mississippi, an' Tennessee are a sight nearer Texas an'  home than Virginia. Anyway, theah warn't much left of our old outfit,  an' this heah Forrest is headin' up a sassy bunch. So I'm glad you did  find you a general to sling some weight an' git us into his scouts jus'  'cause he knew your grandpappy. Kaintucks stick together....\"    There was a second of silence through which they could both hear the  faint sounds of life from the stockade.    \"M' father was a Texan,\" Drew said suddenly.    \"Now that's a right interestin' observation,\" Kirby remarked. \"Heah I  was all the time thinkin' you was one of these heah fast-ridin',  fine-livin' gentlemen what was givin' some tone to the army. Not jus'  'nother range drifter from the big spaces. What part of Texas you  from--Brazos?\"    \"Oh, I wasn't born there. You had a war down that way, remember?\"    \"You mean when Santa Anna came trottin' in with his tail high, thinkin'  as how he could talk harsh to some of us Tejanos?\"    \"No, later than that--when some of us went down to talk harsh in  Mexico.\"    \"Sure. Only I don't recollect that theah powder-burnin' contest, m'self.  M'pa went ... got him these heah fancy hoss ticklers theah.\" Kirby moved  his hand toward the spurs he had taken off and tucked into his shirt for  safekeeping to muffle the jingle while they were on scout. \"Took 'em  away from a Mex officer, personal. Me, I was too young to draw fightin'  wages in that theah dust-up.\"    \"My father wasn't too young, and he drew his wages permanent. My  grandfather went down to Texas and brought my mother back to Kentucky  just in time for me to appear. My grandfather didn't like Texans.\"    \"An' maybe not your father, special?\"    Drew smiled, this time mirthlessly. \"Just so. You see, m' father came up  from Texas to get his schoolin' in Kentucky. He was studyin' to be a  doctor at Lexington.
