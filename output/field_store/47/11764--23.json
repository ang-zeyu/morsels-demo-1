This is the moon, and so it is always the  moon's day, or Monday, and Monday it shall be with you always. Whenever  any one looks up at the moon, he will say, 'See the man with the sticks  on his back. He was taken to the moon because he gathered wood on  Sunday.'\"    \"Oh dear, oh dear,\" cried the goodman, \"what will the goodwife say?\"          THE TWIN STARS.      In front of the little house was a pine-tree, and every night at the  time when the children went to bed, a bright star appeared over the top  of the tree and looked in at the window. The children were brother and  sister. They were twins, and so they always had each other to play with.    \"Now go to sleep,\" the mother would say when she had kissed them  good-night, but it was hard to go to sleep when such a beautiful,  radiant thing was shining in at the window of the little house.    \"What do you suppose is in the star?\" asked the sister.    \"I think there are daisies and honey and violets and butterflies and  bluebirds,\" answered the brother.    \"And I think there are roses and robins and berries and humming-birds,\"  said the sister.    \"There must be trees and grass too, and I am sure there are pearls and  diamonds.\"    \"I can almost see them now,\" declared the sister. \"I wish we could  really see them. To-morrow let us go and find the star.\"    When morning came, the star was gone, but they said, \"It was just behind  the pine-tree, and so it must be on the blue mountain.\" The blue  mountain was a long way off, but it looked near, and the twins thought  they could walk to it in an hour. All day long they walked. They went  through the lonely woods, they crossed brooks, they climbed hills, and  still they could not find the radiant star that had looked in at their  window. The hour had come when their mother always put them to bed and  kissed them and said good-night, but now they had no mother, no  good-night kiss, and no bed. They were tired and sleepy. They heard  strange sounds in the forest, and they were frightened. \"I am so tired,\"  the sister whispered. \"I am afraid a bear will come. I wish we could see  the star.\"    The sky had grown dark, and a star could be seen here and there, but it  was not their star. They went on till they could go no farther. \"We will  lie down on the grass,\" said the brother, \"and cover ourselves up with  leaves, and go to sleep.\"    Tired as they were, they did not have time to go to sleep before they  heard a bear calling \"Ugh! Ugh!\" in the woods. They sprang up and ran  out of the woods, and just before they came to the bottom of the hill,  they saw right in front of them a beautiful little lake. They were not  frightened any more, for there in the water was something radiant and  shining. \"It is our own star,\" said they, \"and it has come down to us.\"  They never thought of looking up into the sky over their heads. It was  enough for them that the star was in the water and so near them. But was  it calling them? They thought so. \"Come,\" cried the brother, \"take my  hand, and we will go to the star.\" Then the spirit of the skies lifted  them up gently and carried them away on a beautiful cloud.    The father and mother sat alone in the little house one evening, looking  sadly out of the window through which the twins had looked. \"There is  the star that they loved,\" the mother said. \"I have often listened to  them while they talked of it. It is rising over the pine-tree in front  of the house.\" They sat and watched the star. It was brighter and more  radiant than ever, and in it the father and mother saw the faces of  their lost children. \"Oh, take us too, good spirit of the skies!\" they  cried. The spirit heard them, and when the next evening came, close  beside the star there was another star. In that were the father and  mother, and at last they and the children were all very happy to be  together again.          THE LANTERN AND THE FAN.      In a Japanese village there once lived a man who had two sons. When the  sons were grown up, each brought home a wife from another village a long  distance away. The father was greatly pleased with his two  daughters-in-law, and for many months they all lived very happily  together.    At last the two young wives asked to go home to visit their friends.  Among the Japanese the sons and the sons' wives must always obey the  father, so the two wives said, \"Father-in-law, it is a long, long time  since we have seen our friends. May we go to our old home and visit  them?\" The father-in-law answered, \"No.\" After many months they asked  again, and again he answered, \"No.\" Once more they asked. The  father-in-law thought, \"They care nothing for me, or they would not wish  to leave me, but I have a plan, and I can soon know whether they love  their father-in-law or not.\" Then he said to the older of the two wives,  \"You may go if you wish, but you must never come back unless you bring  me fire wrapped in paper.\" To the younger he said, \"You may go if you  wish, but you must never come back unless you bring me wind wrapped in  paper.\" The father-in-law thought, \"Now I shall find out. If they care  for me, they will search the country through till they find paper that  will hold fire and wind.\"    The two young wives were so glad to visit their old friends that for  almost a month they forgot all about the gifts that they were to carry  to their father-in-law. At last, when it was time to go home, they were  greatly troubled about what they must carry with them, and they asked a  wise man where to find the strange things. \"Paper that will hold fire  and wind!\" he cried. \"There is no such paper in Japan.\" The two women  asked one wise man after another, and every one declared, \"There is no  such paper in Japan.\" What should they do? They feared they would never  see their home again. They were so sad that they left their friends and  wandered a long distance into the forest. Great tears fell from their  eyes.    \"I do not let people cry in my woods,\" said a voice. \"My trees do not  grow well in salt water.\"    The poor wives were so sorrowful that they forgot to be afraid, and the  older one said, \"Can we help crying? Unless I can carry to my  father-in-law fire wrapped in paper, I can never go home.\" \"And I,\"  wailed the younger, \"unless I can carry wind wrapped in paper, I can  never go home. None of the wise men ever heard of such things. What  shall we do?\"    \"It is easy enough to wrap fire in paper,\" answered the voice. \"Here is  a piece of paper. Now watch.\" They watched, and the strangest thing in  all the world happened right before their eyes. There was no one to be  seen, but a piece of paper appeared on the ground and folded itself into  a Japanese lantern. \"Now put a candle inside,\" said the voice, \"and you  have paper holding fire. What more could you ask?\"    Then the older woman was happy, but the younger was still sad. She saw  now that fire could be carried in paper, but surely no one could carry  wind. \"O dear voice,\" she cried, \"can any one carry wind in paper?\"    \"That is much easier than to carry fire,\" replied the voice, \"for wind  does not burn holes. Watch.\"    They watched eagerly. Another piece of paper came all by itself and lay  on the ground between them. There was a picture on it of a tree covered  with white blossoms. Two women stood under the tree, gathering the  blossoms.    \"The two women are yourselves,\" said the voice, \"and the blossoms are  the gifts that the father-in-law will give you when you go home.\"    \"But I cannot go home,\" the younger wailed, \"for I cannot carry wind  wrapped in paper.\"    \"Here is the paper, and there is always plenty of wind. Why not take  them?\"    \"Indeed, I do not know how,\" the younger woman answered sorrowfully.    \"This way, of course,\" said the voice. Some long, light twigs flew to  the paper. It folded itself, over, under, together. It opened and  closed, and it waved itself before the tearful face of the younger  woman. \"Does not the wind come to your face?\" asked the voice, \"and is  it not the fan that has brought it? The lantern carries fire wrapped in  paper, and the fan carries wind wrapped in paper.\"    Then, indeed, the two young women were happy, and when they came to the  home of their father-in-law, he was as glad as they. He gave them  beautiful gifts of gold and silver, and he said, \"No one ever had such  marvels before as the lantern and the fan, but in my home there are two  more precious things than these, and they are my two dear daughters.\"          VOCABULARY OF THE BOOK OF NATURE MYTHS.

The case is the same with all structural variations of animal parts,  which are not absolutely insignificant. When the insects acquired  wings they must also have acquired the mechanism with which to move  them--the musculature, and the nervous apparatus necessary for its  automatic regulation. All instincts depend upon compound reflex  mechanisms and are just as indispensable as the parts they have to set  in motion, and all may have arisen through processes of selection if  the reasons which I have elsewhere given for this view are  correct.[54]    Thus there is no lack of adaptations within the organism, and  particularly in its most important and complicated parts, so that we  may say that there is no actively functional organ that has not  undergone a process of adaptation relative to its function and the  requirements of the organism. Not only is every gland structurally  adapted, down to the very minutest histological details, to its  function, but the function is equally minutely adapted to the needs of  the body. Every cell in the mucous lining of the intestine is exactly  regulated in its relation to the different nutritive substances, and  behaves in quite a different way towards the fats, and towards  nitrogenous substances, or peptones.    I have elsewhere called attention to the many adaptations of the whale  to the surrounding medium, and have pointed out--what has long been  known, but is not universally admitted, even now--that in it a great  number of important organs have been transformed in adaptation to the  peculiar conditions of aquatic life, although the ancestors of the  whale must have lived, like other hair-covered mammals, on land. I  cited a number of these transformations--the fish-like form of the  body, the hairlessness of the skin, the transformation of the  fore-limbs to fins, the disappearance of the hind-limbs and the  development of a tail fin, the layer of blubber under the skin, which  affords the protection from cold necessary to a warm-blooded animal,  the disappearance of the ear-muscles and the auditory passages, the  displacement of the external nares to the forehead for the greater  security of the breathing-hole during the brief appearance at the  surface, and certain remarkable changes in the respiratory and  circulatory organs which enable the animal to remain for a long time  under water. I might have added many more, for the list of adaptations  in the whale to aquatic life is by no means exhausted; they are found  in the histological structure and in the minutest combinations in the  nervous system. For it is obvious that a tail-fin must be used in  quite a different way from a tail, which serves as a fly-brush in  hoofed animals, or as an aid to springing in the kangaroo or as a  climbing organ; it will require quite different reflex-mechanisms and  nerve combinations in the motor centres.    I used this example in order to show how unnecessary it is to assume a  special internal evolutionary power for the phylogenesis of species,  for this whole order of whales is, so to speak, _made up of  adaptations_; it deviates in many essential respects from the usual  mammalian type, and all the deviations are adaptations to aquatic  life. But if precisely the most essential features of the organisation  thus depend upon adaptation, what is left for a phyletic force to do,  since it is these essential features of the structure it would have to  determine? There are few people now who believe in a phyletic  evolutionary power, which is not made up of the forces known to  us--adaptation and heredity--but the conviction that _every_ part of  an organism depends upon adaptation has not yet gained a firm footing.  Nevertheless, I must continue to regard this conception as the correct  one, as I have long done.    I may be permitted one more example. The feather of a bird is a  marvellous structure, and no one will deny that as a whole it depends  upon adaptation. But what part of it _does not_ depend upon  adaptation? The hollow quill, the shaft with its hard, thin, light  cortex, and the spongy substance within it, its square section  compared with the round section of the quill, the flat barbs, their  short, hooked barbules which, in the flight-feathers, hook into one  another with just sufficient firmness to resist the pressure of the  air at each wing-beat, the lightness and firmness of the whole  apparatus, the elasticity of the vane, and so on. And yet all this  belongs to an organ which is only passively functional, and therefore  can have nothing to do with the _Lamarckian principle_. Nor can the  feather have arisen through some magical effect of temperature,  moisture, electricity, or specific nutrition, and thus selection is  again our only anchor of safety.    But--it will be objected--the substance of which the feather consists,  this peculiar kind of horny substance, did not first arise through  selection in the course of the evolution of the birds, for it formed  the covering of the scales of their reptilian ancestors. It is quite  true that a similar substance covered the scales of the Reptiles, but  why should it not have arisen among them through selection? Or in what  other way could it have arisen, since scales are also passively useful  parts? It is true that if we are only to call adaptation what has been  acquired by the species we happen to be considering, there would  remain a great deal that could not be referred to selection; but we  are postulating an evolution which has stretched back through aeons,  and in the course of which innumerable adaptations took place, which  had not merely ephemeral persistence in a genus, a family or a class,  but which was continued into whole Phyla of animals, with continual  fresh adaptations to the special conditions of each species, family,  or class, yet with persistence of the fundamental elements. Thus the  feather, once acquired, persisted in all birds, and the vertebral  column, once gained by adaptation in the lowest forms, has persisted  in all the Vertebrates from Amphioxus upwards, although with constant  readaptation to the conditions of each particular group. Thus  everything we can see in animals is adaptation, whether of to-day, or  of yesterday, or of ages long gone by; every kind of cell, whether  glandular, muscular, nervous, epidermic, or skeletal, is adapted to  absolutely definite and specific functions, and every organ which is  composed of these different kinds of cells contains them in the proper  proportions, and in the particular arrangement which best serves the  function of the organ; it is thus adapted to its function.    All parts of the organism are tuned to one another, that is, _they are  adapted to one another_, and in the same way _the organism as a whole  is adapted to the conditions of its life, and it is so at every stage  of its evolution._    But all adaptations _can_ be referred to selection; the only point  that remains doubtful is whether they all _must_ be referred to it.    However that may be, whether the _Lamarckian principle_ is a factor  that has cooeperated with selection in evolution, or whether it is  altogether fallacious, the fact remains, that selection is the cause  of a great part of the phyletic evolution of organisms on our earth.  Those who agree with me in rejecting the _Lamarckian principle_ will  regard selection as the only _guiding_ factor in evolution, which  creates what is new out of the transmissible variations, by ordering  and arranging these, selecting them in relation to their number and  size, as the architect does his building-stones so that a particular  style must result.[55] But the building-stones themselves, the  variations, have their basis in the influences which cause variation  in those vital units which are handed on from one generation to  another, whether, taken together they form the _whole_ organism, as in  Bacteria and other low forms of life, or only a germ-substance, as in  unicellular and multicellular organisms.
