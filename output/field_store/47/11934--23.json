Under these complex influences the Maryland Assembly passed in 1649 an  Act concerning Religion. It reveals, upon the one hand, Christendom's  mercilessness toward the freethinker--in which mercilessness, whether  through conviction or policy, Baltimore acquiesced--and, on the other  hand, that aspiration toward friendship within the Christian fold which  is even yet hardly more than a pious wish, and which in the seventeenth  century could have been felt by very few. To Baltimore and the Assembly  of Maryland belongs, not the glory of inaugurating an era of wide  toleration for men and women of all beliefs or disbeliefs, whether  Christian or not, but the real though lesser glory of establishing  entire toleration among the divisions within the Christian circle  itself. According to the Act,*    \"Whatsoever person or persons within this Province and the Islands  thereunto belonging, shall from henceforth blaspheme God, that is curse  him, or deny our Saviour Jesus Christ to bee the sonne of God, or  shall deny the holy Trinity,... or the Godhead of any of the said three  persons of the Trinity, or the unity of the Godhead, or shall use or  utter any reproachful speeches, words or language concerning the  said Holy Trinity, or any of the said three persons thereof, shall be  punished with death and confiscation or forfeiture of all his or her  lands and goods to the Lord Proprietary and his heires.... Whatsoever  person or persons shall from henceforth use or utter any reproachfull  words, or speeches, concerning the blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother of  our Saviour, or the holy Apostles or Evangelists, or any of them, shall  in such case for the first offence forfeit to the said Lord Proprietary  and his heires the sum of five pound sterling.... Whatsoever person  shall henceforth upon any occasion... declare, call, or denominate any  person or persons whatsoever inhabiting, residing, traffiqueing, trading  or comerceing within this Province, or within any of the Ports, Harbors,  Creeks or Havens to the same belonging, an heritick, Scismatick,  Idolator, puritan, Independant, Presbiterian, popish priest, Jesuite,  Jesuited papist, Lutheran, Calvenist, Anabaptist, Brownist, Antinomian,  Barrowist, Roundhead, Separtist, or any other name or term in a  reproachful manner relating to matter of Religion, shall for every such  Offence forfeit... the sum of tenne shillings sterling....    \"Whereas the inforceing of the conscience in matters of Religion  hath frequently fallen out to be of dangerous Consequence in those  commonwealths where it hath been practised,... be it therefore also  by the Lord Proprietary with the advice and consent of this Assembly,  ordeyned and enacted... that no person or persons whatsoever within this  Province...professing to beleive in Jesus Christ, shall from henceforth  bee any waies troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect  of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof... nor anyway  compelled to the beleif or exercise of any other Religion against his or  her consent, soe as they be not unfaithfull to the Lord Proprietary or  molest or conspire against the civill Government...\"         * \"Archives of Maryland, Proceedings and Acts of the General       Assembly\", vol. I, pp. 244-247.        CHAPTER XI. COMMONWEALTH AND RESTORATION    On the 30th of January, 1649, before the palace of Whitehall, Charles  the First of England was beheaded. In Virginia the event fell with a  shock. Even those within the colony who were Cromwell's men rather than  Charles's men seem to have recoiled from this act. Presently, too, came  fleeing royalists from overseas, to add their passionate voices to those  of the royalists in Virginia. Many came, \"nobility, clergy and gentry,  men of the first rate.\" A thousand are said to have arrived in the year  after the King's death.    In October the Virginia Assembly met. Parliament men--and now these were  walking with head in the air--might regret the execution of the past  January, and yet be prepared to assert that with the fall of the kingdom  fell all powers and offices named and decreed by the hapless monarch.  What was a passionate royalist government doing in Virginia now that  England was a Commonwealth? The passionate government answered for  itself in acts passed by this Assembly. With swelling words, with a  tragic accent, it denounced the late happenings in England and all the  Roundhead wickedness that led up to them. It proclaimed loyalty to \"his  sacred Majesty that now is\"--that is, to Charles Stuart, afterwards  Charles the Second, then a refugee on the Continent. Finally it enacted  that any who defended the late proceedings, or in the least affected to  question \"the undoubted and inherent right of his Majesty that now is to  the Collony of Virginia\" should be held guilty of high treason; and  that \"reporters and divulgers\" of rumors tending to change of government  should be punished \"even to severity.\"    Berkeley's words may be detected in these acts of the Assembly. In no  great time the Cavalier Governor conferred with Colonel Henry Norwood,  one of the royalist refugees to Virginia. Norwood thereupon sailed away  upon a Dutch ship and came to Holland, where he found \"his Majesty  that now is.\" Here he knelt, and invited that same Majesty to visit his  dominion of Virginia, and, if he liked it, there to rest, sovereign of  the Virginian people. But Charles still hoped to be sovereign in England  and would not cross the seas. He sent, however, to Sir William Berkeley  a renewal of his Governor's commission, and appointed Norwood Treasurer  of Virginia, and said, doubtless, many gay and pleasant things.    In Virginia there continued to appear from England adherents of the  ancient regime. Men, women, and children came until to a considerable  degree the tone of society rang Cavalier. This immigration, now lighter,  now heavier, continued through a rather prolonged period. There came now  to Virginia families whose names are often met in the later history  of the land. Now Washingtons appear, with Randolphs, Carys, Skipwiths,  Brodnaxes, Tylers, Masons, Madisons, Monroes, and many more. These  persons are not without means; they bring with them servants; they are  in high favor with Governor and Council; they acquire large tracts  of virgin land; they bring in indentured labor; they purchase African  slaves; they cultivate tobacco. From being English country gentlemen  they turn easily to become Virginia planters.    But the Virginia Assembly had thrown a gauntlet before the victorious  Commonwealth; and the Long Parliament now declared the colony to be  in contumacy, assembled and dispatched ships against her, and laid an  embargo upon trade with the rebellious daughter. In January of 1652  English ships appeared off Point Comfort. Four Commissioners of the  Commonwealth were aboard, of whom that strong man Claiborne was one.  After issuing a proclamation to quiet the fears of the people,  the Commissioners made their way to Jamestown. Here was found the  indomitable Berkeley and his Council in a state of active preparation,  cannon trained. But, when all was said, the Commissioners had brought  wisely moderate terms: submit because submit they must, acknowledge the  Commonwealth, and, that done, rest unmolested! If resistance continued,  there were enough Parliament men in Virginia to make an army. Indentured  servants and slaves should receive freedom in exchange for support to  the Commonwealth. The ships would come up from Point Comfort, and a  determined war would be on. What Sir William Berkeley personally said  has not survived. But after consultation upon consultation Virginia  surrendered to the commonwealth.    Berkeley stepped from the Governor's chair, retiring in wrath and  bitterness of heart to his house at Greenspring. In his place sat  Richard Bennett, one of the Commissioners. Claiborne was made Secretary.  King's men went out of office; Parliament men came in. But there was  no persecution. In the bland and wide Virginia air minds failed to come  into hard and frequent collision. For all the ferocities of the statute  books, acute suffering for difference of opinion, whether political or  religious, did not bulk large in the life of early Virginia.    The Commissioners, after the reduction of Virginia, had a like part to  play with Maryland. At St. Mary's, as at Jamestown, they demanded and at  length received submission to the Commonwealth. There was here the less  trouble owing to Baltimore's foresight in appointing to the office  of Governor William Stone, whose opinions, political and religious,  accorded with those of revolutionary England. Yet the Governor could  not bring himself to forget his oath to Lord Baltimore and agree to the  demand of the Commissioners that he should administer the Government  in the name of \"the Keepers of the Liberties of England.\" After some  hesitation the Commissioners decided to respect his scruples and allow  him to govern in the name of the Lord Proprietary, as he had solemnly  promised.    In Virginia and in Maryland the Commonwealth and the Lord Protector  stand where stood the Kingdom and the King. Many are far better  satisfied than they were before; and the confirmed royalist consumes his  grumbling in his own circle. The old, exhausting quarrel seems laid  to rest. But within this wider peace breaks out suddenly an interior  strife. Virginia would, if she could, have back all her old northward  territory. In 1652 Bennett's Government goes so far as to petition  Parliament to unseat the Catholic Proprietary of Maryland and make whole  again the ancient Virginia. The hand of Claiborne, that remarkable and  persistent man, may be seen in this.    In Maryland, Puritans and Independents were settled chiefly about  the rivers Severn and Patuxent and in a village called Providence,  afterwards Annapolis."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2900"],[0,"The Age of Invention: A Chronicle of Mechanical Conquest (#18)"],[1,"iographer*, \"he wrought through  the year 1836, probably the darkest and longest year of his life, giving  lessons to pupils in the art of painting while his mind was in the  throes of the great invention.\" In that year he took into his confidence  one of his colleagues in the University, Leonard D. Gale, who assisted  him greatly, in improving the apparatus, while the inventor himself  formulated the rudiments of the telegraphic alphabet, or Morse Code, as  it is known today. At length all was ready for a test and the message  flashed from transmitter to receiver. The telegraph was born, though  only an infant as yet. \"Yes, that room of the University was the  birthplace of the Recording Telegraph,\" said Morse years later. On  September 2, 1837, a successful experiment was made with seventeen  hundred feet of copper wire coiled around the room, in the presence of  Alfred Vail, a student, whose family owned the Speedwell Iron Works,  at Morristown, New Jersey, and who at once took an interest in the  invention and persuaded his father, Judge Stephen Vail, to advance money  for experiments. Morse filed a petition for a patent in October and  admitted his colleague Gale; as well as Alfred Vail, to partnership.  Experiments followed at the Vail shops, all the partners working day and  night in their enthusiasm. The apparatus was then brought to New York  and gentlemen of the city were invited to the University to see it work  before it left for Washington. The visitors were requested to write  dispatches, and the words were sent round a three-mile coil of wire and  read at the other end of the room by one who had no prior knowledge of  the message.         * Prime, p. 311.      In February, 1838, Morse set out for Washington with his apparatus, and  stopped at Philadelphia on the invitation of the Franklin Institute to  give a demonstration to a committee of that body. Arrived at Washington,  he presented to Congress a petition, asking for an appropriation  to enable him to build an experimental line. The question of the  appropriation was referred to the Committee on Commerce, who reported  favorably, and Morse then returned to New York to prepare to go abroad,  as it was necessary for his rights that his invention should be patented  in European countries before publication in the United States.    Morse sailed in May, 1838, and returned to New York by the steamship  Great Western in April, 1839. His journey had not been very successful.  He had found London in the excitement of the ceremonies of the  coronation of Queen Victoria, and the British Attorney-General had  refused him a patent on the ground that American newspapers had  published his invention, making it public property. In France he  had done better. But the most interesting result of the journey was  something not related to the telegraph at all. In Paris he had met  Daguerre, the celebrated Frenchman who had discovered a process of  making pictures by sunlight, and Daguerre had given Morse the secret.  This led to the first pictures taken by sunlight in the United States  and to the first photographs of the human face taken anywhere. Daguerre  had never attempted to photograph living objects and did not think it  could be done, as rigidity of position was required for a long exposure.  Morse, however, and his associate, John W. Draper, were very soon taking  portraits successfully.    Meanwhile the affairs of the telegraph at Washington had not prospered.  Congress had done nothing towards the grant which Morse had requested,  notwithstanding the favorable report of its committee, and Morse was in  desperate straits for money even to live on. He appealed to the Vails  to assist him further, but they could not, since the panic of 1837 had  impaired their resources. He earned small sums from his daguerreotypes  and his teaching.    By December, 1842, Morse was in funds again; sufficiently, at least, to  enable him to go to Washington for another appeal to Congress. And at  last, on February 23, 1843, a bill appropriating thirty thousand dollars  to lay the wires between Washington and Baltimore passed the House by a  majority of six. Trembling with anxiety, Morse sat in the gallery of the  House while the vote was taken and listened to the irreverent badinage  of Congressmen as they discussed his bill. One member proposed an  amendment to set aside half the amount for experiments in mesmerism,  another suggested that the Millerites should have a part of the money,  and so on; however, they passed the bill. And that night Morse wrote:  \"The long agony is over.\"    But the agony was not over. The bill had yet to pass the Senate. The  last day of the expiring session of Congress arrived, March 3, 1843, and  the Senate had not reached the bill. Says Morse's biographer:    In the gallery of the Senate Professor Morse had sat all the last day  and evening of the session. At midnight the session would close. Assured  by his friends that there was no possibility of the bill being reached,  he left the Capitol and retired to his room at the hotel, dispirited,  and well-nigh broken-hearted. As he came down to breakfast the next  morning, a young lady entered, and, coming toward him with a smile,  exclaimed:    \"I have come to congratulate you!\"    \"For what, my dear friend?\" asked the professor, of the young lady, who  was Miss Annie G. Ellsworth, daughter of his friend the Commissioner of  Patents.    \"On the passage of your bill.\"    The professor assured her it was not possible, as he remained in the  Senate-Chamber until nearly midnight, and it was not reached. She then  informed him that her father was present until the close, and, in the  last moments of the session, the bill was passed without debate or  revision. Professor Morse was overcome by the intelligence, so joyful  and unexpected, and gave at the moment to his young friend, the bearer  of these good tidings, the promise that she should send the first  message over the first line of telegraph that was opened.*         *Prime, p. 465.      Morse and his partners* then proceeded to the construction of the  forty-mile line of wire between Baltimore and Washington. At this point  Ezra Cornell, afterwards a famous builder of telegraphs and founder  of Cornell University, first appears in history as a young man of  thirty-six. Cornell invented a machine to lay pipe underground  to contain the wires and he was employed to carry out the work of  construction. The work was commenced at Baltimore and was continued  until experiment proved that the underground method would not do, and it  was decided to string the wires on poles. Much time had been lost, but  once the system of poles was adopted the work progressed rapidly, and  by May, 1844, the line was completed. On the twenty-fourth of that month  Morse sat before his instrument in the room of the Supreme Court at  Washington. His friend Miss Ellsworth handed him the message which she  had chosen: \"WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT!\" Morse flashed it to Vail forty  miles away in Baltimore, and Vail instantly flashed back the same  momentous words, \"WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT!\"         * The property in the invention was divided into sixteen       shares (the partnership having been formed in 1838) of which       Morse held 9, Francis O. J. Smith 4, Alfred Vail 2, Leonard       D. Gale 2. In patents to be obtained in foreign countries,       Morse was to hold 8 shares, Smith 5, Vail 2, Gale 1. Smith       had been a member of Congress and Chairman of the Committee       on Commerce. He was admitted to the partnership in       consideration of his assisting Morse to arouse the interest       of European Governments.      Two days later the Democratic National Convention met in Baltimore to  nominate a President and Vice-President. The leaders of the Convention  desired to nominate Senator Silas Wright of New York, who was then in  Washington, as running mate to James K. Polk, but they must know first  whether Wright would consent to run as Vice-President. So they posted a  messenger off to Washington but were persuaded at the same time to allow  the new telegraph to try what it could do. The telegraph carried the  offer to Wright and carried back to the Convention Wright's refusal  of the honor. The delegates, however, would not believe the telegraph,  until their own messenger, returning the next day, confirmed its  message.    For a time the telegraph attracted little attention. But Cornell  stretched the lines across the country, connecting city with city, and  Morse and Vail improved the details of the mechanism and perfected the  code. Others came after them and added further improvements. And it is  gratifying to know that both Morse and Vail, as well as Cornell, lived  to reap some return for their labor. Morse lived to see his telegraph  span the continent, and link the New World with the Old, and died in  1872 full of honors.      Prompt communication of the written or spoken message is a demand even  more insistent than prompt transportation of men and goods. By 1859 both  the railroad and the telegraph had reached the old town of St. Joseph on  the Missouri. Two thousand miles beyond, on the other side of plains  and mountains and great rivers, lay prosperous California. The only  transportation to California was by stage-coach, a sixty days' journey,  or else across Panama, or else round the Horn, a choice of three evils.  But to establish quicker communication, even though transportation might  lag, the men of St. Joseph organized the Pony Express, to cover the  great wild distance by riders on horseback, in ten or twelve days. Relay  stations for the horses and men were set up at appropriate points  all along the way, and a postboy dashed off from St. Joseph every  twenty-four hours, on arrival of the train from the East. And for a time  the Pony Express did its work and did it well. President Lincoln's First  Inaugural was carried to California by the"]]]
