Making the Rennet.    In making the rennet, different customs also prevail. In some districts,  a bit of the dried stomach is put into half a pint of lukewarm water,  with as much salt as will lie upon a shilling, is allowed to stand over  night, and in the morning the infusion is poured into the milk. For a  cheese of 60 lbs. weight, a piece of the size of a dollar will often be  sufficient, though of some skins as much as 10 square inches are  required to produce the same effect. It is, however, more common to take  the entire stomach, and to pour upon them from one to three quarts of  water for each stomach, and to allow them to infuse for several days. If  only one has been infused, and the rennet is intended for immediate use,  the infusion requires only to be skimmed and strained. But if several be  infused, or as many as have been provided for the whole season, about  two quarts of water are taken for each, and, after standing not more  than two days, the infusion is poured off, and is completely saturated  with salt. During the summer it is constantly skimmed, and fresh salt  added from time to time. Or a strong brine may at once be poured upon  the skins, and the infusion, when the skins are taken out, may be kept  for a length of time. Some even recommend, that the liquid rennet should  not be used until it is at least two months old. When thus kept,  however, it is indispensable that the water should be fully saturated  with salt.    In Ayrshire, and in some other countries, it is customary to cut the  dried stomach into small pieces, and to put it, with a handful or two of  salt and one or two quarts of water, into a jar, to allow it to stand  for two or three days, afterwards to pour upon it another pint for a  couple of days, to mix the two decoctions, and when strained, to bottle  the whole for future use. In this state it may be kept for many months.    In making rennet, some use pure water only, others prefer clear whey,  others a decoction of leaves, such as those of the sweetbrier, the  dog-rose, and the bramble, or of aromatic herbs and flowers; while  others again, put in lemons, cloves, mace, or brandy. These various  practices are adopted for the purpose of making the rennet keep better,  of lessening its unpleasant smell, of preventing any unpleasant taste it  might give to the curd, or finally of directly improving the flavor of  the cheese. The acidity of the lemon will, no doubt, increase also the  coagulating power of any rennet to which it may be added.    The rennet thus prepared is poured into the milk previously raised to  the temperature of 90 deg. or 95 deg. F., and is intimately mixed with it. The  quantity which it is necessary to add varies with the quality of the  rennet, from a tablespoonful to half a pint for 30 or 40 gallons of  milk. The time necessary for the complete fixing of the curd varies also  from 15 minutes to an hour or even an hour and a half. The chief causes  of this variation, are the temperature of the milk, and the quality and  quantity of the rennet employed.      Different Qualities of Cheese.    The temperature of new or entire milk, when the rennet is added, should  be raised to about 95 deg. F.; that of skimmed milk need not be quite so  high. If the milk be warmer the curd is hard and tough, if colder, it is  soft and difficult to obtain free from the whey. When the former happens  to be the case, a portion of the first whey that separates may be taken  out into another vessel, allowed to cool, and then poured in again. If  it prove to have been too cold, hot milk or water may be added to it; or  a vessel containing hot water may be put into it before the curdling  commences; or the first portion of whey that separates may be heated and  poured again upon the curd. The quality of the cheese, however, will  always be more or less affected, when it happens to be necessary to  adopt any of these remedies. To make the best cheese, the true  temperature should always be attained as nearly as possible, before the  rennet is added.      Mode in which the Milk is warmed.    If, as is the case in some dairies, the milk be warmed in an iron pot  upon the naked fire, great care must be taken that it is not singed or  _fire-fanged_. A very slight inattention may cause this to be the case,  and the taste of the cheese is sure to be more or less affected by it.  In Cheshire, the milk is put into a large tin pail, which is plunged  into a boiler of hot water, and frequently stirred till it is raised to  the proper temperature. In large dairy establishments, however, the  safest method is to have a pot with a double bottom, consisting of one  pot within another, after the manner of a glue-pot; the space between  the two being filled with water. The fire applied beneath, thus acts  only upon the water, and can never, by any ordinary neglect, do injury  to the milk. It is desirable in this heating, not to raise the  temperature higher than is necessary, as a great heat is apt to give an  oiliness to the fatty matter of the milk.      The time during which the Curd stands.    This is also of importance. It should be broken up as soon as the milk  is fully coagulated. The longer it stands after this, the harder and  tougher it will become.      The quality of the Rennet.    This is of much importance, not only in regard to the certainty of the  coagulation, but also to the flavor of the cheese. In some parts of  Cheshire, it is usual to take a piece of the dried membrane and steep it  overnight with a little salt for the ensuing morning's milk. It is thus  sure to be fresh and sweet, if the dried _maw_ be in good preservation.  But where it is customary to steep several skins at a time, and to  bottle the rennet for after-use, it is very necessary to saturate the  solution completely with salt, and to season it with spices, in order  that it may be preserved in a sweet and wholesome state.      The quantity of Rennet added.    This ought to be regulated as carefully as the temperature of the milk.  Too much renders the curd tough; too little causes the loss of much  time, and may permit a larger portion of the butter to separate itself  from the curd. It is to be expected also, that when rennet is used in  great excess, a portion of it will remain in the curd, and will  naturally affect the kind and rapidity of the changes it afterwards  undergoes. Thus, it is said to cause the cheese to heave or swell out  from fermentation. It is probable, also, that it will affect the flavor  which the cheese acquires by keeping. Thus it may be, that the agreeable  or unpleasant taste of the cheeses of certain districts or dairies may  be less due to the quality of the pastures or of the milk itself, than  to the quantity of rennet with which it has there been customary to  coagulate the milk.      The way in which the Rennet is made.    This, no less than its state of preservation and the quantity employed,  may also influence the flavor or other qualities of the cheese. For  instance, in the manufacture of a celebrated French cheese, that of  Epoisse, the rennet is prepared as follows:--Four fresh calf-skins, with  the curd they contain, are well washed in water, chopped into small  pieces, and digested in a mixture of 5 quarts of brandy with 15 of  water, adding at the same time 21/2 lbs. of salt, half an ounce of black  pepper, and a quarter of an ounce each of cloves and fennel seeds. At  the end of six weeks, the liquor is filtered and preserved in  well-corked bottles, while the membrane is put into salt-water to form a  new portion of rennet. For making rich cheeses, the rennet should always  be filtered clear.    On Mont d'Or, the rennet is made with white wine and vinegar. An ounce  of common salt is dissolved in a mixture of half a pint of vinegar with  21/2 pints of white wine, and in this solution a prepared goat's stomach  or _a piece of dried pig's bladder_ is steeped for a length of time. A  single spoonful of this rennet is said to be sufficient for 45 or 50  quarts of milk. No doubt the acid of the vinegar and of the wine aid the  coagulating power derived from the membrane.      The way in which the Curd is treated.    It is usual in our best cheese districts, carefully and slowly to  separate the curd from the whey, not to hasten the separation, lest a  larger portion of the fatty matter should be squeezed out of the curd,  and the cheese should thus be rendered poorer than usual. But in some  places, the practice prevails of washing the curd with hot water, after  the whey has been partially separated from it. Thus at Gouda in Holland,  after the greater part of the whey has been gradually removed, a  quantity of hot water is added, and allowed to remain upon it for at  least a quarter of an hour. The heat makes the cheese more solid and  causes it to keep better.    In Italy, the pear-shaped _caccio-cavallo_ cheeses and the round  _palloni_ cheeses of Gravina, in the Neapolitan territory, are made from  curd, which after being scalded with boiling whey, is cut into slices,  kneaded in boiling water, worked with the hand till it is perfectly  tenacious and elastic, and then made into shapes. The water in which the  curd is washed, after standing twenty-four hours, throws up much oily  matter, which is skimmed off and made into butter.      The Separation of the Whey    Is a part of the process, upon which the quality of the cheese in a  considerable degree depends. In Cheshire, more time and attention is  devoted to the perfect extraction of the whey than in almost any other  district. Indeed, when it is considered that the whey contains sugar and  lactic acid, which may undergo decomposition, and a quantity of rennet  which may bring on fermentation, by both of which processes the flavor  of the cheeses must be considerably affected, it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3421"],[0,"Bramble-Bees and Others (#18)"],[1,"hat, when  the job is finished, it becomes absolutely impossible to distinguish the  entrance-door corresponding with each cell.    The cell is an oval cavity dug in the earthy mass. The wall has the  same polish, the same chalky whiteness as the general passage. But the  Anthophora does not limit herself to digging oval niches: to make her  work more solid, she pours over the walls of the chamber a salivary  liquid which not only whitens and varnishes but also penetrates to a  depth of some millimetres into the sandy earth, which it turns into  a hard cement. A similar precaution is taken with the passage; and  therefore the whole is a solid piece of work capable of remaining in  excellent condition for years.    Moreover, thanks to the wall hardened by the salivary fluid, the  structure can be removed from its matrix by chipping it carefully away.  We thus obtain, at least in fragments, a serpentine tube from which  hangs a single or double row of oval nodules that look like large grapes  drawn out lengthwise. Each of these nodules is a cell, the entrance to  which, carefully hidden, opens into the tube or passage. When she wishes  to leave her cell, in the spring, the Anthophora destroys the mortar  disk that closes the jar and thus reaches the general corridor, which  is quite open to the outer air. The abandoned nest provides a series of  pear-shaped cavities, of which the distended part is the old cell and  the contracted part the exit-neck, rid of its stopper.    These pear-shaped hollows form splendid lodgings, impregnable  strongholds, in which the Osmiae find a safe and commodious retreat for  their families. The Horned Osmia and the Three-horned Osmia establish  themselves there at the same time. Although it is a little too large for  her, Latrielle's Osmia also appears very well satisfied with it.    I have examined some forty of the superb cells utilized by each of the  first two. The great majority are divided into two storeys by means of  a transversal partition. The lower storey includes the larger portion  of the Anthophora's cell; the upper storey includes the rest of the  cell and a little of the bottle-neck that surmounts it. The two-roomed  dwelling is closed, in the passage, by a shapeless, bulky mass of dried  mud. What a clumsy artist the Osmia is, compared with the Anthophora!  Against the exquisite work of the Anthophora, partition and plug strike  a note as hideously incongruous as a lump of dirt on polished marble.    The two apartments thus obtained are of a very unequal capacity, which  at once strikes the observer. I measured them with my five-millimetre  tube. On an average, the bottom one is represented by a column of sand  50 millimetres deep (1.95 inches.--Translator's Note.) and the top one  by a column of 15 millimetres (.585 inch.--Translator's Note.). The  holding-capacity of the one is therefore about three times as large as  that of the other. The cocoons enclosed present the same disparity. The  bottom one is big, the top one small. Lastly, the lower one belongs to a  female Osmia and the upper to a male Osmia.    Occasionally the length of the bottle-neck allows of a fresh arrangement  and the cavity is divided into three storeys. The bottom one, which is  always the most spacious, contains a female; the two above, both smaller  than the first and one smaller than the other, contain males.    Let us keep to the first case, which is always the most frequent. The  Osmia is in the presence of one of these pear-shaped hollows. It is a  find that must be employed to the best advantage: a prize of this sort  is rare and falls only to fortune's favourites. To lodge two females  in it at once is impossible; there is not sufficient room. To lodge two  males in it would be undue generosity to a sex that is entitled to but  the smallest consideration. Besides, the two sexes must be represented  in almost equal numbers. The Osmia decides upon one female, whose  portion shall be the better room, the lower one, which is larger,  better-protected and more nicely polished, and one male, whose portion  shall be the upper storey, a cramped attic, uneven and rugged in the  part which encroaches on the bottle-neck. This decision is proved by  numerous undeniable facts. Both Osmiae therefore can choose the sex  of the egg about to be laid, seeing that they are now breaking up the  laying into groups of two, a female and a male, as required by the  conditions of the lodging.    I have only once found Latreille's Osmia established in the nest of the  Masked Anthophora. She had occupied but a small number of cells, because  the others were not free, being inhabited by the Anthophora. The cells  in question were divided into three storeys by partitions of green  mortar; the lower storey was occupied by a female, the two others by  males, with smaller cocoons.    I came to an even more remarkable example. Two Anthidia of my district,  A. septemdentatum, LATR., and A. bellicosum, LEP., adopt as the home of  their offspring the empty shells of different snails: Helix aspersa, H.  algira, H. nemoralis, H. caespitum. The first-named, the Common Snail,  is the most often used, under the stone-heaps and in the crevices of old  walls. Both Anthidia colonize only the second whorl of the spiral. The  central part is too small and remains unoccupied. Even so with the front  whorl, the largest, which is left completely empty, so much so that, on  looking through the opening, it is impossible to tell whether the shell  does or does not contain the Bee's nest. We have to break this last  whorl if we would perceive the curious nest tucked away in the spiral.    We then find first a transversal partition, formed of tiny bits of  gravel cemented by a putty made from resin, which is collected in fresh  drops from the oxycedrus and the Aleppo pine. Beyond this is a stout  barricade made up of rubbish of all kinds: bits of gravel, scraps of  earth, juniper-needles, the catkins of the conifers, small shells,  dried excretions of Snails. Next come a partition of pure resin, a large  cocoon in a roomy chamber, a second partition of pure resin and, lastly,  a smaller cocoon in a narrow chamber. The inequality of the two cells is  the necessary consequence of the shape of the shell, whose inner space  gains rapidly in width as the spiral gets nearer to the orifice. Thus,  by the mere general arrangement of the home and without any work on the  Bee's part beyond some slender partitions, a large room is marked out in  front and a much smaller room at the back.    By a very remarkable exception, which I have mentioned casually  elsewhere, the males of the genus Anthidium are generally larger than  the females; and this is the case with the two species in particular  that divide the Snail's spiral with resin partitions. I collected some  dozens of nests of both species. In at least half the cases, the two  sexes were present together; the female, the smaller, occupied the front  cell and the male, the bigger, the back cell. Other cells, which were  smaller or too much obstructed at the back by the dried-up remains of  the Mollusc, contained only one cell, occupied at one time by a female  and at another by a male. A few, lastly, had both cells inhabited now by  two males and now by two females. The most frequent arrangement was the  simultaneous presence of both sexes, with the female in front and the  male behind. The Anthidia who make resin-dough and live in Snail-shells  can therefore alternate the sexes regularly to meet the exigencies of  the spiral dwelling-house.    One more thing and I have done. My apparatus of reeds, fixed against the  walls of the garden, supplied me with a remarkable nest of the Horned  Osmia. The nest is established in a bit of reed 11 millimetres wide  inside. (.429 inch--Translator's Note.) It comprises thirteen cells and  occupies only half the cylinder, although the orifice is plugged with  the usual stopper. The laying therefore seems here to be complete.    Well, this laying is arranged in a most singular fashion. There is  first, at a suitable distance from the bottom or the node of the reed, a  transversal partition, perpendicular to the axis of the tube. This marks  off a cell of unusual size, in which a female is lodged. After that,  in view of the excessive width of the tunnel, which is too great for  a series in single file, the Osmia appears to alter her mind. She  therefore builds a partition perpendicular to the transversal partition  which she has just constructed and thus divides the second storey into  two rooms, a larger room, in which she lodges a female, and a smaller,  in which she lodges a male. She next builds a second transversal  partition and a second longitudinal partition perpendicular to it. These  once more give two unequal chambers, stocked likewise, the large one  with a female, the smaller one with a male.    From this third storey onwards, the Osmia abandons geometrical  accuracy; the architect seems to be a little out in her reckoning. The  transversal partitions become more and more slanting and the work  grows irregular, but always with a sprinkling of large chambers for the  females and small chambers for the males. Three females and two males  are housed in this way, the sexes alternating.    By the time that the base of the eleventh cell is reached, the  transversal partition is once more almost perpendicular to the axis.  Here what happened at the bottom is repeated. There is no longitudinal  partition; and the spacious cell, covering the whole diameter of the  cylinder, receives a female. The edifice ends with two transversal  partitions and one longitudinal partition, which mark out, on the same  level, chambers twelve and thirteen, both of which contain males.    There is nothing more curious than this mixing of the two sexes, when  we know with what precision the Osmia separates them in a linear series,  where the narrow width of the cylinder"]]]
