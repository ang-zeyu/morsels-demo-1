I had a foreboding that something was wrong,  and in a few minutes I clearly perceived a man lying upon a make-shift  litter, carried by the camel, while the Sheik Abou Do and Suleiman  accompanied the party upon horseback; a third led Jali's little gray  mare.    They soon arrived beneath the high bank of the river upon which I stood.  Poor little Jali, my plucky and active ally, lay, as I thought, dead  upon the litter. We laid him gently upon my angarep, which I had raised  by four men, so that we could lower him gradually from the kneeling  camel, and we carried him to the camp, about thirty yards distant. He  was faint, and I poured some essence of peppermint (the only spirits  I possessed) down his throat, which quickly revived him. His thigh  was broken about eight inches above the knee, but fortunately it was a  simple fracture.    Abou Do now explained the cause of the accident. While the party of  camel, men and others were engaged in cutting up the dead elephants, the  three aggageers had found the track of a bull that had escaped wounded.  In that country, where there was no drop of water upon the east bank of  the Settite for a distance of sixty or seventy miles to the river Gash,  an elephant, if wounded, was afraid to trust itself to the interior. One  of our escaped elephants had therefore returned to the thick jungle, and  was tracked by the aggageers to a position within two or three  hundred yards of the dead elephants. As there were no guns, two of the  aggageers, utterly reckless of consequences, resolved to ride through  the narrow passages formed by the large game, and to take their chance  with the elephant, sword in hand. Jali, as usual, was the first to lead,  and upon his little gray mare he advanced with the greatest difficulty  through the entangled thorns, broken by the passage of heavy game; to  the right and left of the passage it was impossible to move. Abou Do had  wisely dismounted, but Suleiman followed Jali. Upon arriving within a  few yards of the elephant, which was invisible in the thick thorns, Abou  Do crept forward on foot, and discovered it standing with ears cocked,  evidently waiting for the attack. As Jali followed on his light gray  mare, the elephant immediately perceived the white color and at once  charged forward. Escape was next to impossible. Jali turned his snare  sharply around, and she bounded off; but, caught in the thorns, the mare  fell, throwing her rider in the path of the elephant that was within  a few feet behind, in full chase. The mare recovered herself in an  instant, and rushed away; the elephant, attracted by the white color of  the animal, neglected the man, upon whom it trod in the pursuit, thus  breaking his thigh. Abou Do, who had been between the elephant and Jali,  had wisely jumped into the thick thorns, and, as the elephant passed  him, he again sprang out behind and followed with his drawn sword, but  too late to save Jali, as it was the affair of an instant. Jumping over  Jali's body, he was just in time to deliver a tremendous cut at the hind  leg of the elephant, that must otherwise have killed both horses and  probably Suleiman also, as the three were caught in a cul de sac, in a  passage that had no outlet, and were at the elephant's mercy.    Abou Do seldom failed. It was a difficult feat to strike correctly in  the narrow jungle passage with the elephant in full speed; but the blow  was fairly given, and the back sinew was divided. Not content with the  success of the cut, he immediately repeated the stroke upon the other  leg, as he feared that the elephant, although disabled from rapid  motion, might turn and trample Jali. The extraordinary dexterity and  courage required to effect this can hardly be appreciated by those who  have never hunted a wild elephant; but the extreme agility, pluck, and  audacity of these Hamran sword-hunters surpass all feats that I have  ever witnessed.    I set Jali's broken thigh and attended to him for four days. He was a  very grateful but unruly patient, as he had never been accustomed to  remain quiet. At the end of that time we arranged an angarep comfortably  upon a camel, upon which he was transported to Geera, in company with a  long string of camels, heavily laden with dried meat and squares of hide  for shields, with large bundles of hippopotamus skin for whip-making,  together with the various spoils of the chase. Last but not least were  numerous leathern pots of fat that had been boiled down from elephants  and hippopotami.    The camels were to return as soon as possible with supplies of corn for  our people and horses. Another elephant-hunter was to be sent to us in  the place of Jali, but I felt that we had lost our best man.        CHAPTER IX.    Fright of the Tokrooris--Deserters who didn't desert--Arrival of  the Sherrif brothers--Now for a tally-ho!--On the heels of the  rhinoceroses--The Abyssinian rhinoceros--Every man for himself.    Although my people had been in the highest spirits up to this time, a  gloom had been thrown over the party by two causes--Jali's accident and  the fresh footmarks of the Bas-e that had been discovered upon the sand  by the margin of the river. The aggageers feared nothing, and if the  Bas-e had been legions of demons they would have faced them, sword in  hand, with the greatest pleasure. But my Tokrooris, who were brave in  some respects, had been so cowed by the horrible stories recounted of  these common enemies at the nightly camp-fires by the Hamran Arabs, that  they were seized with panic and resolved to desert en masse and return  to Katariff, where I had originally engaged them, and at which place  they had left their families.    In this instance the desertion of my Tokrooris would have been a  great blow to my expedition, as it was necessary to have a division of  parties. I had the Tokrooris, Jaleens, and Hamran Arabs. Thus they would  never unite together, and I was certain to have some upon my side in a  difficulty. Should I lose the Tokrooris, the Hamran Arabs would have the  entire preponderance.    The whole of my Tokrooris formed in line before me and my wife, just as  the camels were about to leave. Each man had his little bundle prepared  for starting on a journey. Old Moosa was the spokesman. He said that  they were all very sorry; that they regretted exceedingly the necessity  of leaving us, but some of them were sick, and they would only be a  burden to the expedition; that one of them was bound upon a pilgrimage  to Mecca, and that God would punish him should he neglect this great  duty; others had not left any money with their families in Katariff,  that would starve in their absence. (I had given them an advance  of wages, when they engaged at Katariff, to provide against this  difficulty.) I replied: \"My good fellows, I am very sorry to hear all  this, especially as it comes upon me so suddenly; those who are sick  stand upon one side\" (several invalids, who looked remarkably healthy,  stepped to the left). \"Who wishes to go to Mecca?\" Abderachman stepped  forward (a huge specimen of a Tokroori, who went by the nickname of \"El  Jamoos\" or the buffalo). \"Who wishes to remit money to his family, as I  will send it and deduct it from his wages?\" No one came forward.  During the pause I called for pen and paper, which Mahomet brought. I  immediately commenced writing, and placed the note within an envelope,  which I addressed and gave to one of the camel-drivers. I then called  for my medicine-chest, and having weighed several three-grain doses of  tartar emetic, I called the invalids, and insisted upon their taking the  medicine before they started, or they might become seriously ill upon  the road, which for three days' march was uninhabited. Mixed with a  little water the doses were swallowed, and I knew that the invalids were  safe for that day, and that the others would not start without them.    I now again addressed my would-be deserters: \"Now, my good fellows,  there shall be no misunderstanding between us, and I will explain to you  how the case stands. You engaged yourselves to me for the whole journey,  and you received an advance of wages to provide for your families during  your absence. You have lately filled yourselves with meat, and you have  become lazy; you have been frightened by the footprints of the Bas-e;  thus you wish to leave the country. To save yourselves from imaginary  danger, you would forsake my wife and myself, and leave us to a fate  which you yourselves would avoid. This is your gratitude for kindness;  this is the return for my confidence, when without hesitation I advanced  you money. Go! Return to Katariff to your families! I know that all  the excuses you have made are false. Those who declare themselves to be  sick, Inshallah (please God), shall be sick. You will all be welcomed  upon your arrival at Katariff. In the letter I have written to the  Governor, inclosing your names, I have requested him to give each  man upon his appearance FIVE HUNDRED LASHES WITH THE COORBATCH, FOR  DESERTION, and to imprison him until my return.\"    Checkmate! My poor Tokrooris were in a corner, and in their great  dilemma they could not answer a word. Taking advantage of this moment of  confusion, I called forward \"the buffalo,\" Abderachman, as I had heard  that he really had contemplated a pilgrimage to Mecca. \"Abderachman,\" I  continued, \"you are the only man who has spoken the truth. Go to Mecca!  and may God protect you on the journey! I should not wish to prevent you  from performing your duty as a Mahometan.\"    Never were people more dumbfounded with surprise. They retreated, and  formed a knot in consultation, and in about ten minutes they returned to  me, old Moosa and Hadji Ali both leading the pilgrim Abderachman by the  hands. They had given in; and Abderachman, the buffalo of the party,  thanked me for my permission, and with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32426"],[0,"A Synopsis of the North American Lagomorpha (#18)"],[1,".
