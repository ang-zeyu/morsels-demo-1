The Story Girl twisted a spray of divinest pink in her brown  curls, and told us an old legend of a beautiful Indian maiden who died  of a broken heart when the first snows of winter were falling, because  she believed her long-absent lover was false. But he came back in the  spring time from his long captivity; and when he heard that she was dead  he sought her grave to mourn her, and lo, under the dead leaves of the  old year he found sweet sprays of a blossom never seen before, and  knew that it was a message of love and remembrance from his dark-eyed  sweet-heart.    \"Except in stories Indian girls are called squaws,\" remarked practical  Dan, tying his mayflowers together in one huge, solid, cabbage-like  bunch. Not for Dan the bother of filling his basket with the loose  sprays, mingled with feathery elephant's-ears and trails of creeping  spruce, as the rest of us, following the Story Girl's example, did. Nor  would he admit that ours looked any better than his.    \"I like things of one kind together. I don't like them mixed,\" he said.    \"You have no taste,\" said Felicity.    \"Except in my mouth, best beloved,\" responded Dan.    \"You do think you are so smart,\" retorted Felicity, flushing with anger.    \"Don't quarrel this lovely day,\" implored Cecily.    \"Nobody's quarrelling, Sis. I ain't a bit mad. It's Felicity. What on  earth is that at the bottom of your basket, Cecily?\"    \"It's a History of the Reformation in France,\" confessed poor Cecily,  \"by a man named D-a-u-b-i-g-n-y. I can't pronounce it. I heard Mr.  Marwood saying it was a book everyone ought to read, so I began it  last Sunday. I brought it along today to read when I got tired picking  flowers. I'd ever so much rather have brought Ester Reid. There's so  much in the history I can't understand, and it is so dreadful to read of  people being burned to death. But I felt I OUGHT to read it.\"    \"Do you really think your mind has improved any?\" asked Sara Ray  seriously, wreathing the handle of her basket with creeping spruce.    \"No, I'm afraid it hasn't one bit,\" answered Cecily sadly. \"I feel that  I haven't succeeded very well in keeping my resolutions.\"    \"I've kept mine,\" said Felicity complacently.    \"It's easy to keep just one,\" retorted Cecily, rather resentfully.    \"It's not so easy to think beautiful thoughts,\" answered Felicity.    \"It's the easiest thing in the world,\" said the Story Girl, tiptoeing to  the edge of the pool to peep at her own arch reflection, as some nymph  left over from the golden age might do. \"Beautiful thoughts just crowd  into your mind at times.\"    \"Oh, yes, AT TIMES. But that's different from thinking one REGULARLY at  a given hour. And mother is always calling up the stairs for me to hurry  up and get dressed, and it's VERY hard sometimes.\"    \"That's so,\" conceded the Story Girl. \"There ARE times when I can't  think anything but gray thoughts. Then, other days, I think pink and  blue and gold and purple and rainbow thoughts all the time.\"    \"The idea! As if thoughts were coloured,\" giggled Felicity.    \"Oh, they are!\" cried the Story Girl. \"Why, I can always SEE the colour  of any thought I think. Can't you?\"    \"I never heard of such a thing,\" declared Felicity, \"and I don't believe  it. I believe you are just making that up.\"    \"Indeed I'm not. Why, I always supposed everyone thought in colours. It  must be very tiresome if you don't.\"    \"When you think of me what colour is it?\" asked Peter curiously.    \"Yellow,\" answered the Story Girl promptly. \"And Cecily is a sweet pink,  like those mayflowers, and Sara Ray is very pale blue, and Dan is red  and Felix is yellow, like Peter, and Bev is striped.\"    \"What colour am I?\" asked Felicity, amid the laughter at my expense.    \"You're--you're like a rainbow,\" answered the Story Girl rather  reluctantly. She had to be honest, but she would rather not have  complimented Felicity. \"And you needn't laugh at Bev. His stripes are  beautiful. It isn't HE that is striped. It's just the THOUGHT of him.  Peg Bowen is a queer sort of yellowish green and the Awkward Man is  lilac. Aunt Olivia is pansy-purple mixed with gold, and Uncle Roger is  navy blue.\"    \"I never heard such nonsense,\" declared Felicity. The rest of us were  rather inclined to agree with her for once. We thought the Story Girl  was making fun of us. But I believe she really had a strange gift of  thinking in colours. In later years, when we were grown up, she told  me of it again. She said that everything had colour in her thought; the  months of the year ran through all the tints of the spectrum, the days  of the week were arrayed as Solomon in his glory, morning was golden,  noon orange, evening crystal blue, and night violet. Every idea came to  her mind robed in its own especial hue. Perhaps that was why her voice  and words had such a charm, conveying to the listeners' perception such  fine shadings of meaning and tint and music.    \"Well, let's go and have something to eat,\" suggested Dan. \"What colour  is eating, Sara?\"    \"Golden brown, just the colour of a molasses cooky,\" laughed the Story  Girl.    We sat on the ferny bank of the pool and ate of the generous basket Aunt  Janet had provided, with appetites sharpened by the keen spring air and  our wilderness rovings. Felicity had made some very nice sandwiches of  ham which we all appreciated except Dan, who declared he didn't like  things minced up and dug out of the basket a chunk of boiled pork which  he proceeded to saw up with a jack-knife and devour with gusto.    \"I told ma to put this in for me. There's some CHEW to it,\" he said.    \"You are not a bit refined,\" commented Felicity.    \"Not a morsel, my love,\" grinned Dan.    \"You make me think of a story I heard Uncle Roger telling about Cousin  Annetta King,\" said the Story Girl. \"Great-uncle Jeremiah King used to  live where Uncle Roger lives now, when Grandfather King was alive and  Uncle Roger was a boy. In those days it was thought rather coarse for a  young lady to have too hearty an appetite, and she was more admired if  she was delicate about what she ate. Cousin Annetta set out to be very  refined indeed. She pretended to have no appetite at all. One afternoon  she was invited to tea at Grandfather King's when they had some special  company--people from Charlottetown. Cousin Annetta said she could hardly  eat anything. 'You know, Uncle Abraham,' she said, in a very affected,  fine-young-lady voice, 'I really hardly eat enough to keep a bird alive.  Mother says she wonders how I continue to exist.' And she picked and  pecked until Grandfather King declared he would like to throw something  at her. After tea Cousin Annetta went home, and just about dark  Grandfather King went over to Uncle Jeremiah's on an errand. As he  passed the open, lighted pantry window he happened to glance in, and  what do you think he saw? Delicate Cousin Annetta standing at the  dresser, with a big loaf of bread beside her and a big platterful of  cold, boiled pork in front of her; and Annetta was hacking off great  chunks, like Dan there, and gobbling them down as if she was starving.  Grandfather King couldn't resist the temptation. He stepped up to the  window and said, 'I'm glad your appetite has come back to you, Annetta.  Your mother needn't worry about your continuing to exist as long as you  can tuck away fat, salt pork in that fashion.'    \"Cousin Annetta never forgave him, but she never pretended to be  delicate again.\"    \"The Jews don't believe in eating pork,\" said Peter.    \"I'm glad I'm not a Jew and I guess Cousin Annetta was too,\" said Dan.    \"I like bacon, but I can never look at a pig without wondering if they  were ever intended to be eaten,\" remarked Cecily naively.    When we finished our lunch the barrens were already wrapping themselves  in a dim, blue dusk and falling upon rest in dell and dingle. But out  in the open there was still much light of a fine emerald-golden sort and  the robins whistled us home in it. \"Horns of Elfland\" never sounded more  sweetly around hoary castle and ruined fane than those vesper calls  of the robins from the twilight spruce woods and across green pastures  lying under the pale radiance of a young moon.    When we reached home we found that Miss Reade had been up to the hill  farm on an errand and was just leaving. The Story Girl went for a walk  with her and came back with an important expression on her face.    \"You look as if you had a story to tell,\" said Felix.    \"One is growing. It isn't a whole story yet,\" answered the Story Girl  mysteriously.    \"What is it?\" asked Cecily.    \"I can't tell you till it's fully grown,\" said the Story Girl. \"But  I'll tell you a pretty little story the Awkward Man told us--told  me--tonight. He was walking in his garden as we went by, looking at his  tulip beds. His tulips are up ever so much higher than ours, and I asked  him how he managed to coax them along so early. And he said HE didn't do  it--it was all the work of the pixies who lived in the woods across  the brook. There were more pixy babies than usual this spring, and the  mothers were in a hurry for the cradles. The tulips are the pixy babies'  cradles, it seems. The mother pixies come out of the woods at twilight  and rock their tiny little brown babies to sleep in the tulip cups. That  is the reason why tulip blooms last so much longer than other blossoms.  The pixy babies must have a cradle until they are grown up. They grow  very fast, you see, and the Awkward Man says on a spring evening, when  the tulips are out, you can hear the sweetest, softest, clearest, fairy  music in his garden, and it is the pixy folk singing as they rock the  pixy babies to sleep.\"    \"Then the Awkward Man says what isn't true,\" said Felicity severely.

A SURPRISING ANNOUNCEMENT      \"Nothing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3163"],[0,"Birds and Bees, Sharp Eyes, and Other Papers (#18)"],[1,"the latter  escaped by taking refuge in a small hole in a tree. One day in early  spring he saw two hen-hawks that were circling and screaming high in  air, approach each other, extend a claw, and, clasping them together,  fall toward the earth flapping and struggling as if they were tied  together; on nearing the ground they separated and soared aloft again.  He supposed that it was not a passage of war but of love, and that the  hawks were toying fondly with each other.    He further relates a curious circumstance of finding a humming-bird in  the upper part of a barn with its bill stuck fast in a crack of one of  the large timbers, dead, of course, with wings extended, and as dry as a  chip. The bird seems to have died as it had lived, on the wing, and its  last act was indeed a ghastly parody of its living career. Fancy this  nimble, flashing sprite, whose life was passed probing the honeyed  depths of flowers, at last thrusting its bill into a crack in a dry  timber in a hayloft, and, with spread wings, ending its existence.    When the air is damp and heavy, swallows frequently hawk for insects  about cattle and moving herds in the field. My farmer describes how  they attended him one foggy day, as he was mowing in the meadow with a  mowing-machine. It had been foggy for two days, and the swallows were  very hungry, and the insects stupid and inert. When the sound of his  machine was heard, the swallows appeared and attended him like a brood  of hungry chickens. He says there was a continued rush of purple wings  over the \"cut-bar,\" and just where it was causing the grass to tremble  and fall. Without his assistance the swallows would doubtless have gone  hungry yet another day.    Of the hen-hawk, he has observed that both male and female take part in  incubation. \"I was rather surprised,\" he says, \"on one occasion, to  see how quickly they change places on the nest. The nest was in a tall  beech, and the leaves were not yet fully out. I could see the head and  neck of the hawk over the edge of the nest, when I saw the other hawk  coming down through the air at full speed. I expected he would alight  near by, but instead of that he struck directly upon the nest, his mate  getting out of the way barely in time to avoid being hit; it seemed  almost as if he had knocked her off the nest. I hardly see how they can  make such a rush on the nest without danger to the eggs.\"    The king-bird will worry the hawk as a whiffet dog will worry a bear. It  is by his persistence and audacity, not by any injury he is capable of  dealing his great antagonist. The king-bird seldom more than dogs the  hawk, keeping above and between his wings, and making a great ado; but  my correspondent says he once \"saw a king-bird riding on a hawk's  back. The hawk flew as fast as possible, and the king-bird sat upon his  shoulders in triumph until they had passed out of sight,\"--tweaking his  feathers, no doubt, and threatening to scalp him the next moment.    That near relative of the king-bird, the great crested fly-catcher,  has one well known peculiarity: he appears never to consider his nest  finished until it contains a cast-off snake-skin. My alert correspondent  one day saw him eagerly catch up an onion skin and make off with it,  either deceived by it or else thinking it a good substitute for the  coveted material.    One day in May, walking in the woods, I came upon the nest of a  whippoorwill, or rather its eggs, for it builds no nest,--two elliptical  whitish spotted eggs lying upon the dry leaves. My foot was within a  yard of the mother-bird before she flew. I wondered what a sharp eye  would detect curious or characteristic in the ways of the bird, so I  came to the place many times and had a look. It was always a task to  separate the bird from her surroundings though I stood within a few feet  of her, and knew exactly where to look. One had to bear on with his eye,  as it were, and refuse to be baffled. The sticks and leaves, and bits of  black or dark-brown bark, were all exactly copied in the bird's plumage.  And then she did sit so close, and simulate so well a shapeless decaying  piece of wood or bark! Twice I brought a companion, and guiding his eye  to the spot, noted how difficult it was for him to make out there, in  full view upon the dry leaves, any semblance to a bird. When the bird  returned after being disturbed, she would alight within a few inches of  her eggs, and then, after a moment's pause, hobble awkwardly upon them.    After the young had appeared, all the wit of the bird came into play. I  was on hand the next day, I think. The mother-bird sprang up when I was  within a pace of her, and in doing so fanned the leaves with her wings  till they sprang up too; as the leaves started the young started, and,  being of the same color, to tell which was the leaf and which the bird  was a trying task to any eye. I came the next day, when the same tactics  were repeated. Once a leaf fell upon one of the young birds and  nearly hid it. The young are covered with a reddish down like a young  partridge, and soon follow their mother about. When disturbed, they gave  but one leap, then settled down, perfectly motionless and stupid, with  eyes closed. The parent bird, on these occasions made frantic efforts  to decoy me away from her young. She would fly a few paces and fall  upon her breast, and a spasm, like that of death, would run through her  tremulous outstretched wings and prostrate body. She kept a sharp eye  out the meanwhile to see if the ruse took, and if it did not, she was  quickly cured, and moving about to some other point tried to draw my  attention as before. When followed she always alighted upon the ground,  dropping down in a sudden peculiar way. The second or third day both old  and young had disappeared.    The whippoorwill walks as awkwardly as a swallow, which is as awkward as  a man in a bag, and yet she manages to lead her young about the woods.  The latter, I think, move by leaps and sudden spurts, their protective  coloring shielding them most effectively. Wilson once came upon the  mother-bird and her brood in the woods, and, though they were at his  very feet, was so baffled by the concealment of the young that he  was about to give up the search, much disappointed, when he perceived  something \"like a slight moldiness among the withered leaves, and,  on stooping down, discovered it to be a young whippoorwill seemingly  asleep.\" Wilson's description of the young is very accurate, as its  downy covering does look precisely like a \"slight moldiness.\" Returning  a few moments afterward to the spot to get a pencil he had forgotten, he  could find neither old nor young.    It takes an eye to see a partridge in the woods motionless upon the  leaves; this sense needs to be as sharp as that of smell in hounds and  pointers; and yet I know an unkempt youth that seldom fails to see the  bird and shoot it before it takes wing. I think he sees it as soon as it  sees him and before it suspects itself seen. What a training to the eye  is hunting! To pick out the game from its surroundings, the grouse  from the leaves, the gray squirrel from the mossy oak limb it hugs so  closely, the red fox from the ruddy or brown or gray field, the rabbit  from the stubble, or the white hare from the snow requires the best  powers of this sense. A woodchuck, motionless in the fields or upon  a rock, looks very much like a large stone or bowlder, yet a keen eye  knows the difference at a glance, a quarter of a mile away.    A man has a sharper eye than a dog, or a fox, or than any of the wild  creatures, but not so sharp an ear or nose. But in the birds he finds  his match. How quickly the old turkey discovers the hawk, a mere speck  against the sky, and how quickly the hawk discovers you if you happen to  be secreted in the bushes or behind the fence near which he alights!  One advantage the bird surely has, and that is, owing to the form,  structure, and position of the eye, it has a much larger field of  vision--indeed, can probably see in nearly every direction at the same  instant, behind as well as before. Man's field of vision embraces less  than half a circle horizontally, and still less vertically; his brow and  brain prevent him from seeing within many degrees of the zenith without  a movement of the head; the bird on the other hand, takes in nearly the  whole sphere at a glance.    I find I see almost without effort nearly every bird within sight in the  field or wood I pass through (a flit of the wing, a flirt of the tail  are enough, though the flickering leaves do all conspire to hide them),  and that with like ease the birds see me, though, unquestionably, the  chances are immensely in their favor. The eye sees what it has the means  of seeing, truly. You must have the bird in your heart before you can  find it in the bush. The eye must have purpose and aim. No one ever yet  found the walking fern who did not have the walking fern in his mind. A  person whose eye is full of Indian relics picks them up in every field  he walks through.    One season I was interested in the tree-frogs; especially the tiny piper  that one hears about the woods and brushy fields--the hyla of the swamps  become a denizen of the trees; I had never seen him in this new role.  But this season, having hylas in mind, or rather being ripe for them, I  several times came across them. One Sunday, walking amid some bushes,  I captured two. They leaped before me as doubtless they had done many  times before; but though I was not looking for or thinking of them, yet  they were quickly recognized, because the eye had been commissioned  to find them. On another occasion, not long afterward, I was hurriedly  loading my gun in the October woods in hopes of overtaking a gray  squirrel that was fast escaping through the tree-tops, when one of these  lilliput frogs, the color of the fast-yellowing leaves, leaped near me.
