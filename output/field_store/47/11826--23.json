[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24409"],[0,"Our Common Insects (#18)"],[1," alternation of generations, or parthenogenesis, of  embryology and biology, owe their great advance, in large degree, to the  study of such animals as are parasitic, and the question whether the  origin of species be due to creation by the action of secondary laws or  not, will be largely met and answered by the study of the varied  metamorphoses and modes of growth, the peculiar modification of organs  that adapt them to their strange modes of life, and the consequent  variation in specific characters so remarkably characteristic of those  animals living parasitically upon others.[6]    With these considerations in view surely a serious, thoughtful, and  thorough study of the louse, in all its varieties and species, is  neither belittling nor degrading, nor a waste of time. We venture to  say, moreover, that more light will be thrown on the classification and  morphology of insects by the study of the parasitic species, and other  degraded, wingless forms that do not always live parasitically,  especially of their embryology and changes after leaving the egg, than  by years of study of the more highly developed insects alone. Among  Hymenoptera the study of the minute Ichueumons, such as the  Proctotrupids and Chalcids, especially the egg-parasites; among moths  the study of the wingless canker-worm moth and Orgyla; among Diptera the  flea, bee louse, sheep tick, bat tick, and other wingless flies; among  Coleoptera, the Meloe, and singular Stylops and Xenos; among Neuroptera,  the snow insect, Boreus, the Podura (Fig. 109) and Lepisma, and  especially the hemipterous lice, will throw a flood of light on these  prime subjects in philosophical entomology.    [Illustration: 109. Podura.]    Without farther apology, then, and very dependent on the labors of  others for our information, we will say a few words on some interesting  points in the natural history of lice. In the first place, how does the  louse bite? It is the general opinion among physicians, supported by  able entomologists, that the louse has jaws, and bites. But while the  bird lice (Mallophaga) do have biting jaws, whence the Germans call them  skin-eaters (_pelzfresser_), the mouth parts of the genus Pediculus, or  true louse, resemble in their structure those of the bed-bug (Fig. 110),  and other Hemiptera. In its form the louse closely resembles the  bed-bug, and the two groups of lice, the Pediculi and Mallophaga, should  be considered as families of Hemiptera, though degraded and at the base  of the hemipterous series. The resemblance is carried out in the form of  the egg, the mode of growth of the embryo, and the metamorphosis of the  insect after leaving its egg.    [Illustration: 110. Bed-bug.]    Schioedte, a Danish entomologist, has, it seems to us, forever settled  the question as to whether the louse bites the flesh or sucks blood, and  decides a point interesting to physicians, _i.e._, that the loathsome  disease called phthiriasis is a nonentity. From this source not only  many living in poverty and squalor are said to have died, but also men  of renown, among whom Denny in his work on the Anoplura, or lice, of  Great Britain, mentions the name of \"Pheretima, as recorded by  Herodotus, Antiochus Epiphanes, the Dictator Sylla, the two Herods, the  Emperor Maximian, and Phillip the Second.\" Schioedte, in his essay \"On  Phthirius, and on the Structure of the Mouth in Pediculus\" (Annals and  Magazine of Natural History, 1866, page 213), says that these statements  will not bear examination, and that this disease should be placed on the  \"retired list,\" for such a malady is impossible to be produced by simply  blood-sucking animals, and that they are only the disgusting attendants  on other diseases. Our author thus describes the mouth parts of the  louse.    \"Lice are no doubt to be regarded as bugs, simplified in structure and  lowered in animal life in accordance with their mode of living as  parasites, being small, flattened, apterous, myopic, crawling and  climbing, with a conical head, moulded as it were to suit the rugosities  of the surface they inhabit, provided with a soft, transversely furrowed  skin, probably endowed with an acute sense of feeling, which can guide  them in that twilight in which their mode of life places them. The  peculiar attenuation of the head in front of the antennae at once  suggests to the practised eye the existence of a mouth adapted for  suction. This mouth differs from that of the Hemiptera (bed-bug, etc.)  generally, in the circumstance that the labium is capable of being  retracted into the upper part of the head, which therefore presents a  little fold, which is extended when the labium is protruded. In order to  strengthen this part, a flat band of chitine is placed on the under  surface, just as the shoemaker puts a small piece of gutta-percha into  the back of an India-rubber shoe; as, however, the chitine is not very  elastic, this band is rather thinner in the middle, in order that it may  bend and fold a little when the skin is not extended by the lower lip.  The latter consists, as usual, of two hard lateral pieces, of which the  fore ends are united by a membrane so that they form a tube, of which  the interior covering is a continuation of the elastic membrane in the  top of the head; inside its orifice there are a number of small hooks,  which assume different positions according to the degree of protrusion;  if this is at its highest point the orifice is turned inside out, like a  collar, whereby the small hooks are directed backwards, so that they can  serve as barbs. These are the movements which the animal executes after  having first inserted the labium through a sweat-pore. When the hooks  have got a firm hold, the first pair of setae (the real mandibles  transformed) are protruded; these are, towards their points, united by a  membrane so as to form a closed tube, from which, again, is inserted the  second pair of setae, or maxillae, which in the same manner are  transformed into a tube ending in four small lobes placed crosswise. It  follows that when the whole instrument is exserted, we perceive a long  membranous flexible tube hanging down from the labium, and along the  walls of this tube the setiform mandibles and maxillae in the shape of  long narrow bands of chitine. In this way the tube of suction can be  made longer or shorter as required, and easily adjusted to the thickness  of the skin in the particular place where the animal is sucking, whereby  access to the capillary system is secured at any part of the body. It is  apparent, from the whole structure of the instrument, that it is by no  means calculated on being used as a sting, but is rather to be compared  to a delicate elastic probe, in the use of which the terminal lobes  probably serve as feelers. As soon as the capillary system is reached,  the blood will at once ascend into the narrow tube, after which the  current is continued with increasing rapidity by means of the pulsation  of the pumping ventricle and the powerful peristaltic movement of the  digestive tube.\"    [Illustration:[7]111. Mouth of the Louse.]    If we compare the form of the louse (Fig. 112, Pediculus capitis, the  head louse; Fig. 113, P. vestimenti, the body louse) with the young  bed-bug as figured by Westwood (Modern Classification of Insects, ii,.p.  475) we shall see a very close resemblance, the head of the young Cimex  being proportionally larger than in the adult, while the thorax is  smaller, and the abdomen is more ovate, less rounded; moreover the body  is white and partially transparent.    [Illustration: 113. Body Louse.]    [Illustration: 112. Head Louse.]    Under a high power of the microscope specimens treated with diluted  potash show that the mandibles and maxillae arise near each other in the  middle of the head opposite the eyes, their bases slightly diverging.  Thence they converge to the mouth, over which they meet, and beyond are  free, being hollow, thin bands of chitine, meeting like the maxillae, or  tongue, of butterflies to form a hollow tube for suction. The mandibles  each suddenly end in a curved, slender filament, which is probably used  as a tactile organ to explore the best sites in the flesh of their  victim for drawing blood. On the other hand the maxillae, which are much  narrower than the mandibles, become rounded towards the end, bristle  like, and tipped with numerous exceedingly fine barbs, by which the bug  anchors itself in the flesh, while the blood is pumped through the  mandibles. The base of the large, tubular labium, or beak, which  ensheathes the mandibles and maxillae, is opposite the end of the clypeus  or front edge of the upper side of the head, and at a distance beyond  the mouth equal to the breadth of the labium itself. The labium, which  is divided into three joints, becomes flattened towards the tip, which  is square, and ends in two thin membranous lobes, probably endowed with  a slight sense of touch. On comparing these parts with those of the  louse, it will be seen how much alike they are with the exception of the  labium, a very variable organ in the Hemiptera. From the long sucker of  the Pediculus, to the stout chitinous jaws of the Mallophaga, or bird  lice, is a sudden transition, but on comparing the rest of the head and  body it will be seen that the distinction only amounts to a family one,  though Burmeister placed the Mallophaga among the Orthoptera  (grasshoppers and crickets) on account of the mandibles being adapted  for biting. It has been a common source of error to depend too much upon  one or a single set of organs. Insects have been classified on  characters drawn from the wings, or the number of the joints of the  tarsi, or the form of the mouth parts. We must take into account in  endeavoring to ascertain the limits of natural groups, as the internal  anatomy and the embryology and metamorphosis of insects, before we can  hope to obtain a natural"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2441"],[0,"The Burgess Animal Book for Children (#18)"],[1,"from young fruit trees all the way around as high as he  can reach, and of course this kills the trees.  He is worse than  Peter Rabbit.    \"Danny didn't mention that he is a good swimmer and not at all  afraid of the water.  No one has more enemies than he, and the fact  that he is alive and here at school this morning is due to his  everlasting watchfulness.  This will do for to-day.  To-morrow we  will take up others of the Mouse family.\"        CHAPTER XVI  Danny's Northern Cousins and Nimbleheels    Whitefoot the Wood Mouse and Danny Meadow Mouse had become so  interested that they decided they couldn't afford to miss the next  lesson.  Neither did either of them feel like making the long  journey to his home and back again.  So Whitefoot found a hole in  a stump near by and decided to camp out there for a few days.  Danny  decided to do the same thing in a comfortable place under a pile of  brush not far away.  So the next morning both were on hand when  school opened.    \"I told you yesterday that I would tell you about some of Danny's  cousins,\" began Old Mother Nature just as Chatterer the Red Squirrel,  who was late, came hurrying up quite out of breath.  \"Way up in the  Far North are two of Danny's cousins more closely related to him  than to any other members of the Mouse family.  Yet, strange to say,  they are not called Mice at all, but Lemmings.  However, they belong  to the Mouse family.    \"Bandy the Banded Lemming is the most interesting, because he is  the one member of the entire family who changes the color of his  coat.  In summer he wears beautiful shades of reddish brown and  gray, but in winter his coat is wholly white.  He is also called  the Hudson Bay Lemming.    \"Danny Meadow Mouse thinks his tail is short, but he wouldn't if  he should see Bandy's tail.  That is so short it hardly shows beyond  his long fur.  He is about Danny's size, but a little stouter and  stockier, and his long fur makes him appear even thicker-bodied than  he really is.  He has very short legs, and his ears are so small  that they are quite hidden in the fur around them, so that he appears  to have no ears at all.    \"In that same far northern country is a close relative called the  Brown Lemming.  He is very much like Bandy save that he is all brown  and does not change his coat in winter.  Both have the same general  habits, and these are much like the habits of Danny Meadow Mouse.  They make short burrows in the ground leading to snug, warm nests of  grass and moss.  In winter they make little tunnels in every direction  under the snow, with now and then an opening to the surface.    \"There are many more Brown Lemmings than Banded Lemmings, and their  little paths run everywhere through the grass and moss.  In that  country there is a great deal of moss.  It covers the ground just  as grass does here.  But the most interesting thing about these  Lemmings is the way they migrate.  To migrate is to move from one  part of the country to another.  You know most of the birds migrate  to the Sunny South every autumn and back every spring.    \"Once in a while it happens that food becomes very scarce where  the Lemmings are.  Then very many of them get together, just as  migrating birds form great flocks, and start on a long journey in  search of a place where there is plenty of food.  They form a great  army and push ahead, regardless of everything.  They swim wide  rivers and even lakes which may lie in their way.  Of course, they  eat everything eatable in their path.\"    \"My!\" exclaimed Danny Meadow Mouse, \"I'm glad I don't live in a  country where I might have to make such long journeys.  I don't  envy those cousins up there in the Far North a bit.  I'm perfectly  satisfied to live right on the Green Meadows.\"    \"Which shows your good common sense,\" said Old Mother Nature.  \"By  the way, Danny, I suppose you are acquainted with Nimbleheels the  Jumping Mouse, who also is rather fond of the Green Meadows.  I  ought to have sent word to him to be here this morning.\"    Hardly were the words out of Old Mother Nature's mouth when something  landed in the leaves almost at her feet and right in the middle of  school.  Instantly Danny Meadow Mouse scurried under a pile of dead  leaves.  Whitefoot the Wood Mouse darted into a knothole in the log  on which he had been sitting.  Jumper the Hare dodged behind a  little hemlock tree.  Peter Rabbit bolted for a hollow log.  Striped  Chipmunk vanished in a hole under an old stump.  Johnny Chuck backed  up against the trunk of a tree and made ready to fight.  Only Happy  Jack the Gray Squirrel and Chatterer the Red Squirrel and Prickly  Porky the Porcupine, who were sitting in trees, kept their places.  You see they felt quite safe.    As soon as all those who had run had reached places of safety,  they peeped out to see what had frightened them so.  Just imagine  how very, very foolish they felt when they saw Old Mother Nature  smiling down at a little fellow just about the size of little  Whitefoot, but with a much longer tail.  It was Nimbleheels the  Jumping Mouse.    \"Well, well, well,\" exclaimed Old Mother Nature.  \"I was just  speaking of you and wishing I had you here.  How did you happen  to come?  And what do you mean by scaring my pupils half out of  their wits?\"  Her eyes twinkled.  Nimbleheels saw this and knew  that she was only pretending to be severe.    Before he could reply Johnny Chuck began to chuckle.  The chuckle  became a laugh, and presently Johnny was laughing so hard he had  to hold his sides.  Now, as you know, laughter is catching.  In a  minute or so everybody was laughing, and no one but Johnny Chuck  knew what the joke was.  At last Peter Rabbit stopped laughing  long enough to ask Johnny what he was laughing at.    \"At the idea of that little pinch of nothing giving us all such a  fright,\" replied Johnny Chuck.  Then all laughed some more.    When they were through laughing Nimbleheels answered Old Mother  Nature's questions.  He explained that he had heard about that  school, as by this time almost every one in the Green Forest and  on the Green Meadows had.  By chance he learned that Danny Meadow  Mouse was attending.  He thought that if it was a good thing for  Danny it would be a good thing for him, so he had come.    \"Just as I was almost here I heard a twig snap behind me, or thought  I did, and I jumped so as to get here and be safe.  I didn't  suppose anyone would be frightened by little me,\" he explained.  \"It was some jump!\" exclaimed Jumper the Hare admiringly.  \"He  went right over my head, and I was sitting up at that!\"    \"It isn't much of a jump to go over your head,\" replied Nimbleheels.  \"You ought to see me when I really try to jump.  I wasn't half  trying when I landed here.  I'm sorry I frightened all of you so.  It gives me a queer feeling just to think that I should be able  to frighten anybody.  If you please, Mother Nature, am I in time  for to-day's lesson?\"    \"Not for all of it, but you are just in time for the part I wanted  you here for,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"Hop up on that log  side of your Cousin Whitefoot, where all can see you.\"    Nimbleheels hopped up beside Whitefoot the Wood Mouse, and as the  two little cousins sat side by side they were not unlike in general  appearance, though of the two Whitefoot was the prettier.  The coat  of Nimbleheels was a dull yellowish, darker on the back than on the  sides.  Like Whitefoot he was white underneath.  His ears were much  smaller than those of Whitefoot.  But the greatest differences  between the two were in their hind legs and tails.    The hind legs and feet of Nimbleheels were long, on the same plan  as those of Peter Rabbit.  From just a glance at them any one  would know that he was a born jumper and a good one.  Whitefoot  possessed a long tail, but the tail of Nimbleheels was much  longer, slim and tapering.    \"There,\" said Old Mother Nature, \"is the greatest jumper for his  size among all the animals in this great country.  When I say this,  I mean the greatest ground jumper.  Timmy the Flying Squirrel  jumps farther, but Timmy has to climb to a high place and then  coasts down on the air.  I told you what wonderful jumps Jack  Rabbit can make, but if he could jump as high and far for his size  as Nimbleheels can jump for his size, the longest jump Jack has  ever made would seem nothing more than a hop.  By the way, both  Nimbleheels and Whitefoot have small pockets in their cheeks.  Tell us where you live, Nimbleheels.\"    \"I live among the weeds along the edge of the Green Meadows,\"  replied Nimbleheels, \"though sometimes I go way out on the Green  Meadows.  But I like best to be among the weeds because they are  tall and keep me well hidden, and also because they furnish me  plenty to eat.  You see, I live largely on seeds, though I am also  fond of berries and small nuts, especially beechnuts.  Some of my  family prefer the Green Forest, especially if there is a Laughing  Brook or pond in it. Personally I prefer, as I said before, the  edge of the Green Meadows.\"    \"Do you make your home under the ground?\" asked Striped Chipmunk.    \"For winter, yes,\" replied Nimbleheels.  \"In summer I sometimes  put my nest just a few inches under ground, but often I hide it  under a piece of bark or in a thick clump of grass, just as Danny  Meadow Mouse often does his.  In the fall I dig a deep burrow,  deep enough to be beyond the reach of Jack Frost, and in a nice  little bedroom down there I sleep the winter away.  I have little  storerooms down there too, in which I put seeds, berries and nuts.  Then when I do wake up I have plenty to eat.\"    \"I might add,\" said Old Mother Nature, \"that when he goes to sleep  for the winter he curls up in a little ball with his long tail  wrapped around him, and in his bed of soft grass he sleeps very  sound indeed.  Like Johnny Chuck he gets very fat before going to  sleep.  Now, Nimbleheels, show us how you can "]]]
