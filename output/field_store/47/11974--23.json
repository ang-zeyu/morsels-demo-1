St. Aubert, rejoicing in  rest, seated himself in an arm-chair, and his senses were refreshed by  the cool and balmy air, that lightly waved the embowering honeysuckles,  and wafted their sweet breath into the apartment. His host, who was  called La Voisin, quitted the room, but soon returned with fruits,  cream, and all the pastoral luxury his cottage afforded; having set down  which, with a smile of unfeigned welcome, he retired behind the chair of  his guest. St. Aubert insisted on his taking a seat at the table, and,  when the fruit had allayed the fever of his palate, and he found himself  somewhat revived, he began to converse with his host, who communicated  several particulars concerning himself and his family, which were  interesting, because they were spoken from the heart, and delineated  a picture of the sweet courtesies of family kindness. Emily sat by her  father, holding his hand, and, while she listened to the old man, her  heart swelled with the affectionate sympathy he described, and her  tears fell to the mournful consideration, that death would probably  soon deprive her of the dearest blessing she then possessed. The soft  moon-light of an autumnal evening, and the distant music, which now  sounded a plaintive strain, aided the melancholy of her mind. The old  man continued to talk of his family, and St. Aubert remained silent.  'I have only one daughter living,' said La Voisin, 'but she is happily  married, and is every thing to me. When I lost my wife,' he added with  a sigh, 'I came to live with Agnes, and her family; she has several  children, who are all dancing on the green yonder, as merry as  grasshoppers--and long may they be so! I hope to die among them,  monsieur. I am old now, and cannot expect to live long, but there is  some comfort in dying surrounded by one's children.'    'My good friend,' said St. Aubert, while his voice trembled, 'I hope you  will long live surrounded by them.'    'Ah, sir! at my age I must not expect that!' replied the old man, and he  paused: 'I can scarcely wish it,' he resumed, 'for I trust that whenever  I die I shall go to heaven, where my poor wife is gone before me. I can  sometimes almost fancy I see her of a still moon-light night, walking  among these shades she loved so well. Do you believe, monsieur, that  we shall be permitted to revisit the earth, after we have quitted the  body?'    Emily could no longer stifle the anguish of her heart; her tears fell  fast upon her father's hand, which she yet held. He made an effort to  speak, and at length said in a low voice, 'I hope we shall be permitted  to look down on those we have left on the earth, but I can only hope it.  Futurity is much veiled from our eyes, and faith and hope are our only  guides concerning it. We are not enjoined to believe, that disembodied  spirits watch over the friends they have loved, but we may innocently  hope it. It is a hope which I will never resign,' continued he, while  he wiped the tears from his daughter's eyes, 'it will sweeten the bitter  moments of death!' Tears fell slowly on his cheeks; La Voisin wept too,  and there was a pause of silence. Then, La Voisin, renewing the subject,  said, 'But you believe, sir, that we shall meet in another world the  relations we have loved in this; I must believe this.' 'Then do  believe it,' replied St. Aubert, 'severe, indeed, would be the pangs of  separation, if we believed it to be eternal. Look up, my dear Emily,  we shall meet again!' He lifted his eyes towards heaven, and a gleam  of moon-light, which fell upon his countenance, discovered peace and  resignation, stealing on the lines of sorrow.    La Voisin felt that he had pursued the subject too far, and he dropped  it, saying, 'We are in darkness, I forgot to bring a light.'    'No,' said St. Aubert, 'this is a light I love. Sit down, my good  friend. Emily, my love, I find myself better than I have been all day;  this air refreshes me. I can enjoy this tranquil hour, and that music,  which floats so sweetly at a distance. Let me see you smile. Who touches  that guitar so tastefully? are there two instruments, or is it an echo I  hear?'    'It is an echo, monsieur, I fancy. That guitar is often heard at night,  when all is still, but nobody knows who touches it, and it is sometimes  accompanied by a voice so sweet, and so sad, one would almost think the  woods were haunted.' 'They certainly are haunted,' said St. Aubert with  a smile, 'but I believe it is by mortals.' 'I have sometimes heard it  at midnight, when I could not sleep,' rejoined La Voisin, not seeming to  notice this remark, 'almost under my window, and I never heard any music  like it. It has often made me think of my poor wife till I cried. I have  sometimes got up to the window to look if I could see anybody, but as  soon as I opened the casement all was hushed, and nobody to be seen; and  I have listened, and listened till I have been so timorous, that even  the trembling of the leaves in the breeze has made me start. They say  it often comes to warn people of their death, but I have heard it these  many years, and outlived the warning.'    Emily, though she smiled at the mention of this ridiculous superstition,  could not, in the present tone of her spirits, wholly resist its  contagion.    'Well, but, my good friend,' said St. Aubert, 'has nobody had courage to  follow the sounds? If they had, they would probably have discovered who  is the musician.' 'Yes, sir, they have followed them some way into the  woods, but the music has still retreated, and seemed as distant as ever,  and the people have at last been afraid of being led into harm, and  would go no further. It is very seldom that I have heard these sounds so  early in the evening. They usually come about midnight, when that bright  planet, which is rising above the turret yonder, sets below the woods on  the left.'    'What turret?' asked St. Aubert with quickness, 'I see none.'    'Your pardon, monsieur, you do see one indeed, for the moon shines full  upon it;--up the avenue yonder, a long way off; the chateau it belongs  to is hid among the trees.'    'Yes, my dear sir,' said Emily, pointing, 'don't you see something  glitter above the dark woods? It is a fane, I fancy, which the rays fall  upon.'    'O yes, I see what you mean; and who does the chateau belong to?'    'The Marquis de Villeroi was its owner,' replied La Voisin,  emphatically.    'Ah!' said St. Aubert, with a deep sigh, 'are we then so near Le-Blanc!'  He appeared much agitated.    'It used to be the Marquis's favourite residence,' resumed La Voisin,  'but he took a dislike to the place, and has not been there for many  years. We have heard lately that he is dead, and that it is fallen into  other hands.' St. Aubert, who had sat in deep musing, was roused by the  last words. 'Dead!' he exclaimed, 'Good God! when did he die?'    'He is reported to have died about five weeks since,' replied La Voisin.  'Did you know the Marquis, sir?'    'This is very extraordinary!' said St. Aubert without attending to the  question. 'Why is it so, my dear sir?' said Emily, in a voice of timid  curiosity. He made no reply, but sunk again into a reverie; and in a  few moments, when he seemed to have recovered himself, asked who had  succeeded to the estates. 'I have forgot his title, monsieur,' said La  Voisin; 'but my lord resides at Paris chiefly; I hear no talk of his  coming hither.'    'The chateau is shut up then, still?'    'Why, little better, sir; the old housekeeper, and her husband the  steward, have the care of it, but they live generally in a cottage hard  by.'    'The chateau is spacious, I suppose,' said Emily, 'and must be desolate  for the residence of only two persons.'    'Desolate enough, mademoiselle,' replied La Voisin, 'I would not pass  one night in the chateau, for the value of the whole domain.'    'What is that?' said St. Aubert, roused again from thoughtfulness. As  his host repeated his last sentence, a groan escaped from St. Aubert,  and then, as if anxious to prevent it from being noticed, he hastily  asked La Voisin how long he had lived in this neighbourhood. 'Almost  from my childhood, sir,' replied his host.    'You remember the late marchioness, then?' said St. Aubert in an altered  voice.    'Ah, monsieur!--that I do well. There are many besides me who remember  her.'    'Yes--' said St. Aubert, 'and I am one of those.'    'Alas, sir! you remember, then, a most beautiful and excellent lady. She  deserved a better fate.'    Tears stood in St. Aubert's eyes; 'Enough,' said he, in a voice almost  stifled by the violence of his emotions,--'it is enough, my friend.'    Emily, though extremely surprised by her father's manner, forbore to  express her feelings by any question. La Voisin began to apologize, but  St. Aubert interrupted him; 'Apology is quite unnecessary,' said he,  'let us change the topic. You was speaking of the music we just now  heard.'    'I was, monsieur--but hark!--it comes again; listen to that voice!' They  were all silent;     At last a soft and solemn-breathing sound   Rose, like a stream of rich distilled perfumes,   And stole upon the air, that even Silence   Was took ere she was 'ware, and wished she might   Deny her nature, and be never more   Still, to be so displaced.*       *Milton.      In a few moments the voice died into air, and the instrument, which had  been heard before, sounded in low symphony. St. Aubert now observed,  that it produced a tone much more full and melodious than that of a  guitar, and still more melancholy and soft than the lute. They continued  to listen, but the sounds returned no more. 'This is strange!' said St.  Aubert, at length interrupting the silence. 'Very strange!' said Emily.  'It is so,' rejoined La Voisin, and they were again silent.    After a long pause, 'It is now about eighteen years since I first heard  that music,' said La Voisin; 'I remember it was on a fine summer's"]]]
