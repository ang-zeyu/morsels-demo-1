It would be interesting  to know just the nature of the communication that takes place between  them.      THE CROW      I        My friend and neighbor through the year,      Self-appointed overseer        Of my crops of fruit and grain,      Of my woods and furrowed plain,        Claim thy tithings right and left,      I shall never call it theft.        Nature wisely made the law,      And I fail to find a flaw        In thy title to the earth,      And all it holds of any worth.        I like thy self-complacent air,      I like thy ways so free from care,        Thy landlord stroll about my fields,      Quickly noting what each yields;        Thy courtly mien and bearing bold,      As if thy claim were bought with gold;        Thy floating shape against the sky,      When days are calm and clouds are high;        Thy thrifty flight ere rise of sun,      Thy homing clans when day is done.        Hues protective are not thine,      So sleek thy coat each quill doth shine.        Diamond black to end of toe,      Thy counterpoint the crystal snow.      II        Never plaintive nor appealing,      Quite at home when thou art stealing,        Always groomed to tip of feather,      Calm and trim in every weather,        Morn till night my woods policing,      Every sound thy watch increasing.        Hawk and owl in tree-top hiding      Feel the shame of thy deriding.        Naught escapes thy observation,      None but dread thy accusation.      III        Hunters, prowlers, woodland lovers      Vainly seek the leafy covers.        Noisy, scheming, and predacious,      With demeanor almost gracious,        Dowered with leisure, void of hurry,      Void of fuss and void of worry,        Friendly bandit, Robin Hood,      Judge and jury of the wood,        Or Captain Kidd of sable quill,      Hiding treasures in the hill,        Nature made thee for each season,      Gave thee wit for ample reason,        Good crow wit that's always burnished      Like the coat her care has furnished.        May thy numbers ne'er diminish!      I'll befriend thee till life's finish.        May I never cease to meet thee!      May I never have to eat thee!        And mayest thou never have to fare so      That thou playest the part of scarecrow!          THE NORTHERN SHRIKE      Usually the character of a bird of prey is well defined; there is no  mistaking him. His claws, his beak, his head, his wings, in fact his  whole build, point to the fact that he subsists upon live creatures; he  is armed to catch them and to slay them. Every bird knows a hawk and  knows him from the start, and is on the lookout for him. The hawk takes  life, but he does it to maintain his own, and it is a public and  universally known fact. Nature has sent him abroad in that character,  and has advised all creatures of it. Not so with the shrike; here she  has concealed the character of a murderer under a form as innocent as  that of the robin. Feet, wings, tail, color, head, and general form and  size are all those of a song-bird,--very much like that master songster,  the mockingbird,--yet this bird is a regular Bluebeard among its kind.  Its only characteristic feature is its beak, the upper mandible having  two sharp processes and a sharp hooked point. It usually impales its  victim upon a thorn, or thrusts it in the fork of a limb. For the most  part, however, its food seems to consist of insects,--spiders,  grasshoppers, beetles, etc. It is the assassin of the small birds, whom  it often destroys in pure wantonness, or merely to sup on their brains,  as the Gaucho slaughters a wild cow or bull for its tongue. It is a wolf  in sheep's clothing. Apparently its victims are unacquainted with its  true character and allow it to approach them, when the fatal blow is  given. I saw an illustration of this the other day. A large number of  goldfinches in their fall plumage, together with snowbirds and sparrows,  were feeding and chattering in some low bushes back of the barn. I had  paused by the fence and was peeping through at them, hoping to get a  glimpse of that rare sparrow, the white-crowned. Presently I heard a  rustling among the dry leaves as if some larger bird were also among  them. Then I heard one of the goldfinches cry out as if in distress,  when the whole flock of them started up in alarm, and, circling around,  settled in the tops of the larger trees. I continued my scrutiny of the  bushes, when I saw a large bird, with some object in its beak, hopping  along on a low branch near the ground. It disappeared from my sight for  a few moments, then came up through the undergrowth into the top of a  young maple where some of the finches had alighted, and I beheld the  shrike. The little birds avoided him and flew about the tree, their  pursuer following them with the motions of his head and body as if he  would fain arrest them by his murderous gaze. The birds did not utter  the cry or make the demonstration of alarm they usually do on the  appearance of a hawk, but chirruped and called and flew about in a half  wondering, half bewildered manner. As they flew farther along the line  of trees the shrike followed them as if bent on further captures. I then  made my way around to see what the shrike had caught, and what he had  done with his prey. As I approached the bushes I saw the shrike  hastening back. I read his intentions at once. Seeing my movements, he  had returned for his game. But I was too quick for him, and he got up  out of the brush and flew away from the locality. On some twigs in the  thickest part of the bushes I found his victim,--a goldfinch. It was not  impaled upon a thorn, but was carefully disposed upon some horizontal  twigs,--laid upon the shelf, so to speak. It was as warm as in life, and  its plumage was unruffled. On examining it I found a large bruise or  break in the skin on the back of the neck, at the base of the skull.  Here the bandit had no doubt gripped the bird with his strong beak. The  shrike's bloodthirstiness was seen in the fact that he did not stop to  devour his prey, but went in quest of more, as if opening a market of  goldfinches. The thicket was his shambles, and if not interrupted, he  might have had a fine display of titbits in a short time.    The shrike is called a butcher from his habit of sticking his meat upon  hooks and points; further than that, he is a butcher because he devours  but a trifle of what he slays.          THE SCREECH OWL      At one point in the grayest, most shaggy part of the woods, I come  suddenly upon a brood of screech owls, full grown, sitting together upon  a dry, moss-draped limb, but a few feet from the ground. I pause within  four or five yards of them and am looking about me, when my eye lights  upon these gray, motionless figures. They sit perfectly upright, some  with their backs and some with their breasts toward me, but every head  turned squarely in my direction. Their eyes are closed to a mere black  line; through this crack they are watching me, evidently thinking  themselves unobserved. The spectacle is weird and grotesque, and  suggests something impish and uncanny. It is a new effect, the night  side of the woods by daylight. After observing them a moment I take a  single step toward them, when, quick as thought, their eyes fly wide  open, their attitude is changed, they bend, some this way, some that,  and, instinct with life and motion, stare wildly around them. Another  step, and they all take flight but one, which stoops low on the branch,  and with the look of a frightened cat regards me for a few seconds over  its shoulder. They fly swiftly and softly, and disperse through the  trees.           *       *       *       *       *    A winter neighbor of mine, in whom I am interested, and who perhaps  lends me his support after his kind, is a little red owl, whose retreat  is in the heart of an old apple-tree just over the fence. Where he keeps  himself in spring and summer, I do not know, but late every fall, and at  intervals all winter, his hiding-place is discovered by the jays and  nuthatches, and proclaimed from the tree-tops for the space of half an  hour or so, with all the powers of voice they can command. Four times  during one winter they called me out to behold this little ogre feigning  sleep in his den, sometimes in one apple-tree, sometimes in another.  Whenever I heard their cries, I knew my neighbor was being berated. The  birds would take turns at looking in upon him, and uttering their  alarm-notes. Every jay within hearing would come to the spot, and at  once approach the hole in the trunk or limb, and with a kind of  breathless eagerness and excitement take a peep at the owl, and then  join the outcry. When I approached they would hastily take a final look,  and then withdraw and regard my movements intently. After accustoming my  eye to the faint light of the cavity for a few moments, I could usually  make out the owl at the bottom feigning sleep. Feigning, I say, because  this is what he really did, as I first discovered one day when I cut  into his retreat with the axe. The loud blows and the falling chips did  not disturb him at all. When I reached in a stick and pulled him over on  his side, leaving one of his wings spread out, he made no attempt to  recover himself, but lay among the chips and fragments of decayed wood,  like a part of themselves. Indeed, it took a sharp eye to distinguish  him. Not till I had pulled him forth by one wing, rather rudely, did he  abandon his trick of simulated sleep or death. Then, like a detected  pickpocket, he was suddenly transformed into another creature. His eyes  flew wide open, his talons clutched my finger, his ears were depressed,  and every motion and look said, \"Hands off, at your peril.\" Finding this  game did not work, he soon began to \"play possum\" again. I put a cover  over my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26059"],[0,"The Ascent of Denali (Mount McKinley) (#18)"],[1,"opportunity of  knowing than Ogilvie), was also the first man to make written reference  to this mountain, since Vancouver, the great navigator, saw it from the  head of Cook's Inlet in 1794.    Arthur Harper, in company with Al. Mayo, made the earliest exploration  of the Tanana River, ascending that stream in the summer of 1878 to  about the present site of Fairbanks; and in a letter to E. W. Nelson, of  the United States Biological Survey, then on the Alaskan coast, Harper  wrote the following winter of the \"great ice mountain to the south\" as  one of the most wonderful sights of the trip.[6] It is pleasant to think  that a son of his, yet unborn, was to be the first to set foot on its  top; pleasantly also the office of setting his name upon the lofty  glacier, the gleam from which caught his eye and roused his wonder  thirty years ago, falls upon one who has been glad and proud to take, in  some measure, his place.    [Sidenote: Descent]    Then began the difficulty and the danger, the toil and the anxiety, of  the descent of the ridge. Karstens led, then followed Tatum, then the  writer, and then Walter. The unbroken surface of the ridge above the  cleavage is sensationally steep, and during our absence nearly two feet  of new snow had fallen upon it. The steps that had been shovelled as we  ascended were entirely obliterated and it was necessary to shovel new  ones; it was the very heat of the day, and by the canons of climbing we  should have camped at the Pass and descended in the early morning. But  all were eager to get down, and we ventured it. Now that our task was  accomplished, our minds reverted to the boy at the base camp long  anxiously expecting us, and we thought of him and spoke of him  continually and speculated how he had fared. One feels upon reflection  that we took more risk in descending that ridge than we took at any time  in the ascent. But Karstens was most cautious and careful, and in the  long and intensive apprenticeship of this expedition had become most  expert. I sometimes wondered whether Swiss guides would have much to  teach either him or Walter in snow-craft; their chief instruction would  probably be along the line of taking more chances, wisely. If the writer  had to ascend this mountain again he would intrust himself to Karstens  and Walter rather than to any Swiss guides he has known, for ice and  snow in Alaska are not quite the same as ice and snow in the Alps or the  Canadian Rockies.    [Illustration: Beginning the descent of the ridge; looking down 4,000  feet upon the Muldrow Glacier.]    The loose snow was shovelled away and the steps dug in the hard snow  beneath, and the creepers upon our feet gave good grip in it. Thus,  slowly, step by step, we descended the ridge and in an hour and a half  had reached the cleavage, the most critical place in the whole descent.  With the least possible motion of the feet, setting them exactly in the  shovelled steps, we crept like cats across this slope, thrusting the  points of our axes into the holes that had been made in the ice-wall  above, moving all together, the rope always taut, no one speaking a  word. When once Karstens was anchored on the further ice he stood and  gathered up the rope as first one and then another passed safely to him  and anchored himself beside him, until at last we were all across. Then,  stooping to pass the overhanging ice-cliff that here also disputed the  pack upon one's back, we went down to the long, long stretch of jagged  pinnacles and bergs, and our intricate staircase in the masonry of them.  Shovelling was necessary all the way down, but the steps were there,  needing only to be uncovered. Passing our ridge camp, passing the danger  of the great gable, down the rocks by which we reached the ridge and  down the slopes to the glacier floor we went, reaching our old camp at  9.30 P. M., six and a quarter hours from the Parker Pass, twelve hours  from the eighteen-thousand-foot camp in the Grand Basin, our hearts full  of thankfulness that the terrible ridge was behind us. Until we reached  the glacier floor the weather had been clear; almost immediately  thereafter the old familiar cloud smother began to pour down from above  and we saw the heights no more.    [Sidenote: The Glacier Camp]    The camp was in pretty bad shape. The snow that had fallen upon it had  melted and frozen to ice, in the sun's rays and the night frosts, and  weighed the tent down to the ground. But an hour's work made it  habitable again, and we gleefully piled the stove with the last of our  wood and used the last spoonfuls of a can of baking-powder to make a  batch of biscuits, the first bread we had eaten in two weeks.    Next day we abandoned the camp, leaving all standing, and, putting our  packs upon a Yukon sled, rejecting the ice-creepers, and resuming our  rough-locked snow-shoes, we started down the glacier in soft, cloudy  weather to our base camp. Again it had been wiser to have waited till  night, that the snow bridges over the crevasses might be at their  hardest; but we could not wait. Every mind was occupied with Johnny. We  were two weeks overstayed of the time we had told him to expect our  return, and we knew not what might have happened to the boy. The four of  us on one rope, Karstens leading and Walter at the gee-pole, we went  down the first sharp descents of the glaciers without much trouble, the  new, soft snow making a good brake for the sled. But lower down the  crevasses began to give us trouble. The snow bridges were melted at  their edges, and sometimes the sled had to be lowered down to the  portion that still held and hauled up at the other side. Sometimes a  bridge gave way as its edge was cautiously ventured upon with the  snow-shoes, and we had to go far over to the glacier wall to get round  the crevasse. The willows with which we had staked the trail still  stood, sometimes just their tips appearing above the new snow, and they  were a good guide, though we often had to leave the old trail. At last  the crevasses were all passed and we reached the lower portion of the  glacier, which is free of them. Then the snow grew softer and softer,  and our moccasined feet were soon wet through. Large patches of the  black shale with which much of this glacier is covered were quite bare  of snow, and the sled had to be hauled laboriously across them. Then we  began to encounter pools of water, which at first we avoided, but they  soon grew so numerous that we went right through them.    [Sidenote: Flowers]    The going grew steadily wetter and rougher and more disagreeable. The  lower stretch of a glacier is an unhandsome sight in summer: all sorts  of rock debris and ugly black shale, with discolored melting ice and  snow, intersected everywhere with streams of dirty water--this was what  it had degenerated into as we reached the pass. The snow was entirely  gone from the pass, so the sled was abandoned--left standing upright,  with its gee-pole sticking in the air that if any one else ever chanced  to want it it might readily be found. The snow-shoes were piled around  it, and we resumed our packs and climbed up to the pass. The first thing  that struck our eyes as we stood upon the rocks of the pass was a  brilliant trailing purple moss flower of such gorgeous color that we all  exclaimed at its beauty and wondered how it grew clinging to bare rock.  It was the first bright color that we had seen for so long that it gave  unqualified pleasure to us all and was a foretaste of the enhancing  delights that awaited us as we descended to the bespangled valley. If a  man would know to the utmost the charm of flowers, let him exile himself  among the snows of a lofty mountain during fifty days of spring and come  down into the first full flush of summer. We could scarcely pass a  flower by, and presently had our hands full of blooms like schoolgirls  on a picnic.    But although the first things that attracted our attention were the  flowers, the next were the mosquitoes. They were waiting for us at the  pass and they gave us their warmest welcome. The writer took sharp blame  to himself that, organizing and equipping this expedition, he had made  no provision against these intolerable pests. But we had so confidently  expected to come out a month earlier, before the time of mosquitoes  arrived, that although the matter was suggested and discussed it was put  aside as unnecessary. Now there was the prospect of a fifty or sixty  mile tramp across country, subject all the while to the assaults of  venomous insects, which are a greater hindrance to summer travel in  Alaska than any extremity of cold is to winter travel.    Not even the mosquitoes, however, took our minds from Johnny, and a load  was lifted from every heart when we came near enough to our camp to see  that some one was moving about it. A shout brought him running, and he  never stopped until he had met us and had taken the pack from my  shoulders and put it on his own. Our happiness was now unalloyed; the  last anxiety was removed. The dogs gave us most jubilant welcome and  were fat and well favored.    [Sidenote: Johnny and the Sugar]    What a change had come over the place! All the snow was gone from the  hills; the stream that gathered its three forks at this point roared  over its rocks; the stunted willows were in full leaf; the thick, soft  moss of every dark shade of green and yellow and red made a foil for  innumerable brilliant flowers. The fat, gray conies chirped at us from  the rocks; the ground-squirrels, greatly multiplied since the wholesale  destruction of foxes, kept the dogs unavailingly chasing hither and  thither whenever they were loose. We never grew tired of walking up and  down and to and fro about the camp--it was a delight to tread upon the  moss-covered earth after so long treading upon nothing but ice and snow;  it was a delight to gaze out through naked eyes after all those weeks in  which "]]]
