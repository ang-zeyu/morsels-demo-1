The Webbed Jaws shown  above have proved very successful in this respect.    Noting the cross-section of the jaws, as illustrated at the left, it  is plain the animal can only gnaw off its leg at a point quite a  distance below the meeting edges. The flesh above the point of  amputation and below the jaws will swell and make it impossible to  pull the leg stump out of the trap.    The No. 81 Trap corresponds in size with the regular No. 1 Newhouse.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 91 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws--91, 5 1/4 inches; 91 1/2, 6 1/4 inches. The double  jaws take an easy and firm grip so high up on the muskrat that he can  not twist out. A skunk cannot gnaw out either.    These traps are especially good for Muskrat, Mink, Skunk and Raccoon.    All parts of the No. 91 except the jaws are the same size as the  regular No. 1 Newhouse, while the 91 1/2 corresponds to the regular  No. 1 1/2.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 1 1/2 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 4 7/8 inches. This size is called the Mink Trap. It  is, however, suitable for catching the Woodchuck, Skunk, etc.  Professional trappers often use it for catching Foxes. It is very  convenient in form and is strong and reliable.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 2 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 4 7/8 inches.  The No. 2 Trap is called the Fox Trap.  Its spread of jaws is the same as the No. 1 1/2 but having two  springs it is, of course, much stronger.     [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 3 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 5 1/2 inches. This, the Otter Trap, is very powerful.  It will hold almost any game smaller than a bear.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 4 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 6 1/2 inches. This is the regular form of Beaver  Trap. It is longer than the No. 3 Trap, and has one inch greater  spread of jaws. It is a favorite with those who trap and hunt for a  living in the Northwest and Canada. It is also extensively used for  trapping the smaller Wolves and Coyotes in the western stock raising  regions.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 2 1/2 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 6 1/2 inches. In some localities the Otter grows to  an unusual size, with great proportionate strength, so that the  manufacturers have been led to produce an especially large and strong  pattern. All the parts are heavier than the No. 2 1/2, the spread of  jaws greater and the spring stiffer.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 3 1/2 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 5 inches. The above cut represents a Single Spring  Otter Trap. It is used more especially for catching Otter on their  \"slides.\" For this purpose a thin, raised plate of steel is adjusted  to the pan so that when the trap is set the plate will be a trifle  higher than the teeth on the jaws. The spring is very powerful, being  the same as used on the No. 4 Newhouse Trap. The raised plate can be  readily detached if desired, making the trap one of general utility.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 21 1/2 TRAP]    Single Spring. Same as No. 2 1/2 but without Teeth or Raised Plate.    No. 31 1/2 NEWHOUSE TRAP.    Single Spring. Same as No. 3 1/2 but without Teeth or Raised Plate.    Spread of Jaws--No. 21 1/2, 5 1/4 inches; No. 31 1/2, 6 1/2 inches.  These Traps are the largest smooth jaw, single spring sizes that are  made. Professional trappers will find these especially valuable when  on a long trapping line, as they are more compact and easier to  secrete than the large double spring traps. The springs are made  extra heavy.    Note.--The 21 1/2 is practically a single spring No. 3 and the 31 1/2  a single spring No. 4.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 14 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 6 1/2 inches. This Trap is the same in size as the  No. 4 Beaver, but has heavier and stiffer springs and offset jaws,  which allow the springs to raise higher when the animal's leg is in  the trap, and is furnished with teeth sufficiently close to prevent  the animal from pulling its foot out.      [Illustration: CLUTCH DETACHABLE TRAP]    Clutch Detachable--Trap can be used with or without it.    PATENTED.    Spread of Jaws, No. 23, 5 1/2 inches; No. 24, 6 1/4 inches. The  inventor of this attachment claims to have had wonderful success with  it in taking Beaver. The trap should be set with the clutch end  farthest from shore. The beaver swims with his fore legs folded back  against his body, and when he feels his breast touch the bank he puts  them down. The position of the trap can be so calculated that he will  put his fore legs in the trap, when the clutch will seize him across  the body and hold him securely.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 4 1/2 TRAP]    In response to a demand for a new model of the Newhouse Trap  especially adapted to catching wolves, the manufacturers have  perfected a trap which is numbered 4 1/2 and is called the \"Newhouse  Wolf Trap.\"    This trap has eight inches spread of jaw, with other parts in  proportion, and is provided with a pronged \"drag,\" a heavy snap and  an extra heavy steel swivel and chain, five feet long, warranted to  hold 2,000 pounds. The trap complete with chain and \"drag\" weighs  about nine pounds.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 50 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 9 inches. This trap is intended for catching small  sized Bears. In design it is exactly like the standard No. 5 Bear  Trap, only that the parts are all somewhat smaller. Weight, 11 1/4  pounds each.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 150 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 9 inches. This trap is identical with No. 5 excepting  that the jaws are offset, making a space five-eighths inch between  them. This allows the springs to come up higher when the bear's foot  is in the trap, and thus secure a better grip. Also there is less  chance of breaking the bones of the foot. Weight, 11 1/4 pounds each.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 5 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 11 3/4 inches. This trap weighs nineteen pounds. It  is used for taking the common Black Bear and is furnished with a very  strong chain.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 15 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 11 3/4 inches. To meet the views of certain hunters  whose judgment is respected, the manufacturers designed a style of  jaw for the No. 5 trap, making an offset of 3/4 of an inch, so as to  allow the springs to come up higher when the bear's leg is in the  trap. This gives the spring a better grip. Those wishing this style  should specify \"No. 15.\"      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 6 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 16 inches. Weight, complete, 42 pounds. This is the  strongest trap made. We have never heard of anything getting out of  it when once caught. It is used to catch lions and tigers, as well as  the great Grizzly Bears of the Rocky Mountains.      [Illustration: BEAR CHAIN CLEVIS AND BOLT]    This cut illustrates Bear Chain Clevis and Bolt, intended as a  substitute for the ring on the end of the trap chain, when desired.    With this clevis a loop can be made around any small log or tree  without the trouble of cutting to fit the ring. The chain is made  five feet long, suitable for any clog, and the prices of bear traps  fitted with it are the same as with the regular short chain and ring.      [Illustration: TRAP SETTING CLAMP]    Every trapper knows how difficult it is to set a large trap alone in  the woods, especially in cold weather, when the fingers are stiff,  and the difficulty is greatly increased when one has to work in a  boat. One of these clamps applied to each spring will, by a few turns  of the thumb-screws, bend the springs to their places, so that the  pan may be adjusted without difficulty. No. 4 Clamp can be used on  any trap smaller than No. 4 1 /2. No. 5 and 6 are strong clamps,  carefully made and especially adapted to setting the large traps Nos.  4 1/2 to 6. They dispense with the inconvenient and dangerous use of  levers. With them one can easily set these powerful traps. These  clamps are also useful about camp for other purposes.

The fur of the  Bay Lynx is not as valuable as that of the northern lynx. It becomes  prime in the north about the first of November; in the south three or  four weeks later.    The wild cat resembles the Canada Lynx so closely in habits, etc.,  that I do not consider it necessary to give any special methods for  capturing it. The bait methods recommended for the lynx will also do  very well for the wild cat, and the same bait may be used. In the  south it would probably be better to set in natural enclosures  whenever possible. In the foothills of the Rockies the Bay Lynx is  frequently caught in traps set for coyotes, although they may be  captured as easily there as in any other section, and if the trapper  wishes, he can set his traps in hollows in the rocks, or in  enclosures of brush, cactus, etc.    Some trappers prefer to hang the bait above the trap, and it is a  good way, but I think that the enclosure is more certain.    I would recommend the Nos. 2 and 3 traps for these animals. Although  they may be held at times in smaller traps, any trap having less  strength than the No. 2 should not be depended on.    The track of the wild cat resembles that of the lynx, but is much  smaller. The footprints will seldom measure more than one and a half  inches in diameter, and the step is a trifle shorter than that of the  Canadian Lynx.      [Illustration: The Cougar.]        CHAPTER XVIII.    THE COUGAR.    With the exception of the Jaguar, which will average a trifle larger,  the cougar is the largest representative of the cat tribe to be found  in America.    This animal is known locally under various names. In the mountainous  districts of the Eastern States, where they were once found in fair  numbers, they were known as the panther or \"painter\" from a fancied  resemblance to the panther of tropical Asia. In the far West they are  most commonly known as the mountain lion, and in other localities as  the cougar, while in the Southwest they are sometimes called the  Mexican lion. Throughout the whole of South America they are known as  the puma.    This animal has probably become extinct in the Eastern States, but  they are still found in the South, from Florida, westward throughout  the wild, swampy sections of the Gulf States, into the lowlands of  Texas, and southward. In the West they are found in all of the  mountainous portions from northern British Columbia southward, and in  South America are to be found as far south as southern Patagonia.  They have at all times been more abundant in the West than in the  East and are still plentiful in portions of British Columbia, Idaho,  Wyoming, and Colorado; also in the Pacific Coast States, especially  in northern California.    In size, the average, full grown cougar will perhaps measure seven  feet in length from the nose to the tip of the tail, certainly not  more, and large specimens will weigh from a hundred and fifty to a  hundred and seventy-five pounds. Occasionally larger specimens are  found, but they are exceptional. The tail will measure from two and a  half to three feet.    The color of the cougar is usually of a yellowish brown on the sides,  a trifle darker on the back and white on the throat and underparts.  The tip of the tail is dark, almost black in some specimens. This is  the prevailing color but some will have a grayish cast. While there  is very little difference in the specimens from the various sections,  some naturalists claim that the cougar of Florida and other parts of  the South is a distinct variety.    Cougars prey largely on deer, also in some sections on the wild sheep  and goats. They also kill small animals, and when pressed by hunger  they will not hesitate to attack larger animals than the deer; even  the moose is sometimes killed by the cougar. They are very  destructive to stock in many parts of the West, particularly to  horses, and many of the Western States, as well as the stockmen pay  bounty on cougars. In South America they kill large numbers of wild  cattle.    Their method of securing game is by creeping cautiously to within  springing distance, or by watching a runway from the branches of a  tree, or a ledge of rock from which position they spring upon the  unsuspecting victim, breaking its neck by a twist of the head. When  they can get plenty of food they only suck the blood of the captured  animal, and do not return to the carcass, When food is scarce they  make a meal of the flesh and cover the remains. In such cases they  may return for a second meal.    It was only after the panther became rare in the Eastern States that  the fabulous tales of their daring, and their inclination to attack  human beings, originated, and such stories are never credited by  those who are acquainted with the nature and habits of the animal.  While it would be an easy matter for the cougar to kill an unarmed  man, they are by nature, timid animals, and not to be feared by  human beings. While individual animals may attack man on rare  instances, such occurrences are very rare, and it is safe to say  that nine-tenths of the \"panther stories\" have no foundation  whatever. The western mountain men consider them very cowardly  animals.    In the mountainous districts the cougars live in natural dens, or  caves in the rocks, in places that are almost inaccessible to other  animals. In the swamps of the South they make their home in dense and  almost impenetrable thickets and canebrakes, where they make a nest  of sticks, grass, moss and leaves.    The young animals are born in early spring, there being from two to  four at a birth, but as a rule, only two. The mother animal displays  considerable anxiety for the safety and comfort of her kittens.    There is no method known by which the cougar may be successfully  trapped. Owing to their rambling habits one never knows where to  place a trap for them, and as they prefer to kill their own game,  they will seldom touch bait. As a rule they do not return to the  carcass of their victim, but if one can find an animal freshly  killed, it is a good plan to set a trap by the side of the remains,  and in case the animal should return for a second meal, its capture  is likely. Practically all of those which are trapped are taken in  this way. The No. 4 Newhouse trap is used but the No. 4 1/2 is  better, for being a larger and stronger trap it is more certain to  hold the animal. The trap should be fastened to a heavy clog, and the  trap and clog carefully concealed, for the cougar is wary and  suspicious.    On rare instances when the trapper has been certain that there were  cougars in the near vicinity, they have been captured by setting a  trap in a natural enclosure, placing a fresh, bloody bait behind the  trap, also by hanging the bait about five feet above a carefully  concealed trap.    They are most commonly hunted by the aid of dogs, and in this way the  capture is a comparatively easy matter. When pursued they usually  take to a tree and remain there until the arrival of the hunter when  a rifle bullet ends the game. The animal will take to a tree readily  for any dog which has the courage to follow it.    The skin of the mountain lion is not valuable as a fur, and is used  principally for rugs, but as before mentioned many of the states pay  bounties on the animals, so that hunting them may be made a  profitable business in certain localities.    The tracks of this animal resemble those of the wild cat but are much  larger. The footprints will measure about four inches in diameter.      [Illustration: The Wolverine.]        CHAPTER XIX.    THE WOLVERINE.    Perhaps the most rare of all fur bearing animals, as well as the  least known, is the wolverine. This animal belongs to the marten  family and is the largest, strongest and most cunning of the genus;  in fact, is claimed to be the most cunning and wary of all the  furbearing animals, and among the trappers has an unenviable  reputation.    It is strictly a northern animal and is found scattered over the  greater portion of Canada and Alaska, ranging southward into the most  northern portion of the United States. In the Rocky mountain region  it is found as far south as Wyoming. They are not plentiful anywhere  and are probably found in the greatest numbers in the Alaskan  interior, Yukon, Mackenzie and northern British Columbia.    While the wolverine is classed among the martens it appears to be the  connecting link between the martens and the bears for it is stoutly  built and very bear-like in general appearance, also is a plantigrade  animal, walking on the entire sole of the foot. An average specimen  will measure about thirty inches from the end of the nose to the base  of the tail. The tail is about ten inches in length, exclusive of the  long hair and is very stumpy and bushy. The fur is long and flowing  and is fairly fine. The general color is a dull brown with black legs  and feet and a black patch about the eyes. A spot or stripe of  lighter color sweeps along the sides. The teeth are large and strong  and the curved claws are white, contrasting sharply with the black  fur of the feet and legs.    The wolverine makes its home in a burrow. As to the breeding habits  of the animal, my observations have been limited and I can give no  authentic information. Naturalists disagree as to the number of young  and the time of birth. Some claim that the young animals are born in  May, others put the time as late as December. As the other members of  the marten family give birth to their young in April and May, I think  it safe to assume that the young of the wolverine are born about the  same time, and that the number would be from three to five in a  litter.    The animal is a great traveler, straying sometimes thirty miles in  each direction from its home. It is not a rapid traveler, however,  and it is claimed that a man can easily outrun it.    The wolverine is also known "]]]
