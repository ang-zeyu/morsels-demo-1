Not only was Lyly the proprietor of the theatre, but he  attempted to supply it with the necessary plays. He had already shown  his power to tell in effective prose a pleasing love romance. That  power he now turned to the production of his first play, written in  haste for the Christmas festivities. The play, _Alexander and  Campaspe_, was presented before Her Majesty on January 1, 1584, and at  Blackfriars, with great applause. Lyly's second play, _Sapho and  Phao_, was produced at Court on March 3, following, and also at  Blackfriars before the general public.    But at the Easter term, 1584, Sir William More got judgment in his  favor. The widow begged Sir Francis Walsingham to intercede in her  behalf, declaring that the loss of the lease \"might be her utter  undoing.\"[161] Walsingham sent the letter to More, and apparently  urged a consideration of her case. More, however, refused to yield. He  banished Lyly, Hunnis, Evans, and the Children from the \"great upper  hall,\" and reconverted the building into tenements.    [Footnote 161: The letter is printed in full by Mr. Wallace in _The  Evolution of the English Drama_, p. 158. Mr. Wallace, however,  misdates it. It was not written until after More had \"recovered it  [the lease] against Evans.\"]          CHAPTER VI    ST. PAUL'S      As shown in the preceding chapter, not only were the Children of the  Chapel Royal and of Windsor called upon to entertain the Queen with  dramatic performances, but the Children of St. Paul's were also  expected to amuse their sovereign on occasion. And following the  example of the Children of the Chapel and of Windsor in giving  performances before the public in Blackfriars, the Paul's Boys soon  began to give such performances in a building near the Cathedral.[162]  The building so employed was doubtless one of the structures owned by  the Church. Burbage and Heminges refer to it as \"the said house near  St. Paul's Church.\"[163] Richard Flecknoe, in _A Discourse of the  English Stage_ (1664), places it \"behind the Convocation-house in  Paul's\";[164] and Howes, in his continuation of Stow's _Annals_  (1631), says that it was the \"singing-school\" of the Cathedral.[165]  That the auditorium was small we may well believe. So was the stage.  Certain speakers in the Induction to _What You Will_, acted at Paul's  in 1600, say: \"Let's place ourselves within the curtains, for, good  faith, the stage is so very little, we shall wrong the general eye  else very much.\" Both Fleay and Lawrence[166] contend that the  building was \"round, like the Globe,\" and as evidence they cite the  Prologue to Marston's _Antonio's Revenge_, acted at Paul's in 1600, in  which the phrases \"within this round\" and \"within this ring\" are  applied to the theatre. The phrases, however, may have reference  merely to the circular disposition of the benches about the stage.  That high prices of admission to the little theatre were charged we  learn from a marginal note in _Pappe with an Hatchet_ (1589), which  states that if a tragedy \"be showed at Paul's, it will cost you four  pence; at the Theatre two pence.\"[167] The Children, indeed, catered  to a very select public. Persons who went thither were gentle by birth  and by behavior as well; and playwrights, we are told, could always  feel sure there of the \"calm attention of a choice audience.\"[168]  Lyly, in the Prologue to _Midas_, acted at Paul's in 1589, says: \"Only  this doth encourage us, that presenting our studies before  _Gentlemen_, though they receive an inward dislike, we shall not be  hissed with an open disgrace.\" Things were quite otherwise in the  public theatres of Shoreditch and the Bankside.    [Footnote 162: Murray, _English Dramatic Companies_, I, 325,  erroneously says: \"Their public place was, probably, from the first,  the courtyard of St. Paul's Cathedral.\"]    [Footnote 163: Wallace, _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, p.  95.]    [Footnote 164: That is, in or near Pater Noster Row.]    [Footnote 165: _Annales, or A Generall Chronicle of England_, 1631,  signature liii 1, verso.]    [Footnote 166: F.G. Fleay, _A Biographical Chronicle of the English  Drama_, II, 76; W.J. Lawrence, _The Elizabethan Playhouse_, p. 17.]    [Footnote 167: R.W. Bond, _The Complete Works of John Lyly_, III, 408.  Higher prices of admission were charged to all the private  playhouses.]    [Footnote 168: John Marston, _Antonio's Revenge_, acted at Paul's in  1600.]    Under the direction of their master, Sebastian Westcott, the Boys  acted before the public at least as early as 1578,[169] for in  December of that year the Privy Council ordered the Lord Mayor to  permit them to \"exercise plays\" within the city;[170] and Stephen  Gosson, in his _Plays Confuted_, written soon afterwards, mentions  _Cupid and Psyche_ as having been recently \"plaid at Paules.\"    [Footnote 169: There is a record of a play by the Paul's Boys in 1527  before ambassadors from France, dealing with the heretic Luther; but  exactly when they began to give public performances for money we do  not know.]    [Footnote 170: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 432.]    Westcott died in 1582, and was succeeded by Thomas Gyles. Shortly  after this we find the Children of Paul's acting publicly with the  Children of the Chapel Royal at the little theatre in Blackfriars. For  them John Lyly wrote his two earliest plays, _Campaspe_ and _Sapho and  Phao_, as the title-pages clearly state. But their stay at Blackfriars  was short. When in 1584 Sir William More closed up the theatre there,  they fell back upon their singing-school as the place for their public  performances.    At the same time the Queen became greatly interested in promoting  their dramatic activities. To their master, Thomas Gyles, she issued,  in April, 1585, a special commission \"to take up apt and meet  children\" wherever he could find them. It was customary for the Queen  to issue such a commission to the masters of her two private chapels,  but never before, or afterwards, had this power to impress children  been conferred upon a person not directly connected with the royal  choristers. Its issuance to Gyles in 1585 clearly indicates the  Queen's interest in the Paul's Boys as actors, and her expectation of  being frequently entertained by them. And to promote her plans still  further, she appointed the successful playwright John Lyly as their  vice-master, with the understanding, no doubt, that he was to keep  them--and her--supplied with plays. This he did, for all his comedies,  except the two just mentioned, were written for the Cathedral  Children, and were acted by them at Court, and in their little theatre  \"behind the Convocation House.\"    Unfortunately under Lyly's leadership the Boys became involved in the  bitter Martin Marprelate controversy, for which they were suppressed  near the end of 1590. The printer of Lyly's _Endimion_, in 1591, says  to the reader: \"Since the plays in Paul's were dissolved, there are  certain comedies come to my hands by chance, which were presented  before Her Majesty at several times by the Children of Paul's.\"    Exactly how long the Children were restrained it is hard to determine.  In 1596 Thomas Nash, in _Have With You to Saffron Walden_, expressed  a desire to see \"the plays at Paul's up again.\" Mr. Wallace thinks  they may have been allowed \"up again\" in 1598;[171] Fleay, in 1599 or  1600;[172] the evidence, however, points, I think, to the spring or  early summer of 1600. The Children began, naturally, with old plays,  \"musty fopperies of antiquity\"; the first, or one of the first, new  plays they presented was Marston's _Jack Drum's Entertainment_, the  date of which can be determined within narrow limits. References to  Kempe's Morris, which was danced in February, 1600, as being still a  common topic of conversation, and the entry of the play in the  Stationers' Registers on September 8, 1600, point to the spring or  early summer of 1600 as the date of composition. This makes very  significant the following passage in the play referring to the Paul's  Boys as just beginning to act again after their long inhibition:         _Sir Ed._ I saw the Children of Paul's last night,       And troth they pleas'd me pretty, pretty well.       The Apes in time will do it handsomely.         _Plan._ S'faith, I like the audience that frequenteth there       With much applause. A man shall not be choak't       With the stench of garlic, nor be pasted       To the barmy jacket of a beer-brewer.         _Bra. Ju._ 'Tis a good, gentle audience; and I hope the Boys       Will come one day into the Court of Requests.    [Footnote 171: _The Children of the Chapel_, p. 153.]    [Footnote 172: _A Chronicle History of the London Stage_, p. 152.]    Shortly after this the Boys were indeed called \"into the Court of  Requests,\" for on New Year's Day, 1601, they were summoned to present  a play before Her Majesty.    Their master now was Edward Pierce, who had succeeded Thomas Gyles. In  1605 the experienced Edward Kirkham, driven from the management of the  Blackfriars Theatre, became an assistant to Pierce in the management  of Paul's. In this capacity we find him in 1606 receiving the payment  for the two performances of the Boys at Court that year.[173]    [Footnote 173: Cunningham, _Extracts from the Accounts of the Revels_,  p. XXXVIII.]    Among the playwrights engaged by Pierce to write for Paul's were  Marston, Middleton, Chapman, Dekker, Webster, and Beaumont; and, as a  result, some of the most interesting dramas of the period were first  acted on the small stage of the singing-school. Details in the history  of the Children, however, are few. We find an occasional notice of  their appearance at Court, but our record of them is mainly secured  from the title-pages of their plays.    The last notice of a performance by them is as follows: \"On the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22409"],[0,"A Woman who went to Alaska (#18)"],[1,"wife, daughter or  sweetheart far away. We were the only women in the mines for miles  around, but felt no fear whatever, and indeed we were as safe there as  at home, and there was no occasion for anxiety.    Life was extremely interesting. Our work was not hard the first few  weeks; after that the force of men was increased. Rich pans of dirt (two  shovels full to a pan) were daily being brought to light. One pan  contained seventy-two dollars and seventy-five cents, one eighty-three  dollars and thirty-five cents. Big, fat nuggets already melted into  wondrous shapes, but iron rusted, as all Anvil Creek gold is, for some  reason, was discovered each day. One nugget tipped the scales at  thirty-nine dollars, one at twenty dollars, and one at fifty dollars,  with many others of like value.    Wednesday, August eighth, the following entry was made in my diary:  \"Today has been the banner day for gold dust. The night's cleanup of  twelve hours' work was a big one--three pans full of gold. Later--Still  more yet. A cleanup of nine thousand dollars and three of the largest  nuggets I ever saw has just been made this evening. Two of the nuggets  were long and flat, as large as a tree-toad, and much the shape of one.  The men took the first load of gold dust to town--seventy-five  pounds--but the bank was closed before they could get the remainder  there. The foreman says they are prepared to keep it here safely over  night, however, and I believe they are, judging by the big protuberances  on their hip pockets.\"          CHAPTER XI.    LIFE IN A MINING CAMP.      As the rains came to facilitate the sluicing, more men were added to the  force shovelling in the creeks, and this made our work heavier. An  exceedingly cranky foreigner, as head cook, presided over the big coal  range in the mess-house, and we women \"played second fiddle,\" so to  speak. However, we all had enough hard work, as a midnight supper for  the second force had to be prepared and regularly served, and at this we  labored alternately.    Strange to relate, the men at the long tables soon began to exhibit a  very great partiality for the dishes prepared by the English girl and  myself, to the end that the foreign fellow's black eyes snapped with  anger, and he swore deeply under his breath.    \"He vill eat vat I gif heem. He moose eat it ven he hoongry, else he  starve himsel'. I care not he no like it, he get nothing other!\" the  angry man would exclaim, as the untouched plates of the men were scraped  into the waste box. He would then, fearing that we would cook some dish  more palatable to the miners, hide the best food, or forbid us to use  certain ingredients as we wished.    Of the culinary stores provided there never could be a complaint.  Everything that money could buy in the way of fresh meat, potatoes,  onions, canned and dried fruits and vegetables, flour, corn and  oatmeals, were stacked up in the greatest profusion. From canned  oysters, clams and French sardines, to fine cocoa and cream, all was  here found in quantities, after being hauled in a wagon behind powerful  horses over the seven miles of heavy roads from Nome. By the time the  goods reached camp they were almost worth their weight in gold, but one  might have supposed them dirt cheap, for we, as hungry miners and cooks,  were never limited.    Week after week the patient animals and their driver were kept measuring  the distance between the city and the claim, even though the wet tundra  in low places grew sodden and boggy, and the wheels repeatedly sank to  the hubs. At times more horses were attached to haul them out of some  hole, or if these were not at hand, certain heavy cases were dumped off  until the reeking, straining brutes had successfully extricated the  load. Covered with mud and sweat, his high-topped rubber boots each  weighing a number of pounds, and his stomach too empty to allow of  conversation, after a long, hard day's work, the driver of this team  would fling himself upon one of the benches alongside our table and  say:    \"Yes, I'm ready to eat anything. Been caved in for two hours.\"    This young man, as well as the night foreman, was a cousin of Mr. A.,  both farmer boys, honest, kind and true. No oaths fell from their lips,  and no language was used which their own mothers would ever blush to  hear.    The second of these, the foreman, was dressed also in great rubber  boots, dark blue sweater, and broad-brimmed felt hat, with a quick eye  and ear for all around him, though he was a man of few words, which he  weighed well before using. His hip pocket always contained a loaded  revolver, and he was obliged to sleep days after being on duty nights.    To eyes so unaccustomed as ours to the sight, how strange it all looked  at midnight. From the big tent door which faced south and towards Nome  City we could see the blue waters of Behring Sea away in the distance.  Great ships lying there at anchor, lately arrived from the outside world  or just about to leave, laden with treasure, at this long range looked  like mere dots on the horizon. Between them and us there straggled over  the beach in a westerly direction, a confused group of objects we well  knew to be the famous and fast growing camp on the yellow sands. To our  right, as well as our left, rolled the softly undulating hills, glowing  in tender tints of purples and greys, or, if the moon hung low above our  heads, there were warmer and lighter shades which were doubly  entrancing.    Accompanying the low moon twinkled the silver stars with their olden  time coyness of expression. Little birds, not knowing when to sleep in  the endless daylight, hopped among the dewy wild flowers of the tundra,  calling to their mates or nestlings, twittering a song appropriate to  the time and place because entirely unfamiliar.    No other sound was to be heard except the picks of the miners at work in  the stream. No word was spoken unless the foreman gave some order. Those  sleeping in nearby tents must not be wakened, and besides the men at the  shovels and picks did no loitering. There were the long sluice boxes to  be filled with what was once the creek bed, from which the water was now  turned in another direction to await the morning's cleanup of gold.    At that time the water would be conducted into the long boxes to wash  away the dirt and gravel, leaving the heavier gold in the bottom. Either  Mr. A. or his brother, with the foreman, attended to cleaning up the  gold. When all the dirt and gravel, or rock, had been washed out of the  sluices, a whisk broom was used to brush the gold into a corner of the  box, a dustpan conveyed it to broad-mouthed gold pans close at hand, and  these were carried into the kitchen.    Here the pans were placed upon the iron range, big mush spoons were  utilized for stirring, and the precious metal was well dried before  being weighed. As soon as possible afterward it was taken to the Bank of  Nome. A tall, black horse was purchased for this purpose alone, and  after a few such trips the intelligent creature most reluctantly  approached the office where the gold was kept, having learned of the  grievous burden he would have to bear. Sometimes he would snort, throw  himself and pull back, and in every way show his unwillingness to  proceed.    But no shirk was allowed here. The horse was led close to the steps of  the office tent, and a gunny sack tied in the middle brought out by two  men and laid over the back of the unwilling beast. A rain coat or  blanket was flung over the sack, and the man at the halter started for  town, leading the horse, which walked slowly and resignedly after being  compelled to go.    A second man, well armed with revolvers like the first, always  accompanied the pair, and when the three had returned to the claim  another cleanup awaited them. Enormous sums of money were taken from  this claim while we were there, averaging ten thousand to twenty  thousand dollars per day. Seventy men worked for a time when the water  was at its best, part of that number on the day force and part at night.    In August the west bank of the creek was accidentally pricked and found  to be far richer than the bed of the stream. Nuggets worth many dollars  were continually unearthed, the largest one that summer amounting to  ninety dollars. The richest pans contained sixty-four dollars,  seventy-two dollars and seventy-five cents and eighty-four dollars, with  others ranging all the way below.    From a bench claim next to Number Eleven on this creek, and only  one-fourth of a mile above us, great heaps of gold were taken from the  ground, no pan carrying less, it was said, than five hundred dollars.    From seventy men to wait upon when the stream was at high water mark, to  twenty-five when it was lower, at any time our lot was hard. We worked  with chapped, bleeding hands and aching backs. We worked until our tired  limbs sometimes refused to carry us further. By the middle of August the  nights began to grow dark at nine o'clock, and a hold-up or two took  place on the creek. The weather was rainy and cold, with frosty nights  between, and as we were all in tents, and these sometimes leaked, which  did not improve the head cook's temper and he grew almost abusive; we  retired, went to town, and left him alone to meditate. Here he hastily  and angrily for a few days longer tossed up nondescript messes for the  men, which none could eat, and was then discharged in disgrace.    In all there were fifteen placer claims staked on Anvil. Some of these  were scarcely touched that summer, but from those operated fully two  million five hundred thousand dollars were taken in three months.    [Illustration: CLAIM NUMBER NINE, ANVIL CREEK.]    During the six weeks we had spent at Number Nine, many improvements had  been made along the route and in Nome. Where before we had traveled  seven miles we now walked only two, riding on the new narrow gauge  railroad, "]]]
