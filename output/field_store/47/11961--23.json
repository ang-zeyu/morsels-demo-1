It falleth, still it falleth,      A deluge o'er the rocks;      It calleth, still it calleth,      With tones likes earthquake shocks:      For ever and for ever,      It sounds its mighty hymn;      Like a thousand anthems pealing      In some cathedral dim.        The dark pines shrink and tremble      As o'er the abyss they lean,      And falling are ingulf'd like reeds      With all their branches green;      And oaks from northern mountains,      O'erwhelm'd by some fierce blast,      Are rent like autumn flowerets,      In that vast caldron cast.        A thousand years ago the tribes      In wonder trod its side:      Those tribes have vanish'd, but the Fall      Still pours as full a tide;      A thousand more may pass away--      A future race of men      May view the awful cataract      Unchang'd dash down its glen.        How passing vain doth mortal pride      Beside this torrent seem!      An army doth not march to war      With half its sound and gleam;      While o'er it, like a banner,      The rainbow spreads its fold,      Colored with prismy glories      Of purple and of gold.        The wild deer of the forest      At the river stoop to drink,      But from the rush of waters      All panic-stricken shrink;      And the mountain eagles sailing      O'er the cataract's foaming brim      Alarmed, on soaring pinions,      Away, o'er Heaven's clouds skim.        O! who that views the wonders      Of Nature o'er the earth;      The high o'erhanging mountains      Where thunders have their birth:      And this eternal torrent,      Majestically grand--      Can doubt the Spirit's presence,      And a Creating Hand?    On the following day the Oneidas resumed their march, and at nightfall  reached an American military post, then just established at the entrance  of the Niagara river, on the shore of Lake Ontario, called the Fort  Niagara. The Oneidas entered within the barriers of the little stockade  fortress, and there established their camp, and were soon busily engaged  in arranging a treaty with the commandant of the place. Wauchee followed  closely after, like a bloodhound on the trail, and selected his camp in  a little grove just without the gates of the fortress. He then boldly  sauntered within the walls, and mingled with cool indifference among the  groups of soldiery, and the armed warriors of his foe. But under the  semblance of friendship, lurked the fire of a spirit burning with  hatred; and he could scarce restrain himself from plunging among them,  and immolating numbers on the spot. Still the wary prudence of the  savage restrained his hand, and he continued for a day or two to mingle  in peace among them. The crafty Oneidas soon suspected the designs of  the stranger, and they conferred among themselves, as to the surest mode  of guarding against the meditated blow of Wauchee. They well recognized  by his paint and garb the Mohawk warrior, and they resolved to baffle  his assault, and for ever prevent his return to the people of his tribe.    But the designs of a bold and resolute man are not easily fathomed or  thwarted, and the rude walls of the frontier fortress were unable to  shut out so brave and active a warrior as the Mohawk chief. He was  trained to stratagem, and sworn to vengeance; and now that his wild  blood boiled with fury, no ramparts of mere wood and stone could  effectually interpose between the avenger and the destroyers of his  sire.    During the silence and gloom of night he succeeded in scaling the  palings of the walls, and secretly and successfully made his way into  the very heart of the fortress. He was surrounded with numbers of armed  men slumbering upon their weapons; and many a pacing sentinel was  stationed upon the breast-works, to guard against an open or a secret  foe: yet the soft step and the gliding figure of the Mohawk passed along  in the darkness unheard and undetected. After moving about swiftly among  the sleepers for some time, he at length came upon the prostrate group  of the Oneidas. Trusting to the vigilance of the garrison, the savages  were all buried in slumber, and were outspread along the grassy floor,  enwrapped in their blankets. The wily Mohawk went in like a serpent  among them, and having recognized their sleeping chief by the eagle  plume upon his head, he drew his scalp-knife, and with one mortal blow  drove the weapon to the very heart of the dreamer. He then in an instant  severed the bleeding scalp from the head, and sprang away to make good  his escape, but was followed as instantly by a dozen dark forms, which  bounded after him like so many leaping panthers. Still the daring young  brave would have successfully effected his escape but for an unfortunate  accident. With one quick bound he overleaped the barriers of the fort,  but in alighting heavily on the sod he severely sprained his ankle,  which so disabled him, that he fell an easy prey into the hands of his  pursuers. He was instantly firmly bound with cords, and dragged back,  amidst savage jeers and menaces, into the fortress.    On the following day the luckless captive was led away by his enemies to  their neighboring village, which was situated at Messessaga Point, near  the fortress. The warriors sadly bore, on a litter of branches, the body  of their slain chieftain, leading beside it their pinioned captive. As  they approached to the little rude hamlet where they dwelt, a motley  crowd of old men, women, and children, came forth to welcome their  return; but when they beheld the ghastly body of their late chief, and  the drooping looks of the warriors, their joyful cries were exchanged  for wails of lamentation, and they tore their hair, and expressed the  most violent emotions of grief. They wept over the bleeding corpse of  the victim, while they derided and buffeted the helpless prisoner. But  the stout-hearted Wauchee moved onwards with a firm and erect gait,  disturbed neither by the blows nor the menaces that were directed  against him. He only exclaimed, \"You have slain my chief and father, and  lo! I have also struck down the head of your nation. It is well. Slay  me--torture me, if you will. I can bear unmoved any torments you may  inflict.\"    The captive, still bound securely with thongs of deer-hide, was thrust  into a cabin; and two stout warriors were appointed to watch over him by  day and night, and were charged to use the utmost vigilance in  preventing his escape. A few dried bunches of fern were spread for his  couch; and he was supplied with a wooden bowl of water and a handful of  pounded corn to satisfy his appetite; and it was ordered that Monega,  the most skilful mediciner of the tribe, should apply her most healing  salves and balsams to his hurts, that he might the sooner be ready to  run the gauntlet, and endure the torture of fire, which was the destiny  awaiting him.    Monega was the daughter of a chief, and as it chanced, was as  distinguished for the gentleness of her heart, as for her exceeding  loveliness, and her great medical skill. No one could look upon her  slight and well-rounded limbs, and upon her sweet countenance, without a  feeling of admiration, if not of love; and no sooner did our Mohawk gaze  upon her features, and listen to the soft tones of her voice, than he  was completely fascinated with her charms. Nor did the Indian damsel  gaze upon the noble captive with less favorable emotions. With a  blushing cheek and trembling hand she produced from a number of gourds,  the most potent herbs that constituted her remedies, and tenderly  applied them to the wounded limbs of the Mohawk.    \"How is the sweet daughter of the Oneida named?\" inquired the young  chief, as the damsel proceeded to bathe the bruised places with  sweet-smelling medicines.    A blush suffused the modest cheek of Monega as she replied, \"I am called  among my people Monega, or the Wild-rose, and am the daughter of a  chief.\"    \"Monega,\" exclaimed he, \"is fairer than any honeyed wild-rose that is  kissed by the red lip of the morning, or than the pearly lily that  droops by the brink of the running water. There is no maiden among the  fair daughters of the Mohawk, so lovely in the eyes of Wauchee. Will not  the Wild-rose return again the fondness that blooms in the breast of the  strange warrior, though he lies like a wounded panther at the feet of  his mistress?\"    \"The captive warrior,\" returned the maiden, \"has a bold heart, and is  more stately and noble than any of the young chiefs of her own people,  yet Monega must not yield her heart to a chief of an enemy.\" And, so  saying, she hastily gathered her herbs and unguents together, and  withdrew beneath the suspended buffalo-hide that formed the door of the  wigwam.    As the shades of evening began to settle on the deep woods that drooped  around, the captive continued to listen intently for the returning step  of the damsel; and presently the heavy drapery at the entrance was drawn  aside, and the yellow flood of the setting sun streamed upon the figure  of Monega. \"The hours of the day,\" said the youth, \"have been dark and  weary to the heart of the captive, since the Wild-rose withdrew from the  side of Wauchee, but now that she has returned, the light again shines  in his heart, and his soul is filled with brightness and joy.\"    The maiden in silence produced her herbs and bandages, and after  applying them to his hurts, thus replied to his words: \"Wauchee is  noble, and brave, but his days are now few and numbered. Let us speak  with a low voice, for the two warriors are watchful at the door, and  their jealous ears may catch the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31219"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#18)"],[1,"' dey doan bother nothin' in our  community but de white folkses hates 'em jist de same.    \"Marster Jerry tells us 'bout a week later dat we am free an' all of de  two hundret 'cept 'bout five er six goes right off.
