[63] _Sifacio_, famous beyond any, for the most singular Beauty of his  Voice. His Manner of Singing was remarkably plain, consisting  particularly in the _Messa di Voce_, the putting forth his Voice, and  the Expression.    There is an _Italian_ Saying, that an hundred Perfections are required  in an excellent Singer, and he that hath a fine Voice has ninety-nine of  them.    It is also certain, that as much as is allotted to Volubility and  Tricks, so much is the Beauty of the Voice sacrificed; for the one  cannot be done without Prejudice to the other.    _Sifacio_ got that Name from his acting the Part of _Syphax_ the first  time he appeared on the Stage. He was in _England_ when famous, and  belonged to King _James_ the Second's Chapel. After which he returned to  _Italy_, continuing to be very much admired, but at last was waylaid,  and murthered for his Indiscretion.    [64] _Buzzolini_, the Name known, but no Particulars of him.    [65] _Litigino_, in the Service of the Emperor _Joseph_, and a Scholar  of _Pistochi_.    [66] _Signora Boschi_ was over in _England_ in Queen _Anne's_ Time; she  sung one Season in the Opera's, returned to _Venice_, and left her  Husband behind for several Years; he sung the Bass. She was a Mistress  of Musick, but her Voice was on the Decay when she came here.    [67] _Santini_, afterwards _Signora Lotti_. She was famous above forty  Years ago, and appeared at several Courts in _Germany_, where she was  sent for; then retired to _Venice_, where she married _Signor Lotti_,  Chapel-Master of St. _Mark_.    All these Singers, though they had a Talent particular to themselves,  they could, however, sing in several sorts of Stile; on the contrary,  one finds few, but what attempt nothing that is out of their Way. A  modern Singer of the good Stile, being asked, whether such and such  Compositions would not please at present in _Italy_? No doubt, said he,  they would, but where are the Singers that can sing them?    [68] Those tremendous _Airs_ are called in _Italian_, _un Aria di  Bravura_; which cannot perhaps be better translated into _English_, than  a _Hectoring_ Song.    [69] _Pierre Simone Agostini_ lived about threescore Years ago. Several  _Cantata's_ of his Composition are extant, some of them very difficult,  not from the Number of _Divisions_ in the vocal Part, but from the  Expression, and the surprising Incidents, and also the Execution of the  Basses. He seems to be the first that put Basses with so much Vivacity;  for _Charissimi_ before him composed with more Simplicity, tho' he is  reckoned to be one of the first, who enlivened his Musick in the  Movements of his Basses. Of _Pierre-Simone_ nothing more is known but  that he loved his Bottle, and when he had run up a Bill in some  favourite Place, he composed a _Cantata_, and sent it to a certain  Cardinal, who never failed sending him a fixed Sum, with which he paid  off his Score.    [70] _Alessandro Stradella_ lived about _Pier. Simone's_ Time, or very  little after. He was a most excellent Composer, superior in all Respects  to the foregoing, and endowed with distinguishing personal  Qualifications. It is reported, that his favourite Instrument was the  Harp, with which he sometimes accompanied his Voice, which was  agreeable. To hear such a Composer play on the Harp, must have been what  we can have no Notion of, by what we now hear. He ended his Life  fatally, for he was murthered. The Fact is thus related. Being at  _Genoa_, a Place where the Ladies are allowed to live with more Freedom  than in any other Part of _Italy_, _Stradella_ had the honour of being  admitted into a noble Family, the Lady whereof was a great Lover of  Musick. Her Brother, a wrong-headed Man, takes Umbrage at _Stradella's_  frequent Visits there, and forbids him going upon his Peril, which Order  _Stradella_ obeys. The Lady's Husband not having seen _Stradella_ at his  House for some Days, reproaches him with it. _Stradella_, for his  Excuse, tells him his Brother-in-Law's Order, which the Nobleman is  angry with, and charges him to continue his Visits as formerly; he had  been there scarce three or four Times, but one Evening going Home,  attended by a Servant and a Lanthorn, four Ruffians rushed out, the  Lady's Brother one among them, and with _Stiletts_ or Daggers stabb'd  him, and left him dead upon the Place. The people of _Genoa_ all in a  Rage fought for the Murtherer, who was forced to fly, his Quality not  being able to protect him. In another Account of him, this Particularity  is mentioned; that the Murderers pursued him to _Rome_, and on Enquiry  learned, that an _Oratorio_ of his Composition was to be performed that  Evening; they went with an Intent to execute their Design, but were so  moved with his Composition, that they rather chose to tell him his  Danger, advised him to depart, and be upon his Guard. But, being pursued  by others, he lost his Life. His Fate has been lamented by every Body,  especially by those who knew his Merit, and none have thought him  deserving so sad a Catastrophe.    [71] When _Tosi_ writ this, the Composers in Vogue were _Scarlatti_,  _Bononcini_, _Gasparini_, _Mancini_, &c. The last and modern Stile has  pretty well spread itself all over _Italy_, and begins to have a great  Tendency to the same beyond the _Alps_, as he calls it.    [72] The _Moods_, here spoken of, our Author has not well explained. The  Foundation he goes upon are the eight Church _Moods_. But his Meaning  and Complaint is, that commonly the Compositions are in _C_, or in _A_,  with their Transpositions, and that the others are not used or known.  But to particularise here what the _Moods_ are, and how to be used, is  impossible, for that Branch only would require a large Treatise by  itself.    [73] The _Airs_, sung in Unison with the Instruments, were invented in  the _Venetian_ Opera's, to please the _Barcaroles_, who are their  Watermen: and very often their Applause supports an Opera. The _Roman_  School always distinguished itself, and required Compositions of Study  and Care. How it is now at _Rome_ is doubtful; but we do not hear that  there are any _Corelli's_.    [74] _Maestro di Capella_, Master of the Chapel, the highest Title  belonging to a Master of Musick. Even now the Singers in _Italy_ give  the Composers of Opera's the Title of _Signior Maestro_ as a Mark of  their Submission.    [75] _Contrapunto_, Counterpoint, or Note against Note, the first  Rudiments of Composition.    [76] _Furlana_. A sort of Country Dance, or _Cheshire_-Round.    It is reported, that the Church-Musick in _Italy_, far from keeping that  Majesty it ought, is vastly abused the other way; and some Singers have  had the Impudence to have other Words put to favourite Opera _Airs_ and  sung them in Churches. This Abuse is not new, for St. _Augustine_  complains of it; and _Palestrina_ prevented in his Time Musick from  being banished the Churches.    [77] _Tono_, or _Mood_, and sometimes means the Key. Our Author in this  Section is fond of a Pun, which cannot well be translated. _Tono_ is  sometimes writ _Tuono_ and _Tuono_ signifies Thunder; therefore the  Ignorant answers, he knows no other _Tuono_ but that which is preceded  by Lightning.    [78] _Cadences_; or, principal Closes in _Airs_.    [79] For superior and inferior _Cadences_, see Pl. V. Numb. 3.    [80] Broken _Cadences_, see Example, Chap. V. Sec. 13, and its Note.    [81] _Cadences_ that fall a Fifth, with and without Words, Pl. V, Numb.  4 and 5.    [82] By the _Final Cadences_ here mentioned, the first is at the End of  the first Part of the _Air_; the Second at the End of the second Part:  and the Third at the end of the first Part when repeated again, or at  the _Da Capo_, as it is always expressed in _Italian_.    [83] For the resolved and unresolved _Cadences_, see Pl. V. Numb. 6 and  7.    [84] See for the Examples, Pl. V. Numb. 8.    [85] See Example, Pl. VI. Numb. 1.    [86] See Example, Pl. VI. Numb. 2.    _N.B._ An _Appoggiatura_ cannot be made on an unaccented Syllable.    [87] See for Examples, Pl. VI. Numb. 3.    [88] See for Examples, Pl. VI. Numb. 4.    [89] Some, after a tender and passionate _Air_, make a lively merry  _Cadence_; and, after a brisk _Air_, end it with one that is doleful.    [90] Though this Chapter regards Singers who make it their Profession,  and particularly those who sing on the Stage, yet there are many  excellent Precepts interspersed, that are of Use to Lovers of Musick.    [91] _Kyrie_, the first Word of the Mass-Musick in the Cathedral Stile,  is not so difficult to them as the _Cantata's_; and the _Latin_ in the  Service, being familiar to them, saves them the Trouble of attending to  the Words.    [92] _Thomas Morley_ (who lived above an hundred Years ago) in the third  Part of his Treatise, pag. 179, speaking of _Motetts_ or Anthems,  complains thus:--'But I see not what Passions or Motions it can stir up,  being as most Men doe commonlie Sing,--leaving out the Ditty--as it were  a Musick made onely for Instruments, which will indeed shew the Nature  of the Musick, but never carry the Spirit and (as it were) that lively  Soule which the Ditty giveth; but of this enough. And to return to the  expressing of the Ditty, the Matter is now come to that State, that  though a Song be never so wel made, and never so aptly applyed to the  Words, yet shall you hardly find Singers to expresse it as it ought to  be; for most of our Church-men, (so they crie louder in the Quire then  their Fellowes) care for no more; whereas, by the contrarie, they ought  to study how to vowel and sing clean expressing their Words with  Devotion and Passion, whereby to draw the Hearer as it were in Chaines  of Gold by the Eares to the Consideration of holy Things. But this, for  the most part, you shall find amongst them, that let them continue never  so long in the Church, yea though it were twentie Years,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2649"],[0,"Captains of the Civil War: A Chronicle of the Blue and the Gray (#18)"],[1,"the gunboats would take ten days for  indispensable repairs, Grant resigned himself to the very unwelcome  idea of going through the long-drawn horrors of a regular winter  siege.    But, to his intense surprise, the enemy saved him the trouble. At  first, when they had a slight preponderance of numbers, they stood  fast and let Grant invest them. Now that he had the preponderance  they tried to cut their way out by the southern road, upstream, where  McClernand's division stood guard. As Grant came ashore from his  interview with Foote an aide met him with the news that McClernand  had been badly beaten and that the enemy was breaking out. Grant  set spurs to his horse and galloped the four muddy miles to his  left, where that admirable soldier, C. F. Smith, was as cool and  wary as ever, harassing the enemy's new rear by threatening an  assault, but keeping his division safe for whatever future use  Grant wanted. Wallace had also done the right thing, pressing the  enemy on his own front and sending a brigade to relieve the pressure  on McClernand. These two generals were in conversation during a lull  in the battle when Grant rode up, calmly returned their salutes,  attentively listened to their reports, and then, instead of trying  the Halleckian expedient of digging in farther back before the enemy  could make a second rush, quietly said: \"Gentlemen, the position  on the right must be retaken.\"    Grant knew that Floyd was no soldier and that Pillow was a  stumbling-block. He read the enemy's mind like an open book and  made up his own at once by the flash of intuition which told him  that their men were mostly as much demoralized by finding their  first attempt at escape more than half a failure as even McClernand's  were by being driven back. He decided to use Smith's fresh division  for an assault in rear, while McClernand's, stiffened by Wallace's,  should re-form and hold fast. Before leaving the excited officers and  men, who were talking in groups without thinking of their exhausted  ammunition, he called out cheerily \"Fill your cartridge boxes quick,  and get into line. The enemy is trying to escape and he must not  be permitted to do so.\" McClernand's division, excellent men, but  not yet disciplined soldiers, responded at once to the touch of a  master hand; and as Grant rode off to Smith's he had the satisfaction  of seeing the defenseless groups melt, change, and harden into  well-armed lines.    Smith, ready at all points, had only to slip his own division from  the leash. Buckner, who was to have covered the Confederate escape,  was also ready with the guns of Fort Donelson and the rifles of  defenses that \"looked too thick for a rabbit to get through.\" Smith,  knowing his unseasoned men would need the example of a commander  they could actually see, rode out in front of his center as if  at a formal review. \"I was nearly scared to death,\" said one of  his followers, \"but I saw the old man's white moustache over his  shoulder, and so I went on.\" As the line neared the Confederate  abatis a sudden gust of fire seemed to strike it numb. In an instant  Smith had his cap on the point of his sword. Then, rising in his  stirrups to his full gigantic height, he shouted in stentorian  tones: \"No flinching now, my lads! Here--this way in! Come on!\"  In, through, and out the other side they went, Smith riding ahead,  holding his sword and cap aloft, and seeming to bear a charmed life  amid that hail of bullets. Up the slope he rode, the Confederates  retiring before him, till, unscathed, he reached the deadly crest,  where the Union colors waved defiance and the Union troops stood  fast.    Floyd, being under special indictment at Washington for misconduct  as Secretary of War, was so anxious to escape that he turned over  the command to Pillow, who declined it in favor of Buckner. That  night Floyd and Pillow made off with all the river steamers; Forrest's  cavalry floundered past McClernand's exposed flank, which rested on  a shallow backwater; and Buckner was left with over twelve thousand  men to make what terms he could. Next morning, the sixteenth, he wrote  to Grant proposing the appointment of commissioners to agree upon  terms of surrender. But Grant had made up his mind that compromise  was out of place in civil war and that absolute defeat or victory  were the only alternatives. So he instantly wrote back the famous  letter which quickly earned him the appropriate nickname--suggested  by his own initials--of Unconditional Surrender Grant.                       Hd Qrs., Army in the Field                   Camp near Donelson Feb'y 16th 1882    Gen. S. B. Buckner,    Confed. Army.    Sir: Yours of this date proposing armistice, and appointment of  Commissioners to settle terms of capitulation is just received.  No terms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be  accepted. I propose to move immediately upon your works        I am, Sir, very respectfully,                  Your obt. sert.,                     U. S. GRANT                         Brig. Gen.      Grant and Buckner were old army friends; so their personal talk  was very pleasant at the little tavern where Buckner and his staff  had just breakfasted off corn bread and coffee, which was all the  Confederate stores afforded.    Donelson at once became, like Grant, a name to conjure with. The  fact that the Union had at last won a fight in which the numbers  neared, and the losses much exceeded, those at Bull Run itself, the  further fact that this victory made a fatal breach in the defiant  Southern line beyond the Alleghanies, and the delight of discovering  another, and this time a genuine, hero in \"Unconditional Surrender  Grant,\" all combined to set the loyal North aflame with satisfaction,  pride, and joyful expectation. Great things were expected in Virginia,  where the invasion had not yet begun. Great things were expected  in the Gulf, where Farragut had not yet tried the Mississippi.  And great things were expected to result from Donelson itself,  whence the Union forces were to press on south till they met other  Union forces pressing north. The river campaign was then to end  in a blaze of glory.    Donelson did have important results. Johnston, who had already  abandoned Bowling Green for Nashville, had now to abandon Nashville,  with most of its great and very sorely needed stores, as well as  the rest of Tennessee, and take up a new position along the rails  that ran from Memphis to Chattanooga, whence they forked northeast  to Richmond and Washington and southeast to Charleston and Savannah.  Columbus was also abandoned, and the only points left to the  Confederates anywhere near the old line were Island Number Ten in  the Mississippi and the Boston Mountains in Arkansas.    But the triumphant Union advance from the north did not take place  in '62. Grant was for pushing south as fast as possible to attack the  Confederates before they had time to defend their great railway junction  at Corinth. But Halleck was too cautious; and misunderstandings,  coupled with division of command, did the rest. Halleck was the  senior general in the West. But the three, and afterwards four,  departments into which the West was divided were never properly  brought under a single command. Then telegrams went wrong at the  wire-end advancing southwardly from Cairo, the end Grant had to  use. A wire from McClellan on the sixteenth of February was not  delivered till the third of March. Next day Grant was thunderstruck  at receiving this from Halleck: \"Place C. F. Smith in command of  expedition and remain yourself at Fort Henry. Why do you not obey  my orders to report strength and positions of your command?\" And  so it went on till McClellan authorized Halleck to place Grant  under arrest for insubordination. Then the operator at the wire-end  suddenly deserted, taking a sheaf of dispatches with him. He was  a clever Confederate.    Explanations followed; and on the seventeenth of March Grant rejoined  his army, which was assembling round Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee,  near the future battlefield of Shiloh, and some twenty miles northeast  of Corinth.    Meanwhile Van Dorn and Sterling Price, thinking it was now or never  for Missouri, decided to attack Curtis. They had fifteen against  ten thousand men, and hoped to crush Curtis utterly by catching  him between two fires. But on the seventh of March the Federal left  beat off the flanking attack of McCulloch and McIntosh, both of  whom were killed. The right, furiously assailed by the Confederate  Missourians under Van Dorn and Price, fared badly and was pressed  back. Yet on the eighth Curtis emerged victorious on the hard-fought  field that bears the double name of Elkhorn Tavern and Pea Ridge.  This battle in the northwest corner of Arkansas settled the fate  of Missouri.    A month later the final attack was made on Island Number Ten. Foote's  flotilla had been at work there as early as the middle of March,  when the strong Confederate batteries on the island and east shore  bluffs were bombarded by ironclads and mortarboats. Then the Union  General John Pope took post at New Madrid, eight miles below the  island, on the west shore, which the Confederates had to evacuate  when he cut their line of communications farther south. They now  held only the island and the east shore opposite, with no line  of retreat except the Mississippi, because the land line on the  east shore was blocked by swamps and flanked by the Union armies  in western Tennessee.    On the night of the fourth of April the _Carondelet_ started to  cut this last line south. She was swathed in hawsers and chain  cables. Her decks were packed tight with every sort of gear that  would break the force of plunging shot; and a big barge, laden  with coal and rammed hay, was lashed to her port side to protect  her magazine. Twenty-three picked Illinoisian sharpshooters went  aboard; while pistols,"]]]
