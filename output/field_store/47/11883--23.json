When once the question of reform, or no reform, in the  Transvaal came up, all conciliatory speeches were useless. It made no  difference whether the Transvaal was right or wrong; it was always,  \"_Our_ Transvaal, good or bad.\" In short, all that happened both in  the Transvaal and the Cape Colony during this (South African) spring  and summer was of the nature to impress conclusively upon Lord  Milner's mind that on the crucial issue between the Imperial  Government and the Transvaal, the leaders of Dutch opinion in the Cape  Colony were against the British cause. The rank and file of the Dutch  population, if left to themselves, might be indifferent, possibly  friendly; but the Bond organisation had placed them under the control  of the Bond leaders; and the Bond was hostile. What, more than  anything else, would serve to confirm this impression was Lord  Milner's constant study of the Dutch Press. Among these journals, _Ons  Land_ presented the most authoritative and significant expression of  the Bond policy, as directed by Mr. Hofmeyr's astute brain and  unrivalled experience. The editorial columns of _Ons Land_ rarely  contained a sentence that, standing alone, could be quoted as evidence  of its advocacy of anti-British action. Its method was far more  subtle. In everything in which Great Britain was concerned the  attitude which it adopted was one of profound alienation, rather than  of aggressive hostility. England's position in the world was presented  and discussed as though \"Afrikanders\" were no more interested in it  than they were in that of any foreign country. And, in South African  matters, the tone of the Dutch Press, and of the Bond leaders, was not  merely discouraging; at any hint of possible British action for the  improvement of the administrative conditions of the Transvaal, it took  a note of menace. \"Hands off\" the Transvaal: that was the sum and  substance of Bond policy.    Between the Jubilee despatch and the Graaf Reinet speech, then, the  Transvaal Government had shown that it had set its face definitely  against reform, and Lord Milner had had time to realise the true state  of political feeling in the Colony of which he was Governor. While  there was anger among the British at the hopeless situation in the  Transvaal, among the Dutch was a fixed determination not to allow the  Transvaal to be interfered with. And there was something else that  Lord Milner would have observed during his travels throughout the  Colony. It was the utter despondency of the British population, and  the condition of abasement to which they had been reduced. Nor can he  have failed to observe that everywhere among the British there was a  constant apology for the Raid; while, on the part of the Dutch, there  was no recognition of all that the British had done to wipe out its  stain and to mitigate its effects: in a word, that the moral conquest  of the Colony by the Dutch was practically complete.    [Sidenote: Milner at Graaf Reinet.]    It was with this accumulated evidence in his mind that Lord Milner  travelled down, on March 2nd, 1898, from Capetown to Graaf Reinet,  expecting to take part in a Governor's function of the ordinary sort  at the opening of the railway on the following day. The conventional  expressions of loyalty to the Queen, and the scarcely veiled hypocrisy  and defiance with which the Dutch reiterated them, at the time when  the whole weight of their influence was thrown against Great Britain  on the only South African question that really mattered, had become  nauseating even to his serene temper and generous disposition. He was  wearied, too, of receiving a frivolous or unfriendly reply from the  Pretoria Executive to the most reasonable proposals of the Imperial  Government. Late at night there was brought to him, in the train, a  copy of an address from the Graaf Reinet branch of the Afrikander  Bond, which was to be presented to him on the morrow. It contained, in  more than usually pointed language, a protest against \"the charges of  disloyalty made against the Bond,\" and a request that the High  Commissioner would \"convey to the Queen the expression of its  unswerving loyalty.\" As he read on we can imagine how, in ominous  contrast to the superficial protestations of the text, something  exceptionally aggressive in the tone of the address, something which  emphasised the inconsistency of these formal professions of attachment  to the throne with the very practical hostility of their authors to  British policy, struck the High Commissioner with peculiar force. The  Dutch, who, under British rule, enjoyed--one might almost say  abused--every privilege of citizenship in the Cape Colony, were quite  prepared to see the British excluded, under Dutch rule, from these  same privileges in the Transvaal. More than that, they were determined  to employ all the agencies at their command to prevent any effective  interference with the Transvaal oligarchy. Lord Milner evidently felt  that the time had come for remonstrance, so, gathering up the  impressions which had been accumulating in his mind, he wrote down  then and there his answer, which was delivered on the following day.         \"Of course, I am glad to be assured that any section of Her       Majesty's subjects is loyal, but I should be much more glad to be       allowed to take that for granted. Why should I not? What reason       could there be for any disloyalty? You have thriven wonderfully       well under Her Majesty's Government. This country, despite its       great extent and its fine climate, has some tremendous natural       disadvantages to contend against, and yet let any one compare the       position to-day with what it was at the commencement of Her       Majesty's reign, or even thirty years ago. The progress in       material wealth is enormous, and the prospects of future progress       are greater still. And you have other blessings which by no means       always accompany material wealth. You live under an absolutely       free system of government, protecting the rights and encouraging       the spirit of independence of every citizen. You have courts of       law manned by men of the highest ability and integrity, and       secure in the discharge of their high functions from all external       interference. You have--at least as regards the white       races--perfect equality of citizenship. And these things have not       been won from a reluctant sovereign. They have been freely and       gladly bestowed upon you, because freedom and self-government,       justice and equality, are the first principles of British policy.       And they are secured to you by the strength of the power that       gave them, and whose navy protects your shores from attack       without your being asked to contribute one pound to that       protection unless you yourselves desire it. Well, gentlemen, of       course you are loyal; it would be monstrous if you were not.         \"And now, if I have one wish, it is that I may never again have       to deal at any length with this topic. But in order that I may       put it aside with a good conscience, I wish, having been more or       less compelled to deal with it, to do so honestly, and not to       shut my eyes to unpleasant facts. The great bulk of the       population of the Colony--Dutch as well as English--are, I firmly       believe, thoroughly loyal, in the sense that they know they live       under a good constitution, and have no wish to change it, and       regard with feelings of reverence and pride that august lady at       the head of it. If we had only domestic questions to consider; if       political controversy were confined to the internal affairs of       the country, there would, no doubt, be a great deal of hard       language used by conflicting parties, and very likely among the       usual amenities of party warfare somebody would call somebody       else disloyal; but the thing would be so absurd--so obviously       absurd--that nobody would take it seriously, and the charges       would be forgotten almost as soon as uttered.    [Sidenote: The loyalty of the Bond.]         \"What gives the sting to the charge of disloyalty in this case,       what makes it stick, and what makes people wince under it, is the       fact that the political controversies of this country at present       unfortunately turn largely upon another question--I mean the       relations of Her Majesty's Government to the South African       Republic--and that, whenever there is any prospect of any       difference between them, a number of people in the Colony at once       vehemently, and without even the semblance of impartiality,       espouse the side of the Republic. Personally I do not think that       they are disloyal. I am familiar at home with the figure of the       politician--often the best of men, though singularly       injudicious--who, whenever any disputes arise with another       country, starts with the assumption that his own country must be       in the wrong. He is not disloyal, but really he cannot be very       much surprised if he appears to be so to those of his       fellow-citizens whose inclination is to start with the exactly       opposite assumption. And so I do not take it that in this case       people are necessarily disloyal because they carry their sympathy       with the Government of the Transvaal--which, seeing the close tie       of relationship which unites a great portion of the population       here with the dominant section in that country, is perfectly       natural--to a point which gives some ground for the assertion       that they seem to care much more for the independence of the       Transvaal than for the honour and the interests of the country to       which they themselves belong.         \"For my own part, I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26500"],[0,"Anecdotes of Dogs (#18)"],[1,"was held in high esteem by our ancestors, and was even  imported into Gaul for the purposes of the chase. Campion expressly  speaks of the Irish wolf-dog as a 'greyhound of great bone and limb.'  Silaus calls it also a greyhound, and asserts that it was imported  into Ireland by the Belgae, and is the same with the renowned Belgic  dog of antiquity, and that it was, during the days of Roman grandeur,  brought to Rome for the combats of the Amphitheatre. Pliny relates a  combat in which the Irish wolf-dog took a part: he calls them 'Canes  Graii Hibernici,' and describes them as much taller than the mastiff.  Holinshed, in speaking of the Irish, says, 'They are not without  wolves, and greyhounds to hunt them.' Evelyn, speaking of the  bear-garden, says, 'The bull-dogs did exceeding well, but the Irish  wolf-dog exceeded; which was a tall greyhound, a stately creature, and  beat a cruel mastiff.'    \"Llewellyn, prince of Wales, was presented by King John with a  specimen of this kind of dog. These animals were in those days  permitted to be kept only by princes and chiefs; and in the Welsh laws  of the ninth century we find heavy penalties laid down for the maiming  or injuring of the Irish greyhound, or, as it was styled in the code  alluded to, 'Canis Graius Hibernicus;' and a value was set on them,  equal to more than double that set on the ordinary greyhound.    \"Moryson, secretary to Lord-deputy Mountjoy, says, 'The Irishmen and  greyhounds are of great stature.' Lombard remarks, that the finest  hunting dogs in Europe were produced in Ireland: 'Greyhounds useful to  take the stag, wild boar, or wolf.' Pennant describes these dogs as  scarce, and as being led to the chase in leather slips or thongs, and  calls them 'the Irish greyhound.' Bay mentions him as the greatest dog  he had ever seen. Buffon says, he saw an Irish greyhound, which  measured five feet in height when in a sitting posture, and says that  all other sorts of greyhounds are descended from him, and that in  Scotland it is called the Highland greyhound: that it is very large,  deep-chested, and covered with long rough hair.    \"Scottish noblemen were not always content with such specimens of this  dog as their own country produced, but frequently sent for them to  Ireland, conceiving, doubtless, that they would be found better and  purer in their native land. The following is a copy of a letter  addressed by Deputy Falkland to the Earl of Cork, in 1623:--        'My Lord,        'I have lately received letters from my Lord Duke of Buccleuch and      others of my noble friends, who have entreated me to send them      some greyhound dogs and bitches, out of this kingdom, of the      largest sort, which I perceive they intend to present unto divers      princes and other noble persons; and if you can possibly, let them      be white, which is the colour most in request here. Expecting your      answer by the bearer, I commit you to the protection of the      Almighty, and am your Lordship's attached friend,                                                               'FALKLAND.'    \"Smith, in his 'History of Waterford,' says, 'the Irish greyhound is  nearly extinct: it is much taller than a mastiff, but more like a  greyhound, and for size, strength, and shape, cannot be equalled.  Roderick, king of Connaught, was obliged to furnish hawks and  greyhounds to Henry II. Sir Thomas Rue obtained great favour from the  Great Mogul in 1615, for a brace of Irish greyhounds presented by him.  Henry VIII. presented the Marquis of Dessarages, a Spanish grandee,  with two goshawks and four Irish greyhounds.'    \"Perhaps sufficient evidence has now been adduced to demonstrate the  identity of the Irish wolf-dog with the Highland deer-hound. I may,  however, in conclusion, give an extract from the excellent paper of  Mr. Haffield, already alluded to, as having been read before the  Dublin Natural History Society, and which was received by that  gentleman from Sir William Betham, Ulster King-at-Arms, an authority  of very high importance on any subject connected with Irish  antiquities. Sir William says,--'From the mention of the wolf-dogs in  the old Irish poems and stories, and also from what I have heard from  a very old person, long since dead, of his having seen them at 'The  Neale,' in the county of Mayo, the seat of Sir John Browne, ancestor  to Lord Kilmaine, I have no doubt they were a gigantic greyhound. My  departed friend described them as being very gentle, and says that Sir  John Browne allowed them to come into his dining-room, where they put  their heads over the shoulders of those who sat at table. They were  not smooth-skinned, like our greyhounds, but rough and curly-haired.  The Irish poets call the wolf-dog 'Cu,' and the common greyhound  'Gayer;' a marked distinction, the word 'Cu' signifying a champion.'    \"The colour of these dogs varies, but the most esteemed are dark  iron-grey, with white breast. They are, however, to be found of a  yellowish or sandy hue, brindled, or even white. In former times, as  will be seen from Lord Falkland's letter quoted above, this latter  colour was by many preferred. It is described as a stately, majestic  animal, extremely good-tempered and quiet in his disposition, unless  when irritated or excited, when he becomes furious; and is, in  consequence of his tremendous strength, a truly formidable animal.\"    Goldsmith asserts that he had seen a dozen of these dogs, and informs  us \"that the largest was about four feet high, or as tall as a calf of  a year old. They are generally of a white or cinnamon colour, and more  robust than the greyhound--their aspect mild, and their disposition  gentle and peaceable. It is said that their strength is so great, that  in combat the mastiff or bull-dog is far from equal to them. They  commonly seize their antagonists by the back and shake them to death.  These dogs were never serviceable for hunting, either the stag, the  fox, or the hare. Their chief utility was in hunting wolves, and to  this breed may be attributed the final extirpation of those ferocious  animals in England and Wales in early times in the woody districts.\"    Having thus given these different accounts of the Irish wolf-dog, I  may add that some persons are of opinion that there were two kinds of  them--one partaking of the shape and disposition of the mastiff, and  the other of the Highland deer-hound. It is not improbable that a  noble cross of dogs might have been made from these two sorts. At all  events I have fairly stated the whole of the information I have been  able to obtain respecting these dogs, and my readers must form their  own opinions. The following anecdote, recently communicated to me, is  given in the words of the writer:--    \"Two whelps were made a present to my brother by Harvey Combe, of a  breed between the old Irish wolf-dog and the blood-hound. My brother  gave them to Robert Evatt, of Mount Louise, county Monaghan. One died  young, but the other grew to be a very noble animal indeed.  Unfortunately he took to chasing sheep, and became an incorrigible  destroyer of that inoffensive but valuable stock. Evatt found he could  not afford to keep such a marauder, and as he was going to Dublin he  took up the sheep-killer, in order to present him to the Zoological  Society as a fine specimen of the breed. His servant was holding him  at the door of the hotel when a gig drove up, and the gentleman  alighted. The dog sprung from the servant's hold, and jumping into the  gig with one bound, seized the mat at the bottom of the gig, which was  made of sheepskin, and with another bound made away with his woolly  prize, and was brought back with difficulty, after a long and  fatiguing pursuit.\"    This is one of the most desperate cases of sheep-hunting in dogs I  ever met with. It is said, that this propensity may be got rid of by  tying a cord covered with wool to the dog's lower jaw, so that the  wool may be kept in the mouth.    I should mention, that in a manuscript of Froissart in the British  Museum, which is highly illuminated, there is a representation of the  grand entrance of Queen Isabel of England into Paris, in the year  1324. She is attended by a noble greyhound, who has a flag, _powdered_  with fleurs-de-lys, bound to his neck.    Greyhounds were a favourite species of dog in the middle ages. In the  ancient pipe-rolls, payments are frequently made in greyhounds. In  Hawes' \"Pastime of Pleasure,\" (written in the time of Henry VII.) Fame  is attended by two greyhounds, on whose golden collars, \"Grace\" and  \"Governaunce\" are inscribed in diamond letters.    In the pictures of Rubens, Snyders, and other old masters, some of the  powerful dogs there represented would appear to be a breed between the  greyhound and mastiff. Nothing can exceed the majestic and commanding  appearance of these dogs, and such a breed would be most likely to  produce the sort of animal most capable of contending with the wolf.    The Irish wolf-dogs were formerly placed as the supporters of the arms  of the ancient Monarchs of Ireland. They were collared _or_, with the  motto,        \"Gentle when stroked--fierce when provoked.\"    Mr. Scrope, in his agreeable book on deer-stalking in Scotland, has  communicated an account from Mr. Macneill, of Colonsay, of the  Highland deer-hound, in which are some interesting remarks relative to  the Irish wolf-dog, and from which I shall make a few extracts.    In making these extracts, it is impossible not to be struck with a  remark in the work referred to, that from modern writers we learn  nothing further respecting the Irish wolf-dog, than that such a race  of dogs at one time existed in Ireland, that they were of a gigantic  size, and that they are now extinct.    One great obstacle in the way of investigating the history of this dog  has arisen from the different appellations given to it, according to  the fancy of the natives in different "]]]
