For is not each of  these facts a thread in the tapestry web of the spell? The eyes see the  rapture of this very perfect blue. The imagination hears, as if very  far off, the solemn chanting of priests and smells the smoke of strange  perfumes, and sees the long, aquiline nose and the thin, haughty lips of  the goddess. And the color becomes strange to the eyes as well as  very lovely, because, perhaps, it was there--it almost certainly was  there--when from Constantinople went forth the decree that all Egypt  should be Christian; when the priests of the sacred brotherhood of Isis  were driven from their temple.    Isis nursing Horus gave way to the Virgin and the Child. But the cycles  spin away down \"the ringing grooves of change.\" From Egypt has passed  away that decreed Christianity. Now from the minaret the muezzin cries,  and in palm-shaded villages I hear the loud hymns of earnest pilgrims  starting on the journey to Mecca. And ever this painted chamber shelters  its mystery of poetry, its mystery of charm. And still its marvellous  colors are fresh as in the far-off pagan days, and the opening  lotus-flowers, and the closed lotus-buds, and the palm and the papyrus,  are on the perfect columns. And their intrinsic loveliness, and their  freshness, and their age, and the mysteries they have looked on--all  these facts are part of the spell that governs us to-day. In Edfu one is  enclosed in a wonderful austerity. And one can only worship. In Philae  one is wrapped in a radiance of color and one can only dream. For there  is coral-pink, and there a wonderful green, \"like the green light that  lingers in the west,\" and there is a blue as deep as the blue of a  tropical sea; and there are green-blue and lustrous, ardent red. And the  odd fantasy in the coloring, is not that like the fantasy in the temple  of a dream? For those who painted these capitals for the greater glory  of Isis did not fear to depart from nature, and to their patient worship  a blue palm perhaps seemed a rarely sacred thing. And that palm is part  of the spell, and the reliefs upon the walls and even the Coptic crosses  that are cut into the stone.    But at the end, one can only say that this place is indescribable, and  not because it is complex or terrifically grand, like Karnak. Go to it  on a sunlit morning, or stand in it in late afternoon, and perhaps you  will feel that it \"suggests\" you, and that it carries you away, out of  familiar regions into a land of dreams, where among hidden ways the soul  is lost in magic. Yes, you are gone.    To the right--for one, alas! cannot live in a dream for ever--is a  lovely doorway through which one sees the river. Facing it is another  doorway, showing a fragment of the poor, vivisected island, some ruined  walls, and still another doorway in which, again, is framed the Nile.  Many people have cut their names upon the walls of Philae. Once, as I  sat alone there, I felt strongly attracted to look upward to a wall, as  if some personality, enshrined within the stone, were watching me, or  calling. I looked, and saw written \"Balzac.\"    Philae is the last temple that one visits before he gives himself to the  wildness of the solitudes of Nubia. It stands at the very frontier. As  one goes up the Nile, it is like a smiling adieu from the Egypt one  is leaving. As one comes down, it is like a smiling welcome. In its  delicate charm I feel something of the charm of the Egyptian character.  There are moments, indeed, when I identify Egypt with Philae. For in  Philae one must dream; and on the Nile, too, one must dream. And always  the dream is happy, and shot through with radiant light--light that is  as radiant as the colors in Philae's temple. The pylons of Ptolemy smile  at you as you go up or come down the river. And the people of Egypt  smile as they enter into your dream. A suavity, too, is theirs. I think  of them often as artists, who know their parts in the dream-play, who  know exactly their function, and how to fulfil it rightly. They sing,  while you are dreaming, but it is an under-song, like the murmur of an  Eastern river far off from any sea. It never disturbs, this music, but  it helps you in your dream. And they are softly gay. And in their eyes  there is often the gleam of sunshine, for they are the children--but not  grown men--of the sun. That, indeed, is one of the many strange things  in Egypt--the youthfulness of its age, the childlikeness of its almost  terrible antiquity. One goes there to look at the oldest things in the  world and to feel perpetually young--young as Philae is young, as a  lyric of Shelley's is young, as all of our day-dreams are young, as the  people of Egypt are young.    Oh, that Egypt could be kept as it is, even as it is now; that Philae  could be preserved even as it is now! The spoilers are there,  those blithe modern spirits, so frightfully clever and capable, so  industrious, so determined, so unsparing of themselves and--of others!  Already they are at work \"benefiting Egypt.\" Tall chimneys begin to  vomit smoke along the Nile. A damnable tram-line for little trolleys  leads one toward the wonderful colossi of Memnon. Close to Kom Ombos  some soul imbued with romance has had the inspiration to set up--a  factory! And Philae--is it to go?    Is beauty then of no value in the world? Is it always to be the prey of  modern progress? Is nothing to be considered sacred; nothing to be left  untouched, unsmirched by the grimy fingers of improvement? I suppose  nothing.    Then let those who still care to dream go now to Philae's painted  chamber by the long reaches of the Nile; go on, if they will, to the  giant forms of Abu-Simbel among the Nubian sands. And perhaps they will  think with me, that in some dreams there is a value greater than the  value that is entered in any bank-book, and they will say, with me,  however uselessly:    \"Leave to the world some dreams, some places in which to dream; for if  it needs dams to make the grain grow in the stretches of land that were  barren, and railways and tram-lines, and factory chimneys that vomit  black smoke in the face of the sun, surely it needs also painted  chambers of Philae and the silence that comes down from Isis.\"          XVIII    OLD CAIRO    By Old Cairo I do not mean only _le vieux Caire_ of the guide-book,  the little, desolate village containing the famous Coptic church of Abu  Sergius, in the crypt of which the Virgin Mary and Christ are said to  have stayed when they fled to the land of Egypt to escape the fury of  King Herod; but the Cairo that is not new, that is not dedicated wholly  to officialdom and tourists, that, in the midst of changes and the  advance of civilisation--civilisation that does so much harm as well  as so much good, that showers benefits with one hand and defaces beauty  with the other--preserves its immemorial calm or immemorial turmult;  that stands aloof, as stands aloof ever the Eastern from the Western  man, even in the midst of what seems, perhaps, like intimacy; Eastern  to the soul, though the fantasies, the passions, the vulgarities, the  brilliant ineptitudes of the West beat about it like waves about some  unyielding wall of the sea.    When I went back to Egypt, after a lapse of many years, I fled at once  from Cairo, and upon the long reaches of the Nile, in the great spaces  of the Libyan Desert, in the luxuriant palm-grooves of the Fayyum,  among the tamarisk-bushes and on the pale waters of Kurun, I forgot the  changes which, in my brief glimpse of the city and its environs, had  moved me to despondency. But one cannot live in the solitudes for ever.  And at last from Madi-nat-al-Fayyum, with the first pilgrims starting  for Mecca, I returned to the great city, determined to seek in it once  more for the fascinations it used to hold, and perhaps still held in the  hidden ways where modern feet, nearly always in a hurry, had seldom time  to penetrate.    A mist hung over the land. Out of it, with a sort of stern energy, there  came to my ears loud hymns sung by the pilgrim voices--hymns in which,  mingled with the enthusiasm of devotees en route for the holiest shrine  of their faith, there seemed to sound the resolution of men strung up to  confront the fatigues and the dangers of a great journey through a wild  and unknown country. Those hymns led my feet to the venerable mosques of  Cairo, the city of mosques, guided me on my lesser pilgrimage among the  cupolas and the colonnades, where grave men dream in the silence near  marble fountains, or bend muttering their prayers beneath domes that are  dimmed by the ruthless fingers of Time. In the buildings consecrated to  prayer and to meditation I first sought for the magic that still lurks  in the teeming bosom of Cairo.    Long as I had sought it elsewhere, in the brilliant bazaars by day,  and by night in the winding alleys, where the dark-eyed Jews looked  stealthily forth from the low-browed doorways; where the Circassian  girls promenade, gleaming with golden coins and barbaric jewels;  where the air is alive with music that is feverish and antique, and in  strangely lighted interiors one sees forms clad in brilliant draperies,  or severely draped in the simplest pale-blue garments, moving in languid  dances, fluttering painted figures, bending, swaying, dropping down,  like the forms that people a dream.    In the bazaars is the passion for gain, in the alleys of music and light  is the passion for pleasure, in the mosques is the passion for prayer  that connects the souls of men with the unseen but strongly felt world.  Each of these passions is old, each of these passions in the heart of  Islam is fierce. On my return to Cairo I sought for the hidden fire that  is magic in the dusky places of prayer.
