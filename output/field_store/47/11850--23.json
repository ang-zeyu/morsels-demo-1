Rather  singularly its popularity resulted from the strong efforts made to  forbid its use.    It was regarded as a stimulant and therefore it was forbidden to  followers of Islam.[34] But its power to prevent drowsiness and sleep  during the intolerably long religious exercises was a winning feature,  and so its use became general in spite of the fulminations against it.    Coffee culture was confined to Arabia until the close of the seventeenth  century; it was then introduced into the Dutch East Indies, and for many  years the island of Java became the main supply of the world. At the  present time, Java is second only to Brazil in coffee production. In the  Old World it is now also cultivated along the Guinea coast of Africa, in  Madagascar, India, and Ceylon. In the New World the chief areas are  Brazil, Venezuela, the Central American States, and the West Indies.    [Illustration: COFFEE PRODUCING REGIONS]    The coffee-tree may be cultivated in almost any soil that is fertile; it  thrives best, however, in red soil. Old, decomposed red lavas produce  the choicest beans. Coffee grows in any moist climate in which the  temperature does not range higher than 80 deg. F. nor lower than 55 deg.  F. An occasional frost injures but does not necessarily kill the trees,  which grow better in the shade than in the sunlight. For convenience in  gathering the crop, the trees are pruned until they are not higher than  bushes.    The fruit of the coffee-tree is a deep-red berry not quite so large as a  cherry. A juicy pulp encloses a double membrane, or endocarp, and within  the latter are the seeds which constitute the coffee of commerce.  Normally there are two seeds, but in some varieties there is a tendency  for one seed to mature, leaving the other undeveloped; this is the  \"peaberry\" coffee of commerce. The so-called Mocha coffee is a peaberry.    In their preparation the berries are picked when ripe and deprived of  their pulp. After pulping they are cured in the sun for about a week and  then hulled, or divested of the endocarp, a process requiring expensive  machinery. The coffee is then cleaned, and sacked.    The value of the product depends on two factors, age and the care with  which it is sorted. Formerly, in the Dutch East Indies, coffee-growing,  for the greater part, was a government privilege, and the crop was kept  for several years in storage before it was permitted to be  sold--therefore the term \"Old Government\" Java. Other coffee was  designated as \"Private Plantations.\" The quality of coffee is greatly  improved with age. Brazilian and other American coffee-beans are rarely  seasoned by storage.    American coffees are almost wholly sorted by machinery. This process,  however, merely collects beans of the same size; it still leaves the  good and the bad beans together, though it is to be said that among the  largest beans there are fewer poor ones. In the coffees handled by the  Arab dealers all the sorting is done by hand, the very choice grade  selling in the large cities of Europe for the equivalent of nearly three  dollars per pound. All machine-sorted coffee is greatly improved by a  subsequent hand-sorting to remove the imperfect beans.    The naming of the different kinds of coffee is somewhat arbitrary. Thus,  Brazilian coffees are commercially known as _Rio_ because they are  shipped from the port of Rio de Janeiro; the same name is applied to the  product shipped from Santos. Nearly all Venezuela coffees are called  _Maracaibo_ although they differ much in kind and quality; most Central  American coffee is sold as _Costa Rica_; most peaberry varieties are  known as _Mocha_; and most of the East India product is popularly called  _Java_, no matter whence it comes.    [Illustration: COFFEE PRODUCTION]    Of the American coffees Rio constitutes about half the world's product.  After sorting, the larger beans are often marketed as Java coffee, and  when the beans have been roasted it is exceedingly difficult to tell the  difference. The best Maracaibo is regarded as choice coffee, but its  flavor is not liked by all coffee-drinkers. The best Honduras and Puerto  Rico coffees take a high rank and command very high prices, retailing in  some instances at sixty cents per pound. A very choice peaberry is grown  in the volcanic soils of Mexico to which the name of _Oaxaca_ is given;  most of it is sold in the United States as a choice Mocha.    Mocha is the commercial name of a coffee at one time marketed in the  Arabian city of that name. Since the completion of the Suez Canal,  Hodeida has been the chief centre of the Arabian coffee-trade. Formerly  most of this coffee was grown in the Province of Yemen, but now it is  brought to Hodeida, from Egypt, Ceylon, and India.    About all the product is hand-sorted. The choicest is sold in  Constantinople, Cairo, and other cities near by, in some instances  bringing five dollars per pound. Very little, and only that of the most  inferior quality, ever finds its way into western Europe or the United  States. Even the best Mocha is not superior to fine Oaxaca coffee.    Java coffee is renowned the world over for its fine flavor. The best  quality was formerly that which had been held in storage to season for a  few years. The government coffee was generally the better, but some of  the private plantations crop is now equally good. Some of the Sumatra  coffees are equal to the best Java beans.    The Liberia coffees have never been favorites in the United States on  account of their flavor. In Europe they are used for blending with other  varieties.    Of the entire coffee-crop of the world, the United States consumes more  than three-quarters of a billion pounds--a yearly average of very nearly  eleven pounds for each inhabitant. This is nearly three times as much  per inhabitant as is consumed in Germany, and almost fifteen times the  average used in Great Britain. Nearly all the world's crop is consumed  in the United States and western Europe.    Chicory, parched grain, pease, and burnt parsnip are sometimes added as  adulterants to ground coffee. Of those, chicory most nearly resembles  coffee in flavor and taste. It is harmless and usually improves the  flavor of inferior coffee. A tariff recently placed upon chicory has  somewhat lessened the use of it.    =Tea.=--The tea of commerce consists of the dried and prepared leaves of  an evergreen shrub (_Thea chinensis_) belonging most probably to the  _camellia_ family. Tea has been a commercial product of China for more  than fourteen hundred years, but seems to have been carried thither from  India about five hundred years before the Christian era; for its virtues  were praised by (the probably mythical) Chinung, an emperor of that  period.    The cultivated plants are scarcely higher than bushes, but the wild  plant found in India is a tree fifteen or twenty feet in height. The  cultivated plant is quite hardy; severe winters kill it but ordinary  freezing weather merely retards its growth. It thrives best in red,  mouldy soils; the choicest varieties are grown in new soils. The leaves  are not picked until the plants are three or four years old.    Two general classes of tea are known in commerce--the green and the  black. Formerly these were grown on different varieties of the plant,  but in the newer plantations no distinction is made in the matter of  variety; the color is due wholly to the manner of preparation.    The plants are watched carefully during the seasons of picking, of which  there are three or four each year. The April picking yields the choicest  crop of leaves, and only the youngest leaves and buds are taken.[35] A  single plant rarely yields more than four or five ounces of tea yearly.  Each acre of a tea-garden yields about three hundred and fifty pounds.    After picking, the leaves are partly crushed and allowed to wilt until  they begin to turn brown in color. They are then rolled between the  hands and either dried very slowly in the sun, or else rapidly in pans  over a charcoal fire--a process known as \"firing.\" The former method  produces _black_, the latter _green_, tea. The color of the latter is  sometimes heightened by the use of a mixture of powdered gypsum and  Prussian blue. In the black teas the green coloring matter of the leaf  is destroyed by fermentation; in the green teas it remains unchanged.    The greater part of the Chinese tea designed for export is packed rather  loosely in wooden chests lined with sheet-lead, the folds and joints of  which are soldered in order to make the cover both air-tight and  moisture-tight. A full chest contains seventy-five pounds of tea. The  Japan product is also packed in moisture-tight wrappers, the original  parcels being usually ten-pound, five-pound, and pound packages. Similar  devices are used in preparing the India and Formosa teas for ocean  shipment.    The chief tea-producing countries are India (including Ceylon) China,  Japan (including Formosa), and Java. A successful tea-garden is in  operation near Charleston, S.C. A small amount is grown in the Fiji and  Samoan Islands. The Ceylon and Formosa teas take a very high rank.    [Illustration: AREA OF TEA PRODUCTION]    Great Britain and her colonies consume the bulk of the tea-crop. The  average yearly consumption per person is eight pounds in Australia, six  in Great Britain and Cape of Good Hope, and more than four in Canada. In  the United States and Russia it is less than one pound per person.    Before the opening of the Suez Canal, in 1869, most of the crop for the  English market was despatched by way of Cape of Good Hope. So important  was it to get the consignments to London without loss of time, that fast  clipper ships were built especially for carrying tea. Since the opening  of the canal the crop has been shipped mainly by the Suez route.    A part of the tea required for the United States reaches New York by way  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24902"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 2, No. 4, March, 1851 (#18)"],[1,"Lord \"came down in the sight of all the people  upon Mount Sinai.\"    \"'We gave ourselves up to the impressions of the awful scene; and read,  with a feeling that will never be forgotten, the sublime account of the  transactions, and the commandments there promulgated, in the original  words as recorded by the great Hebrew legislator.'\"    \"Other travellers have explored a valley on the southern base of Sinai,  which was shut out from the view of Dr. Robinson in his ascent by a long  ridge of rocks, and which has been found, by measurement of Krafft and  Strauss, and others, to be even greater than the valley of er-Rahah on  the north. This, it is supposed by Ritter and others, may have been  occupied by the Israelites at the giving of the Law. The locality of  this tremendous scene may perhaps be determined by future researches.    \"An American artist and scholar, Mr. M. K. Kellogg, has lately given an  interesting account of this valley, which appears to be much more  extensive than er-Rahah, and better suited for the accommodation of the  immense camp of Israel. To reach this station, the Israelites must have  continued their march much further down the coast than on the other  supposition, and turned at a bolder angle up into the mountains near the  modern town of Tur or Tor. Dophkah, Alush, and Rephidim, must also, on  this supposition, be transferred to other localities corresponding with  this supposed line of march.    \"If there be such a valley at the southern base of Sinai, it seems very  extraordinary that it should have escaped the notice of travellers. It  must be visible from the summit of Sinai (Jebel Musa); but, seen only  from that lofty summit, and running in an irregular line at the very  base of the mountain, they must have overlooked it in their brief survey  of the scenery, so grand, so gloomy and peculiar, which there engaged  their contemplation. The subject, however, is so curious and  interesting, that we insert in some detail the narrative of the American  traveller to which these remarks refer.    \"'Having read a letter which appeared in the _Literary World_[F] of the  20th November, from Dr. Ritter to Dr. Robinson, in which it is said that  Laborde, in his _Commentary_ \"has now for the first time established the  plain of Wady Sebaiyeh at the southern base of Sinai;\" and that this  \"furnishes an important point for the elucidation of the giving of the  Law,\" I have been induced to submit to the consideration of the public,  some of the notes from a journal which I kept during my travels in that  region in the spring of 1844.[G]    \"'Although I have not yet seen the Commentaries of Laborde, and  therefore cannot judge of their correctness in regard to this plain, yet  I am happy in being able to furnish some testimony as to its existence  and extent. Within the last few years a question has arisen as to the  existence of a plain in front of Mount Sinai, capable of containing the  multitude of Israelites who were to receive the commandments.    \"'Dr. Robinson is the first, I believe, who has attempted to prove that  no such plain exists. In his _Researches_ he finds a plain at the  north-east extremity of the mountain called er-Rahah, which he says was  \"the plain where the congregation of Israel were assembled,\" and that  the mountain impending over it, the present Horeb, was \"the scene of the  awful phenomena in which the Law was proclaimed.\"    \"'He says he was satisfied, after much inquiry, \"that in no other  quarter of the peninsula, and certainly not around any of the higher  peaks, is there a spot corresponding in any degree, so fully as this, to  the historical account, and to the circumstances of the case.\" Starting  upon the hypothesis that there is no other plain than the one he  describes, he has been obliged to give the name of Sinai to one of the  peaks which overlook this plain, in order that the Israelites might  witness the awful ceremonies attending the promulgation of the Law which  took place upon the holy mountain. If this hypothesis is founded on  truth, then tradition is at fault, which has given to another part of  this region the name of Sinai, and a capacious plain beneath it; we must  throw aside all our faith in such tradition, and commence investigations  which shall elicit the whole truth upon the subject.    \"'As many late travellers have been led into error respecting the  topography of this district, by adopting, without investigation, the  conclusions of Dr. Robinson, I feel it to be a duty to lay before you  such facts as may be of service to those who shall hereafter journey  into the wilderness of Sinai.    \"'On the 6th day of March, 1844, my two companions set out from the  convent at Mount Sinai, for the purpose of ascending the mountain St.  Catharine. I declined going with them, partly through indisposition, and  partly because I thought I could spend the day more usefully in making  sketches in the neighboring convent. After my friend's departure with  the guides, I took a little Arab boy with me to carry my sketch-book and  water-bottle, and walked up Wady Shueib, until I came to the little  Mountain of the Cross (Neja), which almost shuts up the passage into  Wady Sebaiyeh, and where I had, for the first time, a view of the  southern face of Mount Sinai. Here opened an extended picture of the  mountains lying to the south of the Sinaite range, for I was now some  three hundred feet above the adjacent valleys.    \"'After much difficulty, I succeeded in climbing over immense masses of  granite, to the side of the Mountain of the Cross, which I ascended  about five hundred feet on its south-western face, in order to obtain a  good view of the peak of Sinai, which I was anxious to sketch. Here,  close at my right, arose, almost perpendicularly, the Holy Mountain; its  shattered pyramidal peak towering above me some 1400 feet, of a brownish  tint, presenting vertical strata of granite, which threw off the  glittering rays of the morning sun. Clinging around its base was a range  of sharp, upheaving crags, from one hundred to two hundred feet in  height, which formed an almost impassable barrier to the mountain itself  from the valley adjoining. These crags were separated from the mountain  by a deep and narrow gorge, yet they must be considered as forming the  projecting base of Sinai.    \"'Directly in front of me was a level valley, stretching onward to the  south for two or three miles, and inclosed on the east, west, and south  by low mountains of various altitudes, all much less, however, than that  of Sinai. This valley passed behind the Mountain of the Cross to my  left, and out of view, so that I could not calculate its northern extent  from where I stood. The whole scene was one of inexpressible grandeur  and solemnity, and I seated myself to transfer some of its remarkable  features to the pages of my portfolio.    \"'I remained at work until nearly sunset, when I discovered people  coming towards me through the dark ravine between the mountain of Sinai  and the craggy spurs which shoot up around its base. I feared they might  prove to be unfriendly Arabs; but, as they came nearer I discovered them  to be my companions and their guides, who were returning from Mount St.  Catharine. As the shades of evening were approaching, I shut up my  portfolio, and descending the hillside, I joined my friends, and we  returned together to the convent. After dinner, they desired to see what  I had done during the day, and my sketch-book was opened to them. They  remarked, on seeing the drawing I had made, that as there was no plain  on the southern border of the mountain, I might as well have left out  the one seen in the drawing. After my assurance that I had copied what  was before me, they laughed, and remarked that none but a painter's  imagination could have seen the plain in question, for they had passed  entirely around the mountain that day, and could assert _positively_  that there was no such plain. Here was a difference of opinion  certainly, and one that I did not relish much, as it might at some  future time be the means of creating a doubt as to the faithfulness of  my eastern drawings. I begged them, therefore, to accompany me the next  day to that side of the mountain, and be convinced of what I told them.  They remarked that all authority was against me, and time was too  precious to go over the same ground twice.'\"    \"It seems that one of them, however, accompanied the writer in his  further exploration of the ensuing day, for he uses the plural number,  and speaks of his 'friend.' We thus condense his statements: One day  (7th March) is described as having been spent in Wady es-Sabaiyeh, or  the plain before Mount Sinai. After having penetrated into this wady, he  says: 'We took our course along the base of Jebel Deir, until we came to  a point whence the peak of Sinai was no longer visible, because of the  intervening point of Jebel Deir; then striking across Sebaiyeh to the  right, keeping Sinai in view, we stopped to contemplate the scene. Here  the plain is very wide, and forms one with Wady Sedout, which enters it  from the south-east at a very acute angle, and in the whole of which  Sinai is plainly visible. These two wadys make a width of at least the  third of a mile. The hills rising from the east and south of Sebaiyeh,  in front of Sinai, are of gentle ascent, upon which flocks might feed,  and the people stand in full view of Sinai. For many miles, perhaps six  or more, on the eastern border of this plain, are seen many small plains  high up among the hills, from all of which Sinai is plainly visible.  Near where we stood, a high, rocky platform of granite arose from the  plain, upon which I seated myself, and took a sketch of the valley to  its junction with Wady esh-Sheikh on the north, where stands _Jebel  Fureia_, a very conspicuous and singular mountain. At this point, Wady  Sheikh turns from its eastern course,"]]]
