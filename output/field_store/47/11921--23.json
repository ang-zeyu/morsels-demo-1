He also made a plentiful provision of  water for them, when they were to march as far as Pelusium, through a  dry country, which he did also in like manner at their return thence;  nor were there any necessaries wanting to that army. It was therefore  the opinion, both of Caesar and of his soldiers, that Herod's kingdom  was too small for those generous presents he made them; for which  reason, when Caesar was come into Egypt, and Cleopatra and Antony were  dead, he did not only bestow other marks of honor upon him, but made an  addition to his kingdom, by giving him not only the country which had  been taken from him by Cleopatra, but besides that, Gadara, and Hippos,  and Samaria; and moreover, of the maritime cities, Gaza 31 and Anthedon,  and Joppa, and Strato's Tower. He also made him a present of four  hundred Galls [Galatians] as a guard for his body, which they had been  to Cleopatra before. Nor did any thing so strongly induce Caesar to make  these presents as the generosity of him that received them.    4. Moreover, after the first games at Actium, he added to his kingdom  both the region called Trachonitis, and what lay in its neighborhood,  Batanea, and the country of Auranitis; and that on the following  occasion: Zenodorus, who had hired the house of Lysanias, had all along  sent robbers out of Trachonitis among the Damascenes; who thereupon had  recourse to Varro, the president of Syria, and desired of him that he  would represent the calamity they were in to Caesar. When Caesar was  acquainted with it, he sent back orders that this nest of robbers should  be destroyed. Varro therefore made an expedition against them, and  cleared the land of those men, and took it away from Zenodorus. Caesar  did also afterward bestow it on Herod, that it might not again become  a receptacle for those robbers that had come against Damascus. He  also made him a procurator of all Syria, and this on the tenth year  afterward, when he came again into that province; and this was so  established, that the other procurators could not do any thing in the  administration without his advice: but when Zenodorus was dead, Caesar  bestowed on him all that land which lay between Trachonitis and Galilee.  Yet, what was still of more consequence to Herod, he was beloved by  Caesar next after Agrippa, and by Agrippa next after Caesar; whence he  arrived at a very great degree of felicity. Yet did the greatness of his  soul exceed it, and the main part of his magnanimity was extended to the  promotion of piety.              CHAPTER 21.           Of The [Temple And] Cities That Were Built By Herod And       Erected From The Very Foundations; As Also Of Those Other       Edifices That Were Erected By Him; And What Magnificence He       Showed To Foreigners; And How Fortune Was In All Things       Favorable To Him.    1. Accordingly, in the fifteenth year of his reign, Herod rebuilt the  temple, and encompassed a piece of land about it with a wall, which land  was twice as large as that before enclosed. The expenses he laid  out upon it were vastly large also, and the riches about it were  unspeakable. A sign of which you have in the great cloisters that were  erected about the temple, and the citadel which was on its north side.  The cloisters he built from the foundation, but the citadel 32 he  repaired at a vast expense; nor was it other than a royal palace, which  he called Antonia, in honor of Antony. He also built himself a palace in  the Upper city, containing two very large and most beautiful apartments;  to which the holy house itself could not be compared [in largeness]. The  one apartment he named Caesareum, and the other Agrippium, from his [two  great] friends.    2. Yet did he not preserve their memory by particular buildings only,  with their names given them, but his generosity went as far as entire  cities; for when he had built a most beautiful wall round a country in  Samaria, twenty furlongs long, and had brought six thousand inhabitants  into it, and had allotted to it a most fruitful piece of land, and in  the midst of this city, thus built, had erected a very large temple to  Caesar, and had laid round about it a portion of sacred land of three  furlongs and a half, he called the city Sebaste, from Sebastus, or  Augustus, and settled the affairs of the city after a most regular  manner.    3. And when Caesar had further bestowed upon him another additional  country, he built there also a temple of white marble, hard by the  fountains of Jordan: the place is called Panium, where is a top of a  mountain that is raised to an immense height, and at its side, beneath,  or at its bottom, a dark cave opens itself; within which there is a  horrible precipice, that descends abruptly to a vast depth; it contains  a mighty quantity of water, which is immovable; and when any body lets  down any thing to measure the depth of the earth beneath the water, no  length of cord is sufficient to reach it. Now the fountains of Jordan  rise at the roots of this cavity outwardly; and, as some think, this  is the utmost origin of Jordan: but we shall speak of that matter more  accurately in our following history.    4. But the king erected other places at Jericho also, between the  citadel Cypros and the former palace, such as were better and more  useful than the former for travelers, and named them from the same  friends of his. To say all at once, there was not any place of his  kingdom fit for the purpose that was permitted to be without somewhat  that was for Caesar's honor; and when he had filled his own country with  temples, he poured out the like plentiful marks of his esteem into his  province, and built many cities which he called Cesareas.    5. And when he observed that there was a city by the sea-side that was  much decayed, [its name was Strato's Tower,] but that the place, by the  happiness of its situation, was capable of great improvements from his  liberality, he rebuilt it all with white stone, and adorned it with  several most splendid palaces, wherein he especially demonstrated his  magnanimity; for the case was this, that all the sea-shore between Dora  and Joppa, in the middle, between which this city is situated, had no  good haven, insomuch that every one that sailed from Phoenicia for Egypt  was obliged to lie in the stormy sea, by reason of the south winds that  threatened them; which wind, if it blew but a little fresh, such vast  waves are raised, and dash upon the rocks, that upon their retreat the  sea is in a great ferment for a long way. But the king, by the expenses  he was at, and the liberal disposal of them, overcame nature, and built  a haven larger than was the Pyrecum 33 [at Athens]; and in the inner  retirements of the water he built other deep stations [for the ships  also].    6. Now although the place where he built was greatly opposite to his  purposes, yet did he so fully struggle with that difficulty, that the  firmness of his building could not easily be conquered by the sea; and  the beauty and ornament of the works were such, as though he had not had  any difficulty in the operation; for when he had measured out as large a  space as we have before mentioned, he let down stones into twenty fathom  water, the greatest part of which were fifty feet in length, and nine in  depth, and ten in breadth, and some still larger. But when the haven was  filled up to that depth, he enlarged that wall which was thus already  extant above the sea, till it was two hundred feet wide; one hundred of  which had buildings before it, in order to break the force of the waves,  whence it was called Procumatia, or the first breaker of the waves; but  the rest of the space was under a stone wall that ran round it. On this  wall were very large towers, the principal and most beautiful of which  was called Drusium, from Drusus, who was son-in-law to Caesar.    7. There were also a great number of arches, where the mariners dwelt;  and all the places before them round about was a large valley, or walk,  for a quay [or landing-place] to those that came on shore; but the  entrance was on the north, because the north wind was there the most  gentle of all the winds. At the mouth of the haven were on each side  three great Colossi, supported by pillars, where those Colossi that are  on your left hand as you sail into the port are supported by a solid  tower; but those on the right hand are supported by two upright stones  joined together, which stones were larger than that tower which was on  the other side of the entrance. Now there were continual edifices joined  to the haven, which were also themselves of white stone; and to this  haven did the narrow streets of the city lead, and were built at equal  distances one from another. And over against the mouth of the haven,  upon an elevation, there was a temple for Caesar, which was excellent  both in beauty and largeness; and therein was a Colossus of Caesar, not  less than that of Jupiter Olympius, which it was made to resemble.  The other Colossus of Rome was equal to that of Juno at Argos. So he  dedicated the city to the province, and the haven to the sailors there;  but the honor of the building he ascribed to Caesar, 34 and named it  Cesarea accordingly.    8. He also built the other edifices, the amphitheater, and theater, and  market-place, in a manner agreeable to that denomination; and appointed  games every fifth year, and called them, in like manner, Caesar's  Games; and he first himself proposed the largest prizes upon the hundred  ninety-second olympiad; in which not only the victors themselves, but  those that came next to them, and even those that came in the third  place, were partakers of his royal bounty. He also rebuilt Anthedon,  a city that lay on the coast, and had been demolished in the wars, and  named it Agrippeum. Moreover, he had so very great a kindness for his  friend Agrippa,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2853"],[0,"Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero (#18)"],[1,"majesty which must be avenged; and even if Lygia succeeded in hiding,  Caesar would avenge himself on Aulus and Pomponia. If she wishes to  escape, let her escape from the house of Vinicius. Then Caesar, who does  not like to occupy himself with the affairs of others, may not wish even  to aid Vinicius in the pursuit; in every case it will not be a crime  against majesty.    But Lygia's thoughts were just the following: Aulus would not even know  where she was; Pomponia herself would not know. She would escape not  from the house of Vinicius, however, but while on the way to it. When  drunk, Vinicius had said that he would send his slaves for her in the  evening. Beyond doubt he had told the truth, which he would not  have done had he been sober. Evidently he himself, or perhaps he and  Petronius, had seen Caesar before the feast, and won from him the promise  to give her on the following evening. And if they forgot that day, they  would send for her on the morrow. But Ursus will save her. He will come;  he will bear her out of the litter as he bore her out of the triclinium,  and they will go into the world. No one could resist Ursus, not even  that terrible athlete who wrestled at the feast yesterday. But as  Vinicius might send a great number of slaves, Ursus would go at once  to Bishop Linus for aid and counsel. The bishop will take compassion  on her, will not leave her in the hands of Vinicius; he will command  Christians to go with Ursus to rescue her. They will seize her and bear  her away; then Ursus can take her out of the city and hide her from the  power of Rome.    And her face began to flush and smile. Consolation entered her anew, as  if the hope of rescue had turned to reality. She threw herself on Acte's  neck suddenly, and, putting her beautiful lips to Acte's cheek, she  whispered:    \"Thou wilt not betray, Acte, wilt thou?\"    \"By the shade of my mother,\" answered the freedwoman, \"I will not; but  pray to thy God that Ursus be able to bear thee away.\"    The blue, childlike eyes of the giant were gleaming with happiness. He  had not been able to frame any plan, though he had been breaking his  poor head; but a thing like this he could do,--and whether in the day or  in the night it was all one to him! He would go to the bishop, for the  bishop can read in the sky what is needed and what is not. Besides,  he could assemble Christians himself. Are his acquaintances few among  slaves, gladiators, and free people, both in the Subura and beyond the  bridges? He can collect a couple of thousand of them. He will rescue his  lady, and take her outside the city, and he can go with her. They will  go to the end of the world, even to that place from which they had come,  where no one has heard of Rome.    Here he began to look forward, as if to see things in the future and  very distant.    \"To the forest? Ai, what a forest, what a forest!\"    But after a while he shook himself out of his visions. Well, he will go  to the bishop at once, and in the evening will wait with something like  a hundred men for the litter. And let not slaves, but even pretorians,  take her from him! Better for any man not to come under his fist, even  though in iron armor,--for is iron so strong? When he strikes iron  earnestly, the head underneath will not survive.    But Lygia raised her finger with great and also childlike seriousness.    \"Ursus, do not kill,\" said she.    Ursus put his fist, which was like a maul, to the back of his head, and,  rubbing his neck with great seriousness, began to mutter. But he must  rescue \"his light.\" She herself had said that his turn had come. He will  try all he can. But if something happens in spite of him? In every case  he must save her. But should anything happen, he will repent, and so  entreat the Innocent Lamb that the Crucified Lamb will have mercy on  him, poor fellow. He has no wish to offend the Lamb; but then his hands  are so heavy.    Great tenderness was expressed on his face; but wishing to hide it, he  bowed and said,--\"Now I will go to the holy bishop.\"    Acte put her arms around Lygia's neck, and began to weep. Once more the  freedwoman understood that there was a world in which greater happiness  existed, even in suffering, than in all the excesses and luxury of  Caesar's house. Once more a kind of door to the light was opened a little  before her, but she felt at once that she was unworthy to pass through  it.          Chapter IX      LYGIA was grieved to lose Pomponia Graecina, whom she loved with her  whole soul, and she grieved for the household of Aulus; still her  despair passed away. She felt a certain delight even in the thought that  she was sacrificing plenty and comfort for her Truth, and was entering  on an unknown and wandering existence. Perhaps there was in this a  little also of childish curiosity as to what that life would be, off  somewhere in remote regions, among wild beasts and barbarians. But there  was still more a deep and trusting faith, that by acting thus she was  doing as the Divine Master had commanded, and that henceforth He Himself  would watch over her, as over an obedient and faithful child. In such a  case what harm could meet her? If sufferings come, she will endure them  in His name. If sudden death comes, He will take her; and some time,  when Pomponia dies, they will be together for all eternity. More than  once when she was in the house of Aulus, she tortured her childish head  because she, a Christian, could do nothing for that Crucified, of whom  Ursus spoke with such tenderness. But now the moment had come. Lygia  felt almost happy, and began to speak of her happiness to Acte, who  could not understand her, however. To leave everything,--to leave  house, wealth, the city, gardens, temples, porticos, everything that  is beautiful; leave a sunny land and people near to one--and for what  purpose? To hide from the love of a young and stately knight. In Acte's  head these things could not find place. At times she felt that Lygia's  action was right, that there must be some immense mysterious happiness  in it; but she could not give a clear account to herself of the matter,  especially since an adventure was before Lygia which might have an evil  ending,--an adventure in which she might lose her life simply. Acte was  timid by nature, and she thought with dread of what the coming evening  might bring. But she was loath to mention her fears to Lygia; meanwhile,  as the day was clear and the sun looked into the atrium, she began to  persuade her to take the rest needed after a night without sleep. Lygia  did not refuse; and both went to the cubiculum, which was spacious and  furnished with luxury because of Acte's former relations with Caesar.  There they lay down side by side, but in spite of her weariness Acte  could not sleep. For a long time she had been sad and unhappy, but now  she was seized by a certain uneasiness which she had never felt before.  So far life had seemed to her simply grievous and deprived of a morrow;  now all at once it seemed to her dishonorable.    Increasing chaos rose in her head. Again the door to light began to open  and close. But in the moment when it opened, that light so dazzled her  that she could see nothing distinctly. She divined, merely, that in that  light there was happiness of some kind, happiness beyond measure, in  presence of which every other was nothing, to such a degree that if  Caesar, for example, were to set aside Poppaea, and love her, Acte, again,  it would be vanity. Suddenly the thought came to her that that Caesar  whom she loved, whom she held involuntarily as a kind of demigod, was as  pitiful as any slave, and that palace, with columns of Numidian marble,  no better than a heap of stones. At last, however, those feelings which  she had not power to define began to torment her; she wanted to  sleep, but being tortured by alarm she could not. Thinking that Lygia,  threatened by so many perils and uncertainties, was not sleeping either,  she turned to her to speak of her flight in the evening. But Lygia was  sleeping calmly. Into the dark cubiculum, past the curtain which was not  closely drawn, came a few bright rays, in which golden dust-motes were  playing. By the light of these rays Acte saw her delicate face, resting  on her bare arm, her closed eyes, and her mouth slightly open. She was  breathing regularly, but as people breathe while asleep.    \"She sleeps,--she is able to sleep,\" thought Acte. \"She is a child yet.\"  Still, after a while it came to her mind that that child chose to flee  rather than remain the beloved of Vinicius; she preferred want to shame,  wandering to a lordly house, to robes, jewels, and feasts, to the sound  of lutes and citharas.    \"Why?\"    And she gazed at Lygia, as if to find an answer in her sleeping face.  She looked at her clear forehead, at the calm arch of her brows, at  her dark tresses, at her parted lips, at her virgin bosom moved by calm  breathing; then she thought again,--\"How different from me!\"    Lygia seemed to her a miracle, a sort of divine vision, something  beloved of the gods, a hundred times more beautiful than all the flowers  in Caesar's garden, than all the statues in his palace. But in the Greek  woman's heart there was no envy. On the contrary, at thought of the  dangers which threatened the girl, great pity seized her. A certain  motherly feeling rose in the woman. Lygia seemed to her not only as  beautiful as a beautiful vision, but also very dear, and, putting her  lips to her dark hair, she kissed it.    But Lygia slept on calmly, as if at home, under the care of Pomponia  Graecina. And she slept rather long. Midday had passed when she opened  her blue eyes and looked around the cubiculum in astonishment. Evidently  she wondered that she was not in the house of Aulus.    \"That is thou, Acte?\" said she at last, seeing in the darkness the face  of the Greek.    \"I, Lygia.\"    \"Is it evening?\"    \"No,"]]]
