[Illustration: \"Havelok sat up surprised\"]    However, Grim went the next morning to Jarl Godard and said: \"Lord, I  have done your behest, and drowned the boy with an anchor about his  neck. He is safe, and now, I pray you, give me my reward, the gold and  other treasures, and make me a freeman as you have promised.\" But  Godard only looked fiercely at him and said: \"What, wouldst thou be an  earl? Go home, thou foul churl, and be ever a thrall! It is enough  reward that I do not hang thee now for insolence, and for thy wicked  deeds. Go speedily, else thou mayst stand and palter with me too  long.\" And Grim shrank quietly away, lest Godard should slay him for  the murder of Havelok.    Now Grim saw in what a terrible plight he stood, at the mercy of this  cruel and treacherous man, and he took counsel with himself and  consulted his wife, and the two decided to flee from Denmark to save  their lives. Gradually Grim sold all his stock, his cattle, his nets,  everything that he owned, and turned it into good pieces of gold; then  he bought and secretly fitted out and provisioned a ship, and at last,  when all was ready, carried on board Havelok (who had lain hidden all  this time), his own three sons and two daughters; then when he and his  wife had gone on board he set sail, and, driven by a favourable wind,  reached the shores of England.      Goldborough and Earl Godrich    Meanwhile in England a somewhat similar fate had befallen a fair  princess named Goldborough. When her father, King Athelwold, lay dying  all his people mourned, for he was the flower of all fair England for  knighthood, justice, and mercy; and he himself grieved sorely for the  sake of his little daughter, soon to be left an orphan. \"What will she  do?\" moaned he. \"She can neither speak nor walk! If she were only able  to ride, to rule England, and to guard herself from shame, I should  have no grief, even if I died and left her alone, while I lived in the  joy of paradise!\"    Then Athelwold summoned a council to be held at Winchester, and asked  the advice of the nobles as to the care of the infant Goldborough.  They with one accord recommended Earl Godrich of Cornwall to be made  regent for the little princess; and the earl, on being appointed,  swore with all solemn rites that he would marry her at twelve years  old to the highest, the best, fairest, and strongest man alive, and in  the meantime would train her in all royal virtues and customs. So  King Athelwold died, and was buried with great lamentations, and  Godrich ruled the land as regent. He was a strict but just governor,  and England had great peace, without and within, under his severe  rule, for all lived in awe of him, though no man loved him.  Goldborough grew and throve in all ways, and became famous through the  land for her gracious beauty and gentle and virtuous demeanour. This  roused the jealousy of Earl Godrich, who had played the part of king  so long that he almost believed himself King of England, and he began  to consider how he could secure the kingdom for himself and his son.  Thereupon he had Goldborough taken from Winchester, where she kept  royal state, to Dover, where she was imprisoned in the castle, and  strictly secluded from all her friends; there she remained, with poor  clothes and scanty food, awaiting a champion to uphold her right.      Havelok Becomes Cook's Boy    When Grim sailed from Denmark to England he landed in the Humber, at  the place now called Grimsby, and there established himself as a  fisherman. So successful was he that for twelve years he supported his  family well, and carried his catches of fish far afield, even to  Lincoln, where rare fish always brought a good price. In all this time  Grim never once called on Havelok for help in the task of feeding the  family; he reverenced his king, and the whole household served Havelok  with the utmost deference, and often went with scanty rations to  satisfy the boy's great appetite. At length Havelok began to think how  selfishly he was living, and how much food he consumed, and was filled  with shame when he realized how his foster-father toiled unweariedly  while he did nothing to help. In his remorseful meditations it became  clear to him that, though a king's son, he ought to do some useful  work. \"Of what use,\" thought he, \"is my great strength and stature if  I do not employ it for some good purpose? There is no shame in honest  toil. I will work for my food, and try to make some return to Father  Grim, who has done so much for me. I will gladly bear his baskets of  fish to market, and I will begin to-morrow.\"    On the next day, in spite of Grim's protests Havelok carried a load of  fish equal to four men's burden to Grimsby market, and sold it  successfully, returning home with the money he received; and this he  did day by day, till a famine arose and fish and food both became  scarce. Then Grim, more concerned for Havelok than for his own  children, called the youth to him and bade him try his fortunes in  Lincoln, for his own sake and for theirs; he would be better fed, and  the little food Grim could get would go further among the others if  Havelok were not there. The one obstacle in the way was Havelok's lack  of clothes, and Grim overcame that by sacrificing his boat's sail to  make Havelok a coarse tunic. That done, they bade each other farewell,  and Havelok started for Lincoln, barefooted and bareheaded, for his  only garment was the sailcloth tunic. In Lincoln Havelok found no  friends and no food for two days, and he was desperate and faint with  hunger, when he heard a call: \"Porters, porters! hither to me!\" Roused  to new vigour by the chance of work, Havelok rushed with the rest, and  bore down and hurled aside the other porters so vigorously that he was  chosen to carry provisions for Bertram, the earl's cook; and in return  he received the first meal he had eaten for nearly three days.    On the next day Havelok again overthrew the porters, and, knocking  down at least sixteen, secured the work. This time he had to carry  fish, and his basket was so laden that he bore nearly a cartload,  with which he ran to the castle. There the cook, amazed at his  strength, first gave him a hearty meal, and then offered him good  service under himself, with food and lodging for his wages. This offer  Havelok accepted, and was installed as cook's boy, and employed in all  the lowest offices--carrying wood, water, turf, hewing logs, lifting,  fetching, carrying--and in all he showed himself a wonderfully strong  worker, with unfailing good temper and gentleness, so that the little  children all loved the big, gentle, fair-haired youth who worked so  quietly and played with them so merrily. When Havelok's old tunic  became worn out, his master, the cook, took pity on him and gave him a  new suit, and then it could be seen how handsome and tall and strong a  youth this cook's boy really was, and his fame spread far and wide  round Lincoln Town.    [Illustration: \"Havelok again overthrew the porters\"]      Havelok and Goldborough    At the great fair of Lincoln, sports of all kinds were indulged in,  and in these Havelok took his part, for the cook, proud of his mighty  scullion, urged him to compete in all the games and races. As Earl  Godrich had summoned his Parliament to meet that year at Lincoln,  there was a great concourse of spectators, and even the powerful Earl  Regent himself sometimes watched the sports and cheered the champions.  The first contest was \"putting the stone,\" and the stone chosen was so  weighty that none but the most stalwart could lift it above the  knee--none could raise it to his breast. This sport was new to  Havelok, who had never seen it before, but when the cook bade him try  his strength he lifted the stone easily and threw it more than twelve  feet. This mighty deed caused his fame to be spread, not only among  the poor servants with whom Havelok was classed, but also among the  barons, their masters, and Havelok's Stone became a landmark in  Lincoln. Thus Godrich heard of a youth who stood head and shoulders  taller than other men and was stronger, more handsome--and yet a mere  common scullion. The news brought him a flash of inspiration: \"Here is  the highest, strongest, best man in all England, and him shall  Goldborough wed. I shall keep my vow to the letter, and England must  fall to me, for Goldborough's royal blood will be lost by her marriage  with a thrall, the people will refuse her obedience, and England will  cast her out.\"    Godrich therefore brought Goldborough to Lincoln, received her with  bell-ringing and seemly rejoicing, and bade her prepare for her  wedding. This the princess refused to do until she knew who was her  destined husband, for she said she would wed no man who was not of  royal birth. Her firmness drove Earl Godrich to fierce wrath, and he  burst out: \"Wilt thou be queen and mistress over me? Thy pride shall  be brought down: thou shalt have no royal spouse: a vagabond and  scullion shalt thou wed, and that no later than to-morrow! Curses on  him who speaks thee fair!\" In vain the princess wept and bemoaned  herself: the wedding was fixed for the morrow morn.    The next day at dawn Earl Godrich sent for Havelok, the mighty cook's  boy, and asked him: \"Wilt thou take a wife?\"    \"Nay,\" quoth Havelok, \"that will I not. I cannot feed her, much less  clothe and lodge her. My very garments are not my own, but belong to  the cook, my master.\" Godrich fell upon Havelok and beat him  furiously, saying, \"Unless thou wilt take the wench I give thee for  wife I will hang or blind thee\"; and so, in great fear, Havelok agreed  to the wedding. At once Goldborough was brought, and forced into an  immediate marriage, under penalty of banishment or burning as a witch  if she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25550"],[0,"The Defiant Agents (#18)"],[1,"terror. What could a handful of primitively armed  and almost primitively minded Terrans do now if they had to dispute  Topaz with the Baldies?          10      \"Beyond this--\" Menlik worked his way to the very lip of a drop, raising  a finger cautiously--\"beyond this we do not go.\"    \"But you say that the camp of your people lies well out in the plains--\"  Jil-Lee was up on one knee, using the field glasses they had brought  from the stores of the wrecked ship. He passed them along to Travis.  There was nothing to be sighted but the rippling amber waves of the tall  grasses, save for an occasional break of a copse of trees near the  foothills.    They had reached this point in the early morning, threading through the  pass, making their way across the section known to the outlaws. From  here they could survey the debatable land where their temporary allies  insisted the Reds were in full control.    The result of the conference in the south had been this uneasy alliance.  From the start Travis realized that he could not hope to commit the clan  to any set plan, that even to get this scouting party to come against  the stubborn resistance of Deklay and his reactionaries was a major  achievement. There was now an opening wedge of six Apaches in the  north.    \"Beyond this,\" Menlik repeated, \"they keep watch and can control us with  the caller.\"    \"What do you think?\" Travis passed the glasses to Nolan.    If they were ever to develop a war chief, this lean man, tall for an  Apache and slow to speak, might fill that role. He adjusted the lenses  and began a detailed study-sweep of the open territory. Then he  stiffened; his mouth, below the masking of the glasses, was tight.    \"What is it?\" Jil-Lee asked.    \"Riders--two ... four ... five.... Also something else--in the air.\"    Menlik jerked back and grabbed at Nolan's arm, dragging him down by the  weight of his body.    \"The flyer! Come back--back!\" He was still pulling at Nolan, prodding at  Travis with one foot, and the Apaches stared at him with amazement.    The shaman sputtered in his own language, and then, visibly regaining  command of himself, spoke English once more.    \"Those are hunters, and they carry a caller. Either some others have  escaped or they are determined to find our mountain camp.\"    Jil-Lee looked at Travis. \"You did not feel anything when the woman was  under that spell?\"    Travis shook his head. Jil-Lee nodded and then said to the shaman: \"We  shall stay here and watch. But since it is bad for you--do you go. And  we shall meet you near this place of the towers. Agreed?\"    For a moment Menlik's face held a shadowy expression Travis tried to  read. Was it resentment--resentment that he was forced to retreat when  the others could stand their ground? Did the Tatar believe that he lost  face this way? But the shaman gave a grunt of what they took as assent  and slipped over the edge of the lookout point. A moment later they  heard him speaking the Mongol tongue, warning Hulagur and Lotchu, his  companions on the scout. Then came the clatter of pony hoofs as they  rode their mounts away.    The Apaches settled back in the cup, which gave them a wide view over  the plains. Soon it was not necessary to use the glasses in order to  sight the advancing party of hunters--five riders, four wearing Tatar  dress. The fifth had such an odd outline that Travis was reminded of  Menlik's sketch of the alien. Under the sharper vision of the glasses he  saw that the rider was equipped with a pack strapped between his  shoulders and a bulbous helmet covering most of his head. Highly  specialized equipment for communication, Travis guessed.    \"That is a 'copter up above,\" Nolan said. \"Different shape from ours.\"    They had been familiar with helicopters back on Terra. Ranchers used  them for range inspection, and all of the Apache volunteers had flown in  them. But Nolan was correct; this one possessed several unfamiliar  features.    \"The Tatars say they don't bring those very far into the mountains,\"  Jil-Lee mused. \"That could explain their man on horseback; he gets in  where they don't fly.\"    Nolan fingered his bow. \"If these Reds depend upon their machine to  control what they seek, then they may be taken by surprise----\"    \"But not yet!\" Travis spoke sharply. Nolan frowned at him.    Jil-Lee chuckled. \"The way is not so dark for us, younger brother, that  we need your torch held for our feet!\"    Travis swallowed back any retort, accepting the fairness of that rebuke.  He had no right to believe that he alone knew the best way of handling  the enemy. Biting on the sourness of that realization, he lay quietly  with the others, watching the riders enter the foothills perhaps a  quarter of a mile to the west.    The helicopter was circling now over the men riding into a cut between  two rises. When they were lost to view, the pilot made wider casts, and  Travis thought the flyer's crew were probably in communication with the  helmeted one of the quintet on the ground.    He stirred. \"They are heading for the Tatar camp, just as if they know  exactly where it is--\"    \"That also may be true,\" Nolan replied. \"What do we know of these  Tatars? They have freely said that the Reds can hold them in mind ropes  when they wish. Already they may be so bound. I say--let us go back to  our own country.\" He added to the decisiveness of that by handing  Jil-Lee the glasses and sliding down from their perch.    Travis looked at the other. In a way he could understand the wisdom of  Nolan's suggestion. But he was sure that withdrawal now would only  postpone trouble. Sooner or later the Apaches would have to stand  against the Reds, and if they could do it now while the enemy was  occupied with trouble from the Tatars, so much the better.    Jil-Lee was following Nolan. But something in Travis rebelled. He  watched the circling helicopter. If it was overhanging the action area  of the horsemen, they had either reined in or were searching a  relatively small section of the foothills.    Reluctantly Travis descended to the hollow where Jil-Lee stood with  Nolan. Tsoay and Lupe and Rope were a little to one side as if the final  orders would come from their seniors.    \"It would be well,\" Jil-Lee said slowly, \"if we saw what weapons they  have. I want a closer look at the equipment of that one in the helmet.  Also,\" he smiled straight at Nolan--\"I do not think that they can detect  the presence of warriors of the People unless we will it so.\"    Nolan ran a finger along the curve of his bow, shot a measuring glance  right and left at the general contours of the country.    \"There is wisdom in what you say, elder brother. Only this is a trail we  shall take alone, not allowing the men with fur hats to know where we  walk.\" He looked pointedly in Travis' direction.    \"That is wisdom, _Ba'is'a_,\" Travis promptly replied, giving Nolan the  old title accorded the leader of a war party. Travis was grateful for  that much of a concession.    They swung into action, heading southeast at an angle which should bring  them across the track of the enemy hunting party. The path was theirs at  last, only moments after the passing of their quarry. None of the five  riders was taking any precautions to cover his trail. Each moved with  the confidence of one not having to fear any attack.    From cover the Apaches looked aloft. They could hear the faint hum of  the helicopter. It was still circling, Tsoay reported from a higher  check point, but those circles remained close over the plains area--the  riders had already passed beyond the limits of that aerial sentry.    Three to a side, the Apaches advanced with the trail between them. They  were carefully hidden when they caught up with the hunters. The four  Tatars were grouped together; the fifth man, heavily burdened by his  pack, had climbed from the saddle and was sitting on the ground, his  hands busy with a flat plate which covered him from upper chest to belt.    Now that he had a chance to see them closely, Travis noted the lack of  expression on the broad Tatar faces. The four men were blank of eye,  astride their mounts with no apparent awareness of their present  surroundings. Then as one, their heads swung around to the helmeted  leader before they dismounted and stood motionless for a long moment in  a way which reminded Travis of the coyotes' attitude when they  endeavored to pass some message to him. But these men even lacked the  signs of thinking intelligence the animals had.    The helmeted man's hand moved across his chest plate, and instantly his  followers came into a measure of life. One put his hand to his forehead  with an odd, half-dazed gesture. Another half crouched, his lips  wrinkling back in a snarl. And the leader, watching him, laughed. Then  he snapped an order, his hand poised over his control plate.    One of the four took the horse reins, made the mounts fast to near-by  bushes. Then as one they began to walk forward, the Red bringing up the  rear several paces behind the nearest Tatar. They were going upslope to  the crest of a small ridge.    The Tatar who first reached the crest put his hands to cup his mouth,  sent a ringing cry southward, and the faint \"hu-hu-hu\" echoed on and on  through the hills.    Either Menlik had reached the camp in time, or his people were not to be  so easily enticed. For though the hunters waited for a long time, there  was no answer to that hail. At last the helmeted man called his  captives, bringing them sullenly down to mount and ride again--a move  which suited the Apaches.    They could not tell how close was the communication between the rider  and the helicopter. And they were still too near the plains to attack  unless it was necessary for their own protection. Travis dropped back to  join Nolan.    \"He controls them by that plate on his chest,\" he said. \"If we would  take them, we must get at that--\"    \"These Tatars use lariats in"]]]
