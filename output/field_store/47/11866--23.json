Then he put  them back to their safe roof, and, gathering up his tools, went on his  way, whistling a merry tune remembered from the days when he trudged  down Long-ago Lane to the pasture, for his father's cows. Late of  afternoon it used to be, while the nighthawks dashed overhead in their  air-hunts, showing the white spots in their wings that looked like  holes, and sometimes making him jump as they dropped and turned, with a  sudden \"boom.\"    No sooner had the sound of his whistle gone from the roof, than Mother  Nomer came back to her houseless home--any spot doing as well as  another, now that the twins were hatched and able to walk about. As she  called her babies to her and tucked them under her feathers, her heart  still beating quickly with the excitement of her scare, it would be easy  to guess from the dear way of her cuddling that it isn't a beautiful  woven cradle or quaint walls of clay that matter most in the life of  young birds, but the loving care that is given them. In this respect the  young orioles, swinging in their hammock among the swaying tips of the  elm tree, and the children of Eve and Petro, in their wonderful brick  mansion, were no better off than the twins of Mis and Mother Nomer.    Busy indeed was Mis in the twilights that followed the hatching of his  children; and, though he was as much in the air as ever, it was not the  fun of frolic and clownish tricks that kept him there. For, besides his  own keen appetite, he had now the hunger of the twins to spur him on.  Such a hunter as he was in those days! Why, he caught a thousand  mosquitos on one trip; and meeting a swarm of flying ants, thought  nothing at all of gobbling up five hundred before he stopped. Countless  flies went down his throat. And when the big, brown bumping beetles,  with hard, shiny wing-covers on their backs and soft, fuzzy velvet  underneath, flew out at dusk, twenty or thirty of them, as likely as  not, would make a luncheon for Mis the clown. For he was lean and  hungry, and he ate and ate and ate; but he never grew fat. He hunted  zigzag through the twilight of the evening and the twilight of the dawn.  When the nights were bright and game was plenty, he hunted zigzag  through the moonlight. When the day was dull and insects were on the  wing, he hunted, though it was high noon. And many a midnight rambler  going home from the theatre looked up, wondering what made the darting  shadows, and saw Mis and his fellows dashing busily above where the  night-insects were hovering about the electric lights of the city  streets. He hunted long and he hunted well; but so keen was his appetite  and so huge the hunger of his twins, that it took the mother, too, to  keep the meals provided in the Nomer home.    I think they were never unhappy about it, for there is a certain  satisfaction in doing well what we can do; and there is no doubt that  these birds were made to be hunters. Mis and his kind swept the air, of  course, because they and their young were hungry; but the game they  caught, had it gone free to lay its myriad eggs, would have cost many a  farmer a fortune in sprays to save his crops, and would have added  untold discomfort to dwellers in country and city alike.    Although Mis, under his feathers, was much smaller than one would think  to look at him, there were several large things about him besides his  appetite. His mouth was almost huge, and reached way around to the sides  of his head under his eyes. It opened up more like the mouth of a frog  or a toad than like that of most birds. When he hunted he kept it  yawning wide open, so that it made a trap for many an unlucky insect  that flew straight in, without ever knowing what happened to it when it  disappeared down the great hollow throat, into a stomach so enormous  that it hardly seems possible that a bird less than twice the size of  Mis could own it.    There were other odd things about him, too--for instance, the comb he  wore on his middle toe-nail. What he did with it, I can't say. He didn't  seem to do very much with his feet anyway. They were rather feeble  little things, and he never used them in carrying home anything he  caught. He didn't even use them as most birds do when they stop to  rest; for, instead of sitting on a twig when he was not flying, he would  settle as if lying down. Sometimes he stayed on a large level branch,  not cross-wise like most birds, but the long way; and when he did that,  he looked like a humpy knot on the branch. When there were no branches  handy, he would use a rail or a log or a wall, or even the ground; but  wherever he settled himself, he looked like a blotch of light and dark,  and one could gaze right at him without noticing that a bird was there.  That was the way Mother Nomer did, too--clowns both of them and always  ready for the wonderful game of camouflage!    They had remarkable voices. There seemed to be just one word to their  call. I am not going to tell you what that word is. There is a reason  why I am not. The reason is, that I do not know. To be sure, I have  heard nighthawks say it every summer for years, but I can't say it  myself. It is a very funny word, but you will have to get one of them to  speak it for you!    They came by all their different kinds of queerness naturally enough,  Mis and Mother Nomer did, for it seemed to run in the family to be  peculiar, and all their relatives had oddities of one kind or another.  Take Cousin Whip-poor-will, who wears whiskers, for instance; and Cousin  Chuck-will's widow, who wears whiskers that branch. You could tell from  their very names that they would do uncommon things. And as for their  more distant relatives, the Hummingbirds and Chimney Swifts, it would  take a story apiece as long as this to begin to tell of their strange  doings. But it is a nice, likable sort of queerness they all have; so  very interesting, too, that we enjoy them the better for it.    There is one more wonderful thing yet that Mis and his mate did--and  their twins with them; for before this happened, the children had grown  to be as big as their parents, and a bit plumper, perhaps, though not  enough to be noticed under their feathers. Toward the end of a pleasant  summer, they joined a company of their kind, a sort of traveling circus,  and went south for the winter. Just what performances they gave along  the way, I did not hear; but with a whole flock of flying clowns on the  wing, it seems likely that they had a gay time of it altogether!    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 2: See _Hexapod Stories_, pages 4, 110, 126.]          X    THE LOST DOVE    _One Thousand Dollars ($1000) Reward_      That is the prize that has been offered for a nesting pair of Passenger  Pigeons. No one has claimed the money yet, and it would be a great  adventure, don't you think, to seek that nest? If you find it, you must  not disturb it, you know, or take the eggs or the young, or frighten the  father- or mother-bird; for the people who offered all that money did  not want dead birds to stuff for a museum, but hoped that someone might  tell them where there were live wild ones nesting.    You see the news had got about that the dove that is called Passenger  Pigeon was lost. No one could believe this at first, because there had  been so very many--more than a thousand, more than a million, more than  a billion. How could more than a billion doves be lost?    They were such big birds, too--a foot and a half long from tip of beak  to tip of tail, and sometimes even longer. Why, that is longer than the  tame pigeons that walk about our city streets. How could doves as large  as that be lost, so that no one could find a pair, not even for one  thousand dollars to pay him for the time it took to hunt?    Their colors were so pretty--head and back a soft, soft blue; neck  glistening with violet, red, and gold; underneath, a wonderful purple  red fading into violet shades, and then into bluish white. Who would not  like to seek, for the love of seeing so beautiful a bird, even though no  one paid a reward in money?    Shall we go, then, to Kentucky? For 'twas there the man named Audubon  once saw them come in flocks to roost at night. They kept coming from  sunset till after midnight, and their numbers were so great that their  wings, even while still a long way off, made a sound like a gale of  wind; and when close to, the noise of the birds was so loud that men  could not hear one another speak, even though they stood near and  shouted. The place where Audubon saw these pigeons was in a forest near  the Green River; and there were so many that they filled the trees over  a space forty miles long and more than three miles wide. They perched so  thickly that the branches of the great trees broke under their weight,  and went crashing to the ground; and their roosting-place looked as if a  tornado had rushed through the forest.    Must there not be wild pigeons, yet, roosting in Kentucky--some small  flock, perhaps, descended from the countless thousands seen by Audubon?  No, not one of all these doves is left, they tell us, in the woods in  that part of the country. The rush of their wings has been stilled and  their evening uproar has been silenced. Men may now walk beside the  Green River, and hear each other though they speak in whispers.    Would you like to seek the dove in Michigan in May? For there it was,  and then it was, that these wild pigeons nested, so we are told by  people who saw them, by hundreds of thousands, or even millions. They  built in trees of every sort, and sometimes as many as one hundred nests  were made in a single tree. Almost every tree on one hundred thousand  acres would have at least one nest. The lowest ones were so near the  ground that a man could reach them with his hand.    [Illustration: _Suppose you should find just one pair._]    Suppose you "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2563"],[0,"Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#18)"],[1," good terms, and  these two, with the abbe Teray, of whom I shall speak to you presently,  formed a triumvirate, which governed France from the disgrace of M. de  Choiseul to the death of the king. But before I enter upon a detail  of those politics, of which you will find that I understand something,  allow me to continue the history of my presentation, and also to give  some account of Christian VII.    You know that his Danish majesty was expected with anything but pleasure  by the king of France, and with curiosity by the rest of the nation. Men  and women were impatient to see a king, under twenty years of age, who  was traversing Europe with a design of attaining instruction. Married  to a lovely woman, Caroline Mathilde, he had left her on the instant,  without suspecting that this separation would prove fatal to both. At  Paris, the real character of this prince was not known, but a confused  report of his gallantry was spread abroad, on which all the courtesans  of note in the city began to try all arts to please him, each hoping  to attract him to herself, and dip into his strong box. M. de Sartines  amused us one evening, the king and myself, by telling us of the plans  of these ladies. Some were going to meet his Danish majesty, others  were to await him at the barrier, and two of the most renowned,  mesdemoiselles Gradi and Laprairie, had their portraits painted, to send  to the young monarch as soon as he should arrive.    Christian VII entered Paris the latter end of the month of October,  1768. MM. de Duras complimented him in the king's name, and informed him  that they were charged with the office of receiving his commands during  his residence in Paris. The interview of the king and the illustrious  stranger took place at Versailles. Christian VII came thither in the  state-carriage, and was conducted by the duc de Duras into the apartment  of the dauphin, where he remained until Louis XV was prepared to receive  him. I had heard much discussion about this reception. It was said, that  to make a distinction between sovereign of a petty state and that of the  superb kingdom of France, it was requisite that the former should await  for some time the audience which the latter accorded. I am sure that  when the peace with Frederick was agitated, the face of Louis XV was not  more grave and serious than during this puerile debate about etiquette.    The duc de Choiseul, who had the control of foreign affairs, was in the  apartment to receive his Danish majesty, with his colleagues, the duc  de Praslin, the comte de Saint-Florentin (whom I have called by  anticipation duc de la Vrilliere), M. Bertin, M. Mainon d'Invau,  controller of the finances, and M. de Jarente, bishop of Orleans and  one of the ministry. He kept himself somewhat in the background, as  tho' from humility. The duc de Choiseul came up to him, and said, with a  smile,    \"Monseigneur, what brings you in contact with a heretic?\"    \"To watch for the moment of penitence.\"    \"But what will you do if it become necessary to teach him his _credo_?\"    M. de Jarente understood the joke, and was the first to jest upon his  own unepiscopal conduct, replying to the duc de Choiseul,    \"There is a person present who knows it; he will whisper it to me, and,  if necessary, the _Veni Creator_ also.\"    The king of Denmark was congratulated by the duc de Choiseul,  who discharged this duty with as much grace as wit. Afterwards M.  Desgranges, master of the ceremonies, having announced that Louis XV was  visible, the king of Denmark, preceded by his gentlemen and the French  ministers and lords, went to the king's cabinet, in which two arm-chairs  precisely alike were prepared, but his majesty of Denmark positively  refused to be seated. He entered into conversation, and felicitated  himself on seeing a monarch, whose renown filled Europe, and whom  he should take as his model. During this conversation Christian VII  displayed the greatest amiability. Our king, speaking to him, said, \"I  am old enough to be your father\"; to which he replied, \"All my conduct  towards you shall be that of a son.\" This was thought admirable; and  at the termination of the interview Louis XV appeared charmed with his  brother of Denmark. \"He is a complete Frenchman,\" said he to me, \"and I  should be sorry if he left me dissatisfied.\"    That same evening Christian VII visited monseigneur the dauphin, in whom  he did not find the urbanity of his grandfather. The conversation was  short and abridged out of regard to our prince, who only stammered,  without being able to find one polished phrase. Never was there in his  youth a more timid and awkwardly conducted prince than the present king.  I shall mention him and his brothers hereafter, but will now direct my  immediate attention to the king of Denmark. He supped the same evening  with Louis XV at a table with four and twenty ladies of the court,  selected from amongst those most celebrated for the charms of their  persons or their wit. As his Danish majesty was greatly struck with  madame de Flaracourt, the king asked him how old the lady might be in  his opinion.    \"Thirty, perhaps,\" was the reply.    \"Thirty, brother! she is fifty.\"    \"Then age has no influence at your court.\" I shall not copy the  \"_Gazette de France_\" to tell you of the sojourn of Christian VII at  Paris. I am not writing the journal of this prince but of myself. The  king one day said to me,    \"My brother of Denmark has expressed to the duc de Duras a great desire  to pay his respects to you, if you will accede to his wishes. I leave  you entirely sovereign mistress of yourself, not without some fear  however that the young king will steal away your heart from me.\"    \"Ah, sire,\" I replied, \"that is an unjust suspicion; I should be angry  about it if it were not a joke, and would refuse to see the king of  Denmark did I not know how fully you are assured of my attachment to  you.\"    \"I should not be so jealous, madame, if I did not set so much value on  it,\" was the reply of the king, as he kissed my hand.    The duc de Duras came the next day to inform me of the request of his  new king. It was agreed, in order to keep the interview secret, that  I should receive him at my own mansion in the Rue de la Jussienne,  and that he should come there without suite, and with the strictest  incognito. At the day and hour agreed he entered my house, escorting two  strangers of admirable presence. One was the king of Denmark, under  the name of comte de ------, and the other a nobleman of his suite.  Christian VII appeared to me a very handsome man. He had large and  singularly expressive eyes; too much so, perhaps, for their brilliancy  was not of good augury; and I was not surprised at hearing subsequently  that his reason had abandoned him, altho' he possessed and exerted his  wit most perfectly during our conversation, in which he displayed the  greatest gallantry. I could not reproach him with one single expression  that was objectionable, altho' the subject of conversation was delicate.  He discoursed of the feelings of the king towards me, and yet said not a  word that was unsuited or out of place, nothing but what was in the best  taste, and expressed with the utmost delicacy. I asked him if the ladies  of Denmark were handsome. \"I thought, madame,\" was his reply, \"until  now, that the ladies of my kingdom were the most lovely in Europe.\"    We did not talk of myself only: Christian VII spoke of Paris with  enthusiasm. \"It is the capital of the world,\" he remarked, \"and our  states are but the provinces.\" He sought out our most celebrated  _savants_ and _literati_, and was particularly delighted with  d'Alembert, Diderot, la Harpe, and M. the comte de Buffon. He greatly  regretted that Voltaire was not in Paris, and expressed his great desire  to see at Ferney the great genius (as he termed him) who instructed and  amused the world. He appeared weary of the fetes which were given,  and especially with the deadly-lively company of the two Duras. It was  enough to kill you to have only one of them, and you may imagine the  torture of being bored with both. The duke had promised Louis XV to be  as amusing as possible too! After a conversation of three hours, which  his majesty (of course) said had appeared but of a moment, he left me  delighted with his person, wit, and manners.    When Louis XV saw me, he inquired my opinion of his Danish majesty.    \"He is,\" I replied, \"a well-educated king, and that they say is a  rarity.\"    \"True,\" said Louis XV, \"there are so many persons who are interested in  our ignorance, that it is a miracle if we escape out of their hands as  reasonable beings.\"    I went on to tell the king our conversation.    \"Ah,\" cried he, \"here is one who will increase the vanity of the  literary tribe: they want it, certainly. All these wits are our natural  born enemies; and think themselves above us; and the more we honor them,  the greater right do they assume to censure and despise us.\"    This was the usual burden of his song: he hated men of learning.  Voltaire especially was his detestation, on account of the numerous  epigrams which this great man had written against him; and Voltaire  had just given fresh subject of offence by publishing \"_La Cour du Roi  Petaud_\" (\"The Court of the King Petaud,\" ) a satire evidently directed  as strongly against the king as your humble servant. M. de Voltaire had  doubtless been encouraged to write this libel by the Choiseul party.  He was at a distance, judged unfavorably of me, and thought he could  scourge me without compromising himself.    It was comte Jean who brought me these verses, in which there was less  poetry than malevolence. I read them, was indignant, and wept. The duc  d'Aiguillon came, and finding me in tears, inquired the cause.    \"Here,\" said I, giving him the poem, \"see if you can bear so gross an  insult.\" He took the paper, cast his eyes over it, and having "]]]
