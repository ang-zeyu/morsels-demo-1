The word came in this way to be a useful one to hurl at  the head of an enemy at all times, or by which to classify those who  lived outside the pale of common, human decency. For such as these last  there could be no hope, and the term as applied to them was judged to  carry with it the bitterest stigma, just as it continues to do in the  East to the present day. To be a Christian is to be a dog; to be a Jew is  to be a dog; an infidel is a dog; and to be known as \"a Jew's dog,\" or \"a  dead dog,\" is to have sunk to the lowest depths of depravity in the eyes  of all men.    But the way in which dogs were regarded did not stop with Jewish edicts  and Jewish opinion. When the ancient Egyptians made way for another type,  and Moslems took their place, the dog, honoured before as has been shown,  fell at once into an inferior position. The Moslem law took its colour  largely from Jewish practice, and the dog was generally looked upon by  the Mahomedan as unclean. He continues, as all the world knows, to be  still so regarded. The dog, in the East, is at once tolerated and  neglected: he may be slightly better than the pig, but, like that wholly  unclean animal, he is a scavenger, living largely on offal and what he is  able to pick up.    He is thus, for the most part, a poor creature, leading a poor life, and  being often much to be pitied. That he should have any future prospects  before him, seeing him as he is, might well be doubted. But this must  also be remembered, that if he is in various stages of development in  these far-off lands, and with little chance of betterment, he does not  differ greatly in these respects from vast multitudes of men among whom  he moves, whether they be white, yellow, brown, or black. The conditions  of his life are little by which to condemn him, just as they would be  insufficient in the case of others. Moreover, all classes certainly do  not so condemn him, or do they look upon him in quite the same light. By  the Parsees, for instance, he is not regarded as wholly unclean. Many of  them keep English-bred dogs, as also do some of the more Europeanised  natives of other classes, treating them much as we do, though this is  still uncommon. Hindus of good class and Mahomedans are found generally  to avoid them; but here again many Hindus, and such a caste as Sweepers,  will touch a dog without considering themselves defiled, just as a  Mahomedan will often hold or take charge of a dog, though he be careful  not to do so by the chain, or leather lead, but by slipping his _jharan_,  or cloth, through the dog's collar, and handling him that way. In many  Mahomedan villages the dog is found in numbers, the inhabitants being  glad of his services in shepherding their goats, though condemning him to  live outside the house, even though there be likelihood of his being  carried off by a prowling leopard.    In certain directions, therefore, the dog is seen to be at least  tolerated. But there remains one other remarkable fact to be noted. No  one can have travelled in the East, especially in Turkey, without  remarking the way in which the dog is generally regarded. Yet, in spite  of this, he is all the while certainly classed as supernatural, and by no  less an authority than the Koran. His uncleanness must be recognised;  but, on the other hand, how are his fidelity and courage to be  overlooked? They cannot be. And so this unclean animal, from whom men  shrink, lest by chance their garments touch him as they pass, is given,  as already related, a position in Mahomed's paradise, and, because of his  character, is deemed worthy a special place in that land of supreme  bliss. There is a chance, then, for the outcast here.                        *       *       *       *       *    It is time to look at the dog himself a little closer, and see what  characteristics he can bring forward in support of hopes that many human  beings entertain on his behalf.    Here is a dumb animal that, long before the dawn of history, is known to  have been man's close companion. Step by step, we see him advancing with  those to whom he is linked, until he raises himself immeasurably above  all other animals, and takes his place pre-eminently as the friend of  man. No one of those from whom he originally sprang was known to bark,  and no wild species does so. By and through man, the dog was endowed with  this means of expression, and was thus able to act as his more efficient  guard. It is an established fact that the dog barks when in contact with  man, and loses the power when separated from him. Such was the case with  the dogs that were left many years ago on the uninhabited island of Juan  Fernandez. The descendants of these dogs were found thirty years later to  have lost the power of barking, and only subsequently regained it with  difficulty.    The fact that the dog barks is not, however, the chief point. This  peculiar gift has been developed into a language, for it is by those  wonderful inflections of the voice in barking that the dog has learnt to  make man understand his meaning. Thus, as we all know, he is able to  convey, at will, a note of warning, to signal the approach of danger, to  show his anger, his alarm, his joy, the spirit that animates him in the  chase, to make his appeal for help, to declare the need of succour. His  bark has in these ways become his chief means of communication, quite  apart from the howl, the whimper, the whine, or the growl; the \"singing\"  that is associated with a pack of foxhounds baying at the moon; the  \"talk\" that the subject of these pages possessed to such an extraordinary  degree.    Then again, as he responded more readily to education, and acquired by  degrees something of the civilising instincts that were affecting man,  the dog became not only a trusty companion but a humble servant. Nor did  he stop here, for, what was still more remarkable, he certainly came by  degrees to reflect some of man's chief characteristics, as well as nearly  all human passions. By association of ideas he developed memory. By his  dreams and the various sounds he emits in sleep, he is seen to possess  imagination. His wonderful power of scent is found capable of being  turned to other uses than sport, and is even now not utilised in sundry  quarters as it might be. Then, too, he habitually forms his own  judgments, and these are usually exceedingly correct, as when he  recognises an intruder, or arrives at what is right and what is wrong  within the circle of his own domain. On many occasions he certainly gives  evidence of a conscience and the possession of the rudiments of the moral  sense. When he does wrong he frequently exhibits shame as well as  contrition, seeking forgiveness, and being often distinctly unhappy till  this is secured. So far does he occasionally carry this, that when he  knows he has transgressed rules, he will come and make confession, his  own honesty bringing upon him a punishment he would otherwise have  escaped, or serving to declare what was not previously suspected by those  about him.    But it is when we approach the higher qualities that the dog stands out  in his true light. The best of his class naturally possess these in  greatest perfection, but it is a fact that none are altogether without  them. His instinct, his patience and subservience to the will of his  master, his pluck and his courage, his fidelity that nothing seems  capable of undermining, his trustfulness, his power of sympathy with man  and with his own class, and, lastly, the touching and infinite depth of  his love--all these are characteristics that occasionally put man to  shame, but which make man always trust him more and more. In the face of  his marvellous instinct, man is not infrequently struck dumb as he  watches. A dog's patience is a thing to study, as well as one from which  to learn many a fair lesson. His pluck and courage are almost proverbial.  In many a case the odds against him seem not to make the slightest  difference: he will fight on to the end; let his master only lead, he  will follow to the death.    And it is here that his fidelity attains its very pinnacle. Faithful unto  death! Again and again, in innumerable instances, he has shown his  faithfulness long after the one he loved was dead. The dog in the  mediaeval legend that dug his master's grave, covered him with moss and  leaves, and then watched there for seven years, until he died himself,  has found many a parallel in real life. A well-known dog in the days of  the Stewarts was still beside his master's tomb three years after the  latter's death; and, in much later times, another dog, at Lisle, refused  to come away from the spot where his master lay, and remained on guard  for nine long years, the villagers recognising his fidelity by building  him a kennel and bringing him his daily food until he died.    And if an instance of the exhibition of grief on the part of a dog is  called for, some will remember the little dog in the far-away Sudan. He  was the property of the only officer that fell at Ginnis, and who had  been in the habit of taking him everywhere. When his master was consigned  to the sand, this dog was seen to be cowering beside the stretcher,  looking even smaller than before; and, when all was over, he had to be  lifted away from the edge of the pit, where he lay with his head hanging  over the edge in an abject state of grief. He was only a dog, and a small  one; but many a man, hardened by the experiences of a campaign, turned  away his head at the sight.    Few can have been much in the company of dogs without becoming aware of  their power of sympathy, the way in which they almost invariably show  this to their own kind, and also especially to man. For a dog to be  injured or ill is for others at least to leave him in peace; but with man  they go much further, as they do in many directions where man is  concerned.

Then as the workmen turned to disperse a few clear words from  some one in the throng behind caught Peter's ear:    \"It's more than likely the president means to push Strong along to the  top of the ladder. He is mightily interested in the boy; anybody can see  that. Mayhap the lad will make up to him for his own son who, I've heard  say, is a lazy little snob and a great disappointment to his father.\"          [Illustration]    CHAPTER X    THE CLIMB BECOMES DIFFICULT      It would not have been strange if with all this adulation Peter had come  to think himself a very clever boy--perhaps the cleverest one in the  world. Fortunately for his modesty, however, his daily life did not tend  to foster any such delusion. He received occasional commendation, it is  true, from his superiors, but to counterbalance it he continued to have  many a rebuke thrown at him during the year he and Nat toiled together  tanning hides. The newness of the work combined with a score of  well-meant blunders placed Peter Strong on entirely equal footing  with other workmen, and quite as liable to correction. Even had these  conditions been otherwise the memory of the lazy little snob who was a  great disappointment to his father would have served to crush in the lad  any undue sense of his own importance. Considering the popular rating of  Peter Coddington it certainly was just as well that he had entered the  works under some other name than his own.    But although the bitterness of this criticism rankled, its sting was  removed by the thought that lazy and snobbish as Peter Coddington had  been, thanks to Peter Strong he was neither lazy nor snobbish now; nor  was he, the boy acknowledged, the disappointment to his father that he  might have been had not prompt and heroic measures been taken. Yet even  Peter Strong was obliged to admit after truthful scrutiny of his  progress that there still was room for improvement. Accordingly he  accepted submissively the censure that fell to his lot and, as Carmachel  said, \"did not consider himself the whole tannery just because one room  in it was named after him.\"    It was not until the spring of that year that the next upward step  came; then Peter and Nat were sent to the Elmwood plant for a few  months' experience at the sole leather factories. The inconvenience of  going seven miles and back every day was nothing to Peter because of his  motorcycle; but for Nat the case was different. Poor Nat was dependent  on street cars and once or twice, owing to delays, was tardy at the  works. Then one morning the trolley broke down and Jackson was forced to  walk three miles, arriving an hour late. In consequence his pay was  docked. This injustice was too much for Peter. All day he thought about  it.    \"Father,\" he asked that evening when he arrived home, \"do you think you  would like to lend Peter Strong some money?\"    \"Lend money to Peter Strong! What for?\"    Hotly, earnestly, eloquently, Peter presented his case concluding with  the plea:    \"Strong has some money in the bank, sir, but it is not enough. If he  paid back what you lent him month by month do you think you could let  him have what he needs to get a motorcycle for Nat?\"    Mr. Coddington considered carefully.    \"I do not at all approve of Peter Strong's borrowing money,\" said he.  \"It is a bad habit to fall into.\"    \"But Peter Strong isn't going to make a habit of it, Father. And he  isn't borrowing for himself, you know.\"    \"Still he is borrowing.\"    \"Yes, because if he waited until he had the cash in the bank Nat might  be too old to ride a motorcycle,\" chuckled Peter, mischievously.    A quiet smile crept into the corners of Mr. Coddington's mouth.    \"Well,\" admitted he deliberately, \"the case does seem to be an urgent  one. I might for once consent to break over my rule and furnish the sum  necessary. Yet it is quite a large loan that Peter Strong is asking. I  hope he will have no trouble in repaying it.\"    \"I believe he can manage it all right,\" was the earnest reply. \"His  wages have been going up and will probably be raised still more in  future. It does seem a little bit risky to loan him so much money, I  confess, but I feel sure you will get it back if you are not in too much  of a hurry for it.\"    Something in this answer evidently amused Mr. Coddington, for he bit his  lip to keep back a smile and walked away to the window where he stood  for some time looking out. At last he turned.    \"We will close the deal, Peter,\" said he. \"Since you vouch for Strong I  will take a chance. I would advise you, though, to let me buy the  motorcycle, as I can get a better price on it than you can.\"    \"Thank you, Father.\"    Accordingly the dream that Peter had so long cherished really came true.  The motorcycle was purchased, and the crate containing it was set down  at the Jacksons' door the day before Easter.    Peter had planned not to say a word to Nat as to where it came from  and therefore was not a little chagrined when both the members of the  Jackson household jumped at once to the conclusion that the Coddington  Company had sent it. Nat's mother, who, as Peter well knew, was a very  proud woman, immediately refused to accept any more favors from that  source and in consequence poor Peter was driven to confess his part in  the mystery.    \"But, Peter, my dear boy, you can't afford any such present as this. How  have you the money to pay for so magnificent a gift to Nat? You, too,  are working for your living and although you have no one dependent on  you I am certain you do not possess a sufficient bank account to warrant  your making such an extravagant purchase. It is like your big, kind,  generous heart to want to do it, but of course Nat and I cannot let you  take all your savings and give them away. How did you manage to get the  motorcycle anyway?\"    \"I borrowed part of the money,\" explained Peter reluctantly.    \"Oh, Peter, Peter! Borrowing is a dreadful habit! Never borrow money.  You had much better go without almost anything than borrow money to get  it.\"    \"But I am paying up the loan week by week. My--the man I borrowed it  from is making it very easy for me, and is in no hurry for the whole  sum. You had better let me have my way, Mrs. Jackson. I am getting good  wages and shall soon be earning even larger ones. I might blow in my  spare cash on something dreadful--something much worse than a  motorcycle,\" pleaded Peter, teasingly.    Nat's mother shook her head.    \"I am not one bit afraid that you would.\"    \"Oh, you never can tell,\" chuckled Peter. \"Besides, can't you see that I  shall have twice as much fun with my own motorcycle if Nat has one too?  It is no earthly fun to go riding by myself.\"    This and many another such argument caused Mrs. Jackson to waver, and  having once wavered her case was lost. Peter pursued his advantage and  after a whole afternoon of reasoning succeeded in winning Nat's mother  to his point of view. The motorcycle therefore was accepted in the  spirit in which it was proffered and became Nat's most treasured  possession.    What sport the two lads had going and coming from work! What wonderful  Saturday afternoon rides they took through the surrounding country!    Their work at the sole leather tanneries was interesting, too. Here  many new phases of leather making confronted them. First there was  the tremendous weight of the great skins, which were so unwieldy that  they could not easily be handled and, like cowhides, had to be cut  into halves, or \"sidees.\" In addition to this they were usually  split--sometimes before tanning, sometimes after. The grain, or the side  next the hair, was the more valuable leather. After being split once the  splits could be split again, if desired, just as cowhides were. Some of  the hides were tanned in oak bark, some in hemlock, and some in a  mixture of both called union tannage.    Oak sole leather, the foreman said, was often considered preferable for  soling shoes because its close fibre rendered it waterproof, and it  seldom cracked. Much of the fine English leather imported into this  country was, Peter learned, oak tanned. Since oaks grew so plentifully  in Great Britain the bark was much less expensive there than here.    Hemlock leather--so deep red in color--was, on the other hand, used  largely for heavy, stiff soles to common shoes for men and boys, since  it made up in wear what it lacked in flexibility.    Union leather, being a combination of both oak and hemlock tannage,  possessed the virtues as well as the faults of each; it had not the deep  red of hemlock, nor the fine fibre of oak tanned leather. Still it was a  flexible material and was used, the foreman told Peter, for soling  women's shoes.    Sole leather seemed to the boys a very stiff and solid stuff after the  calf and sheep skins which they had previously handled.    Perhaps they did not enjoy the Elmwood tanneries quite as much as the  home works at Milburn, and perhaps they longed a little for their term  of service there to be completed. Nevertheless they made friends,  learned much that they were anxious to know, and had their motor rides  over and back each day together.    With so many of his ambitions reaching fulfilment it began to seem to  Peter as if life were a very smooth sea, and it was not until June when  he and Nat were transferred to the patent leather factory that he had  his first experience in navigating rough waters. This storminess came  about through Tolman, a sharp-tongued foreman who did not hesitate to  announce that too much favoritism had been shown Peter Strong in the  past.    \"I bet "]]]
