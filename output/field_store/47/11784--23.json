I was born an outcast in the world, in which I was destined to act so  conspicuous a part. My mother was a burning and a shining light, in the  community of Scottish worthies, and in the days of her virginity had  suffered much in the persecution of the saints. But it so pleased  Heaven that, as a trial of her faith, she was married to one of the  wicked; a man all over spotted with the leprosy of sin. As well might  they have conjoined fire and water together, in hopes that they would  consort and amalgamate, as purity and corruption: She fled from his  embraces the first night after their marriage, and from that time forth  his iniquities so galled her upright heart that she quitted his society  altogether, keeping her own apartments in the same house with him.    I was the second son of this unhappy marriage, and, ere ever I was  born, my father according to the flesh disclaimed all relation or  connection with me, and all interest in me, save what the law compelled  him to take, which was to grant me a scanty maintenance; and had it not  been for a faithful minister of the gospel, my mother's early  instructor, I should have remained an outcast from the church visible.  He took pity on me, admitting me not only into that, but into the bosom  of his own household and ministry also, and to him am I indebted, under  Heaven, for the high conceptions and glorious discernment between good  and evil, right and wrong, which I attained even at an early age. It  was he who directed my studies aright, both in the learning of the  ancient fathers and the doctrines of the reformed church, and designed  me for his assistant and successor in the holy office. I missed no  opportunity of perfecting myself particularly in all the minute points  of theology in which my reverend father and mother took great delight;  but at length I acquired so much skill that I astonished my teachers,  and made them gaze at one another. I remember that it was the custom,  in my patron's house, to ask questions of the Single Catechism round  every Sabbath night. He asked the first, my mother the second, and so  on, everyone saying the question asked and then asking the next. It  fell to my mother to ask Effectual Calling at me. I said the answer  with propriety and emphasis. \"Now, madam,\" added I, \"my question to you  is: What is Ineffectual Calling?\"    \"Ineffectual Calling? There is no such thing, Robert,\" said she.    \"But there is, madam,\" said I, and that answer proves how much you say  these fundamental precepts by rote, and without any consideration.  Ineffectual Calling is the outward call of the gospel without any  effect on the hearts of unregenerated and impenitent sinners. Have not  all these the same calls, warnings, doctrines, and reproofs, that we  have? And is not this ineffectual Calling? Has not Ardinferry the same?  Has not Patrick M'Lure the same? Has not the Laird of Dalcastle and his  reprobate heir the same? And will any tell me that this is not  Ineffectual Calling?\"    \"What a wonderful boy he is!\" said my mother.    \"I'm feared he turn out to be a conceited gowk,\" said old Barnet, the  minister's man.    \"No,\" said my pastor, and father (as I shall henceforth denominate  him). \"No, Barnet, he is a wonderful boy; and no marvel, for I have  prayed for these talents to be bestowed on him from his infancy: and do  you think that Heaven would refuse a prayer so disinterested? No, it is  impossible. But my dread is, madam,\" continued he, turning to my  mother, \"that he is yet in the bond of iniquity.\"    \"God forbid!\" said my mother.    \"I have struggled with the Almighty long and hard,\" continued he; \"but  have as yet no certain token of acceptance in his behalf, I have indeed  fought a hard fight, but have been repulsed by him who hath seldom  refused my request; although I cited his own words against him, and  endeavoured to hold him at his promise, he hath so many turnings in the  supremacy of his power, that I have been rejected. How dreadful is it  to think of our darling being still without the pale of the covenant!  But I have vowed a vow, and in that there is hope.\"    My heart quaked with terror when I thought of being still living in a  state of reprobation, subjected to the awful issues of death, judgment,  and eternal misery, by the slightest accident or casualty; and I set  about the duty of prayer myself with the utmost earnestness. I prayed  three times every day, and seven times on the Sabbath; but, the more  frequently and fervently that I prayed, I sinned still the more. About  this time, and for a long period afterwards, amounting to several  years, I lived in a hopeless and deplorable state of mind; for I said  to myself, \"If my name is not written in the book of life from all  eternity, it is in vain for me to presume that either vows or prayers  of mine, or those of all mankind combined, can ever procure its  insertion now.\" I had come under many vows, most solemnly taken, every  one of which I had broken; and I saw with the intensity of juvenile  grief that there was no hope for me. I went on sinning every hour, and  all the while most strenuously warring against sin, and repenting of  every one transgression as soon after the commission of it as I got  leisure to think. But, oh, what a wretched state this unregenerated  state is, in which every effort after righteousness only aggravates our  offences! I found it vanity to contend; for, after communing with my  heart, the conclusion was as follows: \"If I could repent me of all my  sins, and shed tears of blood for them, still have I not a load of  original transgression pressing on me that is enough to crush me to the  lowest hell. I may be angry with my first parents for having sinned,  but how I shall repent me of their sin is beyond what I am able to  comprehend.\"    Still, in those days of depravity and corruption, I had some of those  principles implanted in my mind which were afterwards to spring up with  such amazing fertility among the heroes of the faith and the promises.  In particular, I felt great indignation against all the wicked of this  world, and often wished for the means of ridding it of such a noxious  burden. I liked John Barnet, my reverend father's serving-man,  extremely ill; but, from a supposition that he might be one of the  justified, I refrained from doing him any injury. He gave always his  word against me, and when we were by ourselves, in the barn or the  fields, he rated me with such severity for my faults that my heart  could brook it no longer. He discovered some notorious lies that I had  framed, and taxed me with them in such a manner that I could in no wise  get off. My cheek burnt, with offence, rather than shame; and he,  thinking he had got the mastery of me, exulted over me most  unmercifully, telling me I was a selfish and conceited blackguard, who  made great pretences towards religious devotion to cloak a disposition  tainted with deceit, and that it would not much astonish him if I  brought myself to the gallows.    I gathered some courage from his over-severity, and answered him as  follows: \"Who made thee a judge of the actions or dispositions of the  Almighty's creatures--thou who art a worm and no man in his sight? How  it befits thee to deal out judgments and anathemas! Hath he not made  one vessel to honour, and another to dishonour, as in the case with  myself and thee? Hath he not builded his stories in the heavens, and  laid the foundations thereof in the earth, and how can a being like  thee judge between good and evil, that are both subjected to the  workings of his hand; or of the opposing principles in the soul of man,  correcting, modifying, and refining one another?\"    I said this with that strong display of fervour for which I was  remarkable at my years, and expected old Barnet to be utterly  confounded; but he only shook his head, and, with the most provoking  grin, said: \"There he goes! Sickan sublime and ridiculous sophistry I  never heard come out of another mouth but ane. There needs nae aiths to  be sworn afore the session wha is your father, young goodman. I ne'er,  for my part, saw a son sac like a dad, sin' my een first opened.\" With  that he went away, saying with an ill-natured wince: \"You made to  honour and me to dishonour! Dirty bow-kail thing that thou be'st!\"    \"I will have the old rascal on the hip for this, if I live,\" thought I.  So I went and asked my mother if John was a righteous man. She could  not tell, but supposed he was, and therefore I got no encouragement  from her. I went next to my reverend father, and inquired his opinion,  expecting as little from that quarter. He knew the elect as it were by  instinct, and could have told you of all those in his own, and some  neighbouring parishes, who were born within the boundaries of the  covenant of promise, and who were not.    \"I keep a good deal in company with your servant, old Barnet, father,\"  said I.    \"You do, boy, you do, I see,\" said he.    \"I wish I may not keep too much in his company,\" said I, \"not knowing  what kind of society I am in. Is John a good man, father?\"    \"Why, boy, he is but so so. A morally good man John is, but very little  of the leaven of true righteousness, which is faith, within. I am  afraid old Barnet, with all his stock of morality, will be a castaway.\"    My heart was greatly cheered by this remark; and I sighed very deeply,  and hung my head to one side. The worthy father observed me, and  inquired the cause, when I answered as follows: \"How dreadful the  thought, that I have been going daily in company and fellowship with  one whose name is written on the red-letter side of the book of life;  whose body and soul have been, from all eternity, consigned over to  everlasting destruction, and to whom "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22766"],[0,"Electricity for Boys (#18)"],[1,"it will fuse, and  pass into a vapor which causes the intense illumination.    The earliest form of electric lighting was by means of the arc, in which  the light is maintained so long as the electrodes were kept a certain  distance apart.    To do this requires delicate mechanism, for the reason that when contact  is made, and the current flows through the two electrodes, which are  connected up directly with the coils of a magnet, the cores, or  armatures, will be magnetized. The result is that the electrode,  connected with the armature of the magnet, is drawn away from the other  electrode, and the arc is formed, between the separated ends.    As the current also passes through a resistance coil, the moment the  ends of the electrodes are separated too great a distance, the  resistance prevents a flow of the normal amount of current, and the  armature is compelled to reduce its pull. The effect is to cause the two  electrodes to again approach each other, and in doing so the arc becomes  brighter.    It will be seen, therefore, that there is a constant fight between the  resistance coil and the magnet, the combined action of the two being  such, that, if properly arranged, and with powers in correct relation to  each other, the light may be maintained without undue flickering. Such  devices are now universally used, and they afford a steady and reliable  means of illumination.    Many improvements are made in this direction, as well as in the  ingredients of the electrodes. A very novel device for assuring a  perfect separation at all times between the electrodes, is by means of a  pair of parallel carbons, held apart by a non-conductor such as clay, or  some mixture of earth, a form of which is shown in Fig. 116.    The drawing shows two electrodes, separated by a non-conducting  material, which is of such a character that it will break down and  crumble away, as the ends of the electrodes burn away.    [Illustration: _Fig. 116. Parallel Carbons._]    This device is admirable where the alternating current is used, because  the current moves back and forth, and the two electrodes are thus burned  away at the same rate of speed.    In the direct or continuous current the movement is in one direction  only, and as a result the positive electrode is eaten away twice as fast  as the negative.    This is the arc form of lamp universally used for lighting large spaces  or areas, such as streets, railway stations, and the like. It is  important also as the means for utilizing searchlight illumination, and  frequently for locomotive headlights.    Arc lights are produced by what is called the _series current_. This  means that the lamps are all connected in a single line. This is  illustrated by reference to Fig. 117, in which A represents the wire  from the dynamo, and B, C the two electrodes, showing the current  passing through from one lamp to the next.    [Illustration: _Fig. 117. Arc-Lighting Circuit._]    A high voltage is necessary in order to cause the current to leap across  the gap made by the separation of the electrodes.    THE INCANDESCENT SYSTEM.--This method is entirely different from the arc  system. It has been stated that certain metals conduct electricity with  greater facility than others, and some have higher resistance than  others. If a certain amount of electricity is forced through some  metals, they will become heated. This is true, also, if metals, which,  ordinarily, will conduct a current freely, are made up into such small  conductors that it is difficult for the current to pass.    [Illustration: _Fig 118. Interrupted Conductor._]    In the arc method high voltage is essential; in the incandescent plan,  current is the important consideration. In the arc, the light is  produced by virtue of the break in the line of the conductor; in the  incandescent, the system is closed at all times.    Supposing we have a wire A, a quarter of an inch in diameter, carrying a  current of, say, 500 amperes, and at any point in the circuit the wire  is made very small, as shown at B, in Fig. 118, it is obvious that the  small wire would not be large enough to carry the current.    The result would be that the small connection B would heat up, and,  finally, be fused. While the large part of the wire would carry 500  amperes, the small wire could not possibly carry more than, say, 10  amperes. Now these little wires are the filaments in an electric bulb,  and originally the attempt was made to have them so connected up that  they could be illuminated by a single wire, as with the arc system above  explained, one following the other as shown in Fig. 117.    [Illustration: _Fig. 119. Incandescent Circuit._]    It was discovered, however, that the addition of each successive lamp,  so wired, would not give light in proportion to the addition, but at  only about one-fourth the illumination, and such a course would,  therefore, make electric lighting enormously expensive.    This knowledge resulted in an entirely new system of wiring up the lamps  in a circuit. This is explained in Fig. 119. In this figure A represents  the dynamo, B, B the brushes, C, D the two line wires, E the lamps, and  F the short-circuiting wires between the two main conductors C, D.    It will be observed that the wires C, D are larger than the cross wires  F. The object is to show that the main wires might carry a very heavy  amperage, while the small cross wires F require only a few amperes.    This is called the _multiple_ circuit, and it is obvious that the entire  amperage produced by the dynamo will not be required to pass through  each lamp, but, on the other hand, each lamp takes only enough necessary  to render the filament incandescent.    This invention at once solved the problem of the incandescent system and  was called the subdivision of the electric light. By this means the cost  was materially reduced, and the wiring up and installation of lights  materially simplified.    But the divisibility of the light did not, by any means, solve the great  problem that has occupied the attention of electricians and  experimenters ever since. The great question was and is to preserve the  little filament which is heated to incandescence, and from which we get  the light.    The effort of the current to pass through the small filament meets with  such a great resistance that the substance is heated up. If it is made  of metal there is a point at which it will fuse, and thus the lamp is  destroyed.    It was found that carbon, properly treated, would heat to a brilliant  white heat without fusing, or melting, so that this material was  employed. But now followed another difficulty. As this intense heat  consumed the particles of carbon, owing to the presence of oxygen, means  were sought to exclude the air.    This was finally accomplished by making a bulb of glass, from which the  air was exhausted, and as such a globe had no air to support combustion,  the filaments were finally made so that they would last a long time  before being finally disintegrated.    The quest now is, and has been, to find some material of a purely  metallic character, which will have a very high fusing point, and which  will, therefore, dispense with the cost of the exhausted bulb. Some  metals, as for instance, osmium, tantalum, thorium, and others, have  been used, and others, also, with great success, so that the march of  improvements is now going forward with rapid strides.    VAPOR LAMPS.--One of the directions in which considerable energy has  been directed in the past, was to produce light from vapors. The Cooper  Hewitt mercury vapor lamp is a tube filled with the vapor of mercury,  and a current is sent through the vapor which produces a greenish  light, and owing to that peculiar color, has not met with much success.    It is merely cited to show that there are other directions than the use  of metallic conductors and filaments which will produce light, and the  day is no doubt close at hand when we may expect some important  developments in the production of light by means of the Hertzian waves.    DIRECTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.--Electricity, however, is not a cheap  method of illumination. The enormous heat developed is largely wasted.  The quest of the inventor is to find a means whereby light can be  produced without the generation of the immense heat necessary.    Man has not yet found a means whereby he can make a heat without  increasing the temperature, as nature does it in the glow worm, or in  the firefly. A certain electric energy will produce both light and heat,  but it is found that much more of this energy is used in the heat than  in the light.    What wonderful possibilities are in store for the inventor who can make  a heatless light! It is a direction for the exercise of ingenuity that  will well repay any efforts.    _Curious Superstitions Concerning Electricity_    Electricity, as exhibited in light, has been the great marvel of all  times. The word electricity itself comes from the thunderbolt of the  ancient God Zeus, which is known to be synonymous with the thunderbolt  and the lightning.    Magnetism, which we know to be only another form of electricity, was not  regarded the same as electricity by the ancients. Iron which had the  property to attract, was first found near the town of Magnesia, in  Lydia, and for that reason was called magnetism.    Later on, a glimmer of the truth seemed to dawn on the early scientists,  when they saw the resemblance between the actions of the amber and the  loadstone, as both attracted particles. And here another curious thing  resulted. Amber will attract particles other than metals. The magnet did  not; and from this imperfect observation and understanding, grew a  belief that electricity, or magnetism would attract all substances, even  human flesh, and many devices were made from magnets, and used as cures  for the gout, and to affect the brain, or to remove pain."]]]
