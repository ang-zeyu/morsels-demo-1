[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23644"],[0,"Marjorie Dean, High School Freshman (#18)"],[1,"morning when the freshman team visited her in a body was a subject that  agitated high school circles for at least a week afterward. Other than  the team no one could furnish any authentic information as to what had  actually been said and done, but the amazing report that \"Miss Archer  had disbanded the freshman basketball team\" was on every one's tongue.  Whether or not another team would be selected no one knew. That would  depend wholly upon Miss Archer's decision. That the members of the team  had offended seriously there could be no doubt. As for the ex-members  themselves, they were absolutely mute on the subject. Among themselves,  however, they had a great deal to say, and, one and all, held Marjorie  Dean responsible for their downfall.    When Miss Archer had commanded their presence in her office that  eventful morning it was not in connection with the conflicting  statements of Ellen Seymour and Mignon La Salle. Satisfied that Mignon  was the real offender, she had read that young woman a lesson on  untruthfulness and treachery in the presence of the team that left her  white with mortification, her stormy black eyes alone betraying her  rage.    Then Miss Archer proceeded to the other business at hand, which was an  inquiry into their reason for requesting Marjorie Dean's resignation  from the team. One by one, the four girls, with the exception of Helen  Thornton, were questioned separately and acknowledged, in shamefaced  fashion, that Marjorie was a really good player.    \"Then why,\" Miss Archer had asked sharply, \"did you ask her to resign?\"  There had been no answer to this pertinent question, and then had  followed their principal's rebuke, sharp and stinging.    \"It is not often that I feel impelled to interfere in your games,\" she  had said. \"Not long since I refused to listen to something Miss Arnold  tried to tell me; but, when several heartless girls deliberately combine  to humiliate and discomfit a companion under the flimsy pretext of 'the  good of the team' it is time to call a halt. Four girls were prime  movers in this contemptible plan. One girl was an accessory, and  therefore equally guilty. In justice to the traditions of Sanford High  School the girl who has suffered at your hands, and in defense of my own  self-respect, these offenders must be punished. So I am going to  disband your team and forbid any one of you to play basketball again  until I am satisfied that you know something of the first principles of  honor and fair play. However, I shall not forbid basketball to the  freshmen. The innocent shall not suffer with the guilty. A new team will  be chosen which I trust will be a credit rather than a detriment to our  high school. You are dismissed.\"    Five girls, whose faces were an open indication of their chagrin, had  left the principal's office in a far more chastened frame of mind than  when they had entered it. Miss Archer's arraignment had been a most  unpleasant surprise, and in discussing it among themselves afterward,  Helen Thornton had caused Mignon to pour forth a torrent of biting words  by saying sulkily, that if Mignon had let Ellen Seymour alone everything  would have been all right.    \"Do you mean to say that you believe those miserable girls?\" Mignon had  cried out.    And Helen had answered with marked sarcasm, \"No; I believe what I saw  with my own eyes, and I wish I'd never heard of your old team. I'm  ashamed to think I ever listened to you,\" and had walked away from the  group with a sore and penitent heart, never to return to their circle  again.    All this was, of course, kept strictly secret by the other four  ex-members, who joined hands and vowed solemnly that they would weather  the gale together. The disbanding of the team by Miss Archer and Ellen  Seymour's vindication, could not be hushed up, however, and, despite  their protests that Miss Archer was unfair, and that the statements of  certain other girls were wholly unreliable, they lost ground with their  classmates.    Marjorie, too, had been made to feel the weight of their displeasure,  for they took pains to circulate the report that it was she who had told  tales to the principal, and thus brought them to grief. Several of the  sophomores, including Ellen Seymour, heatedly denied the rumor, and a  number of freshmen also took up the cudgels in her behalf. Jerry, Irma  and Constance stood firmly by her, and, although the poor little  lieutenant was far more hurt over the allegation than she would show,  she kept a brave face to the front and tried to ignore the ill-natured  thrusts launched chiefly by Muriel and Mignon.    But in the midst of this uncomfortable season Marjorie made a wonderful  discovery. It was quite by chance that she made it, and it concerned  Constance Stevens. Although the Mary girl had apparently grown very fond  of Marjorie and had almost entirely dropped her strange cloak of  reserve, she had never invited the girl who had so graciously befriended  her to her home.    From the words of vehement protest which Constance had spoken on that  day when Marjorie had followed her and protested that they become  friends, she had partly understood the other girl's position in regard  to her family, and had tactfully avoided the subject ever afterward. She  had talked the matter over with her captain, and they had decided to  respect Constance's reticence and keep religiously away from anything  bordering on the discussion of her family.    It was on a crisp November afternoon, several days before Thanksgiving,  that Marjorie made her discovery. As she walked into the living-room,  her books on her arm, her cheeks pink from the sharp, frosty air, her  mother hung up the telephone with: \"Marjorie, do you think Constance  would like to go with us to the theatre to-night? Your father has just  telephoned me that he has four tickets.\"    \"She'd love it. I know she would. I'll hurry straight down to her house  and ask her.\" Marjorie dropped her books on the table with a joyful  thump.    \"Very well; but I wish you would wait until I finish my letter, then you  can post it on your way there.\"    \"Did Nora bake chocolate cake to-day?\" asked Marjorie irrelevantly.    \"Yes.\"    There was a rush of light feet from the room. Three minutes later  Marjorie returned, a huge piece of chocolate layer cake in her hand.    \"It's the best ever,\" she declared between bites.    By the time the cake was eaten the letter was ready.    \"Hurry, dear,\" her mother called after her; \"we shall have an early  dinner.\"    It did not recur to Marjorie until within sight of the house where  Constance lived that she was an uninvited guest. What a queer-looking  little house it was! Long ago it had been painted a pale gray with white  trimmings, but now it was a dingy, hopeless color that defied  description. A child's dilapidated tricycle stood on the rickety porch,  which was approached by a flight of three unstable-looking steps.    Her mind centered upon her errand, Marjorie paid small attention to her  surroundings. She bounded up the steps, searching with alert eyes for a  bell. Finding none she doubled her fist to knock, but paused suddenly  with upraised arm. From within the house came the vibrant notes of a  violin mingled with the soft accompaniment of a piano.    \"Schubert's 'Serenade,'\" breathed Marjorie, delightedly, lowering her  arm. \"I simply must listen.\"    Suddenly a voice took up the plaintive strain. It was so high and sweet  and clear that the listener caught her breath in sheer amazement.    She stood spellbound, while the wonderful voice sang on and on to the  last note of the exquisite \"Serenade\" that seemed to end in a long-drawn  sigh.    Marjorie knocked lightly, but no one responded.    The singer had begun again. This time it was Nevin's \"Oh That We Two  Were Maying.\"    She listened again; then, to her surprise, the door was gently opened.  Before her stood the tiny figure of a boy whose great black eyes looked  curiously into hers. Laying his finger upon his lips, he gravely  motioned with his other hand for her to enter. Then as he limped away  from the door Marjorie saw he was a cripple.    Marjorie stepped noiselessly into the room, her eyes on the piano. A man  was seated before it. She could not see his face, but she noted that he  had an enormous shock of snow-white hair. At one side of him stood  another old man, his thin cheek resting lovingly against his violin, his  whole soul intent upon the flood of melody he was bringing forth, while  on the other side of the pianist, her quiet face fairly transfigured  stood Constance, pouring out her very heart in song.          CHAPTER XVI    THE PEOPLE OF THE LITTLE GRAY HOUSE      Intent upon their music, neither the singer nor the two men were  immediately aware of the presence of another person in the room.        \"Oh, that we two were lying      Under the churchyard sod,\"    sang Constance, voicing the pent-up longing of Kingsley's tenderly  regretful words and Nevin's wistful setting, while the violin sang a  subdued, pensive obligato.    Marjorie stood very still, her gaze fastened upon Constance. The quaint  little boy stared at Marjorie with an equally intent interest. Thus, as  Constance began the last line the earnest, compelling regard of the  brown eyes caused her own to be turned toward Marjorie.    \"Oh!\" she ejaculated in faltering surprise. \"Where--where did you come  from? What made you come here?\"    There was mingled amazement, consternation and embarrassment in the  question. The white-haired pianist swung round on his stool, and the old  man with the violin raised his head and regarded the unexpected visitor  out of two mildly inquiring blue eyes.    \"I'm sorry,\" began Marjorie, her cheeks hot with the shame of being  unwelcome. \"I suppose I ought not to have come, but----\"    Constance sprang to her side and catching her hands said contritely,  \"Forgive me, dear, and please don't feel "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23650"],[0,"Ten Boys from History (#18)"],[1,"affection even than before for  their little Colonel, and the Queen who had been present during the  whole scene spoke in friendly words of thanks to the boys, who then  withdrew, escorted by the king and the Dauphin, who had no knowledge,  child of destiny that he was, of the omen contained in that present.  But Marie Antoinette knew only too well, and her heart was heavy when  she saw the present made from the stones of the Bastile. But of this  she gave no sign, and from that day attempted more than ever to endear  herself and her son to the people who had so little trust in her. One  day when a crowd of fiendish women behind the fence called out cruel  things about the Queen, the Dauphin could be no longer silent.    \"You lie, oh, you lie!\" he cried angrily. \"My mamma is _not_ a wicked  woman, and she does not hate the people. She is good. She is so good  that--that----\" tears choked him, and ashamed to show such signs of  weakness, he dashed out of the garden into the palace, but as he  reached the queen's apartments he choked back the tears, saying, \"I  will not cry any more, for that will only trouble mamma and I can see  she has trouble enough without that. I will laugh and sing and jump  about, and then she may smile a little instead of crying, as I often  find her doing.\"    His tutor, the Abbe Davout, heartily approved of this, and the Dauphin  sprang into his mother's presence with a merry smile which gladdened  the queen's heart and made her forget her sorrows for awhile. This  pleased the Dauphin greatly, and he re-doubled his efforts to be merry,  making the little dog stand on its hind legs, while Louis put on its  black head a paper cap which he had made, painted with red stripes,  like those worn by the Jacobins or Revolutionists and cried:    \"Monsieur Jacobi, behave respectfully. Make your salutations to her  majesty, the Queen!\"    He was rewarded by a hug and a kiss from the Queen and then ran off  with the dog barking at his heels.    Little Louis was, as we have seen, an eager and brilliant scholar and  one day he begged the Abbe to give him lessons in grammar which he had  begun to learn some time before.    \"Gladly,\" answered the Abbe, \"your last lesson, if I remember rightly,  was upon the three degrees of comparison--the positive, the comparative  and the superlative. But you must have forgotten all that.\"    \"You are mistaken,\" answered the Dauphin, \"and I will prove it to you.  Listen:--the positive is when I say, 'my Abbe is a kind Abbe'; the  comparative is when I say 'my Abbe is kinder than another Abbe,' and  the superlative,\" he continued, looking at the Queen who was  listening--\"is when I say, 'mamma is the kindest and most amiable of  all mammas!'\"    The retort was so clever, the manner of saying it so charming, that the  Abbe and Marie Antoinette exchanged glances of amusement and pride, but  the little prince was unconscious of having said or done anything  unusual.    Besides grammar, Louis studied Italian, which he could speak and read  fluently; he also studied Latin, and some of the sentences he  translated have been preserved, such as \"True friends are useful to  princes.\" \"I know a prince who easily flies into a passion.\"  \"Flatterers are very dangerous to princes.\" From these sentences it is  evident that the Abbe was trying to teach his clever little scholar  more than one thing at a time. Louis was also taught arithmetic,  geometry and geography, this last by means of a huge hollow globe lit  by a lantern, which had been invented for the special use of the  Dauphin, by a celebrated professor in the University of Paris. Louis  also was trained in all sorts of athletic sports and when he was seven  years old was sturdy of body and far more mature of mind than many  older boys. At seven, according to the court custom of France, he was  obliged to be given into the care of a governor. The people wished to  choose this governor and named several candidates who were utterly  unworthy of the position, but they were obliged to set aside their  wishes and accept a man named by the king, who also himself continued  to superintend his son's education.    At this time the clouds of political disaster were again hanging over  the palace, and even the Dauphin could see and feel the uneasiness that  surrounded him.    On June 20, 1792, King Louis refused to sign two decrees which the  people wished him to sign, and with his refusal the storm of riot and  revolution burst forth again. An immense mob of shrieking, howling  people stormed the Tuileries, where no measures had been taken in  defence, and the king gave orders that the doors of the palace be flung  open and the people be allowed to pass in unhindered. In a few minutes  every inch of space in rooms and corridors and halls was filled with  the dense crowd. Only one room was locked, and in that room were the  king and queen, the Dauphin and his sister, Therese with a few loyal  friends. Therese was terrified and would have screamed with fright, but  the manly little Dauphin watching her, held back his own tears and kept  her terror under control by his words and manner, acting with the  dignity of a grown-up guardian.    Breathlessly, the little company gathered there listened to the sound  of an axe, doors were being battered down, the door of the royal  apartment was opened, and an officer of the National Guard knelt before  the King, beseeching him to show himself to the frenzied mob. The  expression on all faces, the sounds from without were too much for the  Dauphin's self-control. He burst into sobs and begged the queen to take  him to his room, and while Marie Antoinette was comforting him as best  she could, the king went out and stood in the middle of the hall,  surrounded by the rabble, speaking in quiet words, of his love for his  people. The crowd was delighted at this, but in the meantime, the still  greater crowd outside the palace surged through the hall and into the  room where the queen and her children were. The National Guards quickly  rolled a table up between the queen and the mob, and stood at either  side, ready to defend them. Only a table now separated the queen from  her enemies, but she was calm and courageous and stood proudly erect  with a child on either side of her, wide-eyed at the sights they saw.  Suddenly, the queen trembled with a deathly fear. Before her stood the  man whose brawny arm had reached through the paling to grasp the  Dauphin. Simon, the cobbler, stood there, hatred and desire for revenge  on his face, and Marie Antoinette knew with a quick instinct that this  man would bring no good to her child. Then the cries of the Jacobins  rent the air and they surged into the room with the fury of wild beasts  sure of their prey.    The queen lifted the Dauphin up and set him on a table and whispered to  him that he must not grieve or fear or cry, but be a man now, and the  child smiled and kissed her hand. Just then a drunken woman flung a red  cap--the cap worn by the Jacobins--on the table, and commanded the  queen, on pain of death, to put it on.    Calmly, the queen turned to a general standing beside her and told him  to place it on her head.    The general, pale with rage at the insult, obeyed in silence and the  woman howled with pleasure. But in a moment, the general took the cap  off the queen's hair and laid it on the table.    Ever since the King had vetoed the bills, the people had called the  King, Monsieur Veto; Marie Antoinette, Madame Veto, and the Dauphin,  Little Veto, and now from all sides burst forth the cry, \"The red cap  for the Dauphin! The tri-colour for little Veto!\"    \"If you love the nation,\" cried the woman to the Queen, \"put the red  cap on your son.\"    The Queen motioned to one of the ladies to put the red cap on the  child, and he, not understanding whether it was a joke or not, stood  there in easy grace, as handsome a little prince as ever a nation had.    One of the revolutionary leaders, who had looked complacently at the  scene, now stood near the queen, and as her eyes met his in calm  defiance, he felt a thrill of pity for her and for the little Dauphin,  and when he saw the perspiration rolling down the boy's forehead from  under the thick woollen cap, he called out roughly:    \"Take that cap off the child--don't you see how he sweats?\"    The queen's gratified glance thanked him, as she took the cap herself  from the Dauphin's head. While this was occurring, the Mayor of Paris  had entered the outer hall and was quieting the mob, bidding them  disband and leave the palace at once, which they did.    The King sank into a chair, exhausted and agonised, and cried out:    \"Where is the queen? Where are the children?\" and in a moment the royal  victims were together.    The Dauphin's spirits were never long cast down and now he was bubbling  over with joy.    \"Papa,\" he cried. \"Give me a kiss! I deserve it, for I was truly brave  and did not cry or even speak when the people put the red cap on my  head.\"    The king stooped with a dignity which was almost reverent, kissed the  boy's broad forehead and pushed back his thick golden hair, then turned  to answer a question put by one of the representatives of the people;  several of whom were in the room. And all at once these men gathered  around the little Dauphin, of whose brilliant mind they had heard so  much, and began to question him eagerly on all kinds of subjects,  especially about the boundaries of France, and its division into  departments and districts, and every question he answered quickly.  After each answer he glanced up at his mother inquiringly, and when her  face showed that he had answered correctly, his face beamed with  pleasure, and he enjoyed seeing the astonishment on those faces  crowding around him. One of those present asked:    \"Do you sing, too, Prince?\"    The Dauphin glanced again at the queen.    \"Mamma,\" he asked, \"shall I sing the prayer I sang this morning?"]]]
