If the ground is in some places more disposed to yield than  in others, the piers in those places will sink more than the rest, and  this distortion of the system will be probably of more importance in  pillars than in a wall, because the adjustment of the weight above is more  delicate; we thus actually want the _weight_ of the stones between the  pillars, in order that the whole foundation may be bonded into one, and  sink together if it sink at all: and the more massy the pillars, the  more we shall need to fill the intervals of their foundations. In the  best form of Greek architecture, the intervals are filled up to the root  of the shaft, and the columns have no independent base; they stand on  the even floor of their foundation.    Sec. VIII. Such a structure is not only admissible, but, when the column  is of great thickness in proportion to its height, and the sufficient  firmness, either of the ground or prepared floor, is evident, it is the  best of all, having a strange dignity in its excessive simplicity. It  is, or ought to be, connected in our minds with the deep meaning of  primeval memorial. \"And Jacob took the stone that he had put for his  pillow, and set it up for a pillar.\" I do not fancy that he put a base  for it first. If you try to put a base to the rock-piers of Stonehenge,  you will hardly find them improved; and two of the most perfect  buildings in the world, the Parthenon and Ducal palace of Venice, have  no bases to their pillars: the latter has them, indeed, to its upper  arcade shafts; and had once, it is said, a continuous raised base for  its lower ones: but successive elevations of St. Mark's Place have  covered this base, and parts of the shafts themselves, with an  inundation of paving stones; and yet the building is, I doubt not, as  grand as ever. Finally, the two most noble pillars in Venice, those  brought from Acre, stand on the smooth marble surface of the Piazzetta,  with no independent bases whatever. They are rather broken away beneath,  so that you may look under parts of them, and stand (not quite erect,  but leaning somewhat) safe by their own massy weight. Nor could any  bases possibly be devised that would not spoil them.    Sec. IX. But it is otherwise if the pillar be so slender as to look  doubtfully balanced. It would indeed stand quite as safely without an  independent base as it would with one (at least, unless the base be in  the form of a socket). But it will not appear so safe to the eye. And  here for the first time, I have to express and apply a principle, which  I believe the reader will at once grant,--that features necessary to  express security to the imagination, are often as essential parts of  good architecture as those required for security itself. It was said  that the wall base was the foot or paw of the wall. Exactly in the same  way, and with clearer analogy, the pier base is the foot or paw of the  pier. Let us, then, take a hint from nature. A foot has two offices, to  bear up, and to hold firm. As far as it has to bear up, it is uncloven,  with slight projection,--look at an elephant's (the Doric base of  animality);[36] but as far as it has to hold firm, it is divided and  clawed, with wide projections,--look at an eagle's.    Sec. X. Now observe. In proportion to the massiness of the column, we  require its foot to express merely the power of bearing up; in fact, it  can do without a foot, like the Squire in Chevy Chase, if the ground  only be hard enough. But if the column be slender, and look as if it  might lose its balance, we require it to look as if it had hold of the  ground, or the ground hold of it, it does not matter which,--some  expression of claw, prop, or socket. Now let us go back to Fig. XI., and  take up one of the bases there, in the state in which we left it. We may  leave out the two lower steps (with which we have nothing more to do, as  they have become the united floor or foundation of the whole), and, for  the sake of greater clearness, I shall not draw the bricks in the shaft,  nor the flat stone which carries them, though the reader is to suppose  them remaining as drawn in Fig. XI.; but I shall only draw the shaft and  its two essential members of base, Xb and Yb, as explained at p. 65,  above: and now, expressing the rounding of these numbers on _a_ somewhat  larger scale, we have the profile _a_, Fig. XII.; _b_, the perspective  appearance of such a base seen from above; and _c_, the plan of it.    Sec. XI. Now I am quite sure the reader is not satisfied of the stability  of this form as it is seen at _b_; nor would he ever be so with the main  contour of a circular base. Observe, we have taken some trouble to  reduce the member Yb into this round form, and all that we have gained  by so doing, is this unsatisfactory and unstable look of the base; of  which the chief reason is, that a circle, unless enclosed by right  lines, has never an appearance of fixture, or definite place,[37]--we  suspect it of motion, like an orb of heaven; and the second is, that the  whole base, considered as the foot of the shaft, has no grasp nor hold:  it is a club-foot, and looks too blunt for the limb,--it wants at least  expansion, if not division.    [Illustration: Fig. XII.]    Sec. XII. Suppose, then, instead of taking so much trouble with the  member Yb, we save time and labor, and leave it a square block. Xb must,  however, evidently follow the pillar, as its condition is that it slope  to the very base of the wall veil, and of whatever the wall veil  becomes. So the corners of Yb will project beyond the circle of Xb, and  we shall have (Fig. XII.) the profile _d_, the perspective appearance  _e_, and the plan _f_. I am quite sure the reader likes _e_ much better  than he did _b_. The circle is now placed, and we are not afraid of its  rolling away. The foot has greater expansion, and we have saved labor  besides, with little loss of space, for the interval between the bases  is just as great as it was before,--we have only filled up the corners  of the squares.    But is it not possible to mend the form still further? There is surely  still an appearance of separation between Xb and Yb, as if the one might  slip off the other. The foot is expanded enough; but it needs some  expression of grasp as well. It has no toes. Suppose we were to put a  spur or prop to Xb at each corner, so as to hold it fast in the centre  of Yb. We will do this in the simplest possible form. We will have the  spur, or small buttress, sloping straight from the corner of Yb up to  the top of Xb, and as seen from above, of the shape of a triangle.  Applying such spurs in Fig. XII., we have the diagonal profile at _g_,  the perspective _h_, and the plan _i_.    Sec. XIII. I am quite sure the reader likes this last base the best,  and feels as if it were the firmest. But he must carefully distinguish  between this feeling or imagination of the eye, and the real stability  of the structure. That this real stability has been slightly increased  by the changes between _b_ and _h_, in Fig. XII., is true. There is in  the base _h_ somewhat less chance of accidental dislocation, and  somewhat greater solidity and weight. But this very slight gain of  security is of no importance whatever when compared with the general  requirements of the structure. The pillar must be _perfectly_ secure,  and more than secure, with the base _b_, or the building will be unsafe,  whatever other base you put to the pillar. The changes are made, not for  the sake of the almost inappreciable increase of security they involve,  but in order to convince the eye of the real security which the base _b_  _appears_ to compromise. This is especially the case with regard to the  props or spurs, which are absolutely useless in reality, but are of the  highest importance as an expression of safety. And this will farther  appear when we observe that they have been above quite arbitrarily  supposed to be of a triangular form. Why triangular? Why should not the  spur be made wider and stronger, so as to occupy the whole width of the  angle of the square, and to become a complete expansion of Xb to the  edge of the square? Simply because, whatever its width, it has, in  reality, no supporting power whatever; and the _expression_ of support  is greatest where it assumes a form approximating to that of the spur or  claw of an animal. We shall, however, find hereafter, that it ought  indeed to be much wider than it is in Fig. XII., where it is narrowed in  order to make its structure clearly intelligible.    Sec. XIV. If the reader chooses to consider this spur as an aesthetic  feature altogether, he is at liberty to do so, and to transfer what we  have here said of it to the beginning of Chap. XXV. I think that its  true place is here, as an _expression_ of safety, and not a means of  beauty; but I will assume only, as established, the form _e_ of Fig.  XII., which is absolutely, as a construction, easier, stronger, and more  perfect than _b_. A word or two now of its materials. The wall base, it  will be remembered, was built of stones more neatly cut as they were  higher in place; and the members, Y and X, of the pier base, were the  highest members of the wall base gathered. But, exactly in proportion to  this gathering or concentration in form, should, if possible, be the  gathering or concentration of substance. For as the whole weight of the  building is now to rest upon few and limited spaces, it is of the  greater importance that it should be there received by solid masonry. Xb  and Yb are therefore, if possible, to be each of a single stone; or,  when the shaft is small, both cut out of one block, and especially if  spurs are to be added to Xb. The reader must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30755"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 2 (of 3), (#18)"],[1,"es, in ships of  small tonnage, and for the most part dependent for speed on the oar  rather than the sail. The labor and cost of carriage are just as great,  whether they import common or precious stone, and therefore the natural  tendency would always be to make each shipload as valuable as possible.  But in proportion to the preciousness of the stone, is the limitation of  its possible supply; limitation not determined merely by cost, but by  the physical conditions of the material, for of many marbles, pieces  above a certain size are not to be had for money. There would also be a  tendency in such circumstances to import as much stone as possible ready  sculptured, in order to save weight; and therefore, if the traffic of  their merchants led them to places where there were ruins of ancient  edifices, to ship the available fragments of them home. Out of this  supply of marble, partly composed of pieces of so precious a quality  that only a few tons of them could be on any terms obtained, and partly  of shafts, capitals, and other portions of foreign buildings, the island  architect has to fashion, as best he may, the anatomy of his edifice. It  is at his choice either to lodge his few blocks of precious marble here  and there among his masses of brick, and to cut out of the sculptured  fragments such new forms as may be necessary for the observance of fixed  proportions in the new building; or else to cut the colored stones into  thin pieces, of extent sufficient to face the whole surface of the  walls, and to adopt a method of construction irregular enough to admit  the insertion of fragmentary sculptures; rather with a view of  displaying their intrinsic beauty, than of setting them to any regular  service in the support of the building.    An architect who cared only to display his own skill, and had no respect  for the works of others, would assuredly have chosen the former  alternative, and would have sawn the old marbles into fragments in order  to prevent all interference with his own designs. But an architect who  cared for the preservation of noble work, whether his own or others',  and more regarded the beauty of his building than his own fame, would  have done what those old builders of St. Mark's did for us, and saved  every relic with which he was entrusted.    Sec. XXVII. But these were not the only motives which influenced the  Venetians in the adoption of their method of architecture. It might,  under all the circumstances above stated, have been a question with  other builders, whether to import one shipload of costly jaspers, or  twenty of chalk flints; and whether to build a small church faced with  porphyry and paved with agate, or to raise a vast cathedral in  freestone. But with the Venetians it could not be a question for an  instant; they were exiles from ancient and beautiful cities, and had  been accustomed to build with their ruins, not less in affection than in  admiration: they had thus not only grown familiar with the practice of  inserting older fragments in modern buildings, but they owed to that  practice a great part of the splendor of their city, and whatever charm  of association might aid its change from a Refuge into a Home. The  practice which began in the affections of a fugitive nation, was  prolonged in the pride of a conquering one; and beside the memorials of  departed happiness, were elevated the trophies of returning victory. The  ship of war brought home more marble in triumph than the merchant vessel  in speculation; and the front of St. Mark's became rather a shrine at  which to dedicate the splendor of miscellaneous spoil, than the  organized expression of any fixed architectural law, or religious  emotion.    Sec. XXVIII. Thus far, however, the justification of the style of this  church depends on circumstances peculiar to the time of its erection,  and to the spot where it arose. The merit of its method, considered in  the abstract, rests on far broader grounds.    In the fifth chapter of the \"Seven Lamps,\" Sec. 14, the reader will find  the opinion of a modern architect of some reputation, Mr. Wood, that the  chief thing remarkable in this church \"is its extreme ugliness;\" and he  will find this opinion associated with another, namely, that the works  of the Caracci are far preferable to those of the Venetian painters.  This second statement of feeling reveals to us one of the principal  causes of the first; namely, that Mr. Wood had not any perception of  color, or delight in it. The perception of color is a gift just as  definitely granted to one person, and denied to another, as an ear for  music; and the very first requisite for true judgment of St. Mark's, is  the perfection of that color-faculty which few people ever set  themselves seriously to find out whether they possess or not. For it is  on its value as a piece of perfect and unchangeable coloring, that the  claims of this edifice to our respect are finally rested; and a deaf man  might as well pretend to pronounce judgment on the merits of a full  orchestra, as an architect trained in the composition of form only, to  discern the beauty of St. Mark's. It possesses the charm of color in  common with the greater part of the architecture, as well as of the  manufactures, of the East; but the Venetians deserve especial note as  the only European people who appear to have sympathized to the full with  the great instinct of the Eastern races. They indeed were compelled to  bring artists from Constantinople to design the mosaics of the vaults of  St. Mark's, and to group the colors of its porches; but they rapidly  took up and developed, under more masculine conditions, the system of  which the Greeks had shown them the example: while the burghers and  barons of the North were building their dark streets and grisly castles  of oak and sandstone, the merchants of Venice were covering their  palaces with porphyry and gold; and at last, when her mighty painters  had created for her a color more priceless than gold or porphyry, even  this, the richest of her treasures, she lavished upon walls whose  foundations were beaten by the sea; and the strong tide, as it runs  beneath the Rialto, is reddened to this day by the reflection of the  frescoes of Giorgione.    Sec. XXIX. If, therefore, the reader does not care for color, I must  protest against his endeavor to form any judgment whatever of this  church of St. Mark's. But, if he both cares for and loves it, let him  remember that the school of incrusted architecture is _the only one in  which perfect and permanent chromatic decoration is possible_; and let  him look upon every piece of jasper and alabaster given to the architect  as a cake of very hard color, of which a certain portion is to be ground  down or cut off, to paint the walls with. Once understand this  thoroughly, and accept the condition that the body and availing strength  of the edifice are to be in brick, and that this under muscular power  of brickwork is to be clothed with the defence and the brightness of the  marble, as the body of an animal is protected and adorned by its scales  or its skin, and all the consequent fitnesses and laws of the structure  will be easily discernible: These I shall state in their natural order.    Sec. XXX. LAW I. _That the plinths and cornices used for binding the  armor are to be light and delicate._ A certain thickness, at least two or  three inches, must be required in the covering pieces (even when  composed of the strongest stone, and set on the least exposed parts), in  order to prevent the chance of fracture, and to allow for the wear of  time. And the weight of this armor must not be trusted to cement; the  pieces must not be merely glued to the rough brick surface, but  connected with the mass which they protect by binding cornices and  string courses; and with each other, so as to secure mutual support,  aided by the rivetings, but by no means dependent upon them. And, for  the full honesty and straight-forwardness of the work, it is necessary  that these string courses and binding plinths should not be of such  proportions as would fit them for taking any important part in the hard  work of the inner structure, or render them liable to be mistaken for  the great cornices and plinths already explained as essential parts of  the best solid building. They must be delicate, slight, and visibly  incapable of severer work than that assigned to them.    Sec. XXXI. LAW II. _Science of inner structure is to be abandoned._ As  the body of the structure is confessedly of inferior, and comparatively  incoherent materials, it would be absurd to attempt in it any expression  of the higher refinements of construction. It will be enough that by its  mass we are assured of its sufficiency and strength; and there is the  less reason for endeavoring to diminish the extent of its surface by  delicacy of adjustment, because on the breadth of that surface we are to  depend for the better display of the color, which is to be the chief  source of our pleasure in the building. The main body of the work,  therefore, will be composed of solid walls and massive piers; and  whatever expression of finer structural science we may require, will be  thrown either into subordinate portions of it, or entirely directed to  the support of the external mail, where in arches or vaults it might  otherwise appear dangerously independent of the material within.    Sec. XXXII. LAW III. _All shafts are to be solid._ Wherever, by the  smallness of the parts, we may be driven to abandon the incrusted  structure at all, it must be abandoned altogether. The eye must never be  left in the least doubt as to what is solid and what is coated. Whatever  appears _probably_ solid, must be _assuredly_ so, and therefore it  becomes an inviolable law that no shaft shall ever be incrusted. Not  only does the whole virtue of a shaft depend on its consolidation, but  the labor of cutting and"]]]
