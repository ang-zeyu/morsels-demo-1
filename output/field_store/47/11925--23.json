In cold weather,  the night before the day you dress it, bring it into a place of which  the temperature is not less than 45 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer.    The size of the boiling-pots should be adapted to what they are to  contain: the larger the saucepan the more room it takes upon the fire,  and a larger quantity of water requires a proportionate increase of fire  to boil it.        A little pot      Is soon hot.    In small families we recommend block tin saucepans, &c. as lightest and  safest. If proper care is taken of them, and they are well dried after  they are cleaned, they are by far the cheapest; the purchase of a new  tin saucepan being little more than the expense of tinning a copper one.    Let the covers of your boiling-pots fit close, not only to prevent  unnecessary evaporation of the water, but to prevent the escape of the  nutritive matter, which must then remain either in the meat or in the  broth; and the smoke is prevented from insinuating itself under the edge  of the lid, and so giving the meat a bad taste. See observations on  Saucepans, in chapter 7.    If you let meat or poultry remain in the water after it is done enough,  it will become sodden, and lose its flavour.    Beef and mutton a little _under_-done (especially very large joints,  which will make the better hash or broil,) is not a great fault; by some  people it is preferred: but lamb, pork, and veal are uneatable if not  thoroughly boiled; but do not _over_-do them.    A trivet or fish-drainer put on the bottom of the boiling-pot, raising  the contents about an inch and a half from the bottom, will prevent that  side of the meat which comes next the bottom from being done too much,  and the lower part of the meat will be as delicately done as the other  part; and this will enable you to take out the contents of the pot,  without sticking a fork, &c. into it. If you have not a trivet, use four  skewers, or a soup-plate laid the wrong side upwards.    Take care of the liquor you have boiled poultry or meat in; in five  minutes you may make it into excellent soup. (See obs. to No. 555 and  No. 229.)    The good housewife never boils a joint without converting the broth into  some sort of soup (read No. 5, and chapter 7). If the liquor be too  salt, only use half the quantity, and the rest water. Wash salted meat  well with cold water before you put it into the boiler.      _An estimation of the_ LOSS OF WEIGHT _which takes place in cooking     animal food._--_From_ Mr. TILLOCH'S _Philosophical Magazine._    \"It is well known, that in whatever way the flesh of animals is prepared  for food, a considerable diminution takes place in its weight. We do not  recollect, however, to have any where seen a statement of the loss which  meat sustains in the various culinary processes, although it is pretty  obvious that a series of experiments on the subject would not be without  their use in domestic economy.    \"We shall here give the result of a series of experiments which were  actually made on this subject in a public establishment; premising that,  as they were not undertaken from mere curiosity, but, on the contrary,  to serve a purpose of practical utility, absolute accuracy was not  attended to. Considering, however, the large quantities of provisions  which were actually examined, it is presumed that the results may be  safely depended upon for any practical purpose. It would, no doubt, have  been desirable to have known not only the whole diminution of weight,  but also the parts which were separated from the meat in the form of  aqueous vapour, jelly, fat, &c.; but the determination of these did not  fall within the scope of the inquiry.                                        _lbs._  _oz._    28 pieces of beef, weighing        280      0    Lost in boiling                     73     14    \"Hence, the weight lost by beef in boiling was in this case about  26-1/2lbs. in 100lbs.                                        _lbs._  _oz._    19 pieces of beef, weighing        190      0    Lost in roasting                    61      2    \"The weight lost by beef in roasting appears to be 32 per cent.                                        _lbs._  _oz._    9 pieces of beef, weighing          90      0    Lost in baking                      27      0    \"Weight lost by beef in baking 30 per cent.                                        _lbs._  _oz._    27 legs of mutton, weighing        260      0    Lost in boiling, and by having      the shank-bone taken off          62      4    \"The shank-bones were estimated at 4 ounces each; therefore the loss by  boiling was 55lbs. 8oz.    \"The loss of weight in legs of mutton in boiling is 21-1/3 per cent.                                        _lbs._  _oz._    35 shoulders of mutton, weighing   350      0    Lost in roasting                   109     10    \"The loss of weight in shoulders of mutton by roasting, is about 31-1/3  per cent.                                        _lbs._  _oz._    16 loins of mutton, weighing       141      0    Lost in roasting                    49     14    \"Hence, loins of mutton lose by roasting about 35-1/2 per cent.                                        _lbs._  _oz._    10 necks of mutton, weighing       100      0    Lost in roasting                    32      6    \"The loss in necks of mutton by roasting is about 32-1/3 per cent.    \"We shall only draw two practical inferences from the foregoing  statement.--1st, In respect of economy, it is more profitable to boil  meat than to roast it. 2dly, Whether we roast or boil meat, it loses by  being cooked from one-fifth to one-third of its whole weight.\"    The loss of roasting arises from the melting out of the fat, and  evaporating the water; but the nutritious matters remain condensed in  the cooked solid.    In boiling, the loss arises partly from the fat melted out, but chiefly  from _gelatine_ and _osmazome_ being extracted and dissolved by the  water in which the meat is boiled; there is, therefore, a real loss of  nourishment, unless the broth be used; when this mode of cooking becomes  the most economical.[71-*]      _The sauces usually sent to table with boiled meat, &c._    These are to be sent up in boats, and never poured over the meat, &c.

The following observations were written expressly for this work by Mr.  Turner, English and French bread and biscuit baker.    \"Baking is one of the cheapest and most convenient ways of dressing a  dinner in small families; and, I may say, that the oven is often the  only kitchen a poor man has, if he wishes to enjoy a joint of meat at  home with his family.    \"I don't mean to deny the superior excellence of roasting to baking; but  some joints, when baked, so nearly approach to the same when roasted,  that I have known them to be carried to the table, and eaten as such  with great satisfaction.    \"Legs and loins of pork, legs of mutton, fillets of veal, and many other  joints, will bake to great advantage, if the meat be good; I mean  well-fed, rather inclined to be fat: if the meat be poor, no baker can  give satisfaction.    \"When baking a poor joint of meat, before it has been half baked I have  seen it start from the bone, and shrivel up scarcely to be believed.    \"Besides those joints above mentioned, I shall enumerate a few baked  dishes which I can particularly recommend.    \"A pig, when sent to the baker prepared for baking, should have its ears  and tail covered with buttered paper properly fastened on, and a bit of  butter tied up in a piece of linen to baste the back with, otherwise it  will be apt to blister: with a proper share of attention from the baker,  I consider this way equal to a roasted one.    \"A goose prepared the same as for roasting, taking care to have it on a  stand, and when half done to turn the other side upwards. A duck the  same.    \"A buttock of beef the following way is particularly fine. After it has  been in salt about a week, to be well washed, and put into a brown  earthen pan with a pint of water; cover the pan tight with two or three  thicknesses of cap or foolscap paper: never cover any thing that is to  be baked with brown paper, the pitch and tar that is in brown paper will  give the meat a smoky, bad taste: give it four or five hours in a  moderately heated oven.    \"A ham (if not too old) put in soak for an hour, taken out and wiped, a  crust made sufficient to cover it all over, and baked in a moderately  heated oven, cuts fuller of gravy, and of a finer flavour, than a boiled  one. I have been in the habit of baking small cod-fish, haddock, and  mackerel, with a dust of flour, and some bits of butter put on them;  eels, when large and stuffed; herrings and sprats, in a brown pan, with  vinegar and a little spice, and tied over with paper. A hare, prepared  the same as for roasting, with a few pieces of butter, and a little drop  of milk put into the dish, and basted several times, will be found  nearly equal to roasting; or cut it up, season it properly, put it into  a jar or pan, and cover it over and bake it in a moderate oven for about  three hours. In the same manner, I have been in the habit of baking legs  and shins of beef, ox cheeks, &c. prepared with a seasoning of onions,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28693"],[0,"Tales of the Fish Patrol (#18)"],[1,"the mud to assure himself that the skiff was safe. This turned me in  the opposite direction. Half swimming, half wading, with my head just  out of water and avoiding splashing. I succeeded in putting about a  hundred feet between myself and the spot ashore where the Chinese had  begun to wade ashore from the junk. I drew myself out on the mud and  remained lying flat.    Again Yellow Handkerchief returned to the beach and made a search of  the island, and again he returned to the heap of clam-shells. I knew  what was running in his mind as well as he did himself. No one could  leave or land without making tracks in the mud. The only tracks to be  seen were those leading from his skiff and from where the junk had  been. I was not on the island. I must have left it by one or other of  those two tracks. He had just been over the one to his skiff, and was  certain I had not left that way. Therefore I could have left the  island only by going over the tracks of the junk landing. This he  proceeded to verify by wading out over them himself, lighting matches  as he came along.    When he arrived at the point where I had first lain, I knew, by the  matches he burned and the time he took, that he had discovered the  marks left by my body. These he followed straight to the water and  into it, but in three feet of water he could no longer see them. On  the other hand, as the tide was still falling, he could easily make  out the impression made by the junk's bow, and could have likewise  made out the impression of any other boat if it had landed at that  particular spot. But there was no such mark; and I knew that he was  absolutely convinced that I was hiding somewhere in the mud.    But to hunt on a dark night for a boy in a sea of mud would be like  hunting for a needle in a haystack, and he did not attempt it. Instead  he went back to the beach and prowled around for some time. I was  hoping he would give up and go, for by this time I was suffering  severely from the cold. At last he waded out to his skiff and rowed  away. What if this departure of Yellow Handkerchief's were a sham?  What if he had done it merely to entice me ashore?    The more I thought of it the more certain I became that he had made a  little too much noise with his oars as he rowed away. So I remained,  lying in the mud and shivering. I shivered till the muscles of the  small of my back ached and pained me as badly as the cold, and I had  need of all my self-control to force myself to remain in my miserable  situation.    It was well that I did, however, for, possibly an hour later, I  thought I could make out something moving on the beach. I watched  intently, but my ears were rewarded first, by a raspy cough I knew  only too well. Yellow Handkerchief had sneaked back, landed on the  other side of the island, and crept around to surprise me if I had  returned.    After that, though hours passed without sign of him, I was afraid to  return to the island at all. On the other hand, I was equally afraid  that I should die of the exposure I was undergoing. I had never  dreamed one could suffer so. I grew so cold and numb, finally, that I  ceased to shiver. But my muscles and bones began to ache in a way that  was agony. The tide had long since begun to rise, and, foot by foot,  it drove me in toward the beach. High water came at three o'clock, and  at three o'clock I drew myself up on the beach, more dead than alive,  and too helpless to have offered any resistence had Yellow  Handkerchief swooped down upon me.    But no Yellow Handkerchief appeared. He had given up and gone back to  Point Pedro. Nevertheless, I was in a deplorable, not to say a  dangerous, condition. I could not stand upon my feet, much less walk.  My clammy, muddy, garments clung to me like sheets of ice. I thought I  should never get them off. So numb and lifeless were my fingers, and  so weak was I, that it seemed to take an hour to get off my shoes. I  had not the strength to break the porpoise-hide laces, and the knots  defied me. I repeatedly beat my hands upon the rocks to get some sort  of life into them. Sometimes I felt sure I was going to die.    But in the end,--after several centuries, it seemed to me,--I got off  the last of my clothes. The water was now close at hand, and I crawled  painfully into it and washed the mud from my naked body. Still, I  could not get on my feet and walk and I was afraid to lie still.  Nothing remained but to crawl weakly, like a snail, and at the cost of  constant pain, up and down the island. I kept this up as along as  possible, but as the east paled with the coming of dawn I began to  succumb. The sky grew rosy-red, and the golden rim of the sun, showing  above the horizon, found me lying helpless and motionless among the  clam-shells.    As in a dream, I saw the familiar mainsail of the _Reindeer_ as she  slipped out of San Rafael Creek on a light puff of morning air. This  dream was very much broken. There are intervals I can never recollect  on looking back over it. Three things, however, I distinctly remember:  the first sight of the _Reindeer's_ mainsail; her lying at anchor a  few hundred feet away and a small boat leaving her side; and the cabin  stove roaring red-hot, myself swathed all over with blankets, except  on the chest and shoulders, which Charley was pounding and mauling  unmercifully, and my mouth and throat burning with the coffee which  Neil Partington was pouring down a trifle too hot.    But burn or no burn, I tell you it felt good. By the time we arrived  in Oakland I was as limber and strong as ever,--though Charley and  Neil Partington were afraid I was going to have pneumonia, and Mrs.  Partington, for my first six months of school, kept an anxious eye  upon me to discover the first symptoms of consumption.    Time flies. It seems but yesterday that I was a lad of sixteen on the  fish patrol. Yet I know that I arrived this very morning from China,  with a quick passage to my credit, and master of the barkentine  _Harvester_. And I know that to-morrow morning I shall run over to  Oakland to see Neil Partington and his wife and family, and later on  up to Benicia to see Charley Le Grant and talk over old times. No; I  shall not go to Benicia, now that I think about it. I expect to be a  highly interested party to a wedding, shortly to take place. Her name  is Alice Partington, and, since Charley has promised to be best man,  he will have to come down to Oakland instead."]]]
