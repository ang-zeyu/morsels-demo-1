Bruce the traveller, in speaking of these horns, says, \"The animal  furnishing these monstrous horns is a cow or bull which would be  considered of a middling size in England. This extraordinary size of its  horns proceeds from a disease that the cattle have in these countries,  of which they die, and is probably derived from their pasture and  climate. When the animal shows symptoms of this disorder, he is set  apart in the very best and quietest grazing place, and never driven or  molested from that moment. His value lies then in his horns, for his  body becomes emaciated and lank, in proportion as the horns grow large;  at the last period of his life, the weight of his head is so great that  he is unable to lift it up, or at least for any space of time. The  joints of his neck become callous at last, so that it is not any longer  in his power to lift his head. In this situation he dies, with scarcely  flesh to cover his bones, and it is then his horns are of the greatest  value. I have seen horns that would contain as much as a common sized  water-pail, such as they make use of in the houses in England.\"[B]    So far Mr. Bruce. Mr. Salt, who visited Abyssinia some years afterwards,  gives a somewhat different account. He says: \"Here [_i. e._ at Gibba],  for the first time, I was gratified by the sight of the Galla Oxen, or  Sanga, celebrated throughout Abyssinia for the remarkable size of its  horns. Three of these animals were grazing among the other cattle in  perfect health, which circumstance, together with the testimony of the  natives, 'that the size of the horns is in no instance occasioned by  disease,' completely refutes the fanciful theory given by Mr. Bruce  respecting this creature. It appears by the papers annexed to the last  edition of Mr. Bruce's work, that he never met with the Sanga; but that  he made many attempts to procure specimens of the horns, through Yanni,  a Greek, residing at Adowa. This old man very correctly speaks of them,  in his letters, as being only brought by the Cafilas from Antalo; and I  have now ascertained that they are sent to this country as valuable  presents, by the chiefs of the Galla, whose tribes are spread to the  southward of Enderta. So far, then, as to the description of the horns,  and the purposes to which they are applied by the Abyssinians, Mr.  Bruce's statements may be considered as correct; but with respect to  'the disease which occasions their size, probably derived from their  pasture and climate,' 'the care taken of them to encourage this  disease,' 'the emaciation of the animal,' and 'the extending of the  disorder to the spine of the neck, which at last becomes callous, so  that it is not any longer in the power of the animal to lift its head,'  they all prove to be mere ingenious conjectures, thrown out by the  author solely for the exercise of his own ingenuity.    \"I should not venture to speak so positively upon this matter, had I  not indisputably ascertained the facts; for the Ras having subsequently  made me a present of three of these animals alive, I found them not only  in excellent health, but so exceedingly wild, that I was obliged to have  them shot. The horns of one of these are now deposited in the Museum of  the Surgeons' College, and a still larger pair are placed in the  collection of Lord Valentia, at Arley Hall. The length of the largest  horn of this description was nearly four feet, and its circumference at  the base twenty-one inches.    \"It might have been expected that the animal, carrying horns of so  extraordinary a magnitude, would have proved larger than others  belonging to the same genus; but in every instance which came under my  observation, this was by no means the case. The etching on the following  page, which was copied from an original sketch (taken from the life),  may serve to convince the reader of this fact; and it will convey a  better idea of the animal than any description in writing I can pretend  to give. I shall only further observe, that its colour appeared to vary  as much as in the other species of its genus, and that the peculiarity  of the size of the horns was not confined to the male, the female being  very amply provided with this ornamental appendage to her forehead.\"    Notwithstanding the bold and confident tone of Mr. Salt's  counter-statement, it must be confessed, that the figure which he  himself gives from the life (and of which the frontispiece to this  volume is an exact copy), seems rather to coincide with Mr. Bruce's  account, being, to all appearance, both \"lank and emaciated.\"    Engraving of the horns presented by Mr. Salt to the  Museum of the College of Surgeons.

This  may possibly be the fact; but we have no proof whatever that it is so:  no information on this point has been presented beyond mere conjecture.  This being the case, and in the absence of direct anatomical evidence,  we may be pardoned in considering it, at least, as doubtful; especially  as there are so many points of external dissimilarity. The principal  differences are: 1st, in the shoulder, upon which there is a hump; 2d,  in the back, which descends (as in the Buffaloes and Zebus), abruptly  towards the tail; 3d, in the greater length of the legs; and 4th, in the  forehead, which is only three inches and a half between the bases of the  horns, whilst in the Common Ox it is nine inches.    The horns represented in the following sketch, are those of the  Hungarian Ox (a variety of _Bos Taurus_), and are almost as remarkable  for their length and expansion as those of the Abyssinian Sanga. The  length of each horn is three feet four inches and a half, and the  distance between the tips is five feet one inch. The sketch is from a  specimen in the British Museum.    [Illustration]    FOOTNOTES:    [B] Jerom Lobo, in his account of Abyssinia, mentions that some of the  horns of the Buffaloes of that country will hold ten quarts.          INDIAN DOMESTIC CATTLE.    _Bos ----?_          THE ZEBU, OR BRAHMIN OX.--(_Var. alpha._)      [Illustration]    The opinions expressed in the following extract from Mr. Bennett's  description of the Indian Ox (Gardens and Menag. of the Zool. Soc.), may  be taken as a correct exposition of the views of naturalists generally  on the subject:--    \"There can be little doubt that the Zebu, or Indian Ox, is merely a  variety of the Common Ox, although it is difficult to ascertain the  causes by which the distinctive characters of the two races have been in  the process of time gradually produced. But whatever the causes may  have been, their effects rapidly disappear by the intermixture of the  breeds, and are entirely lost at the end of a few generations. This  intermixture and its results would alone furnish a sufficient proof of  identity of origin; which, consequently, scarcely requires the  confirmation to be derived from the perfect agreement of their internal  structure, and of all the more essential particulars of their external  confirmation. These, however, are not wanting; not only is their  anatomical structure the same, but the form of their heads, which  affords the only certain means of distinguishing the actual species of  this genus from each other, presents no difference whatever. In both the  forehead is flat, or more properly slightly depressed; nearly square in  its outline, its height being equal to its breadth; and bounded above by  a prominent line, forming an angular protuberance, passing directly  across the skull between the bases of the horns. The only circumstances  in fact in which the two animals differ, consists in the fatty hump on  the shoulders of the Zebu, and in the somewhat more slender and delicate  make of its legs.\"    In a scientific work, it is not sufficient for the author merely to make  an assertion; it is not even sufficient for him to say that he has made  an experiment or observation, and merely give the result; he should, in  every case where it is practicable, describe the nature of his  experiment,--the _when_, the _where_, the _how_;--and the means and  opportunity he had of making his observations, that the curious or  sceptical inquirer may be enabled to perform the experiment, or make the  observation for himself.    Mr. Bennett tells us, that the differences observable in the Indian Ox  and the Common Ox \"_rapidly_ disappear by the intermixture of the  breeds, and are entirely lost at the end of a few generations;\" but he  does not refer to a single instance of this, authentic or otherwise; nor  are we aware that any such instance ever occurred.    Again, he states that \"their anatomical structure is the same;\" but he  does not inform us when, or where, or how, the comparison was made which  enabled him to arrive at that conclusion.    Wishing to satisfy myself, as far as possible, on this point, I have  examined the skeleton both of the British Domestic Ox and the Zebu; and  the following is the result of that examination:--                          NUMBER OF VERTEBRAE.
