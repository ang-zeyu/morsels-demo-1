During those three centuries, America, which had not been discovered  till six years after Bartholomew Diaz passed the Cape of Good Hope, had  been, all except a part of the north-west, pretty thoroughly explored  and partitioned out among five European powers. Large and prosperous  colonies had sprung up and before the end of the eighteenth century one  great independent state had established itself. The discovery of  Australia and New Zealand came much later than that of America; but  within one century from the first European settlement in Australia (A.D.  1787) the whole continent, though its interior is uninviting, had been  traversed along many lines, and five prosperous European colonies had  grown to importance. The slow progress of exploration and settlement in  South Africa during so long a period is therefore a noteworthy  phenomenon which deserves a few observations.    As regards the Portuguese part of the East African coast, the  explanation just given is sufficient. As regards that part of the West  coast which lies south of the Portuguese colony of Angola, the natural  features of the country make no explanation needed. No more arid or  barren coast is to be found anywhere, and in its whole long stretch  there is but one tolerable port, that of Walfish Bay. The inland region  is scarcely better. Much of it is waterless and without herbage. No gold  nor ivory nor other article of value was obtainable. Accordingly, nobody  cared to settle or explore, and the land would probably be still lying  unclaimed had not the settlement of Herr Luederitz and a vague desire  for territorial expansion prompted Germany to occupy it in 1884.    The south coast, from the Cape to the Tugela River, was much more  attractive. Here the climate was salubrious, the land in many places  fertile, and everywhere fit for sheep or cattle. Here, accordingly, a  small European community, first founded in 1652, grew up and spread  slowly eastward and northward along the shore during the century and a  half from its first establishment. The Dutch settlers did not care to  penetrate the interior, because the interior seemed to offer little to a  farmer. Behind the well-watered coast belt lay successive lines of steep  mountains, and behind those mountains the desert waste of the Karroo,  where it takes six acres to keep a sheep. Accordingly, it was only a few  bold hunters, a few farmers on the outskirts of the little maritime  colony, and a few missionaries, who cared to enter this wide wilderness.    When exploration began, it began from this south-west corner of Africa.  It began late. In 1806, when the British took the Cape from the Dutch,  few indeed were the white men who had penetrated more than one hundred  miles from the coast, and the farther interior was known only by report.  For thirty years more progress was slow; and it is within our own time  that nearly all the exploration, and the settlement which has followed  quickly on the heels of exploration, has taken place. Just sixty years  ago the Dutch Boers passed in their heavy waggons from Cape Colony to  the spots where Bloemfontein and Pretoria now stand. In 1854-56 David  Livingstone made his way through Bechuanaland to the falls of the  Zambesi and the west coast at St. Paul de Loanda. In 1889 the vast  territories between the Transvaal Republic and the Zambesi began to be  occupied by the Mashonaland pioneers. All these explorers, all the  farmers, missionaries, hunters, and mining prospectors, came up into  South Central Africa from the south-west extremity of the continent  over the great plateau. They moved north-eastward, because there was  more rain, and therefore more grass and game in that direction than  toward the north. They were checked from time to time by the warlike  native tribes; but they were drawn on by finding everywhere a country in  which Europeans could live and thrive. It was the existence of this high  and cool plateau that permitted their discoveries and encouraged their  settlement. And thus the rich interior has come to belong, not to the  Portuguese, who first laid hold of South Africa, but to the races who  first entered the plateau at the point where it is nearest the sea, the  Dutch and the English. Coming a thousand miles by land, they have seized  and colonised the country that lies within sixty or eighty miles of the  ocean behind the Portuguese settlements, because they had good healthy  air to breathe during all those thousand miles of journey; while the  Portuguese, sunk among tropical swamps, were doing no more than maintain  their hold upon the coast, and were allowing even the few forts they had  established along the lower course of the Zambesi to crumble away.    The same natural conditions, however, which have made the plateau  healthy, have kept it sparsely peopled. Much of this high interior,  whose settlement has occupied the last sixty years, is a desert unfit,  and likely to be always unfit, for human habitation. Even in those parts  which are comparatively well watered, the grazing for sheep and cattle  is so scanty during some months of the year that farms are large, houses  are scattered far from one another, and the population remains extremely  thin. The Wilderness of the Karroo cuts off Cape Town and its  comparatively populous neighbourhood from the inhabited, though thinly  inhabited, pastoral districts of the Orange Free State. Between these  two settled districts there are only a few villages, scattered at  intervals of many miles along a line of railway four hundred miles in  length. In the Free State and the Transvaal the white population is  extremely sparse, save in the mining region of the Witwatersrand,  because ranching requires few hands, and only a few hundred square miles  out of many thousands have been brought under cultivation. Thus, while  the coolness of the climate has permitted Europeans to thrive in these  comparatively low latitudes, its dryness has kept down their numbers and  has retarded not only their political development, but their progress in  all those arts and pursuits which imply a tolerably large and varied  society. The note of South African life, the thing that strikes the  traveller with increasing force as he visits one part of the country  after another, is the paucity of inhabitants, and the isolated life  which these inhabitants, except in six or seven towns, are forced to  lead. This is the doing of nature. She has not severed the country into  distinct social or political communities by any lines of physical  demarcation, but she has provided such scanty means of sustenance for  human life and so few openings for human industry unaided by capital,  that the settlers (save where capital has come to their aid) remain few  indeed, and one may call the interior of South Africa a vast solitude,  with a few oases of population dotted here and there over it.          CHAPTER VII    ASPECTS OF SCENERY      The sketch I have given of the physical character of South Africa will  doubtless have conveyed to the reader that the country offers  comparatively little to attract the lover of natural scenery. This  impression is true if the sort of landscape we have learned to enjoy in  Europe and in the eastern part of the United States be taken as the type  of scenery which gives most pleasure. Variety of form, boldness of  outline, the presence of water in lakes and running streams, and, above  all, foliage and verdure, are the main elements of beauty in those  landscapes; while if any one desires something of more imposing  grandeur, he finds it in snow-capped mountains like the Alps or the  Cascade Range, or in majestic crags such as those which tower over the  fiords of Norway. But the scenery of South Africa is wholly unlike that  of Europe or of most parts of America. It is, above all things, a dry  land, a parched and thirsty land, where no clear brooks murmur through  the meadow, no cascade sparkles from the cliff, where mountain and plain  alike are brown and dusty except during the short season of the rains.  And being a dry land, it is also a bare land. Few are the favoured spots  in which a veritable forest can be seen; for though many tracts are  wooded, the trees are almost always thin and stunted. In Matabililand,  for instance, though a great part of the surface is covered with wood,  you see no trees forty feet high, and few reaching thirty; while in the  wilderness of the Kalahari Desert and Damaraland nothing larger than a  bush is visible, except the scraggy and thorny mimosa.    These features of South Africa--the want of water and the want of  greenness--are those to which a native of Western Europe finds it  hardest to accustom himself, however thoroughly he may enjoy the  brilliant sun and the keen dry air which go along with them. And it must  also be admitted that over very large areas the aspects of nature are so  uniform as to become monotonous. One may travel eight hundred miles and  see less variety in the landscape than one would find in one-fourth of  the same distance anywhere in Western Europe or in America east of the  Alleghany Mountains. The same geological formations prevail over wide  areas, and give the same profile to the hilltop, the same undulations to  the plain; while in travelling northward toward the Equator the flora  seems to change far less between 34 deg. and 18 deg. south latitude than it  changes in the journey from Barcelona to Havre, through only half as  many degrees of latitude.    There are, nevertheless, several interesting bits of scenery in South  Africa, which, if they do not of themselves repay the traveller for so  long a journey, add sensibly to his enjoyment. The situation of Cape  Town, with a magnificent range "]]]
