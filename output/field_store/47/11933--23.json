But as the joy was unspeakable,  and the hopes lively, which from the fountaines of your Majesties favour  did fill our hearts, so were we not a little troubled, when wee did  perceive that your Majesties Commissioner, as before our meeting, he did  endevour a prelimitation of the Assembly in the necessarie Members  thereof, and the matters to bee treated therein, contrarie to the  intention of your Majesties Proclamation indicting a free Assembly  according to the order of this Kirk, and laws of the Kingdome: So from the  first beginnings of our sitting (as if his Lordship had come rather to  crosse, nor to countenance our lawful proceedings, or as we had intended  any prejudice to the good of Religion), or to your Majesties honour (which  GOD knoweth was far from our thoughts) did suffer nothing, although most  necessarie, most ordinarie, and most undenyable, to passe without some  censure, contradiction, or protestation: And after some dayes debating of  this kinde, farre against our expectation, and to our great griefe, did  arise himself, commanded us, who had laboured in every thing to approve  our selves to GOD, and to his Lordship, as representing your Majesties  Person, to arise also, and prohibited our further meeting by such a  proclamation, as will be found to have proceeded, rather from an  unwillingnesse that we should any longer sit, then from any ground or  reason, which may endure the tryal either of your Majesties Parliament, or  of your own royall Judgement, unto which if (being conveened by indiction  from your Majestie, and sitting now in a constitute Assembly) we should  have given place, This Kirk and Kingdome, contrare to your Majesties most  laudable intentions manifested in former proclamations, and contrarie to  the desires and expectation of all your Majesties good people, had been in  an instant precipitate in such a world of confusions, and such depths of  miserie, as afterward could not easily have been cured. In this  extreamitie we made choise rather of that course which was most agreeable  to your Majesties Will revealed unto us, after so many fervent  Supplications, and did most conduce for the good of Religion, your  Majesties honour, and the well of your Majesties Kingdome; then to give  way to any sudden motion, tending to the ruin of all: wherein wee are so  far from fearing the light, least our deeds should be reproved, that the  more accuratly that we are tryed, and the more impartially our using of  that power, which God Almighty, and your sacred Majestie, his Vicegerent  had put in our hands, for so good and necessarie ends, is examined, we  have the greater confidence, of your Majesties allowance and ratihabition:  and so much the rather, that being in a manner inhibited to proceed in so  good a work, we doubled our diligence, and endevoured more carefully then  before, when your Majesties _Commissioner_ was present, in every point,  falling under our consideration, to walke circumspectly, and without  offence, as in the sight of God, and as if your Majesties eyes had been  looking upon us, labouring to proceed according to the word of God, our  confession of Faith, and nationall oath, and the laudable constitutions of  the lawfull Assemblies of this Kirk; and studying rather to renew, and  revive old acts made for the reformation of Religion, in the time of your  Majesties Father, of happie memorie, and extant in the records of the  Kirk, which divine providence hath preserved, and at this time brought to  our hands; then either to allow of such novations, as the avarice and  ambition of men, abusing authoritie for their own ends, had without order  introduced; or to appoint any new order, which had not been formerly  received, and sworn to be reteined, in this Kirk. In all which the members  of the Assembly, found so clear and convincing light, to their full  satisfaction, against all their doubts and difficulties, that the harmonie  and unanimitie was rare and wonderfull, and that we could not have agreed  upon other constitutions, except wee would have been found fighting  against GOD. Your Majesties wise and princely minde knoweth, that nothing  is more ordinary then for men, when they doe well, to bee evil spoken of,  and that the best actions of men are many times misconstrued, and  mis-reported. _Balaam_, although a false Prophet, was wronged: for in  place of that which hee said, _The Lord refuseth to give me leave to go  with you:_ the princes of _Moab_ reported unto _Balack_, that _Balaam_  refused to goe with them. But our comfort is, That Truth is the daughter  of time, and although calumnie often starteth first, and runneth before,  yet Veritie followeth her at the heels, and possesseth her self in noble  and royall hearts: where base calumnie cannot long finde place. And our  confidence is, that your Majestie with that worthie King, will keep one  eare shut against all the obloquies of men; and with that more wise King,  who when he gave a proofe that the wisedome of GOD was in him to doe  judgement, would have both parties to stand before him at once: that  hearing them equally, they might speed best, and go out most chearfully "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2897"],[0,"The Sequel of Appomattox: A Chronicle of the Reunion of the States (#18)"],[1,"ats. With their eighty-five  representatives and a slight reaction in the North, they might gain  control of the lower House of Congress. The Union-Republican party had  a majority of less than one hundred in 1866, and this was lessened  slightly in the Fortieth Congress. The President was for all practical  purposes a Democrat again. The prospect was too much for the very human  politicians to view without distress. Stevens, speaking in support of  the Military Reconstruction Bill, said:    \"There are several good reasons for the passage of this bill. In  the first place, it is just. I am now confining my argument to Negro  suffrage in the rebel states. Have not loyal blacks quite as good a  right to choose rulers and make laws as rebel whites? In the second  place, it is necessary in order to protect the loyal white men in the  seceded states. With them the blacks would act in a body, and it is  believed that in each of these states, except one, the two united would  form a majority, control the states, and protect themselves. Now they  are the victims of daily murder. They must suffer constant persecution  or be exiled. Another good reason is that it would insure the ascendancy  of the union party.... I believe... that on the continued ascendancy  of that party depends the safety of this great nation. If impartial  suffrage is excluded in the rebel states, then every one of them is  sure to send a solid rebel electoral vote. They, with their kindred  Copperheads of the North, would always elect the President and control  Congress.\"    The laws passed on the 2d and the 23d of March were war measures and  presupposed a continuance of war conditions. The Lincoln-Johnson state  governments were overturned; Congress fixed the qualifications of voters  for that time and for the future; and the President, shorn of much of  his constitutional power, could exercise but little control over  the military government. Nothing that a state might do would secure  restoration until it should ratify the Fourteenth Amendment to the  Federal Constitution. The war had been fought upon the theory that the  old Union must be preserved; but the basic theory of the reconstruction  was that a new Union was to be created.        CHAPTER VI. THE RULE OF THE MAJOR GENERALS    From the passage of the reconstruction acts to the close of Johnson's  Administration, Congress, working the will of the radical majority, was  in supreme control. The army carried out the will of Congress and  to that body, not to the President, the commanding general and his  subordinates looked for direction.    The official opposition of the President to the policy of Congress  ceased when that policy was enacted into law. He believed this  legislation to be unconstitutional, but he considered it his duty to  execute the laws. He at once set about the appointment of generals to  command the military districts created in the South,* a task calling for  no little discretion, since much depended upon the character of these  military governors, or \"satraps,\" as they were frequently called by the  opposition. The commanding general in a district was charged with many  duties, military, political, and administrative. It was his duty  to carry on a government satisfactory to the radicals and not too  irritating to the Southern whites; at the same time he must execute the  reconstruction acts by putting old leaders out of power and Negroes  in. Violent opposition to this policy on the part of the South was not  looked for. Notwithstanding the \"Southern outrage\" campaign, it was  generally recognized in government circles that conditions in the  seceded states had gradually been growing better since the close of  the war. There was in many regions, to be sure, a general laxity in  enforcing laws, but that had always been characteristic of the newer  parts of the South. The Civil Rights Act was generally in force,  the \"Black Laws\" had been suspended, and the Freedmen's Bureau was  everywhere caring for the Negroes. What disorder existed was of recent  origin and in the main was due to the unsettling effects of the debates  in Congress and to the organization of the Negroes for political  purposes.         * The first five generals appointed were Schofield, Sickles.       Pope, Ord, and Sheridan. None of these remained in his       district until reconstruction was completed. To Schofield's       command in the first district succeeded in turn Stoneman,       Webb, and Canby; Sickles gave way to Canby, and Pope to       Meade; Ord in the fourth district was followed by Gillem,       McDowell, and Ames; Sheridan, in the fifth, was succeeded by       Griffen, Mower, Hancock, Buchanan, Reynolds, and Canby. Some       of the generals were radical; others, moderate and tactful.       The most extreme were Sheridan, Pope, and Sickles. Those       most acceptable to the whites were Hancock, Schofield, and       Meade. General Grant himself became more radical in his       actions as he became involved in the fight between Congress       and the President.      Military rule was established in the South with slight friction, but it  was soon found that the reconstruction laws were not sufficiently clear  on two points: first, whether there was any limit to the authority  of the five generals over the local and state governments and, if so,  whether the limiting authority was in the President; and second, whether  the disfranchising provisions in the laws were punitive and hence to  be construed strictly. Attorney-General Stanbery, in May and June  1867, drew up opinions in which he maintained that the laws were to  be considered punitive and therefore to be construed strictly. After  discussions in cabinet meetings, these opinions received the approval of  all except Stanton, Secretary of War, who had already joined the radical  camp. The Attorney-General's opinion was sent out to the district  commanders for their information and guidance. But Congress did not  intend to permit the President or his Cabinet to direct the process  of reconstruction, and in the Act of July 19, 1867, it gave a radical  interpretation to the reconstruction legislation, declared itself in  control, gave full power to General Grant and to the district commanders  subject only to Grant, directed the removal of all local officials who  opposed the reconstruction policies, and warned the civil and military  officers of the United States that none of them should \"be bound in his  action by any opinion of any civil officer of the United States.\" This  interpretive legislation gave a broad basis for the military government  and resulted in a severe application of the disfranchising provisions of  the laws.    The rule of the five generals lasted in all the States until June 1868,  and continued in Mississippi, Texas, Virginia, and Georgia until 1870.  There had been, to be sure, some military government in 1865, subject,  however, to the President, and from 1865 to 1867 the army, along with  the Freedmen's Bureau, had exerted a strong influence in the government  of the South, but in the regime now inaugurated the military was  supreme. The generals had a superior at Washington, but whether it was  the President, General Grant, or Congress was not clear until the Act of  July 19, 1867 made Congress the source of authority.    The power of the generals most strikingly appeared in their control of  the state governments which were continued as provisional organizations.  Since no elections were permitted, all appointments and removals were  made from military headquarters, which soon became political beehives,  centers of wirepulling and agencies for the distribution of spoils. At  the outset civil officers were ordered to retain their offices during  good behavior, subject to military control. But no local official was  permitted to use his influence ever so slightly against reconstruction.  Since most of them did not favor the policy of Congress, thousands were  removed as \"obstacles to reconstruction.\" The Governors of Georgia,  Louisiana, Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas were displaced and others  appointed in their stead. All kinds of subordinate offices rapidly  became vacant. New appointments were nearly always carpetbaggers  and native radicals who could take the \"ironclad\" oath. The generals  complained that there were not enough competent native \"loyalists\"  to fill the offices, and frequently an army officer was installed as  governor, treasurer, secretary of state, auditor, or mayor. In nearly  all towns, the police force was reorganized, and former Federal soldiers  were added to the force, while the regular troops were used for general  police purposes and for rural constabulary.    Over the administration of justice the military authorities exercised a  close supervision. Instructions were sent out to court officers covering  the selection of juries, the suspension of certain laws, and the rules  of evidence and procedure. Courts were often closed, court decrees set  aside or modified, prisoners released, and many cases reserved for trial  by military commission. Some commanders required juries to admit Negro  members and insisted that all jurors take the \"ironclad\" test oath.  There was some attempt at regulating the Federal courts but without much  success.    Since the state legislatures were forbidden to meet, much legislation  was enacted through military orders. Stay laws were enacted, the color  line was abolished, new criminal regulations were promulgated, and the  police power was invoked in some instances to justify sweeping measures,  such as the prohibition of whisky manufacture in North Carolina and  South Carolina. The military governors levied, increased, or decreased  taxes and made appropriations which the state treasurers were forced to  pay, but they restrained the radical conventions, all of which wished to  spend much money.
