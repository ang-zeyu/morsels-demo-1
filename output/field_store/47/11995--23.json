This he carried to the tent of the  hunter and, hovering over the tent he suddenly let the fat drop to  the earth and at once the pet crane picked it up and carried it to the  woman.    Wishing to surprise the family on their awakening in the morning she  got a good stick for a light, heaped up sticks on the dying embers, and  started up a rousing fire and proceeded to melt or try out the fat, as  melted fat is considered a favorite dish. Although busily occupied she  kept her ears open for any strange noises coming out of the forest,  there being usually some enemies lurking around. She held her pan in  such a position that after the fat started to melt and quite a lot of  the hot grease accumulated in the pan, she could plainly see the tent  door reflected in the hot grease, as though she used a mirror.    When she had nearly completed her task, she heard a noise as though some  footsteps were approaching. Instantly her heart began to beat a tattoo  on her ribs, but she sat perfectly quiet, calling all her self-control  into play to keep from making an outcry. This smart woman had already  studied out a way in which to best this enemy, in case an enemy it  should be. The footsteps, or noise, continued to advance, until at last  the woman saw reflected in the pan of grease a hand slowly protruding  through the tent door, and the finger pointed, as if counting, to the  sleeping father, then to each one of the sleeping children, then to her  who sat at the fire. Little did Mr. Enemy suppose that the brave woman  who sat so composed at her fire, was watching every motion he was  making. The hand slowly withdrew, and as the footsteps slowly died  away, there rang out on the still night air the deep fierce howl of the  prairie wolf. (This imitation of a prairie wolf is the signal to the war  party that an enemy has been discovered by the scout whom they have sent  out in advance). At once she aroused her husband and children. Annoyed  at being so unceremoniously disturbed from his deep sleep, the husband  crossly asked why she had awakened him so roughly. The wife explained  what she had seen and heard. She at once pinned an old blanket around  the crane's shoulders and an old piece of buffalo hide on his head for a  hat or head covering. Heaping piles of wood onto the fire she instructed  him to run around outside of the hut until the family returned, as they  were going to see if they could find some roots to mix up with the fat.  Hurriedly she tied her blanket around her middle, put her baby inside of  it, and then grabbed her three year old son and packed him on her back.  The father also hurriedly packed the next two and the older boy took  care of himself.    Immediately upon leaving the tent they took three different directions,  to meet again on the high hill west of their home. The reflection from  the fire in the tent disclosed to them the poor pet crane running around  the tent. It looked exactly like a child with its blanket and hat on.    Suddenly there rang out a score of shots and war whoops of the dreaded  Crow Indians. Finding the tent deserted they disgustedly filed off and  were swallowed up in the darkness of the deep forest.    The next morning the family returned to see what had become of their pet  crane. There, riddled to pieces, lay the poor bird who had given up his  life to save his dear friends.              WHITE PLUME    There once lived a young couple who were very happy. The young man was  noted throughout the whole nation for his accuracy with the bow and  arrow, and was given the title of \"Dead Shot,\" or \"He who never  misses his mark,\" and the young woman, noted for her beauty, was named  Beautiful Dove.    One day a stork paid this happy couple a visit and left them a fine big  boy. The boy cried \"Ina, ina\" (mother, mother). \"Listen to our son,\"  said the mother, \"he can speak, and hasn't he a sweet voice?\" \"Yes,\"  said the father, \"it will not be long before he will be able to walk.\"  He set to work making some arrows, and a fine hickory bow for his son.  One of the arrows he painted red, one blue, and another yellow. The rest  he left the natural color of the wood. When he had completed them, the  mother placed them in a fine quiver, all worked in porcupine quills,  and hung them up over where the boy slept in his fine hammock of painted  moose hide.    At times when the mother would be nursing her son, she would look up at  the bow and arrows and talk to her baby, saying: \"My son, hurry up and  grow fast so you can use your bow and arrows. You will grow up to be  as fine a marksman as your father.\" The baby would coo and stretch his  little arms up towards the bright colored quiver as though he understood  every word his mother had uttered. Time passed and the boy grew up to a  good size, when one day his father said: \"Wife, give our son the bow and  arrows so that he may learn how to use them.\" The father taught his son  how to string and unstring the bow, and also how to attach the arrow to  the string. The red, blue and yellow arrows, he told the boy, were to be  used only whenever there was any extra good shooting to be done, so the  boy never used these three until he became a master of the art. Then he  would practice on eagles and hawks, and never an eagle or hawk continued  his flight when the boy shot one of the arrows after him.    One day the boy came running into the tent, exclaiming: \"Mother, mother,  I have shot and killed the most beautiful bird I ever saw.\" \"Bring  it in, my son, and let me look at it.\" He brought the bird and upon  examining it she pronounced it a different type of bird from any she had  ever seen. Its feathers were of variegated colors and on its head was  a topknot of pure white feathers. The father, returning, asked the boy  with which arrow he had killed the bird. \"With the red one,\" answered  the boy. \"I was so anxious to secure the pretty bird that, although I  know I could have killed it with one of my common arrows, I wanted to  be certain, so I used the red one.\" \"That is right, my son,\" said the  father. \"When you have the least doubt of your aim, always use one of  the painted arrows, and you will never miss your mark.\"    The parents decided to give a big feast in honor of their son killing  the strange, beautiful bird. So a great many elderly women were called  to the tent of Pretty Dove to assist her in making ready for the big  feast. For ten days these women cooked and pounded beef and cherries,  and got ready the choicest dishes known to the Indians. Of buffalo,  beaver, deer, antelope, moose, bear, quail, grouse, duck of all kinds,  geese and plover meats there was an abundance. Fish of all kinds, and  every kind of wild fruit were cooked, and when all was in readiness, the  heralds went through the different villages, crying out: \"Ho-po, ho-po\"  (now all, now all), \"Dead Shot and his wife, Beautiful Dove, invite all  of you, young and old, to their tepee to partake of a great feast, given  by them in honor of a great bird which their son has killed, and also to  select for their son some good name which he will bear through life. So  all bring your cups and wooden dishes along with your horn spoons, as  there will be plenty to eat. Come, all you council men and chiefs,  as they have also a great tent erected for you in which you hold your  council.\"    Thus crying, the heralds made the circle of the village. The guests soon  arrived. In front of the tent was a pole stuck in the ground and painted  red, and at the top of the pole was fastened the bird of variegated  colors; its wings stretched out to their full length and the beautiful  white waving so beautifully from its topknot, it was the center of  attraction. Half way up the pole was tied the bow and arrow of the young  marksman. Long streamers of fine bead and porcupine work waved from  the pole and presented a very striking appearance. The bird was faced  towards the setting sun. The great chief and medicine men pronounced the  bird \"Wakan\" (something holy).    When the people had finished eating they all fell in line and marched in  single file beneath the bird, in order to get a close view of it. By the  time this vast crowd had fully viewed the wonderful bird, the sun was  just setting clear in the west, when directly over the rays of the  sun appeared a cloud in the shape of a bird of variegated colors. The  councilmen were called out to look at the cloud, and the head medicine  man said that it was a sign that the boy would grow up to be a great  chief and hunter, and would have a great many friends and followers.    This ended the feast, but before dispersing, the chief and councilmen  bestowed upon the boy the title of White Plume.    One day a stranger came to the village, who was very thin and nearly  starved. So weak was he that he could not speak, but made signs for  something to eat. Luckily the stranger came to Dead Shot's tent, and as  there was always a plentiful supply in his lodge, the stranger soon had  a good meal served him. After he had eaten and rested he told his story.    \"I came from a very great distance,\" said he. \"The nations where I came  from are in a starving condition. No place can they find any buffalo,  deer nor antelope. A witch or evil spirit in the shape of a white  buffalo has driven all the large game out of the country. Every day this  white buffalo comes circling the village, and any one caught outside of  their tent is carried away on its horns. In vain have the best marksmen  of the tribe tried to shoot it. Their arrows fly wide off the mark, and  they have given up trying to kill it as it bears a charmed life.

She did loyal, unpaid work as the editor of the \"Dial,\" which from 1840  to 1844 was the organ of Transcendentalism. She joined the community at  Brook Farm, whose story has been so well told by Lindsay Swift. For  a while she served as literary editor of the \"New York Tribune\" under  Horace Greeley. Then she went abroad, touched Rousseau's manuscripts at  Paris with trembling, adoring fingers, made a secret marriage in Italy  with the young Marquis Ossoli, and perished by shipwreck, with her  husband and child, off Fire Island in 1850.    Theodore Parker, like Alcott and \"Margaret,\" an admirable Greek scholar,  an idealist and reformer, still lives in Chadwick's biography, in  Colonel Higginson's delightful essay, and in the memories of a few  liberal Bostonians who remember his tremendous sermons on the platform  of the old Music Hall. He was a Lexington farmer's son, with the  temperament of a blacksmith, with enormous, restless energy, a good  hater, a passionate lover of all excellent things save meekness. He died  at fifty, worn out, in Italy.    But while these three figures were, after Emerson and Thoreau, the most  representative of the group, the student of the Transcendental period  will be equally interested in watching its influence upon many other  types of young men: upon future journalists and publicists like George  William Curtis, Charles A. Dana, and George Ripley; upon religionists  like Orestes Brownson, Father Hecker, and James Freeman Clarke; and  upon poets like Jones Very, Christopher. P. Cranch, and Ellery Channing.  There was a sunny side of the whole movement, as T. W. Higginson and  F. B. Sanborn, two of the latest survivors of the ferment, loved to  emphasize in their talk and in their books; and it was shadowed also by  tragedy and the pathos of unfulfilled desires. But as one looks back at  it, in the perspective of three-quarters of a century, it seems chiefly  something touchingly fine. For all these men and women tried to hitch  their wagon to a star.        CHAPTER VII. ROMANCE, POETRY, AND HISTORY    Moving in and out of the Transcendentalist circles, in that  great generation preceding the Civil War, were a company of other  men--romancers, poets, essayists, historians--who shared in the  intellectual liberalism of the age, but who were more purely artists  in prose and verse than they were seekers after the unattainable.  Hawthorne, for example, sojourned at Concord and at Brook Farm with some  of the most extreme types of transcendental extravagance. The movement  interested him artistically and he utilized it in his romances, but  personally he maintained an attitude of cool detachment from it.  Longfellow was too much of an artist to lose his head over philosophical  abstractions; Whittier, at his best, had a too genuine poetic instinct  for the concrete; and Lowell and Holmes had the saving gift of humor.  Cultivated Boston gentlemen like Prescott, Motley, and Parkman preferred  to keep their feet on the solid earth and write admirable histories. So  the mellow years went by. Most of the widely-read American books were  being produced within twenty miles of the Boston State House. The  slavery issue kept growling, far away, but it was only now and then,  as in the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, that it was  brought sharply home to the North. The \"golden forties\" were as truly  golden for New England as for idle California. There was wealth,  leisure, books, a glow of harvest-time in the air, though the spirit of  the writers is the spirit of youth.    Nathaniel Hawthorne, our greatest writer of pure romance, was Puritan by  inheritance and temperament, though not in doctrine or in sympathy. His  literary affiliations were with the English and German Romanticists,  and he possessed, for professional use, the ideas and vocabulary of his  transcendental friends. Born in Salem in 1804, he was descended from  Judge Hawthorne of Salem Witchcraft fame, and from a long line of  sea-faring ancestors. He inherited a morbid solitariness, redeemed in  some measure by a physical endowment of rare strength and beauty. He  read Spenser, Rousseau, and the \"Newgate Calendar,\" was graduated at  Bowdoin, with Longfellow, in the class of 1825, and returned to Salem  for thirteen brooding lonely years in which he tried to teach himself  the art of story-writing. His earliest tales, like Irving's, are essays  in which characters emerge; he is absorbed in finding a setting for a  preconceived \"moral\"; he is in love with allegory and parable. His own  words about his first collection of stories, \"Twice-Told Tales,\" have  often been quoted: \"They have the pale tint of flowers that blossomed  in too retired a shade.\" Yet they are for the most part exquisitely  written. After a couple of years in the Boston Custom-House, and a  residence at the socialistic community of Brook Farm, Hawthorne made the  happiest of marriages to Sophia Peabody, and for nearly four years dwelt  in the Old Manse at Concord. He described it in one of the ripest of his  essays, the Preface to \"Mosses from an Old Manse,\" his second collection  of stories. After three years in the Custom-House at Salem, his  dismissal in 1849 gave him leisure to produce his masterpiece, \"The  Scarlet Letter,\" published in 1850. He was now forty-six. In 1851, he  published \"The House of the Seven Gables,\" \"The Wonder-Book,\" and \"The  Snow Image, and Other Tales.\" In 1852 came \"The Blithedale Romance,\" a  rich ironical story drawn from his Brook Farm experience. Four years  in the American Consulate at Liverpool and three subsequent years of  residence upon the Continent saw no literary harvest except carefully  filled notebooks and the deeply imaginative moral romance, \"The Marble  Faun.\" Hawthorne returned home in 1860 and settled in the Wayside at  Concord, busying himself with a new, and, as was destined, a never  completed story about the elixir of immortality. But his vitality was  ebbing, and in May, 1864, he passed away in his sleep. He rests under  the pines in Sleepy Hollow, near the Alcotts and the Emersons.    It is difficult for contemporary Americans to assess the value of such  a man, who evidently did nothing except to write a few books. His rare,  delicate genius was scarcely touched by passing events. Not many of  his countrymen really love his writings, as they love, for instance the  writings of Dickens or Thackeray or Stevenson. Everyone reads, at some  time of his life, \"The Scarlet Letter,\" and trembles at its passionate  indictment of the sin of concealment, at its agonized admonition, \"Be  true! Be true!\" Perhaps the happiest memories of Hawthorne's readers, as  of Kipling's readers, hover about his charming stories for children;  to have missed \"The Wonder-Book\" is like having grown old without ever  catching the sweetness of the green world at dawn. But our public has  learned to enjoy a wholly different kind of style, taught by the daily  journals, a nervous, graphic, sensational, physical style fit for  describing an automobile, a department store, a steamship, a lynching  party. It is the style of our day, and judged by it Hawthorne, who wrote  with severity, conscience, and good taste, seems somewhat old-fashioned,  like Irving or Addison. He is perhaps too completely a New Englander  to be understood by men of other stock, and has never, like Poe and  Whitman, excited strong interest among European minds.    Yet no American is surer, generation after generation, of finding a fit  audience. Hawthorne's genius was meditative rather than dramatic. His  artistic material was moral rather than physical; he brooded over the  soul of man as affected by this and that condition and situation. The  child of a new analytical age, he thought out with rigid accuracy the  precise circumstances surrounding each one of his cases and modifying  it. Many of his sketches and short stories and most of his romances deal  with historical facts, moods, and atmospheres, and he knew the past of  New England as few men have ever known it. There is solid historical  and psychological stuff as the foundation of his air-castles. His  latent radicalism furnished him with a touchstone of criticism as he  interpreted the moral standards of ancient communities; no reader of  \"The Scarlet Letter\" can forget Hawthorne's implicit condemnation of the  unimaginative harshness of the Puritans. His own judgment upon the  deep matters of the human conscience was stern enough, but it was a  universalized judgment, and by no means the result of a Calvinism  which he hated. Over-fond as he was in his earlier tales of elaborate,  fanciful, decorative treatment of themes that promised to point a moral,  in his finest short stories, such as \"The Ambitious Guest,\" \"The Gentle  Boy,\" \"Young Goodman Brown,\" \"The Snow Image,\" \"The Great Stone Face,\"  \"Drowne's Wooden Image,\" \"Rappacini's Daughter,\" the moral, if there  be one, is not obtruded. He loves physical symbols for mental and moral  states, and was poet and Transcendentalist enough to retain his youthful  affection for parables; but his true field as a story-teller is the  erring, questing, aspiring, shadowed human heart.    \"The Scarlet Letter,\" for instance, is a study of a universal theme, the  problem of concealed sin, punishment, redemption. Only the setting is  provincial. The story cannot be rightly estimated, it is true, without  remembering the Puritan reverence for physical purity, the Puritan  reverence for the magistrate-minister--differing so widely from the  respect of Latin countries for the priest--the Puritan preoccupation  with the life of the soul, or, as more narrowly construed by Calvinism,  the problem of evil. The word Adultery, although suggestively enough  present in one of the finest symbolical titles ever devised by a  romancer, does not once occur in the book. The sins dealt with"]]]
