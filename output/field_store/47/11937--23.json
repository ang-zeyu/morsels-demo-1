What information sources are used for the country flags?    Flag designs used in The World Factbook are those recognized by the  protocol office of the US Department of State.    Why do your GDP (Gross Domestic Product) statistics differ from  other sources?    We have two sets of GDP dollar estimates in The World Factbook , one  derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations and the  other derived using official exchange rates (OER). Other sources  probably use one of the two. See the Notes and Definitions section  on GDP and GDP methodology for more information.    On the CIA Web site, Chiefs of State is updated weekly, but the last  update for the Factbook was an earlier date. Why the discrepancy?    Although Chiefs of State and The World Factbook both appear on the  CIA Web site, they are produced and updated by separate staffs.  Chiefs of State includes fewer countries but more leaders, and is  updated more frequently than The World Factbook, which has a much  larger database, and includes all countries.    Some percentage distributions do not add to 100. Why not?    Because of rounding, percentage distributions do not always add  precisely to 100%. Rounding of numbers always results in a loss of  precision--i.e., error. This error becomes apparent when percentage  data are totaled, as the following two examples show:                          Original Data      Rounded to whole integer    Example 1                43.2                            43                           30.4                            30                           26.4                            26                           ----                            --                          100.0                            99    Example 2                42.8                            43                           31.6                            32                           25.6                            26                           ----                            --                          100.0                           101      When this occurs, we do not force the numbers to add exactly to 100,  because doing so would introduce additional error into the  distribution.    What rounding convention does The World Factbook use?    In deciding on the number of digits to present, the Factbook staff  assesses the accuracy of the original data and the needs of US  Government officials. All of the economic data are processed by  computer--either at the source or by the Factbook staff. The economic  data presented in The Factbook, therefore, follow the rounding  convention used by virtually all numerical software applications,  namely, any digit followed by a \"5\" is rounded up to the next higher  digit, no matter whether the original digit is even or odd. Thus,  for example, when rounded to the nearest integer, 2.5 becomes 3,  rather than 2, as occurred in some pre-computer rounding systems.    Why do you list \"Independence\" dates for countries like France,  Germany, and the United Kingdom?    For most countries, this entry presents the date that sovereignty  was achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For  other countries, the date may be some other significant nationhood  event such as the traditional founding date or the date of  unification, federation, confederation, establishment, or state  succession and so may not strictly be an \"Independence\" date.  Dependent entities have the nature of their dependency status noted  in this same entry.      Technical    Does The World Factbook comply with Section 508 of the  Rehabilitation Act regarding accessibility of Web pages?    The World Factbook home page has a link entitled \"Text/Low Bandwidth  Version.\" The country data in the text version is fully accessible.  We believe The World Factbook is compliant with the Section 508 law  in both fact and spirit. If you are experiencing difficulty, please  use our comment form to provide us details of the specific problem  you are experiencing and the assistive software and/or hardware that  you are using so that we can work with our technical support staff  to find and implement a solution. We welcome visitors' suggestions  to improve accessibility of The World Factbook and the CIA Web site.    I am using the Factbook online and it is not working. What is wrong?    Hundreds of \"Factbook\" look-alikes exist on the Internet. The  Factbook site at: www.cia.gov is the only official site.    When I attempt to download a PDF (Portable Document Format) map file  (or some other map) the file has no image. Can you fix this?    Some of the files on The World Factbook Web site are large and could  take several minutes to download on a dial-up connection. The screen  might be blank during the download process.    When I open a map on The World Factbook site, it is fuzzy or  granular, or too big or too small. Why?    Adjusting the resolution setting on your monitor should correct this  problem.    Is The World Factbook country data available in machine-readable  format? All I can find is HTML, but I'm looking for simple tabular  data.    The Factbook Web site now features \"Rank Order\" pages for selected  Factbook entries. \"Rank Order\" pages are available for those data  fields identified with a small bar chart icon located next to the  title of the data entry. In addition, all of the \"Rank Order\" pages  can be downloaded as tab-delimited data files that can be opened in  other applications such as spreadsheets and databases.        =====================================================================        @Afghanistan    Introduction  Afghanistan        Background:    Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded  Afghanistan in 1747. The country served as a buffer between the  British and Russian empires until it won independence from notional  British control in 1919. A brief experiment in democracy ended in a  1973 coup and a 1978 Communist counter-coup. The Soviet Union  invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan Communist regime,  touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew in 1989  under relentless pressure by internationally supported  anti-Communist mujahedin rebels. A series of subsequent civil wars  saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline  Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the  country's civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001  terrorist attacks in New York City, a US, Allied, and anti-Taliban  Northern Alliance military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering  Osama BIN LADIN. The UN-sponsored Bonn Conference in 2001  established a process for political reconstruction that included the  adoption of a new constitution, a presidential election in 2004, and  National Assembly elections in 2005. In December 2004, Hamid KARZAI  became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan and  the National Assembly was inaugurated the following December.  Despite gains toward building a stable central government, a  resurgent Taliban and continuing provincial instability -  particularly in the south and the east - remain serious challenges  for the Afghan Government.

C.

GEORGE SAND.\"               *       *       *       *       *    The first volume of _The Stones of Venice_, by Mr. RUSKIN, has been  republished by Mr. Wiley, and we trust it will have a very large sale in  this country, which was never in greater need of instructions upon any  subject than it is now upon that of architecture. In all our cities  there is remarkable activity in building; the surplus wealth of the  American people is largely applied for the increase of the magnificence  of town and country residences--for the most part so ignorantly applied,  that the Genius of Architecture might almost be frightened from our  shores by the spectacles reared here to vex and astonish the next ages.  To bring about a reform, to lead the way for rationalism, in the noblest  of the practical arts, Mr. Ruskin has approved himself worthy by his  previous works. The _Stones of Venice_ will increase the fame won by his  \"Modern Painters.\" The _Literary Gazette_ says:         \"It is a book for which the time is ripe, and it cannot fail to       produce the most beneficial results, directly and indirectly,       on our national architecture. The low condition into which that       has fallen has been long felt. Mr. Ruskin has undertaken to       lead us back to the first principles of the art, and, in doing       so, to enable every reader who will bestow the necessary       attention to his exposition, to discover for himself the causes       of this decline, and to master the principles, by attention to       which, the significance and dignity of the art may be restored.       The subject is one of the widest interest; but it has been so       hedged about with technical difficulties as to debar from its       study all who had not more leisure, more perseverance, and more       money, than fall to the lot of the majority of even cultivated       minds. At once popular and profound, this book will be       gratefully hailed by a circle of readers even larger than Mr.       Ruskin has found for his previous works. He has so written as       to catch the ear of all kinds of persons: 'Every man,' he says       truly, 'has at some time of his life personal interest in       architecture. He has influence on the design of some public       building; or he has to buy, or build, or alter his own house.       It signifies less, whether the knowledge of other arts be       general or not; men may live without buying pictures or       statues; but in architecture all must in some way commit       themselves; they _must_ do mischief, and waste their money, if       they do not know how to turn it to account. Churches, and       shops, and warehouses, and cottages, and small row, and place,       and terrace houses, must be built and lived in, however joyless       and inconvenient. And it is assuredly intended that all of us       should have knowledge, and act upon our knowledge, in matters       in which we are daily concerned, and not be left to the caprice       of architects, or mercy of contractors.\"         \"Those who live in cities are peculiarly dependent for       enjoyment upon the beauty of its architectural features. Shut       out from mountain, river, lake, forest, cliff, and hedgerow,       they must either find in streets and squares food for pleasant       contemplation, or be drawn into indifference by meaningless,       ill-proportioned, or unsightly forms. 'We are forced,' says Mr.       Ruskin, 'for the sake of accumulating our power and knowledge,       to live in cities; but such advantage as we have in association       with each other, is in great part counterbalanced by our loss       of fellowship with nature. We cannot all have our gardens now,       nor our pleasant fields to meditate in at eventide. Then the       function of our architecture is, as far as may be, to replace       these; to tell us about nature; to possess us with memories of       her quietness; to be solemn and full of tenderness like her,       and rich in portraitures of her; full of delicate imagery of       the flowers we can no more gather, and of the living creatures       now far away from us in their own solitude. If ever you felt or       found this in a London street; if ever it furnished you with       one serious thought, or any ray of true and gentle pleasure; if       there is in your heart a true delight in its green railings,       and dark casements, and wasteful finery of shops, and feeble       coxcombry of club-houses, it is well; promote the building of       more like them. But if they never taught you any thing, and       never made you happier as you passed beneath them, do not think       they have any mysterious goodness of occult sublimity. Have       done with the wretched affectation, the futile barbarism, of       pretending to enjoy; for, as surely as you know that the meadow       grass, meshed with fairy rings, is better than the wood       pavement cut into hexagons; and as surely as you know the fresh       winds and sunshine of the upland are better than the choke-damp       of the vault, or the gaslight of the ball-room, you may know       that the good architecture which has life, and truth, and joy       in it, is better than the bad architecture, which has death,       dishonesty, and vexation of heart in it from the beginning to       the end of time.         \"To show what this good architecture is, how it is produced,       and to what end, is the object of the present volume. It is,       consequently, purely elementary, and introductory merely to the       illustration, to be furnished in the next volume from the       architectural riches of Venice, of the principles, to the       development of which it is devoted. Beginning from the       beginning, Mr. Ruskin carries his reader through the whole       details of construction with an admirable clearness of       exposition, and by a process which leaves him at the close in a       position to apply the principles which he has learned by the       way, and to form an intelligent and independent judgment upon       any form of architectural structure. The argument of the book       hangs too closely together to be indicated by extracts, or by       an analysis within the limits to which we are confined.\"    We perceive that the work of which the first volume is here noticed, is  to be followed immediately by _Examples of the Architecture of Venice_,  selected and drawn to measurement from the edifices, by Mr. Ruskin: to  be completed in twelve parts, of folio imperial size, price one guinea  each. These will not be reproduced in this country, and as the author  probably has little advantage from the American editions of his works,  we trust that for his benefit as well as for the interests of art, the  _Examples_ will be largely imported.           *       *       *       *       *    The new play written by Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, as his contribution  towards the fund raising for the new Literary Institute, is in the hands  of the literary and artistic amateurs by whom it is to be enacted, and  rehearsals are in progress. The first performance will take place  probably in June.           *       *       *       *       *    It was a custom when the world was younger than it is now, for  disappointed lovers, and outlaws, and portionless youths too proud to  labor and afraid to steal, to go into the wars; nobility, that would not  suffer them to become journeymen mechanics, led them to hire out as  journeymen butchers. But at length the field of military adventure is  almost every where closed. There is no region, ever so remote, where a  spirited and adventurous youth could hope ever to learn the art martial.  A few skirmishes on the Parana and the Plata, on the Fish River, or the  Keiskamma, form all the fighting that is going on upon the globe; and  that fighting offers no premium to the adventurer. There is no native  prince of great wealth and numerous followers, no mogul, or sultan, or  sikh, with whom the turbulent European might make a good bargain for his  courage. The last field for such enterprise was the country of the  Mahrattas, where French and English mercenaries--with a sprinkling of  Americans--created a colony which enabled the ignorant, bigoted and  jealous savages to keep in check the best European armies. A Frenchman  named Person was a pioneer in the business. He was succeeded by the  Savoyard, De Boigne, whose statue now adorns the principal square of  Chamberry. James Skinner, whose _Memoirs_ have just been published in  London by the novelist and traveler Mr. Bailie Fraser, began a similar  career under De Boigne. Some idea may be formed of the Mahratta army,  when the Peishwa at times brought 100,000 horse into the field. A  trusted officer, as Skinner afterwards became, might thus command a  division of twenty, thirty, or forty thousand men, equal in fact to the  largest European armies in the last century. When men played with such  tools as these,"]]]
