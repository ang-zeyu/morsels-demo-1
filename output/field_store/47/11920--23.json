Peel when done, and lay while hot around the possum, turning  them over and over in the abundant gravy. He should have been lightly  salted when hung up, and fully seasoned, with salt, pepper, and a trifle  of mustard, when put down to cook. Dish him in a big platter, lay the  potatoes, which should be partly browned, around him, add a little  boiling water to the pan, shake well around, and pour the gravy over  everything. Hot corn bread, strong black coffee, or else sharp cider,  and very hot sharp pickles are the things to serve with him.    _Eggs_: Eggs demand an introductory paragraph. As everybody knows, there  are eggs and eggs. An egg new-laid has a tiny air-space at each end,  betwixt the shell and the silken lining membrane. If left lying, this  confined air changes its locality--leaves the ends for the upmost side  of the shell. Shells are porous--through them the white evaporates--thus  the air bubble on top gets bigger and bigger. By the size of it you can  judge fairly the egg's age--unless it has been kept in cold storage or  in water-glass. By boiling hard, throwing in cold water and peeling  intact, you can see for yourself if a fresh egg so-called is truly  fresh. If fresh there will be no perceptible marring of its oval--but if  it shows a shrinkage, and especially if the yolk is so near the shell it  shows through the cooked white, there is proof positive that the egg is  not new-laid--though it may be perfectly wholesome.    Eggs kept in clean cool space do not deteriorate under a month. Even  after that, thus well kept, they answer for cake making, puddings and so  on. But they have an ungodly affinity for taints of almost every kind.  Hence keep them away from such things as onions, salt fish, things in  brine generally, or any strong ill odors.    Duck eggs are bigger than hen eggs--eight of them being the equivalent  to ten. Goose eggs run almost two for one. Turkey eggs, rarely used in  cookery, are still excellent eating, much better flavored than duck  eggs, which are often rather rank. Here as otherwheres, food is the  determining factor. Guinea eggs, in spite of being so much smaller, are  equal in raising power and in richness to hen eggs. Indeed, they are the  best of all eggs for eating--rich, yet delicate. The only approach to  them is the quail egg--we called it always a partridge egg--but only  special favorites of the gods have any chance of ever tasting them.  Quail nest frequently in wheat fields--at harvest, the uncovered nests  yielded choice spoil. Daddy claimed the lion's share of it for \"my white  chilluns.\" Often he came with his big hat-crown running over full of  the delicate white ovals. Mormonism must prevail in quail  circles--sometimes there were forty eggs in a nest. It would have been  vandalism of the worst to eat them, only it was no use leaving them bare  to the sun, as the birds abandoned them unless they had begun brooding.  In that case the mother sat so tight, occasionally the reaper, passing  over, took off her head. More commonly she flew away just in time,  whirring up between the mules, with a great pretense of lameness. If the  nest by good luck was discovered in time, grain was left standing about  it. Nobody grudged the yard or so of wheat lost for the sake of sport.    Partridge eggs were boiled hard, and eaten out of hand--they were much  too thin-shelled for roasting, in spite of having a very tough lining  membrane. With guinea eggs there was quite another story. They have  shells extra thick and hard--hence were laid plentifully in hot ashes,  heaped over with live coals and left as long as our patience held out.  When Mammy pulled them out, it was maddening to see her test them. She  laid a short broom straw delicately on each egg. If it whirled round,  the egg was done--if contrariwise it fell off, it had to go back in the  embers. She had no thought of letting us eat eggs not cooked till the  yolk was mealy. To this day I am firmly of opinion she was wise--and  right. Eggs roasted as she roasted them have a flavor wholly beyond and  apart from those cooked in any other way.    _Baked Eggs_: These most nearly approximate the flavor of roasted ones.  Break fresh eggs at the small ends, drain away the whites, break down  the shells to deepish cups, each with a yolk at bottom, sprinkle yolks  lightly with salt and pepper, add a bit of butter to each, then set  shells upright, close over the bottom of a pan, pop the pan into a hot  oven, bake twenty minutes, and serve piping hot. This Mammy gave us to  keep from wasting yolks when wedding or Christmas cake demanded many  whites for frosting.    _Potato Egg Puffs_: Into a quart of rich and highly seasoned mashed  potatoes, beat two eggs, then divide into equal portions--six or eight.  With lightly floured hands make each portion into a ball, set the balls  in a baking dish, then press into each a hard-boiled egg. Lay a bit of  butter on each egg, and dredge lightly with salt and pepper. Bake in a  quick oven until the potato is brown and light--it ought to rise up like  a fat apple.    _Egg Dumplings_: Cousins-germane to the puffs but richer--will serve  indeed for the meat course of a plain dinner. Mix the potato well with  half its bulk of finely chopped cold meat, the leaner the better, bind  with beaten eggs, then divide and roll each portion around a hard-boiled  egg, lay the dumplings in a greased and floured pan, giving them plenty  of room, pour around them a good gravy, or else a rich tomato sauce,  then bake ten to twenty minutes in a hot oven.    _Egg Spread_: Spread a flat pan an inch deep with rich mashed potato,  sprinkle with pepper and salt, then cover the top with eggs hard boiled,  and cut in half. Set them yolk up. Put salt, pepper and butter on each  yolk, and bake ten minutes in a warm oven. Or if soft eggs are  preferred, make depressions in the potato with the back of a spoon,  break an egg in each, dust with pepper and salt, add a dot of butter and  bake five minutes. If the potatoes are wanted brown, bake them ten  minutes after making the depressions, then put in the eggs and bake soft  or hard at will.    _Poached Eggs_: These require a deep skillet, three parts full of water  on the bubbling boil, which is slightly salted and well dashed with  vinegar. Break all the eggs separately before putting one in. Slip them  in, one after the other, quickly, taking care not to break yolks, keep  the boiling hard, and use a knife or spoon to prevent the whites from  cooking together. Take out in six to seven minutes, using a skimmer and  draining well, trim rags off white, lay in a deep hot dish, and pour  over real melted butter, made with butter, hot water, salt, pepper,  lemon juice or vinegar, and a dash of tabasco. Send to table covered--a  poached egg chilled has lost its charm. Or you may serve the eggs on  squares of hot, well-buttered toast, which have been sprinkled thickly  with grated cheese, then set for a minute inside a hot oven. Served  thus, pass the melted butter with them, as if poured over, they might be  too rich for some palates.    _Egg Fours_: Cut hard-boiled eggs in four lengthwise, mix yolks with an  equal bulk of sardines, drained, freed of skin and bone, and minced  fine. Season with salt, pepper, lemon juice, or vinegar, and olive oil.  Add minced olives if you like. The mixture must be soft, but not too  soft to shape well. Shape it into small ovals, using two spoons, and lay  an oval in each quarter of the whites. Put very narrow strips of pimento  on the ovals, then sprinkle them thickly with grated cheese--Edam is  good for such use. Set in a baking dish and cook two to four minutes in  a hot oven. If wanted extra tasty, as for a relish before dinner, set  the fours on narrow strips of toast, spread with made mustard,  well-mixed with finely minced very sour cucumber pickle.    Bacon sliced thin, fried crisp without scorching, and finely minced can  take the place of sardines. Indeed, in making fours the widest latitude  prevails--you can vary flavors and proportions almost infinitely. Onion,  even a suspicion of garlic, tabasco, Cayenne vinegar, walnut catsup, or  Worcester can be added. Capers mixed through the mass make it  wonderfully piquant. But things which need to be crisply fresh, such as  celery and lettuce, must be let severely alone.    _Stuffed Eggs_: Staple for picnics, and barbecues. Boil twenty minutes,  throw instantly in cold water, and shell immediately. Halve, mash yolks  while hot with a plentiful seasoning of butter, pepper, salt, a little  onion juice, capers or bigger pickle finely minced, and pimentos cut  small. Work the seasoning well through, then shape into balls yolk-size,  put each between two half-whites, and fasten together with a couple of  tooth picks. Wrap each as finished in wax paper, and keep cool until  needed. Here may be a good place to say that the quicker a hard-boiled  egg is got out of its shell after chilling, the better and more delicate  will be its flavor.    _Fried Eggs_: Anybody, almost, can fry an egg wrong. It takes some skill  to fry one exactly right. Have the frying pan covered with grease, hot,  but not scorching, slip in the eggs, previously broken separately,  taking pains not to break yolks, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper,  keep edges from running together, then when they have hardened  underneath, dip hot grease over the tops, keeping on till the white  sets. If the heat is right the eggs will not stick to the pan. Cook as  hard as is desirable, take up with a cake-turner, and lay in a shallow  pan, lined with soft clean paper. Keep hot while they drain--it takes a  minute or so--then remove to a blazing hot dish, and serve. If ham goes  with them lay it in the middle, with eggs all around it. Triangles of  fried toast in between look and taste well at breakfast.

The gods heard the decision with dismay, and all drew back except  Tyr, who, seeing that the others would not venture to comply with  this condition, boldly stepped forward and thrust his hand between  the monster's jaws. The gods now fastened Gleipnir securely around  Fenris's neck and paws, and when they saw that his utmost efforts to  free himself were fruitless, they shouted and laughed with glee. Tyr,  however, could not share their joy, for the wolf, finding himself  captive, bit off the god's hand at the wrist, which since then has  been known as the wolf's joint.          Loki.        \"Be silent, Tyr!      Thou couldst never settle      A strife 'twixt two;      Of thy right hand also      I must mention make,      Which Fenris from thee took.          Tyr.        I of a hand am wanting,      But thou of honest fame;      Sad is the lack of either.      Nor is the wolf at ease:      He in bonds must abide      Until the gods' destruction.\"                Saemund's Edda (Thorpe's tr.).      Deprived of his right hand, Tyr was now forced to use the maimed arm  for his shield, and to wield his sword with his left hand; but such  was his dexterity that he slew his enemies as before.    The gods, in spite of the wolf's struggles, drew the end of the fetter  Gelgia through the rock Gioll, and fastened it to the boulder Thviti,  which was sunk deep in the ground. Opening wide his fearful jaws,  Fenris uttered such terrible howls that the gods, to silence him,  thrust a sword into his mouth, the hilt resting upon his lower jaw  and the point against his palate. The blood then began to pour out  in such streams that it formed a great river, called Von. The wolf  was destined to remain thus chained fast until the last day, when he  would burst his bonds and would be free to avenge his wrongs.          \"The wolf Fenrir,      Freed from the chain,      Shall range the earth.\"                Death-song of Hakon (W. Taylor's tr.).      While some mythologists see in this myth an emblem of crime restrained  and made innocuous by the power of the law, others see the underground  fire, which kept within bounds can injure no one, but which unfettered  fills the world with destruction and woe. Just as Odin's second  eye is said to rest in Mimir's well, so Tyr's second hand (sword)  is found in Fenris's jaws. He has no more use for two weapons than  the sky for two suns.    The worship of Tyr is commemorated in sundry places (such as Tuebingen,  in Germany), which bear more or less modified forms of his name. The  name has also been given to the aconite, a plant known in Northern  countries as \"Tyr's helm.\"              CHAPTER VI: BRAGI      The Origin of Poetry    At the time of the dispute between the AEsir and Vanas, when peace  had been agreed upon, a vase was brought into the assembly into which  both parties solemnly spat. From this saliva the gods created Kvasir,  a being renowned for his wisdom and goodness, who went about the  world answering all questions asked him, thus teaching and benefiting  mankind. The dwarfs, hearing about Kvasir's great wisdom, coveted it,  and finding him asleep one day, two of their number, Fialar and Galar,  treacherously slew him, and drained every drop of his blood into  three vessels--the kettle Od-hroerir (inspiration) and the bowls Son  (expiation) and Boden (offering). After duly mixing this blood with  honey, they manufactured from it a sort of beverage so inspiring that  any one who tasted it immediately became a poet, and could sing with  a charm which was certain to win all hearts.    Now, although the dwarfs had brewed this marvellous mead for their own  consumption, they did not even taste it, but hid it away in a secret  place, while they went in search of further adventures. They had not  gone very far ere they found the giant Gilling also sound asleep,  lying on a steep bank, and they maliciously rolled him into the water,  where he perished. Then hastening to his dwelling, some climbed on  the roof, carrying a huge millstone, while the others, entering,  told the giantess that her husband was dead. This news caused the  poor creature great grief, and she rushed out of the house to view  Gilling's remains. As she passed through the door, the wicked dwarfs  rolled the millstone down upon her head, and killed her. According to  another account, the dwarfs invited the giant to go fishing with them,  and succeeded in slaying him by sending him out in a leaky vessel,  which sank beneath his weight.    The double crime thus committed did not long remain unpunished, for  Gilling's brother, Suttung, quickly went in search of the dwarfs,  determined to avenge him. Seizing them in his mighty grasp, the giant  conveyed them to a shoal far out at sea, where they would surely have  perished at the next high tide had they not succeeded in redeeming  their lives by promising to deliver to the giant their recently  brewed mead. As soon as Suttung set them ashore, they therefore  gave him the precious compound, which he entrusted to his daughter  Gunlod, bidding her guard it night and day, and allow neither gods  nor mortals to have so much as a taste. The better to fulfil this  command, Gunlod carried the three vessels into the hollow mountain,  where she kept watch over them with the most scrupulous care, nor  did she suspect that Odin had discovered their place of concealment,  thanks to the sharp eyes of his ever-vigilant ravens Hugin and Munin.        The Quest of the Draught    As Odin had mastered the runic lore and had tasted the waters of  Mimir's fountain, he was already the wisest of gods; but learning  of the power of the draught of inspiration manufactured out of  Kvasir's blood, he became very anxious to obtain possession of the  magic fluid. With this purpose in view he therefore donned his  broad-brimmed hat, wrapped himself in his cloud-hued cloak, and  journeyed off to Joetun-heim. On his way to the giant's dwelling he  passed by a field where nine ugly thralls were busy making hay. Odin  paused for a moment, watching them at their work, and noticing that  their scythes seemed very dull indeed, he proposed to whet them,  an offer which the thralls eagerly accepted.    Drawing a whetstone from his bosom, Odin proceeded to sharpen the  nine scythes, skilfully giving them such a keen edge that the thralls,  delighted, begged that they might have the stone. With good-humoured  acquiescence, Odin tossed the whetstone over the wall; but as the  nine thralls simultaneously sprang forward to catch it, they wounded  one another with their keen scythes. In anger at their respective  carelessness, they now began to fight, and did not pause until they  were all either mortally wounded or dead.    Quite undismayed by this tragedy, Odin continued on his way, and  shortly after came to the house of the giant Baugi, a brother  of Suttung, who received him very hospitably. In the course of  conversation, Baugi informed him that he was greatly embarrassed,  as it was harvest time and all his workmen had just been found dead  in the hayfield.    Odin, who on this occasion had given his name as Bolwerk (evil doer),  promptly offered his services to the giant, promising to accomplish  as much work as the nine thralls, and to labour diligently all the  summer in exchange for one single draught of Suttung's magic mead when  the busy season was ended. This bargain was immediately concluded,  and Baugi's new servant, Bolwerk, worked incessantly all the summer  long, more than fulfilling his contract, and safely garnering all the  grain before the autumn rains began to fall. When the first days of  winter came, Bolwerk presented himself before his master, claiming  his reward. But Baugi hesitated and demurred, saying he dared not  openly ask his brother Suttung for the draught of inspiration, but  would try to obtain it by guile. Together, Bolwerk and Baugi then  proceeded to the mountain where Gunlod dwelt, and as they could find  no other mode of entering the secret cave, Odin produced his trusty  auger, called Rati, and bade the giant bore with all his might to  make a hole through which he might crawl into the interior.    Baugi silently obeyed, and after a few moments' work withdrew the tool,  saying that he had pierced through the mountain, and that Odin would  have no difficulty in slipping through. But the god, mistrusting this  statement, merely blew into the hole, and when the dust and chips came  flying into his face, he sternly bade Baugi resume his boring and not  attempt to deceive him again. The giant did as he was told, and when  he withdrew his tool again, Odin ascertained that the hole was really  finished. Changing himself into a snake, he wriggled through with  such remarkable rapidity that he managed to elude the sharp auger,  which Baugi treacherously thrust into the hole after him, intending  to kill him.          \"Rati's mouth I caused      To make a space,      And to gnaw the rock;      Over and under me      Were the Joetun's ways:      Thus I my head did peril.\"                Havamal (Thorpe's tr.).        The Rape of the Draught    Having reached the interior of the mountain, Odin reassumed his usual  godlike form and starry mantle, and then presented himself in the  stalactite-hung cave before the beautiful Gunlod. He intended to win  her love as a means of inducing her to grant him a sip from each of  the vessels confided to her care.    Won by his passionate wooing, Gunlod consented to become his wife,  and after he had spent three whole days with her in this retreat,  she brought out the vessels from their secret hiding-place, and told  him he might take a sip from each.          \"And a draught obtained      Of the precious mead,      Drawn from Od-hroerir.\"       "]]]
