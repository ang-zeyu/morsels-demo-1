These they laid down as presents, and then, without speaking a word,  drew back.  The Adelantado distributed among them various trinkets,  which so pleased them that they came with still more abundant supplies.  These natives had higher foreheads than those of the islands.  Some were  entirely naked and had their bodies tatooed, some wore coverings about  the loins, and others short cotton jerkins without sleeves.  The  chieftains had coats of white or coloured cotton.  The Indian guide  asserted that some of them were cannibals.    Day after day, exposed to storms, drenching rains, and currents,  Columbus made his way along the coast of Honduras, often gaining only a  league or two in the day.  Though suffering from gout, he still attended  to his duty, having had a small cabin fitted on deck from which he could  keep a look-out.  Often he was so ill that he thought his end was  approaching.    At length, after two months of continued gales, fine weather returned,  and he doubled the Cape, to which he gave the name of Gracias a Dios, or  Thanks to God.  He next sailed along what is now called the Mosquito  shore, seeing many rivers in which grew enormous reeds, abounding with  fish, alligators, and turtles.    While the squadron was anchored near a river and the boats were on shore  to obtain wood and water, a bore, or swell of the sea, occurred, by  which one of them was swallowed up, and all on board perished.  The  name, therefore, of El Rio del Desastro was given to the river.    The next place at which the ships dropped anchor was between a beautiful  island, which Columbus called La Huerta, or The Garden, and the  mainland, where some way up was a native village named Cariari.  The  inhabitants, seeing the ships, quickly gathered on the shore, prepared  to defend their country; but when the Spaniards made no attempt to land,  their hostility ceased, and, waving their mantles, they invited the  strangers on shore.  Swimming off, they brought mantles of cotton and  ornaments of guanin.    The Admiral, though he made them presents, would take nothing in  exchange, and the savages, supposing that their proffered gifts were  despised, retaliated, pretending indifference to the things offered  them, and, on returning on shore, tied all the European articles up and  left them on the beach.    The following day, while a boat cautiously approached the shore to  procure water, a venerable-looking Indian appeared, bearing a white  banner on the end of a staff, and leading a girl of fourteen, and  another of about eight years of age.  These he made signs were to be  detained as hostages while the Spaniards were on shore.  They were taken  on board, and being kept under the care of the Admiral, were clothed and  adorned with various ornaments, and on the following morning were  restored to their friends, who appeared grateful for the kind way in  which they had been treated, but returned all the presents they had  received.    On the Adelantado approaching the beach, two of the principal natives,  wading into the water, carried him ashore in their arms.  Wishing to  collect information, he ordered the notary of the squadron to write down  their replies; but no sooner did they see the pen, ink, and paper than,  supposing he was working some necromantic spell, they fled in terror.  After some time they returned, scattering a fragrant powder in the air,  intended, apparently, to counteract it.  The Spaniards, equally  ignorant, also fancied that the Indians were performing some magic rite;  indeed, Columbus asserts that they believed all the hardships and foul  winds they had experienced on the coast were owing to the witchcraft of  the natives.    On leaving this place, Columbus carried off two of the natives, to serve  as guides, promising that he would restore them, with ample  remuneration, on his return.    The squadron then sailed along the coast now known as Costa Rica, and  anchored in a large bay, full of islands, called Caribaro, the  neighbourhood of which, the natives of Cariari had asserted, abounded  with gold.  The islands were covered with groves, which sent forth the  fragrance of fruits and flowers; and so deep and narrow were the  channels, that the spars of the vessels, as they passed on, brushed the  overhanging branches.  The natives were at first afraid, but, encouraged  by the guides, advanced with confidence.  They wore numerous ornaments  of pure gold, and one of them exchanged a plate of gold, valued at ten  ducats, for three hawks' bells.    The country on the mainland was hilly, the villages perched on the  heights.  As the boats proceeded to the bottom of the bay, they met ten  canoes, the Indians in which had their heads decorated with garlands of  flowers, and coronets formed of the claws of beasts and the quills of  birds, while most of them wore plates of gold about their necks.  Although they refused to part with the gold, they told the Spaniards it  was to be had in abundance within the distance of two days' journey,  mentioning, among other places, Veragua.    Columbus, eager to discover the strait, cared, at this time, very little  for the gold, and sailing along the coast, now known as that of Veragua,  came off the mouth of a large river.  Here the natives rushed into the  water, brandishing their weapons; but were quickly pacified, and  bartered away seventeen plates of gold, worth one hundred and fifty  ducats, for a few toys.    When the Spaniards next day went on shore, the natives exhibited a  hostile disposition, but a bolt from a crossbow wounding one of them,  and a cannon being fired, they fled with terror; and on being pursued,  threw down their weapons, and, gentle as lambs, brought three plates of  gold, meekly receiving the articles given in exchange.  A similar scene  was enacted at the next place, and nineteen plates of pure gold were  obtained.  Here, for the first time, Columbus met with signs of solid  architecture, which he believed indicated his approach to civilised  lands.  As he ran along the coast, but was unable to land on account of  the heavy sea, the guides pointed out numerous towns where gold  abounded, one of them being Veragua, where they said the plates of gold  were fabricated, and near which were the rich mines.    Soon after this he arrived opposite a village, where he was told the  country of gold terminated, but still believing that he should discover  a strait, he pushed on.  He understood from the Indians that there was a  magnificent country called Ciguare, situated at about ten days' journey  to the west, where the people wore crowns and bracelets and necklets of  gold, and used it for all domestic purposes; that they were armed like  the Spaniards, with swords, bucklers, and cuirasses.  He also fancied  they said that the sea continued round to Ciguare, and that ten days  beyond it was the Ganges.  Probably they were describing Mexico or Peru.    The country was everywhere beautiful and fertile in the extreme.  On the  2nd of November the squadron anchored in a commodious harbour, to which  Columbus gave the name of Puerto Bello, which it still retains.  They  were delayed here ten days by heavy rains and stormy weather, but the  painted natives brought off provisions, though few had ornaments of  gold.    Again sailing eastward, they passed the point now known as Nombre de  Dios, but being driven back, anchored in a harbour, which, from the  large fields of Indian corn, fruits, and vegetables, was called the Port  of Provision.  They here remained until the 23rd, endeavouring to repair  their vessels, which were fearfully pierced by the teredo.  Misled by  the seamen, always eager to get on shore, who went to sound it, he  entered a small harbour, which he called The Cabinet.  It was infested  with alligators, which filled the air with a musky odour.    The natives gathered in large numbers, and at first treated their  visitors with hospitality; but the rough seamen soon committed excesses  which aroused their hosts to vengeance.  In a short time the natives  were seen approaching to attack the vessels.  Not until some shotted  guns were fired among them did they take to flight.    The seamen now began to murmur at the continuance of the tempestuous  weather, declaring that the looked-for straits would never be found.  Columbus might have begun to suspect the same, and, to the great joy of  his men, he expressed his intention of relinquishing his search for the  present.  Sailing on the 5th of December from the Cabinet, he steered in  search of the gold-mines of Veragua.        CHAPTER EIGHT.    LAST VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS, CONCLUDED--A.D. 1503-6.

The Persian soldiers, amazed at the courage of the Greeks,  were filled with superstitious fears, and began to refuse to advance,  except when driven onward under the stinging blows of the lash.    The king was furious to see their close ranks give way time after time,  and finally ordered his own Immortals to march on and scatter the army,  which, although so small, was keeping millions of men at bay. He  expected that everything would of course give way at the very first  charge of these troops.    Imagine his wrath, therefore, when he saw the Immortals also retreat,  after many useless efforts to drive away the enemy. The Persians did not  know what to do. They could not advance, and were ashamed to retreat.          LI. DEATH OF LEONIDAS.      While the Persians were hesitating thus, a Greek shepherd, Eph-i-al'tes,  stole into their camp, and, vile traitor that he was, offered to show  them another way to get into Greece, if they would pay him well. This  man was led into the tent of a Persian general, where he explained that  he could easily lead a troop of Persians over the mountains.    By a goat path known to the Greeks only, it was possible not only to  cross the mountains, but also to come down upon the small Greek force  guarding the Pass of Thermopylae.    His offer as guide was accepted. Ephialtes, true to his promise, if not  to his country, led the Persian Immortals along this narrow way.  Leonidas, who could not imagine that any one of the Greeks would be base  enough to sell his country and honor for gold, had placed only a few of  the allies at this spot.    [Illustration: A Fighting Persian.]    The Immortals followed Ephialtes, easily cut these few men down, and  came unperceived behind the Spartan troops. It was only when he heard  the tramp of horses behind him and on the mountain above him, that  Leonidas found out that he had been betrayed.    Hastily calling his allies, he gave them permission to save themselves  by flight, declaring, however, that he and his companions would never  leave their post, and that, since they could not conquer, they were  ready to die.    Some of the allies took advantage of this permission to escape, but  seven hundred Thes'pi-ans nobly chose to remain with the Spartans. With  the courage of despair, these men now fought against the Persians before  and behind them, selling their lives as dearly as possible. In spite of  the odds against them, they refused to surrender, and finally fell, one  after another, on the spot which they had undertaken to guard.    Their bodies, which were found almost in a heap,--for they had scorned  to fly,--were honorably buried in a single mound, over which rose a  monument with this modest inscription,--        \"Go, passer-by, at Sparta tell,    Obedient to her law we fell.\"      The Persians had forced their way into Greece. Nothing could check their  further advance, so the mighty army swept southward. The first place of  note on their way to Athens was Delphi, the site of the sacred temple,  where great treasures were stored.    The Greeks knew that the Persians did not worship the same gods, and  feared that they might rob the temple: so they now eagerly questioned  the oracle, to find out whether they should not all assemble there in  its defense.    To their surprise, the oracle proudly replied, \"The gods will take care  of their own,\" and bade them rather use their strength to defend their  own homes.    The Persians marched into the rocky gorge leading to the temple at  Delphi, but just as they were entering the valley a terrible  thunderstorm broke forth. The darkness became so great that the  soldiers lost their way. The rocks rolled and crashed down upon them;  and the soldiers, filled with dread, beat a hasty retreat, and never  again dared venture into this valley.    In the mean while the Greek fleet at Artemisium had held the Persian  vessels at bay, until news was brought of the death of Leonidas, and the  passage of Thermopylae. Then the Greeks sailed as fast as they could  toward Athens, knowing that they would be needed there to defend the  city.    The various allies, sure that it would be quite useless to try to defend  the northern part of Greece any longer, retreated into the Peloponnesus,  and, hoping to prevent the Persians from entering there, hastily began  to build a huge wall all across the Isthmus of Corinth, which is only  about five miles wide.          LII. THE BURNING OF ATHENS.      As all their allies were trying only to defend the Peloponnesus, the  Athenians were left entirely alone. Many of their friends advised them  to abandon their city, and follow the other Greeks southward, leaving  all Attica a prey to the foe.    This the Athenians did not wish to do, so they sent in haste to Delphi,  to inquire of the oracle whether they had better retreat, or attempt to  defend their city. As was generally the case, the oracle did not give a  plain answer, but merely said, \"The wooden walls will defend you and  your children.\"    When this answer was brought to Athens, no one could tell exactly what  it meant. Some of the citizens fancied that the oracle was advising them  to retreat behind the ancient wooden stockade on the Acropolis, but  Themistocles insisted that by \"wooden walls\" the oracle meant their  ships.    He finally persuaded the Athenians to believe him. All the old men,  women, and children were hastily brought on board the ships, and carried  to the Peloponnesus, where they were welcomed by their friends. Then the  men embarked in their turn, and the fleet sailed off to the Bay of  Sal'a-mis, where it awaited a good chance to fight.    The Persians swept down into Attica, and entered the deserted city of  Athens. Here they gazed in wonder at all they saw, and, after robbing  the houses, set fire to the town, and burned down all the most beautiful  buildings.    The Persians were so delighted at having attained their purpose, and  reduced the proud city to ashes, that they sent messengers to bear the  glad tidings to the Persian capital. Here the people became almost wild  with joy, and the whole city rang with their cries of triumph for many a  day.    As you will remember, Themistocles had allowed the Spartans to command  both the army and the navy. It was therefore a Spartan king,  Eu-ry-bi'a-des, who was head of the fleet at Salamis. He was a careful  man, and was not at all in favor of attacking the Persians.    Themistocles, on the contrary, felt sure that an immediate attack, being  unexpected, would prove successful, and therefore loudly insisted upon  it. His persistency in urging it finally made Eurybiades so angry that  he exclaimed, \"Those who begin the race before the signal is given are  publicly scourged!\"    Themistocles, however, would not allow even this remark to annoy him,  and calmly answered, \"Very true, but laggards never win a crown!\" The  reply, which Eurybiades thought was meant for an insult, so enraged him  that he raised his staff to strike the bold speaker. At this, the brave  Athenian neither drew back nor flew into a passion: he only cried,  \"Strike if you will, but hear me!\"    Once more Themistocles explained his reasons for urging an immediate  attack; and his plans were so good, that Eurybiades, who could but  admire his courage, finally yielded, and gave orders to prepare for  battle.          LIII. THE BATTLES OF SALAMIS AND PLATAEA.      The fleets soon came face to face; and Xerxes took up his post on a  mountain, where he sat in state upon a hastily built throne to see his  vessels destroy the enemy. He had made very clever plans, and, as his  fleet was far larger than that of the Greeks, he had no doubt that he  would succeed in defeating them.    His plans, however, had been found out by Aristides, who was in the  Island of AEgina; and this noble man rowed over to the fleet, at the risk  of being caught by the enemy, to warn his fellow-citizens of their  danger.    He first spoke to Themistocles, saying, \"Rivals we have always been; let  us now set all other rivalry aside, and only strive which can best serve  his native country.\"    Themistocles agreed to this proposal, and managed affairs so wisely and  bravely that the Greeks won a great victory. When they came home in  triumph with much spoil, the women received them with cries of joy, and  strewed flowers under their feet.    From his high position, Xerxes saw his fleet cut to pieces; and he was  so discouraged by this check, that he hastened back to Persia, leaving  his brother-in-law Mar-do'ni-us with an army of three hundred thousand  men to finish the conquest of Greece.    The Greeks were so happy over their naval victory at Salamis, that they  all flew to arms once more; and Pau-sa'ni-as, the Spartan king, the  successor of Leonidas, was soon able to lead a large army against  Mardonius.    The two forces met at Pla-tae'a, and again the Greeks won, although  fighting against foes who greatly outnumbered them. Strange to relate,  while Pausanias was winning one battle at Plataea, the other Spartan  king, Eurybiades, defeated a new Persian fleet at Myc'a-le.    These two victories finished the rout of the greatest army ever seen.  Mardonius fled with the remnant of his host, leaving his tents, baggage,  and slaves to the Greeks, who thus got much booty.    We are told that the Spartans, entering the Persian camp, were greatly  amazed at the luxury of the tents. Pausanias stopped in the one that had  been occupied by Mardonius, and bade the slaves prepare a meal such as  they had been wont to lay before their master.    [Illustration: Return of the Victorious Greeks.]    Then, calling his own Helots, he gave orders for his usual supper. When  both meals were ready, they made the greatest contrast. The Persian tent  was all decked with costly hangings, the table was spread with many  kinds of rich food served in dishes of solid gold, "]]]
