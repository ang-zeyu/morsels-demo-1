But having formed the opinion, on grounds sufficiently assured, that the  strangers who visited Egypt and superintended the building of the Great  Pyramid were kinsmen of the patriarch Abraham, it is not very difficult  to decide what was the subject respecting which they had such exact  information. They or their parents had come from the land of the  Chaldaeans, and they were doubtless learned in all the wisdom of their  Chaldaean kinsmen. They were masters, in fact, of the astronomy of their  day, a science for which the Chaldaeans had shown from the earliest ages  the most remarkable aptitude. What the actual extent of their  astronomical knowledge may have been it would be difficult to say. But  it is certain, from the exact knowledge which later Chaldaeans possessed  respecting long astronomical cycles, that astronomical observations must  have been carried on continuously by that people for many hundreds of  years. It is highly probable that the astronomical knowledge of the  Chaldaeans in the days of Terah and Abraham was much more accurate than  that possessed by the Greeks even after the time of Hipparchus.[24] We  see indeed, in the accurate astronomical adjustment of the Great  Pyramid, that the architects must have been skilful astronomers and  mathematicians; and I may note here, in passing, how strongly this  circumstance confirms the opinion that the visitors were kinsmen of  Terah and Abraham. All we know from Herodotus and Manetho, all the  evidence from the circumstances connected with the religion of the  pyramid-kings, and the astronomical evidence given by the pyramids  themselves, tends to assure us that members of that particular branch of  the Chaldaean family which went out from Ur of the Chaldees because they  would not worship the gods of the Chaldaeans, extended their wanderings  to Egypt, and eventually superintended the erection of the Great Pyramid  so far as astronomical and mathematical relations were concerned.    But not only have we already decided that the pyramids were not intended  solely or chiefly to sub serve the purpose of astronomical  observatories, but it is certain that Cheops would not have been  personally much interested in any astronomical information which these  visitors might be able to communicate. Unless he saw clearly that  something was to be gained from the lore of his visitors, he would not  have undertaken to erect any astronomical buildings at their suggestion,  even if he had cared enough for their knowledge to pay any attention to  them whatever. Most probably the reply Cheops would have made to any  communications respecting mere astronomy, would have run much in the  style of the reply made by the Turkish Cadi, Imaum Ali Zade to a friend  of Layard's who had apparently bored him about double stars and comets:  'Oh my soul! oh my lamb!' said Ali Zade, 'seek not after the things  which concern thee not. Thou camest unto us, and we welcomed thee: go in  peace. Of a truth thou hast spoken many words; and there is no harm  done, for the speaker is one and the listener is another. After the  fashion of thy people thou hast wandered from one place to another until  thou art happy and content in none. Listen, oh my son! There is no  wisdom equal unto the belief in God! He created the world, and shall we  liken ourselves unto Him in seeking to penetrate into the mysteries of  His creation? Shall we say, Behold this star spinneth round that star,  and this other star with a tail goeth and cometh in so many years! Let  it go! He from whose hand it came will guide and direct it. But thou  wilt say unto me, Stand aside, oh man, for I am more learned than thou  art, and have seen more things. If thou thinkest that thou art in this  respect better than I am, thou art welcome. I praise God that I seek not  that which I require not. Thou art learned in the things I care not for;  and as for that which thou hast seen, I defile it. Will much knowledge  create thee a double belly, or wilt thou seek paradise with thine eyes?'  Such, omitting the references to the Creator, would probably have been  the reply of Cheops to his visitors, had they only had astronomical  facts to present him with. Or, in the plenitude of his kingly power, he  might have more decisively rejected their teaching by removing their  heads.    But the shepherd-astronomers had knowledge more attractive to offer than  a mere series of astronomical discoveries. Their ancestors had      Watched from the centres of their sleeping flocks    Those radiant Mercuries, that seemed to move    Carrying through aether in perpetual round    Decrees and resolutions of the gods;    and though the visitors of King Cheops had themselves rejected the  Sabaistic polytheism of their kinsmen, they had not rejected the  doctrine that the stars in their courses affect the fortunes of men. We  know that among the Jews, probably the direct descendants of the  shepherd-chiefs who visited Cheops, and certainly close kinsmen of  theirs, and akin to them also in their monotheism, the belief in  astrology was never regarded as a superstition. In fact, we can trace  very clearly in the books relating to this people that they believed  confidently in the influences of the heavenly bodies. Doubtless the  visitors of King Cheops shared the belief of their Chaldaean kinsmen that  astrology is a true science, 'founded' indeed (as Bacon expresses their  views) 'not in reason and physical contemplations, but in the direct  experience and observation of past ages.' Josephus records the Jewish  tradition (though not as a tradition but as a fact) that 'our first  father, Adam, was instructed in astrology by divine inspiration,' and  that Seth so excelled in the science, that, 'foreseeing the Flood and  the destruction of the world thereby, he engraved the fundamental  principles of his art (astrology) in hieroglyphical emblems, for the  benefit of after ages, on two pillars of brick and stone.' He says  farther on that the Patriarch Abraham, 'having learned the art in  Chaldaea, when he journeyed into Egypt taught the Egyptians the sciences  of arithmetic and astrology.' Indeed, the stranger called Philitis by  Herodotus may, for aught that appears, have been Abraham himself; for it  is generally agreed that the word Philitis indicated the race and  country of the visitors, regarded by the Egyptians as of Philistine  descent and arriving from Palestine. However, I am in no way concerned  to show that the shepherd-astronomers who induced Cheops to build the  Great Pyramid were even contemporaries of Abraham and Melchizedek. What  seems sufficiently obvious is all that I care to maintain, namely, that  these shepherd-astronomers were of Chaldaean birth and training, and  therefore astrologers, though, unlike their Chaldaean kinsmen, they  rejected Sabaism or star-worship, and taught the belief in one only  Deity.    Now, if these visitors were astrologers, who persuaded Cheops, and were  honestly convinced themselves, that they could predict the events of any  man's life by the Chaldaean method of casting nativities, we can readily  understand many circumstances connected with the pyramids which have  hitherto seemed inexplicable. The pyramid built by a king would no  longer be regarded as having reference to his death and burial, but to  his birth and life, though after his death it might receive his body.  Each king would require to have his own nativity-pyramid, built with due  symbolical reference to the special celestial influences affecting his  fortunes. Every portion of the work would have to be carried out under  special conditions, determined according to the mysterious influences  ascribed to the different planets and their varying positions--            now high, now low, then hid.    Progressive, retrograde, or standing still.    If the work had been intended only to afford the means of predicting the  king's future, the labour would have been regarded by the monarch as  well bestowed. But astrology involved much more than the mere prediction  of future events. Astrologers claimed the power of ruling the  planets--that is, of course, not of ruling the motions of those bodies,  but of providing against evil influences or strengthening good  influences which they supposed the celestial orbs to exert in particular  aspects. Thus we can understand that while the mere basement layers of  the pyramid would have served for the process of casting the royal  nativity, with due mystic observances, the further progress of building  the pyramid would supply the necessary means and indications for ruling  the planets most potent in their influence upon the royal career.    Remembering the mysterious influence which astrologers ascribed to  special numbers, figures, positions, and so forth, the care with which  the Great Pyramid was so proportioned as to indicate particular  astronomical and mathematical relations is at once explained. The four  sides of the square base were carefully placed with reference to the  cardinal points, precisely like the four sides of the ordinary square  scheme of nativity.[25] The eastern side faced the Ascendant, the  southern faced the Mid-heaven, the western faced the Descendant, and the  northern faced the Imum Coeli. Again, we can understand that the  architects would have made a circuit of the base correspond in length  with the number of days in the year--a relation which, according to  Prof. P. Smyth, is fulfilled in this manner, that the four sides contain  one hundred times as many pyramid inches as there are days in the year.  The pyramid inch, again, is itself mystically connected with  astronomical relations, for its length is equal to the five hundred  millionth part of the earth's diameter, to a degree of exactness  corresponding well with what we might expect Chaldaean astronomers to  attain. Prof. Smyth, indeed, believes that it was exactly equal to that  proportion of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26598"],[0,"Seasoning of Wood (#18)"],[1,"or tissue and a perfect union. On the upper side  the fibres bend aside, are not continuous into the limb, and hence the  connection is not perfect (see Fig. 18). Owing to this arrangement of  the fibres, the cleft made in splitting never runs into the knot if  started on the side above the limb, but is apt to enter the knot if  started below, a fact well understood in woodcraft. When limbs die,  decay, and break off, the remaining stubs are surrounded, and may  finally be covered by the growth of the trunk and thus give rise to  the annoying \"dead\" or \"loose\" knots.        [Illustration: Fig. 18. Section of Wood showing Position of      the Grain at Base of a Limb. P, pith of both stem and limb;      1-7, seven yearly layers of wood; _a_, _b_, knot or basal      part of a limb which lived for four years, then died and      broke off near the stem, leaving the part to the left of _a_,      _b_, a \"sound\" knot, the part to the right a \"dead\" knot,      which would soon be entirely covered by the growing stem.]                              COLOR AND ODOR OF WOOD    Color, like structure, lends beauty to the wood, aids in its  identification, and is of great value in the determination of its  quality. If we consider only the heartwood, the black color of the  persimmon, the dark brown of the walnut, the light brown of the white  oaks, the reddish brown of the red oaks, the yellowish white of the  tulip and poplars, the brownish red of the redwood and cedars, the  yellow of the papaw and sumac, are all reliable marks of distinction  and color. Together with luster and weight, they are only too often  the only features depended upon in practice. Newly formed wood, like  that of the outer few rings, has but little color. The sapwood  generally is light, and the wood of trees which form no heartwood  changes but little, except when stained by forerunners of disease.    The different tints of colors, whether the brown of oak, the orange  brown of pine, the blackish tint of walnut, or the reddish cast of  cedar, are due to pigments, while the deeper shade of the summer-wood  bands in pine, cedar, oak, or walnut is due to the fact that the wood  being denser, more of the colored wood substance occurs on a given  space, _i.e._, there is more colored matter per square inch. Wood is  translucent, a thin disk of pine permitting light to pass through  quite freely. This translucency affects the luster and brightness of  lumber.    When lumber is attacked by fungi, it becomes more opaque, loses its  brightness, and in practice is designated \"dead,\" in distinction to  \"live\" or bright timber. Exposure to air darkens all wood; direct  sunlight and occasional moistening hasten this change, and cause it to  penetrate deeper. Prolonged immersion has the same effect, pine wood  becoming a dark gray, while oak changes to a blackish brown.    Odor, like color, depends on chemical compounds, forming no part of  the wood substance itself. Exposure to weather reduces and often  changes the odor, but a piece of long-leaf pine, cedar, or camphor  wood exhales apparently as much odor as ever when a new surface is  exposed. Heartwood is more odoriferous than sapwood. Many kinds of  wood are distinguished by strong and peculiar odors. This is  especially the case with camphor, cedar, pine, oak, and mahogany, and  the list would comprise every kind of wood in use were our sense of  smell developed in keeping with its importance.    Decomposition is usually accompanied by pronounced odors. Decaying  poplar emits a disagreeable odor, while red oak often becomes  fragrant, its smell resembling that of heliotrope.                                  WEIGHT OF WOOD    A small cross-section of wood (as in Fig. 19) dropped into water  sinks, showing that the substance of which wood fibre or wood is built  up is heavier than water. By immersing the wood successively in  heavier liquids, until we find a liquid in which it does not sink, and  comparing the weight of the same with water, we find that wood  substance is about 1.6 times as heavy as water, and that this is as  true of poplar as of oak or pine.        [Illustration: Fig. 19. Cross-section of a Group of Wood      Fibres (Highly Magnified.)]    Separating a single cell (as shown in Fig. 20, _a_), drying and then  dropping it into water, it floats. The air-filled cell cavity or  interior reduces its weight, and, like an empty corked bottle, it  weighs less than the water. Soon, however, water soaks into the cell,  when it fills up and sinks. Many such cells grown together, as in a  block of wood, when all or most of them are filled with water, will  float as long as the majority of them are empty or only partially  filled. This is why a green, sappy pine pole soon sinks in \"driving\"  (floating down stream). Its cells are largely filled before it is  thrown in, and but little additional water suffices to make its weight  greater than that of the water. In a good-sized white pine log,  composed chiefly of empty cells (heartwood), the water requires a very  long time to fill up the cells (five years would not suffice to fill  them all), and therefore the log may float for many months. When the  wall of the wood fibre is very thick (five eighths or more of the  volume, as in Fig. 20, _b_), the fibre sinks whether empty or filled.  This applies to most of the fibres of the dark summer-wood bands in  pines, and to the compact fibres of oak or hickory, and many,  especially tropical woods, have such thick-walled cells and so little  empty or air space that they never float.        [Illustration: Fig. 20. Isolated Fibres of Wood.]    Here, then, are the two main factors of weight in wood; the amount of  cell wall or wood substance constant for any given piece, and the  amount of water contained in the wood, variable even in the standing  tree, and only in part eliminated in drying.    The weight of the green wood of any species varies chiefly as a second  factor, and is entirely misleading, if the relative weight of  different kinds is sought. Thus some green sticks of the otherwise  lighter cypress and gum sink more readily than fresh oak.    The weight of sapwood or the sappy, peripheral part of our common  lumber woods is always great, whether cut in winter or summer. It  rarely falls much below forty-five pounds, and commonly exceeds  fifty-five pounds to the cubic foot, even in our lighter wooded  species. It follows that the green wood of a sapling is heavier than  that of an old tree, the fresh wood from a disk of the upper part of a  tree is often heavier than that of the lower part, and the wood near  the bark heavier than that nearer the pith; and also that the  advantage of drying the wood before shipping is most important in  sappy and light kinds.    When kiln-dried, the misleading moisture factor of weight is uniformly  reduced, and a fair comparison possible. For the sake of convenience  in comparison, the weight of wood is expressed either as the weight  per cubic foot, or, what is still more convenient, as specific weight  or density. If an old long-leaf pine is cut up (as shown in Fig. 21)  the wood of disk No. 1 is heavier than that of disk No. 2, the latter  heavier than that of disk No. 3, and the wood of the top disk is found  to be only about three fourths as heavy as that of disk No. 1.  Similiarly, if disk No. 2 is cut up, as in the figure, the specific  weight of the different parts is:                  _a_, about 0.52                _b_, about 0.64                _c_, about 0.67      _d_, _e_, _f_, about 0.65    showing that in this disk at least the wood formed during the many  years' growth, represented in piece _a_, is much lighter than that of  former years. It also shows that the best wood is the middle part,  with its large proportion of dark summer bands.        [Illustration: Fig. 21. Orientation of Wood Samples.]    Cutting up all disks in the same way, it will be found that the piece  _a_ of the first disk is heavier than the piece _a_ of the fifth, and  that piece _c_ of the first disk excels the piece _c_ of all the other  disks. This shows that the wood grown during the same number of years  is lighter in the upper parts of the stem; and if the disks are  smoothed on the radial surfaces and set up one on top of the other in  their regular order, for the sake of comparison, this decrease in  weight will be seen to be accompanied by a decrease in the amount of  summer-wood. The color effect of the upper disks is conspicuously  lighter. If our old pine had been cut one hundred and fifty years ago,  before the outer, lighter wood was laid on, it is evident that the  weight of the wood of any one disk would have been found to increase  from the center outward, and no subsequent decrease could have been  observed.    In a thrifty young pine, then, the wood is heavier from the center  outward, and lighter from below upward; only the wood laid on in old  age falls in weight below the average. The number of brownish bands of  summer-wood are a direct indication of these differences. If an old  oak is cut up in the same manner, the butt cut is also found heaviest  and the top lightest, but, unlike the disk of pine, the disk of oak  has its firmest wood at the center, and each successive piece from the  center outward is lighter than its neighbor.    Examining the pieces, this difference is not as readily explained by  the appearance of each piece as in the case of pine wood.  Nevertheless, one conspicuous point appears at once. The pores, so  very distinct in oak, are very minute in the wood near the center, and  thus the wood is far less porous.    Studying different trees, it is found that in the pines, wood with  narrow rings is just as heavy as and often heavier than the wood with  wider rings; but if the rings are unusually narrow in any part of the  disk, the wood has a lighter color; that is, there is less summer-wood  and therefore less weight.    In oak, ash,"]]]
