[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32982"],[0,"Student's Hand-book of Mushrooms of America, Edible and Poisonous (#18)"],[1," recorded species of Pluteus have their habitat on tree stumps,  sawdust, or upon fallen timber. One species, Pluteus _cervinus_, is  recorded as edible, but not specially commended. Of Entoloma,  Worthington Smith says, \"It is allied to Tricholoma, though most of the  species are thinner and often brittle. It agrees also in structure with  Hebeloma and Hypholoma.\" None of the species are recorded as having  value as esculents.    The genus Bolbitius is described by Cooke as a small genus intermediate  between Agaricus and Coprinus on the one side, and Coprinus and  Cortinarius on the other. The species are small and ephemeral. Saccardo  places Bolbitius in his division Melanosporae, although the spores are  ochraceous.    In the section Pratelli Psalliota and Hypholoma contain mushrooms which  are of exceptionally fine flavor. In the first of these is found the  common field mushroom Agaricus campester and its allies.    The black-spored section Coprinarii contains two genera which include a  few recorded edible species, viz., Coprinus and Gomphidius. The  Psathyrellas correspond in size to the Mycenas in the white-spored  series and to the Psathyras in the purple-spored section; the gills are  free or adnate and turn black when mature. None of the species are  edible.    In Paneolus the plants are somewhat viscid when moist, the gills are  described as \"clouded, never becoming purple or brown.\" They are usually  found on manure heaps near cities. None are edible.    Saccardo in his Sylloge combines the Pratellae and Coprinarii, making of  them one section which he calls _Melanosporeae_.    G. Massee, the British mycologist, makes of the black-spored and the  purple and purplish-brown spored series two divisions, calling them,  respectively, _Porphyrosporeae_ and _Melanosporeae_.    The recorded edible species of the spore section Dermini are found in  Pholiota, Cortinarius, and Paxillus. The larger proportion of the  Pholiotas grow upon tree stumps. They have a fugacious, persistent  friable ring, and are liable to be confused with the Cortinarii, unless  attention is paid to the spidery veil and the iron-rust tint of the  spores of the latter. Only a few of the species are recorded as edible,  but none are known to be poisonous. Cortinarius is a large genus. It  contains a larger proportion of edible species than Pholiota, and none  are recorded as poisonous. The cobweb-like veil which extends from stem  to margin of cap in the young species, and the rust-colored spores which  dust the gills as the species mature, distinguish the genus from all  others.    A characteristic feature of Paxillus, and one which makes it easily  distinguishable from others of the same group, is the ease with which  the gills as a whole can be separated from the substance or fleshy  portion of the cap. There is an exception to this in the species  Paxillus involutus, recorded by Peck as edible.          POLYPOREI.      Hymenium lining the cavity of tubes or pores which are sometimes broken  up into teeth or concentric plates.--Berkeley's Outlines.    The plants of this second primary group or order of the family  Hymenomycetes exhibit a greater dissimilarity of form and texture than  do those of the Agaricini. Some of its genera consist almost wholly of  coriaceous or woody plants. A few contain fleshy ones. Some of the  species have a distinct stem, while others are stemless. With regard to  the receptacle in the plants of the genera _Boletus_, _Strobilomyces_,  etc., it forms a perfect cap, like that of the common Agaric, a cushion  of tubes taking the place of gills on the under surface of the cap, the  hymenium in this case lining the inner surface of the tubes from which  the spores drop when mature.    In some species, such as those of the genus Poria, the receptacle is  reduced to a single thin fibrous stratum, adhering closely to the matrix  and exposing a surface of crowded pores, and in others it consists of  fibrous strata formed in concentric layers.    A number of groups, each of which was treated in the original Friesian  classification as a single genus, have more recently been recognized as  comprising several distinct genera. In the Saccardian system the genera  Trametes, Daedalea, Merulius, Porothelium, and Fistulina still retain the  generic rank assigned to them by Fries, but the old genus Boletus is  subdivided into four genera, Boletus, Strobilomyces, Boletinus, and  Gyrodon, while Polyporus, originally a very large genus, is subdivided  into the genera Polyporus, Fomes, Polystictus, and Poria. This  arrangement was in part suggested by Fries in his later works, and is  accepted by M. C. Cooke, as indicated in his latest work on fungi.    Quoting M. C. Cooke, \"_Strobilomyces_ is _Boletus_ with a rough warty  and scaly pileus; _Boletinus_ is _Boletus_ with short, large radiating  pores; and _Gyrodon_ is _Boletus_ with elongated sinuate irregular  pores, all fleshy, firm fungi of robust habit, possessing stem and cap.\"  The species of the genus Polyporus as now restricted are somewhat fleshy  in the young stage, shrinking as they mature and dry, and becoming  indurated with age. In Fomes the species, of woody consistency from the  first, have no room for shrinkage, and are quite rigid; the tubes being  in strata, and the strata growing yearly, the species are virtually  perennial. The pileus of the plant shows a rigid polished crust  resulting from resinous exudations.    In Polystictus the plants are usually small, thin, tough, and irregular  in outline, the tubes exceedingly short, with thin walls, which easily  split up, giving the pores at times a toothed or fringed appearance. The  surface is velvety, or hairy, and zoned in varying colors. They are very  common upon decaying tree stumps, often covering the surface of the  stump in gaily colored layers. Not esculent.    Poria is composed of resupinate species with the pores normally in a  single series, the whole stratum spread over, and adhering to the  matrix. The species are coriaceous or woody. Not esculent.    The plants of the genus Trametes allied to Fomes are epiphytal, with the  trama the same in substance and color as the hymenophore. The tubes do  not form in regular strata, but are sunk into the substance of the  pileus. The plants are coriaceous, and none are edible.    Daedalea closely resembles _Trametes_ with the tubes forming deep  labyrinthiform depressions. Whole plant woody, sessile.    Hexagonia, allied by its characteristics to Polystictus, has large  hexagonal pores, with firm, entire dissepiments.    In Favolus the plants are slightly fleshy and substipitate with the  pores angular, and radiating from the stem. Not edible.    The species of the genus Laschia are recognized by the shallow  irregular pores and the vein like character of their dissepiments (or  pore walls). Substance slightly gelatinous.    In the plants of Porothelium, irregular papillae take the place of tubes,  and the plants are sub-membranaceous and resupinate, having the habit of  those of Poria.    The genus Merulius has been termed the lowest and most imperfect of the  genera of Polyporei. It presents a soft, waxy spore-bearing surface,  reticulated with obtuse folds. Solenia, by early authors placed in  Discomycetes, thence transferred to Auricularini, and by some authors  associated with Cyphella in Theleporei, now finds place as one of the  genera of Polyporei as given by Saccardo.    The above-mentioned genera, together with Myriadoporus, Ceriomyces,  Bresadolia, Theleporus, Gloeporus, and Cyclomyces, constitute the  Polyporeae of the Saccardian system.    _Myriadoporus_ is a North American genus. It is a form of the genus  Polyporus, but with pores in the _interior_ as well as on the _exterior_  surface. _Ceriomyces_ is generally regarded as a spurious genus. It is  similar to _Myriadoporus_, but with internal pores and only spurious  pores externally. Of _Bresadolia_ Cooke says \"there is only one  described species, and of this only one specimen has been found.\"  _Theleporus_ is an African genus of which only one species is known.  _Gloeporus_ is a form of resupinate Polyporus, except that the  hymenium or pore-bearing surface is gelatinous instead of being firm.  _Cyclomyces_ is a genus with some features of Lenzites; it is leathery.  All of these are more or less coriaceous. None are edible. _Campbellia_  is a new genus. It is _Merulius_ with a pileus and central stem.    The edible Polyporeae are found in the genera Boletus, Strobilomyces,  Gyrodon, Boletinus, Polyporus, and Fistulina. Of these, the first four  genera contain most of the edible species as well as a few which have  been regarded as unwholesome or poisonous.    In the genus Polyporus as now restricted, the species Polyporus  _sulphureus_ Fries is perhaps the one most likely to be selected for  table use, the others becoming very quickly indurated or tough, and this  should be gathered when very young, as in maturity it loses its fleshy  consistency and becomes dry and tough. It is common on old tree stumps  and is often found on the dead wood of living trees, the bright yellow  and vivid orange red tints which characterize the young plant making it  very conspicuous.    It is easily recognized by its irregular, closely overlapping frond-like  caps, white flesh, and the very small sulphur-yellow tubes. The spores  are white, elliptical. The flesh of young specimens is somewhat juicy.    The geographical distribution is wide, and in places where a moist, warm  temperature prevails plants of this species often attain very large  proportions, sometimes completely encircling the trunk of a tree at its  base. The bright colors fade as the plant matures, and the plant  becomes indurated and friable, when very old crumbling readily in the  hands.    To prepare for the table, very thin slices of young specimens should be  cut and either allowed to slowly simmer on the back of the range, or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33029"],[0,"Ducks and Geese (#18)"],[1,"Last Feed for Market Ducks._ It is important in order to have the  dressed ducklings appear to the best advantage and also in order to  insure their keeping qualities as much as possible that they should have  no feed in their crops when they are killed. This means that if they are  to be killed in the morning, which is the usual practice, they should be  fed for the last time the previous night. If, however, they are not to  be killed until afternoon they can be fed lightly in the morning.    _Sorting Market Ducklings._ When a pen of ducklings which are being  fattened are deemed ready to be killed they are driven up to the killing  house and a few of them at a time driven into a small pen where it is  easy to catch and examine them. Each duck as it is caught is examined to  make sure that it is in proper market condition. The examination  consists of feeling of the duck's body to see that it has a good smooth  breast so that the breast bone cannot be readily felt. If it is in that  condition it is ready to kill. Ducks which do not show this condition  are thrown out and returned to the yards where they are fed for a longer  period unless it is desired to ship them alive.    At the proper season of the year when breeders for the next season are  to be selected, suitable birds for that purpose are picked out from the  market lots as they are examined. In any lot of ducks there will be  found some cripples. It is common practice to sort these out and group  them together in a pen by themselves where they are held until they are  in suitable condition for marketing. It is doubtful whether it pays to  hold these cripples as they are hard to get in good condition and in  many cases are probably kept and fed at a loss. Some ducklings will show  twisted wings but as a rule they are thrifty and will fatten readily and  be in good market condition.    [Illustration: FIG. 39. Awaiting slaughter. The fattened ducklings are  driven into these catching pens. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal  Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    [Illustration: FIG. 40. Carrying the ducklings from the catching pen to  the killing place. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U.  S. Department of Agriculture._)]    _Killing._ As the ducklings suitable for killing are selected, 10 or 12  of them, depending upon the capacity of the killing room, are hung up by  their feet, the head being fastened down by means of a hook or else  weighted down by means of a blood can hung from a hook inserted through  the bill. By means of a long, narrow bladed sharp knife the veins in the  throat just beyond the skull are severed so as to cause free bleeding.  The blood flows either into the blood can or into a trough above which  the birds are hung. The birds are not stuck or brained unless it is  desired to dry pick them nor are they as a rule stunned by hitting them  on the head before bleeding. In some states, however, the law requires  that all birds bled shall first be stunned in this manner. The bleeding  of the ducks causes their death and they are allowed to hang until they  are thoroughly bled out. They are then taken down, the blood washed off  of their heads and placed on a table or on the floor convenient to the  pickers, other ducks being hung in their places.    [Illustration: FIG. 41. The ducks are hung by the feet and the veins in  the neck cut from inside the mouth to cause free bleeding. (_Photograph  from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    [Illustration: FIG. 42. After the throat veins are cut, the ducks are  allowed to hang until they are well bled out. The blood is caught in the  trough below. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.  Department of Agriculture._)]    [Illustration: FIG. 43. Ducks which have been bled, ready to have the  blood washed from their heads and mouths before they are picked.  (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of  Agriculture._)]    [Illustration: FIG. 44. After they are bled and washed, the ducks are  laid in the picking room ready for the pickers. (_Photograph from the  Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    _Scalding._ The picker selects a duck from the table where they are  placed after being taken down and carries it to a large kettle of water  which is maintained at a temperature just below boiling. They are  thoroughly soused in this water holding them by the head and feet so as  to allow the water to penetrate into the feathers until they can be  readily plucked. The picker tests the readiness with which the feathers  come out by plucking a few from the breast or body and thus determines  whether the scalding is sufficient or whether more is required. Care is  taken not to dip the feet or head in the water as this might discolor  these parts. Practically all market ducks from Long Island are scald  picked at the present time. Dry picking which is demanded in some  markets such as Boston makes a somewhat better looking carcass and also  increases the value of the feathers, but is generally considered too  slow and too highly skilled a process for use on the average duck farm.    [Illustration: FIG. 45. Holding the head in one hand and the feet in the  other, the picker dips the duck in water heated nearly to the boiling  point and souses well to work the water into the feathers until they  pluck easily. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.  Department of Agriculture._)]    _Picking._. After scalding the picker starts removing the feathers. In  doing this the duck is held either on the lap or on a board nailed to  the side of the feather box. The feathers on the breast are picked  first, then working down toward the tail, pulling the feathers with the  grain. The soft body feathers as plucked are thrown into the feather  box, the coarser feathers being thrown on the floor. The main wing and  tail feathers are left on as are likewise some of the feathers of the  neck next the head.    The most troublesome part of picking ducks is removing the down. This  may be removed to some extent by rubbing with the hand although care  must be taken not to bruise the skin severely. In some cases the down is  shaved off with a sharp knife. In some of the commercial packing houses  the duck's body is sprinkled with powdered rosin and then dipped into  the hot water. This melts the rosin so that the down and rosin can be  rubbed off easily with the hand leaving the body clean. Pin feathers  are usually removed by grasping them between the thumb and a dull knife.    In some packing houses, ducks are steamed before picking. Where this is  done they are picked clean and the wing and tail feathers are pulled  before steaming takes place. Six or eight ducks which have been bled are  hung at the same time in the top of a steam box or barrel which can be  made air-tight and the steam turned on until the soft feathers of the  breast come off easily. The length of time to steam depends on the  temperature of the steam itself and varies from one-half to 2 minutes.  In some cases the ducks are hung in a steam box with the heads outside  so as to prevent the steam from coming into contact with the heads,  possibly discoloring them.    On Long Island women are used very largely for picking and they secure  for this service 6 cents per duck. A good picker should do 75 ducks or  even more a day. The value of the feathers will slightly more than pay  for the cost of picking.    Picking usually begins early in the morning about 6 o'clock and is  generally finished by noon or soon after. Most duck raisers figure on  doing their killing and picking during the first half of the week and do  not like to kill if they can help it during the latter days of the week.    [Illustration: FIG. 46. Picking the ducks. (_Photograph from the Bureau  of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    _Dry Picking._ Where the market requires it, the ducks must be dry  picked. In doing this the procedure is the same as in dry picking  chickens. After the cut is made to bleed the ducks, the point of the  knife is plunged through the roof of the mouth until it reaches the  brain when it is turned to cause a paralysis of the muscles which  enables the feathers to be plucked more easily. The duck is then struck  on the back of the head with a club to stun it and make it easier to  handle when picking. The picker seats himself by the feather box, with  the duck on his lap, holding the head pressed against the outside of the  box and held there by the picker's leg. He then proceeds immediately and  as quickly as possible to pluck the feathers. It is necessary to  accomplish this without delay, for the feathers soon set and are then  much harder to pluck and are more likely to result in tears in the skin.  When removing the down, the hand is moistened when much of the down can  be rubbed off. Pin feathers are removed by grasping them between the  thumb and the edge of a dull knife and any which cannot be gotten in  this way are shaved off with a sharp knife. After picking, the carcasses  are cooled in cold water the same as the scalded birds.    _Cooling._ After the birds are plucked they are thrown into cold water  and are left there for several hours or until the body heat is entirely  removed. It is most important that this be thoroughly accomplished for  if any body heat is left in the carcasses they are almost sure to become  green-struck when packed. The length of time that they must be left  in the water depends upon the weather conditions. If the weather is warm  so that the water is not very cool it is necessary to add ice in order  to hasten the cooling and to accomplish it thoroughly. Cooling in water  also serves to plump the carcasses somewhat.    _Packing._ After the ducks are thoroughly cooled they are removed from  the water and packed. Long Island ducklings are usually packed in  barrels."]]]
