COMBINING DIFFERENT TOUCHES    \"As I have intimated, if the fingers are used exclusively a terribly dry  tone must result. The full-arm touch, in which I experience a complete  relaxation of the arm from the shoulder to the finger tips, is the  condition I employ at most times. But the touches I use are combinations  of the different finger, hand and arm touches. These lead to myriads of  results, and only the experienced performer can judge where they should  be applied to produce desired effects.    \"You will observe by placing your hand upon my shoulder that even with  the movement of the single finger a muscular activity may be detected at  the shoulder. This shows how completely relaxed I keep my entire arm  during performance. It is only in this way that I can produce the right  kind of singing tone in cantabile passages. Sometimes I use one touch in  one voice and an entirely different touch in another voice. The  combinations are kaleidoscopic in their multiplicity.      MECHANICAL METHODS DANGEROUS    \"I have never been in favor of the many automatic and mechanical methods  of producing touch. They are all dangerous to my mind. There is only one  real way of teaching, and that is through the sense of hearing of the  pupil. The teacher should go to the piano and produce the desired tonal  effect, and the pupil should listen and watch the teacher. Then the  pupil should be instructed to secure a similar result, and the teacher  should persevere until the audible effect is nearly the same. If the  pupil, working empirically, does not discover the means leading to this  effect, the teacher should call the pupil's attention to some of the  physical conditions leading to the result. If the teacher is unable to  play well enough to illustrate this, and to secure the right kind of  touch from his pupils, he has no business to be a teacher of advanced  students. All the theory in the world will never lead to the proper  results.    \"Rubinstein paid little or no attention to the theory of touch, and, in  fact, he frequently stated that he cared little about such things, but  who could hear Rubinstein's touch without being benefited? I believe  that in teaching touch the teacher should first give his model of the  touch required and then proceed from this positive ideal, by means of  the so-called Socratic method of inducing the pupil to produce a similar  result through repeated questions. In this way the pupil will not be  obliged to resign his individuality, as would be the case if he followed  strict technical injunctions and rules.      STUDENTS SHOULD HEAR VIRTUOSOS    \"For the same reason it is advisable for the pupil to hear many fine  pianists. He should never miss an opportunity to attend the concerts of  great virtuosos. I can frankly say that I have learned as much from  hearing the concerts of great performers as I have from any other source  of educational inspiration. The pupil should listen intelligently and  earnestly. When he hears what appeals to him as a particularly fine  tonal effect, he should endeavor to note the means the pianist employs  to produce this effect.    \"He must, however, learn to discriminate between affection or needless  movement and the legitimate means to an end. Consequent upon a relaxed  full arm is the occasional dropping of the wrist below the level of the  keyboard. A few great players practice this at a public recital, and lo!  and behold! a veritable cult of 'wrist-droppers' arises and we see  students raising and lowering the wrist with exaggerated mechanical  stiffness and entirely ignoring the important end in which this wrist  dropping was only an incident.      METHODS, AND STILL MORE METHODS    \"I am continually amused at the thousand and one different ways of  striking the keys that teachers devise and then attach with the label  'method.' These varied contortions are, after all, largely a matter of  vision, and have little effect upon the real musical results that the  composition demands. Touch, as I have previously said, all comes down to  the question of the degree of weight applied to the keyboard and the  degree of quickness with which it is applied. In rapid octave and  staccato passages the hand touch is largely used. This is the touch  most dependent upon local muscular activity. Aside from this the  combination of muscular and weight touch almost invariably obtain.      DON'T NEGLECT EAR TRAINING    \"I desire to reiterate that if the ideal touch is presented to the  pupil's mind, through the medium of the ear, he will be much more  successful in attaining the artistic ends required. The pupil must  realize clearly _what is good_ and _what is bad_, and his _aural sense_  must be continually educated in this respect. He should practice slowly  and carefully at the keyboard until he is convinced that his arm is at  all times relaxed. He cannot make his sense of touch too sensitive. He  should even be able to sense the weight or upward pressure which brings  the pianoforte key back into position after it has been depressed. The  arm should feel as if it were floating, and should never be tense.    \"When I am playing I do not think of the arm motion. I am, of course,  absorbed in the composition being performed. A relaxed arm has become  second nature to me. It comes by itself. Players are rarely able to tell  just how they produce their results. There are too many contributing  factors. Even with the best-known performers the effects differ at  different performances. It is impossible for the performer to give a  program repeatedly in identically the same manner. If he did succeed in  doing this, his playing would soon become stereotyped.    \"The teacher should, from the very beginning, seek to avoid stiffness  and bad hand positions, such as crooked fingers or broken-in knuckles.  If these details are neglected the pupil is liable to go through his  entire musical career greatly hampered. I would earnestly advise all  teachers to discourage the efforts of pupils to attain virtuoso heights  unless they are convinced beyond the possibility of a doubt that the  pupil has marvelous talent. The really great performers seem to be  endowed with a 'God-given' insight in the matter of both technic and  touch. They are unquestionably born for it. They possess the right  mental and physical capacity for success. No amount of training would  make a Normandy dray horse that could compete with a Kentucky  thoroughbred on the race course. It is a pitiful sight to watch students  who could not possibly become virtuosos slave year after year before an  ivory and ebony tread-mill, when, if they realized their lack of  personal qualifications, they could engage in teaching or in some other  professional or mercantile line and take a delight in their music as an  avocation that they would never find in professional playing.      ARTISTIC INTERPRETATION PARAMOUNT    \"To some, the matter of touch is of little significance. They are  apparently born with an appreciation of tonal values that others might  work years to attain in vain. Those who imagine that touch is entirely  a matter of finger tips are greatly mistaken. The ear is quite as  important as the organs employed in administering the touch to the  keyboard. The pianist should in reality not think of the muscles and  nerves in his arm, nor of the ivory and ebony keys, nor of the hammers  and strings in the interior of the instrument. He should think first and  always of the kind of tone he is eliciting from the instrument, and  determine whether it is the most appropriate tonal quality for the  proper interpretation of the piece he is playing. He must, of course,  spend years of hard thought and study in cultivating this ability to  judge and produce the right touch, but the performer who is more  concerned about the technical claims of a composition than its musical  interpretation can only hope to give an uninteresting, uninspired,  stilted performance that should rightly drive all intelligent hearers  from his audience hall.\"      QUESTIONS IN STYLE, INTERPRETATION, EXPRESSION  AND TECHNIC OF PIANOFORTE PLAYING    SERIES VII    OSSIP GABRILOWITSCH    1.

LEOPOLD GODOWSKY    BIOGRAPHICAL    Leopold Godowsky was born at Wilna, Russia (Russian Poland), February  13, 1870. His father was a physician. When Godowsky was nine years old  he made his first public appearance as a pianist and met with  instantaneous success--success so great that a tour of Germany and  Poland was arranged for the child. When thirteen he entered the Royal  High School for Music in Berlin as the _protege_ of a rich banker of  Koenigsberg. There he studied under Bargeil and Rudorff. In 1884 he  toured America together with Ovide Musin, the violin virtuoso. Two years  later he became the pupil of Saint-Saens in Paris. In 1887 and 1888 he  toured France and visited London, where he received a command to appear  at the British Court. In 1890 he returned to America and made this  country his home for ten years, appearing frequently in concert and  engaging in several tours. In 1894-1895 he became head of the piano  department of the South Broad Street"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28039"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume II (#18)"],[1,"       clamor for compromise. Be it understood that it is a Woman's       Rights matter; for the Woman's Rights women have the same right       to dictate to a Loyal League that the Anti-Woman's Rights women       have, and the side that is strongest will carry the resolution,       of course. But do not withdraw it. Do not say, \"We will take it       away because it is objectionable.\"         I want the people to understand that this Loyal League--because       it is a Loyal League--must of necessity bring in Anti-Slavery and       Woman's Rights. (Applause). Is it possible that any of you       believe that there is such a being in this country to-day as a       loyal man or woman who is not anti-slavery to the backbone?       (Applause). Neither is there a loyal man or woman whose intellect       is clear enough to take in a broad, large idea, who is not to the       very core a Woman's Rights man or woman. (Applause).         MRS. HOYT: As I have said before, I am not opposed to       Anti-Slavery. I stand here an Abolitionist from the earliest       childhood, and a stronger anti-slavery woman lives not on the       soil of America. (Applause). I voted Yea on the anti-slavery       resolution, and I would vote it ten times over. But, at the same       time, in the West, which I represent, there is a very strong       objection to Woman's Rights; in fact, this Woman's Rights matter       is odious to some of us from the _manner_ in which it has been       conducted; not that we object to the philosophy--we believe in       the philosophy--but object to this matter being tacked on to a       purely loyal convention.... I will make one more statement which       bears upon the point which I have been trying to make. I have       never before spoken except in private meetings, and therefore       must ask the indulgence of the audience. The women of Madison,       Wisconsin, feeling the necessity and importance of doing       something more than women were doing to assist the Government in       this struggle, organized a Ladies' Union League, which has been       in operation some time, and is very efficient.         A VOICE:--What are they doing? Please state.         MRS. HOYT: In Madison we had a very large and flourishing       \"Soldiers' Aid Society.\" We were the headquarters for that part       of the State. A great many ladies worked in our Aid Society, and       assisted us, who utterly refused to join with the Loyal League,       because, they said, it would damage the Aid Society. We       recognized that fact, and kept it purely distinct as a Ladies'       Loyal League, for the promotion of the loyal sentiment of the       North, and to reach the soldiers in the field by the most direct       and practical means which were in our power. We have a great many       very flourishing Ladies' Loyal Leagues throughout the West, and       we have kept them sacred from Anti-Slavery, Woman's Rights,       Temperance, and everything else, good though they may be. In our       League we have three objects in view. The first is, retrenchment       in household expenses, to the end that the material resources of       the Government may be, so far as possible, applied to the entire       and thorough vindication of its authority. Second, to strengthen       the loyal sentiment of the people at home, and instil a deeper       love of the national flag. The third and most important object       is, to write to the soldiers in the field, thus reaching nearly       every private in the army, to encourage and stimulate him in the       way that ladies know how to do. I state again, it is not an       Anti-Slavery objection. I will vote for every Anti-Slavery       movement in this Convention. I object to the Woman's Rights       resolutions, and nothing else.         ERNESTINE L. ROSE: It is exceedingly amusing to hear persons talk       about throwing out Woman's Rights, when, if it had not been for       Woman's Rights, that lady would not have had the courage to stand       here and say what she did. (Applause). Pray, what means \"loyal\"?       Loyal means to be true to one's highest conviction. Justice, like       charity, begins at home. It is because we are loyal to truth,       loyal to justice, loyal to right, loyal to humanity, that woman       is included in that resolution. Now, what does this discussion       mean? The lady acknowledges that it is not against Woman's Rights       itself; she is _for_ Woman's Rights. We are here to endeavor to       help the cause of human rights and human freedom. We ought not to       be afraid. You may depend upon it, if there are any of those who       are called copperheads--but I don't like to call names, for even       a copperhead is better than no head at all--(laughter)--if there       are any copperheads here, I am perfectly sure they will object to       this whole Convention; and if we want to consult them, let us       adjourn _sine die_. If we are loyal to our highest convictions,       we need not care how far it may lead. For truth, like water, will       find its own level. No, friends, in the name of consistency let       us not wrangle here simply because we associate the name of woman       with human justice and human rights. Although I always like to       see opposition on any subject, for it elicits truth much better       than any speech, still I think it will be exceedingly       inconsistent if, because some women out in the West are opposed       to the Woman's Rights movement--though at the same time they take       advantage of it--that therefore we shall throw it out of this       resolution.         MRS. SPENCE, of New York: I didn't come to this meeting to       participate--only to listen. I don't claim to be a Northerner or       a Southerner; but I claim to be a human being, and to belong to       the human family (Applause). I belong to no sect or creed of       politics or religion; I stand as an individual, defending the       rights of every one as far as I can see them. It seems to me we       have met here to come to some unity of action. If we attempt to       bring in religious, political, or moral questions, we all must of       necessity differ. We came here hoping to be inspired by each       other to lay some plan by which we can unite in practical action.       I have not heard such a proposition made; but I anticipate that       it will be. (Hear, hear). Then if we are to unite on some       proposition which is to be presented, it seems to me that our       resolutions should be practical and directed to the main       business. Let the object of the meeting be unity of action and       expression in behalf of what we feel to be the highest right, our       highest idea of liberty.         THE PRESIDENT (Lucy Stone): Every good cause can afford to be       just. The lady from Wisconsin, who differs from some of us here,       says she is an Anti-Slavery woman. We ought to believe her. She       accepts the principles of the Woman's Rights movement, but she       does not like the way in which it has been carried on. We ought       to believe her. It is not, then, that she objects to the idea of       the equality of women and negroes, but because she does not wish       to have anything \"tacked on\" to the Loyal League, that to the       mass of people does not seem to belong there. She seems to me to       stand precisely in the position of those good people just at the       close of the war of the Revolution. The people then, as now, had       their hearts aching with the memory of their buried dead. They       had had years of war from which they had garnered out sorrows as       well as hopes; and when they came to establish a Union, they       found that one black, unmitigated curse of slavery rooted in the       soil. Some men said, \"We can have no true Union where there is       not justice to the negro. The black man is a human being, like       us, with the same equal rights.\" They had given to the world the       Declaration of Independence, grand and brave and beautiful. They       said, \"How can we form a true Union?\" Some people representing       the class that Mrs. Hoyt represents, answered, \"Let us have a       Union. We are weak; we have been beset for seven long years; do       not let us meddle with the negro question. What we are for is a       Union; let us have a Union at all hazards.\" There were earnest       men, men of talent, who could speak well and earnestly, and they       persuaded the others to silence. So they said nothing about       slavery, and let the wretched monster live.         To-day, over all our land, the unburied bones of our fathers and       sons and brothers tell the sad mistake that those men made when       long ago The babes we bear in anguish and carry in our arms are       not ours. The few rights that we have, have been wrung from the       Legislature by t they left this one great wrong in the land. They       could not accomplish good by passing over a wrong. If the right       of one single human being is to be disregarded by us, we fail in       our loyalty to the country. All over this land women have no       political existence. Laws pass over our heads that we can not       unmake. Our property is taken from us without our consent. The       babes we bear in anguish and carry in our arms are not ours. The       few rights that we have, have been wrung from the Legislature by       the Woman's Rights movement. We come to-day to say to those who       are administering our Government and fighting our battles, \"While       you are going through this valley of humiliation, do not forget       that you must be true alike to the women and the negroes.\" We can       never be truly \"loyal\" if we leave them out. Leave them out, and       we take the same backward step that our fathers took when they       left out slavery. If justice to the negro and to woman is right,"]]]
