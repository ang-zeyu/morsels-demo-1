Tum capiatur & angulus D  ad angulum B, ut est sinus iste anguli ACQ ad Radium, & angulus E ad  angulum N - ACQ + D, ut est longitudo L ad longitudinem eandem L cosinu  anguli ACQ + ½D diminutam, ubi angulus iste recto minor est, auctam ubi  major. Postea capiatur tum angulus F ad angulum B, ut est sinus anguli ACQ  + E ad radium, tum angulus G ad angulum N - ACQ - E + F ut est longitudo L  ad Longitudinem eandem cosinu anguli ACQ + E + ½F diminutam ubi angulus  iste recto minor est, auctam ubi major.

The novel and important idea contained in it, however, it was  at that time premature to attempt to develop. But though many of the  subtler suggestions of Herschel's genius passed unnoticed by his  contemporaries, the main result of his solar researches was an  unmistakable one. It was nothing less than the definitive introduction  into astronomy of the paradoxical conception of the central fire and  hearth of our system as a cold, dark, terrestrial mass, wrapt in a  mantle of innocuous radiance--an earth, so to speak, within--a sun  without.    Let us pause for a moment to consider the value of this remarkable  innovation. It certainly was not a step in the direction of truth. On  the contrary, the crude notions of Anaxagoras and Xeno approached more  nearly to what we now know of the sun, than the complicated structure  devised for the happiness of a nobler race of beings than our own by the  benevolence of eighteenth-century astronomers. And yet it undoubtedly  constituted a very important advance in science. It was the first  earnest attempt to bring solar phenomena within the compass of a  rational system; to put together into a consistent whole the facts  ascertained; to fabricate, in short, a solar machine that would in some  fashion work. It is true that the materials were inadequate and the  design faulty. The resulting construction has not proved strong enough  to stand the wear and tear of time and discovery, but has had to be  taken to pieces and remodelled on a totally different plan. But the work  was not therefore done in vain. None of Bacon's aphorisms show a clearer  insight into the relations between the human mind and the external world  than that which declares \"Truth to emerge sooner from error than from  confusion.\"[144] A definite theory (even if a false one) gives  holding-ground to thought. Facts acquire a meaning with reference to it.  It affords a motive for accumulating them and a means of co-ordinating  them; it provides a framework for their arrangement, and a receptacle  for their preservation, until they become too strong and numerous to be  any longer included within arbitrary limits, and shatter the vessel  originally framed to contain them.    Such was the purpose subserved by Herschel's theory of the sun. It  helped to _clarify_ ideas on the subject. The turbid sense of groping  and viewless ignorance gave place to the lucidity of a possible scheme.  The persuasion of knowledge is a keen incentive to its increase. Few men  care to investigate what they are obliged to admit themselves entirely  ignorant of; but once started on the road of knowledge, real or  supposed, they are eager to pursue it. By the promulgation of a  confident and consistent view regarding the nature of the sun,  accordingly, research was encouraged, because it was rendered hopeful,  and inquirers were shown a path leading indefinitely onwards where an  impassable thicket had before seemed to bar the way.    We have called the \"terrestrial\" theory of the sun's nature an  innovation, and so, as far as its general acceptance is concerned, it  may justly be termed; but, like all successful innovations, it was a  long time brewing. It is extremely curious to find that Herschel had a  predecessor in its advocacy who never looked through a telescope (nor,  indeed, imagined the possibility of such an instrument), who knew  nothing of sun-spots, was still (mistaken assertions to the contrary  notwithstanding) in the bondage of the geocentric system, and regarded  nature from the lofty standpoint of an idealist philosophy. This was the  learned and enlightened Cardinal Cusa, a fisherman's son from the banks  of the Moselle, whose distinguished career in the Church and in  literature extended over a considerable part of the fifteenth century  (1401-64). In his singular treatise _De Docta Ignorantia_, one of the  most notable literary monuments of the early Renaissance, the following  passage occurs:--\"To a spectator on the surface of the sun, the  splendour which appears to us would be invisible, since it contains, as  it were, an earth for its central mass, with a circumferential envelope  of light and heat, and between the two an atmosphere of water and clouds  and translucent air.\" The luminary of Herschel's fancy could scarcely be  more clearly portrayed; some added words, however, betray the origin of  the Cardinal's idea. \"The earth also,\" he says, \"would appear as a  shining star to any one outside the fiery element.\" It was, in fact, an  extension to the sun of the ancient elemental doctrine; but an extension  remarkable at that period, as premonitory of the tendency, so powerfully  developed by subsequent discoveries, to assimilate the orbs of heaven to  the model of our insignificant planet, and to extend the brotherhood of  our system and our species to the farthest limit of the visible or  imaginable universe.    In later times we find Flamsteed communicating to Newton, March 7, 1681,  his opinion \"that the substance of the sun is terrestrial matter, his  light but the liquid menstruum encompassing him.\"[145] Bode in 1776  arrived independently at the conclusion that \"the sun is neither burning  nor glowing, but in its essence a dark planetary body, composed like our  earth of land and water, varied by mountains and valleys, and enveloped  in a vaporous atmosphere\";[146] and the learned in general applauded and  acquiesced. The view, however, was in 1787 still so far from popular,  that the holding of it was alleged as a proof of insanity in Dr. Elliot  when accused of a murderous assault on Miss Boydell. His friend Dr.  Simmons stated on his behalf that he had received from him in the  preceding January a letter giving evidence of a deranged mind, wherein  he asserted \"that the sun is not a body of fire, as hath been hitherto  supposed, but that its light proceeds from a dense and universal aurora,  which may afford ample light to the inhabitants of the surface beneath,  and yet be at such a distance aloft as not to annoy them. No objection,  he saith, ariseth to that great luminary's being inhabited; vegetation  may obtain there as well as with us. There may be water and dry land,  hills and dales, rain and fair weather; and as the light, so the season  must be eternal, consequently it may easily be conceived to be by far  the most blissful habitation of the whole system!\" The Recorder,  nevertheless, objected that if an extravagant hypothesis were to be  adduced as proof of insanity, the same might hold good with regard to  some other speculators, and desired Dr. Simmons to tell the court what  he thought of the theories of Burnet and Buffon.[147]    Eight years later, this same \"extravagant hypothesis,\" backed by the  powerful recommendation of Sir William Herschel, obtained admittance to  the venerable halls of science, there to abide undisturbed for nearly  seven decades. Individual objectors, it is true, made themselves heard,  but their arguments had little effect on the general body of opinion.  Ruder blows were required to shatter an hypothesis flattering to human  pride of invention in its completeness, in the plausible detail of  observations by which it seemed to be supported, and in its  condescension to the natural pleasure in discovering resemblance under  all but total dissimilarity.    Sir John Herschel included among the results of his multifarious labours  at the Cape of Good Hope a careful study of the sun-spots conspicuously  visible towards the end of the year 1836 and in the early part of 1837.  They were remarkable, he tells us, for their forms and arrangement, as  well as for their number and size; one group, measured on the 29th of  March in the latter year, covering (apart from what may be called its  outlying dependencies) the vast area of five square minutes or 3,780  million square miles.[148] We have at present to consider, however, not  so much these observations in themselves, as the chain of theoretical  suggestions by which they were connected. The distribution of spots, it  was pointed out, on two zones parallel to the equator, showed plainly  their intimate connection with the solar rotation, and indicated as  their cause fluid circulations analogous to those producing the  terrestrial trade and anti-trade winds.    \"The spots, in this view of the subject,\" he went on to say,[149] \"would  come to be assimilated to those regions on the earth's surface where,  for the moment, hurricanes and tornadoes prevail; the upper stratum  being temporarily carried downwards, displacing by its impetus the two  strata of luminous matter beneath, the upper of course to a greater  extent than the lower, and thus wholly or partially denuding the opaque  surface of the sun below. Such processes cannot be unaccompanied by  vorticose motions, which, left to themselves, die away by degrees and  dissipate, with the peculiarity that their lower portions come to rest  more speedily than their upper, by reason of the greater resistance  below, as well as the remoteness from the point of action, which lies in  a higher region, so that their centres (as seen in our waterspouts,  which are nothing but small tornadoes) appear to retreat upwards. Now  this agrees perfectly with what is observed during the obliteration of  the solar spots, which appear as if filled in by the collapse of their  sides, the penumbra closing in upon the spot and disappearing after "]]]
