For instance, not five minutes ago I heard two men  quarreling in the street, and one said to the other, \"Only let me get  hold of your beggarly carcass once, and I will use you up so small that  God Almighty himself cannot see your _ghost!_\"    To live thus, in constant danger of being hushed to one's rosy rest by  a ghastly lullaby of oaths, is revolting in the extreme. For that  reason, and because it is infinitely more comfortable during the winter  season than a plank house, F. has concluded to build a log cabin,  where, at least, I shall not be _obliged_ to hear the solemn names of  the Father and the dear Master so mockingly profaned.    But it is not the swearing alone which disturbs my slumber. There is a  dreadful flume, the machinery of which keeps up the most dismal moaning  and shrieking all the livelong night, painfully suggestive of a  suffering child. But, O dear! you don't know what that is, do you? Now,  if I were scientific, I should give you such a vivid description of it  that you would see a pen-and-ink flume staring at you from this very  letter. But, alas! my own ideas on the subject are in a state of  melancholy vagueness. I will do the best possible, however, in the way  of explanation. A flume, then, is an immense trough which takes up a  portion of the river, and with the aid of a dam compels it to run in  another channel, leaving the vacated bed of the stream ready for mining  purposes.    There is a gigantic project now on the tapis, of fluming the entire  river for many miles, commencing a little above Rich Bar. Sometimes  these fluming companies are eminently successful; at others, their  operations are a dead failure.    But, in truth, the whole mining system in California is one great  gambling or, better perhaps, lottery transaction. It is impossible to  tell whether a claim will prove valuable or not. F. has invariably sunk  money in every one that he has bought. Of course a man who works a  claim himself is more likely, even should it turn out poor, to get his  money back, as they say, than one who, like F., hires it done.    A few weeks since, F. paid a thousand dollars for a claim which has  proved utterly worthless. He might better have thrown his money into  the river than to have bought it, and yet some of the most experienced  miners on the Bar thought that it would pay.    But I began to tell you about the different noises which disturb my  peace of mind by day and my repose of body by night, and have gone,  instead, into a financial disquisition upon mining prospects. Pray  forgive me, even though I confess that I intend, some day, when I feel  statistically inclined, to bore you with some profound remarks upon the  claiming, drifting, sluicing, ditching, fluming, and coyoting politics  of the \"diggins.\"    But to return to my sleep-murderers. The rolling on the bowling-alley  never leaves off for ten consecutive minutes at any time during the  entire twenty-four hours. It is a favorite amusement at the mines, and  the only difference that Sunday makes is, that then it never leaves off  for _one_ minute.    Besides the flume and the bowling-alley, there is an inconsiderate dog  which _will_ bark from starry eve till dewy morn. I fancy that he has a  wager on the subject, as all the other _puppies_ seem bitten by the  betting mania.    Apropos of dogs, I found dear old Dake, the noble Newfoundland which H.  gave us, look as intensely black and as grandly aristocratical as ever.  He is the only high-bred dog on the river. There is another animal, by  the plebeian name of John (what a name for a _dog!_), really a handsome  creature, which looks as if he might have a faint sprinkling of good  blood in his veins. Indeed, I have thought it possible that his  great-grandfather was a bulldog. But he always barks at _me_, which I  consider as proof positive that he is nothing but a low-born mongrel.  To be sure, his master says, to excuse him, that he never saw a woman  before; but a dog of any chivalry would have recognized the gentler  sex, even if it _was_ the first time that he had been blessed with the  sight.    In the first part of my letter I alluded to the swearing propensities  of the Rich Barians. Those, of course, would shock you; but, though you  hate slang, I know that you could not help smiling at some of their  bizarre cant phrases.    For instance, if you tell a Rich Barian anything which he doubts,  instead of simply asking you if it is true, he will _invariably_ cock  his head interrogatively, and almost pathetically address you with the  solemn adjuration, \"Honest Indian?\" Whether this phrase is a slur or a  compliment to the aborigines of this country, I do not know.    Again, they will agree to a proposal with the appropriate words, \"Talk  enough when horses fight!\" which sentence they will sometimes slightly  vary to \"Talk enough between gentlemen.\"    If they wish to borrow anything of you, they will mildly inquire if you  have it \"about your clothes.\" As an illustration: a man asked F., the  other day, if he had a spare pickax about his clothes. And F. himself  gravely inquired of me this evening, at the dinner-table, if I had a  _pickle_ about my clothes.    If they ask a man an embarrassing question, or in any way have placed  him in an equivocal position, they will triumphantly declare that they  have \"got the dead-wood on him.\" And they are everlastingly \"going nary  cent\" on those of whose credit they are doubtful. There are many  others, which may be common enough everywhere, but as I never happened  to hear them before, they have for me all the freshness of originality.  You know that it has always been one of my pet rages to trace cant  phrases to their origin; but most of those in vogue here would, I  verily believe, puzzle Horne Tooke himself.

You will perchance be surprised, dear M., to receive a letter from me  dated Indian instead of Rich Bar, but, as many of F.'s most intimate  friends reside at this settlement, he concluded to build his log cabin  here.    Solemn council was held upon the ways and means of getting \"Dame  Shirley\" to her new home. The general opinion was, that she had better  mount her fat mule and ride over the hill, as all agreed that it was  very doubtful whether she would be able to cross the logs and jump the  rocks which would bar her way by the water-passage. But that obstinate  little personage, who has always been haunted with a passionate desire  to do everything which people said she could _not_ do, made up her  willful mind immediately to go by the river. Behold, then, the \"Dame\"  on her winding way, escorted by a deputation of Indian Barians, which  had come up for that important purpose.    It is impossible, my sister, for any power of language, over which _I_  have command, to convey to you an idea of the wild grandeur and the  awful magnificence of the scenery in this vicinity. This fork of the  Feather River comes down very much as the water does at Lodore, now  gliding along with a liquid measure like a river in a dream, and anon  bursting into a thousand glittering foam-beads over the huge rocks,  which rise dark, solemn, and weird-like in its midst. The crossings are  formed of logs, often moss-grown. Only think how charmingly picturesque  to eyes wearied with the costly masonry or carpentry of the bridges at  home! At every step gold-diggers, or their operations, greet your  vision, sometimes in the form of a dam, sometimes in that of a river  turned slightly from its channel to aid the indefatigable gold-hunters  in their mining projects. Now, on the side of a hill, you will see a  long-tom, a huge machine invented to facilitate the separation of the  ore from its native element; or a man busily engaged in working a  rocker, a much smaller and simpler machine used for the same object;  or, more primitive still, some solitary prospector with a pan of dirt  in his hands, which he is carefully washing at the water's edge to see  if he can \"get the color,\" as it is technically phrased, which means,  literally, the smallest particle of gold.    As we approached Indian Bar the path led several times fearfully near  deep holes, from which the laborers were gathering their yellow  harvest, and Dame Shirley's small head swam dizzily as she crept  shudderingly by.    The first thing which attracted my attention as my new home came in  view, was the blended blue, red, and white of the American banner  undulating like a many-colored snake amid the lofty verdure of the  cedars which garland the brown brow of the hill behind our cabin. This  flag was suspended on the Fourth of July last by a patriotic sailor,  who climbed to the top of the tree to which he attached it, cutting  away the branches as he descended, until it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23286"],[0,"The Rover Boys Under Canvas; Or, The Mystery of the Wrecked Submarine (#18)"],[1,"word from  Clearwater Hall that Martha and Mary were also coming through finely.    \"And what about Ruth and May?\" questioned Jack, who was on the 'phone,  with Fred beside him.    \"Ruth is at the head of the class,\" announced Martha, over the  telephone. \"May will stand third or fourth.\"    \"Then give them both our congratulations,\" said Jack.    \"And also our best regards,\" added Fred, crowding his cousin to one  side.    \"Hold the wire a minute and you can talk to them yourselves,\" said  Martha. And a minute later Jack was talking to Ruth and later still  Fred managed to get in a few words with May.    Following the examinations, Colonel Colby called the entire school  together, and then announced that he was going to take his departure  for Camp Huxwell and would leave the scholars in charge of Captain  Dale and Professors Grawson and Brice.    \"I am sorry to leave you,\" announced the colonel, \"but I have accepted  the call of our country and shall go to the training camp without  further delay. But you all know Captain Dale very well, and I feel  sure that you will be glad to learn that he will have charge during  the annual encampment. He will be assisted by the professors and some  others, and all arrangements have been perfected for making this  outing a great success.    \"With talk of war filling the air, we shall try to show what Colby  Hall can do in the way of first-class military training. Captain Dale  will see to it that you are given an opportunity to show what you can  do at target and bayonet practice, and in marching and other camp  activities. There will, of course, be the usual athletic contests, and  as you are going down to the coast, you will likewise have an  opportunity to make use of the water.\"    Here the colonel paused, and there was a faint handclapping, quickly  followed by a generous round of applause.    \"Evidently you all like the idea of going in camp near the water,\"  said Colonel Colby, smiling.    \"It's dandy!\" called out Andy, and at this there was a general laugh.    \"Before you depart for Camp Barlight, as the place will be called,  Captain Dale will hold the annual election of officers. As the old  cadets here know, no cadet who has not been at this school for at  least six months can hold any office in the battalion. Apart from that  rule, the cadets can make up their tickets to suit themselves. You  will first vote for a major, then for three captains, one each for  Companies A, B, and C, and then for two lieutenants for each company.  The other officers, including the quartermaster, will be selected by  Captain Dale and the professors.    \"And now, young gentlemen, I must bid you good-bye, and I trust that  you have a good time during the encampment. As I expect to be at Camp  Huxwell for some weeks at least, I shall probably have the opportunity  from time to time of coming over to see how you are getting along.\"    Colonel Colby bowed and stepped back, and again there was a round of  applause. In the midst of this Major Ralph Mason arose and walked to  the front.    \"Colonel Colby,\" he said in a loud voice, as soon as the applause had  subsided, \"in the name of the battalion which I have the honor to  command, I wish to thank you for all your kindness to us as students  here, and we trust you will accept our best wishes for good luck to  you in the course you are taking. We feel sure that with such men as  you in our army Uncle Sam is bound to help very materially in winning  this World War.    \"And now, sir, as a token of our esteem, and also as a reminder of  what we hope you will do to the enemy, allow me, sir, in the name of  all the cadets of Colby Hall, to present you with this.\"    As the young major concluded he drew from behind him a leather case  which he sprung open as he presented it to the astonished master of  the institution. There, in the case, rested a very fine automatic  pistol, its polished handle engraved with Colonel Colby's name and  also the fact that it was presented to him by the school, with the  date. The hat had been passed around among the boys for contributions  to this gift, and every cadet had given something.    Though the colonel was much astonished, he was likewise greatly  pleased at this evidence of their friendliness and interest in him,  and he accepted the gift in a few words which showed his emotion.    \"If I ever get to France this automatic shall go with me,\" he  announced. \"And you can rest assured that if ever the opportunity  comes, the weapon shall render a good account for itself.\" And  following these remarks there was another round of applause, and then  the school was dismissed.    Of course the boys had known about the annual election for a long  time, and there had been a good deal of wire-pulling over the question  of candidates for the various offices. It was felt by many, including  the Rovers, that Ralph Mason should remain the major of the school  battalion, because he was so well liked and was such a thoroughly good  officer. It was also felt that the captains of Company A and Company B  should remain, and likewise several of the lieutenants.    \"What we want most is a new captain for Company C,\" said Spouter.    \"Yes, and we want two lieutenants for that company, too,\" put in Walt  Baxter.    \"And the whole company wants to be jacked up,\" added Don Soppinger.  \"The way they have been drilling has been a disgrace to this school.  They don't do half as well as the other companies.\"    \"Well, you must remember one thing,\" said Jack. \"Company C was formed  long after they had Company A and Company B. That company always got  all the new fellows, and you can't expect new cadets to do as well as  the old ones.\"    \"Yes, but now that they are getting ready to form a Company D, the  fellows in Company C ought to be jacked up,\" said Fatty Hendry. \"They  need it.\"    \"Say, Fatty, do you want to become an officer of them?\" queried Randy  slyly.    \"Well, I wouldn't mind the job,\" answered the stout cadet. \"I think I  could boss 'em around a little better than Phil Huber did.\" Huber had  been the former captain, but he had left the school, and the command  was now in charge of the first lieutenant, a fellow named Gabe Werner.    Now it chanced that Lieutenant Werner was not very well liked at Colby  Hall. He was a tall, angular youth, with watery blue eyes and  straw-colored hair, and he had a general manner about him which was  anything but inviting. How he had ever gotten to be a lieutenant of  the cadets was a mystery.    \"I think they'll dump Lieutenant Werner,\" remarked Fred. \"I don't  believe anybody wants him for an officer again.\"    \"I guess you're right,\" answered Dan Soppinger. \"If anybody at all  voted for Werner, it would be Bill Glutts.\"    \"Well, Glutts isn't any better than Werner,\" was Jack's reply. \"He's a  regular blockhead, in my opinion.\"    Glutts was a youth who had come from the Middle West, and it was said  that his father was in the wholesale butcher business. He was a  broad-shouldered, beefy-looking youth, with prominent front teeth and  a face that was far from inviting.    \"Say, Jack, why don't you run for captain?\" queried Gif. \"I'm sure our  whole crowd would stand by you.\"    \"Oh, I don't know, Gif,\" returned Jack modestly. \"I didn't expect to  become an officer yet. Let some of the older cadets take hold. You  might run yourself.\"    \"No, I don't think I want the job,\" answered Gif.    \"Maybe you'd like it, Spouter?\" said Jack.    \"No, I'll give it up in your favor, Jack,\" was the prompt response.  Spouter looked at the assembled crowd. \"Say, fellows, what do you  think of it? Shall we put up Jack Rover for captain of Company C?\"    \"Sure!\"    \"Jack will be sure to run well!\"    So the comments ran on, and almost before he knew it, Jack had been  nominated by his friends for the position of captain of Company C.  Then began an animated discussion over the other offices to be filled,  and a little later Fred was nominated for a lieutenancy.          CHAPTER XV    THE ELECTION FOR OFFICERS      \"Jack, I hope you win out in that election,\" said Fred, after the  conference had come to an end and the cadets had dispersed.    \"I hope you win out, too, Fred,\" was the quick reply.    \"I think if anybody has a job to get elected, it will be you, Jack,\"  came from Randy. \"You can bet your bottom dollar that Gabe Werner will  make every effort to secure that office.\"    \"Well, as he is acting captain now, perhaps he deserves it,\" answered  Jack slowly.    \"He deserves nothing!\" came promptly from Andy. \"He's a regular bear.  He never has any consideration whatever for the cadets under him. Why,  only last week it made my blood boil the way he treated a couple of  new fellows. Of course, they didn't know what he wanted, but that's no  reason why he should howl at 'em the way he did. If he had done that  to me, I'd have thrown my gun at his head.\"    What had been said about Gabe Werner's ambition to become the regular  captain of Company C was true. The angular lieutenant was of the  opinion that the place belonged to him, and he did not hesitate to  tell this to all those with whom he was intimate.    Now that Slugger Brown and Nappy Martell had left Colby Hall for good,  Henry Stowell had established himself as a satellite of Werner, doing  all the mean little jobs the big cadet desired.    \"Of course you'll be elected,\" declared Codfish to the lieutenant,  when the talk over the coming election was rife. \"The place belongs to  you.\"    \"Sure it does,\" answered Gabe Werner readily. \"But I suppose I've got  to work like the rest of the candidates if I want it,\" he added,  heaving a deep sigh. Werner was lazy by nature, and he did not like  the idea of electioneering, any more than he did the idea of studying.    \"I'll tell you what you ought to do, Gabe,\" said Bill Glutts. \"You  ought to give the boys a spread, or treat them to an entertainment in  town. That would nail the captaincy for "]]]
