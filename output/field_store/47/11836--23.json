The introduction of Christianity  did not annihilate the older cults. The new religion incorporated some  of them; and although the rest were no longer regarded as sacred, the  feeling of obligation remained attached to them for centuries. They were  secularized, and ultimately degraded for the most part into burlesque.  Such as were connected with municipal life, or, as we shall see in a  future chapter, with family life, retained a measure of solemnity long  after it had passed away from rites which had been abandoned to an  unorganized mob. This is well illustrated by the contrast between the  ceremonial at Coventry (whatever its origin) and that at St. Briavels.  The stronger hand of a municipality would have a restraining power  wanting to that of a village community, or a parish--especially if the  latter had been governed by a lord, who in later times had been shorn of  his authority, or had ceased to reside among, or take an interest in the  affairs of, his tenantry. Something like this I take to have been the  history of St. Briavels. There does not appear from Rudder's account to  have been, in his time at least, any pageant commemorative of the  achievement of the lady to whom the parishioners reckoned themselves to  owe their privileges; nor have I been able to trace one by local  inquiries. But the tradition is at St. Briavels unmistakably connected  with a religious and social rite. The distribution of food on a day of  high and holy festival in the church to the congregation, and paid for  by a levy upon every householder in the parish, can point to nothing  else than a feast of the whole community as a solemn act of worship. Its  degeneracy in more recent times has been thus described to me by the  Rev. W. Taprell Allen:--\"For many years it was customary to bring to the  church on Whitsunday afternoon baskets of the stalest bread and hardest  cheese, cut up into small pieces the size of dice. Immediately after the  service the bread and cheese were scrambled for in the church, and it  was a custom to use them as pellets, the parson coming in for his share  as he left the pulpit. About 1857, or perhaps a year or two later, the  unseemly custom was transferred from the church to the churchyard, the  bread and cheese being thrown down from the church tower. Later on it  was transferred to the road outside the church gates. It now lasts but a  few minutes. A few years ago all the roughs of the Forest used to come  over, and there was much drinking and fighting; but now it is very  different. The custom has in fact been dying out.\" From these later  stages of decay the Godiva pageant was saved by becoming a municipal  festival. And while at St. Briavels we can watch the progress of  degeneration from a point at which the religious character of the  ceremony had not quite vanished, down to the most unblushing burlesque,  and to its ultimate expulsion from consecrated precincts,--at Coventry  we see but one phase, one moment, at which the rite, if it ever had any  title to that name, seems to have been photographed and rendered  permanent.    It is obvious, however, that a feast is not a dramatic representation of  a ride; and the point requiring elucidation is the intimate relation of  the feast at St. Briavels with a story apparently so irrelevant as that  of the countess' ride. To explain this, we must suppose that the feast  was only part--doubtless the concluding part--of a ceremony, and that  the former portion was a procession, of which the central figure was  identical with that familiar to us at Coventry. But such a procession,  terminating in a sacred feast, would have had no meaning if the naked  lady represented a creature merely of flesh and blood. It is only  explicable on the hypothesis that she was the goddess of a heathen cult,  such as Hertha (or Nerthus), whose periodical progress among her subject  tribes is described in a well-known passage by Tacitus,[57] and yet  survives, as we have seen, in the folklore of Ruegen. Now the historian  tells us that Hertha was Mother Earth, the goddess of the soil, whose  yearly celebration would appropriately take place in the spring or early  summer. To her the produce of the land would be ascribed; and in her  name and by her permission would all agricultural operations be  performed. Such a goddess it must be who is honoured by the ceremonies  already noticed in India. Such a goddess, at any rate, was the Bona Dea;  and to such a goddess we may readily believe would be ascribed the  privilege of cutting wood. It is quite consistent with this that the  payment by every household at St. Briavels should be made to the warden  of the forest, and that it should be spent by him on the goddess'  festival. We are left to surmise what were the tolls and burdens at  Coventry, so vaguely referred to by Roger of Wendover. Pigs and horses,  we learn from two different sources, were not included in the exemptions  obtained by the countess; and the reason for this in the latter case is  accounted for by the incident of Peeping Tom.    One other point is worthy of mention: both at St. Briavels and at  Coventry the commemoration takes place nearly at the same time of year.  The Great Fair at Coventry opens on the day after Corpus Christi  Day--that is to say, the Friday after Trinity Sunday. Corpus Christi Day  itself was the day on which the celebrated Coventry Miracle Plays were  performed; and the Fair opened the next morning. At the same time of  year too--namely, on Ascension Day--a custom, for which there is no  explanation in any record, was observed at St. Michael's Church, York,  when ale and bread and cheese were yearly given away in the church to  the poor of the parish.[58] Although Ascension Day is separated by three  weeks from Corpus Christi, the movable character of the feasts would  bridge this gulf without any difficulty; and heathen observances of the  same nature, and referring to the same season, when they had to be  reconciled to the Christian calendar, might easily find places in some  instances on one day and in others on another day. Godgifu and her  husband were honoured as founders of the Benedictine monastery at  Coventry, which rose upon the ruins of an earlier house of Benedictine  nuns founded by Osburg, a lady of the royal house, nearly two hundred  years before. This nunnery had been destroyed in the Danish wars about  the year 1016. Consequently, if any legend, or ceremony, was known or  practised at Coventry in connection with some traditional patroness, the  name of Godgifu was ready to hand to be identified with it. Through the  monastery Coventry first rose to wealth and repute; and the townsfolk on  this score owed a debt of gratitude to the foundress, though there is no  record whether any special day was set apart in her honour.    On the whole, then, there is ground for supposing that the legend and  procession of Lady Godiva are survivals of a pagan belief and worship  located at Coventry; that the legend was concerned with a being awful  and mysterious as Dame Berchta, or Hertha herself; and that the incident  of Peeping Tom was from the first, or at all events from an early date,  part of the story. The evidence upon which these conclusions rest may be  shortly recapitulated thus:--    1. The absence of historical foundation for the tradition.    2. The close resemblance between the tradition and other stories and  superstitions which unquestionably deal with heathen goddesses, such as  Berchta and Hertha.    3. The equally close analogy between the procession and that described  in Eastern stories, which, so far as we know, could not have reached  England at the latest period when the procession could possibly have  been instituted; and between the procession and certain heathen rites  practised not only in the East, but as near home as Rome and  Germany,--nay, in Britain itself.    4. The occurrence of a similar procession at Southam, in the same  county, having the special feature of a black lady, best explained as a  survival of certain rites practised by the ancient Britons.    5. The connection between the analogous legend at St. Briavel's and the  remains of a sacred communal feast that can hardly be anything else than  the degraded remnant of a pagan observance.    The want of historical evidence cannot, of course, be overlooked; but we  must remember that in investigating traditions and traditional  observances we are dealing with a phase of civilization of which history  only yields rare and indirect glimpses. It is the absence of direct  evidence that, not only in the science of Folklore, but also in the  physical sciences, causes resort to the evidence afforded by comparison  of other structures and processes. On the validity of this evidence, and  the reasoning based upon it, nearly all our scientific learning depends.  In spite, therefore, of the defects in the historical evidence, and in  the absence of evidence to the contrary, it can scarcely be denied that  the analogies in both custom and legend here brought together amount to  a fairly strong presumption in favour of the conclusions I have ventured  to draw from them.    If I may formulate my conjecture as to the course of development  actually pursued, it would be something like this. The ceremony at  Coventry is a survival of an annual rite in honour of a heathen goddess,  from which men were excluded. This rite, like all such, would have been  a part of the tribal cult, and intimately associated with the tribal  life and organization. Side by side with it a myth would have been  evolved, accounting for the performance as a dramatic representation of  an event in the goddess' career. This myth would have been similar in  outline to those recited above, and would have comprised an explanation  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24616"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Southwark Cathedral (#18)"],[1,"money (L100,000),  paid by the City and South London Electric Railway Company for  undermining the City Church of St. Mary Woolnoth in order to build a  station. This sum of L25,000 is specially destined for church  extension, and Dr. Talbot set apart L2,000 of it, directly it was  granted, for that purpose in the Woolwich area.    Mr. Harry Lloyd, of Woodlands, Caterham, is acting as Hon. Treasurer  to the fund which has been opened for the complete equipment of the  diocese.    The Cathedral Church of St. Saviour is as yet without endowment, and  depends entirely upon voluntary offerings for its expenses. These were  estimated on the average at about L2,500 till last year, when the cost  of maintenance amounted to L3,096, besides which about L350 was  required for the College of Clergy. Attention was called to this  matter by the Ven. Archdeacon Taylor during his Visitation held in the  Cathedral on 25th May, 1905, when he made an earnest appeal to the  church people of the diocese for their help and sympathy on behalf of  the Cathedral, the Bishop and his Suffragans, and all concerned in the  work.    The duties before them, in the arrangement and control of the various  elements of which the diocese is composed, will obviously not be  light, but ought to be extremely interesting and rewarding. They will  have to deal with extremes, which may there be said to meet, in a  combination of rural and urban, ancient and modern, commercial,  industrial, and aristocratic life, a variety in unity such as the  Catholic Church itself presents, of which the diocese may be regarded  as a miniature.                        \"In veste varietas sit: scissura non sit.\"       [Illustration: THE PRIORY SEAL.

II    THE PRIORY SEAL      The impressions given (p. 103) are taken from a fine, but imperfect,  sulphur cast in the British Museum (4050 lxxii, 66 and 67) of the Seal  in use in the twelfth century. It is circular, about 2-3/8 inches in  diameter, and contains, within a vesical compartment, a figure of the  Blessed Virgin, seated on a carved throne, holding a fleur-de-lis in  her right hand, and supporting with her left the Infant Saviour upon  her knee. The Holy Child is distinguished by a cruciform nimbus, while  that of the Virgin is a plain circle. The Child is raising the right  hand in benediction, and holds in the left an orb. The vesica is  bordered with a double dotted line, containing the salutation: \"Ave:  Maria: gracia: plena: Dns: tecum: benedicta.\" A similar border,  immediately within the circumference, holds the legend: \"Sigillum  ecclesie sancte Marie de Suthewercha.\"    The space between the circumference and the vesica is occupied on each  side by two angels, with expanded wings, those above issuing from  waves, those below kneeling.    The reverse contains a small counterseal, 1-3/8 inch in diameter. The  figure is an angel, with nimbus and expanded wings, issuing from  waves, with (probably) an orb in the hands.    The inscription: \"Ave: Mater: Misericordie.\"    It may be mentioned that the design of the seal varied with different  Priors. The British Museum possesses several casts, and an original in  red wax (attached to a deed), the design on which is indistinguishable.  The specimen chosen appears to be the most interesting and elaborate,  though not the most ancient, of those in the collection.          III    LIST OF THE CHAPLAINS OF ST.

It was the rule for two Chaplains to be in office at once till 1881,  when Dr. Thompson was made sole Chaplain. In 1885 he was appointed  Rector, and in 1897 Canon and Chancellor of the Collegiate Church.    The Rev. Mr. Kelle was dismissed in January, 1564, for refusing to  wear a surplice at the Communion; but in consideration of his old age  he was presented with the sum of L4, \"by the good wyllys\" of the  Vestry and Churchwardens.    Messrs. Holyland and Harman were then elected, as of a more compliant  temper, their \"wages\" being fixed at L20 a year \"and not the  christenings, and to leave at a fortnight's warning.\" Mrs. Holyland  was to receive \"for her wages\" ten shillings.    By far the most prominent in the list is Dr. Sacheverell. The two  sermons which led to his impeachment were preached at the Derby  Assizes on 15th August, and at St. Paul's Cathedral on 5th November,  1709. These, with his published Answer and the Speech in his Defence,  delivered at Westminster Hall on the 7th March, 1710, are still  exciting reading.          IV    VESTMENTS, PLATE, AND ORNAMENTS AT ST. SAVIOUR'S[33]      An examination was made on the 20th October, 1552, by the agents  \"assigned and appointed by the Commissioners, and by them sworn truly  to enquire and find out the whole of all such plate, jewels, and  ornaments, as since the beginning of the King's reign that now is  belonged to the Church of Saint Saviour in Southwark, as far as in  them lieth.\"    The duty of the agents involved a comparison of the goods which they  actually found in the church with the existing inventories, the most  important of which was the inventory made on 26th February, 1548, by  the retiring Wardens, and handed to their successors in office with  the property transferred to their care at the same time. The contents  of this inventory are as follows; the entries, however, have been  shortened and the spelling modernised:      Two principal copes of blue tissue \"with priest, deacon, and      sub-deacon, with all their apparel.\"[34]      Three other principal copes of the same material with _ut supra_.
