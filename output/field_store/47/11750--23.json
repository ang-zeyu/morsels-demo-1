The two monoliths are almost identical in size and workmanship, and  are inscribed with the same cartouches of Rameses the Great. The one  which I discovered was set up, in 1887, to the memory of our brave  soldiers who fell at the battle of Dogali. The site selected for the  monument, the square between the railway station and the Baths of  Diocletian, is too large for such a comparatively small shaft.    Two days later, on the 19th, we discovered two _kynokephaloi_ or  _kerkopithekoi_, five feet high, carved in black porphyry. The  monsters are sitting on their hind legs, with the paws of the forearms  resting on the knees. Their bases contain finely-cut hieroglyphics,  with the cartouche of King Necthor-heb, of the thirtieth Sebennitic  dynasty. One of these _kynokephaloi_, and also the obelisk, were  certainly seen in 1719 by the masons who built the foundations of the  Biblioteca Casanatense. For some reason unknown to us, they kept their  discovery a secret. Many other works of art were discovered before the  close of the excavations, in the last days of June. Among them were a  crocodile in red granite, the pedestal of a candelabrum, triangular in  shape, with sphinxes at the corners; a column of the temple, with  reliefs representing an Isiac procession; and a portion of a capital.  From an architectural point of view, the most curious discovery was  that the temple itself, with its colonnades and double cella, had been  brought over, piece by piece, from the banks of the Nile to those of  the Tiber. It is not an imitation; it is a purely original Egyptian  structure, shaded first by the palm-trees of Sais, and later by the  pines of the Campus Martius.    The earliest trustworthy account we have of its existence is given by  Flavius Josephus. He relates how Tiberius, after the assault of Mundus  against Paulina,[53] condemned the priests to crucifixion, burned the  shrine, and threw the statue of the goddess into the Tiber. Nero  restored the sanctuary; it was, however, destroyed again in the great  conflagration, A. D. 80. Domitian was the second restorer; Hadrian,  Commodus, Caracalla, and Alexander Severus improved and beautified the  group, from time to time. At the beginning of the fourth century of  our era it contained the _propylaia_, or pyramidal towers with a  gateway, at each end of the _dromos_; one near the present church of  S. Stefano del Cacco, one near the church of S. Macuto. They were  flanked by one or more pairs of obelisks, of which six have been  recovered up to the present time, namely, one now in the Piazza della  Rotonda, a second in the Piazza della Minerva, a third in the Villa  Mattei, a fourth in the Piazza della Stazione, a fifth in the  Sphaeristerion at Urbino, and fragments of a sixth in the Albani  collection.    From the propylaia, a _dromos_, or sacred avenue, led to the double  temple. To the dromos belong the two lions in the Museo Etrusco  Gregoriano, the two lions in the Capitoline Museum, the sphinx of  Queen Hathsepu in the Barracco collection, the sphinx of Amasis and  the Tranquilli sphinx in the Capitol, the cow Hathor and the statue of  Uahabra in the Museo Archeologico in Florence, the _kynokephaloi_ of  Necthor-heb, the _kynokephalos_ which gave the popular name of _Cacco_  (ape) to the church of S. Stefano, the statue formerly in the Ludovisi  Gallery, the Nile of the Braccio Nuovo, the Tiber of the Louvre, the  Oceanus at Naples, the River-God buried in 1440, the Isiac altars of  the Capitol and of the Louvre, the tripod, the crocodile and sundry  other fragments which were found in 1883. Of the temple itself we  possess two columns covered with mystic bas-reliefs, seven  capitals,--one in the Capitol, the others in the Vatican,--and two  blocks of granite from the walls of the cella, one in the Barberini  gardens, one in the Palazzo Galitzin.    The last historical mention we possess of this admirable Egyptian  museum of ancient Rome was found by Delille in the \"Cod. Parisin.\"  8064, in which the attempt by Nicomachus Flavianus to revive the pagan  religion in 394 A. D. is minutely described.[54] The reaction caused  by this final outburst of fanaticism must have been fatal to the  temple. The masterpieces of the dromos were upset, and otherwise  damaged, the faces of the _kynokephaloi_ and the noses and paws of the  sphinxes were knocked off, and statues of Pharaohs, gods, priests,  dignitaries, and Pastophoroi were hurled from their pedestals, and  broken to pieces. When this wholesale destruction took place, the  pavement of the temple was still clear of the rubbish and loose soil.  The sphinx of Amasis, found June 14, was lying on its left side on the  bare pavement; the two apes had fallen on their backs. No attempt,  however, was made to overthrow the obelisks, at least the one which I  discovered. When the monolith fell, in the eighth or ninth century,  the floor of the Iseum was already covered with a bed of rubbish five  feet thick. To this fact we owe the wonderful preservation of the  obelisk, the soft, muddy condition of the soil having eased the weight  of the fall.    Students have wondered at the existence, in our time, of such a mine  of antiquities in this quarter of the Campus Martius, where it appears  as if, in spite of the feverish search for ancient marbles, this spot  had escaped the attention of the excavators of the past four or five  centuries. It did not escape their attention. The whole area of the  Iseum, save a few recesses, has been explored since the Middle Ages,  but the search was made to secure marble, which could be burnt into  lime, or turned into new shapes. Of what use would porphyry, or  granite, or basalt be for such purposes? These materials are useless  for the lime-kiln, and too hard to be worked anew, and accordingly  they were left alone. In the excavations of 1883 I found the best  evidence that such was the case. The obelisk is of granite; its  pedestal of white marble. The obelisk escaped destruction, but the  pedestal was split, and made ready for the lime-kiln.      THE TEMPLE OF NEPTUNE. The discoveries made in 1878 in the Piazza di  Pietra, on the site of the Temple of Neptune, rank next in importance  to those just described. In repairing a drain which runs through the  Via de' Bergamaschi to the Piazza di Pietra, the foundations of an  early mediaeval church, dedicated to S. Stephen (Santo Stefano del  Trullo) were unearthed, together with historical inscriptions, pieces  of columns of _giallo antico_, and other architectural fragments. On a  closer examination of the discoveries, I was able to ascertain that  the whole church had been built with spoils from the triumphal arch of  Claudius in the Piazza di Sciarra, and from the Temple of Neptune in  the Piazza di Pietra. To enable the reader to appreciate the value of  the discovery, I must begin with a short description of the temple  itself.    Dio Cassius (liii. 27) states that, in 26 B. C., Marcus Agrippa built  the Portico of the Argonauts, with a temple in the middle of it,  called the Poseidonion ([Greek: POSEIDONION]), in token of his  gratitude to the god of the seas for the naval victories he had gained  over the foes of the commonwealth; but the beautiful ruins still  existing in the Piazza di Pietra do not belong to Agrippa's work, nor  to the golden age of Roman art. They belong to the restoration of the  temple which was made by Hadrian after the great fire of A. D. 80, by  which the Neptunium, or Poseidonion, was nearly destroyed. The  characteristic feature of the temple was a set of thirty-six  bas-reliefs representing the thirty-six provinces of the Roman Empire  at the beginning of the Christian era. These reliefs were set into the  basement of the temple, so as to form the pedestals of the thirty-six  columns of the peristyle, while the intercolumniations, or spaces  between the pedestals, were occupied by another set of bas-reliefs  representing the military uniforms, flags and weapons which were  peculiar to each of the provinces. The fifteen provinces and fourteen  trophies belonging to the colonnade of the Piazza di Pietra, that is,  to the north side of the temple, have all been accounted for. Four  provinces were found during the pontificate of Paul III. (1534-50),  two during that of Innocent X. (1644-55), two during that of Alexander  VII. (1655-1667), three in our excavations of 1878, and four either  are still in the ground or have perished in a lime-kiln. Here again we  have an instance of the shameful dispersion of the spoils of ancient  Rome. We have this wing of the temple still standing in all its glory,  in the Piazza di Pietra; we have eleven pedestals out of fifteen, and  as many panels for the intercolumniations; the others are _probably_  within our reach, and we have beautiful pieces of the entablature with  its rich carvings. The temple, entablature, and nearly all the  trophies and provinces are public property; nothing would be easier  than to restore each piece to its proper place, and make this wing of  the Neptunium one of the most perfect relics of ancient Rome. Alas!  three provinces and two trophies have emigrated to Naples with the  rest of the Farnese marbles, one has been left behind in the portico  of the Farnese palace in Rome, five provinces and four trophies are in  the Palazzo dei Conservatori, two are in the Palazzo Odescalchi, one  is in the Palazzo Altieri, two pieces of the entablature are used as  a rustic seat in the Giardino delle Tre Pile on the Capitol, and  another has been used in the restoration of the Arch of Constantine.

If he  don't look out he'll get stuck there and never get out.\"    \"Do you know the swamp?\" asked Dick. \"I mean the good spots?\"    \"Fairly well--I used to come over here when I was a boy--to pick  huckleberries. They are plentiful on the other side of the swamp.\"    \"Then supposing you lead the way and we'll follow.\"    They were soon in the woods and saw a well-defined path running to the  eastward. Beyond was Nixon's Swamp, and still further on another woods.    They were afraid they had lost track of the man they were after when  they heard a crack ahead of them, followed by a short yell of alarm.  Merrick had stumbled over a fallen log and pitched headlong into some  thorny bushes. It took him some time to extricate himself, and meanwhile  the pursuers drew closer.    \"I see him!\" cried Tom. \"He is turning to the right!\"    \"He is headed for the worst part of the swamp,\" was Mr. Laning's  comment. \"If he doesn't look out----\"    A minute later a wild cry rang out from ahead. The cry was repeated  twice, and then all became as silent as the grave.    \"He must have gone down into the swamp,\" exclaimed Dick.    \"Yes, and more than likely he is drowning to death,\" added John Laning.          CHAPTER XX    DICK AND DORA      The boys were almost afraid to penetrate further into the woods, for  they found the ground growing wet and spongy under their feet. All  halted and gathered around Mr. Laning.    \"Do you think he has really been drowned?\" asked Sam, with a slight  shiver.    \"It may be,\" was the farmer's reply. \"I know of one man who was drowned  here some years ago, and every year cattle are lost here. The bottom of  the swamp is very sticky, and once a person gets in he sinks down and  under.\"    \"What shall we do?\" questioned Tom.    \"We can go ahead, but we want to be mighty careful. Don't take a step  until you are sure of your footing. If you find yourself sinking, grab  hold of some tree or bush.\"    Mr. Laning led the way and the boys followed, until they had covered a  distance of fifty or sixty feet. Here the ground was so soft they had to  leap from one tree root or clump of bushes to another. As they moved  forward they listened intently for some further sound from Merrick, but  none came.    \"Hullo, what's this?\" cried Dick, presently, and moved to one side,  close to a pool of dark and treacherous-looking water. \"A man's hat!\"    He picked it up and turned it over. On the inside were the initials, S.  A. M.    \"It must be Merrick's,\" he went on. \"Can he have gone down here?\"    The others came at his call and all looked at the hat, which had been  lying in the mud at the side of the pool. Then a match was struck, and  all gazed around and into the pool while this faint illumination lasted.  No other trace of the missing man was to be seen.    \"Merrick, where are you?\" called out Dick. \"If you need help, say so,  and we'll try to get you out.\"    \"Do you think he'd answer that call?\" asked Fred.    \"I think he'd rather go to prison than die in this swamp,\" was the  reply.    The students and Mr. Laning moved cautiously around the edge of the  swamp for half an hour and then returned to the roadway. To mark the  spot where the hat had been found Dick hung the head covering on a tree  limb.    \"We can come back in the daylight and make another search,\" said he.  \"And we can notify the authorities, too.\"    When they got back to the Stanhope cottage they found the others  anxiously awaiting their return.    \"Did you catch him?\"    \"Did he hurt you?\"    \"No, we didn't catch him, and nobody is hurt,\" answered Mr. Laning. \"We  lost him in the swamp, and there is no telling where he is now.\"    \"I want to get hold of him for two reasons--that is, if he is alive,\"  said Dick. \"I want to get back those bonds and I want to know what  brought him to this cottage.\"    \"Maybe he came here to rob the Stanhopes,\" whispered Tom. \"But I  shouldn't tell them, for it will frighten them too much.\"    \"No, don't say a word, Tom. If you do, Mrs. Stanhope will be just as  nervous as she ever was.\"    \"I and my family are going to stay here to-night,\" announced Mr. Laning;  \"so we can go on a hunt for that man first thing in the morning.\"    \"And I'll drive over, if Captain Putnam will let me,\" answered Dick.    The appearance of Merrick had put a damper on the breaking up of the  party, and the Rovers were rather silent as they went back to the  school. It was too late to speak to Captain Putnam that night, but Dick  was up early and saw the master of the Hall before breakfast.    \"I trust you had a good time last night,\" said Captain Putnam, smiling.    \"We did have, sir,\" said Dick. \"But our party broke up in a way we  didn't anticipate,\" and then he told of what had occurred.    The captain had heard of the missing traction company bonds, and he  readily allowed Dick to go back to the cottage, using a horse and buggy  for that purpose. Sam and Tom wanted to go, too, but to this Captain  Putnam demurred.    \"I think one is enough, especially as Mr. Laning is there, too,\" he  said.    With a good horse and a light buggy, it did not take long for the eldest  Rover boy to reach the Stanhope cottage. The family had just had  breakfast and were surprised to see him so early.    \"Didn't you have anything to eat?\" questioned Dora. \"If you didn't, come  right in, and I'll make you an omelet and some coffee.\"    \"No, thank you, Dora,\" he whispered. \"I'll have to wait for that until  we're keeping house together. Then----\"    \"Oh, Dick!\" she cried and blushed like a rose.    \"I had breakfast while driving over,--an orange and some sandwiches,\"  went on the youth. \"Mrs. Green got them ready for me. Is there anything  new?\"    \"No. Uncle John is waiting for you. He is in the woodshed, trying on  some old rubber boots. He says one ought to have rubber boots to go into  the swamp with.\"    Dick hurried to the woodshed and there found that Mr. Laning had  unearthed two pairs of boots, and he donned one pair while the farmer  put on the other. A little later both got in the buggy and drove up the  road they had traveled the night previous. Then they tied the horse to a  tree, and followed the path leading to the edge of the swamp.    \"Hullo, the hat is gone!\" exclaimed Dick, as he came close to the black  pool.    \"Maybe it dropped to the ground,\" suggested John Laning.    Both looked around, but could see nothing of the missing head covering.  Then Dick caught sight of a slip of paper pinned to the tree.    \"Here is a message of some kind,\" he said, and read it. The message ran  as follows:         \"I reckon I fooled you this trip. I was up in the tree all the       time. By the time you get this I shall be miles away. Ta ta until       the next time.\"    \"Humph!\" muttered Dick. \"What do you think of that?\" And he passed the  message to his companion.    \"He certainly fooled us,\" answered Mr. Laning. \"I suppose those yells  were only to put us off our guard. It's a pity we didn't carry his hat  off for a souvenir of the occasion--as you youngsters put it.\" And the  farmer grinned.    \"Perhaps he is still around,\" suggested Dick. \"If he tried to fool us  once he might try to fool us again.\"    \"That's so, too. It won't do any harm to take a good look around while  we are at it, Dick.\"    They spent the whole of the morning walking around the swamp and in  trying to trace the movements of Merrick, but without success. Nothing  concerning the rascal was to be found, and when they felt both tired out  and hungry they returned to the Stanhope cottage. Here the girls and the  ladies had a hot dinner awaiting them and served them liberally,  finishing up with apple pie that Dora had made for Dick's especial  benefit.    \"It's fine!\" he said to her, on the sly.    \"Then you like it?\" she answered, with a smile.    \"Do I? Dora, when we're keeping house you shall make me a pie like this  twice a week,\" he added, earnestly.    \"Dick, if you don't stop your joking----\"    \"Oh, I'm not joking, Dora. Of course, if you're not willing to make me a  pie now and then----\"    \"Oh, it isn't that--I'll make all the pies you want. But--but----\" And  then Dora blushed so furiously that she had to run from the room. Dick  looked after her longingly and heaved a mountainous sigh. He wished that  all his academy days were over and that he was engaged in business and  settled down in life. He knew just what kind of a home he wanted, and  who he wanted in it besides himself--and perhaps Dora knew, too.    \"But I can't think of those things yet,\" he mused, as he finished his  dinner. \"I've got to go out into the world first, get into business, and  prove my worth.\"    The meal over, it was decided that Dick and Mr. Laning should drive to  Cedarville and get into communication with the local authorities and  also the authorities at Ithaca. This was done, and the following day  another hunt was made for Merrick. But he could not be found; and there,  for the time being, the affair rested.    \"I think we'll hear from him again some day,\" said Dick, and he was  right; they did hear from the swindler, and when they least expected it.          CHAPTER XXI    A BOB SLED RACE      \"Whoop! hurrah! it's snowing!\"    Thus shouted Tom one day, as he burst into the library of the Hall,  where Dick, Sam and a number of others were perusing books and the  latest magazines.    \"Hard?\" queried Sam, dropping the magazine he held.    \"No, but steady. Peleg Snuggers says it is going to be a heavy fall, and  he generally knows.\"    \"And he loves snowstorms so,\" put in Fred, with a laugh. \"Do you  remember the time we made a big fort and had a regular battle?\"    \"Indeed I do!\" cried Larry. \"It was great! We ought to have something of  that sort this winter.\"    \"I was hoping we'd get skating before it snowed,\" put in Songbird.    \"Well, we can't have all the good things at once,\" answered Dick. \"I  think a"]]]
