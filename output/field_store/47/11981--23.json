The expression  of his countenance was extremely pleasing.[144] ...    \"If report speaks truly, the number of the princesses and concubines  amounts to seven hundred.\"    Abdur Razzak gives a glowing account of the brilliancy of a great  festival of which he was a spectator while in the capital. He calls it  the Mahanavami[145] festival, but I have my doubts as to whether he  was not mistaken, since he declares that it took place in the month  Rajab (October 25 to November 23, 1443 A.D.). The Hindus celebrate  the MAHANAVAMI by a nine days' festival beginning on Asvina Sukla  1st in native reckoning, that is, on the day following the new moon  which marks the beginning of the month Asvina; while the New Year's  Day at that period was the first day of the following month, Karttika  (if the year began, as it certainly did at Vijayanagar in the time of  Paes, eighty years later, on 1st Karttika). But the new moon of Rajab  in A.D. 1443 corresponded to the new moon of KARTTIKA, not to that  of ASVINA.[146] Either, therefore, the festival which he witnessed  was the New Year's Day festival, or the traveller was in error in  giving the month \"Rajab.\" It seems most probable that the former  was the case, because he apparently makes the festival one of only  three days' duration, whereas the MAHANAVAMI, as its name implies,  was a nine days' feast. But there is also another difficulty. The  MAHANAVAMI celebrations began with the new moon, whereas Razzak says  that the festival he saw began with the \"full moon.\" This, however,  may have been due to a slip of the pen.    However that may be, he certainly was a spectator of a brilliant scene,  and I append his account of it.    \"In pursuance of orders issued by the king of Bidjanagar, the  generals and principal personages from all parts of his empire  ... presented themselves at the palace. They brought with them a  thousand elephants ... which were covered with brilliant armour and  with castles magnificently adorned.... During three consecutive days  in the month of Redjeb the vast space of land magnificently decorated,  in which the enormous elephants were congregated together, presented  the appearance of the waves of the sea, or of that compact mass which  will be assembled together at the day of the resurrection. Over this  magnificent space were erected numerous pavilions, to the height of  three, four, or even five storeys, covered from top to bottom with  figures in relief.... Some of these pavilions were arranged in such a  manner that they could turn rapidly round and present a new face: at  each moment a new chamber or a new hall presented itself to the view.    \"In the front of this place rose a palace with nine pavilions  magnificently ornamented. In the ninth the king's throne was set  up. In the seventh was allotted a place to the humble author of this  narrative.... Between the palace and the pavilions ... were musicians  and storytellers.\"    Girls were there in magnificent dresses, dancing \"behind a pretty  curtain opposite the king.\" There were numberless performances given  by jugglers, who displayed elephants marvellously trained.    During three consecutive days, from sunrise to sunset,  the royal festival was prolonged in a style of the greatest  magnificence. Fireworks, games, and amusements went on. On the third  day the writer was presented to the king.    \"The throne, which was of extraordinary size, was made of gold,  and enriched with precious stones of extreme value.... Before the  throne was a square cushion, on the edges of which were sown three  rows of pearls. During the three days the king remained seated on  this cushion. When the fete of Mahanawi was ended, at the hour of  evening prayer, I was introduced into the middle of four ESTRADES,  which were about ten ghez both in length and breadth.[147] The roof  and the walls were entirely formed of plates of gold enriched with  precious stones. Each of these plates was as thick as the blade of a  sword, and was fastened with golden nails. Upon the ESTRADE, in the  front, is placed the throne of the king, and the throne itself is of  very great size.\"    The descriptions given by these travellers give us a good idea of  the splendours of this great Hindu capital in the first half of the  fifteenth century; and with this in our minds we return to the history  of the period.        CHAPTER 8    Close of the First Dynasty (A.D. 1449 to 1490)    Mallikarjuna and Virupaksha I. -- Rajasekhara and Virupaksha II. --  The Dakhan splits up into five independent kingdoms -- The Bijapur  king captures Goa and Belgaum -- Fighting at Rajahmundry, Kondapalle,  and other parts of Telingana -- Death of Mahmud Gawan -- The Russian  traveller Nikitin -- Chaos at Vijayanagar -- Narasimha seizes the  throne.    I have already stated that the period following the reign of Deva  Raya II. is one very difficult to fill up satisfactorily from any  source. It was a period of confusion in Vijayanagar -- a fact that  is clearly brought out by Nuniz in his chronicle.    A.D. 1449 is the last date in any known inscription containing mention  of a Deva Raya, and Dr. Hultzsch[148] allots this to Deva Raya II. It  may be, as already suggested, that there was a Deva Raya III. on the  throne between A.D. 1444 and 1449, but this remains to be proved. Two  sons of Deva Raya II., according to the inscriptions, were named  Mallikarjuna and Virupaksha I. respectively. There are inscriptions  of the former dated in A.D. 1452 -- 53 and 1464 -- 65,[149] and one  of the latter in 1470.[150] Mallikarjuna appears to have had two sons,  Rajasekhara, of whom we have inscriptions in the years A.D. 1479 -- 80  and 1486 -- 87, and Virupaksha II., mentioned in an inscription dated  A.D. 1483 -- 84, three years earlier than the last of Rajasekhara.    Dr. Hultzsch, in the third volume of the EPIGRAPHIA INDICA, p. 36,  gives these dates, but in the fourth volume of the same work (p. 180)  he notes that an inscription of Rajasekhara exists at Ambur in North  Arcot, which is dated in the year corresponding to A.D. 1468 --  69. I have also been told of an inscription on stone to be seen at  the village of Parnapalle (or Paranapalle) in the Cuddapah district,  of which a copy on copper-plate is said to be in the possession of one  Narayana Reddi of Goddamari in the Tadpatri Taluq of the Anantapur  district. This is reported to bear the date Saka 1398 (A.D. 1476 --  77), and to mention as sovereign \"Praudha Deva Raya of Vijayanagar.\"    Rajasekhara's second inscription must have been engraved very shortly  before the final fall of the old royal house, for the first certain  date of the usurper Narasimha is A.D. 1450.    Amid this confusion of overlapping dates we turn for help to  Nuniz; but though his story, gathered from tradition about the year  1535, is clear and consecutive, it clashes somewhat with the other  records. According to him, Deva Raya II. had a son, Pina Raya, who  died six months after his attempted assassination; but we have shown  that Abdur Razzak conclusively establishes that this unfortunate  monarch was Deva Raya II. himself, and that the crime was committed  before the month of April 1443. Pina Raya left a son unnamed, who  did nothing in particular, and was succeeded by his son \"Verupaca,\"  by which name Virupaksha is clearly meant. Virupaksha was murdered  by his eldest son, who in turn was slain by his younger brother,  \"Padea Rao,\" and this prince lost the kingdom to the usurper Narasimha.    The period was without doubt a troublous one, and all that can be  definitely and safely stated at present is that for about forty years  prior to the usurpation of Narasimha the kingdom passed from one hand  to the other, in the midst of much political agitation, discontent,  and widespread antagonism to the representatives of the old royal  family, several of whom appear to have met with violent deaths. The  usurpation took place at some period between A.D. 1487 and 1490.    Leaving the Hindu and Portuguese records, we must turn to the  Muhammadan historians in order to see what were the political relations  existing at this time between Vijayanagar and its hereditary enemies  to the north. Firishtah tells us of no event occurring between the  year 1443 and 1458 A.D. to disturb the peaceful conditions then  existing. Kulbarga was itself in too troubled a condition to venture  on further national complications. Internal disputes and civil war  raged in the Dakhan, and the country was divided against itself. The  trouble had begun which ended only with the extinction of the Bahmani  monarchy, and the establishment of five rival Muhammadan kingdoms in  the place of one.    Ala-ud-din died February 13, A.D. 1458, (?)[151] and was succeeded by  his son Humayun, a prince of \"cruel and sanguinary temper.\" In the  following year Humayun waged war against the country of the Telugus  and besieged Devarakonda, which made so stout a resistance that the  Dakhani armies were baffled, and retired. He died on the 5th September  1461,[152] to the great relief of all his subjects. Mallikarjuna  appears to have been then king of Vijayanagar.    Nizam Shah succeeded to the throne, being then only eight years old,  but his reign was of short duration. He was succeeded by his brother  Muhammad on July 30, A D. 1463,[153]    In the middle of the year 1469, while either Rajasekhara or Virupaksha  I. was the king of Vijayanagar, Mahmud Gawan, Muhammad's minister,  marched towards the west, and after a fairly successful campaign  attacked Goa, then in the possession of the Raya of Vijayanagar, both  by sea and land. He was completely victorious and captured the place.    The war was probably undertaken in revenge for a cruel massacre of  Muhammadans which took place in this Year A.D. 1469, according to  Barros.[154] At this period the coast trade was altogether in the hands  of the Muhammadans,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33129"],[0,"Incidents of Travel in Yucatan, Vol. I. (#18)"],[1,"be  improved. The first eye was cut quickly and successfully, and while the  bloody orb was rolling in its socket, the same operation was performed  upon the other. In this, however, fearing that the eye might be drawn  too far in the opposite direction, the doctor had not thought it  advisable to cut the muscle entirely through, and, on examining it, he  was not satisfied with the appearance. The general again laid his head  upon the pillow, and the operation was repeated, making three times in  rapid succession. Altogether, it was a trying thing, and I felt  immensely happy when it was over. With his eyes all right and both  bandaged, we carried him to a caleza in waiting, where, to the great  amusement of the vagabond boys, he took his seat on the footboard, with  his back to the horse, and it was some time before we could get him  right.    In the mean time the young lady had returned with her mother. She could  not bear to lose the opportunity, and though unable to make up her mind  to undergo the operation, she could not keep away. She was about  eighteen, of lively imagination, picturing pleasure or pain in the  strongest colours, and with a smile ever ready to chase away the tear.  At one moment she roused herself to the effort, and the next, calling  herself coward, fell into her mother's arms, while her mother cheered  and encouraged her, representing to her, with that confidence allowed  before medical men, the advantage it would give her in the eyes of our  sex. Her eyes were large, full, and round, and with the tear glistening  in them, the defect was hardly visible; in fact, all that they wanted  was to be made to roll in the right direction.    I have given the reader a faint picture of Daguerreotype practice with  young ladies, but this was altogether another thing, and it was very  different from having to deal with boys or men. It is easy enough to  spread out a boy upon a table, but not so with a young lady; so, too,  it is easy enough to tie a bandage around a boy's head, but vastly  different among combs and curls, and long hair done up behind. As the  principal assistant of Doctor Cabot, this complicated business devolved  upon me; and having, with the help of her mother, accomplished it, I  laid her head upon the pillow as carefully as if it had been my own  property. In all the previous cases I had found it necessary, in order  to steady my hand, to lean my elbow on the table, and my wrist on the  forehead of the patient I did the same with her, and, if I know myself  I never gazed into any eyes as I did into that young lady's one eye in  particular. When the doctor drew out the instrument, I certainly could  have taken her in my arms, but her imagination had been too powerful;  her eyes closed, a slight shudder seized her, and she fainted. That  passed off, and she rose with her eyes all right. A young gentleman was  in attendance to escort her to her home, and the smile had again  returned to her cheek as he told her that now her lover would not know  her.    This case had occupied a great deal of time; the doctor's labours were  doubled by the want of regular surgical aid, he was fatigued with the  excitement, and I was worn out; my head was actually swimming with  visions of bleeding and mutilated eyes, and I almost felt doubtful  about my own. The repetition of the operations had not accustomed me to  them; indeed, the last was more painful to me than the first, and I  felt willing to abandon forever the practice of surgery. Doctor Cabot  had explained the modus operandi fully to the medical gentlemen, had  offered to procure them instruments, and considering the thing fairly  introduced into the country, we determined to stop. But this was not so  easy; the crowd out of doors had their opinion on the subject; the  biscos considered that we were treating them outrageously, and became  as clamorous as a mob in a western city about to administer Lynch law.  One would not be kept back. He was a strapping youth, with cast enough  in his eye to carry everything before him, and had probably been  taunted all his life by merciless schoolboys. Forcing himself inside,  with his hands in his pockets, he said that he had the money to pay for  it, and would not be put off. We were obliged to apologize, and, with a  little wish to bring him down, gave him some hope that he should be  attended to on our return to Merida.    The news of these successes flew like wild-fire, and a great sensation  was created throughout the city. All the evening Doctor Cabot was  besieged with applications, and I could but think how fleeting is this  world's fame! At first my arrival in the country had been fairly  trumpeted in the newspapers; for a little while Mr. Catherwood had  thrown me in the shade with the Daguerreotype, and now all our glories  were swallowed up by Doctor Cabot's cure of strabismus. Nevertheless,  his fame was reflected upon us. All the afternoon squint-eyed boys were  passing up and down the street, throwing slanting glances in at the  door, and toward evening, as Mr. Catherwood and I were walking to the  plaza, we were hailed by some vagabond urchins with the obstreperous  shout, \"There go the men who cure the biscos.\"                                        CHAPTER VI.

On Thursday, the twelfth day of November, we rose for our departure  from Merida. The plan of our route, and all the arrangements for our  journey, were made by our friend Don Simon Peon. Early in the morning  our luggage was sent forward on the backs of mules and Indians, and we  had only to take leave of our friends. Our landlord refused to receive  the four dollars due to him for rent.  The pleasure of our society, he  said, was compensation enough, and between friends house-rent was not  to be thought of. We bade him an affectionate farewell, and in all  probability \"we ne'er shall see his like again,\" at least in this  matter of house-rent. We breakfasted for the last time with our  countrymen, including Mr. Fisher and Captain M'Kinley, who had arrived  that morning direct from New-York, at the house of the Dona Micaela,  and, attended by the good wishes of all for our safety and success,  mounted for our journey into the interior.    It was our intention to resume our explorations at Uxmal, the point  where we were interrupted by the illness of Mr. Catherwood. We had  received intelligence, however, of the ruins of Mayapan, an ancient  city which had never been visited, about eight leagues distant from  Merida, and but a few leagues aside from the road, by the haciendas, to  Uxmal. The accounts which we could obtain were meager, and it was  represented as completely in ruins; but, in fulfilment of the purpose  we at that time entertained of going to every place of which we heard  any account whatever, we determined to visit this on our way to Uxmal.  It was for Mayapan, therefore, that we were now setting out.    Our saddles, bridles, holsters, and pistols, being entirely different  from the mountings of horsemen in that country, attracted all eyes as  we rode through the streets. A friend accompanied us beyond the  suburbs, and put us into a straight road, which led, without turning,  to the end of our day's journey. Instead of the ominous warnings we  were accustomed to receive in Central America, his parting words were,  that there was no danger of robbers, or of any other interruptions.    Under these favourable circumstances, in good health and spirits, with  recommendations from the government to its officers in different  sections of the country, and through the newspapers to the hospitality  of citizens in the interior, we set out on our journey. We had before  us a new and unexplored region, in which we might expect to find new  scenes every day. There was but one drawback. We had no servant or  attendant of any kind, our friends having been disappointed in  procuring those which were expected. This, however, did not give us  much uneasiness.    The day was overcast, which saved us from the scorching sun, that  otherwise, at this hour, would have molested us. The road was straight,  level, stony, and uninteresting. On both sides were low, thick woods,  so that there was no view except that of the road before us; and  already, in the beginning of our journey, we felt that, if we were safe  from the confusion and danger which had attended us in Central America,  we had lost, too, the mountains, valleys, volcanoes, rivers, and all  the wild and magnificent scenery that gave a charm to the country in  spite of the difficulties and dangers by which travelling was there  attended.    I would remark that no map of Yucatan at all to be depended on has ever  been published. The Dona Joaquina Peon had one in manuscript, which she  was so kind as to place at our disposal, but with notice that it was  not correct; and, in order to keep a record of our own track from the  time we left Merida until we returned to it, we took the bearings of  the roads, noted the number of hours on each day's journey, and the  pace of our horses, and at some places Mr. Catherwood took an  observation for latitude. From these memoranda our map is prepared. It  is correct so far as regards our route, but does not fix accurately the  location of places which we did not visit.    At the distance of a league we passed a fine cattle hacienda, and at  twenty minutes past one reached Timucui, a small "]]]
