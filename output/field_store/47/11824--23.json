If you meet one in your walk in the twilight fields, the chances  are that you will turn out for him, not he for you. He may even pursue  you, just for the fun of seeing you run. He comes waltzing toward you,  apparently in the most hilarious spirits.    The coon is probably the most courageous creature among our familiar  wild animals. Who ever saw a coon show the white feather? He will face  any odds with perfect composure. I have seen a coon upon the ground,  beset by four men and two dogs, and never for a moment losing his  presence of mind, or showing a sign of fear. The raccoon is clear grit.    The fox is a very wild and suspicious creature, but curiously enough,  when you suddenly come face to face with him, when he is held by a trap,  or driven by the hound, his expression is not that of fear, but of  shame and guilt. He seems to diminish in size and to be overwhelmed with  humiliation. Does he know himself to be an old thief, and is that the  reason of his embarrassment? The fox has no enemies but man, and when he  is fairly outwitted he looks the shame he evidently feels.    In the heart of the rabbit fear constantly abides. How her eyes  protrude! She can see back and forward and on all sides as well as a  bird. The fox is after her, the owls are after her, the gunners are  after her, and she has no defense but her speed. She always keeps well  to cover. The northern hare keeps in the thickest brush. If the hare or  rabbit crosses a broad open exposure it does so hurriedly, like a mouse  when it crosses the road. The mouse is in danger of being pounced upon  by a hawk, and the hare or rabbit by the snowy owl, or else the great  horned owl.    A friend of mine was following one morning a fresh rabbit track through  an open field. Suddenly the track came to an end, as if the creature had  taken wings,--as it had after an unpleasant fashion. There, on either  side of its last foot imprint, were several parallel lines in the snow,  made by the wings of the great owl that had swooped down and carried it  off. What a little tragedy was seen written there upon the white, even  surface of the field!    The rabbit has not much wit. Once, when a boy, I saw one that had been  recently caught, liberated in an open field in the presence of a dog  that was being held a few yards away. The poor thing lost all presence  of mind, and was quickly caught by the clumsy dog.    A hunter once saw a hare running upon the ice along the shore of one of  the Rangeley lakes. Presently a lynx appeared in hot pursuit; as soon as  the hare found it was being pursued, it began to circle, foolish thing.  This gave the lynx greatly the advantage, as it could follow in a much  smaller circle. Soon the hare was run down and seized.    I saw a similar experiment tried with a red squirrel with quite opposite  results. The boy who had caught the squirrel in his wire trap had a very  bright and nimble dog about the size of a fox, that seemed to be very  sure he could catch a red squirrel under any circumstances if only the  trees were out of the way. So the boy went to the middle of an open  field with his caged squirrel, the dog, who seemed to know what was up,  dancing and jumping about him. It was in midwinter; the snow had a firm  crust that held boy and dog alike. The dog was drawn back a few yards  and the squirrel liberated.    Then began one of the most exciting races I have witnessed for a long  time. It was impossible for the lookers-on not to be convulsed with  laughter, though neither dog nor squirrel seemed to regard the matter as  much of a joke. The squirrel had all his wits about him, and kept them  ready for instant use. He did not show the slightest confusion. He was  no match for the dog in fair running, and he discovered this fact in  less than three seconds; he must win, if at all, by strategy. Not a  straight course for the nearest tree, but a zigzag course, yea, a double  or treble zigzag course. Every instant the dog was sure the squirrel was  his, and every instant he was disappointed. It was incredible and  bewildering to him. The squirrel dodged this way and that. The dog  looked astonished and vexed. Then the squirrel issued from between his  enemy's hind legs and made three jumps towards the woods before he was  discovered. Our sides ached with laughter, cruel as it may seem.    It was evident the squirrel would win. The dog seemed to redouble his  efforts. He would overshoot the game, or shoot by it to the right or  left. The squirrel was the smaller craft, and could out-tack him  easily. One more leap and the squirrel was up a tree, and the dog was  overwhelmed with confusion and disgust. He could not believe his senses.  \"Not catch a squirrel in such a field as that? Go to, I will have him  yet!\" and he bounded up the tree as high as one's head, and then bit the  bark of it in his anger and chagrin.    The boy says his dog has never bragged since about catching red  squirrels \"if only the trees were out of reach!\"    When any of the winged creatures are engaged in a life and death race in  that way, or in any other race, the tactics of the squirrel do not work;  the pursuer never overshoots nor shoots by his mark. The flight of the  two is timed as if they were parts of one whole. A hawk will pursue a  sparrow or a robin through a zigzag course and not lose a stroke or half  a stroke of the wing by reason of any darting to the right or left. The  clue is held with fatal precision. No matter how quickly nor how often  the sparrow or the finch changes its course, its enemy changes,  simultaneously, as if every move was known to it from the first.    The same thing may be noticed among the birds in their love chasings;  the pursuer seems to know perfectly the mind of the pursued. This  concert of action among birds is very curious. When they are on the  alert, a flock of sparrows, or pigeons, or cedar-birds, or snow  buntings, or blackbirds, will all take flight as if there were but one  bird, instead of a hundred. The same impulse seizes every individual  bird at the same instant, as if they were sprung by electricity.    Or when a flock of birds is in flight, it is still one body, one will;  it will rise, or circle, or swoop with a unity that is truly  astonishing.    A flock of snow buntings will perform their aerial evolutions with a  precision that the best-trained soldiery cannot equal. Have the birds an  extra sense which we have not? A brood of young partridges in the woods  will start up like an explosion, every brown particle and fragment  hurled into the air at the same instant. Without word or signal, how is  it done?          INDEX        Birds, simultaneous action in flight, 143, 144.      Calf, 138.

Builders were  immediately employed to turn two sets of rooms into an oratory. In a  few weeks the Roman Catholic rites were publicly performed in University  College. A Jesuit was quartered there as chaplain. A press was  established there under royal license for the printing of Roman Catholic  tracts. During two years and a half, Walker continued to make war on  Protestantism with all the rancour of a renegade: but when fortune  turned he showed that he wanted the courage of a martyr. He was brought  to the bar of the House of Commons to answer for his conduct, and was  base enough to protest that he had never changed his religion, that he  had never cordially approved of the doctrines of the Church of Rome,  and that he had never tried to bring any other person within the pale  of that Church. It was hardly worth while to violate the most sacred  obligations of law and of plighted faith, for the purpose of making such  converts as these. [89]    In a short time the King went a step further. Sclater and Walker had  only been permitted to keep, after they became Papists, the preferment  which had been bestowed on them while they passed for Protestants. To  confer a high office in the Established Church on an avowed enemy of  that Church was a far bolder violation of the laws and of the royal  word. But no course was too bold for James. The Deanery of Christchurch  became vacant. That office was, both in dignity and in emolument, one of  the highest in the University of Oxford. The Dean was charged with the  government of a greater number of youths of high connections and of  great hopes than could then be found in any other college. He was also  the head of a Cathedral. In both characters it was necessary that he  should be a member of the Church of England. Nevertheless John Massey,  who was notoriously a member of the Church of Rome, and who had not  one single recommendation, except that he was a member of the Church of  Rome, was appointed by virtue of the dispensing power; and soon within  the walls of Christchurch an altar was decked, at which mass was daily  celebrated. [90] To the Nuncio the King said that what had been done at  Oxford should very soon be done at Cambridge. [91]    Yet even this was a small evil compared with that which Protestants  had good ground to apprehend. It seemed but too probable that the whole  government of the Anglican Church would shortly pass into the hands of  her deadly enemies. Three important sees had lately become vacant, that  of York, that of Chester, and that of Oxford. The Bishopric of Oxford  was given to Samuel Parker, a parasite, whose religion, if he had any  religion, was that of Rome, and who called himself a Protestant only  because he was encumbered with a wife. \"I wished,\" the King said to  Adda, \"to appoint an avowed Catholic: but the time is not come. Parker  is well inclined to us; he is one of us in feeling; and by degrees he  will bring round his clergy.\" [92] The Bishopric of Chester, vacant by the  death of John Pearson, a great name both in philology and in divinity,  was bestowed on Thomas Cartwright, a still viler sycophant than Parker.  The Archbishopric of York remained several years vacant. As no good  reason could be found for leaving so important a place unfilled, men  suspected that the nomination was delayed only till the King could  venture to place the mitre on the head of an avowed Papist. It is indeed  highly probable that the Church of England was saved from this outrage  by the good sense and good feeling of the Pope. Without a special  dispensation from Rome no Jesuit could be a Bishop; and Innocent could  not be induced to grant such a dispensation to Petre.    James did not even make any secret of his intention to exert vigorously  and systematically for the destruction of the Established Church all the  powers which he possessed as her head. He plainly said that, by a wise  dispensation of Providence, the Act of Supremacy would be the means of  healing the fatal breach which it had caused. Henry and Elizabeth had  usurped a dominion which rightfully belonged to the Holy See. That  dominion had, in the course of succession, descended to an orthodox  prince, and would be held by him in trust for the Holy See. He was  authorised by law to repress spiritual abuses; and the first spiritual  abuse which he would repress should be the liberty which the Anglican  clergy assumed of defending their own religion and of attacking the  doctrines of Rome. [93]    But he was met by a great difficulty. The ecclesiastical supremacy  which had devolved on him, was by no means the same great and terrible  prerogative which Elizabeth, James the First, and Charles the First had  possessed. The enactment which annexed to the crown an almost boundless  visitatorial authority over the Church, though it had never been  formally repealed, had really lost a great part of its force. The  substantive law remained; but it remained unaccompanied by any  formidable sanction or by any efficient system of procedure, and was  therefore little more than a dead letter.    The statute, which restored to Elizabeth the spiritual dominion assumed  by her father and resigned by her sister, contained a clause authorising  the sovereign to constitute a tribunal which might investigate, reform,  and punish all ecclesiastical delinquencies. Under the authority given  by this clause, the Court of High Commission was created. That court  was, during many years, the terror of Nonconformists, and, under the  harsh administration of Laud, became an object of fear and hatred even  to those who most loved the Established Church. When the Long Parliament  met, the High Commission was generally regarded as the most grievous  of the many grievances under which the nation laboured. An act was  therefore somewhat hastily passed, which not only took away from the  Crown the power of appointing visitors to superintend the Church, but  abolished all ecclesiastical courts without distinction.    After the Restoration, the Cavaliers who filled the House of Commons,  zealous as they were for the prerogative, still remembered with  bitterness the tyranny of the High Commission, and were by no means  disposed to revive an institution so odious. They at the same time  thought, and not without reason, that the statute which had swept away  all the courts Christian of the realm, without providing any substitute,  was open to grave objection. They accordingly repealed that statute,  with the exception of the part which related to the High Commission.  Thus, the Archidiaconal Courts, the Consistory Courts, the Court of  Arches, the Court of Peculiars, and the Court of Delegates were revived:  but the enactment by which Elizabeth and her successors had been  empowered to appoint Commissioners with visitatorial authority over  the Church was not only not revived, but was declared, with the utmost  strength of language, to be completely abrogated. It is therefore as  clear as any point of constitutional law can be that James the Second  was not competent to appoint a Commission with power to visit and govern  the Church of England. [94] But, if this were so, it was to little  purpose that the Act of Supremacy, in high sounding words, empowered  him to amend what was amiss in that Church. Nothing but a machinery as  stringent as that which the Long Parliament had destroyed could force  the Anglican clergy to become his agents for the destruction of the  Anglican doctrine and discipline. He therefore, as early as the month  of April 1686, determined to create a new Court of High Commission. This  design was not immediately executed. It encountered the opposition of  every minister who was not devoted to France and to the Jesuits. It  was regarded by lawyers as an outrageous violation of the law, and by  Churchmen as a direct attack upon the Church. Perhaps the contest  might have lasted longer, but for an event which wounded the pride and  inflamed the rage of the King. He had, as supreme ordinary, put forth  directions, charging the clergy of the establishment to abstain from  touching in their discourses on controverted points of doctrine. Thus,  while sermons in defence of the Roman Catholic religion were preached on  every Sunday and holiday within the precincts of the royal palaces, the  Church of the state, the Church of the great majority of the nation, was  forbidden to explain and vindicate her own principles. The spirit of the  whole clerical order rose against this injustice. William Sherlock,  a divine of distinguished abilities, who had written with sharpness  against Whigs and Dissenters, and had been rewarded by the government  with the Mastership of the Temple and with a pension, was one of the  first who incurred the royal displeasure. His pension was stopped, and  he was severely reprimanded. [95] John Sharp, Dean of Norwich and Rector  of St. Giles's in the Fields, soon gave still greater offence. He was  a man of learning and fervent piety, a preacher of great fame, and an  exemplary parish priest. In politics he was, like most of his brethren,  a Tory, and had just been appointed one of the royal chaplains. He  received an anonymous letter which purported to come from one of his  parishioners who had been staggered by the arguments of Roman Catholic  theologians, and who was anxious to be satisfied that the Church of  England was a branch of the true Church of Christ. No divine, not  utterly lost to all sense of religious duty and of professional honour,  could refuse to answer such a call. On the following Sunday Sharp  delivered an animated discourse against the high pretensions of the  see of Rome. Some of his expressions were exaggerated, distorted, and  carried by talebearers to Whitehall. It was falsely said that he had  spoken with contumely of the theological disquisitions which had been  found in the strong box of the late King, and"]]]
