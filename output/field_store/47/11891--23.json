The    economy has improved significantly since the fall of the Taliban    regime in 2001 largely because of the infusion of international    assistance, the recovery of the agricultural sector, and service    sector growth. Real GDP growth probably exceeded 8% in 2006. Despite    the progress of the past few years, Afghanistan is extremely poor,    landlocked, and highly dependent on foreign aid, agriculture, and    trade with neighboring countries. Much of the population continues    to suffer from shortages of housing, clean water, electricity,    medical care, and jobs. Criminality, insecurity, and the Afghan    Government's inability to extend rule of law to all parts of the    country pose challenges to future economic growth. It will probably    take the remainder of the decade and continuing donor aid and    attention to significantly raise Afghanistan's living standards from    its current status, among the lowest in the world. While the    international community remains committed to Afghanistan's    development, pledging over $24 billion at three donors' conferences    since 2002, Kabul will need to overcome a number of challenges.    Expanding poppy cultivation and a growing opium trade generate    roughly $3 billion in illicit economic activity and looms as one of    Kabul's most serious policy concerns. Other long-term challenges    include: budget sustainability, job creation, corruption, government    capacity, and rebuilding war torn infrastructure.

He pressed his old friend to his heart, saying, in a voice full of  pathos,--    \"O Le Gardeur! I recognize you now, but under what change of look and  place! Often have I forecast our meeting again, but it was in your  pure, virtuous home of Tilly, not in this place. What do you here, Le  Gardeur?\"    \"Forgive me, Pierre, for the shame of meeting me here.\" Le Gardeur stood  up like a new man in the glance of his friend; the shock seemed to have  sobered him at once. \"'What do I do here?' say you, O dear friend!\"  said he, glancing round the hall, \"it is easier seen than told what I do  here. But by all the saints, I have finished here for to-day! You return  to the city at once, Pierre?\"    \"At once, Le Gardeur. The Governor awaits my return.\"    \"Then I will return with you. My dear aunt and sister are in the city.  News of their arrival reached me here; my duty was to return at once,  but the Intendant's wine-cups were too potent for me--curse them, for  they have disgraced me in your eyes, Pierre, as well as my own!\"    Philibert started at the information that Amelie was in the city.  \"Amelie in the city?\" repeated he, with glad surprise, \"I did not expect  to be able to salute her and the noble Lady de Tilly so soon.\" His heart  bounded in secret at the prospect of again seeing this fair girl, who  had filled his thoughts for so many years and been the secret spring of  so much that was noble and manly in his character.    \"Come, Le Gardeur, let us take leave of the Intendant, and return at  once to the city, but not in that plight!\" added he, smiling, as Le  Gardeur, oblivious of all but the pleasure of accompanying him, grasped  his arm to leave the great hall. \"Not in that garb, Le Gardeur! Bathe,  purify, and clean yourself; I will wait outside in the fresh air. The  odor of this room stifles me!\"    \"You are not going to leave us, Le Gardeur!\" Varin called, across  the table, \"and break up good company? Wait till we finish a few more  rounds, and we will all go together.\"    \"I have finished all the rounds for to-day, Varin, may be forever!  Colonel Philibert is my dearest friend in life; I must leave even you to  go with him, so pray excuse me.\"    \"You are excused, Le Gardeur.\" Bigot spoke very courteously to him, much  as he disliked the idea of his companionship with Philibert. \"We must  all return by the time the Cathedral bells chime noon. Take one parting  cup before you go, Le Gardeur, and prevail on Colonel Philibert to do  the same, or he will not praise our hospitality, I fear.\"    \"Not one drop more this day, were it from Jove's own poculum!\" Le  Gardeur repelled the temptation more readily as he felt a twitch on his  sleeve from the hand of Philibert.    \"Well, as you will, Le Gardeur; we have all had enough and over, I dare  say. Ha! ha! Colonel Philibert rather puts us to the blush, or would  were not our cheeks so well-painted in the hues of rosy Bacchus.\"    Philibert, with official courtesy, bade adieu to the Intendant and the  company. A couple of valets waited upon Le Gardeur, whom they assisted  to bathe and dress. In a short time he left the Chateau almost sobered,  and wholly metamorphosed into a handsome, fresh chevalier. A perverse  redness about the eyes alone remained, to tell the tale of the last  night's debauch.    Master Pothier sat on a horse-block at the door with all the gravity  of a judge, while he waited for the return of Colonel Philibert and  listened to the lively noise in the Chateau, the music, song, and jingle  of glass forming a sweet concert in the ears of the jolly old notary.    \"I shall not need you to guide me back, Master Pothier,\" said Philibert,  as he put some silver pieces in his hollow palm; \"take your fee. The  cause is gained, is it not, Le Gardeur?\" He glanced triumphantly at his  friend.    \"Good-by, Master Pothier,\" said he, as he rode off with Le Gardeur. The  old notary could not keep up with them, but came jolting on behind, well  pleased to have leisure to count and jingle his coins. Master Pothier  was in that state of joyful anticipation when hope outruns realization.  He already saw himself seated in the old armchair in the snug parlor  of Dame Bedard's inn, his back to the fire, his belly to the table, a  smoking dish of roast in the middle, an ample trencher before him with a  bottle of Cognac on one flank and a jug of Norman cider on the other, an  old crony or two to eat and drink with him, and the light foot and deft  hand of pretty Zoe Bedard to wait upon them.    This picture of perfect bliss floated before the winking eyes of Master  Pothier, and his mouth watered in anticipation of his Eden, not of  flowers and trees, but of tables, cups, and platters, with plenty to  fill them, and to empty them as well.    \"A worthy gentleman and a brave officer, I warrant!\" said Pothier, as he  jogged along. \"He is generous as a prince, and considerate as a bishop,  fit for a judge, nay, for a chief justice! What would you do for  him, Master Pothier?\" the old notary asked himself. \"I answer the  interrogatory of the Court: I would draw up his marriage contract, write  his last will and testament with the greatest of pleasure and without  a fee!--and no notary in New France could do more for him!\" Pothier's  imagination fell into a vision over a consideration of his favorite  text--that of the great sheet, wherein was all manner of flesh and fowl  good for food, but the tongue of the old notary would trip at the name  of Peter, and perversely say, \"Rise, Pothier; kill, and eat.\"        CHAPTER IX. PIERRE PHILIBERT.      Colonel Philibert and Le Gardeur rode rapidly through the forest of  Beaumanoir, pulling up occasionally in an eager and sympathetic exchange  of questions and replies, as they recounted the events of their lives  since their separation, or recalled their school-days and glorious  holidays and rambles in the woods of Tilly--with frequent mention of  their gentle, fair companion, Amelie de Repentigny, whose name on the  lips of her brother sounded sweeter than the chime of the bells of  Charlebourg to the ear of Pierre Philibert.    The bravest man in New France felt a tremor in his breast as he asked Le  Gardeur a seemingly careless question--seemingly, for, in truth, it was  vital in the last degree to his happiness, and he knew it. He expressed  a fear that Amelie would have wholly forgotten him after so long an  absence from New France.    His heart almost ceased beating as he waited the reply of Le Gardeur,  which came impetuously: \"Forgotten you, Pierre Philibert? She would  forget me as soon! But for you she would have had no brother to-day, and  in her prayers she ever remembers both of us--you by right of a sister's  gratitude, me because I am unworthy of her saintly prayers and need them  all the more! O Pierre Philibert, you do not know Amelie if you think  she is one ever to forget a friend like you!\"    The heart of Philibert gave a great leap for joy. Too happy for speech,  he rode on a while in silence.    \"Amelie will have changed much in appearance?\" he asked, at last. A  thousand questions were crowding upon his lips.    \"Changed? Oh, yes!\" replied Le Gardeur, gaily. \"I scarcely recognize my  little bright-eyed sister in the tall, perfect young lady that has taken  her place. But the loving heart, the pure mind, the gentle ways, and  winning smiles are the same as ever. She is somewhat more still and  thoughtful, perhaps--more strict in the observances of religion. You  will remember, I used to call her in jest our St. Amelie: I might call  her that in earnest now, Pierre, and she would be worthy of the name!\"    \"God bless you, Le Gardeur!\" burst out Colonel Philibert,--his voice  could not repress the emotion he felt,--\"and God bless Amelie! Think you  she would care to see me to-day, Le Gardeur?\" Philibert's thoughts  flew far and fast, and his desire to know more of Amelie was a rack  of suspense to him. She might, indeed, recollect the youth Pierre  Philibert, thought he, as she did a sunbeam that gladdened long-past  summers; but how could he expect her to regard him--the full-grown  man--as the same? Nay, was he not nursing a fatal fancy in his breast  that would sting him to death? for among the gay and gallant throng  about the capital was it not more than possible that so lovely and  amiable a woman had already been wooed, and given the priceless treasure  of her love to another? It was, therefore, with no common feeling that  Philibert said, \"Think you she will care to see me to-day, Le Gardeur?\"    \"Care to see you, Pierre Philibert? What a question! She and Aunt de  Tilly take every occasion to remind me of you, by way of example, to  shame me of my faults--and they succeed, too! I could cut off my right  hand this moment, Pierre, that it should never lift wine again to my  lips--and to have been seen by you in such company! What must you think  of me?\"    \"I think your regret could not surpass mine; but tell me how you have  been drawn into these rapids and taken the wrong turn, Le Gardeur?\"    Le Gardeur winced as he replied,--\"Oh, I do not know. I found myself  there before I thought. It was the wit, wine, and enchantments of Bigot,  I suppose,--and the greatest temptation of all, a woman's smiles,--that  led me to take the wrong turn, as you call it. There, you have my  confession!--and I would put my sword through any man but you, Pierre,  who dared ask me to give such an account of myself. I am ashamed of it  all, Pierre Philibert!\"    \"Thanks, Le Gardeur, for your confidence. I hope you will outride this  storm!\" He held out his hand, nervous and sinewy as that of Mars. Le  Gardeur seized it, and pressed it hard in his. \"Don't you think it is  still able to rescue a friend from peril?\" added Philibert smiling.    Le Gardeur caught his meaning, and gave him a look of unutterable"]]]
