He was  on horseback at the time, and soon came across a man lying in the shade,  probably overcome by the heat. He started to speak to the Rough Rider  when a bullet hit the fellow and killed him on the spot.    \"I suppose that bullet was meant for me,\" says Mr. Roosevelt, in writing  of this incident. \"I, who was on horseback in the open, was unhurt, and  the man lying flat on the ground in the cover beside me was killed.\"    The fight had now centred around the possession of San Juan Hill, upon  which was located a Spanish blockhouse. The bullets were flying as  thickly as ever, when Roosevelt was ordered to advance in support of  another regiment. As the Rough Riders reached the spot where the other  regiment was, they found the men lying down awaiting orders.    \"I am ordered to support your regiment,\" said Theodore Roosevelt to the  first captain he met.    \"We are awaiting orders to advance,\" answered the captain of the  regulars.    \"In my opinion we cannot take these hills by firing at them,\" returned  the commander of the Rough Riders. \"We must rush them.\"    \"My orders are to keep my men where they are.\"    \"Where is your Colonel?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Well, if he isn't here, then I am the ranking officer, and I give the  order to charge,\" came quickly and positively from Theodore Roosevelt.    \"Well, sir,--I--I have orders from our Colonel--\" began the captain of  the regulars.    \"If you won't charge, let my men pass through, sir,\" cut in the Acting  Colonel of the Rough Riders, and he ordered his men to move to the  front. This was too much for the regulars, and up they sprang with  shouts and yells, and Rough Riders and regulars went up San Juan Hill  together. Roosevelt was on horseback as before, but at a barbed-wire  fence he leaped to the ground, swung his hat in the air, and joined his  men on foot.    The fight was now at its fiercest, and men were being mowed down in all  directions. But the fever of battle was in the veins of all the American  soldiers, and nothing could stop them. Up the hill they went, loading  and firing at random, and making as many shots as possible tell. The  Spaniards were in retreat, and soon Old Glory was planted in several  places. Some of the leading officers had been shot, and Theodore  Roosevelt found himself at one time in command of five regiments, and  doing his best to keep them in military order. Strange as it may seem,  with bullets flying all around him, he remained unharmed, saving for  some slight scratches which, he tells us, \"were of no consequence.\"    With the top of the hill gained, the American soldiers could get a  distant glimpse of Santiago, several miles away, and some wanted to move  still farther forward. But the Spaniards had strong intrenchments to  fall back upon, and it was deemed best to \"let well enough alone.\"  Accordingly the American line was made as strong as possible, and by  nightfall the battle was at an end, and the Rough Riders were told to  hold the hill and intrench, and they did so. In the blockhouse they  found some food belonging to some Spanish officers, and upon this they  feasted after their well-earned victory.          CHAPTER XVI    RESULTS OF THE FIGHT--LIFE IN THE TRENCHES--THE SPANISH FLEET IN  SANTIAGO HARBOR--ANOTHER GREAT NAVAL VICTORY--THE ROUGH RIDERS AND THE  SPANISH GUERILLAS      The fight had been a hard and heavy one. The Rough Riders had gone into  the engagement just 490 strong, and of that number 89 were killed or  wounded. The total loss to the Americans was 1071 killed and wounded.  The loss to the Spanish was also heavy, but the exact figures will  probably never be known.    Utterly tired out with their marching and fighting, the Rough Riders  intrenched as best they could, cared for their wounded and dead, and  then dropped down to get a well-earned rest. The night was misty and  cold, and many who had been bathed in perspiration suffered accordingly.  Theodore Roosevelt had a blanket taken from the Spanish, and in this he  rolled himself, and slept with others of his command.    At three o'clock in the morning came an unexpected alarm. The Spanish  skirmishers were out in force, trying to drive the Americans back. But  there was no heavy attack, and presently all became as quiet as before.    \"They'll not give up yet,\" said one of the officers of the Rough Riders.  \"They mean to retake this hill if they can.\"    Just at daybreak the Spaniards opened the attack on San Juan Hill once  more. Theodore Roosevelt was resting under a little tree when a shrapnel  shell burst close by, killing or wounding five men of the command. He at  once ordered the eight troops under him to a safer position, where the  Spanish battery and the sharpshooters could not locate them so readily.    If the fight had been hard, guarding the trenches was almost equally so.  The sun beat down fiercely, and the newly turned up earth made many of  the Rough Riders sick. Added to this, provisions were, as usual, slow in  arriving. Those in the trenches were kept there six hours, and then  relieved by the others who were farther to the rear.    \"Running from the cover of brush to the trenches was no easy matter,\"  says one Rough Rider who was there. \"We had dug the trenches in a hurry,  and had no passages from the rear leading to them. All we could do was  to wait for a signal, and then rush, and when we did that, the Spaniards  would open a hot fire and keep it up for perhaps fifteen minutes. The  sun was enough to turn a man's brain, and more than one poor fellow  caught a fever there that proved fatal to him.\"    Through the entire day the firing continued, but no advances were made  upon either side. The Americans were waiting for reinforcements, and the  Spaniards were doing likewise. On our side a dynamite gun and two Colt's  guns were used, but with little success. But the Gatling guns proved  very effective, and caused a great loss to the enemy.    The city of Santiago lies on the northeast coast of a large bay of the  same name. This bay is shaped somewhat like a bottle, with a long neck  joining it to the Caribbean Sea.    In the harbor, at the time of the battles just described, the Spaniards  had a fleet of war-ships under the command of Admiral Cervera, an old  and able naval commander. In the fleet were four large cruisers and two  torpedo-boats. Three of the cruisers were of seven thousand tons burden  each, and all could make from eighteen to nineteen knots an hour. Each  carried a crew of about five hundred men, and all were well supplied  with guns and ammunition.    To keep this fleet \"bottled up,\" our own navy had a fleet of its own  just outside of the harbor, where it had been stationed ever since  Admiral Cervera had been discovered within. The American fleet consisted  of the cruiser _Brooklyn_, which was Commodore Schley's flag-ship, the  battleships _Texas_, _Iowa_, _Indiana_, and _Oregon_ (the latter having  sailed all the way from the Pacific coast around Cape Horn to get into  the fight), and the converted yachts _Gloucester_ and _Vixen_. There  were also close at hand, but not near enough to get into the fight, the  cruiser _New York_, Admiral Sampson's flag-ship, and several other  vessels of lesser importance.    For a long time it had been thought that Cervera would try to escape  from the harbor, in which he could not be reached because of the strong  forts that protected the entrance. To bottle him up more effectively,  the Americans tried to block up the harbor entrance by sinking an old  iron steamboat, the _Merrimac_, in the channel. This heroic work was  undertaken by Lieutenant Hobson with a crew of seven daring men, but the  plan failed, for the _Merrimac_, instead of sinking where intended,  swung to one side of the main channel.    When it was reported to him that the Americans had taken the heights of  El Caney and San Juan and were strongly intrenched in their positions,  Admiral Cervera concluded that Santiago Bay might soon become too hot to  hold him. The capture of the city would be followed by the taking of the  forts at the harbor entrance, and then there would be nothing left for  him to do but to surrender.    San Juan and El Caney had been taken on Friday, and all day Saturday  occurred the shooting at long range, as already described. In the  meantime the war-ships outside of the harbor kept up a close watch on  the harbor entrance, lying well out during the day, but coming in closer  at night, and using their powerful search-lights from sundown to  sunrise.    Sunday dawned bright and clear, and for the time being all was quiet  both ashore and afloat. In the trenches the Rough Riders and other  soldiers were still on guard, doing what they could for their wounded,  and trying to get the rations which were still delayed.    Presently, those on board of the American fleet noticed a thick cloud of  smoke hanging over the harbor, coming from the funnels of the Spanish  war-ships. Then one of the enemy's vessels showed itself, quickly  followed by the others, and all turned westward, to escape up the coast.    \"The enemy is escaping!\" was the signal hoisted. And then one cannon  after another boomed out, giving the signal to all our ships in that  vicinity. The booming of the cannon was heard away eastward at Siboney,  whither Admiral Sampson had gone with his ship to confer with General  Shafter, and without delay the _New York_ raced madly back to get into  the fight that followed.    \"Remember the _Maine!_\" was the cry. \"Down with the Spanish ships! Give  'em what Dewey did!\" And this cry, \"Give 'em what Dewey did!\" was heard  on every hand.    The first vessel to go down was a torpedo-boat, sunk by the  _Gloucester_, and this was quickly followed by the sinking of the second  torpedo-boat. In the meantime the larger vessels were pouring in their  rain of steel upon the Spanish"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22373"],[0,"Russian Fairy Tales: A Choice Collection of Muscovite Folk-lore (#18)"],[1,"they  were not satisfied until they had devised a plan to effect his  removal, and, as they hoped, accomplish his destruction.\"[91] We know  also that \"Israel loved Joseph more than all his children,\" because he  was the son \"of his old age,\" and the result was that \"when his  brethren [who were only his half-brothers] saw that their father loved  him more than all his brethren, they hated him.\"[92] When such tales  as these came west in Christian times, their references to polygamy  were constantly suppressed, and their distinctions between brothers  and half-brothers disappeared. In the same way the elder and jealous  wife, who had behaved with cruelty in the original stories to the  offspring of her rival, often became turned, under Christian  influences, into a stepmother who hated her husband's children by a  previous marriage.    There may, however, be a mythological explanation of the behavior of  the two elder brothers. Professor de Gubernatis is of opinion that \"in  the Vedic hymns, Tritas, the third brother, and the ablest as well as  best, is persecuted by his brothers,\" who, \"in a fit of jealousy, on  account of his wife, the aurora, and the riches she brings with her  from the realm of darkness, the cistern or well [into which he has  been lowered], detain their brother in the well,\"[93] and he compares  this form of the myth with that which it assumes in the following  Hindoo tradition. \"Three brothers, _Ekata_ (_i.e._ the first), _Dwita_  (_i.e._ the second) and _Trita_ (_i.e._ the third) were travelling in  a desert, and being distressed with thirst, came to a well, from which  the youngest, Trita, drew water and gave it to his brothers; in  requital, they drew him into the well, in order to appropriate his  property and having covered the top with a cart-wheel, left him in the  well. In this extremity he prayed to the gods to extricate him, and by  their favor he made his escape.\"[94] This myth may, perhaps, be the  germ from which have sprung the numerous folk-tales about the  desertion of a younger brother in some pit or chasm, into which his  brothers have lowered him.[95]    It may seem more difficult to account for the willingness of Norka's  three sisters to aid in his destruction--unless, indeed, the whole  story be considered to be mythological, as its Indian equivalents  undoubtedly are. But in many versions of the same tale the difficulty  does not arise. The princesses of the copper, silver, and golden  realms, are usually represented as united by no ties of consanguinity  with the snake or other monster whom the hero comes to kill. In the  story of \"Usuinya,\"[96] for instance, there appears to be no  relationship between these fair maidens and the \"Usuinya-Bird,\" which  steals the golden apples from a monarch's garden and is killed by his  youngest son Ivan. That monster is not so much a bird as a flying  dragon. \"This Usuinya-bird is a twelve-headed snake,\" says one of the  fair maidens. And presently it arrives--its wings stretching afar,  while along the ground trail its moustaches [_usui_, whence its name].  In a variant of the same story in another collection,[97] the part of  Norka is played by a white wolf. In that of Ivan Suchenko[98] it is  divided among three snakes who have stolen as many princesses. For the  snake is much given to abduction, especially when he appears under the  terrible form of \"Koshchei, the Deathless.\"    Koshchei is merely one of the many incarnations of the dark spirit  which takes so many monstrous shapes in the folk-tales of the class  with which we are now dealing. Sometimes he is described as altogether  serpent-like in form; sometimes he seems to be of a mixed nature,  partly human and partly ophidian, but in some of the stories he is  apparently framed after the fashion of a man. His name is by some  mythologists derived from _kost'_, a bone whence comes a verb  signifying to become ossified, petrified, or frozen; either because he  is bony of limb, or because he produces an effect akin to freezing or  petrifaction.[99]    He is called \"Immortal\" or \"The Deathless,\"[100] because of his  superiority to the ordinary laws of existence. Sometimes, like Baldur,  he cannot be killed except by one substance; sometimes his  \"death\"--that is, the object with which his life is indissolubly  connected--does not exist within his body. Like the vital centre of  \"the giant who had no heart in his body\" in the well-known Norse tale,  it is something extraneous to the being whom it affects, and until it  is destroyed he may set all ordinary means of annihilation at  defiance. But this is not always the case, as may be learnt from one  of the best of the skazkas in which he plays a leading part, the  history of--        MARYA MOREVNA.[101]      In a certain kingdom there lived a Prince Ivan. He had three    sisters. The first was the Princess Marya, the second the Princess    Olga, the third the Princess Anna. When their father and    mother lay at the point of death, they had thus enjoined their    son:--\"Give your sisters in marriage to the very first suitors    who come to woo them. Don't go keeping them by you!\"      They died and the Prince buried them, and then, to solace his    grief, he went with his sisters into the garden green to stroll.    Suddenly the sky was covered by a black cloud; a terrible storm    arose.      \"Let us go home, sisters!\" he cried.      Hardly had they got into the palace, when the thunder    pealed, the ceiling split open, and into the room where they were,    came flying a falcon bright. The Falcon smote upon the ground,    became a brave youth, and said:      \"Hail, Prince Ivan! Before I came as a guest, but now I    have come as a wooer! I wish to propose for your sister, the    Princess Marya.\"      \"If you find favor in the eyes of my sister, I will not interfere    with her wishes. Let her marry you in God's name!\"      The Princess Marya gave her consent; the Falcon married    her and bore her away into his own realm.      Days follow days, hours chase hours; a whole year goes by.    One day Prince Ivan and his two sisters went out to stroll in    the garden green. Again there arose a stormcloud with whirlwind    and lightning.      \"Let us go home, sisters!\" cried the Prince. Scarcely had    they entered the palace, when the thunder crashed, the roof    burst into a blaze, the ceiling split in twain, and in flew an eagle.    The Eagle smote upon the ground and became a brave youth.      \"Hail, Prince Ivan! Before I came as a guest, but now I    have come as a wooer!\"      And he asked for the hand of the Princess Olga. Prince    Ivan replied:      \"If you find favor in the eyes of the Princess Olga, then let    her marry you. I will not interfere with her liberty of choice.\"      The Princess Olga gave her consent and married the Eagle.    The Eagle took her and carried her off to his own kingdom.      Another year went by. Prince Ivan said to his youngest    sister:      \"Let us go out and stroll in the garden green!\"      They strolled about for a time. Again there arose a stormcloud,    with whirlwind and lightning.      \"Let us return home, sister!\" said he.      They returned home, but they hadn't had time to sit down    when the thunder[102] crashed, the ceiling split open, and in flew    a raven. The Raven smote upon the floor and became a brave    youth. The former youths had been handsome, but this one    was handsomer still.      \"Well, Prince Ivan! Before I came as a guest, but now I    have come as a wooer. Give me the Princess Anna to wife.\"      \"I won't interfere with my sister's freedom. If you gain her    affections, let her marry you.\"      So the Princess Anna married the Raven, and he bore her    away to his own realm. Prince Ivan was left alone. A whole    year he lived without his sisters; then he grew weary, and    said:--      \"I will set out in search of my sisters.\"      He got ready for the journey, he rode and rode, and one day    he saw a whole army lying dead on the plain. He cried aloud,    \"If there be a living man there, let him make answer! who has    slain this mighty host?\"      There replied unto him a living man:      \"All this mighty host has been slain by the fair Princess    Marya Morevna.\"      Prince Ivan rode further on, and came to a white tent, and    forth came to meet him the fair Princess Marya Morevna.      \"Hail Prince!\" says she, \"whither does God send you?    and is it of your free will or against your will?\"      Prince Ivan replied, \"Not against their will do brave youths    ride!\"      \"Well, if your business be not pressing, tarry awhile in my    tent.\"      Thereat was Prince Ivan glad. He spent two nights in the    tent, and he found favor in the eyes of Marya Morevna, and    she married him. The fair Princess, Marya Morevna, carried    him off into her own realm.      They spent some time together, and then the Princess took    it into her head to go a warring. So she handed over all the    housekeeping affairs to Prince Ivan, and gave him these instructions:      \"Go about everywhere, keep watch over everything, only do    not venture to look into that closet there.\"      He couldn't help doing so. The moment Marya Morevna    had gone he rushed to the closet, pulled open the door, and    looked in--there hung Koshchei the Deathless, fettered by    twelve chains. Then Koshchei entreated Prince Ivan, saying,--      \"Have pity upon me and give me to drink! Ten years long    have I been here in torment, neither eating or drinking; my    throat is utterly dried up.\"      The Prince gave him a bucketful of water; he drank it up    and asked for more, saying:      \"A single bucket of water will not quench my thirst; give    me more!\"      The Prince gave him a second bucketful. Koshchei drank    it up and asked for a third, and when he had swallowed the    third bucketful, he regained his former strength, gave his chains    a shake, and broke all twelve at"]]]
