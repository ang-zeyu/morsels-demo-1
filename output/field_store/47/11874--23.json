[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2607"],[0,"Psmith, Journalist (#18)"],[1," merry in their company in a genial and law-abiding fashion, many,  many blocks below the scene of the regrettable assault. The  magistrate discharged the prisoner, and the prisoner, meeting Billy  and Psmith in the street outside, leered triumphantly at them.    Billy stepped up to him. \"You may have wriggled out of this,\" he  said furiously, \"but if you don't get a move on and quit looking at  me like that, I'll knock you over the Singer Building. Hump  yourself.\"    Mr. Repetto humped himself.    So was victory turned into defeat, and Billy's jaw became squarer  and his eye more full of the light of battle than ever. And there  was need of a square jaw and a battle-lit eye, for now began a  period of guerilla warfare such as no New York paper had ever had  to fight against.    It was Wheeler, the gaunt manager of the business side of the  journal, who first brought it to the notice of the editorial staff.  Wheeler was a man for whom in business hours nothing existed but  his job; and his job was to look after the distribution of the  paper. As to the contents of the paper he was absolutely ignorant.  He had been with _Cosy Moments_ from its start, but he had never read  a line of it. He handled it as if it were so much soap. The  scholarly writings of Mr. Wilberfloss, the mirth-provoking sallies  of Mr. B. Henderson Asher, the tender outpourings of Louella  Granville Waterman--all these were things outside his ken. He was a  distributor, and he distributed.    A few days after the restoration of Mr. Repetto to East Side  Society, Mr. Wheeler came into the editorial room with information  and desire for information.    He endeavoured to satisfy the latter first.    \"What's doing, anyway?\" he asked. He then proceeded to his  information. \"Some one's got it in against the paper, sure,\" he  said. \"I don't know what it's all about. I ha'n't never read the  thing. Don't see what any one could have against a paper with a  name like _Cosy Moments_, anyway. The way things have been going  last few days, seems it might be the organ of a blamed mining-camp  what the boys have took a dislike to.\"    \"What's been happening?\" asked Billy with gleaming eyes.    \"Why, nothing in the world to fuss about, only our carriers can't  go out without being beaten up by gangs of toughs. Pat Harrigan's  in the hospital now. Just been looking in on him. Pat's a feller  who likes to fight. Rather fight he would than see a ball-game. But  this was too much for him. Know what happened? Why, see here, just  like this it was. Pat goes out with his cart. Passing through a  low-down street on his way up-town he's held up by a bunch of  toughs. He shows fight. Half a dozen of them attend to him, while  the rest gets clean away with every copy of the paper there was in  the cart. When the cop comes along, there's Pat in pieces on the  ground and nobody in sight but a Dago chewing gum. Cop asks the  Dago what's been doing, and the Dago says he's only just come round  the corner and ha'n't seen nothing of anybody. What I want to know  is, what's it all about? Who's got it in for us and why?\"    Mr. Wheeler leaned back in his chair, while Billy, his hair rumpled  more than ever and his eyes glowing, explained the situation. Mr.  Wheeler listened absolutely unmoved, and, when the narrative had  come to an end, gave it as his opinion that the editorial staff had  sand. That was his sole comment. \"It's up to you,\" he said,  rising. \"You know your business. Say, though, some one had better  get busy right quick and do something to stop these guys  rough-housing like this. If we get a few more carriers beat up the  way Pat was, there'll be a strike. It's not as if they were all  Irishmen. The most of them are Dagoes and such, and they don't  want any more fight than they can get by beating their wives and  kicking kids off the sidewalk. I'll do my best to get this paper  distributed right and it's a shame if it ain't, because it's going  big just now--but it's up to you. Good day, gents.\"    He went out. Psmith looked at Billy.    \"As Comrade Wheeler remarks,\" he said, \"it is up to us. What do you  propose to do about it? This is a move of the enemy which I have  not anticipated. I had fancied that their operations would be  confined exclusively to our two selves. If they are going to strew  the street with our carriers, we are somewhat in the soup.\"    Billy said nothing. He was chewing the stem of an unlighted pipe.  Psmith went on.    \"It means, of course, that we must buck up to a certain extent. If  the campaign is to be a long one, they have us where the hair is  crisp. We cannot stand the strain. _Cosy Moments_ cannot be muzzled,  but it can undoubtedly be choked. What we want to do is to find  out the name of the man behind the tenements as soon as ever we can  and publish it; and, then, if we perish, fall yelling the name.\"    Billy admitted the soundness of this scheme, but wished to know how  it was to be done.    \"Comrade Windsor,\" said Psmith. \"I have been thinking this thing  over, and it seems to me that we are on the wrong track, or rather  we aren't on any track at all; we are simply marking time. What we  want to do is to go out and hustle round till we stir up something.  Our line up to the present has been to sit at home and scream  vigorously in the hope of some stout fellow hearing and rushing to  help. In other words, we've been saying in the paper what an  out-size in scugs the merchant must be who owns those tenements, in  the hope that somebody else will agree with us and be sufficiently  interested to get to work and find out who the blighter is. That's  all wrong. What we must do now, Comrade Windsor, is put on our  hats, such hats as Comrade Repetto has left us, and sally forth as  sleuth-hounds on our own account.\"    \"Yes, but how?\" demanded Billy. \"That's all right in theory, but  how's it going to work in practice? The only thing that can corner  the man is a commission.\"    \"Far from it, Comrade Windsor. The job may be worked more simply. I  don't know how often the rents are collected in these places, but I  should say at a venture once a week. My idea is to hang negligently  round till the rent-collector arrives, and when he has loomed up on  the horizon, buttonhole him and ask him quite politely, as man to  man, whether he is collecting those rents for himself or for  somebody else, and if somebody else, who that somebody else is.  Simple, I fancy? Yet brainy. Do you take me, Comrade Windsor?\"    Billy sat up, excited. \"I believe you've hit it.\"    Psmith shot his cuffs modestly.          CHAPTER XVIII    AN EPISODE BY THE WAY    It was Pugsy Maloney who, on the following morning, brought to the  office the gist of what is related in this chapter. Pugsy's version  was, however, brief and unadorned, as was the way with his  narratives. Such things as first causes and piquant details he  avoided, as tending to prolong the telling excessively, thus  keeping him from perusal of his cowboy stories. The way Pugsy put  it was as follows. He gave the thing out merely as an item of  general interest, a bubble on the surface of the life of a great  city. He did not know how nearly interested were his employers in  any matter touching that gang which is known as the Three Points.  Pugsy said: \"Dere's trouble down where I live. Dude Dawson's mad at  Spider Reilly, an' now de Table Hills are layin' for de T'ree  Points. Sure.\" He had then retired to his outer fastness, yielding  further details jerkily and with the distrait air of one whose mind  is elsewhere.    Skilfully extracted and pieced together, these details formed  themselves into the following typical narrative of East Side life  in New York.    The really important gangs of New York are four. There are other  less important institutions, but these are little more than mere  friendly gatherings of old boyhood chums for purposes of mutual  companionship. In time they may grow, as did Bat Jarvis's coterie,  into formidable organisations, for the soil is undoubtedly  propitious to such growth. But at present the amount of ice which  good judges declare them to cut is but small. They \"stick up\" an  occasional wayfarer for his \"cush,\" and they carry \"canisters\" and  sometimes fire them off, but these things do not signify the  cutting of ice. In matters political there are only four gangs  which count, the East Side, the Groome Street, the Three Points,  and the Table Hill. Greatest of these by virtue of their numbers  are the East Side and the Groome Street, the latter presided over  at the time of this story by Mr. Bat Jarvis. These two are  colossal, and, though they may fight each other, are immune from  attack at the hands of lesser gangs. But between the other gangs,  and especially between the Table Hill and the Three Points, which  are much of a size, warfare rages as briskly as among the republics  of South America. There has always been bad blood between the Table  Hill and the Three Points, and until they wipe each other out after  the manner of the Kilkenny cats, it is probable that there always  will be. Little events, trifling in themselves, have always  occurred to shatter friendly relations just when there has seemed a  chance of their being formed. Thus, just as the Table Hillites were  beginning to forgive the Three Points for shooting the redoubtable  Paul Horgan down at Coney Island, a Three Pointer injudiciously  wiped out another of the rival gang near Canal Street. He pleaded  self-defence, and in any case it was probably mere thoughtlessness,  but nevertheless the Table Hillites were ruffled.    That had been a month or so back. During that month things had been  simmering down, and peace was just preparing to brood when there  occurred the incident to which Pugsy had alluded, the regrettable  falling out of Dude Dawson and Spider Reilly at Mr. Maginnis's  dancing saloon, Shamrock Hall, the same which Bat Jarvis had been  called in to protect in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26076"],[0,"Birds from Coahuila, Mexico (#18)"],[1,"la.    _Wilsonia pusilla pileolata_ (Pallas).--_Specimens examined:_ total 3:  [Male] 31501 and [Female] 31500 from Sierra del Pino (=5 mi. S, 3 mi. W  Acebuches), May 13 and 14, 1954, measurements: wing, 59, 55 mm.; tail,  50, 49 mm.; culmen, 8, 8.5 mm.; tarsus, 16, 16 mm.; weight: 6, 7 gms.;  and [Male] 31663 from the north foot of Sierra Guadalupe (=10 mi. S, 5  mi. W General Cepeda), 6500 ft., April 21, 1953, measurements: wing, 58  mm.; tail, 46 mm.; culmen, 8.5 mm.; tarsus, 16 mm.; weight, 7 gms.    Wilson's Warbler is a common spring and probably fall migrant in  Coahuila. Miller (1955a:173) took spring migrants of _W. p. pileolata_  from April 9 to April 27; he found _W. p. pileolata_ at 4800 feet and  at 7000 feet. Amadon and Phillips (1947:579) saw a Wilson's Warbler at  Las Delicias on August 17. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:204) found  Wilson's Warbler to be the most abundant of the warblers that they  recorded in southeastern Coahuila. They saw _W. p. pileolata_ on the  top of the high ridges and in the arid desert country in the  southeastern section of the State. Several specimens were collected by  Burleigh and Lowery (_loc. cit._) including an immature male from the  Chorro del Agua on April 19. Dickerman saw Wilson's Warblers 16 mi. E  and 18 mi. N Ocampo on May 7, 1954, and at San Marcos (=20 mi. S Cuatro  Cienegas) on May 4, 1954. The sizes of our specimens as well as their  color (bright olive-green above, bright yellow below) are typical for  the subspecies _pileolata_.    _Setophaga ruticilla ruticilla_ (Linnaeus).--The American Redstart  seems to be uncommon in Coahuila. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  (1957:268) listed one specimen of _S. r. ruticilla_ from the State.    *_Setophaga picta picta_ Swainson.--_Specimens examined:_ total 2: sex  ? 31096 from 26 mi. W Santa Teresa, 7050 ft., April 5, 1952; and [Male]  31671 from Canyon d. Meco in Sierra Guadalupe (=10 mi. S General  Cepeda), April 23, 1953, weight, 11 gms.    The Painted Redstart seems to be locally common in Coahuila. Miller  (1955a:173) found these warblers breeding in the Sierra del Carmen and  said that they were \"common from 6000 to 7500 feet in canyon bottom  growth, in oaks, and in mixed pines and oaks;\" however, he did not see  any of these warblers above 7500 feet where conifers tended to dominate  the vegetation. Marsh and Stevenson (1938:287) obtained a male Painted  Redstart in annual molt on August 11 in oak and juniper forest at  Vivoras Spring in the Sierra del Carmen and reported seeing two other  Painted Redstarts at 9000 feet (see also Miller, 1955a:173). Dickerman  also saw seven Painted Redstarts 20 mi. S Ocampo on April 4, 1954. The  size of the testes (7x4 mm.) of No. 31671 suggests breeding by _S. p.  picta_ in the Sierra Guadalupe.    **_Passer domesticus domesticus_ (Linnaeus).--Burleigh and Lowery  (1942:204) remarked that the House Sparrow was not \"a common bird  around Saltillo\" although they noticed _P. d. domesticus_ regularly.  They reported House Sparrows also from the Chorro del Agua and in the  high mountain valley south of Diamante Pass. Miller, Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (1957:275) recorded _P. d. domesticus_ from Sabinas.  Baker captured House Sparrows in a bat net 12 mi. E San Antonio de las  Alazanas, 9950 feet, on July 5, 1955. Although there are no other  records, the House Sparrow is probably fairly common in the villages  and towns of the State.    [**_Sturnella magna hoopesi_ Stone.--The Eastern Meadowlark is uncommon  in Coahuila. The AOU Check-list Committee (1957:523) listed this  subspecies of the Eastern Meadowlark from northern Coahuila.]    **_Sturnella neglecta neglecta_ Audubon.--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Female] 31098, from the Rio Grande (=17 mi. S Dryden, Terrell Co.,  Texas, in Coahuila), 600 ft., March 18, 1952, weight, 71.8 gms.    This subspecies of the Western Meadowlark seems to be locally common in  the open country of Coahuila. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:205) found this  meadowlark common \"about Saltillo\" where a \"small series\" of _S.  neglecta_ was obtained. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  (1957:295) recorded the Western Meadowlark from El Diamante on July 7.  To my knowledge, no specific breeding records of this meadowlark from  Coahuila exist.    **_Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus_ (Bonaparte).--_Specimen examined:_  one, [Male] 32494 (skeleton only) from Las Margaritas, August 4, 1955.    The Yellow-headed Blackbird occurs in Coahuila in migration. Miller  (1955a:173) found this blackbird at Noria \"in the flats immediately  east of the Sierra del Carmen\" on April 28, and reported also that  Marsh took a male in worn breeding plumage on July 24 at Tanque de los  Melones on La Bavia Ranch east of Fresno Mesa. Amadon and Phillips  (1947:579) took two adult males at Las Delicias on August 11 and 15.  Dickerman also saw a female 8 mi. E and 2 mi. S Americanos on May 18,  1954. Van Hoose saw a male at Torreon on July 2, 1955.    *_Agelaius phoeniceus megapotamus_ Oberholser.--_Specimens examined:_  total 5: [Male] 32124, [Female] 32126, and [Female] 32128 from 12 mi.  N, 12 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 19, 1952; [Male] 32125 from 2 mi. W  Jimenez, 850 ft., June 20, 1952; and [Female] 32127 from 9 mi. S, 11  mi. E Sabinas, June 14, 1952.    This subspecies of the Redwinged Blackbird is common in eastern  Coahuila. There are no records of the species from western Coahuila.  Burleigh and Lowery (1942:205) obtained a male at \"the edge of  Saltillo\" on April 24. Oberholser (1919a:23) recorded _A. p.  megapotamus_ from Porfirio Diaz on June 2, 5, and 6. The presence of  juveniles (32126, 32128) from 12 mi. N and 12 mi. W Jimenez and (32125)  from 2 mi. W Jimenez, respectively, and the dates (June 14, 19, 20) on  which the University of Kansas specimens were obtained are evidence of  breeding by _A. p. megapotamus_ in northeastern Coahuila.    *_Icterus spurius_ (Linnaeus).--_Specimens examined:_ total 8: [Male]  [Male] 31536-31537 from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 19,  1952; [Male] 31538 from 2 mi. S, 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas, 1160 ft.,  June 23, 1952; [Male] [Male] 32605-32607 from Parras, July 4, 1955;  [Male] 32604 and [Female] 32603 from Hacienda San Lorenzo, July 3,  1955, weights, 19.4, 18.5 gms.    The Orchard Oriole seems to occur fairly commonly in eastern and  southern Coahuila and breeds in the State. Amadon and Phillips  (1947:579) reported that Orchard Orioles were common in the desert  \"about Las Delicias\" in August and September and probably were  migrants. Dickerman collected Nos. 32605-32606 along an irrigated  field-edge that consisted of cottonwood and oak; he obtained Nos.  32603-32604 in an irrigated pecan orchard. The sizes of the testes  (10x5 mm.; 10x5 mm.; 8x7 mm.; 8x7 mm.; 10x8 mm.) of Nos. 31536, 31537,  32605, and 32604, respectively, and the size of the largest ovum (2  mm.) of No. 32603 as well as the dates (June 19, 23; July 3, 4) on  which all these specimens were collected indicate breeding by this  species in the State.    *_Icterus cucullatus cucullatus_ Swainson.--_Specimens examined:_ total  2: [Male] 32123 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 21, 1952; and  [Male] 32122 from 2 mi. S, 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas, 1160 ft., June  23, 1952.    The Hooded Oriole apparently is uncommon in Coahuila. Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:290) listed _I. c. cucullatus_ from  Sabinas. The size of the testes (11x6 mm.) of No. 32122 and the dates  (June 21, 23) on which Nos. 32123 and 32122 were collected as well as  the juvenile male (tail, 80.5 mm.) from 2 mi. W Jimenez suggest  breeding by this subspecies in Coahuila.    *_Icterus parisorum_ Bonaparte.--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Female]  32121, from 7 mi. S, 4 mi. E Bella Union, 7200 ft., June 25, 1952.    Scott's Oriole is common in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:173) found this  oriole breeding in the canyons at the base of the Sierra del Carmen.  Burleigh and Lowery (1942:205) found this oriole limited to the higher  altitudes above 7000 feet, and took specimens at Diamante Pass and at  the Chorro del Agua on April 19. Amadon and Phillips (1947:579) found  Scott's Oriole \"not uncommon in the arroyos near Las Delicias\" and  reported a juvenile \"barely out of the nest and able to fly only a few  feet ...\" on August 15. No. 32121 had an egg in its oviduct. Dickerman  saw Scott's Orioles in the Sierra del Pino on May 12, 1954, and 16 mi.  E and 18 mi. N Ocampo on May 7, 1954.    **_Icterus wagleri wagleri_ Sclater.--Ridgway (1902:268) recorded  _Icterus wagleri_ from Saltillo. Hellmayr (1937:122-123) referred this  record of Wagler's Oriole to _I. w. wagleri_.    *_Icterus bullockii bullockii_ (Swainson).--This subspecies of  Bullock's Oriole was listed as breeding by Miller, Friedmann, Griscom,  and Moore (1957:282) at Monclova on May 12-19.    _Euphagus cyanocephalus_ (Wagler).--Brewer's Blackbird is a common  migrant in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:174) found a few as migrants in the  Sierra del Carmen on April 27. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:205) remarked  that \"this blackbird was characteristically a bird of the towns and  villages, the scattered flocks being invariably seen feeding in the  streets and near the houses.\" They (_loc. cit._) obtained three  specimens at Diamante Valley on April 23 and remarked that the  departure of these birds in spring was \"extremely late.\"    _*Cassidix mexicanus prosopidicola_ Lowery.--_Specimens examined:_  total 3: [Female] 32893 from Parras, July 4, 1955, weight, 98.8 gms.;  and [Male] [Male] 35418-35419 from Torreon, January 8, 1954.    This subspecies of Boat-tailed Grackle has been recorded from several  localities in Coahuila. In southeastern Coahuila, Burleigh and Lowery  (1942:205-206) noted this grackle \"somewhat local in its distribution;  it was found in cultivated fields about the towns and villages.\" These  authors noted it at Saltillo, the Chorro del Agua, and \"occasionally in  the open valley south of Diamante"]]]
