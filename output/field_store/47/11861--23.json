To repair  them Lieut. Scouler and his linemen, under Corporal Curran, made many  journeys across the exposed portion of the slopes of the ravines. Flag  signalling was unnecessary, but a lamp was mounted and sighted so that  in case of a sudden attack after dark support could be immediately  summoned.    Beyond the actual trenches there was little cover for the garrison. A  few excavations in the earth--designated \"dugouts\"--roofed with  waterproof sheets, afforded moderate protection against the weather, but  none against shrapnel, splinter, or bomb. The C.O. was the possessor of  quarters boasting a covering of two sheets of corrugated iron which had  a thin layer of earth on top. This, however, demonstrated its degree of  usefulness by falling in upon its occupant. Later on excavations were  made in the walls of the communication trenches--each to afford a  \"comfortable\" sleeping place for two or more men.    To assist the newcomers it had been arranged to leave in the trenches a  few officers and men of the New Zealanders. Major W. W. Alderman was  attached as Staff Officer to the Commanding Officer. A N.Z. Field  Company of Engineers had charge of the works in the area, and for the  first week the N.Z. Infantry manned the machine guns. The help thus  rendered was invaluable to the inexperienced, and a strong feeling of  mutual regard sprang up between the members of the two Dominions. The  majority of the New Zealanders thus remaining were Maoris--a body of men  of fine physique, who had demonstrated their capacity to endure and also  proved their worth as keen and sterling fighters. The Maoris had their  own chaplain and medical officer. The latter (Dr. M. P. Buck) later  commanded the N.Z. Pioneer Battalion.    The attitude of the opposing armies at this time was not altogether  passive. A war of attrition was carried on continuously. This took the  form of daily bombardments by the artillery of positions and areas  behind the trenches; also the raking of parapets of opposing trenches,  and No Man's Land, by machine gun fire at night. Sniping with the rifle  had become a fine art, and authenticated cases, wherein a Turk had been  knocked over, were mentioned in Orders. One Light Horseman, it was  recorded in Corps Orders, had over 200 of the enemy to his credit. This  sniping was done from carefully concealed positions (possies), from  steel loopholes built into the parapet, or by means of the periscope  rifle which latter enabled the user to fire over the sandbags without  any exposure of his own body.    Sniping with field guns was also indulged in. In this the enemy had the  advantage by reason of being on higher ground and able to overlook most  of the Australian sector. Working parties, parties in movement, and  individuals who came under observation, were usually treated to a dose  of shrapnel fired with excellent aim and timing from 77 millimeter guns  of high velocity. The projectile from this gun was usually designated a  \"whizz-bang\" on account of the short space of time which elapsed between  the first sound of its approach and that of the explosion of the shell.  By some grim humourist it was said that if one could hear the shell  coming there was no danger to be feared, but if, on the other hand, the  sound was not audible, then there was no need to worry. The burial  parties would do all that was necessary.    In fighting between trench and trench, considerable use was made,  besides the rifle, of bombs or grenades. These were of varied types,  with either concussion or missile effect, and some were thrown by hand  whilst others were propelled from mortars or catapults. The Mills  grenade had just made its appearance, and was regarded as a special  reserve of power in case of an enemy attack. The numbers of these  available were small but other types were more plentiful and included  the jam tin, cricket ball, time and friction, match head, and hair  brush. Some were ignited by mechanical action and others by match or  portfire. Portfires were made by wrapping a piece of khaki drill tightly  around a thin strip of pine wood. One of these when once lit would burn  for hours.    Of Trench Mortars the Apex position possessed two--one a 3.7 inch and  the other, smaller, a Garland Howitzer. These threw light bombs a short  distance. Their effect was quite local and, except in case of a direct  hit on a person, hardly more than moral. One of these mortars was  located on either flank of the position. Private F. Congdon was placed  in charge of that on the right and Private J. B. Deering that on the  left. These soldiers soon learned to use their weapons so effectively  that the Turk was discovered, early one morning, to have placed a  protective wire-netting screen in front of and over the Blockhouse.    Later on the Battalion made the acquaintance of the Catapult. This  machine resembled a large \"shanghai\" fixed to timber, one end of which  rested on the parapet whilst the other--in the trench--was packed in a  manner to give the required elevation. A cricket ball or jam tin bomb  was placed in the pouch and the rubbers were then strained by means of a  crank handle winding up a wire attached to the pouch with a trip hook.  When the required tension was obtained one man lit the fuse and retired  to cover. The other, the expert, allowing the fuse to burn for a certain  time--to suit the range, pulled the string which released the trip. If  all went well the bomb sailed over towards the Turk. Sometimes, however,  the trip would fail, or the rubbers foul. Then the bomb would make a  very short flight and might not even clear the home trench. In  consequence of these possibilities, the local area was never overcrowded  with inquisitive people and the experts became expert also at taking  cover.    [Illustration: AT THE APEX.  Using the Periscope Rifle.  _Photo. lent by Mrs. H. Simm._]    [Illustration: \"THE FARM.\"  Taken from No. 4 Post at the Apex.  _Photo. lent by Mrs. H. Simm._]    In some parts of the line bombing was carried on from \"bombing bays.\"  These bays were small earthworks constructed, usually, in advance but  connected with the main trench. Two men were placed in occupation of  each. One man was an experienced thrower and the other, as the Turk had  the unpleasant habit of retaliating, held a half-filled sandbag which he  dropped upon any enemy bomb which happened to land within the bay. With  low power grenades this method was effective but failed when applied to  such as were invented by Mills.    Two other types of weapons may be mentioned here. One used by us and the  other by the enemy. The first was a Japanese mortar which fired a 50 lb.  bomb having a good range and a large bursting charge. This had been used  by our ally during the Russo-Japanese War. The Battalion made its  acquaintance when the move to Russell's Top took place, in December, but  unfortunately the ammunition was too scarce to permit of any lasting  benefit being derived, although the few rounds that were fired proved  their destructive effect on the opposing trenches. The Turkish weapon  was known as the \"broomstick bomb\" and was also propelled from a mortar.  It consisted of a 4-inch cartridge case filled with a high explosive and  also containing metal such as boiler punchings, nails, etc. (in one case  gramophone needles were discovered), and provided with a percussion cap.  It was fitted to a stick about two inches thick and five feet long. Its  descent into our lines or support area was almost vertical--hence no  cover then available was proof against it. Its effect was very  destructive and its toll of life heavy. A sentry usually watched for and  gave warning of the approach of one of these missiles, and the scene  which followed his stentorian \"Look out!\" was somewhat animated.  Hairbreadth escapes from destruction were numerous. Two of these will  bear relation.    A batman, preparing an evening meal, was interrupted by the arrival of a  bomb which had glanced off some obstacle and now came to a halt across  the cooking fire. The batman hurriedly evacuated his position but,  fortunately, the uninvited guest did not explode and was carefully  removed out of harm's way by the adjutant. The very next morning a  second missile came to rest on the waterproof sheet furnishing cover for  this same man. This was more than he could bear--\"it was over the  odds\"--and he complained. Some difficulty was experienced in restoring  to him the correct viewpoint in regard to such occurrences.    The second incident was an experience of Lieut. G. A. F. Smith, who,  whilst sitting in a newly constructed \"safe\" dugout, and enjoying a  meal, was startled by a sudden clatter and almost blinded by an upheaval  of earth and dust. Clearing his eyes he discovered the ruined remains of  his repast, and, lying between his legs, an unexploded broomstick bomb  that had glanced off the opposite wall of the communication trench and  slid into the excavation. Somebody in the Battalion tacked a story on  to this occurrence. It was said that this officer's batman, having  observed the arrival of the bomb, approached the dugout and, peering  cautiously into it, was greeted with \"Hallo! What shall I do with this?\"  His reply was: \"If you will wait until I get around the corner, you can  do as you ---- well like with it.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [G] Burnu = cape.    [H] Tepe = hill.

Geometry, like Arithmetic, has been subsumed, in recent times, under  the general study of order. It was formerly supposed that Geometry was  the study of the nature of the space in which we live, and accordingly  it was urged, by those who held that what exists can only be known  empirically, that Geometry should really be regarded as belonging to  applied mathematics. But it has gradually appeared, by the increase of  non-Euclidean systems, that Geometry throws no more light upon the  nature of space than Arithmetic throws upon the population of the  United States. Geometry is a whole collection of deductive sciences  based on a corresponding collection of sets of axioms. One set of  axioms is Euclid's; other equally good sets of axioms lead to other  results. Whether Euclid's axioms are true, is a question as to which  the pure mathematician is indifferent; and, what is more, it is a  question which it is theoretically impossible to answer with certainty  in the affirmative. It might possibly be shown, by very careful  measurements, that Euclid's axioms are false; but no measurements  could ever assure us (owing to the errors of observation) that they  are exactly true. Thus the geometer leaves to the man of science to  decide, as best he may, what axioms are most nearly true in the actual  world. The geometer takes any set of axioms that seem interesting, and  deduces their consequences. What defines Geometry, in this sense, is  that the axioms must give rise to a series of more than one dimension.  And it is thus that Geometry becomes a department in the study of  order.    In Geometry, as in other parts of mathematics, Peano and his disciples  have done work of the very greatest merit as regards principles.  Formerly, it was held by philosophers and mathematicians alike that  the proofs in Geometry depended on the figure; nowadays, this is known  to be false. In the best books there are no figures at all. The  reasoning proceeds by the strict rules of formal logic from a set of  axioms laid down to begin with. If a figure is used, all sorts of  things seem obviously to follow, which no formal reasoning can prove  from the explicit axioms, and which, as a matter of fact, are only  accepted because they are obvious. By banishing the figure, it becomes  possible to discover _all_ the axioms that are needed; and in this way  all sorts of possibilities, which would have otherwise remained  undetected, are brought to light.    One great advance, from the point of view of correctness, has been  made by introducing points as they are required, and not starting, as  was formerly done, by assuming the whole of space. This method is due  partly to Peano, partly to another Italian named Fano. To those  unaccustomed to it, it has an air of somewhat wilful pedantry. In this  way, we begin with the following axioms: (1) There is a class of  entities called _points_. (2) There is at least one point. (3) If _a_  be a point, there is at least one other point besides _a_. Then we  bring in the straight line joining two points, and begin again with  (4), namely, on the straight line joining _a_ and _b_, there is at  least one other point besides _a_ and _b_. (5) There is at least one  point not on the line _ab_. And so we go on, till we have the means of  obtaining as many points as we require. But the word _space_, as Peano  humorously remarks, is one for which Geometry has no use at all.    The rigid methods employed by modern geometers have deposed Euclid  from his pinnacle of correctness. It was thought, until recent times,  that, as Sir Henry Savile remarked in 1621, there were only two  blemishes in Euclid, the theory of parallels and the theory of  proportion. It is now known that these are almost the only points in  which Euclid is free from blemish. Countless errors are involved in  his first eight propositions. That is to say, not only is it doubtful  whether his axioms are true, which is a comparatively trivial matter,  but it is certain that his propositions do not follow from the axioms  which he enunciates. A vastly greater number of axioms, which Euclid  unconsciously employs, are required for the proof of his propositions.  Even in the first proposition of all, where he constructs an  equilateral triangle on a given base, he uses two circles which are  assumed to intersect. But no explicit axiom assures us that they do  so, and in some kinds of spaces they do not always intersect. It is  quite doubtful whether our space belongs to one of these kinds or not.  Thus Euclid fails entirely to prove his point in the very first  proposition. As he is certainly not an easy author, and is terribly  long-winded, he has no longer any but an historical interest. Under  these circumstances, it is nothing less than a scandal that he should  still be taught to boys in England.[17] A book should have either  intelligibility or correctness; to combine the two is impossible, but  to lack both is to be unworthy of such a place as Euclid has occupied  in education.    The most remarkable result of modern methods in mathematics is the  importance of symbolic logic and of rigid formalism. Mathematicians,  under the influence of Weierstrass, have shown in modern times a care  for accuracy, and an aversion to slipshod reasoning, such as had not  been known among them previously since the time of the Greeks. The  great inventions of the seventeenth century--Analytical Geometry and  the Infinitesimal Calculus--were so fruitful in new results that  mathematicians had neither time nor inclination to examine their  foundations. Philosophers, who should have taken up the task, had too  little mathematical ability to invent the new branches of mathematics  which have now been found necessary for any adequate discussion. Thus  mathematicians were only awakened from their \"dogmatic slumbers\" when  Weierstrass and his followers showed that many of their most cherished  propositions are in general false. Macaulay, contrasting the certainty  of mathematics with the uncertainty of philosophy, asks who ever heard  of a reaction against Taylor's theorem? If he had lived now, he  himself might have heard of such a reaction, for this is precisely one  of the theorems which modern investigations have overthrown. Such rude  shocks to mathematical faith have produced that love of formalism  which appears, to those who are ignorant of its motive, to be mere  outrageous pedantry.    The proof that all pure mathematics, including Geometry, is nothing  but formal logic, is a fatal blow to the Kantian philosophy. Kant,  rightly perceiving that Euclid's propositions could not be deduced  from Euclid's axioms without the help of the figures, invented a  theory of knowledge to account for this fact; and it accounted so  successfully that, when the fact is shown to be a mere defect in  Euclid, and not a result of the nature of geometrical reasoning,  Kant's theory also has to be abandoned. The whole doctrine of _a  priori_ intuitions, by which Kant explained the possibility of pure  mathematics, is wholly inapplicable to mathematics in its present  form. The Aristotelian doctrines of the schoolmen come nearer in  spirit to the doctrines which modern mathematics inspire; but the  schoolmen were hampered by the fact that their formal logic was very  defective, and that the philosophical logic based upon the syllogism  showed a corresponding narrowness. What is now required is to give the  greatest possible development to mathematical logic, to allow to the  full the importance of relations, and then to found upon this secure  basis a new philosophical logic, which may hope to borrow some of the  exactitude and certainty of its mathematical foundation. If this can  be successfully accomplished, there is every reason to hope that the  near future will be as great an epoch in pure philosophy as the  immediate past has been in the principles of mathematics. Great  triumphs inspire great hopes; and pure thought may achieve, within our  generation, such results as will place our time, in this respect, on a  level with the greatest age of Greece.[18]    FOOTNOTES:    [11] This subject is due in the main to Mr. C.S.
