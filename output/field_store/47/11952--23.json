As for Schumann, he was very happy in  the use of this form, and his _Symphonic Etudes_, op. 13--in wealth of  fancy and freedom of treatment--are quite unparalleled. His Variations  for two pianofortes, op. 46, deserve also to be known. Among the  finest examples since Beethoven are the numerous sets by Brahms,  remarkable alike for emotional power, for free and yet logical  treatment of the material and for solidity of workmanship. They  include the _Variations on a theme from Handel_ for pianoforte, op.  24; the set for orchestra, op. 56a, on the _St. Anthony Choral_ of  Haydn; and the two sets, op. 35, on themes from Paganini--universally  conceded to be the most brilliant examples for the pianoforte in  recent literature.    To speak now particularly of the modern school, there are five  compositions in this form which, for their daring novelty and  sustained eloquence, should be familiar to every music-lover and heard  as often as possible. For they are elaborate works which must be  thoroughly known to be understood and loved. (1), There is the set in  Tchaikowsky's Pianoforte Trio in A minor, op. 50; noteworthy for  freedom of modulation and for the striking individuality given to the  different transformations of the theme--two of the changes being to a  Waltz and a Mazurka. (2), _The Symphonic Variations_ for Pianoforte  and Orchestra of Cesar Franck, based on two contrasting themes, one in  the minor mode and one with modulations to the major. The variations  are not numbered and there are no rigid stops; throughout the work  Franck's marvellous power of modulation and rich harmonic texture are  eloquently manifested. (3), The _Istar_ Variations for orchestra by  d'Indy is one of the most original works in the whole field; in that,  for dramatic reasons connected with the subject, the usual order is  _reversed_ and the variations come _first_, gradually becoming more  and more simple until we reach the theme itself, pure and unadorned.  (4), The Symphonic Poem, _Don Quixote_, of R. Strauss, a complex set  of Variations on _three_ themes which typify respectively the  characters of Cervantes' story; the Knight, his attendant, Sancho  Panza and Dulcinea. The variations are not confined to a merely  abstract or formal treatment of the material but set before us a  picture of the attributes of the characters and a description of some  of their spectacular adventures. (5), Lastly the _Enigma Variations_  for orchestra by Elgar, so-called because the identity of the basic  theme is not revealed. The variations are character-pieces which for  individuality and charm are a lasting glory to the genius of the  composer.[84]    [Footnote 84: For a detailed account see the third volume of D.G.  Mason's _Appreciation of Music_ series.]    We shall now analyze, with suggestive comments, two[85] of the  well-known sets of Beethoven: the first movement of the Sonata, op.  26, and the _Six Variations on an original theme_, op. 34. The  variations from the Sonata are an early work; but, although definitely  sectionalized and with only one change of tonality, they clearly  reveal Beethoven's freedom of conception and his aversion to  stereotyped treatment. The theme itself is a suave, appealing melody,  already cited as an example of a sixteen-measure sentence, and  admirably suited for variation purposes, since it arouses at once the  expectation of the listener.[86] The first variation is a kind of  shadowy, mysterious outline of the theme just presented, as if the  composer were musing upon the latent possibilities of his material.  There is a quickening of interest in the second variation which, with  the theme in the bass, may be likened to a 'cello solo of a mildly  bravura nature. (Note the fantastic accents on weak beats in measures  18, 22, 23, and 24.) In the third variation comes a complete contrast  in mood; the key is changed to A-flat minor and the theme is  transformed into an elegy, all its joy crushed out. The movement  abounds in impassioned dissonances, always emphasized by _sf_ marks,  and the throbbing pulsations of the bass--in the second phrase--give a  tragic intensity of feeling. With the fourth variation there enters  that spirit of playfulness so characteristic of Beethoven--the  movement being, in fact, a miniature Scherzo. The fifth and last  variation is an idyllic revery in which the composer reviews and  amplifies the many beautiful fancies which his imagination has  conceived, and closes with a coda, based on the motive of the main  theme, of tranquillity and satisfaction.    [Footnote 85: These compositions are not printed in the Supplement, as  it may be assumed that the student can readily procure them. They are  published in a number of editions.]    [Footnote 86: For some illuminating comments on the whole Sonata see  Baxter Perry's _Descriptive Analysis of Pianoforte Works_. (The  Theodore Presser Co.)]    The set in F major, op. 34, is a striking illustration of Beethoven's  fondness for mediant relationship, since no two variations are in the  same key; the tonic of each being a _third_ below that of the  preceding. The Key-scheme is F, D, B-flat, G, E-flat, C minor; and  then, through the descent of a fifth, back to the home-key, or in  actual notes:    [Music]    The first variation is a highly embellished treatment of the opening  theme; the melodic outline being merely hinted at in unimportant parts  of the phraseology, _e.g._    [Music: original theme]    [Music: 1st Variation]    Written in the old ornate style, it is of interest chiefly for the  pianistic effect. In the second Variation we have a change both of  time and key; the impression being that of a distant march for men's  voices or for soft trombones. The third Variation, again with change  of time and key, illustrates Beethoven's fondness for a subtle  outlining of the theme. In the fourth Variation the theme is  transformed into a Minuet of graceful swing; and in the next Variation  a strong contrast is afforded by the Funeral March, the minor mode  being used for the first time. The last Variation--in the  home-key--gives a brilliant summing up of the characteristic features  of the theme. Note especially the reminiscent effect of the closing  measures.          CHAPTER IX    THE SONATA-FORM AND ITS FOUNDERS, EMMANUEL BACH AND HAYDN      We have now set forth, with representative illustrations, all the  fundamental forms of instrumental music, _i.e._, the Canon, Fugue and  Invention, the Two and Three-part forms, the Rondo and the Varied Air.  Through the perfecting of these means of expression music became a  living language of communication, ready for that development which,  through the genius of the Classic and Romantic masters, it was  destined to show. The essential feature of all the above forms is the  emphasis laid on _one theme_. This is strictly true of the polyphonic  forms, the Canon, Fugue[87] and Invention and of the Two-part form;  and although in the Three-part form we have a second theme, this is  merely for contrast and is often of rather slight import. The same  comment holds true of the Rondo where, notwithstanding the new  contrasting themes of the episodes, the centre of attraction is the  _single main theme_, to which constant recurrence is made. Obviously  the Varied Air is the expansion of a single theme. But the principal  characteristic of the Sonata-Form, now to be studied, is that we find  therein _two themes_ of coequal importance, which may well be compared  to the hero and heroine of a novel or the two leading characters in a  drama. It is true that a composer will often in the creations of his  imagination show a marked preference for one theme over the other;  just as, in the family group to which the child owes its life, either  the man or the woman is likely to be the stronger character. But as  there can be no child without two parents, so the organism of the  Sonata-Form derives its vitality from the presence and interaction of  two living musical personalities, the first and second themes. The  first theme is so called because it is the one first presented and  because it generally furnishes the prevailing rhythmic pulse of the  movement. Yet the second theme,--exactly as important in its own way,  is often of a greater beauty; its title of \"second theme\" implying  nothing of a secondary nature, but merely its position in order of  appearance. No greater step was ever taken in the growth of musical  structure than this introduction of a second coequal theme; for the  principle of duality, of action and reaction between two forces, runs  throughout nature both human and physical, as is seen from the import  of the terms: man and woman, active and passive, positive and  negative, heat and cold, light and darkness. The first theme, in fact,  often resembles, in its vigor and directness, a masculine personality;  while the second theme, in grace and tenderness, resembles the  feminine. As long as music confined itself to the presentation of but  one main theme it was hampered by the same limitations which beset the  early Greek tragedians, in whose primitive plays[88] we find but one  chief actor. The introduction of a second theme can not be attributed  to _any single man_; indeed it resulted from a tendency of the times,  the demand of which was for more homophonic melodies rather than for  an elaborate polyphonic treatment of a single one. Embryonic traces of  a second theme we find in D. Scarlatti (see Supplement No. 40) and in  Sebastian Bach himself.[89] Scarlatti,[90] in fact, was often hovering  close to the Sonata-Form and in the example just cited actually  achieved it. The systematic employment of the second-theme principle,  however, is commonly attributed to Emmanuel Bach (1714-1788),"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30576"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#18)"],[1,"dies 'bout seven years after freedom and everybody sorry  den.

Boyd remained with his master for four years after       emancipation, then moved to Harrison County, where he now lives.       His memory is poor, but he managed to recall a few incidents.      \"I was fifteen years when they says we're free. That's the age my Old  Missy done give me when the war stopped. She had all us niggers' ages in  a book, and told me I was born near Henderson. My Old Marse was Wash  Trammel and he brunged me and my mama and papa from Alabama. Mama was  named Juliet and papa, Amos. Marse Trammel owned my grandpa and grandma,  too, and they was named Jeanette and Josh.    \"The plantation was two made into one, and plenty big, and more'n a  hundred slaves to work it. Marse lived in a hewed log house,  weather-boarded out and in, and the quarters was good, log houses with  bed railin's hewed out of logs. We raised everything we et, 'cept sugar,  and Marse bought that in big hogsheads. We got our week's rations every  Sunday, and when we went to eat, everybody's part was put out to them on  a tin plate.    \"Marse Trammel give a big cornshucking every fall. He had two bottom  fields in corn. First we'd gather peas and cushaws and pumpkins out the  corn field, then get the corn and pile it front the cribs. They was two  big cribs for the corn we kep' to use and five big cribs for sale corn.  My uncle stayed round the sale corn cribs all spring, till ginnin' time,  'cause folks come for miles after corn. Marse had five wheat cribs and  one rye crib. We went ten mile to Tatum to git our meal and flour  ground.    \"The patterrollers darsn't come 'bout our place or bother us niggers.  Marse Wash allus say, 'I'll patterroller my own place.' Marse was good  to us and only once a overseer beat a woman up a trifle, and Marse  Trammel fired him that same day.    \"The sojers 'fiscated lots of corn from Marse and some more owners in  Rusk County piled corn up in a big heap and made me go mind it till the  rest the sojers got there. I was settin' top that corn pile, me and my  big bulldog, and the General rode up. My dog growled and I made him  hush. The General man say to me, 'Boy, you is 'scused now, go on home.'  I got to a fence and looked back, and that General was hewin' him a hoss  trough out a log. The sojers come in droves and set up they camp. I sot  on a stump and watched them pass. They stayed three, four days till the  corn was all fed up.    \"While they's camped there they'd cotch chickens. They had a fishin'  pole and line and hook. They'd put a grain of corn on the hook and ride  on they hoss and pitch the hook out 'mong the chickens. When a chicken  swallowed the corn they'd jerk up the line with that chicken and ride  off.    \"Marse had six hundred bales cotton in the Shreveport warehouse when war  was over. He got word them Yankees done take it on a boat. He got his  brother to take him to Shreveport and say, 'I'll follow that cotton to  Hell and back.' He followed his cotton to Alabama and got it back, but  he died and was buried there in Alabama 'fore Old Missy knowed it.    \"I stayed with her four years after surrender and then went to farmin'  with my folks, for $10.00 a month. After a year or two I went to  railroadin', helping cut the right-of-way for the T.& P. Railroad, from  Marshall to Longview. They paid us $1.50 the day and three drinks of  whiskey a day.    \"I marries four times but had only one child, but I never done nothin'  'citin'.
