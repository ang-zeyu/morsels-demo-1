As he was therefore purifying his followers, he lighted upon  the gods of Laban; [for he did not before know they were stolen by  Rachel;] and he hid them in the earth, under an oak, in Shechem. And  departing thence, he offered sacrifice at Bethel, the place where he saw  his dream, when he went first into Mesopotamia.    3. And when he was gone thence, and was come over against Ephrata, he  there buried Rachel, who died in child-bed: she was the only one of  Jacob's kindred that had not the honor of burial at Hebron. And when he  had mourned for her a great while, he called the son that was born of  her Benjamin, 39 because of the sorrow the mother had with him. These  are all the children of Jacob, twelve males and one female.--Of them  eight were legitimate,--viz. six of Lea, and two of Rachel; and four  were of the handmaids, two of each; all whose names have been set down  already.              CHAPTER 22. How Isaac Died, And Was Buried In Hebron.    From thence Jacob came to Hebron, a city situate among the Canaanites;  and there it was that Isaac lived: and so they lived together for a  little while; for as to Rebeka, Jacob did not find her alive. Isaac also  died not long after the coming of his son; and was buried by his sons,  with his wife, in Hebron, where they had a monument belonging to them  from their forefathers. Now Isaac was a man who was beloved of God, and  was vouchsafed great instances of providence by God, after Abraham his  father, and lived to be exceeding old; for when he had lived virtuously  one hundred and eighty-five years, he then died.              FOOTNOTES:      1 (return) [ Since Josephus, in his Preface, sect. 4, says that Moses  wrote some things enigmatically, some allegorically, and the rest in  plain words, since in his account of the first chapter of Genesis, and  the first three verses of the second, he gives us no hints of any  mystery at all; but when he here comes to ver. 4, etc., he says that  Moses, after the seventh day was over, began to talk philosophically; it  is not very improbable that he understood the rest of the second and the  third chapters in some enigmatical, or allegorical, or philosophical  sense. The change of the name of God just at this place, from Elohim to  Jehovah Elohim, from God to Lord God, in the Hebrew, Samaritan, and  Septuagint, does also not a little favor some such change in the  narration or construction.]      2 (return) [ We may observe here, that Josephus supposed man to be  compounded of spirit, soul, and body, with St. Paul, 1 Thessalonians  5:23, and the rest of the ancients: he elsewhere says also, that the  blood of animals was forbidden to be eaten, as having in it soul and  spirit, Antiq. B. III. ch. 11. sect. 2.]      3 (return) [ Whence this strange notion came, which yet is not peculiar  to Joseph, but, as Dr. Hudson says here, is derived from older authors,  as if four of the greatest rivers in the world, running two of them at  vast distances from the other two, by some means or other watered  paradise, is hard to say. Only since Josephus has already appeared to  allegorize this history, and take notice that these four names had a  particular signification; Phison for Ganges, a multitude; Phrath for  Euphrates, either a dispersion or a flower; Diglath for Tigris, what is  swift, with narrowness; and Geon for Nile, what arises from the east,Â—we  perhaps mistake him when we suppose he literally means those four  rivers; especially as to Geon or Nile, which arises from the east, while  he very well knew the literal Nile arises from the south; though what  further allegorical sense he had in view, is now, I fear, impossible to  be determined.]      4 (return) [ By the Red Sea is not here meant the Arabian Gulf, which  alone we now call by that name, but all that South Sea, which included  the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf, as far as the East Indies; as Reland  and Hudson here truly note, from the old geographers.]      5 (return) [ Hence it appears, that Josephus thought several, at least,  of the brute animals, particularly the serpent, could speak before the  fall. And I think few of the more perfect kinds of those animals want  the organs of speech at this day. Many inducements there are also to a  notion, that the present state they are in, is not their original state;  and that their capacities have been once much greater than we now see  them, and are capable of being restored to their former condition. But  as to this most ancient, and authentic, and probably allegorical account  of that grand affair of the fall of our first parents, I have somewhat  more to say in way of conjecture, but being only a conjecture, I omit  it: only thus far, that the imputation of the sin of our first parents  to their posterity, any further than as some way the cause or occasion  of man's mortality, seems almost entirely groundless; and that both man,  and the other subordinate creatures, are hereafter to be delivered from  the curse then brought upon them, and at last to be delivered from that  bondage of corruption, Romans 8:19-22.]      6 (return) [ St. John's account of the reason why God accepted the  sacrifice of Abel, and rejected that of Cain; as also why Cain slew  Abel, on account of that his acceptance with God, is much better than  this of Josephus: I mean, because \"Cain was of the evil one, and slew  his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil,  and his brother's righteous,\" 1 John 3:12. Josephus's reason seems to be  no better than a pharisaical notion or tradition.]      7 (return) [ From this Jubal, not improbably, came Jobel, the trumpet of  jobel or jubilee; that large and loud musical instrument, used in  proclaiming the liberty at the year of jubilee.]      8 (return) [ The number of Adam's children, as says the old tradition  was thirty-three sons, and twenty-three daughters.]      9 (return) [ What is here said of Seth and his posterity, that they were  very good and virtuous, and at the same time very happy, without any  considerable misfortunes, for seven generations, [see ch. 2. sect. 1,  before; and ch. 3. sect. 1, hereafter,] is exactly agreeable to the  state of the world and the conduct of Providence in all the first ages.]      10 (return) [ Of Josephus's mistake here, when he took Seth the son of  Adam, for Seth or Sesostris, king of Egypt, the erector of this pillar  in the land of Siriad, see Essay on the Old Testament, Appendix, p. 159,  160. Although the main of this relation might be true, and Adam might  foretell a conflagration and a deluge, which all antiquity witnesses to  be an ancient tradition; nay, Seth's posterity might engrave their  inventions in astronomy on two such pillars; yet it is no way credible  that they could survive the deluge, which has buried all such pillars  and edifices far under ground in the sediment of its waters, especially  since the like pillars of the Egyptian Seth or Sesostris were extant  after the flood, in the land of Siriad, and perhaps in the days of  Josephus also, as is shown in the place here referred to.]      11 (return) [ This notion, that the fallen angels were, in some sense,  the fathers of the old giants, was the constant opinion of antiquity.]      12 (return) [ Josephus here supposes that the life of these giants, for  of them only do I understand him, was now reduced to 120 years; which is  confirmed by the fragment of Enoch, sect. 10, in Authent. Rec. Part I.  p. 268. For as to the rest of mankind, Josephus himself confesses their  lives were much longer than 120 years, for many generations after the  flood, as we shall see presently; and he says they were gradually  shortened till the days of Moses, and then fixed [for some time] at 120,  ch. 6. sect. 5. Nor indeed need we suppose that either Enoch or Josephus  meant to interpret these 120 years for the life of men before the flood,  to be different from the 120 years of God's patience [perhaps while the  ark was preparing] till the deluge; which I take to be the meaning of  God when he threatened this wicked world, that if they so long continued  impenitent, their days should be no more than 120 years.]      13 (return) [ A cubit is about 21 English inches.]      14 (return) [ Josephus here truly determines, that the year at the Flood  began about the autumnal equinox. As to what day of the month the Flood  began, our Hebrew and Samaritan, and perhaps Josephus's own copy, more  rightly placed it on the 17th day, instead of the 27th, as here; for  Josephus agrees with them, as to the distance of 150 days to the 17th  day of the 7th month, as Genesis 7. ult. with 8:3.]      15 (return) [ Josephus here takes notice, that these ancient genealogies  were first set down by those that then lived, and from them were  transmitted down to posterity; which I suppose to be the true account of  that matter. For there is no reason to imagine that men were not taught  to read and write soon after they were taught to speak; and perhaps all  by the Messiah himself, who, under the Father, was the Creator or  Governor of mankind, and who frequently in those early days appeared to  them.]      16 (return) [ This [GREEK], or Place of Descent, is the proper rendering  of the Armenian name of this very city.

For I suppose it will thence become evident,  that the laws we have given us are disposed after the best manner for  the advancement of piety, for mutual communion with one another, for a  general love of mankind, as also for justice, and for sustaining labors  with fortitude, and for a contempt of death. And I beg of those that  shall peruse this writing of mine, to read it without partiality; for  it is not my purpose to write an encomium upon ourselves, but I shall  esteem this as a most just apology for us, and taken from those our  laws, according to which we lead our lives, against the many and the  lying objections that have been made against us. Moreover, since this  Apollonius does not do like Apion, and lay a continued accusation  against us, but does it only by starts, and up and clown his discourse,  while he sometimes reproaches us as atheists, and man-haters, and  sometimes hits us in the teeth with our want of courage, and yet  sometimes, on the contrary, accuses us of too great boldness and  madness in our conduct; nay, he says that we are the weakest of all the  barbarians, and that this is the reason why we are the only people who  have made no improvements in human life; now I think I shall have then  sufficiently disproved all these his allegations, when it shall appear  that our laws enjoin the very reverse of what he says, and that we very  carefully observe those laws ourselves. And if I he compelled to make  mention of the laws of other nations, that are contrary to ours, those  ought deservedly to thank themselves for it, who have pretended to  depreciate our laws in comparison of their own; nor will there, I think,  be any room after that for them to pretend either that we have no such  laws ourselves, an epitome of which I will present to the reader, or  that we do not, above all men, continue in the observation of them.    16. To begin then a good way backward, I would advance this, in the  first place, that those who have been admirers of good order, and of  living under common laws, and who began to introduce them, may well have  this testimony that they are better than other men, both for moderation  and such virtue as is agreeable to nature. Indeed their endeavor was to  have every thing they ordained believed to be very ancient, that  they might not be thought to imitate others, but might appear to have  delivered a regular way of living to others after them. Since then this  is the case, the excellency of a legislator is seen in providing for the  people's living after the best manner, and in prevailing with those that  are to use the laws he ordains for them, to have a good opinion of  them, and in obliging the multitude to persevere in them, and to make no  changes in them, neither in prosperity nor adversity. Now I venture to  say, that our legislator is the most ancient of all the legislators whom  we have ally where heard of; for as for the Lycurguses, and Solons, and  Zaleucus Locrensis, and all those legislators who are so admired by the  Greeks, they seem to be of yesterday, if compared with our legislator,  insomuch as the very name of a law was not so much as known in old times  among the Grecians. Homer is a witness to the truth of this observation,  who never uses that term in all his poems; for indeed there was then no  such thing among them, but the multitude was governed by wise maxims,  and by the injunctions of their king. It was also a long time that they  continued in the use of these unwritten customs, although they were  always changing them upon several occasions. But for our legislator,  who was of so much greater antiquity than the rest, [as even those that  speak against us upon all occasions do always confess,] he exhibited  himself to the people as their best governor and counselor, and included  in his legislation the entire conduct of their lives, and prevailed with  them to receive it, and brought it so to pass, that those that were made  acquainted with his laws did most carefully observe them.    17. But let us consider his first and greatest work; for when it was  resolved on by our forefathers to leave Egypt, and return to their  own country, this Moses took the many tell thousands that were of the  people, and saved them out of many desperate distresses, and brought  them home in safety. And certainly it was here necessary to travel over  a country without water, and full of sand, to overcome their enemies,  and, during these battles, to preserve their children, and their wives,  and their prey; on all which occasions he became an excellent general of  an army, and a most prudent counselor, and one that took the truest  care of them all; he also so brought it about, that the whole multitude  depended upon him. And while he had them always obedient to what he  enjoined, he made no manner of use of his authority for his own private  advantage, which is the usual time when governors gain great powers to  themselves, and pave the way for tyranny, and accustom the multitude  to live very dissolutely; whereas, when our legislator was in so great  authority, he, on the contrary, thought he ought to have regard to  piety, and to show his great good-will to the people; and by this means  he thought he might show the great degree of virtue that was in him, and  might procure the most lasting security to those who had made him their  governor. When he had therefore come to such a good resolution, and  had performed such wonderful exploits, we had just reason to look upon  ourselves as having him for a divine governor and counselor. And when  he had first persuaded himself [17] that his actions and designs were  agreeable to God's will, he thought it his duty to impress, above all  things, that notion upon the multitude; for those who have once believed  that God is the inspector of their lives, will not permit themselves  in any sin. And this is the character of our legislator: he was no  impostor, no deceiver, as his revilers say, though unjustly, but such  a one as they brag Minos [18] to have been among the Greeks, and other  legislators after him; for some of them suppose that they had their laws  from Jupiter, while Minos said that the revelation of his laws was to  be referred to Apollo, and his oracle at Delphi, whether they really  thought they were so derived, or supposed, however, that they could  persuade the people easily that so it was. But which of these it was who  made the best laws, and which had the greatest reason to believe  that God was their author, it will be easy, upon comparing those laws  themselves together, to determine; for it is time that we come to that  point. [19] Now there are innumerable differences in the particular  customs and laws that are among all mankind, which a man may briefly  reduce under the following heads: Some legislators have permitted their  governments to be under monarchies, others put them under oligarchies,  and others under a republican form; but our legislator had no regard  to any of these forms, but he ordained our government to be what, by a  strained expression, may be termed a Theocracy, [20] by ascribing the  authority and the power to God, and by persuading all the people to have  a regard to him, as the author of all the good things that were enjoyed  either in common by all mankind, or by each one in particular, and of  all that they themselves obtained by praying to him in their greatest  difficulties. He informed them that it was impossible to escape God's  observation, even in any of our outward actions, or in any of our  inward thoughts. Moreover, he represented God as unbegotten, [21] and  immutable, through all eternity, superior to all mortal conceptions in  pulchritude; and, though known to us by his power, yet unknown to us as  to his essence. I do not now explain how these notions of God are the  sentiments of the wisest among the Grecians, and how they were taught  them upon the principles that he afforded them. However, they testify,  with great assurance, that these notions are just, and agreeable to the  nature of God, and to his majesty; for Pythagoras, and Anaxagoras, and  Plato, and the Stoic philosophers that succeeded them, and almost all  the rest, are of the same sentiments, and had the same notions of the  nature of God; yet durst not these men disclose those true notions to  more than a few, because the body of the people were prejudiced with  other opinions beforehand. But our legislator, who made his actions  agree to his laws, did not only prevail with those that were his  contemporaries to agree with these his notions, but so firmly imprinted  this faith in God upon all their posterity, that it never could be  removed. The reason why the constitution of this legislation was ever  better directed to the utility of all than other legislations were, is  this, that Moses did not make religion a part of virtue, but he saw and  he ordained other virtues to be parts of religion; I mean justice, and  fortitude, and temperance, and a universal agreement of the members of  the community with one another; for all our actions and studies, and all  our words, [in Moses's settlement,] have a reference to piety towards  God; for he hath left none of these in suspense, or undetermined.  For there are two ways of coming at any sort of learning and a moral  conduct of life; the one is by instruction in words, the other by  practical exercises. Now other lawgivers have separated these two ways  in their opinions, and choosing one of those ways of instruction, or  that which best pleased every one of them, neglected the other. Thus did  the Lacedemonians and the Cretians teach by practical exercises, but not  by words; while the Athenians, and almost "]]]
