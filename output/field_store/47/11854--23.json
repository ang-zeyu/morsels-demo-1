The economy is based on the output of a narrow range of  agricultural products, such as jute, which is the main cash crop and  major source of export earnings. Bangladesh is hampered by a relative  lack of natural resources, population growth of more than 2% a year,  large-scale unemployment, and a limited infrastructure; furthermore,  it is highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Despite these constraints,  real GDP growth averaged about 3.5% annually during 1985-89. A strong  agricultural performance in FY90 pushed the growth rate up to 5.5%.  Alleviation of poverty remains the cornerstone of the government's  development strategy.      _#_GDP: $20.4 billion, per capita $180; real growth rate 4.0%  (1990 est.)      _#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 10% (FY90 est.)      _#_Unemployment rate: 30% (FY90 est.)      _#_Budget: revenues $2.2 billion;

(#18)"],[1," scenes_,--it even excluded action (or placed it _before_ the piece or        _behind_ the scenes). The word drama is of Doric origin, and        according to the usage of the Dorian language it meant \"event,\"        \"history,\"--both words in a hieratic sense. The oldest drama        represented local legends, \"sacred history,\" upon which the        foundation of the cult rested (--thus it was not \"action,\" but        fatality. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} in Doric has nothing to do with action).       11 Hegel and his school wrote notoriously obscure German.--_Tr._       12 Was Wagner a German at all? There are reasons enough for putting        this question. It is difficult to find a single German trait in his        character. Great learner that he was, he naturally imitated a great        deal that was German--but that is all. His very soul contradicts        everything which hitherto has been regarded as German, not to        mention German musicians!--His father was an actor of the name of        Geyer.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} That which has been popularised hitherto as \"Wagner's life\"        is _fable convenue_ if not something worse. I confess my doubts on        any point which is vouched for by Wagner alone. He was not proud        enough to be able to suffer the truth about himself. Nobody had less        pride than he. Like Victor Hugo he remained true to himself even in        his biography,--he remained an actor.       13 This undoubtedly refers to Nietzsche's only disciple and friend,        Peter Gast--_Tr._       14 My \"Genealogy of Morals\" contains the best exposition of the        antithesis \"_noble morality_\" and \"_Christian morality_\"; a more        decisive turning point in the history of religious and moral science        does not perhaps exist. This book, which is a touchstone by which I        can discover who are my peers, rejoices in being accessible only to        the most elevated and most severe minds: the others have not the        ears to hear me. One must have one's passion in things, _wherein_ no        one has passion nowadays.       15 An allusion to Schiller's poem: \"Das verschleierte Bild zu        Sais.\"--_Tr._       16 What Schiller said of Goethe.--_Tr._       17 See note on page 37.       18 It should be noted that the German Catholic party is called the        Ultramontane Party. The river which can thus flow over mountains is        Catholicism, towards which Nietzsche thought Wagner's art to be        tending.--_Tr._"]]]
