Then the exorcists, to  the number of eight, having commanded the devils to be silent and to  cease their tumult, ordered a brazier to be brought, and into this they  threw the pacts one by one, whereupon the convulsions returned with such  awful violence and confused cries, rising into frenzied shrieks, and  accompanied by such horrible contortions, that the scene might have been  taken for an orgy of witches, were it not for the sanctity of the place  and the character of those present, of whom Grandier, in outward seeming  at least, was the least amazed of any, although he had the most reason.  The devils continued their accusations, citing the places, the days, and  the hours of their intercourse with him; the first spell he cast on  them, his scandalous behaviour, his insensibility, his abjurations of  God and the faith. To all this he calmly returned that these accusations  were calumnies, and all the more unjust considering his profession; that  he renounced Satan and all his fiends, having neither knowledge nor  comprehension of them; that in spite of all he was a Christian, and what  was more, an anointed priest; that though he knew himself to be a sinful  man, yet his trust was in God and in His Christ; that he had never  indulged in such abominations, end that it would be impossible to  furnish any pertinent and convincing proof of his guilt.    \"At this point no words could express what the senses perceived; eyes  and ears received an impression of being surrounded by furies such as  had never been gathered together before; and unless accustomed to such  ghastly scenes as those who sacrifice to demons, no one could keep his  mind free from astonishment and horror in the midst of such a spectacle.  Grandier alone remained unchanged through it all, seemingly insensible  to the monstrous exhibitions, singing hymns to the Lord with the rest of  the people, as confident as if he were guarded by legions of angels. One  of the demons cried out that Beelzebub was standing between him and Pere  Tranquille the Capuchin, upon which Grandier said to the demon--    \"'Obmutescas!' (Hold thy peace).    \"Upon this the demon began to curse, and said that was their watchword;  but they could not hold their peace, because God was infinitely  powerful, and the powers of hell could not prevail against Him.  Thereupon they all struggled to get at Grandier, threatening to tear him  limb from limb, to point out his marks, to strangle him although he was  their master; whereupon he seized a chance to say he was neither their  master nor their servant, and that it was incredible that they should in  the same breath acknowledge him for their master and express a desire to  strangle him: on hearing this, the frenzy of the nuns reached its  height, and they kicked their slippers into his face.    \"'Just look!' said he; 'the shoes drop from the hoofs of their own  accord.'    \"At length, had it not been for the help and interposition of people in  the choir, the nuns in their frenzy would have taken the life of the  chief personage in this spectacle; so there was no choice but to take  him away from the church and the furies who threatened his life. He was  therefore brought back to prison about six o'clock in the evening, and  the rest of the day the exorcists were employed in calming the poor  sisters--a task of no small difficulty.\"    Everyone did not regard the possessed sisters with the indulgent eye of  the author of the above narrative, and many saw in this terrible  exhibition of hysteria and convulsions an infamous and sacrilegious  orgy, at which revenge ran riot. There was such difference of opinion  about it that it was considered necessary to publish the following  proclamation by means of placards on July 2nd:    \"All persons, of whatever rank or profession, are hereby expressly  forbidden to traduce, or in any way malign, the nuns and other persons  at Loudun possessed by evil spirits; or their exorcists; or those who  accompany them either to the places appointed for exorcism or elsewhere;  in any form or manner whatever, on pain of a fine of ten thousand  livres, or a larger sum and corporal punishment should the case so  require; and in order that no one may plead ignorance hereof, this  proclamation will be read and published to-day from the pulpits of all  the churches, and copies affixed to the church doors and in other  suitable public places.    \"Done at Loudun, July 2nd, 1634.\"    This order had great influence with worldly folk, and from that moment,  whether their belief was strengthened or not, they no longer dared to  express any incredulity. But in spite of that, the judges were put to  shame, for the nuns themselves began to repent; and on the day following  the impious scene above described, just as Pere Lactanee began to  exorcise Sister Claire in the castle chapel, she rose, and turning  towards the congregation, while tears ran down her cheeks, said in a  voice that could be heard by all present, that she was going to speak  the truth at last in the sight of Heaven. Thereupon she confessed that  all that she had said during the last fortnight against Grandier was  calumnious and false, and that all her actions had been done at the  instigation of the Franciscan Pere Lactance, the director, Mignon, and  the Carmelite brothers. Pere Lactance, not in the least taken aback,  declared that her confession was a fresh wile of the devil to save her  master Grandier. She then made an urgent appeal to the bishop and to M.  de Laubardemont, asking to be sequestered and placed in charge of other  priests than those who had destroyed her soul, by making her bear false  witness against an innocent man; but they only laughed at the pranks the  devil was playing, and ordered her to be at once taken back to the house  in which she was then living. When she heard this order, she darted out  of the choir, trying to escape through the church door, imploring those  present to come to her assistance and save her from everlasting  damnation. But such terrible fruit had the proclamation borne that noon  dared respond, so she was recaptured and taken back to the house in  which she was sequestered, never to leave it again.          CHAPTER X      The next day a still more extraordinary scene took place. While M. de  Laubardemont was questioning one of the nuns, the superior came down  into the court, barefooted; in her chemise, and a cord round her neck;  and there she remained for two hours, in the midst of a fearful storm,  not shrinking before lightning, thunder, or rain, but waiting till M. de  Laubardemont and the other exorcists should come out. At length the door  opened and the royal commissioner appeared, whereupon Sister Jeanne des  Anges, throwing herself at his feet, declared she had not sufficient  strength to play the horrible part they had made her learn any longer,  and that before God and man she declared Urbain Grandier innocent,  saying that all the hatred which she and her companions had felt against  him arose from the baffled desires which his comeliness awoke--desires  which the seclusion of conventional life made still more ardent. M. de  Laubardemont threatened her with the full weight of his displeasure, but  she answered, weeping bitterly, that all she now dreaded was her sin,  for though the mercy of the Saviour was great, she felt that the crime  she had committed could never be pardoned. M. de Laubardemont exclaimed  that it was the demon who dwelt in her who was speaking, but she replied  that the only demon by whom she had even been possessed was the spirit  of vengeance, and that it was indulgence in her own evil thoughts, and  not a pact with the devil, which had admitted him into her heart.    With these words she withdrew slowly, still weeping, and going into the  garden, attached one end of the cord round her neck to the branch of a  tree, and hanged herself. But some of the sisters who had followed her  cut her down before life was extinct.    The same day an order for her strict seclusion was issued for her as for  Sister Claire, and the circumstances that she was a relation of M. de  Laubardemont did not avail to lessen her punishment in view of the  gravity of her fault.    It was impossible to continue the exorcisms other nuns might be tempted  to follow the example, of the superior and Sister Claire, and in that  case all would be lost. And besides, was not Urbain Grandier well and  duly convicted? It was announced, therefore, that the examination had  proceeded far enough, and that the judges would consider the evidence  and deliver judgment.    This long succession of violent and irregular breaches of law procedure,  the repeated denials of his claim to justice, the refusal to let his  witnesses appear, or to listen to his defence, all combined to convince  Grandier that his ruin was determined on; for the case had gone so far  and had attained such publicity that it was necessary either to punish  him as a sorcerer and magician or to render a royal commissioner, a  bishop, an entire community of nuns, several monks of various orders,  many judges of high reputation, and laymen of birth and standing, liable  to the penalties incurred by calumniators. But although, as this  conviction grew, he confronted it with resignation, his courage did not  fail,--and holding it to be his duty as a man and a Christian to defend  his life and honour to the end, he drew up and published another  memorandum, headed Reasons for Acquittal, and had copies laid before his  judges. It was a weighty and, impartial summing up of the whole case,  such as a stranger might have written, and began, with these words.    \"I entreat you in all humility to consider deliberately and with  attention what the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2748"],[0,"Derues (#18)"],[1,"tactics. He therefore changed his  plans, contenting \"himself for the moment with the part of an observer  only, and watching a duel between two fairly matched antagonists.    \"I require: you to tell me what has become of them,\" repeated Monsieur  de Lamotte. \"I have been to Versailles, you assured me they were there.\"    \"And I told you the truth, monsieur.\"    \"No one has seen them, no one knows them; every trace is lost. Your  Honour, this man must be compelled to answer, he must say what has  become of my wife and son!\"    \"I excuse your anxiety, I understand your trouble, but why appeal to me?  Why am I supposed to know what may have happened to them?\"    \"Because I confided them to your care.\"    \"As a friend, yes, I agree. Yes, it is quite true that last December I  received a letter from you informing me of the impending arrival of your  wife and son. I received them in my own house, and showed them the same  hospitality which I had received from you. I saw them both, your son  often, your wife every day, until the day she left me to go to  Versailles. Yes, I also took Edouard to his mother, who was negotiating  an appointment for him. I have already told you all this, and I repeat  it because it is the truth. You believed me then: why do you not believe  me now? Why has what I say become strange and incredible? If your wife  and your son have disappeared, am I responsible? Did you transmit your  authority to me? And now, in what manner are you thus calling me to  account? Is it to the friend who might have pitied, who might have aided  your search, that you thus address yourself? Have you come to confide in  me, to ask for advice, for consolation? No, you accuse me; very well!  then I refuse to speak, because, having no proofs, you yet accuse an  honest man; because your fears, whether real or imaginary, do not excuse  you for casting, I know not what odious suspicions, on a blameless  reputation, because I have the right to be offended. Monsieur\" he  continued, turning to the magistrate, \"I believe you will appreciate my  moderation, and will allow me to retire. If charges are brought against  me, I am quite ready to meet them, and to show what they are really  worth. I shall remain in Paris, I have now no business which requires my  presence elsewhere.\"    He emphasised these last words, evidently intending to draw attention to  them. It did not escape the magistrate, who inquired--    \"What do you mean by that?\"    \"Nothing beyond my words, your Honour, Have I your permission to  retire?\"    \"No, remain; you are pretending not to understand.\"    \"I do not understand these insinuations so covertly made.\"    Monsieur de Lamotte rose, exclaiming--    \"Insinuations! What more can I say to compel you to answer? My wife and  son have disappeared. It is untrue that, as you pretend, they have been  at Versailles. You deceived me at Buisson-Souef, just as you are  deceiving me now, as you are endeavouring to deceive justice by  inventing fresh lies. Where are they? What has become of them? I am  tormented by all the fears possible to a husband and father; I imagine  all the most terrible misfortunes, and I accuse you to your face of  having caused their death! Is this sufficient, or do you still accuse me  of covert insinuations?\"    Derues turned to the magistrate. \"Is this charge enough to place me in  the position of a criminal if I do not give a satisfactory explanation?\"    \"Certainly; you should have thought of that sooner.\"    \"Then,\" he continued, addressing Monsieur de Lamotte, \"I understand you  persist in this odious accusation?\"    \"I certainly persist in it.\"    \"You have forgotten our friendship, broken all bonds between us: I am in  your eyes only a miserable assassin? You consider my silence as guilty,  you will ruin me if I do not speak?\"    \"It is true.\"    \"There is still time for reflection; consider what you are doing; I will  forget your insults and your anger. Your trouble is great enough without  my reproaches being added to it. But you desire that I should speak, you  desire it absolutely?\"    \"I do desire it.\"    \"Very well, then; it shall be as you wish.\"    Derues surveyed Monsieur de Lamotte with a look which seemed to say, \"I  pity you.\" He then added, with a sigh--    \"I am now ready to answer. Your Honour, will you have the kindness to  resume my examination?\"    Derues had succeeded in taking up an advantageous position. If he had  begun narrating the extraordinary romance he had invented, the least  penetrating eye must have perceived its improbability, and one would  have felt it required some support at every turn. But since he had  resisted being forced to tell it, and apparently only ceded to Monsieur  de Lamotte's violent persistency, the situation was changed; and this  refusal to speak, coming from a man who thereby compromised his personal  safety, took the semblance of generosity, and was likely to arouse the  magistrate's curiosity and prepare his mind for unusual and mysterious  revelations. This was exactly what Derues wanted, and he awaited the  interrogation with calm and tranquillity.    \"Why did you leave Paris?\" the magistrate demanded a second time.    \"I have already had the honour to inform you that important business  necessitated my absence.\"    \"But you refused to explain the nature of this business. Do you still  persist in this refusal?\"    \"For the moment, yes. I will explain it later.\"    \"Where have you been? Whence do you return?\"    \"I have been to Lyons, and have returned thence.\"    \"What took you there?    \"I will tell you later.\"    \"In the month of December last, Madame de Lamotte and her son came to  Paris?    \"That is so.\"    \"They both lodged in your house?\"    \"I have no reason to deny it.\"    \"But neither she herself, nor Monsieur de Lamotte, had at first intended  that she should accept a lodging in the house which you occupied.\"    \"That is quite true. We had important accounts to settle, and Madame de  Lamotte told me afterwards that she feared some dispute on the question  of money might arise between us--at least, that is the reason she gave  me. She was mistaken, as the event proved, since I always intended to  pay, and I have paid. But she may have had another reason which she  preferred not to give.\"    \"It was the distrust of this man which she felt,\" exclaimed Monsieur de  Lamotte. Derues answered only with a melancholy smile.    \"Silence, monsieur,\" said the magistrate, \"silence; do not interrupt.\"  Then addressing Derues--    \"Another motive? What motive do you suppose?\"    \"Possibly she preferred to be more free, and able to receive any visitor  she wished.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"It is only supposition on my part, I do not insist upon it.\"    \"But the supposition appears to contain a hint injurious to Madame de  Lamotte's reputation?\"    \"No, oh no!\" replied Derues, after a moment's silence.    This sort of insinuation appeared strange to the magistrate, who  resolved to try and force Derues to abandon these treacherous reticences  behind which he sheltered himself. Again recommending silence to  Monsieur de Lamotte, he continued to question Derues, not perceiving  that he was only following the lead skilfully given by the latter, who  drew him gradually on by withdrawing himself, and that all the time thus  gained was an advantage to the accused.    \"Well,\" said the magistrate, \"whatever Madame de Lamotte's motives may  have been, it ended in her coming to stay with you. How did you persuade  her to take this step?\"    \"My wife accompanied her first to the Hotel de France, and then to other  hotels. I said no more than might be deemed allowable in a friend; I  could not presume to persuade her against her will. When I returned  home, I was surprised to find her there with her son. She could not find  a disengaged room in any of the hotels she tried, and she then accepted  my offer.\"    \"What date was this?\"    \"Monday, the 16th of last December.\"    \"And when did she leave your house?\"    \"On the 1st of February.\"    \"The porter cannot remember having seen her go out on that day.\"    \"That is possible. Madame de Lamotte went and came as her affairs  required. She was known, and no more attention would be paid to her than  to any other inmate.\"    \"The porter also says that for several days before this date she was  ill, and obliged to keep her room?\"    \"Yes, it was a slight indisposition, which had no results, so slight  that it seemed unnecessary to call in a doctor. Madame de Lamotte  appeared preoccupied and anxious. I think her mental attitude influenced  her health.\"    \"Did you escort her to Versailles?\"    \"No; I went there to see her later.\"    \"What proof can you give of her having actually stayed there?\"    \"None whatever, unless it be a letter which I received from her.\"    \"You told Monsieur de, Lamotte that she was exerting herself to procure  her son's admission either as a king's page or into the riding school.  Now, no one at Versailles has seen this lady, or even heard of her.\"    \"I only repeated what she told me.\"    \"Where was she staying?\"    \"I do not know.\"    \"What! she wrote to you, you went to see her, and yet you do not know  where she was lodging?\"    \"That is so.\"    \"But it is impossible.\"    \"There are many things which would appear impossible if I were to relate  them, but which are true, nevertheless.\"    \"Explain yourself.\"    \"I only received one letter from Madame de Lamotte, in which she spoke  of her plans for Edouard, requesting me to send her her son on a day she  fixed, and I told Edouard of her projects. Not being able to go to the  school to see him, I wrote, asking if he would like to give up his  studies and become a royal page. When I was last at Buisson-Souef, I  showed his answer to Monsieur de Lamotte; it is here.\"    And he handed over a letter to the magistrate, who read it, and passing  it on to Monsieur de Lamotte, inquired--    \"Did you then, and do you"]]]
