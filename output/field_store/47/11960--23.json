[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31078"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature, Vol. 3 (#18)"],[1," have joined what the spirit of party  had sundered!    Do we flatter ourselves that the Logomachies of the Nominalists and the  Realists terminated with these scolding schoolmen? Modern nonsense,  weighed against the obsolete, may make the scales tremble for awhile,  but it will lose its agreeable quality of freshness, and subside into an  equipoise. We find their spirit still lurking among our own  metaphysicians! \"Lo! the Nominalists and the Realists again!\" exclaimed  my learned friend, Sharon Turner, alluding to our modern doctrines on  _abstract ideas_, on which there is still a doubt whether they are  anything more than _generalising terms_.[42] Leibnitz confused his  philosophy by the term _sufficient reason_: for every existence, for  every event, and for every truth there must be a _sufficient reason_.  This vagueness of language produced a perpetual misconception, and  Leibnitz was proud of his equivocal triumphs in always affording a new  interpretation! It is conjectured that he only employed his term of  _sufficient reason_ for the plain simple word of _cause_. Even Locke,  who has himself so admirably noticed the \"abuse of words,\" has been  charged with using vague and indefinite ones; he has sometimes employed  the words _reflection_, _mind_, and _spirit_ in so indefinite a way,  that they have confused his philosophy: thus by some ambiguous  expressions, our great metaphysician has been made to establish  doctrines fatal to the immutability of moral distinctions. Even the  eagle-eye of the intellectual Newton grew dim in the obscurity of the  language of Locke. We are astonished to discover that two such  intellects should not comprehend the same ideas; for Newton wrote to  Locke, \"I beg your pardon for representing that you struck at the root  of morality in a principle laid down in your book of Ideas--and that I  took you for a Hobbist!\"[43] The difference of opinion between Locke and  Reid is in consequence of an ambiguity in the word _principle_, as  employed by Reid. The removal of a solitary word may cast a luminous ray  over a whole body of philosophy: \"If we had called the _infinite_ the  _indefinite_,\" says Condillac, in his _Traite des Sensations_, \"by this  small change of a word we should have avoided the error of imagining  that we have a positive idea of _infinity_, from whence so many false  reasonings have been carried on, not only by metaphysicians, but even by  geometricians.\" The word _reason_ has been used with different meanings  by different writers; _reasoning_ and _reason_ have been often  confounded; a man may have an endless capacity for _reasoning_, without  being much influenced by _reason_, and to be _reasonable_, perhaps  differs from both! So Moliere tells us,      Raisonner est l'emploi de toute ma maison;    Et le raisonnement en bannit la raison!    In this research on \"confusion of words,\" might enter the voluminous  history of the founders of sects, who have usually employed terms which  had no meaning attached to them, or were so ambiguous that their real  notions have never been comprehended; hence the most chimerical opinions  have been imputed to founders of sects. We may instance that of the  _Antinomians_, whose remarkable denomination explains their doctrine,  expressing that they were \"against law!\" Their founder was John  Agricola, a follower of Luther, who, while he lived, had kept Agricola's  follies from exploding, which they did when he asserted that there was  no such thing as sin, our salvation depending on faith, and not on  works; and when he declaimed against the _Law of God_. To what length  some of his sect pushed this verbal doctrine is known; but the real  notions of this Agricola probably never will be! Bayle considered him as  a harmless dreamer in theology, who had confused his head by Paul's  controversies with the Jews; but Mosheim, who bestows on this early  reformer the epithets of _ventosus_ and _versipellis_, windy and crafty!  or, as his translator has it, charges him with \"vanity, presumption, and  artifice,\" tells us by the term \"law,\" Agricola only meant the ten  commandments of Moses, which he considered were abrogated by the Gospel,  being designed for the Jews and not for the Christians. Agricola then,  by the words the \"Law of God,\" and \"that there was no such thing as  sin,\" must have said one thing and meant another! This appears to have  been the case with most of the divines of the sixteenth century; for  even Mosheim complains of \"their want of precision and consistency in  expressing _their sentiments_, hence their real sentiments have been  misunderstood.\" There evidently prevailed a great \"confusion of words\"  among them! The _grace suffisante_ and the _grace efficace_ of the  Jansenists and the Jesuits show the shifts and stratagems by which  nonsense may be dignified. \"Whether all men received from God  _sufficient grace_ for their conversion!\" was an inquiry some unhappy  metaphysical theologist set afloat: the Jesuits, according to their  worldly system of making men's consciences easy, affirmed it; but the  Jansenists insisted, that this _sufficient grace_ would never be  _efficacious_, unless accompanied by _special grace_. \"Then the  _sufficient grace_, which is not _efficacious_, is a contradiction in  terms, and worse, a heresy!\" triumphantly cried the Jesuits, exulting  over their adversaries. This \"confusion of words\" thickened, till the  Jesuits introduced in this logomachy with the Jansenists papal bulls,  royal edicts, and a regiment of dragoons! The Jansenists, in despair,  appealed to miracles and prodigies, which they got up for public  representation; but, above all, to their Pascal, whose immortal satire  the Jesuits really felt was at once \"sufficient and efficacious,\"  though the dragoons, in settling a \"confusion of words,\" did not boast  of inferior success to Pascal's. Former ages had, indeed, witnessed even  a more melancholy logomachy, in the _Homoousion_ and the _Homoiousion_!  An event which Boileau has immortalised by some fine verses, which, in  his famous satire on _L'Equivoque_, for reasons best known to the  Sorbonne, were struck out of the text.      D'une _syllabe_ impie un saint _mot_ augmente    Remplit tous les esprits d'aigreurs si meurtrieres--    Tu fis, dans une guerre et si triste et si longue,    Perir tant de Chretiens, _martyrs d'une diphthongue_!    Whether the Son was similar to the substance of the Father, or of the  same substance, depended on the diphthong _oi_, which was alternately  rejected and received. Had they earlier discovered, what at length they  agreed on, that the words denoted what was incomprehensible, it would  have saved thousands, as a witness describes, \"from tearing one another  to pieces.\" The great controversy between Abelard and St. Bernard, when  the saint accused the scholastic of maintaining heretical notions of the  Trinity, long agitated the world; yet, now that these confusers of words  can no longer inflame our passions, we wonder how these parties could  themselves differ about words to which we can attach no meaning  whatever. There have been few councils or synods where the omission or  addition of a word or a phrase might not have terminated an interminable  logomachy! At the council of Basle, for the convenience of the  disputants, John de Secubia drew up a treatise of _undeclined words_,  chiefly to determine the signification of the particles _from_, _by_,  _but_, and _except_, which it seems were perpetually occasioning fresh  disputes among the Hussites and the Bohemians. Had Jerome of Prague  known, like our Shakspeare, the virtue of an IF, or agreed with Hobbes,  that he should not have been so positive in the use of the verb IS, he  might have been spared from the flames. The philosopher of Malmsbury has  declared that \"Perhaps _Judgment_ was nothing else but the composition  or joining of _two names of things, or modes_, by the verb IS.\" In  modern times the popes have more skilfully freed the church from this  \"confusion of words.\" His holiness, on one occasion, standing in equal  terror of the court of France, who protected the Jesuits, and of the  court of Spain, who maintained the cause of the Dominicans, contrived a  phrase, where a comma or a full stop, placed at the beginning or the  end, purported that his holiness tolerated the opinions which he  condemned; and when the rival parties despatched deputations to the  court of Rome to plead for the period, or advocate the comma, his  holiness, in this \"confusion of words,\" flung an unpunctuated copy to  the parties; nor was it his fault, but that of the spirit of party, if  the rage of the one could not subside into a comma, nor that of the  other close by a full period!    In jurisprudence much confusion has occurred in the uses of the term  _rights_; yet the social union and human happiness are involved in the  precision of the expression. When Montesquieu laid down, as the active  principle of a republic, _virtue_, it seemed to infer that a republic  was the best of governments. In the defence of his great work he was  obliged to define the term; and it seems that by _virtue_ he only meant  _political virtue_, the love of the country.    In politics, what evils have resulted from abstract terms to which no  ideas are affixed,--such as, \"The Equality of Man--the Sovereignty or  the Majesty of the People--Loyalty--Reform--even Liberty  herself!--Public Opinion--Public Interest;\" and other abstract notions,  which have excited the hatred or the ridicule of the vulgar. Abstract  ideas, as _sounds_, have been used as watchwords. The combatants will  usually be found willing to fight for words to which, perhaps, not one  of them has attached any settled signification. This is admirably  touched on by Locke, in his chapter of \"Abuse of Words.\" \"Wisdom, Glory,  Grace, &c., are words frequent enough in every man's mouth; but if a  great many of those who use them should "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31111"],[0,"Across Asia on a Bicycle (#18)"],[1,"Russian language and methods, and  native apprentices are being taken in by Russian merchants for the same  purpose.    In Tashkend, as in every European city of the Orient, drunkenness, and  gambling, and social laxity have followed upon the introduction of Western  morals and culture. Jealousy and intrigue among the officers and  functionaries are also not strange, perhaps, at so great a distance from  headquarters, where the only avenue to distinction seems to lie through  the public service. At the various dinner-parties and sociables given  throughout the winter, the topic of war always met with general welcome.  On one occasion a report was circulated that Abdurrahman Khan, the Ameer  of Afghanistan, was lying at the point of death. Great preparations, it  was said, were being made for an expedition over the Pamir, to establish  on the throne the Russian candidate, Is-shah Khan from Samarkand, before  Ayub Khan, the rival British protege, could be brought from India. The  young officers at once began to discuss their chances for promotion, and  the number of decorations to be forthcoming from St. Petersburg. The  social gatherings at Tashkend were more convivial than sociable.  Acquaintances can eat and drink together with the greatest of good cheer,  but there is very little sympathy in conversation. It was difficult for  them to understand why we had come so far to see a country which to many  of them was a place of exile.      [Illustration: A SART RESCUING HIS CHILDREN FROM THE CAMERA OF THE    \"FOREIGN DEVILS.\"]    An early spring did not mean an early departure from winter quarters.  Impassable roads kept us anxious prisoners for a month and a half after  the necessary papers had been secured. These included, in addition to the  local passports, a carte-blanche permission to travel from Tashkend to  Vladivostock through Turkestan and Siberia, a document obtained from St.  Petersburg through the United States minister, the Hon. Charles Emory  Smith. Of this route to the Pacific we were therefore certain, and yet,  despite the universal opinion that a bicycle journey across the Celestial  empire was impracticable, we had determined to continue on to the border  line, and there to seek better information. \"Don't go into China\" were the  last words of our many kind friends as we wheeled out of Tashkend on the  seventh of May.    At Chimkend our course turned abruptly from what was once the main route  between Russia's European and Asiatic capitals, and along which De  Lesseps, in his letter to the Czar, proposed a line of railroad to connect  Orenburg with Samarkand, a distance about equal to that between St.  Petersburg and Odessa, 1483 miles. This is also the keystone in that wall  of forts which Russia gradually raised around her unruly nomads of the  steppes, and where, according to Gortchakoff's circular of 1864, \"both  interest and reason\" required her to stop; and yet at that very time  General Tchernaieff was advancing his forces upon the present capital,  Tashkend. Here, too, we began that journey of 1500 miles along the  Celestial mountain range which terminated only when we scaled its summit  beyond Barkul to descend again into the burning sands of the Desert of  Gobi. Here runs the great historical highway between China and the West.    From Auli-eta eastward we had before us about 200 miles of a vast steppe  region. Near the mountains is a wilderness of lakes, swamps, and streams,  which run dry in summer. This is the country of the \"Thousand Springs\"  mentioned by the Chinese pilgrim Huen T'sang, and where was established  the kingdom of Black China, supposed by many to have been one of the  kingdoms of \"Prester John.\" But far away to our left were the white sands  of the Ak-Kum, over which the cloudless atmosphere quivers incessantly,  like the blasts of a furnace. Of all these deserts, occupying probably one  half of the whole Turkestan steppe, none is more terrible than that of the  \"Golodnaya Steppe,\" or Steppe of Hunger, to the north of the \"White Sands\"  now before us. Even in the cool of evening, it is said that the soles of  the wayfarer's feet become scorched, and the dog accompanying him finds no  repose till he has burrowed below the burning surface. The monotonous  appearance of the steppe itself is only intensified in winter, when the  snow smooths over the broken surface, and even necessitates the placing of  mud posts at regular intervals to mark the roadway for the Kirghiz  post-drivers. But in the spring and autumn its arid surface is clothed, as  if by enchantment, with verdure and prairie flowers. Both flowers and  birds are gorgeously colored. One variety, about half the size of the  jackdaw which infests the houses of Tashkend and Samarkand, has a bright  blue body and red wings; another, resembling our field-lark in size and  habits, combines a pink breast with black head and wings. But already this  springtide splendor was beginning to disappear beneath the glare of  approaching summer. The long wagon-trains of lumber, and the occasional  traveler's tarantass rumbling along to the discord of its _duga_ bells,  were enveloped in a cloud of suffocating dust.      [Illustration: VIEW OF CHIMKEND FROM THE CITADEL.]    Now and then we would overtake a party of Russian peasants migrating from  the famine-stricken districts of European Russia to the pioneer colonies  along this Turkestan highway. The peculiarity of these villages is their  extreme length, all the houses facing on the one wide street. Most of them  are merely mud huts, others make pretensions to doors and windows, and a  coat of whitewash. Near-by usually stands the old battered telega which  served as a home during many months of travel over the Orenburg highway.  It speaks well for the colonizing capacity of the Russians that they can  be induced to come so many hundreds of miles from their native land, to  settle in such a primitive way among the half-wild tribes of the steppes.  As yet they do very little farming, but live, like the Kirghiz, by raising  horses, cows, sheep, and goats, and, in addition, the Russian hog, the  last resembling very much the wild swine of the jungles. Instead of the  former military colonies of plundering Cossacks, who really become more  assimilated to the Kirghiz than these to their conquerors, the _mir_, or  communal system, is now penetrating these fertile districts, and  systematically replacing the Mongolian culture. But the ignorance of this  lower class of Russians is almost as noticeable as that of the natives  themselves. As soon as we entered a village, the blacksmith left his  anvil, the carpenter his bench, the storekeeper his counter, and the  milkmaid her task. After our parade of the principal street, the crowd  would gather round us at the station-house. All sorts of queries and  ejaculations would pass among them. One would ask: \"Are these gentlemen  baptized? Are they really Christians?\" On account of their extreme  ignorance these Russian colonists are by no means able to cope with their  German colleagues, who are given the poorest land, and yet make a better  living.    The steppe is a good place for learning patience. With the absence of  landmarks, you seem never to be getting anywhere. It presents the  appearance of a boundless level expanse, the very undulations of which are  so uniform as to conceal the intervening troughs. Into these, horsemen,  and sometimes whole caravans, mysteriously disappear. In this way we were  often enabled to surprise a herd of gazelles grazing by the roadside. They  would stand for a moment with necks extended, and then scamper away like a  shot, springing on their pipe-stem limbs three or four feet into the air.  Our average rate was about seven miles an hour, although the roads were  sometimes so soft with dust or sand as to necessitate the laying of straw  for a foundation. There was scarcely an hour in the day when we were not  accompanied by from one to twenty Kirghiz horsemen, galloping behind us  with cries of \"Yakshee!\" (\"Good!\") They were especially curious to see how  we crossed the roadside streams. Standing on the bank, they would watch  intently every move as we stripped and waded through with bicycles and  clothing on our shoulders. Then they would challenge us to a race, and, if  the road permitted, we would endeavor to reveal some of the possibilities  of the \"devil's carts.\" On an occasion like this occurred one of our few  mishaps. The road was lined by the occupants of a neighboring tent  village, who had run out to see the race. One of the Kirghiz turned  suddenly back in the opposite direction from which he had started. The  wheel struck him at a rate of fifteen miles per hour, lifting him off his  feet, and hurling over the handle-bars the rider, who fell upon his left  arm, and twisted it out of place. With the assistance of the bystanders it  was pulled back into the socket, and bandaged up till we reached the  nearest Russian village. Here the only physician was an old blind woman of  the faith-cure persuasion. Her massage treatment to replace the muscles  was really effective, and was accompanied by prayers and by signs of the  cross, a common method of treatment among the lower class of Russians. In  one instance a cure was supposed to be effected by writing a prayer on a  piece of buttered bread to be eaten by the patient.      [Illustration: ON THE ROAD BETWEEN CHIMKEND AND VERNOYE.]    Being users but not patrons of the Russian post-roads, we were not legally  entitled to the conveniences of the post-stations. Tipping alone, as we  found on our journey from Samarkand, was not always sufficient to preclude  a request during the night to vacate the best quarters for the  post-traveler, especially if he happened to wear the regulation brass  button. To secure us against this inconvenience, and to gain some special  attention, a letter was obtained from the overseer of the Turkestan post"]]]
