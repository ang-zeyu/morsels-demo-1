Go, and our sire's consent obtain  If thou our maiden hands wouldst gain.  No self-dependent life we live:  If we offend, our fault forgive.\"  But led by folly as a slave,  He would not hear the rede we gave,  And even as we gently spoke  We felt the Wind-God's crushing stroke.\"      The pious king, with grief distressed,  The noble hundred thus addressed:  \"With patience, daughters, bear your fate,  Yours was a deed supremely great  When with one mind you kept from shame  The honour of your father's name.  Patience, when men their anger vent,  Is woman's praise and ornament;  Yet when the Gods inflict the blow  Hard is it to support the woe.  Patience, my girls, exceeds all price:  'Tis alms, and truth, and sacrifice.  Patience is virtue, patience fame:  Patience upholds this earthly frame.  And now, I think, is come the time  To wed you in your maiden prime.  Now, daughters, go where'er you will:  Thoughts for your good my mind shall fill.\"      The maidens went, consoled, away:  The best of kings, that very day,  Summoned his ministers of state  About their marriage to debate.  Since then, because the Wind-God bent  The damsels' forms for punishment,  That royal town is known to fame  By Kanyakubja's(174) borrowed name.      There lived a sage called Chuli then,  Devoutest of the sons of men;  His days in penance rites he spent,  A glorious saint, most continent.  To him absorbed in tasks austere  The child of Urmila drew near,  Sweet Somada, the heavenly maid  And lent the saint her pious aid.  Long time near him the maiden spent,  And served him meek and reverent,  Till the great hermit, pleased with her,  Thus spoke unto his minister:  \"Grateful am I for all thy care:  Blest maiden, speak, thy wish declare.\"  The sweet-voiced nymph rejoiced to see  The favour of the devotee,  And to that eloquent old man,  Most eloquent she thus began:  \"Thou hast, by heavenly grace sustained,  Close union with the Godhead gained.  I long, O Saint, to see a son  By force of holy penance won.  Unwed, a maiden life I live:  A son to me, thy suppliant, give.\"  The saint with favour heard her prayer,  And gave a son exceeding fair.  Him, Chuli's spiritual child,  His mother Brahmadatta(175) styled.  King Brahmadatta, rich and great,  In Kampili maintained his state,  Ruling, like Indra in his bliss,  His fortunate metropolis.  King Kusanabha planned that he  His hundred daughters' lord should be.  To him, obedient to his call,  The happy monarch gave them all.  Like Indra then he took the hand  Of every maiden of the band.  Soon as the hand of each young maid  In Brahmadatta's palm was laid,  Deformity and cares away,  She shone in beauty bright and gay.  Their freedom from the Wind-God's might  Saw Kusanabha with delight.  Each glance that on their forms he threw  Filled him with raptures ever new.  Then when the rites were all complete,  With highest marks of honour meet  The bridegroom with his brides he sent  To his great seat of government.      The nymph received with pleasant speech  Her daughters; and, embracing each,  Upon their forms she fondly gazed,  And royal Kusanabha praised.          Canto XXXV. Visvamitra's Lineage.      \"The rites were o'er, the maids were wed,  The bridegroom to his home was sped.  The sonless monarch bade prepare  A sacrifice to gain an heir.  Then Kusa, Brahma's son, appeared,  And thus King Kusanabha cheered:  \"Thou shalt, my child, obtain a son  Like thine own self, O holy one.  Through him for ever, Gadhi named,  Shalt thou in all the worlds be famed.\"  He spoke, and vanished from the sight  To Brahma's world of endless light.  Time fled, and, as the saint foretold,  Gadhi was born, the holy-souled.  My sire was he; through him I trace  My line from royal Kusa's race.  My sister--elder-born was she--  The pure and good Satyavati,(176)  Was to the great Richika wed.  Still faithful to her husband dead,  She followed him, most noble dame,  And, raised to heaven in human frame,  A pure celestial stream became.  Down from Himalaya's snowy height,  In floods for ever fair and bright,  My sister's holy waves are hurled  To purify and glad the world.  Now on Himalaya's side I dwell  Because I love my sister well.  She, for her faith and truth renowned,  Most loving to her husband found,  High-fated, firm in each pure vow,  Is queen of all the rivers now.  Bound by a vow I left her side  And to the Perfect convent hied.  There, by the aid 'twas thine to lend,  Made perfect, all my labours end.  Thus, mighty Prince, I now have told  My race and lineage, high and old,  And local tales of long ago  Which thou, O Rama, fain wouldst know.  As I have sate rehearsing thus  The midnight hour is come on us.  Now, Rama, sleep, that nothing may  Our journey of to-morrow stay.  No leaf on any tree is stirred:  Hushed in repose are beast and bird:  Where'er you turn, on every side,  Dense shades of night the landscape hide,  The light of eve is fled: the skies,  Thick-studded with their host of eyes,  Seem a star-forest overhead,  Where signs and constellations spread.  Now rises, with his pure cold ray,  The moon that drives the shades away,  And with his gentle influence brings  Joy to the hearts of living things.  Now, stealing from their lairs, appear  The beasts to whom the night is dear.  Now spirits walk, and every power  That revels in the midnight hour.\"      The mighty hermit's tale was o'er,  He closed his lips and spoke no more.  The holy men on every side,  \"Well done! well done,\" with reverence cried;  \"The mighty men of Kusa's seed  Were ever famed for righteous deed.  Like Brahma's self in glory shine  The high-souled lords of Kusa's line,  And thy great name is sounded most,  O Saint, amid the noble host.  And thy dear sister--fairest she  Of streams, the high-born Kausiki--  Diffusing virtue where she flows,  New splendour on thy lineage throws.\"  Thus by the chief of saints addressed  The son of Gadhi turned to rest;  So, when his daily course is done,  Sinks to his rest the beaming sun.  Rama with Lakshman, somewhat stirred  To marvel by the tales they heard,  Turned also to his couch, to close  His eyelids in desired repose.          Canto XXXVI. The Birth Of Ganga.      The hours of night now waning fast  On Sona's pleasant shore they passed.  Then, when the dawn began to break,  To Rama thus the hermit spake:  \"The light of dawn is breaking clear,  The hour of morning rites is near.  Rise, Rama, rise, dear son, I pray,  And make thee ready for the way.\"      Then Rama rose, and finished all  His duties at the hermit's call,  Prepared with joy the road to take,  And thus again in question spake:  \"Here fair and deep the Sona flows,  And many an isle its bosom shows:  What way, O Saint, will lead us o'er  And land us on the farther shore?\"  The saint replied: \"The way I choose  Is that which pious hermits use.\"  For many a league they journeyed on  Till, when the sun of mid-day shone,  The hermit-haunted flood was seen  Of Jahnavi,(177) the Rivers' Queen.  Soon as the holy stream they viewed,  Thronged with a white-winged multitude  Of sarases(178) and swans,(179) delight  Possessed them at the lovely sight;  And then prepared the hermit band  To halt upon that holy strand.  They bathed as Scripture bids, and paid  Oblations due to God and shade.  To Fire they burnt the offerings meet,  And sipped the oil, like Amrit sweet.  Then pure and pleased they sate around  Saint Visvamitra on the ground.  The holy men of lesser note,  In due degree, sate more remote,  While Raghu's sons took nearer place  By virtue of their rank and race.  Then Rama said: \"O Saint, I yearn  The three-pathed Ganga's tale to learn.\"      Thus urged, the sage recounted both  The birth of Ganga and her growth:  \"The mighty hill with metals stored,  Himalaya, is the mountains' lord,  The father of a lovely pair  Of daughters fairest of the fair:  Their mother, offspring of the will  Of Meru, everlasting hill,  Mena, Himalaya's darling, graced  With beauty of her dainty waist.  Ganga was elder-born: then came  The fair one known by Uma's name.  Then all the Gods of heaven, in need  Of Ganga's help their vows to speed,  To great Himalaya came and prayed  The mountain King to yield the maid.  He, not regardless of the weal  Of the three worlds, with holy zeal  His daughter to the Immortals gave,  Ganga whose waters cleanse and save,  Who roams at pleasure, fair and free,  Purging all sinners, to the sea.  The three-pathed Ganga thus obtained,  The Gods their heavenly homes regained.  Long time the sister Uma passed  In vows austere and rigid fast,  And the king gave the devotee  Immortal Rudra's(180) bride to be,  Matching with that unequalled Lord  His Uma through the worlds adored.  So now a glorious station fills  Each daughter of the King of Hills:  One honoured as the noblest stream,  One mid the Goddesses supreme.  Thus Ganga, King Himalaya's child,  The heavenly river, undefiled,  Rose bearing with her to the sky  Her waves that bless and purify.\"    [I am compelled to omit Cantos XXXVII and XXXVIII, THE GLORY OF UMA, and  THE BIRTH OF KARTIKEYA, as both in subject and language offensive to  modern taste. They will be found in Schlegel's Latin translation.]          Canto XXXIX. The Sons Of Sagar.      The saint in accents sweet and clear  Thus told his tale for Rama's ear,  And thus anew the holy man  A legend to the prince began:  \"There reigned a pious monarch o'er  Ayodhya in the days of yore:  Sagar his name: no child had he,  And children much he longed to see.  His honoured consort, fair of face,  Sprang from Vidarbha's royal race,  Kesini, famed from early youth  For piety and love of truth.  Arishtanemi's daughter fair,  With whom no maiden might compare  In beauty, though the earth is wide,  Sumati, was his second bride.  With his two queens afar he went,  And weary days in penance spent,  Fervent, upon Himalaya's hill  Where springs the stream"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24873"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1896 to 1901 (#18)"],[1,"went to bed that night,  but she was a woman of sound sense and was determined not to give way  to foolish fears. She locked doors and windows carefully, as was her  habit, and saw that the fastenings were good and secure. The one on  the dining-room window, looking out on the back yard, wasn't; in fact,  it was broken altogether; but, as Miss Calista told herself, it had  been broken just so for the last six years, and nobody had ever tried  to get in at it yet, and it wasn't likely anyone would begin tonight.    Miss Calista went to bed and, despite her worry, slept soon and  soundly. It was well on past midnight when she suddenly wakened and  sat bolt upright in bed. She was not accustomed to waken in the night,  and she had the impression of having been awakened by some noise. She  listened breathlessly. Her room was directly over the dining-room, and  an empty stovepipe hole opened up through the ceiling of the latter at  the head of her bed.    There was no mistake about it. Something or some person was moving  about stealthily in the room below. It wasn't the cat--Miss Calista  had shut him in the woodshed before she went to bed, and he couldn't  possibly get out. It must certainly be a beggar or tramp of some  description.    Miss Calista might be given over to nervousness in regard to imaginary  thieves, but in the presence of real danger she was cool and  self-reliant. As noiselessly and swiftly as any burglar himself, Miss  Calista slipped out of bed and into her clothes. Then she tip-toed out  into the hall. The late moonlight, streaming in through the hall  windows, was quite enough illumination for her purpose, and she got  downstairs and was fairly in the open doorway of the dining-room  before a sound betrayed her presence.    Standing at the sideboard, hastily ransacking the neat contents of an  open drawer, stood a man's figure, dimly visible in the moonlight  gloom. As Miss Calista's grim form appeared in the doorway, the  midnight marauder turned with a start and then, with an inarticulate  cry, sprang, not at the courageous lady, but at the open window behind  him.    Miss Calista, realizing with a flash of comprehension that he was  escaping her, had a woman-like impulse to get a blow in anyhow; she  grasped and hurled at her unceremonious caller the first thing that  came to hand--a bottle of peppermint essence that was standing on the  sideboard.    The missile hit the escaping thief squarely on the shoulder as he  sprang out of the window, and the fragments of glass came clattering  down on the sill. The next moment Miss Calista found herself alone,  standing by the sideboard in a half-dazed fashion, for the whole thing  had passed with such lightning-like rapidity that it almost seemed as  if it were the dissolving end of a bad dream. But the open drawer and  the window, where the bits of glass were glistening in the moonlight,  were no dream. Miss Calista recovered herself speedily, closed the  window, lit the lamp, gathered up the broken glass, and set up the  chairs which the would-be thief had upset in his exit. An examination  of the sideboard showed the precious five hundred safe and sound in an  undisturbed drawer.    Miss Calista kept grim watch and ward there until morning, and thought  the matter over exhaustively. In the end she resolved to keep her own  counsel. She had no clue whatever to the thief's whereabouts or  identity, and no good would come of making a fuss, which might only  end in throwing suspicion on someone who might be quite innocent.    When the morning came Miss Calista lost no time in setting out for  Kerrytown, where the money was soon safely deposited in the bank. She  heaved a sigh of relief when she left the building.    I feel as if I could enjoy life once more, she said to herself.  Goodness me, if I'd had to keep that money by me for a week itself,  I'd have been a raving lunatic by the end of it.    Miss Calista had shopping to do and friends to visit in town, so that  the dull autumn day was well nigh spent when she finally got back to  Cooperstown and paused at the corner store to get a bundle of matches.    The store was full of men, smoking and chatting around the fire, and  Miss Calista, whose pet abomination was tobacco smoke, was not at all  minded to wait any longer than she could help. But Abiram Fell was  attending to a previous customer, and Miss Calista sat grimly down by  the counter to wait her turn.    The door opened, letting in a swirl of raw November evening wind and  Ches Maybin. He nodded sullenly to Mr. Fell and passed down the store  to mutter a message to a man at the further end.    Miss Calista lifted her head as he passed and sniffed the air as a  charger who scents battle. The smell of tobacco was strong, and so was  that of the open boxes of dried herring on the counter, but plainly,  above all the commingled odours of a country grocery, Miss Calista  caught a whiff of peppermint, so strong as to leave no doubt of its  origin. There had been no hint of it before Ches Maybin's entrance.    The latter did not wait long. He was out and striding along the  shadowy road when Miss Calista left the store and drove smartly after  him. It never took Miss Calista long to make up her mind about  anything, and she had weighed and passed judgement on Ches Maybin's  case while Mr. Fell was doing up her matches.    The lad glanced up furtively as she checked her fat grey pony beside  him.    \"Good evening, Chester,\" she said with brisk kindness. \"I can give you  a lift, if you are going my way. Jump in, quick--Dapple is a little  restless.\"    A wave of crimson, duskily perceptible under his sunburned skin,  surged over Ches Maybin's face. It almost seemed as if he were going  to blurt out a blunt refusal. But Miss Calista's face was so guileless  and her tone so friendly, that he thought better of it and sprang in  beside her, and Dapple broke into an impatient trot down the long  hill lined with its bare, wind-writhen maples.    After a few minutes' silence Miss Calista turned to her moody  companion.    \"Chester,\" she said, as tranquilly as if about to ask him the most  ordinary question in the world, \"why did you climb into my house last  night and try to steal my money?\"    Ches Maybin started convulsively, as if he meant to spring from the  buggy at once, but Miss Calista's hand was on his arm in a grasp none  the less firm because of its gentleness, and there was a warning gleam  in her grey eyes.    \"It won't mend matters trying to get clear of me, Chester. I know it  was you and I want an answer--a truthful one, mind you--to my  question. I am your friend, and I am not going to harm you if you tell  me the truth.\"    Her clear and incisive gaze met and held irresistibly the boy's  wavering one. The sullen obstinacy of his face relaxed.    \"Well,\" he muttered finally, \"I was just desperate, that's why. I've  never done anything real bad in my life before, but people have always  been down on me. I'm blamed for everything, and nobody wants anything  to do with me. I'm willing to work, but I can't get a thing to do. I'm  in rags and I haven't a cent, and winter's coming on. I heard you  telling Mrs. Galloway yesterday about the money. I was behind the fir  hedge and you didn't see me. I went away and planned it all out. I'd  get in some way--and I meant to use the money to get away out west as  far from here as I could, and begin life there, where nobody knew me,  and where I'd have some sort of a chance. I've never had any here.  You can put me in jail now, if you like--they'll feed and clothe me  there, anyhow, and I'll be on a level with the rest.\"    The boy had blurted it all out sullenly and half-chokingly. A world of  rebellion and protest against the fate that had always dragged him  down was couched in his voice.    Miss Calista drew Dapple to a standstill before her gate.    \"I'm not going to send you to jail, Chester. I believe you've told me  the truth. Yesterday you wanted me to give you Caleb's place and I  refused. Well, I offer it to you now. If you'll come, I'll hire you,  and give you as good wages as I gave him.\"    Ches Maybin looked incredulous.    \"Miss Calista, you can't mean it.\"    \"I do mean it, every word. You say you have never had a chance. Well,  I am going to give you one--a chance to get on the right road and make  a man of yourself. Nobody shall ever know about last night's doings  from me, and I'll make it my business to forget them if you deserve  it. What do you say?\"    Ches lifted his head and looked her squarely in the face.    \"I'll come,\" he said huskily. \"It ain't no use to try and thank you,  Miss Calista. But I'll live my thanks.\"    And he did. The good people of Cooperstown held up their hands in  horror when they heard that Miss Calista had hired Ches Maybin, and  prophesied that the deluded woman would live to repent her rash step.  But not all prophecies come true. Miss Calista smiled serenely and  kept on her own misguided way. And Ches Maybin proved so efficient  and steady that the arrangement was continued, and in due time people  outlived their old suspicions and came to regard him as a thoroughly  smart and trustworthy young man.    \"Miss Calista has made a man of Ches Maybin,\" said the oracles. \"He  ought to be very grateful to her.\"    And he was. But only he and Miss Calista and the peppermint bottle  ever knew the precise extent of his gratitude, and they never told.          The Jest That Failed      \"I think it is simply a disgrace to have a person like that in our  class,\" said Edna Hayden in an injured tone.    \"And she doesn't seem a bit ashamed of it, either,\" said Agnes  Walters.    \"Rather proud of it, I should say,\" returned her roommate, spitefully.  \"It seems to me that if I were so poor that I had to 'room' myself and  dress as dowdily as she does that I really couldn't look anybody in  the face. What must the boys think of her? And if it wasn't for her"]]]
