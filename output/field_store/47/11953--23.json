[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3066"],[0,"The Red Man's Continent: A Chronicle of Aboriginal America (#18)"],[1,"Indians of the lower Columbia,  beyond the limits of the great northern archipelago, had large communal  houses occupied by three or four families of twenty or more individuals.  Their villages were thus fairly permanent, although there was much  moving about in summer owing to the nature of the food supply, which  consisted chiefly of salmon, with roots and berries indigenous to the  region. The people were noted as traders not only among themselves but  with surrounding tribes. They were extremely skillful in handling their  canoes, which were well made, hollowed out of single logs, and often  of great size. In disposition they are described as treacherous and  deceitful, especially when their cupidity was aroused. Slaves were  common and were usually obtained by barter from surrounding tribes,  though occasionally by successful raids. These Indians of Oregon by no  means rivaled the Haidas, for their food supply was less certain and  they did not have the advantage of easy water communication, which did  so much to raise the Haidas to a high level of development.    Of the tribes farther south an observer says: \"In general rudeness  of culture the California Indians are scarcely above the Eskimo, and  whereas the lack of development of the Eskimo on many sides of their  nature is reasonably attributable in part to their difficult and  limiting environment, the Indians of California inhabit a country  naturally as favorable, it would seem, as it might be. If the degree of  civilization attained by a people depends in any large measure on their  habitat, as does not seem likely, it might be concluded from the case of  the California Indians that natural advantages were an impediment rather  than an incentive to progress.\" In some of the tribes, such as the Hupa,  for example, there existed no organization and no formalities in the  government of the village. Formal councils were unknown, although the  chief might and often did ask advice of his men in a collected body. In  general the social structure of the California Indians was so simple  and loose that it is hardly correct to speak of their tribes. Whatever  solidarity there was among these people was due in part to family ties  and in part to the fact that they lived in the same village and spoke  the same dialect. Between different groups of these Indians, the common  bond was similarity of language as well as frequency and cordiality of  intercourse. In so primitive a condition of society there was neither  necessity nor opportunity for differences of rank. The influence of  chiefs was small and no distinct classes of slaves were known. Extreme  poverty was the chief cause of the low social and political organization  of these Indians. The Maidus in the Sacramento Valley were so poor that,  in addition to consuming every possible vegetable product, they not  only devoured all birds except the buzzard, but ate badgers, skunks,  wildcats, and mountain lions, and even consumed salmon bones and deer  vertebrae. They gathered grasshoppers and locusts by digging large  shallow pits in a meadow or flat. Then, setting fire to the grass on all  sides, they drove the insects into the pit. Their wings being burned off  by the flames, the grasshoppers were helpless and were thus collected  by the bushel. Again of the Moquelumne, one of the largest tribes in  central California, it is said that their houses were simply frameworks  of poles and brush which in winter were covered with earth. In summer  they erected cone-shaped lodges of poles among the mountains. In  favorable years they gathered large quantities of acorns, which formed  their principal food, and stored them for winter use in granaries raised  above the ground. Often, however, the crop was poor, and the Indians  were left on the verge of starvation.    Finally in the far south, in the peninsula of Lower California, the  tribes were \"probably the lowest in culture of any Indians in North  America, for their inhospitable environment which made them wanderers,  was unfavorable to the foundation of government even of the rude and  unstable kind found elsewhere.\" The Yuman tribes of the mountains east  of Santiago wore sandals of maguey fiber and descended from their own  territory among the mountains \"to eat calabash and other fruits\" that  grew beside the Colorado River. They were described as \"very dirty on  account of the much mescal they eat.\" Others speak of them as \"very  filthy in their habits. To overcome vermin they coat their heads with  mud with which they also paint their bodies. On a hot day it is by no  means unusual to see them wallowing in the mud like pigs.\" They were  \"exceedingly poor, having no animals except foxes of which they had  a few skins. The dress of the women in summer was a shirt and a bark  skirt. The men appear to have been practically unclothed during this  season. The practice of selling children seems to have been common.  Their sustenance was fish, fruits, vegetables, and seeds of grass,  and many of the tribes were said to have been dreadfully scorbutic.\"  A little to the east of these degraded savages the much more advanced  Mohave tribe had its home on the lower Colorado River. The contrast  between these neighboring tribes throws much light on the reason for the  low estate of the California Indians. \"No better example of the power  of environment to better man's condition can be found than that shown  as the lower Colorado is reached. Here are tribes of the same family (as  those of Lower California) remarkable not only for their fine physical  development, but living in settled villages with well-defined tribal  lines, practising a rude, but effective, agriculture, and well advanced  in many primitive Indian arts. The usual Indian staples were raised  except tobacco, these tribes preferring a wild tobacco of their region  to the cultivated.\" *          * Hodge, \"Handbook of American Indians.\"      This quotation is highly significant. With it should be compared the  fact that there is no evidence that corn or anything else was cultivated  in California west of the Rio Colorado Valley. California is a region  famous throughout America for its agriculture, but its crops are  European in origin. Even in the case of fruits, such as the grape,  which have American counterparts, the varieties actually cultivated were  brought from Europe. Wheat and barley, the chief foodstuffs for which  California and similar subtropical regions are noted, were unknown  in the New World before the coming of the white man. In pre-Columbian  America corn was the only cultivated cereal. The other great staples  of early American agriculture were beans and pumpkins. All three are  preeminently summer crops and need much water in July and August. In  California there is no rain at this season. Though the fall rains, which  begin to be abundant in October and November, do not aid these  summer crops, they favor wheat and barley. The winter rains and the  comparatively warm winter weather permit these grains to grow slowly but  continuously. When the warm spring arrives, there is still enough rain  to permit wheat and barley to make a rapid growth and to mature their  seeds long before the long, dry summer begins. The comparatively dry  weather of May and June is just what these cereals need to ripen the  crop, but it is fatal to any kind of agriculture which depends on summer  rain.    Crops can of course be grown during the summer in California by means of  irrigation, but this is rarely a simple process. If irrigation is to  be effective in California, it cannot depend on the small streams which  practically dry up during the long, rainless summer, but it must depend  on comparatively large streams which flow in well-defined channels. With  our modern knowledge and machinery it is easy for us to make canals and  ditches and to prepare the level fields needed to utilize this water. A  people with no knowledge of agriculture, however, and with no iron tools  cannot suddenly begin to practice a complex and highly developed system  of agriculture. In California there is little or none of the natural  summer irrigation which, in certain parts of America, appears to have  been the most important factor leading to the first steps in tilling the  ground. The lower Colorado, however, floods broad areas every summer.  Here, as on the Nile, the retiring floods leave the land so moist  that crops can easily be raised. Hence the Mohave Indians were able to  practice agriculture and to rise well above their kinsmen not only in  Lower California but throughout the whole State.    In the Rocky Mountain region of the United States, just as on the  Pacific coast, the condition of the tribes deteriorated more and more  the farther they lived to the south. In the regions where the rainfall  comes in summer, however, and hence favors primitive agriculture, there  was a marked improvement. The Kutenai tribes lived near the corner where  Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia now meet. They appear to have  been of rather high grade, noteworthy for their morality, kindness, and  hospitality. More than any other Indians of the Rocky Mountain region,  they avoided drunkenness and lewd intercourse with the whites. Their  mental ability was comparatively high, as appears from their skill in  buffalo-hunting, in making dugouts and bark canoes, and in constructing  sweat-houses and lodges of both skins and rushes. Even today the lower  Kutenai are noted for their water-tight baskets of split roots. Moreover  the degree to which they used the plants that grew about them for food,  medicine, and economical purposes was noteworthy. They also had an  esthetic appreciation of several plants and flowers--a gift rare among  Indians. These people lived in the zone of most stimulating climate and,  although they did not practice agriculture and had little else in their  surroundings to help them to rise above the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3069"],[0,"The Great Boer War (#18)"],[1," the army of Lucas Meyer,  and had afterwards by hard marching disengaged itself from the numerous  dangers which threatened it, its comrades at Ladysmith had loyally  co-operated in drawing off the attention of the enemy and keeping the  line of retreat open.    On October 20th--the same day as the Battle of Talana Hill--the line was  cut by the Boers at a point nearly midway between Dundee and Ladysmith.  A small body of horsemen were the forerunners of a considerable  commando, composed of Freestaters, Transvaalers, and Germans, who had  advanced into Natal through Botha's Pass under the command of General  Koch. They had with them the two Maxim-Nordenfelds which had been  captured from the Jameson raiders, and were now destined to return  once more to British hands. Colonel Schiel, the German artillerist, had  charge of these guns.    On the evening of that day General French, with a strong reconnoitering  party, including the Natal Carabineers, the 5th Lancers, and the 21st  battery, had defined the enemy's position. Next morning (the 21st) he  returned, but either the enemy had been reinforced during the night or  he had underrated them the day before, for the force which he took with  him was too weak for any serious attack. He had one battery of the Natal  artillery, with their little seven-pounder popguns, five squadrons  of the Imperial Horse, and, in the train which slowly accompanied his  advance, half a battalion of the Manchester Regiment. Elated by the news  of Talana Hill, and anxious to emulate their brothers of Dundee, the  little force moved out of Ladysmith in the early morning.    Some at least of the men were animated by feelings such as seldom find a  place in the breast of the British soldier as he marches into battle.  A sense of duty, a belief in the justice of his cause, a love for his  regiment and for his country, these are the common incentives of every  soldier. But to the men of the Imperial Light Horse, recruited as they  were from among the British refugees of the Rand, there was added a  burning sense of injustice, and in many cases a bitter hatred against  the men whose rule had weighed so heavily upon them. In this singular  corps the ranks were full of wealthy men and men of education, who,  driven from their peaceful vocations in Johannesburg, were bent upon  fighting their way back to them again. A most unmerited slur had been  cast upon their courage in connection with the Jameson raid--a slur  which they and other similar corps have washed out for ever in their own  blood and that of their enemy. Chisholm, a fiery little Lancer, was in  command, with Karri Davis and Wools-Sampson, the two stalwarts who had  preferred Pretoria Gaol to the favours of Kruger, as his majors. The  troopers were on fire at the news that a cartel had arrived in Ladysmith  the night before, purporting to come from the Johannesburg Boers and  Hollanders, asking what uniform the Light Horse wore, as they were  anxious to meet them in battle. These men were fellow townsmen and knew  each other well. They need not have troubled about the uniform, for  before evening the Light Horse were near enough for them to know their  faces.    It was about eight o'clock on a bright summer morning that the small  force came in contact with a few scattered Boer outposts, who retired,  firing, before the advance of the Imperial Light Horse. As they fell  back the green and white tents of the invaders came into view upon the  russet-coloured hillside of Elandslaagte. Down at the red brick railway  station the Boers could be seen swarming out of the buildings in which  they had spent the night. The little Natal guns, firing with obsolete  black powder, threw a few shells into the station, one of which, it  is said, penetrated a Boer ambulance which could not be seen by the  gunners. The accident was to be regretted, but as no patients could have  been in the ambulance the mischance was not a serious one.    But the busy, smoky little seven-pounder guns were soon to meet their  master. Away up on the distant hillside, a long thousand yards beyond  their own furthest range, there was a sudden bright flash. No smoke,  only the throb of flame, and then the long sibilant scream of the shell,  and the thud as it buried itself in the ground under a limber. Such  judgment of range would have delighted the most martinet of inspectors  at Okehampton. Bang came another, and another, and another, right  into the heart of the battery. The six little guns lay back at their  extremest angle, and all barked together in impotent fury. Another shell  pitched over them, and the officer in command lowered his field-glass in  despair as he saw his own shells bursting far short upon the hillside.  Jameson's defeat does not seem to have been due to any defect in his  artillery. French, peering and pondering, soon came to the  conclusion that there were too many Boers for him, and that if those  fifteen-pounders desired target practice they should find some other  mark than the Natal Field Artillery. A few curt orders, and his whole  force was making its way to the rear. There, out of range of those  perilous guns, they halted, the telegraph wire was cut, a telephone  attachment was made, and French whispered his troubles into the  sympathetic ear of Ladysmith. He did not whisper in vain. What he had  to say was that where he had expected a few hundred riflemen he found  something like two thousand, and that where he expected no guns he found  two very excellent ones. The reply was that by road and by rail as many  men as could be spared were on their way to join him.    Soon they began to drop in, those useful reinforcements--first the  Devons, quiet, business-like, reliable; then the Gordons, dashing,  fiery, brilliant. Two squadrons of the 5th Lancers, the 42nd R.F.A., the  21st R.F.A., another squadron of Lancers, a squadron of the 5th Dragoon  Guards--French began to feel that he was strong enough for the task in  front of him. He had a decided superiority of numbers and of guns. But  the others were on their favourite defensive on a hill. It would be a  fair fight and a deadly one.    It was late after noon before the advance began. It was hard, among  those billowing hills, to make out the exact limits of the enemy's  position. All that was certain was that they were there, and that  we meant having them out if it were humanly possible. 'The enemy are  there,' said Ian Hamilton to his infantry; 'I hope you will shift  them out before sunset--in fact I know you will.' The men cheered and  laughed. In long open lines they advanced across the veld, while the  thunder of the two batteries behind them told the Boer gunners that it  was their turn now to know what it was to be outmatched.    The idea was to take the position by a front and a flank attack, but  there seems to have been some difficulty in determining which was the  front and which the flank. In fact, it was only by trying that one  could know. General White with his staff had arrived from Ladysmith,  but refused to take the command out of French's hands. It is typical of  White's chivalrous spirit that within ten days he refused to identify  himself with a victory when it was within his right to do so, and took  the whole responsibility for a disaster at which he was not present.  Now he rode amid the shells and watched the able dispositions of his  lieutenant.    About half-past three the action had fairly begun. In front of the  advancing British there lay a rolling hill, topped by a further one. The  lower hill was not defended, and the infantry, breaking from column of  companies into open order, advanced over it. Beyond was a broad grassy  valley which led up to the main position, a long kopje flanked by a  small sugar-loaf one Behind the green slope which led to the ridge of  death an ominous and terrible cloud was driving up, casting its black  shadow over the combatants. There was the stillness which goes before  some great convulsion of nature. The men pressed on in silence, the soft  thudding of their feet and the rattle of their sidearms filling the air  with a low and continuous murmur. An additional solemnity was given to  the attack by that huge black cloud which hung before them.    The British guns had opened at a range of 4400 yards, and now against  the swarthy background there came the quick smokeless twinkle of the  Boer reply. It was an unequal fight, but gallantly sustained. A shot and  another to find the range; then a wreath of smoke from a bursting  shell exactly where the guns had been, followed by another and another.  Overmatched, the two Boer pieces relapsed into a sulky silence,  broken now and again by short spurts of frenzied activity. The British  batteries turned their attention away from them, and began to search the  ridge with shrapnel and prepare the way for the advancing infantry.    The scheme was that the Devonshires should hold the enemy in front while  the main attack from the left flank was carried out by the Gordons,  the Manchesters, and the Imperial Light Horse. The words 'front' and  'flank,' however, cease to have any meaning with so mobile and elastic  a force, and the attack which was intended to come from the left became  really a frontal one, while the Devons found themselves upon the right  flank of the Boers. At the moment of the final advance the great black  cloud had burst, and a torrent of rain lashed into the faces of the men.  Slipping and sliding upon the wet grass, they advanced to the assault.    And now amid the hissing of the rain there came the fuller, more  menacing whine of the Mauser bullets, and the ridge rattled from end to  end with the rifle fire. Men fell fast, but their comrades pressed  hotly on. There was a long way to go, for the summit of the position was  nearly 800 feet above the level of the railway. The hillside, which had  appeared to be one slope, was really a succession of undulations,"]]]
