To the milk dealer or distributor, bacteria are more or less of a  detriment. None of the organisms that find their way into milk, nor the  by-products formed by their growth, improve the quality of milk  supplies. It is therefore especially desirable from the milk-dealer's  point of view that these changes should be held in abeyance as much as  possible. Then too, the possibility that milk may serve as a medium for  the dissemination of disease-breeding bacteria makes it advisable to  protect this food supply from all possible infection from suspicious  sources.    In considering, therefore, the relation of bacteria to general milk  supplies, the _economic_ and the _hygienic_ standpoints must be taken  into consideration. Ordinarily much more emphasis is laid upon the first  requirement. If the supply presents no abnormal feature as to taste,  odor and appearance, unfortunately but little attention is paid to the  possibility of infection by disease germs. The methods of control which  are applicable to general milk supplies are based on the following  foundations: (1) the exclusion of all bacterial life, as far as  practicable, at the time the milk is drawn, and the subsequent storage  of the same at temperatures unfavorable for the growth of the organisms  that do gain access; (2) the removal of the bacteria, wholly or in part,  after they have once gained access.    Until within comparatively recent years, practically no attention was  given to the character of milk supplies, except possibly as to the  percentage of butter fat, and sometimes the milk solids which it  contained. So long as the product could be placed in the hands of the  consumer in such shape as not to be rejected by him as unfit for food,  no further attention was likely to be given to its character. At  present, however, much more emphasis is being given to the quality of  milk, especially as to its germ content; and the milk dealer is  beginning to recognize the necessity of a greater degree of control.  This control must not merely concern the handling of the product after  it reaches him, but should go back to the milk producer on the farm.  Here especially, it is necessary to inculcate those methods of  cleanliness which will prevent in large measure the wholesale infection  that ordinarily occurs.    The two watch words which are of the utmost importance to the milk  dealer are _cleanliness_ and _cold_. If the milk is properly drawn from  the animal in a clean manner and is immediately and thoroughly chilled,  the dealer has little to fear as to his product. Whenever serious  difficulties do arise, attributable to bacterial changes, it is because  negligence has been permitted in one or both directions. The influence  of cleanliness in diminishing the bacterial life in milk and that of low  temperatures in repressing the growth of those forms which inevitably  gain access has been fully dealt with in preceding chapters. It is of  course not practicable to take all of these precautions to which  reference has been made in the securing of large supplies of market milk  for city use, but great improvement over existing conditions could be  secured if the public would demand a better supervision of this  important food article. Boards of health in our larger cities are  awakening to the importance of this question and are becoming  increasingly active in the matter of better regulations and the  enforcement of the same.    New York City Board of Health has taken an advanced position in  requiring that all milk sold in the city shall be chilled down to 45 deg.  F. immediately after milking and shall be transported to the city in  refrigerator cars.    Reference has already been made to the application of the acid test  (page 52) in the inspection of city milk supplies, and it is the opinion  of the writer that the curd test (see page 76) could also be used with  advantage in determining the sanitary character of milk. This test  reveals the presence of bacteria usually associated with dirt and  permits of the recognition of milks that have been carelessly handled.  From personal knowledge of examinations made of the milk supplies in a  number of Wisconsin cities it appears that this test could be utilized  with evident advantage.    ~\"Sanitary\" or \"certified\" milk supplies.~ In a number of the larger  cities, the attempt has been made to improve the quality of the milk  supplies by the installation of dairies in which is produced an  especially high grade of milk. Frequently the inspection of the dairy as  well as the examination of the milk at stated intervals is under the  control of milk commissions or medical societies and as it is customary  to distribute the certificate of the examining board with the product,  such milks are frequently known as \"certified.\" In such dairies the  tuberculin test is used at regular intervals, and the herd inspected  frequently by competent veterinarians. The methods of control  inaugurated as to clean milking and subsequent handling are such as to  insure the diminution of the bacteria to the lowest possible point. The  bacterial limit set by the Pediatric Society of Philadelphia is 10,000  organisms per cc. Often it is possible to improve very materially on  this standard and not infrequently is the supply produced where it  contains only a few thousand organisms per cc. Where such a degree of  care is exercised, naturally a considerably higher price must be paid  for the product,[126] and it should be remembered that the development  of such a system is only possible in relatively large centers where the  dealer can cater to a selected high-class trade. Moreover, it should  also be borne in mind that such a method of control is only feasible in  dairies that are under individual control. The impossibility of  exercising adequate control with reference to the milking process and  the care which should be given the milk immediately thereafter, when the  same is produced on different farms under various auspices is evident.      PRESERVATION OF MILK SUPPLIES.    While much can be done to improve the quality of milk supplies by  excluding a large proportion of the bacteria which normally gain access  to the milk, and preventing the rapid growth of those that do find their  way therein, yet for general municipal purposes, any practical method of  preservation[127] that is applicable on a commercial scale must rest  largely upon the destruction of bacteria that are present in the milk.    The two possible methods by which bacteria can be destroyed after they  have once gained access is (1) by the use of chemical preservatives; (2)  by the aid of physical methods.    ~Chemical preservatives.~ Numerous attempts have been made to find some  chemical substance that could be added to milk which would preserve it  without interfering with its nutritive properties, but as a general rule  a substance that is toxic enough to destroy or inhibit the growth of  bacterial life exerts a prejudicial effect on the tissues of the body.  The use of chemicals, such as carbolic acid, mercury salts and mineral  acids, that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27785"],[0,"A Book About Lawyers (#18)"],[1," why should I interpose?\" In his old age,  when she was dead, he visited his estate in Durham, but could not  find heart to cross the Tyne bridge and look at the old house from  which he took her in the bloom and tenderness of her girlhood. An  urgent invitation to visit Newcastle drew from him the reply--\"I  know my fellow-townsmen complain of my not coming to see them; but  _how can I pass that bridge?_\" After a pause, he added, \"Poor Bessie!  if ever there was an angel on earth she was one. The only reparation  which one man can make to another for running away with his daughter,  is to be exemplary in his conduct towards her.\"    In pecuniary affairs not less prudent than his brother, Lord Stowell in  matters of sentiment was capable of indiscretion. In the long list of  legal loves there are not many episodes more truly ridiculous than the  story of the older Scott's second marriage. On April 10, 1813, the  decorous Sir William Scott, and Louisa Catharine, widow of John,  Marquis of Sligo, and daughter of Admiral Lord Howe, were united in the  bonds of holy wedlock, to the infinite amusement of the world of  fashion, and to the speedy humiliation of the bridegroom. So incensed  was Lord Eldon at his brother's folly, that he refused to appear at the  wedding; and certainly the Chancellor's displeasure was not without  reason, for the notorious absurdity of the affair brought ridicule on  the whole of the Scott family connexion. The happy couple met for the  first time in the Old Bailey, when Sir William Scott and Lord  Ellenborough presided at the trial of the marchioness's son, the young  Marquis of Sligo, who had incurred the anger of the law by luring into  his yacht, in Mediterranean waters, two of the king's seamen. Throughout  the hearing of that _cause celebre_, the marchioness sat in the fetid  court of the Old Bailey, in the hope that her presence might rouse  amongst the jury or in the bench feelings favorable to her son. This  hope was disappointed. The verdict having been given against the young  peer, he was ordered to pay a fine of L5000, and undergo four months'  incarceration in Newgate, and--worse than fine and imprisonment--was  compelled to listen to a parental address from Sir William Scott on the  duties and responsibilities of men of high station. Either under the  influence of sincere admiration for the judge, or impelled by desire for  vengeance on the man who had presumed to lecture her son in a court of  justice, the marchioness wrote a few hasty words of thanks to Sir  William Scott for his salutary exhortation to her boy. She even went so  far as to say that she wished the erring marquis could always have so  wise a counsellor at his side. This communication was made upon a slip  of paper, which the writer sent to the judge by an usher of the court.  Sir William read the note as he sat on the bench, and having looked  towards the fair scribe, he received from her a glance and smile that  were fruitful of much misery to him. Within four months the courteous  Sir William Scott was tied fast to a beautiful, shrill, voluble  termagant, who exercised marvellous ingenuity in rendering him wretched  and contemptible. Reared in a stately school of old-world politeness,  the unhappy man was a model of decorum and urbanity. He took reasonable  pride in the perfection of his tone and manner; and the  marchioness--whose malice did not lack cleverness--was never more happy  than when she was gravely expostulating with him, in the presence of  numerous auditors, on his lamentable want of style, tact, and  gentlemanlike bearing. It is said that, like Coke and Holt under similar  circumstances, Sir William preferred the quietude of his chambers to the  society of an unruly wife, and that in the cellar of his Inn he sought  compensation for the indignities and sufferings which he endured at  home. Fifty years since the crusted port of the Middle Temple could  soothe the heart at night, without paining the head in the morning.          PART III.    MONEY.          CHAPTER XII.    FEES TO COUNSEL.      From time immemorial popular satire has been equally ready to fix the  shame of avarice upon Divinity Physic, and Law; and it cannot be denied  that in this matter the sarcasms of the multitude are often sustained by  the indisputable evidence of history. The greed of the clergy for tithes  and dues is not more widely proverbial than the doctor's thirst for  fees, or the advocate's readiness to support injustice for the sake of  gain. Of Guyllyam of Horseley, physician to Charles VI. of France,  Froissart says, \"All his dayes he was one of the greatest nygardes that  ever was;\" and the chronicler adds, \"With this rodde lightly all  physicians are beaten.\" In his address to the sergeants who were called  soon after his elevation to the Marble Chair, the Lord Keeper Puckering,  directing attention to the grasping habits which too frequently  disgraced the leaders of the bar, observed: \"I am to exhort you also not  to embrace multitude of causes, or to undertake more places of hearing  causes than you are well able to consider of or perform, lest thereby  you either disappoint your clients when their causes be heard, or come  unprovided, or depart when their causes be in hearing. For it is all  one not to come, as either to come unprovided, or depart before it be  ended.\" Notwithstanding Lingard's able defence of the Cardinal, scholars  are still generally of opinion that Beaufort--the Chancellor who lent  money on the king's crown, the bishop who sold the Pope's soldiers for a  thousand marks--is a notable instance of the union of legal covetousness  and ecclesiastical greed.    The many causes which affect the value of money in different ages create  infinite perplexity for the antiquarian who wishes to estimate the  prosperity of the bar in past times; but the few disjointed data, that  can be gathered from old records, create an impression that in the  fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the ordinary fees of  eminent counsel were by no means exorbitant, although fortunate  practitioners could make large incomes.    Dugdale's 'Baronage' describes with delightful quaintness William de  Beauchamp's interview with his lawyers when that noble (on the death of  John Hastings, Earl of Pembroke, _temp._ Richard II., without issue),  claimed the earl's estates under an entail, in opposition to Edward  Hastings, the earl's heir-male of the half-blood. \"Beauchamp,\" says  Dugdale, \"invited his learned counsel to his house in Paternoster Row,  in the City of London; amongst whom were Robert Charlton (then a judge),  William Pinchbek, William Branchesley, and John Catesby (all learned  lawyers); and after dinner, coming out of his chapel, in an angry mood,  threw to each of them a piece of gold, and said, 'Sirs, I desire you  forthwith to tell me whether I have any right or title to Hastings'  lordship and lands.' Whereupon Pinchbek stood up (the rest being silent,  fearing that he suspected them), and said, 'No man here nor in England  dare say that you have any right in them, except Hastings do quit his  claim therein; and should he do it, being now under age, it would be of  no validitie.'\" Had Charlton, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas,  taken gold for his opinion on a case put before him in his judicial  character, he would have violated his judicial oath. But in the earl's  house in Paternoster Row he was merely a counsellor learned in the law,  not a judge. Manifest perils attend a system which permits a judge in  his private character to give legal opinions concerning causes on which  he may be required to give judgment from the bench; but notwithstanding  those perils, there is no reason for thinking that Charlton on this  occasion either broke law or etiquette. The fair inference from the  matter is, that in the closing years of the fourteenth century judges  were permitted to give opinions for money to their private clients,  although they were forbidden to take gold or silver from any person  having \"plea or process hanging before them.\"    In the year of our Lord 1500 the corporation of Canterbury paid for  advice regarding their civic interests 3_s._ 4_d._ to each of three  sergeants, and gave the Recorder of London 6_s._ 8_d._ as a  retaining-fee. Five years later, Mr. Serjeant Wood received a fee of  10_s._ from the Goldsmiths' Company; and it maybe fairly assumed, that  so important and wealthy a body paid the sergeant on a liberal scale. In  the sixteenth century it was, and for several generations had been,  customary for clients to provide food and drink for their counsel. Mr.  Foss gives his readers the following list of items, taken from a bill of  costs, made in the reign of Edward IV.:--                                                          _s._  _d._  For a breakfast at Westminster spent on our counsel     1    6    To another time for boat-hire in and out, and a    breakfast for two days                                1    6    In like manner the accountant of St. Margaret's, Westminster, entered in  the parish books, \"Also, paid to Roger Fylpott, learned in the law, for  his counsel given, 3_s._ 8_d._, with 4_d._ for his dinner.\"    A yet more remarkable custom was that which enabled clients to hire  counsel to plead for them at certain places, for a given time, in  whatever causes their eloquence might be required. There still exists  the record of an agreement by which, in the reign of Henry VII.,  Sergeant Yaxley bound himself to attend the assizes at York, Nottingham  and Derby, and speak in court at each of those places, whenever his  client, Sir Robert Plumpton--\"that perpetual and always unfortunate  litigant,\" as he is called by Sergeant Manning--required him to do so.  This interesting document runs thus--\"This bill, indented at London the  18th day of July, the 16th yeare of the reigne of King Henry the 7th,  witnesseth that John Yaxley, Sergeant-at-Law,"]]]
