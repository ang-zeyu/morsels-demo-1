[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3003"],[0,"Wild Flowers (#18)"],[1,"- Moist rocks, uplands.  Flowering Season - June-September.  Distribution - Arctic regions of Europe, Asia, and America;  southward on this continent, through Canada to New Jersey and  Pennsylvania; westward to Nebraska, to Arizona in the Rockies,  and to California in the Sierra Nevadas.    The inaccessible crevice of a precipice, moist rocks sprayed with  the dashing waters of a lake or some tumbling mountain stream,  wind-swept upland meadows, and shady places by the roadside may  hold bright bunches of these hardy bells, swaying with exquisite  grace on tremulous, hair-like stems that are fitted to withstand  the fiercest mountain blasts, however frail they appear. How  dainty, slender, tempting these little flowers are! One gladly  risks a watery grave or broken bones to bring down a bunch from  its aerial cranny.    It was a long stride forward in the evolutionary scale when the  harebell welded its five once separate petals together; first at  the base, then farther and farther up the sides, until a solid  bell-shaped structure resulted. This arrangement which makes  insect fertilization a more certain process because none of the  pollen is lost through apertures, and because the visitor must  enter the flower only at the vital point where the stigmas come  in contact with his pollen-laden body, has given to all the  flowers that have attained to it, marked ascendency.    Like most inverted blossoms, the harebell hangs its head to  protect its nectar and pollen, not only from rain, but from the  intrusion of undesirable crawling insects which would simply  brush off its pollen in the grass before reaching the pistil of  another flower, and so defeat cross-fertilization, the end and  aim of so many blossoms. Advertising for winged insects by its  bright color, the harebell attracts bees, butterflies, and many  others. These visitors cannot well walk on the upright petals,  and sooner or later must clasp the pistil if they would secure  the nectar secreted at the base. In doing so, they will dust  themselves and the immature pistil with the pollen from the  surrounding anthers; but a newly opened flower is incapable of  fertilization. The pollen, although partially discharged in the  unopened bud, is prevented from falling out by a coat of hairs on  the upper part of the style. By the time all the pollen has been  removed by visitors, however, and the stamens which matured early  have withered, the pistil has grown longer, until it looks like  the clapper in a bell; the stigma at its top has separated into  three horizontal lobes which, being sticky on the under side, a  pollen-laden insect on entering the bell must certainly brush  against them and render them fertile. But bumblebees, its chief  benefactors, and others may not have done their duty by the  flower; what then? Why, the stigmas in that case finally bend  backward to reach the left over pollen, and fertilize themselves,  obviously the next best thing for them to do. How one's reverence  increases when one begins to understand, be it ever so little of,  the divine plan!    \"Probably the most striking blue and purple wild flowers we  have,\" says John Burroughs, \"are of European origin. These  colors, except with the fall asters and gentians, seem rather  unstable in our flora.\" This theory is certainly borne out in the  case of the RAMPION, EUROPEAN, or CREEPING BELLFLOWER (C.  rapunculoides), now detected in the act of escaping from gardens  from New Brunswick to Ontario, Southern New York, Pennsylvania,  and Ohio, and making itself very much at home in our fields and  along the waysides. Compared with the delicate little harebell,  it is a plant of rank, rigid habit. Its erect, rather stout stem,  set with elongated oval, hairy, alternate leaves, and crowned  with a one-sided raceme of widely expanded, purple-blue bells  rising about two feet above the ground, has little of the  exquisite grace of its cousin. It blooms from July to September.  This is the species whose roots are eaten by the omnivorous  European peasant.    One of the few native campanulas, the TALL BELLFLOWER (C.  Americana), waves long, slender wands studded with blue or  sometimes whitish flowers high above the ground of moist thickets  and woods throughout the eastern half of this country, but rarely  near the sea. Doubtless the salt air, which intensifies the color  of so many flowers, would brighten its rather slatey blue. The  corolla, which is flat, round, about an inch across, and deeply  cleft into five pointed petals, has the effect of a miniature  pinwheel in motion. Mature flowers have the style elongated, bent  downward, then curved upward, that the stigmas may certainly be  in the way of the visiting insect pollen-laden from an earlier  bloomer, and be cross-fertilized. The larger bees, its  benefactors, which visit it for nectar, touch only the upper side  of the style, on which they must alight; but the anthers waste  pollen by shedding it on all sides. No insect can take shelter  from rain or pass the night in this flower, as he frequently does  in its more hospitable relative, the harebell. English gardeners,  more appreciative than our own of our native flora, frequently  utilize this charming plant in their rockwork, increasing their  stock by a division of the dense, leafy rosettes.      VENUS' LOOKING-GLASS; CLASPING BELLFLOWER    (Legouzia perfoliata; Specularia perfoliata of Gray)  Bellflower family    Flowers - Violet blue, from 1/2 to 3/4 in. across; solitary or 2  or 3 together, seated, in axils of upper leaves. Calyx lobes  varying from 3 to 5 in earlier and later flowers, acute, rigid;  corolla a 5-spoked wheel; 5 stamens; pistil with 3 stigmas. Stem:  6 in. to 2 ft. long, hairy, densely leafy, slender, weak. Leaves:  Round, clasped about stem by heart-shaped base.  Preferred Habitat - Sterile waste places, dry woods.  Flowering Season - May-September.  Distribution - From British Columbia, Oregon, and Mexico, east to  Atlantic Ocean.    At the top of a gradually lengthened and apparently overburdened  leafy stalk, weakly leaning upon surrounding vegetation, a few  perfect blossoms spread their violet wheels, while below them  insignificant earlier flowers, which, although they have never  opened, nor reared their heads above the hollows of the little  shell-like leaves where they lie secluded, have, nevertheless,  been producing seed without imported pollen while their showy  sisters slept. But the later blooms, by attracting insects, set  cross-fertilized seed to counteract any evil tendencies that  might weaken the species if it depended upon self-fertilization  only. When the European Venus' looking-glass used to be  cultivated in gardens here, our grandmothers tell us it was  altogether too prolific, crowding out of existence its less  fruitful, but more lovely, neighbors.    The SMALL VENUS' LOOKING-GLASS (L. biflora), of similar habit to  the preceding, but with egg-shaped or oblong leaves seated on,  not clasping, its smooth and very slender stem, grows in the  South and westward to California.      GREAT LOBELIA; BLUE CARDINAL-FLOWER    (Lobelia syphilitica)  Bellflower family    Flowers - Bright blue, touched with white, fading to pale blue,  about 1 in. long, borne on tall, erect, leafy spike. Calyx  5-parted, the lobes sharply cut, hairy. Corolla tubular, open to  base on one side, 2-lipped, irregularly 5-lobed, the petals  pronounced at maturity only. Stamens 5, united by their hairy  anthers into a tube around the style; larger anthers smooth.  Stem: 1 to 3 ft. high, stout, simple, leafy, slightly hairy.  Leaves: Alternate, oblong, tapering, pointed, irregularly  toothed, 2 to 6 in. long, 1/2 to 2 in. wide.  Preferred Habitat - Moist or wet soil; beside streams.  Flowering Season - July-October  Distribution - Ontario and northern United States west to Dakota,  south to Kansas and Georgia.    To the evolutionist, ever on the lookout for connecting links,  the lobelias form an interesting group, because their corolla,  slit down the upper side and somewhat flattened, shows the  beginning of the tendency toward the strap or ray flowers that  are nearly confined to the composites of much later development,  of course, than tubular single blossoms. Next to massing their  flowers in showy heads, as the composites do, the lobelias have  the almost equally advantageous plan of crowding theirs along a  stem so as to make a conspicuous advertisement to attract the  passing bee and to offer him the special inducement of numerous  feeding places close together.    The handsome GREAT LOBELIA, constantly and invidiously compared  with its gorgeous sister the cardinal flower, suffers unfairly.  When asked what his favorite color was, Eugene Field replied:  \"Why, I like any color at all so long as it's red!\" Most men, at  least, agree with him, and certainly hummingbirds do; our  scarcity of red flowers being due, we must believe, to the  scarcity of hummingbirds, which chiefly fertilize them. But how  bees love the blue blossoms!    There are many cases where the pistil of a flower necessarily  comes in contact with its own pollen, yet fertilization does not  take place, however improbable this may appear. Most orchids, for  example, are not susceptible to their own pollen. It would seem  as if our lobelia, in elevating its stigma through the ring  formed by the united anthers, must come in contact with some of  the pollen they have previously discharged from their tips, not  only on the bumblebee that shakes it out of them when he jars the  flower, but also within the tube. But when the anthers are  mature, the two lobes of the still immature stigma are pressed  together, and cannot be fertilized. Nevertheless, the hairy tips  of some of the anthers brush off the pollen grains that may have  lodged on the stigma as it passes through the ring in its ascent,  thus making surety doubly sure. Only after the stigma projects  beyond the ring "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30047"],[0,"Aircraft and Submarines (#18)"],[1,"was at their own cost, both in  time and money. In France, whither they went in 1908, they had no  coldness to complain of. It was then the golden day of aviation in  the land which always afforded to the Knights of the Air their  warmest welcome and their most liberal support. Two years had  elapsed since Santos-Dumont, turning from dirigibles to 'planes, had  made a flight of 238 yards. This the Wrights had at the time  excelled at home but without attracting attention. France on the  contrary went mad with enthusiasm, and claimed for the Brazilian the  honour of first demonstrating the possibility of flight in a  heavier-than-air machine. England, like the United States, was cold,  clinging to the balloon long after all other nations had abandoned  it. But France welcomed the Wrights with enthusiasm. They found  rivals a-plenty in their field of effort. Santos-Dumont, Bleriot,  Farman, Latham were all flying with airplanes, but with models  radically different from that of the American brothers. Nevertheless  the latter made an instant success.    [Illustration: Permission of _Scientific American_.    _The Comparative Strength of Belligerents in Airplanes at the  Opening of the War._    _The French Army had at least 500 aeroplanes. England had about 250  aeroplanes of all types Russia had 50 aeroplanes--Austria had at  least 50 aeroplanes Germany is about the equal of France, having 500  flyers._]    From the moment they found that they had hit upon the secret of  raising, supporting, and propelling an airplane, the Wrights made of  their profession a matter of cold business. In many ways this was  the best contribution they could possibly have made to the science  of aviation, though their keen eye to the main chance did bring down  on them a certain amount of ridicule. Europe laughed long at the  _sang-froid_ with which Wilbur Wright, having won the Michelin prize  of eight hundred pounds, gave no heed to the applause which the  assembled throng gave him as the money was transferred to him with a  neat presentation speech. Without a word he divided the notes into  two packets, handed one to his brother Orville, and thrust the other  into his own pocket. For the glory which attended his achievement he  cared nothing. It was all in the day's work. Later in the course of  trials of a machine for the United States Government at Fort Myer,  just across the Potomac from Washington, the Wrights seriously  offended a certain sort of public sentiment in a way which  undoubtedly set back the encouragement of aviation by the United  States Government very seriously.    [Illustration: Permission of _Scientific American_.    _The Comparative Strength of Belligerents in Dirigibles at the  Opening of the War._    _France must be credited with at least eighteen airships of various  types--England had only seven--Russia had probably not more than  three airships available--Belgium had one airship Austria had not  less than three, not more than five airships available--Germany had  twenty three airships of the rigid, semi-rigid, and non-rigid  type._]    In 1909, they had received a contract from the government for a  machine for the use of the Signal Service. The price was fixed at  $25,000, but a bonus of $2500 was to be paid for every mile above  forty miles an hour made by the machine on its trial trip. That  bonus looked big to the Wrights, but it cost the cause of aviation  many times its face value in the congressional disfavour it caused.  Aviation was then in its infancy in the United States. Every man in  Congress wanted to see the flights. But Fort Myer, whose parade was  to be the testing ground, was fully fourteen miles from the Capitol,  and reached only most inconveniently from Washington by trolley, or  most expensively by carriage or automobile. Day after day members  of the House and Senate made the long journey across the Potomac.  Time and again they journeyed back without even a sight of the  flyer in the hangar. One after another little flaws discovered in  the machine led the aviators to postpone their flight. Investigating  statesmen who thought that their position justified them in seeking  special privileges were brusquely turned away by the military guard.  The dusk of many a summer's night saw thousands of disappointed  sightseers tramping the long road back to Washington. The climax  came when on a clear but breezy day Wilbur Wright announced that the  machine was in perfect condition and could meet its tests readily,  but that in order to win a bigger bonus, he would postpone the  flight for a day with less wind. All over Washington the threat was  heard that night that Congress would vote no more money for  aviation, and whether or not the incident was the cause, the  sequence was that the American Congress was, until the menace of war  with Germany in 1916, the most niggardly of all legislative bodies  in its treatment of the flying corps. When the Wrights did finally  fly they made a triumphant flight before twelve thousand spectators.  The test involved crossing the Potomac, going down its north side to  Alexandria, and then back to Fort Myer. Ringing cheers and the  crashing strains of the military band greeted the return of the  aviator, but oblivious to the enthusiasm Wilbur Wright stood beside  his machine with pencil and pad computing his bonus. It figured up  to five thousand dollars, and the reporters chronicled that the  Wrights knew well the difference between solid coin and the bubble  of reputation.    [Illustration: Wright Glider.]    But this seemingly cold indifference to fame and single-minded  concentration on the business of flying on the part of the Wrights  was in fact of the utmost value to aviation as an art and a science.  They were pioneers and successful ones. Their example was heeded by  others in the business. In every way they sought to discourage that  wild reaching after public favour and notoriety that led aviators to  attempt reckless feats, and often sacrifice their lives in a foolish  effort to astonish an audience. No one ever heard of either of the  Wright brothers \"looping-the-loop,\" doing a \"demon glide,\" or in any  other fashion reducing the profession of aviation to the level of a  circus. In a time when brave and skilful aviators, with a mistaken  idea of the ethics of their calling, were appealing to sensation  lovers by the practice of dare-devil feats, the Wrights with  admirable common sense and dignity stood sturdily against any such  degradation of the aviator's art. In this position they were joined  by Glenn Curtis, and the influence of the three was beginning to be  shown in the reduced number of lives sacrificed in these follies  when the Great War broke upon the world and gave to aviation its  greatest opportunity. The world will hope nevertheless that after  that war shall end the effort to adapt the airplane to the ends of  peace will be no less earnest and persistent than have been the  methods by which it has been made a most serviceable auxiliary of  war.    In July, 1915, _Collier's Weekly_ published an interview with  Orville Wright in which that man, ordinarily of few words, set up  some interesting theories upon the future of airplanes.         \"The greatest use of the airplane to date,\" said Mr. Wright, \"has       been as a tremendously big factor of modern warfare. But--         \"The greatest use of the airplane eventually will be to prevent       war.         \"Some day there will be neither war nor rumours of war, and the       reason may be flying machines.         \"It sounds paradoxical. We are building airplanes to use in time       of war, and will continue to build them for war. We think of war       and we think of airplanes. Later on, perhaps, we shall think of       airplanes in connection with the wisdom of keeping out of war.         \"The airplane will prevent war by making it too expensive, too       slow, too difficult, too long drawn out--in brief, by making the       cost prohibitive.         \"Did you ever stop to think,\" inquires Wright, \"that there is a       very definite reason why the present war in Europe has dragged       along for a year with neither side gaining much advantage over       the other? The reason as I figure it out is airplanes. In       consequence of the scouting work done by the flying machines each       side knows exactly what the opposing forces are doing.         \"There is little chance for one army to take another by surprise.       Napoleon won his wars by massing his troops at unexpected places.       The airplane has made that impossible. It has equalized       information. Each side has such complete knowledge of the other's       movements that both sides are obliged to crawl into trenches and       fight by means of slow, tedious routine, rather than by quick,       spectacular dashes.         \"My impression is that before the present war started the army       experts expected it to be a matter of a few weeks, or at the       most, a few months. To-day it looks as if it might run into years       before one side can dictate terms. Now, a nation that may be       willing to undertake a war lasting a few months may well hesitate       about engaging in one that will occupy years. The daily cost of a       great war is of course stupendous. When this cost runs on for       years the total is likely to be so great that the side which wins       nevertheless loses. War will become prohibitively expensive. The       scouting work in flying machines will be the predominating       factor, as it seems to me, in bringing this about. I like to       think so anyhow.\"         \"What, in your opinion, has the present war demonstrated       regarding the relative advantages of airplanes and Zeppelin       airships?\" the inventor was asked.         \"The airplane seems to have been of the more practical use,\"       replied Wright. \"In the first place, dirigible airships of the"]]]
