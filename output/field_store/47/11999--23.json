Spurning the mob who had rushed in at him, he  strode towards his risen adversary, and aimed at him one final blow that  should put an end to his tyranny for ever. A notion that Sarah Purfoy  had betrayed him, and that the handsome soldier was the cause of  the betrayal, had taken possession of his mind, and his rage had  concentrated itself upon Maurice Frere. The aspect of the villain was so  appalling, that, despite his natural courage, Frere, seeing the backward  sweep of the cutlass, absolutely closed his eyes with terror, and  surrendered himself to his fate.    As Gabbett balanced himself for the blow, the ship, which had been  rocking gently on a dull and silent sea, suddenly lurched--the convict  lost his balance, swayed, and fell. Ere he could rise he was pinioned by  twenty hands.    Authority was almost instantaneously triumphant on the upper and lower  decks. The mutiny was over.          CHAPTER XI. DISCOVERIES AND CONFESSIONS.        The shock was felt all through the vessel, and Pine, who had been  watching the ironing of the last of the mutineers, at once divined its  cause.    \"Thank God!\" he cried, \"there's a breeze at last!\" and as the  overpowered Gabbett, bruised, bleeding, and bound, was dragged down the  hatchway, the triumphant doctor hurried upon deck to find the  Malabar plunging through the whitening water under the influence of a  fifteen-knot breeze.    \"Stand by to reef topsails! Away aloft, men, and furl the royals!\" cries  Best from the quarter-deck; and in the midst of the cheery confusion  Maurice Frere briefly recapitulated what had taken place, taking  care, however, to pass over his own dereliction of duty as rapidly as  possible.    Pine knit his brows. \"Do you think that she was in the plot?\" he asked.    \"Not she!\" says Frere--eager to avert inquiry. \"How should she be? Plot!  She's sickening of fever, or I'm much mistaken.\"    Sure enough, on opening the door of the cabin, they found Sarah Purfoy  lying where she had fallen a quarter of an hour before. The clashing of  cutlasses and the firing of muskets had not roused her.    \"We must make a sick-bay somewhere,\" says Pine, looking at the senseless  figure with no kindly glance; \"though I don't think she's likely to be  very bad. Confound her! I believe that she's the cause of all this. I'll  find out, too, before many hours are over; for I've told those fellows  that unless they confess all about it before to-morrow morning, I'll get  them six dozen a-piece the day after we anchor in Hobart Town. I've a  great mind to do it before we get there. Take her head, Frere, and we'll  get her out of this before Vickers comes up. What a fool you are, to be  sure! I knew what it would be with women aboard ship. I wonder Mrs. V.  hasn't been out before now. There--steady past the door. Why, man, one  would think you never had your arm round a girl's waist before! Pooh!  don't look so scared--I won't tell. Make haste, now, before that little  parson comes. Parsons are regular old women to chatter\"; and thus  muttering Pine assisted to carry Mrs. Vickers's maid into her cabin.    \"By George, but she's a fine girl!\" he said, viewing the inanimate body  with the professional eye of a surgeon. \"I don't wonder at you making  a fool of yourself. Chances are, you've caught the fever, though this  breeze will help to blow it out of us, please God. That old jackass,  Blunt, too!--he ought to be ashamed of himself, at his age!\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked Frere hastily, as he heard a step approach.  \"What has Blunt to say about her?\"    \"Oh, I don't know,\" returned Pine. \"He was smitten too, that's all. Like  a good many more, in fact.\"    \"A good many more!\" repeated the other, with a pretence of carelessness.    \"Yes!\" laughed Pine. \"Why, man, she was making eyes at every man in the  ship! I caught her kissing a soldier once.\"    Maurice Frere's cheeks grew hot. The experienced profligate had been  taken in, deceived, perhaps laughed at. All the time he had flattered  himself that he was fascinating the black-eyed maid, the black-eyed  maid had been twisting him round her finger, and perhaps imitating his  love-making for the gratification of her soldier-lover. It was not a  pleasant thought; and yet, strange to say, the idea of Sarah's treachery  did not make him dislike her. There is a sort of love--if love it can be  called--which thrives under ill-treatment. Nevertheless, he cursed with  some appearance of disgust.    Vickers met them at the door. \"Pine, Blunt has the fever. Mr. Best found  him in his cabin groaning. Come and look at him.\"    The commander of the Malabar was lying on his bunk in the betwisted  condition into which men who sleep in their clothes contrive to get  themselves. The doctor shook him, bent down over him, and then loosened  his collar. \"He's not sick,\" he said; \"he's drunk! Blunt! wake up!  Blunt!\"    But the mass refused to move.    \"Hallo!\" says Pine, smelling at the broken tumbler, \"what's this? Smells  queer. Rum? No. Eh! Laudanum! By George, he's been hocussed!\"    \"Nonsense!\"    \"I see it,\" slapping his thigh. \"It's that infernal woman! She's  drugged him, and meant to do the same for\"--(Frere gave him an imploring  look)--\"for anybody else who would be fool enough to let her do it.  Dawes was right, sir. She's in it; I'll swear she's in it.\"    \"What! my wife's maid? Nonsense!\" said Vickers.    \"Nonsense!\" echoed Frere.    \"It's no nonsense. That soldier who was shot, what's his name?--Miles,  he--but, however, it doesn't matter. It's all over now.\" \"The men will  confess before morning,\" says Vickers, \"and we'll see.\" And he went off  to his wife's cabin.    His wife opened the door for him. She had been sitting by the child's  bedside, listening to the firing, and waiting for her husband's return  without a murmur. Flirt, fribble, and shrew as she was, Julia Vickers  had displayed, in times of emergency, that glowing courage which women  of her nature at times possess. Though she would yawn over any book  above the level of a genteel love story; attempt to fascinate, with  ludicrous assumption of girlishness, boys young enough to be her sons;  shudder at a frog, and scream at a spider, she could sit throughout a  quarter of an hour of such suspense as she had just undergone with as  much courage as if she had been the strongest-minded woman that ever  denied her sex. \"Is it all over?\" she asked.    \"Yes, thank God!\" said Vickers, pausing on the threshold. \"All is safe  now, though we had a narrow escape, I believe. How's Sylvia?\" The child  was lying on the bed with her fair hair scattered over the pillow, and  her tiny hands moving restlessly to and fro.    \"A little better, I think, though she has been talking a good deal.\"    The red lips parted, and the blue eyes, brighter than ever, stared  vacantly around. The sound of her father's voice seemed to have roused  her, for she began to speak a little prayer: \"God bless papa and mamma,  and God bless all on board this ship. God bless me, and make me a good  girl, for Jesus Christ's sake, our Lord. Amen.\"    The sound of the unconscious child's simple prayer had something awesome  in it, and John Vickers, who, not ten minutes before, would have sealed  his own death warrant unhesitatingly to preserve the safety of the  vessel, felt his eyes fill with unwonted tears. The contrast was  curious. From out the midst of that desolate ocean--in a fever-smitten  prison ship, leagues from land, surrounded by ruffians, thieves, and  murderers, the baby voice of an innocent child called confidently on  Heaven.                *          *          *          *          *      Two hours afterwards--as the Malabar, escaped from the peril which had  menaced her, plunged cheerily through the rippling water--the mutineers,  by the spokesman, Mr. James Vetch, confessed.    \"They were very sorry, and hoped that their breach of discipline would  be forgiven. It was the fear of the typhus which had driven them to it.  They had no accomplices either in the prison or out of it, but they felt  it but right to say that the man who had planned the mutiny was Rufus  Dawes.\"    The malignant cripple had guessed from whom the information which  had led to the failure of the plot had been derived, and this was his  characteristic revenge.          CHAPTER XII. A NEWSPAPER PARAGRAPH.        Extracted from the Hobart Town Courier of the 12th November, 1827:--    \"The examination of the prisoners who were concerned in the attempt upon  the Malabar was concluded on Tuesday last. The four ringleaders, Dawes  Gabbett, Vetch, and Sanders, were condemned to death; but we understand  that, by the clemency of his Excellency the Governor, their sentence  has been commuted to six years at the penal settlement of Macquarie  Harbour.\"        END OF BOOK THE FIRST              BOOK II.--MACQUARIE HARBOUR. 1833.              CHAPTER I. THE TOPOGRAPHY OF VAN DIEMEN'S LAND.        The south-east coast of Van Diemen's Land, from the solitary Mewstone to  the basaltic cliffs of Tasman's Head, from Tasman's Head to Cape Pillar,  and from Cape Pillar to the rugged grandeur of Pirates' Bay, resembles  a biscuit at which rats have been nibbling. Eaten away by the continual  action of the ocean which, pouring round by east and west, has divided  the peninsula from the mainland of the Australasian continent--and done  for Van Diemen's Land what it has done for the Isle of Wight--the shore  line is broken and ragged. Viewed upon the map, the fantastic fragments  of island and promontory which lie scattered between the South-West Cape  and the greater Swan Port, are like the curious forms assumed by melted  lead"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34259"],[0,"Hunting Dogs (#18)"],[1,"explorers these  consist mostly of canvas collar like attachments made of fourfold  strips, two of which pass or slip over the critter's back, the other  two between the forelegs, the whole united to a trace and this in  turn fastened by a toggle, hook or ring to the sledge or drag rope.  The dogs are hitched to this, either side of the drag, or alternately  single or double, distant a few feet from each other. The guiding dog  or leader is ahead leading while the others follow. Where canvas  harness or steel wire rope is used on the drag by \"Expeditions\" it is  because it lessens the chances of the harness being stolen, chewed or  eaten, when rations become scarce.    In heavy traveling they are used and hitched double for fast travel,  alternate and single as exigencies require and will travel from 10 to  50 miles a day according to conditions of road, load, snow, ice, etc.  When hitched or prior to it, they are usually lightly fed so as to  bring them to reach their destination and \"Tether,\" loafers soon  learn that they must earn their food. At times when worked hard, they  get off feed, so to speak, sulk and refuse to come up to a drag. In  which case the remaining dogs must do the work and rarely do they  fail to whine, show their contempt for such action and punish \"His  Nibs\" at the first chance later on, even pining to get at him, sled  and all, as they observe him following behind alone.    On hard pulls, or uneven drags, they play out easily, act mulish,  refusing to budge until the sled is started or at variance with each  other. Otherwise, the start is a steady pull until well under way. A  good team double will pull easily a load of 1,000 pounds or more,  single about one-half, depending largely on condition of themselves  and the road they travel. The Esquimaux seldom spares them or the  whip, \"Brring\" them on and \"Hi-ying\" if needs be.    About eight hours' work constitutes a day's travel or they go until  played out, the latter case most likely. When traveling they are  fairly obedient and preserve a steady equal pulling that occasionally  is relieved by a jerky, gallop-like pace. Well trained dogs preserve  their pace and tug on the harness for hours at a time. Usually they  stop every hour or so for breathing spells as the atmosphere in those  regions winds them easily. If traveling fast on ice and one falls or  slips, he is dragged along, half strangled, until he regains his  feet, place and position in line again, or, becoming tangled he is  loosened up. By this time he has been snapped a few times by the dogs  about him as if to punish him for his carelessness.    Ordinarily, the leader responds promptly to the driver's voice,  guiding, turning, halting or increasing speed at the given command.  When, however, they scent game, they become difficult to manage,  requiring utmost application of the whip to keep the trail or  direction and this invariably ends in confusion, hopeless tangle and  upset sledge.    Handling, feeding, training calls for more judgment and patience than  skill, driving especially. They refuse to cross apparently weak yet  tested ice, pressure ridges, ice or snow cracks and mule-like, will  make a plunging jump over a depression (when in trace) which  ordinarily would not call for a leap at all. They require  watchfulness on the part of the driver over cross country or when not  following the trail, lest they sheer off from a given direction or  straight line.      [Illustration: Sledge Dog.--Photo From Life.]    When following the trail much confidence is vested in the leader and  should perchance it strike a blind or cross trail, it will howl to  attract the attention of the driver and by these means verify  directions, as if to ask if it is leading right. In case it loses the  track it will slow up, whine, run up or criss-cross its tracks,  sniffing and smelling in an anxious, expectant way, until it finds or  is led correct, when it howls with delight and pulls off \"like  blazes\" again.    They have strange likes and dislikes. As entire pack will punish one  who incurs the displeasure at times to an extent of crippling or  killing each other. If a strange dog comes amongst them he is pretty  sure to get \"mauled\" or his scraping abilities put to test, which  usually ends in a free-for-all fight, catch as catch can rules  predominating.    When in harness training a young dog gets punished frequently by its  mates for any awkwardness it shows. Old dogs especially show contempt  for a new or strange dog which takes its mate's place, be it pup or  otherwise, and will often sulk if their place is changed. Each seems  to think his place is best, the leader especially being particularly  proud of his honored position in \"Dogdom.\" As a rule, existing  difficulties or arguments in harness are stored up until that day's  march is over, because of fear of punishment from the driver, but as  soon as turned loose, they settle the difficulty of the day by  another scrap, in which often one bunch will participate in, \"take  sides,\" and chew up each other, until all pitch in, aiming to settle  things somehow. If too tired, they await the morrow. As a rule, the  best sledge dogs are the poorest scrappers (so we have to be partial  at times) especially to the leader who is usually the most  intelligent; hence favored.    In a pinch, when game and rations are scarce, they make good eating,  of course, being sacrificed. At these times, their peculiar savage  nature asserts itself, when you kill one for food, by signs of joy,  rather than fear for they seem to be devoid of sympathy or unaffected  by the scene. Their flesh is pale, tender and tasteless much like  rabbit, bloodless and poor, and they will eat anything from a tin can  label to Kipling's \"Rag, Bone or Hank of Hair.\" When meat is plenty,  they take on flesh and fatten quickly but seldom does this happen as  the Esquimaux says, \"Him no good, lazy, much fat.\"    Wolf-like, stolen food tastes better and one will leave his own  ration to steal a fellow's equal share and risking by his greediness  both, as it is stolen in turn by another. Their thieving propensities  are great, a tin can of meat, skin boots, oil lamp, old soup kettle,  or their own harness if sealskin or rawhide.      [Illustration: Rough and Ready Sledge Dog.]    Tied, penned up or left harnessed any length of time, they assert  their belief in \"Liberty and Equality\" by chewing their way to  freedom if it takes a week to do it. As a rule, the dogs respect a  female and will seldom molest her. These give birth to a litter of  from 4 to 8 pups which are generally killed at birth, unless a  scarcity of them, fat \"puppy dog\" being with the paunch of the  reindeer considered a regular \"Delmonico\" dish. The average  usefulness of their existence is about 6 to 8 years, the old dogs  following the same road as fat puppies, after their usefulness has  seen the limit. Fall bred dogs are best. Alaskan dogs are larger and  heavier and the same rule applies to Labrador species, but as they  are of mixed breed, lazier and require more food they are only used  to advantage where they belong--at home.    As a rule, they exist, breed and sleep in the open, the soft side of  a drifting snow bank being a luxury, especially if it drifts about  them up to the muzzle, and it is only vacated when dangerous. They  seek the warmest spots they can find, a rope coil, rag or paper, or  even a tin can to lie on, in preference to ice or hard snow. Failing  in this, they will dig a hole in the soft snow and bury themselves in  this, lying one on top of the other in bitter weather. The best of  Arctic or Polar dogs, while they withstand cold to surprising degree,  nevertheless, suffer with the cold and danger of freezing, especially  in winter time when food is scarce or frozen and snow serves to  quench thirst, a wet foot or crippled limb being the first to suffer.  In bitter weather I have seen them roll and run to maintain  circulation. They huddle together, shivering, hold up their paws and  whine pitifully and appealingly.    They receive a kind word by a show of teeth instead of a wag--indeed,  are anything but friendly, except at \"chuck\" time and then limit it  to the grub with a few exceptions, of course. Most of them, however,  Indian-like, believe in the old maxim \"Familiarity breeds contempt\"  and thus they treat kindness with suspicion and turn tail as if it  preceded work or a licking and perhaps both.    If left alone any length of time, one will start up a coyote-like  howl and all join in one after the other in the chorus that takes the  appearance of a man with a \"big stick\" to quell. If left alone they  will keep it up for hours, stopping as it commenced by degrees,  apparently without reason. They are fed when circumstances permit and  if permitted, will gorge themselves to the point of bursting, eating  enough to last a week and camping alongside of it until even the  bones are cleaned up and not enough left to feed a fly. Indian-like,  however, they are always on hand for the next meal, hungry again.  When traveling, they are fed a little daily, but when not, exist on  wind, bones and kicks, fish offal and refuse thrown out, or hunt for  themselves like wolves, after Arctic hares, lemmings or anything they  can find.    In winter time, dogs are often the main food of the Esquimaux and as  fat or oil is generally scarce, are eaten raw instead of cooked, oil  being too valuable at this time to be wasted on dog. Its taste to the  white man largely depends on one's hunger or digestive cravings. If  half-starved, it is voted \"just excellent.\" If not, it is \"just dog,\"  that's all. Yet, if the pangs of hunger gnaw one's vitals,  repugnance, position in life, creed, superstition, opinions, likes  and dislikes, self-respect, all give way to the cravings of an empty  stomach; especially in that trackless great white desert called the  \"Distant Polar Regions.\"    Such is the"]]]
