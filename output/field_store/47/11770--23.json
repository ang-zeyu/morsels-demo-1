He was accidentally  drowned in the Annapolis River some time in 1650.  French Canadian  writers call him cruel, vindictive, rapacious, and arbitrary, but he  has never been the favourite of historians.  His plans of settlement  had a sound basis and might have led to a prosperous and populous  Acadia, had he not wrecked them by the malignity with which he followed  La Tour and his wife.    {106}    La Tour, in the year 1648, visited Quebec, where he was received with  the most gratifying demonstrations of respect by his countrymen, who  admired his conduct in the Acadian struggle.  Then D'Aunay died and La  Tour immediately went to France, where the government acknowledged the  injustice with which it had treated him in the past, and appointed him  governor of Acadia, with enlarged privileges and powers.  In 1653 he  married D'Aunay's widow, Jeanne de Motin, in the hope--to quote the  contract--\"to secure the peace and tranquillity of the country, and  concord and union between the two families.\"  Peace then reigned for  some months in Acadia; many new settlers came into the country, the  forts were strengthened, and the people were hoping for an era of  prosperity.  But there was to be no peace or rest for the French in  Acadia.    One of D'Aunay's creditors in France, named Le Borgne, came to America  in 1654 at the head of a large force, with the object of obtaining  possession of D'Aunay's property, and possibly of his position in  Acadia.  He made a prisoner of Denys, who was at that time engaged in  trade in Cape Breton, and treated him with great harshness.  After a  short imprisonment at Port Royal, which was occupied by Le Borgne,  Denys was allowed to go to France, where he succeeded eventually in  obtaining a redress of his grievances, and an appointment as governor  of Cape Breton.    Whilst Le Borgne was preparing to attack La Tour, the English appeared  on the scene of action.  By this time the civil war had been fought in  {107} England, the King beheaded, and Cromwell proclaimed Lord  Protector of the Commonwealth.  In 1653 very strong representations  were made to the latter by the colonists of New England with respect to  the movements of the French in Acadia, and the necessity of reducing  the country to the dominion of England.  Peace then nominally prevailed  between France and Great Britain, but we have seen, as the case of  Argall proved, that matters in America were often arranged without much  reference to international obligations.  A fleet, which had been sent  out by Cromwell to operate against the Dutch colony at Manhattan,  arrived at Boston in June, 1654, and the news came a few days later  that peace had been proclaimed between the English and Dutch.  Thereupon an expedition was organised against the French under the  command of Major Robert Sedgewick of Massachusetts.  Le Borgne at Port  Royal and La Tour on the St. John immediately surrendered to this  force, and in a few days all Acadia was once more in the hands of the  English.  Denys was almost ruined by these events and obliged to retire  for a time from the country.  La Tour was now far advanced in years,  and did not attempt to resist the evil destiny that seemed to follow  all the efforts of France to establish herself in Nova Scotia.  No  doubt the injuries he had received from his own countrymen, together  with the apathy which the French Government always displayed in the  affairs of Acadia, were strong arguments, if any were needed, to induce  him to place himself under the protection of the English.  The  representations he {108} made to the Protector met with a favourable  response, and obtained for him letters patent, dated August 9, 1656,  granting to him, Sir Charles La Tour, in conjunction with Sir Thomas  Temple and William Crowne, the whole territory of Acadia, the mines and  minerals alone being reserved for the government.  Sir Thomas Temple, a  man of generous disposition and remarkably free from religious  prejudices, subsequently purchased La Tour's rights, and carried on a  large trade in Acadia with much energy.  La Tour now disappears from  the scene, and is understood to have died in the country he loved in  the year 1666, at the ripe age of seventy-four.  He left several  descendants, none of whom played a prominent part in Acadian history,  though there are persons still in the maritime provinces of Canada who  claim a connection with his family.  His name clings to the little  harbour near Cape Sable, where he built his post of Lomeron, and  antiquaries now alone fight over the site of the more famous fort at  the mouth of the St. John, where a large and enterprising city has  grown up since the English occupation.  About the figure of this bold  gentleman-adventurer the romance of history has cast a veil of interest  and generous appreciation on account of the devotion of his wife and of  the obstinate fight he waged under tremendous disadvantages against a  wealthy rival, supported by the authority of France.  He was made of  the same material as those brave men of the west coast of England who  fought and robbed the Spaniard in the Spanish Main, but as he plundered  only Puritans by giving them worthier {109} mortgages, and fought only  in the Acadian wilds, history has given him a relatively small space in  its pages.    Acadia remained in possession of England until the Treaty of Breda,  which was concluded in July of 1667, between Charles II. and Louis XIV.  Temple, who had invested his fortune in the country, was nearly ruined,  and never received any compensation for his efforts to develop Acadia.  In a later chapter, when we continue the chequered history of Acadia,  we shall see that her fortunes from this time become more closely  connected with those of the greater and more favoured colony of France  in the valley of the St. Lawrence.        [1] See _Trans. Roy. Soc. Canada_, vol. x., sec. 2, p. 93.    [2] This story of the capture of Fort La Tour rests on the authority of  Denys (Description Geographique et Historique de l'Amerique  Septentrionale, Paris, 1672), who was in Acadia at the time and must  have had an account from eyewitnesses of the tragedy.  The details  which make D'Aunay so cruel and relentless are denied by a Mr. Moreau  in his _Histoire de l'Acadie Francaise_ (Paris, 1873).  This book is  confessedly written at the dictation of living members of the D'Aunay  family, and is, from the beginning to the end, an undiscriminating  eulogy of D'Aunay and an uncompromising attack on the memory of La Tour  and his wife.  He attempts to deny that the fort was seized by  treachery, when on another page he has gone so far as to accuse some  Recollets of having made, at the instigation of D'Aunay himself, an  attempt to win the garrison from Madame La Tour who was a Protestant  and disliked by the priests.  He also admits that a number of the  defenders of the fort were executed, while others, probably the  traitors, had their lives spared.  The attacks on Madame La Tour's  character are not warranted by impartial history, and clearly show the  bias of the book.          {110}    VIII.    THE CANADIAN INDIANS AND THE IROQUOIS:    THEIR ORGANISATION, CHARACTER, AND CUSTOMS.    At the time of Champlain's death we see gathering in America the forces  that were to influence the fortunes of French Canada--the English  colonies growing up by the side of the Atlantic and the Iroquois, those  dangerous foes, already irritated by the founder of Quebec.  These  Indians were able to buy firearms and ammunition from the Dutch traders  at Fort Orange, now Albany, on the beautiful river which had been  discovered by Hudson in 1609.  From their warlike qualities and their  strong natural position between the Hudson and Niagara rivers, they had  now become most important factors in the early development of the  French and English colonies, and it is consequently important to give  some particulars of their character and organisation.  In the first  place, however, I shall refer to those Indian tribes who lived in  Canada, and were closely identified with the interests of the French  settlements.  These Indians also became possessed of {112} firearms,  sold to them from time to time by greedy traders, despite the interdict  of the French authorities in the early days of the colonies.    [Illustration: Indian costumes, from Lafitau.  1. Iroquois; 2.  Algonquin.]    Champlain found no traces of the Indians of Cartier's time at Stadacona  and Hochelaga.  The tribes which had frequented the St. Lawrence  seventy years before had vanished, and in their place he saw bands of  wandering Algonquins.  It was only when he reached the shores of  Georgian Bay that he came to Indian villages resembling that Hochelaga  which had disappeared so mysteriously.  The St. Lawrence in Cartier's  day had been frequented by tribes speaking one or more of the dialects  of the Huron-Iroquois family, one of the seven great families that then  inhabited North America east of the Mississippi, from the Gulf of  Mexico to the Hudson's Bay.  The short and imperfect vocabulary of  Indian words which Cartier left behind, his account of Hochelaga, the  intimacy of the two Gaspe Indians with the inhabitants of  Stadacona--these and other facts go to show that the barbarous tribes  he met were of the Iroquois stock.    The Indians have never had any written records, in the European sense,  to perpetuate the doings of their nations or tribes.  From generation  to generation, from century to century, however, tradition has told of  the deeds of ancestors, and given us vague stories of the origin and  history of the tribes.  It is only in this folk-lore--proved often on  patient investigation to be of historic value--that we can find some  threads to guide us through the labyrinth of mystery to which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22566"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#18)"],[1,"the folks in Oz, when  you get acquainted. What time is it, Mr. Wizard?\"    The little man looked at his watch--a big silver one that he carried in  his vest pocket.    \"Half-past three,\" he said.    \"Then we must wait for half an hour,\" she continued; \"but it won't take  long, after that, to carry us all to the Emerald City.\"    They sat silently thinking for a time. Then Jim suddenly asked:    \"Are there any horses in Oz?\"    \"Only one,\" replied Dorothy, \"and he's a sawhorse.\"    \"A what?\"    \"A sawhorse. Princess Ozma once brought him to life with a witch-powder,  when she was a boy.\"    \"Was Ozma once a boy?\" asked Zeb, wonderingly.    \"Yes; a wicked witch enchanted her, so she could not rule her kingdom.  But she's a girl now, and the sweetest, loveliest girl in all the  world.\"    \"A sawhorse is a thing they saw boards on,\" remarked Jim, with a sniff.    \"It is when it's not alive,\" acknowledged the girl. \"But this sawhorse  can trot as fast as you can, Jim; and he's very wise, too.\"    \"Pah! I'll race the miserable wooden donkey any day in the week!\" cried  the cab-horse.    Dorothy did not reply to that. She felt that Jim would know more about  the Saw-Horse later on.    The time dragged wearily enough to the eager watchers, but finally the  Wizard announced that four o'clock had arrived, and Dorothy caught up  the kitten and began to make the signal that had been agreed upon to the  far-away, invisible Ozma.    \"Nothing seems to happen,\" said Zeb, doubtfully.    \"Oh, we must give Ozma time to put on the Magic Belt,\" replied the girl.    She had scarcely spoken the words when she suddenly disappeared from the  cave, and with her went the kitten. There had been no sound of any kind  and no warning. One moment Dorothy sat beside them with the kitten in  her lap, and a moment later the horse, the piglets, the Wizard and the  boy were all that remained in the underground prison.    [Illustration: DOROTHY MADE THE SIGNAL.]    \"I believe we will soon follow her,\" announced the Wizard, in a tone of  great relief; \"for I know something about the magic of the fairyland  that is called the Land of Oz. Let us be ready, for we may be sent for  any minute.\"    He put the piglets safely away in his pocket again and then he and Zeb  got into the buggy and sat expectantly upon the seat.    \"Will it hurt?\" asked the boy, in a voice that trembled a little.    \"Not at all,\" replied the Wizard. \"It will all happen as quick as a  wink.\"    And that was the way it did happen.    The cab-horse gave a nervous start and Zeb began to rub his eyes to make  sure he was not asleep. For they were in the streets of a beautiful  emerald-green city, bathed in a grateful green light that was especially  pleasing to their eyes, and surrounded by merry faced people in gorgeous  green-and-gold costumes of many extraordinary designs.    Before them were the jewel-studded gates of a magnificent palace, and  now the gates opened slowly as if inviting them to enter the courtyard,  where splendid flowers were blooming and pretty fountains shot their  silvery sprays into the air.    Zeb shook the reins to rouse the cab-horse from his stupor of amazement,  for the people were beginning to gather around and stare at the  strangers.    \"Gid-dap!\" cried the boy, and at the word Jim slowly trotted into the  courtyard and drew the buggy along the jewelled driveway to the great  entrance of the royal palace.    [Illustration]        CHAPTER 15.    OLD FRIENDS ARE REUNITED      Many servants dressed in handsome uniforms stood ready to welcome the  new arrivals, and when the Wizard got out of the buggy a pretty girl in  a green gown cried out in surprise:    \"Why, it's Oz, the Wonderful Wizard, come back again!\"    The little man looked at her closely and then took both the maiden's  hands in his and shook them cordially.    \"On my word,\" he exclaimed, \"it's little Jellia Jamb--as pert and pretty  as ever!\"    \"Why not, Mr. Wizard?\" asked Jellia, bowing low. \"But I'm afraid you  cannot rule the Emerald City, as you used to, because we now have a  beautiful Princess whom everyone loves dearly.\"    \"And the people will not willingly part with her,\" added a tall soldier  in a Captain-General's uniform.    The Wizard turned to look at him.    \"Did you not wear green whiskers at one time?\" he asked.    \"Yes,\" said the soldier; \"but I shaved them off long ago, and since then  I have risen from a private to be the Chief General of the Royal  Armies.\"    \"That's nice,\" said the little man. \"But I assure you, my good people,  that I do not wish to rule the Emerald City,\" he added, earnestly.    \"In that case you are very welcome!\" cried all the servants, and it  pleased the Wizard to note the respect with which the royal retainers  bowed before him. His fame had not been forgotten in the Land of Oz, by  any means.    \"Where is Dorothy?\" enquired Zeb, anxiously, as he left the buggy and  stood beside his friend the little Wizard.    \"She is with the Princess Ozma, in the private rooms of the palace,\"  replied Jellia Jamb. \"But she has ordered me to make you welcome and to  show you to your apartments.\"    The boy looked around him with wondering eyes. Such magnificence and  wealth as was displayed in this palace was more than he had ever dreamed  of, and he could scarcely believe that all the gorgeous glitter was real  and not tinsel.    \"What's to become of me?\" asked the horse, uneasily. He had seen  considerable of life in the cities in his younger days, and knew that  this regal palace was no place for him.    It perplexed even Jellia Jamb, for a time, to know what to do with the  animal. The green maiden was much astonished at the sight of so unusual  a creature, for horses were unknown in this Land; but those who lived in  the Emerald City were apt to be astonished by queer sights, so after  inspecting the cab-horse and noting the mild look in his big eyes the  girl decided not to be afraid of him.    \"There are no stables here,\" said the Wizard, \"unless some have been  built since I went away.\"    \"We have never needed them before,\" answered Jellia; \"for the Sawhorse  lives in a room of the palace, being much smaller and more natural in  appearance than this great beast you have brought with you.\"    \"Do you mean that I'm a freak?\" asked Jim, angrily.    \"Oh, no,\" she hastened to say, \"there may be many more like you in the  place you came from, but in Oz any horse but a Sawhorse is unusual.\"    This mollified Jim a little, and after some thought the green maiden  decided to give the cab-horse a room in the palace, such a big building  having many rooms that were seldom in use.    So Zeb unharnessed Jim, and several of the servants then led the horse  around to the rear, where they selected a nice large apartment that he  could have all to himself.    Then Jellia said to the Wizard:    \"Your own room--which was back of the great Throne Room--has been vacant  ever since you left us. Would you like it again?\"    \"Yes, indeed!\" returned the little man. \"It will seem like being at home  again, for I lived in that room for many, many years.\"    He knew the way to it, and a servant followed him, carrying his satchel.  Zeb was also escorted to a room--so grand and beautiful that he almost  feared to sit in the chairs or lie upon the bed, lest he might dim their  splendor. In the closets he discovered many fancy costumes of rich  velvets and brocades, and one of the attendants told him to dress  himself in any of the clothes that pleased him and to be prepared to  dine with the Princess and Dorothy in an hour's time.    Opening from the chamber was a fine bath-room having a marble tub with  perfumed water; so the boy, still dazed by the novelty of his  surroundings, indulged in a good bath and then selected a maroon velvet  costume with silver buttons to replace his own soiled and much worn  clothing. There were silk stockings and soft leather slippers with  diamond buckles to accompany his new costume, and when he was fully  dressed Zeb looked much more dignified and imposing than ever before in  his life.    He was all ready when an attendant came to escort him to the presence of  the Princess; he followed bashfully and was ushered into a room more  dainty and attractive than it was splendid. Here he found Dorothy seated  beside a young girl so marvelously beautiful that the boy stopped  suddenly with a gasp of admiration.    But Dorothy sprang up and ran to seize her friend's hand, drawing him  impulsively toward the lovely Princess, who smiled most graciously upon  her guest. Then the Wizard entered, and his presence relieved the boy's  embarrassment. The little man was clothed in black velvet, with many  sparkling emerald ornaments decorating his breast; but his bald head and  wrinkled features made him appear more amusing than impressive.    Ozma had been quite curious to meet the famous man who had built the  Emerald City and united the Munchkins, Gillikins, Quadlings and Winkies  into one people; so when they were all four seated at the dinner table  the Princess said:    \"Please tell me, Mr. Wizard, whether you called yourself Oz after this  great country, or whether you believe my country is called Oz after you.  It is a matter that I have long wished to enquire about, because you are  of a strange race and my own name is Ozma. No one, I am sure, is better  able to explain this mystery than you.\"    \"That is true,\" answered the little Wizard; \"therefore it will give me  pleasure to explain my connection with your country. In the first place,  I must tell you that I was born in Omaha, and my father, who was a  politician, named me Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkle  Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs, Diggs being the last name because he could  think of no more to go before it.
