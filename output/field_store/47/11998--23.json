This is so  smooth and so well lubricated, that the intestines have the utmost freedom  of motion. In the small intestines, the work of digestion is completed, the  large intestine receiving from them the indigestible residue of the food,  and in time expelling it from the body.    [Sidenote: 33. The presence of food in the intestines? Bile?]    33. INTESTINAL DIGESTION.--As soon as the food passes the pylorus and  begins to accumulate in the upper {95} part of the intestines, it excites  the flow of a new digestive fluid, which enters through a small tube, or  _duct_, about three inches below the stomach. It is formed by the union of  two distinct fluids--the _bile_ and the _pancreatic_ juice. The bile is  secreted by the liver, which is the largest gland of the body, and is  situated on the right side and upper part of the abdomen (Fig. 22). The  bile is constantly formed, but it flows most rapidly during digestion.  During the intervals of digestion it is stored in the _gall-bladder_, a  small membranous bag attached to the under side of the liver. This fluid is  of a greenish-yellow color, having a peculiar smell, and a very bitter  taste.    [Sidenote: 34. The pancreatic juice? The joint action of these fluids?]    34. The pancreatic juice is the product of a gland called the _pancreas_,  situated behind the stomach. This fluid is colorless, viscid, and without  odor. Like the digestive juices previously described, it owes its solvent  power to its peculiar ferment principle, called _pancreatin_. By the joint  action of these fluids, the fatty parts of the food are prepared for  absorption. By previous steps of digestion the fats are merely separated  from the other components of the food; but here, within the intestines,  they are reduced to a state of minute division, or _emulsion_, resembling  the condition of butter in milk, before it has been churned. There results  from this action a white and milky fluid, termed the _chyle_, which holds  in solution the digestible portions of the food, and is spread over the  extensive absorbent surface of the small intestines.    [Sidenote: 35. The mucous membrane? Experiments on inferior animals?]    35. The mucous membrane of the intestines, also, secretes or produces, a  digestive fluid by means of numerous \"follicles,\" or minute glands; this is  called the intestinal juice. From experiments on the inferior animals, it  has been ascertained that this fluid exerts a solvent influence over each  of the three organic food principles, and in this way may supplement and  complete the action of the {96} fluids previously mentioned, viz.:--of the  saliva in converting starch into sugar, of the gastric juice in digesting  the albuminoids, and of the pancreatic juice and bile in emulsifying the  fats.    [Sidenote: 36, 37. How much thus far has been done with the food? The next  process? Give the first way.]    36. ABSORPTION.--With the elaboration of the chyle, the work of digestion  is completed; but, in a certain sense, the food is yet outside of the body;  that is, the blood is not yet enriched by it, and it is not in a position  to nourish the tissues. The process by which the liquefied food passes out  of the alimentary canal into the blood is called absorption. This is  accomplished in two ways; first, by the _blood-vessels_. We have seen how  the inner membrane of the stomach is underlaid by a tracery of minute and  numerous vessels, and how some portions of the food are by them absorbed.  The supply of blood-vessels to the intestines is even greater; particularly  to the small intestines, where the work of absorption is more actively  carried on.    37. The absorbing surface of the small intestines, if considered as a plane  surface, amounts to not less than half a square yard. Besides, the mucous  membrane is formed in folds with an immense number of thread-like  prolongations, called _villi_, which indefinitely multiply its absorbing  capacity. These minute processes, the villi, give the surface the  appearance and smoothness of velvet; and during digestion, they dip into  the canal, and, by means of their blood-vessels, absorb its fluid contents,  just as the _spongioles_ which terminate the rootlets of plants, imbibe  moisture from the surrounding soil.    [Sidenote: 38. How is absorption effected in another way? Describe it. Name  of the lacteals? Thoracic duct?]    38. Secondly, absorption is also effected by the _lacteals_, a set of  vessels peculiar to the small intestines. These have their beginnings in  the little villi just mentioned, side by side with the blood-vessels. These  two sets of absorbents run in different courses, but their destination is  the same, {97} which is the right side of the heart. The lacteals receive  their name from their milky-white appearance. After a meal containing a  portion of fat, they are then distended with chyle, which they are  specially adapted to receive: at other times they are hardly discernible.  The lacteals all unite to form one tube, the _thoracic duct_, which passes  upward through the _thorax_, or chest, and empties into a large vein,  situated just beneath the left collar-bone.    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--THE LACTEALS.    A, Small Intestine. B, Lacteals. C, Thoracic Duct. D, Absorbents.  E, Blood-vessel. ]    [Sidenote: 39. The absorbents? Lymph? What further of the lymph?]    39. THE ABSORBENTS.--The lacteals belong to a class of vessels known as  absorbents, or lymphatics, which ramify in nearly all parts of the body,  except the brain and spinal cord. The fluid which circulates through the  lymphatics of the limbs, and all the organs not concerned in digestion, is  called _lymph_. This fluid is clear and colorless, like water, and thus  differs from the milky chyle which the lacteals carry after digestion: it  consists chiefly of the watery part of the blood, which was not required by  the tissues, and is returned to the blood by the absorbents or lymphatics.    [Sidenote: 40. What can you state as to the time required for digestion?]    40. CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING DIGESTION.--What length of time is required for  the digestion of food? From observations made, in the case of St. Martin,  the Canadian {98} already referred to, it has been ascertained that, at the  end of two hours after a meal, the stomach is ordinarily empty. How much  time is needed to complete the digestion of food, within the small  intestines, is not certain; but, from what we have learned respecting their  functions, it must be evident that it largely depends upon the amount of  starch and fat which the food contains.    [Sidenote: 41. Circumstances affecting duration of digestion? Fresh food?]    41. In addition to the preparations which the food undergoes in cooking,  which we have already considered, many circumstances affect the duration of  digestion; such as the quality, quantity, and temperature of the food; the  condition of the mind and body; sleep, exercise, and habit. Fresh food,  except new bread and the flesh of animals recently slain, is more rapidly  digested than that which is stale; and animal food more rapidly than that  from the vegetable kingdom.    [Sidenote: 42. Food in concentrated form? A large quantity of food?  Experiment on the dog? Ice-water? Variety of articles?]    42. Food should not be taken in too concentrated a form, the action of the  stomach being favored when it is somewhat bulky; but a large quantity in  the stomach often retards digestion. If the white of one egg be given to a  dog, it will be digested in an hour, but if the white of eight eggs be  given it will not disappear in four hours. A wineglassful of ice-water  causes the temperature of the stomach to fall thirty degrees; and it  requires a half-hour before it will recover its natural warmth--about a  hundred degrees--at which the operations of digestion are best conducted. A  variety of articles, if not too large in amount, is more easily disposed of  than a meal made of a single article; although a single indigestible  article may interfere with the reduction of articles that are easily  digested.    [Sidenote: 43. Strong emotion? The tongue of the patient?]    43. Strong emotion, whether of excitement or depression, checks digestion,  as do also a bad temper, anxiety, long fasting, and bodily fatigue. The  majority of these {99} conditions make the mouth dry, that is, they  restrain the flow of the saliva; and without doubt they render the stomach  dry also, by preventing the flow of the gastric juice. And, as a general  rule, we may decide, from a parched and coated tongue, that the condition  of the stomach is not very dissimilar, and that it is unfit for the  performance of digestive labor. This is one of the points which the  physician bears in mind when he examines the tongue of his patient.    [Sidenote: 44. Eating between meals? Severe exercise? Sleep after meals?]    44. The practice of eating at short intervals, or \"between meals,\" as it is  called, has its disadvantage, as well as rapid eating and over-eating,  since it robs the stomach of its needed period of entire rest, and thus  overtasks its power. With the exception of infants and the sick, no persons  require food more frequently than once in four hours. Severe exercise  either directly before or directly after eating retards digestion; a period  of repose is most favorable to the proper action of the stomach. The  natural inclination to rest after a hearty meal may be indulged, but should  not be carried to the extent of sleeping; since in that state the stomach,  as well as the brain and the muscles, seeks release from labor.    {100}    QUESTIONS FOR TOPICAL REVIEW.

The only one who survived the slaughter was one as tough as leather,  presumably the son of the big back grinder.    Had they talked to me about the man in the moon, I could not have been  more startled. I made up for it with my animals, which I was far from  forgetting amid this phantasmagoria of heroes and demigods. While  honoring the exploits of Cadmus and Cynoegirus, I hardly ever failed, on  Sundays and Thursdays [the weekly half-holiday in French schools], to go  and see if the cowslip or the yellow daffodil was making its appearance  in the meadows, if the Linnet was hatching on the juniper bushes, if the  Cockchafers were plopping down from the wind shaken poplars. Thus was  the sacred spark kept aglow, ever brighter than before.    By easy stages, I came to Virgil and was very much smitten with  Meliboeus, Corydon, Menalcas, Damoetas and the rest of them. The  scandals of the ancient shepherds fortunately passed unnoticed; and  within the frame in which the characters moved were exquisite details  concerning the bee, the cicada, the turtle dove, the crow, the nanny  goat and the golden broom. A veritable delight were these stories of  the fields, sung in sonorous verse; and the Latin poet left a lasting  impression on my classical recollections.    Then, suddenly, goodbye to my studies, goodbye to Tityrus and Menalcas.  Ill luck is swooping down on us, relentlessly. Hunger threatens us  at home. And now, boy, put your trust in God; run about and earn your  penn'orth of potatoes as best you can. Life is about to become a hideous  inferno. Let us pass quickly over this phase. Amid this lamentable  chaos, my love for the insect ought to have gone under. Not at all. It  would have survived the raft of the Medusa. I still remember a certain  pine cockchafer met for the first time. The plumes on her antennae, her  pretty pattern of white spots on a dark brown ground were as a ray of  sunshine in the gloomy wretchedness of the day.    To cut a long story short: good fortune, which never abandons the brave,  brought me to the primary normal school at Vaucluse where I was assured  food: dried chestnuts and chickpeas. The principal, a man of broad  views, soon came to trust his new assistant. He left me practically a  free hand, so long as I satisfied the school curriculum, which was very  modest in those days. Possessing a smattering of Latin and grammar, I  was a little ahead of my fellow pupils. I took advantage of this to  get some order into my vague knowledge of plants and animals. While a  dictation lesson was being corrected around me, with generous assistance  from the dictionary, I would examine, in the recesses of my desk, the  oleander's fruit, the snapdragon's seed vessel, the wasp's sting and the  ground beetle's wing-case.    With this foretaste of natural science, picked up haphazard and by  stealth, I left school more deeply in love than ever with insects and  flowers. And yet I had to give it all up. That wider education, which  would have to be my source of livelihood in the future, demanded this  imperiously. What was I to take in hand to raise me above the primary  school, whose staff could barely earn their bread in those days? Natural  history could not bring me anywhere. The educational system of the time  kept it at a distance, as unworthy of association with Latin and Greek.  Mathematics remained, with its very simple equipment: a blackboard, a  bit of chalk and a few books.    So I flung myself with might and main into conic sections and the  calculus: a hard battle, if ever there was one, without guides or  counselors, face to face for days on end with the abstruse problem which  my stubborn thinking at last stripped of its mysteries. Next came  the physical sciences, studied in the same manner, with an impossible  laboratory, the work of my own hands.    The reader can imagine the fate of my favorite branch of science in  this fierce struggle. At the faintest sign of revolt, I lectured myself  severely, lest I should let myself be seduced by some new grass, some  unknown Beetle. I did violence to my feelings. My natural history books  were sentenced to oblivion, relegated to the bottom of a trunk.    And so, in the end, I am sent to teach physics and chemistry at Ajaccio  College. This time, the temptation is too much for me. The sea, with its  wonders, the beach, whereon the tide casts such beautiful shells,  the maquis of myrtles, arbutus and mastic trees: all this paradise of  gorgeous nature has too much on its side in the struggle with the sine  and the cosine. I succumb. My leisure time is divided into two parts.  One, the larger, is allotted to mathematics, the foundation of my  academical future, as planned by myself; the other is spent, with much  misgiving, in botanizing and looking for the treasures of the sea. What  a country and what magnificent studies to be made, if, unobsessed by x  and y, I had devoted myself wholeheartedly to my inclinations!    We are the wisp of straw, the plaything of the winds. We think that we  are making for a goal deliberately chosen; destiny drives us towards  another. Mathematics, the exaggerated preoccupation of my youth, did  me hardly any service; and animals, which I avoided as much as ever I  could, are the consolation of my old age. Nevertheless, I bear no  grudge against the sine and the cosine, which I continue to hold in high  esteem. They cost me many a pallid hour at one time, but they always  afforded me some first rate entertainment: they still do so, when my  head lies tossing sleeplessly on its pillow.    Meanwhile, Ajaccio received the visit of a famous Avignon botanist,  Requien by name, who, with a box crammed with paper under his arm, had  long been botanizing all over Corsica, pressing and drying specimens  and distributing them to his friends. We soon became acquainted. I  accompanied him in my free time on his explorations and never did the  master have a more attentive disciple. To tell the truth, Requien was  not a man of learning so much as an enthusiastic collector. Very few  would have felt capable of competing with him when it came to giving the  name or the geographical distribution of a plant. A blade of grass, a  pad of moss, a scab of lichen, a thread of seaweed: he knew them all.  The scientific name flashed across his mind at once. What an unerring  memory, what a genius for classification amid the enormous mass of  things observed! I stood aghast at it. I owe much to Requien in the  domain of botany. Had death spared him longer, I should doubtless  have owed more to him, for his was a generous heart, ever open to the  troubles of novices.    In the following year, I met Moquin-Tandon, with whom, thanks  to Requien, I had already exchanged a few letters on botany. The  illustrious Toulouse professor came to study on the spot the flora which  he proposed to describe systematically. When he arrived, all the hotel  bedrooms were reserved for the members of the general council which had  been summoned; and I offered him board and lodging: a shakedown in a  room overlooking the sea; fare consisting of lampreys, turbot and sea  urchins: common enough dishes in that land of Cockayne, but possessing  no small attraction for the naturalist, because of their novelty. My  cordial proposal tempted him; he yielded to my blandishments; and there  we were for a fortnight chatting at table de omni re scibili after the  botanical excursion was over.    With Moquin-Tandon, new vistas opened before me. Here it was no longer  the case of a nomenclator with an infallible memory: he was a naturalist  with far-reaching ideas, a philosopher who soared above petty details to  comprehensive views of life, a writer, a poet who knew how to clothe the  naked truth in the magic mantle of the glowing word. Never again shall  I sit at an intellectual feast like that: 'Leave your mathematics,' he  said. 'No one will take the least interest in your formula. Get to the  beast, the plant; and, if, as I believe, the fever burns in your veins,  you will find men to listen to you.'    We made an expedition to the center of the island, to Monte Renoso,  with which I was already familiar. I made the scientist pick the hoary  everlasting (Helichrysum frigidum), which makes a wonderful patch of  silver; the many-headed thrift, or mouflon grass (Armeria multiceps),  which the Corsicans call erba muorone; the downy marguerite  (Leucanthemum tomosum), which, clad in wadding, shivers amid the  snows; and many other rarities dear to the botanist. Moquin-Tandon was  jubilant. I, on my side, was much more attracted and overcome by his  words and his enthusiasm than by the hoary everlasting. When we came  down from the cold mountaintop, my mind was made up: mathematics would  be abandoned.    On the day before his departure, he said to me: 'You interest yourself  in shells. That is something, but it is not enough. You must look into  the animal itself. I will show you how it's done.'    And, taking a sharp pair of scissors from the family work-basket and  a couple of needles stuck into a bit of vine shoot which served as a  makeshift handle, he showed me the anatomy of a snail in a soup plate  filled with water. Gradually he explained and sketched the organs which  he spread before my eyes. This was the only, never-to-be-forgotten  lesson in natural history that I ever received in my life.    It is time to conclude. I was cross-examining myself, being unable to  cross-examine the silent Beetle. As far as it is possible to read within  myself, I answer as follows: 'From early childhood, from the moment  of my first mental awakening, I have felt drawn towards the things of  nature, or, to return to our catchword, I have the"]]]
