The beaked whales have the following characteristics in common: 1) two  small creases forming a V-shape on the throat, 2) the absence of a  conspicuous notch on the rear margin of the tail flukes (some specimens  have a slight indentation), and 3) the absence of functional teeth in  all except adult males. Adult males have a single pair of teeth in the  lower jaw, the position and description of which help to identify the  species. The teeth of females are not functional and only rarely emerge  from the gums. Therefore, if a stranded animal is an adult male, its  species can be determined by the position and description of the teeth.  For example, in _Mesoplodon mirus_, the teeth are located near the tip  of the lower jaw; in _M. europaeus_, they are located about a third of  the way from the tip of the snout to the corner of the mouth; in _M.  bidens_, they are nearly half way from the tip of the snout to corner  of the mouth; and in M. densirostris, they are located in large  prominences near the back of the mouth.    If the animal is a female or an immature male, however, museum  preparation and examination might be required before the species can be  positively determined. The following four sections summarize characters  of western North Atlantic beaked whales.    [Illustration: Figure 76.--An unidentified beaked whale from the  mid-Pacific. Note the marks along the back, presumably tooth rakes,  consisting of scratches that are paired and close together. A beaked  whale in the western North Atlantic marked in this manner would be a  northern bottlenosed whale (p. 67), a goosebeaked whale (p. 70), or a  True's beaked whale (p. 77). These are the only three species in which  the teeth are located close together near the tip of the lower jaw.  (_Photo by K. C. Balcomb._)]    [Illustration: Figure 77.--Various views of a herd of five or six  unidentified beaked whales, possibly dense-beaked whales, 12 miles off  Pokai Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. The animals were very shy and had low  indistinct blows, making them difficult to spot and track. As they  surfaced, individuals frequently bucked their heads and slapped the chin  against the surface, rather than rolling. They did not raise their tail  flukes when beginning their long dives. (_Photos by E. Shallenberger,  Sea Life Park, Hawaii._)    (Because so little is known of beaked whales every encounter should be  recorded in as much detail as possible.)]    [Illustration: Figure 78.--Adult male beaked whales, showing the body  profile and the relative positions of the teeth.

Winn._)]          TRUE'S BEAKED WHALE (T)    _Mesoplodon minis_ True 1913      Other Common Names    None known.      Description    True's beaked whales reach a length of at least 16 feet (4.9 m) long.  They are chunky in midbody and narrow rapidly towards the tail, closely  resembling goosebeaked whales (p. 70). In overall body shape, the head  is small with a slight indentation in the area of the blowhole, a slight  bulge to the forehead, and a pronounced beak. The flippers are small  (from one-fourteenth to one-tenth the body length). The dorsal fin is  small, slightly falcate, located in the latter third of the back, and  followed by a pronounced ridge on the tail stock. The flukes, which  sometimes contain a very slight notch, are broad (to almost one-fifth  the body length).    True's beaked whales are dull black to dark gray on the back, lighter  slate gray on the sides, and white on the belly. The body is frequently  covered with light colored spots or splotches and bears numerous pairs  of scratch marks, presumably tooth rakes (Fig. 76).    The flippers are all black and are attached in the dark coloration of  the animal's side. The flukes are dark above and below.      May Be Confused With    True's beaked whales are most likely to be confused with goosebeaked  whales (p. 70) but may also be confused with any of the other beaked  whales species (p. 74 and Fig. 78).      Distribution    True's beaked whales appear to be primarily temperate in distribution.  They have been reported from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia south as  far as Flagler Beach in Florida. Northernmost records are for summer  months.    The range of True's beaked whales overlaps with that of the Antillean  beaked whale but is more northerly.      Stranded Specimens    The teeth of adult male True's beaked whales may be visible near the tip  of the lower jaw, a characteristic shared with the goosebeaked whale (p.  70) and the northern bottlenosed whale (p. 67). Both these other species  reach substantially greater maximum lengths than True's beaked whales,  however, and should be readily distinguishable by this and the number of  other highly distinctive characteristics of each species.    Females and subadult males may be confused with any of the beaked whales  species (p. 74 and Fig. 78).    [Illustration: Figure 79.--Two views of the body of a stranded True's  beaked whale from northeastern Florida. This species reaches at least 16  feet (4.9 m) and closely resembles the goosebeaked whale in general body  shape. It is distributed in temperate waters from Nova Scotia to  Florida.

Description    Antillean beaked whales reach a length of at least 22 feet (6.7 m). They  are slender in form and appear somewhat laterally compressed (i.e.,  taller than they are wide). The head is extremely small and tapers  rapidly to a narrow beak. The flippers are small (to about one-twelfth  the body length) with their origin well down on the sides of the body.  The dorsal fin is small, located behind the midpoint of the back, and  variable in shape from falcate to triangular. The flukes are less than  one-fifth the body length and are not notched.    Antillean beaked whales are dark grayish black on the back and sides,  slightly lighter on the abdomen. The flukes are dark gray above and  below.      Natural History Notes    Antillean beaked whales are probably primarily oceanic in distribution  and are known to feed on squid.      May Be Confused With    Antillean beaked whales may be confused with any of the other beaked  whales though they are larger than all except the northern bottlenosed  whale (p. 67) and the goosebeaked whale (p. 70).      Distribution    Antillean beaked whales have been reported stranded from the latitude of  Long Island, N.Y. south to Florida, thence into the Caribbean and the  Gulf of Mexico.      Stranded Specimens    The teeth of Antillean beaked whales are located at the suture of the  mandible, about one-third of the way from the tip of the snout to the  corner of the mouth (Fig. 78).    [Illustration: Figure 81.--Two views of an Antillean beaked whale  stranded in New Jersey in 1899. Note the very small head, the prominent  back-curved dorsal fin, and the slightly concave rear margin of the tail  flukes, which lack a distinct notch. (_Photos by F. W. True, courtesy of  U.S. National Museum._)]    [Illustration: Figure 82.--Two views of an Antillean beaked whale  stranded in Jamaica. This species reached at least 22 feet (6.7 m) in  length. Compared to the smaller True's beaked whale, Antillean beaked  whales have a smaller head, a narrower beak, and a taller, narrower  body. Furthermore, the teeth of this species are located about one-third  of the way back from the tip of the snout to the corner of the mouth.  (_Photos by J. J. Rankin._)]          DENSE-BEAKED WHALE (T)    _Mesoplodon densirostris_ (Blainville in Desmarest 1817)      Other Common Names    None known.      Description    Dense-beaked whales reach a length of at least 17 feet (5.2 m). The body  is distinctly spindle-shaped. The head, the contour of which is the most  distinctive characteristic of this species, is marked by a prominent  rise, located near the angle of the gape on each side. This rise, which  bears the teeth, gives a peculiar high, arching contour to the mouth (p.  84), particularly in adult males.    The flippers are small (one-eleventh to one-tenth the body length) and  have their origin in the lighter color of the lower sides. The dorsal  fin varies from small and triangular to nearly falcate and pointed on  the tip. It is located behind the midpoint of the back. The flukes are  from one-sixth to one-fifth the body length, are seldom notched, and  occasionally even bulge slightly backwards near the center of the rear  margin.    Dense-beaked whales are black or charcoal gray on the back, slightly  lighter on the abdomen. They are somewhat blotched with grayish white  and are often extensively scratched or scarred. The flippers are lighter  than the back. The flukes are dark above, light below.      Natural History Notes    From stomach contents of stranded animals dense-beaked whales are known  to feed on squid.      May Be Confused With    Adult male dense-beaked whales can be separated from the other beaked  whales by the high, arching contour to the corners of the mouth. If  there is no adult male in the group, however, dense-beaked whales may be  confused with any of the other beaked whales species.      Distribution    Dense-beaked whales have been reported from Peggys Cove, Nova Scotia  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33543"],[0,"The Amphibians and Reptiles of Michoacán, México (#18)"],[1,"patches and an orange-salmon-colored throat; the belly in females  is pale orange-tan. The juveniles have a more contrasting color pattern;  the dark chevrons on the dorsum are bordered posteriorly by pale gray.    In Michoacan this species has been obtained in pine and pine-fir forests  from 1800 to 2700 meters. On Cerro Barolosa and at Dos Aguas, both in  the Sierra de Coalcoman, the lizards were found beneath the bark of  dead, standing pines. In the Sierra de Coalcoman _Sceloporus  heterolepis_ seems to fill the niche of the small arboreal _Sceloporus_  in the coniferous forest in southwestern Mexico, a position held by _S.  grammicus microlepidotus_ in the Cordillera Volcanica; the latter  species does not occur in the Sierra de Coalcoman. Five specimens of  _Sceloporus heterolepis_ are known from the Cordillera Volcanica,  whereas 603 of _S. grammicus microlepidotus_ have been collected there.  The ecological relationships that exist between the two species in the  Cordillera Volcanica are not known.    Insofar as is known, _Sceloporus heterolepis_ reaches the southern  limits of its range in the Sierra de Coalcoman and in the western part  of the Cordillera Volcanica. Other records for the species are from the  Sierra Madre Occidental in Jalisco. Langebartel (1959) described  _Sceloporus shannonorum_ from the mountains near the Durango-Sinaloa  border; the single specimen of _S. shannonorum_ differs significantly  from _S. heterolepis_ only in having fewer dorsal scales (48). The  acquisition of additional material, especially from Nayarit and northern  Jalisco, probably will provide a basis for showing that these two  populations are conspecific.      ~Sceloporus horridus oligoporus~ Cope         _Sceloporus oligoporus_ Cope, Proc.

All of the specimens from Michoacan seem to be typical _S. horridus  oligoporus_; none has more than six femoral pores.    Characteristically this species is found in open arid scrub forest; it  reaches its greatest abundance in rocky areas in which there are  scattered leguminous trees and bushes. It has been found in these low  trees and bushes almost as frequently as it has been found on the  ground; none has been seen in large trees or far above the ground.  Altitudinally, this species ranges from sea level to about 1600 meters.      ~Sceloporus melanorhinus calligaster~ Smith         _Sceloporus melanorhinus calligaster_ Smith, Proc. U. S.       Natl. Mus., 92:360, November 5, 1942.--Acapulco, Guerrero,       Mexico.

Smith (1942a:360) diagnosed _Sceloporus melanorhinus calligaster_ as  having fewer femoral pores than the other subspecies of _S.  melanorhinus_ and as having the lateral belly patches in the males  confluent in the midline. Examination of forty specimens from the  Tepalcatepec Valley and the coastal regions of Michoacan does not  substantiate this diagnosis. The number of femoral pores varies from 15  to 22 (18.9); 14 individuals (35%) had 20 or more femoral pores. Smith  (_loc. cit._) stated that _S. melanorhinus_ in Oaxaca had 18 to 27  (21.6) femoral pores and that 77 per cent of the specimens had more than  20 femoral pores. Of the 24 males examined from Michoacan, 18 have the  lateral belly patches separated in the midline. Usually they are  separated by no more than one scale, but in some individuals they are  separated by two or more scales. Although the above data minimize  certain differences between the northern and southern populations of  this species, certain of the color pattern characters seem to be  diagnostic of the subspecies inhabiting the Pacific lowlands from  Guerrero to Nayarit. Large adults of _S. m. calligaster_ have only a  faint dorsal pattern, which in the subspecies _melanorhinus_ and  _stuarti_ consists of a series of large, dark, interconnected triangles  on the back. This pattern is present in young and small adults of _S. m.  calligaster_; furthermore, in this subspecies the ventral coloration of  the males differs from that found in the more southern populations.  Adult males of _S. m. calligaster_ have a black throat, that changes to  brilliant blue posteriorly, and a large white spot medially on the chin.  This spot is present in some specimens from Oaxaca and Chiapas, but, if  present, it is much smaller and less distinct than in specimens from  Michoacan. In _S. m. calligaster_ the chest and midventral area are  orange to salmon-color.    A male from Lombardia in life was colored as follows: Dorsum grayish tan  bearing faint bluish gray flecks; chest deep salmon-orange, this color  continuing down midventral area to the somewhat paler groin; belly  patches pale blue fading to pale green laterally; throat black  anteriorly enclosing a white spot; throat blue posteriorly and bluish  green posterolaterally.    Individual lizards were observed to change in dorsal color from a pale  ashy gray to a rather dull brown. Normally, inactive individuals and  those observed on overcast days were dull brown.    _Sceloporus melanorhinus calligaster_ is found in trees in riparian  situations in the lowlands to elevations of about 1500 meters. It does  not inhabit the arid tropical scrub forest in the Tepalcatepec Valley or  on the coast, but in those areas is found in the gallery forests along  streams and rivers. The lizards are wary and live high in the trees;  they are especially difficult to locate in the rainy season, when the  trees are in full leaf.      ~Sceloporus pyrocephalus~ Cope         _Sceloporus pyrocephalus_ Cope, Proc.

This small species is extremely common in the Tepalcatepec Valley and  noticeably less so on the coast. It is usually found on the ground in  rocky areas, but males frequently have been seen on the trunks of low  trees in the scrub forest. Altitudinally, it ranges from sea level to  slightly more than 1000 meters. The sexes are readily distinguished in  the field (Oliver, 1937; Smith, 1939; Duellman, 1954b). In the dry  season only males were observed in the Tepalcatepec Valley, but in the  rainy season both sexes were found in approximately the same numbers.      ~Sceloporus scalaris scalaris~ Wiegmann         _Sceloporus scalaris_ Wiegmann, Isis von Oken, 21:370,       1828.--Mexico.

This small terrestrial species does not seem to be abundant anywhere in  the state. It sometimes is found in open pine, oak, or pine-oak forest,  but usually it is observed in areas supporting bunch grass. In such  places the lizards sun and forage on the open ground and quickly take  refuge in the large clumps of grass. Altitudinally, the species ranges  from 1550 to 2300 meters. Although _Sceloporus scalaris scalaris_ has  been found in association with _S. dugesi intermedius_, _S. spinosus_,  and _S. torquatus_, it does not seem to form any close ecological  association with any of these species. In the pine forests of the  Cordillera Volcanica _S. s. scalaris_ is replaced by _Sceloporus aeneus  aeneus_, another small terrestrial species that occurs in great  abundance throughout the coniferous forests of the Cordillera Volcanica.      ~Sceloporus siniferus siniferus~ Cope         _Sceloporus siniferus_ Cope, Proc.
