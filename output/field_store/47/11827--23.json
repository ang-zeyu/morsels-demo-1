Lyon was absolutely necessary; and those who know the subsequent  career of my friends, Messrs. Watt and Budden, need not be told that if  health had permitted Benares would have been for many years the sphere  of their labours.    [Sidenote: CELIBATE OR MARRIED MISSIONARIES?]    As the withdrawal of missionaries has often been caused by the failure  of the health of their wives, some have thought it would be well to have  celibate missionaries in a country which has so severe a climate. To  this there is the obvious reply that missionaries, like others, are  human beings, and a restriction on them which wars with human nature  would be found very pernicious, as it has ever been. Then, the wives of  missionaries, when they are what they ought to be, are very efficient  and, indeed, necessary missionary workers, and in many cases their  labours are as useful as those of their husbands. In well-ordered  missionary families the people see what a happy Christian home is, and  they are assured of a sympathy in their trials and cares which they  could not expect from unmarried missionaries. Some Societies, our own  among the number, have accepted as missionaries to India persons engaged  to be married, but they have required them to remain for a year or two  unmarried after going out to test their fitness for the climate; and, in  the event of the test being successfully stood, to give them an  experience which will enable the newly married wife to enter with less  strain on her Indian life. This may be a wise arrangement, and yet there  is often a restlessness till the marriage takes place, and time spent in  going to the port of debarkation, which carries with it some  disadvantages.    We dare not retreat from this great work of evangelizing India on  account of the vicissitudes of which I have been speaking, or on account  of other very formidable obstacles which oppose us. To do so would be to  act a craven part. Agents must be found for the prosecution of the work,  and we must hope with the improved advantages of an Indian career the  failures will be fewer than in the past; but whatever they may be, the  Christian Church must go forward. One obvious inference from the facts I  have stated, is the extreme desirableness of a native agency. The  natives of the land, when found fit for the work, have always been  highly prized. Many of this class are now labouring in different parts  of India, and there is every reason to hope that in coming years the  native agency will grow largely in extent and efficiency.    [Sidenote: IMPRESSION OF THE SECOND YEAR.]    During my second year in Benares I entered on every department of  mission work, and had many opportunities for intercourse with the  people. In my turn I preached to the native Christian congregation, went  with the missionaries and catechists to the city, and engaged in  teaching the boys attending our primary schools. I saw the great  gatherings of the people at their religious festivals, and realized  their character, and the nature of the work to which I had devoted my  life, more than I had previously done. Instead of following  chronological order, my object in these reminiscences will be best  attained by endeavouring to present to my readers those aspects of  Indian and mission life which, during my second year, made a deep  impression on my mind, an impression which was deepened by subsequent  experience.    [Illustration]        CHAPTER X.    THE RELIGIOUS GATHERINGS OF THE HINDUS.      Crowds pass through the temples of Benares every day, pay obeisance, and  present offerings; but on ordinary occasions there is no combined act of  worship conducted by a leader, as is common in Christian assemblies. On  occasions of special urgency--the failure of rain, its unseasonable  fall, the fear of famine, or the dread of a great calamity coming on the  community in some other form--sacrifices are offered up by priests in  the presence of great multitudes, in which all present unite. These are  very special and occasional services, for, as a rule, all over India  persons and families act apart.    Hindus are, however, eminently social, and in their religious services  full play is given to the social feeling. This is shown by their melas,  or religious gatherings, which are held all over the country, and are  extremely popular. Some of these melas are local, and have only a local  attendance. Those to which crowds from places far and near resort are  held in so-called sacred spots. Many are periodical, and are held at  fixed periods of the year in honour of their gods, and in celebration of  their exploits. Others, again, are held on special occasions, and of  these eclipses are the most attractive.    [Sidenote: THE SATURNALIA OF THE HINDUS.]    In the course of my second year I saw a good deal of these festivals. I  have a vivid and very unpleasant recollection of the Holee of that year,  the Saturnalia of the Hindus, which is held at the setting in of the hot  weather. It lasts for several days, during which the people act as if  freed from every moral restraint. There is a general cessation of  labour; the people wander about, indulge in the wildest freaks, address  to women who venture out the vilest words, leap and dance as if  possessed of the spirit of licence, and throw red colouring-matter on  those they meet, without respect of persons; till all seen in the  streets, with their besmeared faces and soiled clothes, have a most  disreputable appearance. The night is rendered hideous, and sleep  well-nigh impossible, by the drumming, fifing, and shouting of the  revellers, kept up till break of day. During this period many think  themselves at liberty to do what at another time they would deem very  culpable. Not a few partake of intoxicating drink, and if native  statements be true they give themselves over to the grossest  licentiousness. Europeans, as a rule, except it be necessary for them to  go abroad, remain quietly in their homes while the Holee lasts, and  mission work is for the time well-nigh suspended. When, however,  Europeans have occasion to go out they have little reason to fear  insult, as even in the Holee season they are regarded, if not with  respect, at least with a dread which restrains the revellers. The  hurtful influence of this season of licence can be conceived. I have  always observed that for some time afterwards the boys in our schools  were sleepy and listless.    On the night of the Diwalee mela, held in honour of Lakshmee, the  goddess of wealth, the whole city is illuminated, tiny lamps are seen  everywhere, friends give presents to each other, sweetmeats and parched  grain are distributed among the poor. High and low give the night to  gambling. The belief is entertained that if they fail to spend the night  in this manner they will in their next birth be turned into frogs, or  some vile reptile.    The most popular festival of the year at Benares and over the  North-Western Provinces is the Ram Leela, the Play of Ram, when the life  of Ram, a very popular incarnation of Vishnu, is dramatized. This drama  is acted in the open air in different parts of the city, in the presence  of admiring thousands. The people see Ram and his faithful spouse Seeta  forced to leave their royal home by the intrigue of his mother-in-law;  they see them in the forest, where Ram leads the life of a hunter; they  see Seeta carried off by Rawan, the Demon King of Lunka (Ceylon); they  hear Ram's cries of bitter distress on finding his beloved Seeta gone;  they see him informed that Rawan is the ravisher; they see him setting  out with the divine monkey Hanuman, and his army of monkeys for the  rescue; and they rejoice with him in the taking of Lunka, the  destruction of Rawan, and the rescue of Seeta. The story furnishes  abundant material for a drama, and the people enter with the greatest  zest into the different scenes. A huge figure of Rawan is made of wood  and paper; it is set on fire, and the crowds, looking on, make the air  resound with their shouts. During this mela two things are united which  in Hindu estimation well agree--amusement and devotion. They regard the  Ram Leela as a religious service, which they are bound to render to the  conqueror of Rawan, and while rendering it they are at once performing  duty and receiving pleasure. They continually call such a service  _tumasha_, _show_, _fun_, and they regard its life and sprightliness a  pleasing contrast to the sombre and staid services of the Christian  Church.    [Sidenote: ECLIPSE OF THE MOON.]    Before the conclusion of my second year an eclipse of the moon occurred,  which drew to the city the greatest assemblage of human beings I had  ever seen. The Hindus place high among their deities the sun and moon,  and render to them daily worship. Between the gods and the demons there  is perpetual war, and victory inclines at one time to one side, at  another time to another. In Hindu mythological annals many instances are  recorded of the gods having been reduced to the utmost extremity. We are  told that eclipses are caused by the demons endeavouring to swallow the  sun and moon; and religious services on these occasions have a double  benefit--the worshipper secures a high degree of merit, of which he will  reap the reward one day; and the demons are driven off from their prey  by the drumming, the shouts, and the merit of the assembled people, to  the great relief of the endangered gods. The most extravagant promises  are held out to those who bathe in the Ganges, at any time in any part  of it; but bathing on the occasion of an eclipse, and especially in so  sacred a place as Benares, is meritorious in a degree which is  incalculable. The Pundits, the religious leaders of the people, have, it  appears, access to the council of the demons, for the exact time of the  coming attack is known by them so long before hand that the people far  and near are prepared for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2442"],[0,"History of the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, (#18)"],[1," was  maintained that there are certain causes for which persons ought to  be removed from office without being guilty of treason, bribery, or  malfeasance, and that the nature of things demands that it should be so.  \"Suppose,\" it was said, \"a man becomes insane by the visitation of God,  and is likely to ruin our affairs; are the hands of Government to be  confined front warding off the evil? Suppose a person in office  not possessing the talents he was judged to have at the time of the  appointment, is the error not to be corrected; suppose he acquire  vicious habits and incurable indolence, or totally neglect the duties of  his office, which shall work mischief to the public welfare, is there  no way to arrest the threatened danger? Suppose he become odious and  unpopular by reason of the measures he pursues, and this he may do  without committing any positive offense against the law, must he  preserve his office in despite of the popular will? Suppose him grasping  for his own aggrandizement and the elevation of his connections by every  means short of the treason defined by the Constitution, hurrying your  affairs to the precipice of destruction, endangering your domestic  tranquility, plundering you of the means of defense, alienating the  affections of your allies, and promoting the spirit of discord, must the  tardy, tedious, desultory road, by way of impeachment, be traveled to  overtake the man who, barely confining himself within the letter of the  law, is employed in drawing off the vital principle of the Government?\"  The nature of things, the great objects of society, the express objects  of the Constitution itself require that this thing should be otherwise.  To unite the Senate with the President \"in the exercise of the power\"  it was said, would involve us in the most serious difficulty. \"Suppose  a discovery of any of these events should take place when the Senate  is not in session, how is the remedy to be applied? The evil could be  avoided in no other way than by the Senate sitting always.\" In regard  to the danger of the power being abused if exercised by one man, it was  said \"that the danger is as great with respect to the Senate, who  are assembled from various parts of the continent, with different  impressions and opinions;\" that such a body is more likely to misuse the  power of removal than the man whom the united voice of America calls to  the presidential chair. As the nature of Government requires the power  of removal, it was maintained \"that it should be exercised in this way  by the hand capable of exerting itself with effect, and the power must  be conferred on the President by the Constitution as the executive  officer of the Government.\" Mr. Madison, whose adverse opinion in the  Federalist had been relied upon by those who denied the exclusive power,  now participated in the debate. He declared that he had reviewed his  former opinions, and he summed up the whole case as follows:    \"The Constitution affirms that the executive power is vested in the  President. Are there exceptions to this proposition? Yes, there are.  The Constitution says that in appointing to office the Senate shall be  associated with the President, unless, in the case of inferior officers,  when the law shall otherwise direct. Have we (that is, Congress) a  right to extend this exception? I believe not. If the Constitution has  invested all executive power in the President, I return to assert  that the Legislature has no right to diminish or modify his executive  authority. The question now resolves itself into this: is the power of  displacing an executive power? I conceive that if any power whatever  is in the Executive, it is in the power of appointing, overseeing, and  controlling those who execute the laws. If the Constitution had  not qualified the power of the President in appointing to office by  associating the Senate with him in that business, would it not be clear  that he would have the right by virtue of his executive power to make  such appointment? Should we be authorized, in defiance of that clause  in the Constitution--the executive power shall be vested in the  President--to unite the Senate with the President in the appointment to  office? I conceive not. It is admitted that we should not be authorized  to do this, I think it may be disputed whether we have a right to  associate there in removing persons from office, the one power being as  much of an executive nature as the other; and the first is authorized by  being excepted out of the general rule established by the Constitution  in these words: 'The executive power shall be vested in the President.'\"    The question thus ably and exhaustively argued was decided by the House  of Representatives, by a vote of 34 to 20, in favor of the principle  that the executive power of removal is vested by the Constitution in the  Executive, and in the Senate by the casting vote of the Vice President.  The question has often been raised in subsequent times of high  excitement, and the practice of the Government has nevertheless  conformed in all cases to the decision thus early made. * * * Chancellor  Kent's remarks on the subject are as follows:    \"On the first organization of the Government it was made a question  whether the power of removal in case of officers appointed to hold  at pleasure resided nowhere but in the body which appointed, and, of  course, whether the consent of the Senate was not requisite to remove.  This was the construction given to the Constitution while it was pending  for ratification before the State conventions by the author of the  Federalist. But the construction which was given to the Constitution by  Congress, after great consideration and discussion, was different.  The words of the act (establishing the Treasury Department) are: 'And  whenever the same shall be removed from office by the President of  the United States, or in any other case of vacancy in the office, the  assistant shall act.' This amounted to a legislative construction of the  Constitution, and it has ever since been acquiesced in and acted upon  as decisive authority in the case. It applies equally to every other  officer of the Government appointed by the President, whose term of  duration is not specially declared. It is supported by the weighty  reason that the subordinate officers in the executive department ought  to hold at the pleasure of the head of the Department, because he is  invested generally with the executive authority, and the participation  in that authority by the Senate was an exception to a general principle  and ought to be taken strictly. The President is the great responsible  officer for the faithful execution of the law, and the power of removal  was incidental to that duty, and might often be requisite to fulfill  it.\"    Thus has the important question presented by this bill been settled, in  the language of the late Daniel Webster (who, while dissenting from it,  admitted that it was settled), by construction, settled by precedent,  settled by the practice of the Government, and settled by statute.    The events of the last war furnished a practical confirmation of the  wisdom of the Constitution as it has hitherto been maintained in many  of its parts, including that which is now the subject of consideration.  When the war broke out rebel enemies, traitors, abettors, and  sympathizers were found in every department of the Government, as well  in the civil service as in the land and naval military service. They  were found in Congress and among the keepers of the Capitol, in foreign  missions, in each and all of the Executive Departments, in the judicial  service, in the Post Office, and among the agents for conducting Indian  affairs; and upon probable suspicion they were promptly displaced by  my predecessor, so far as they held their offices under executive  authority, and their duties were confided to new and loyal successors.  No complaints against that power or doubts of its wisdom, were  entertained in any quarter.    Having at an early period accepted the Constitution in regard to the  executive office in the sense in which it was interpreted with the  concurrence of its founders, I have found no sufficient grounds in the  arguments now opposed to that construction or in any assumed necessity  of the times for changing those opinions. For these reasons I return  the bill to the Senate, in which House it originated, for the further  consideration of Congress, which the Constitution prescribes. Insomuch  as the several parts of the bill which I have not considered are matters  chiefly of detail, and are based altogether upon the theory of the  Constitution from which I am obliged to dissent, I have not thought  it necessary to examine them with a view to make them an occasion of  distinct and special objections. Experience, I think, has shown that it  is the easiest, as it is also the most attractive, of studies to frame  constitutions for the self-government of free States and nations.    But I think experience has equally shown that it is the most difficult  of all political labors to preserve and maintain such free constitutions  of self government when once happily established. I know no other way  in which they can be preserved and maintained except by a constant  adherence to them through the various vicissitudes of national  existence, with such adaptations as may become necessary, always to be  effected, however, through the agencies and in the forms prescribed in  the original constitutions themselves. Whenever administration fails  or seems to fail in securing any of the great ends for which Republican  Government is established, the proper course seems to be to renew the  original spirit and forms of the Constitution itself.    Andrew Johnson    The bill was promptly passed in both Houses over the President's veto  and became a law.    As pertinent and incident to the history of this"]]]
