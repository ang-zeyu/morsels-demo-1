[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27911"],[0,"The Giraffe Hunters (#18)"],[1," they found themselves surrounded by a party of  about forty Africans, some armed with spears, while others carried bows  and arrows.    From the hostile attitude of the new-comers the hunters saw that they  meant mischief; and, seizing their guns, they determined to defend  themselves to the last.        CHAPTER TWENTY SIX.    CAPTURED.    Pushing in front of Groot Willem, Congo entreated him not to make  resistance; and so strong seemed his desire that they should surrender  without making an effort to maintain their freedom, that he caught hold  of the gun which Hendrik had already brought to his shoulder.    \"Poison! arrows and spears all poison!\" shouted the Kaffir, who appeared  well-nigh scared out of his senses.    Both Willem and Hendrik had heard, seen, and read enough of the African  tribes who use poisoned spears and darts, to feel something of Congo's  alarm.    They were not cowards, but they saw before them several men carrying  weapons more deadly at short distance than their own fire-arms.  Only  one drop of blood had to be drawn by the point of one of their javelins,  to cause certain death accompanied by horrible agonies!    They could not expect to conquer thirty or forty men, without receiving  a scratch or two in the encounter; and knowing this, they took Congo's  advice and surrendered.    When the Kaffir saw that the capture of himself and his masters had been  effected without a battle, he recovered his self-possession, and  demanded of the natives the cause of their strange conduct.    An individual then stepped forward who appeared to have some influence  over the others; and by his eloquence Congo became a little wiser, and a  great deal more alarmed.    The African spoke in a language which only the Kaffir understood.  He  stated that he had lost two horses,--both of which had been killed at a  vley where they had gone to drink.  Although grieved at the loss of his  horses, both which he had received as presents, he was quite happy in  having discovered the party whom he believed to have wilfully destroyed  his property.    The hunters directed Congo to inform him that the horse had been shot by  mistake,--that they very much regretted the circumstance; and were quite  ready and willing to make ample compensation for the damage he had  sustained.    This the black chief declared was all he required, and the hunters were  invited to accompany him to his village, where they could talk over the  terms of compensation.    All started up the river, but the behaviour and methodical division of  their escort convinced the hunters that they were considered as  captives.    \"This is very unfortunate,\" said Hendrik.  \"We shall have to part with  something we can ill spare.  They will not be satisfied with trifles,  and perhaps will want our horses in exchange for those killed.\"    \"They shall not have them then,\" rejoined Willem, with an air of  determination, forgetting at the moment that he was a prisoner, and the  horses already in possession of their captors.    About a mile from the place where the Africans had come upon them, they  reached a small collection of huts, from which issued a large number of  women and children.  It was evidently the kraal of their captors.    The leader of the party lost no time in proceeding to business.  He was  anxious to have his claim settled; so also were Groot Willem and  Hendrik.  Congo was again called to act as interpreter.    The black chief desired him to inform his masters, that the horses he  had lost were of immense value.  They had been given to him by an  esteemed friend, a Portuguese slave-merchant; and he declared that, in  his opinion, they were the best horses in the world.  No others could  replace them.    \"Very well,\" said Groot Willem, when this communication had been made;  \"ask him what he expects us to pay.\"    \"All this ceremony is not for nothing,\" remarked Hendrik, while Congo  was again talking to the chief.  \"We shall have some trouble in getting  off from this fellow unless we surrender everything we've got.\"    \"He mustn't be too greedy,\" replied Willem, \"or he will get nothing at  all.  We have performed a silly action, and expect to pay for it.\"    \"Those are brave words,\" answered Hendrik, \"but I don't think we have  power to act up to them.  It will be they who will dictate terms; and  what can we do?\"    The chief, before making known his conditions, desired it to be  understood that, a mistake having been committed, on that account he  would not be hard upon them.  He would not punish them for what they had  done, more than to require compensation for his loss, which he at the  same time gave them to understand was wholly irreparable.    From the appearance of the horses they had killed, the hunters believed  that the animals had been left behind by some slave-trader, too merciful  to take them any farther.  They had evidently been used up by a long  journey, and the chief had probably been thanked by their former owner  for allowing them to die a natural death in his dominions.    The amount of damage was at length declared by the plaintiff, who was at  the same time acting as judge.    \"Tell them,\" said he to the interpreter, \"that all I require, by way of  compensation, will be their own horses along with their guns and  ammunition.\"    \"What!\" exclaimed Groot Willem, jumping to his feet in rage, \"Give them  my horse and roer?  No, not for all the horses in Africa.\"    Hendrik was no less surprised and enraged at the attempt to extort from  them; and, seeing the folly of continuing the parley any longer, the  youths, without saying a word, walked off towards their horses,  intending to mount and ride off.    This intention was opposed by the chief and others of the tribe, when an  affray ensued, in which Groot Willem measured his strength against half  a score of the natives.  In their attempt to take his gun from him,  several were hurled to the earth, and amongst them the chief himself.  He did not desire to discharge the piece.  A shot could only have killed  one, while his enemies were legion.    Whether they would have conquered him without taking his life, or not,  was doubtful, had not one of the Africans, more cunning than his  fellows, adopted an ingenious expedient to terminate the struggle.  Seizing a large cone-shaped basket, used for catching fish, he ran  behind the young hunter and clapped it, extinguisher-like, over his  head.  The basket was immediately laid hold of by two or three others;  by whom the giant was dragged to the earth and held there until they had  bound him with thongs of zebra hide.    Before this feat had been accomplished Hendrik had received a blow from  one of the natives that prevented him from making any resistance; and he  too was trussed up for safe keeping.    Congo had not interfered in the outrage on his masters, but on the  contrary he seemed rather pleased at the turn events had taken.  This,  however, did not prevent the Africans from tying him like the others.    The rage of Hendrik, on awaking from a brief period of stupor and  finding himself fast bound, would be difficult to describe.  There can  be no greater agony to a brave and sensitive man than to find himself  helpless for revenge after having undergone a deep humiliation.    Groot Willem, no less brave but of a different temperament, was more  resigned to the indignity they were enduring.  His anger had been  aroused by the attempt to take from him a thing he greatly prized,--his  gun.  He had been defeated in trying to retain it; but now that it was  gone, and along with it his liberty, he determined to exert some degree  of philosophy and patiently wait for what should happen next.    Congo, who had appeared indifferent to seeing his masters bound,--in  fact rather pleased at it,--now looked sad enough while submitting to  similar treatment.  His fellow-captives could have no sympathy, since  his behaviour had not failed to beget suspicions of his ingratitude.        CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.    IN THONGS.    The prisoners were compelled to remain inactive spectators of a division  of their property, most of which was appropriated by the chief himself,  as a sort of compensation for the loss of his horses, and the damage his  own person had sustained in the capturing of one of his prisoners.  For,  before securing Groot Willem, he had been sent to the earth under a blow  from that sturdy hunter's roer.    Beyond this present humiliation, the hunters had placed themselves under  another and more serious obligation,--that of satisfying a desire for  revenge.    \"It is no use, baas Willem,\" said the Kaffir, who had managed to get  close beside his master.  \"We'll be killed for showing fight.\"    Congo next expressed his opinion that, had no resistance been offered to  the chief, an opportunity might have been afforded them for returning to  Macora.  He was quite positive now that no chance for this would be  allowed, not even to himself, who had only been pretending to be a  traitor for the sake of gaining favour, and thus being enabled to assist  them, his young masters.    \"Do you think they really intend to kill us, Congo?\" asked Willem.    \"Yaas, baas.  Sure they intend it,\" answered the Kaffir.  \"They 'fraid  now to let us go.\"    \"But, if they intend killing us, why do they not do so at once?\"  inquired Hendrik.    Congo explained, that their captors belonged to a wandering tribe of  Zooloo Kaffirs, a warlike people, who had but little respect for white  men.  They were of a race that demanded tribute of the Portuguese at the  north, and obtained it; and he was sure that they would never forgive  the insult of their chief being knocked down in the presence of his  subjects.  That, alone, would lead to their being killed.    His explanation of the reason why they were not killed immediately  showed him to be so well acquainted with the manners and customs of the  people into whose hands they had fallen,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27933"],[0,"Forest Neighbors: Life Stories of Wild Animals (#18)"],[1,"with a start. He had heard  something--he was sure he had--the wolves were coming, and he gave the  white man a punch in the ribs.    \"Wake up, wake up, m'shoor!\" he whispered, excitedly. \"The wolves are  coming. I can hear them on the snow.\"    The white man was up in a twinkling, but by that time the porcupine hod  settled himself in a crotch, out of reach of the smoke, and the woods  were silent again. The two listened with all their ears, but there was  not a sound to be heard.    \"You must have been dreaming, Louis.\"    The half-breed insisted that he had really heard the patter of the  wolves' feet on the snow-crust, but the timber cruiser laughed at him,  and lay down to sleep again. An hour later the performance was repeated,  and this time the white man was angry.    \"Don't you wake me up again, Louis. You're so rattled you don't know  what you're doing.\"    Louis was silenced, but not convinced, and he did not let himself go to  sleep again. The fire was dying down, and little by little the  smoke-cloud grew thinner and thinner until it disappeared entirely. Then  the half-breed heard the same sound once more, but from the tree  overhead, and not from across the snow. He waited and watched, and  presently a dark-brown animal, two or three feet in length and about  the shape of an egg, came scrambling cautiously down the trunk. The  porky reached the ground in safety, and searched among the tin plates  and the knives and forks until he found a piece of bacon rind; but he  got just one taste of it, and then Louis hit him over the head with a  club. Next morning the land-lookers had porcupine soup for breakfast,  and they told me afterward that it was very good indeed.    Our Porky had seen it all. He waited till the men had tramped away  through the woods, with their packs on their backs and their snow-shoes  on their feet, and then he, too, came down from his tree on a tour of  investigation. His friend's skin lay on the snow not very far away--if  you had pulled the quills and the longer hairs out of it, it would have  made the pelt which the old fur-traders sometimes sold under the name of  \"spring beaver\"--but he paid no attention to it. The bacon rind was what  interested him most, and he chewed and gnawed at it with a relish that  an epicure might have envied. It was the first time in all his  gluttonous little life that he had ever tasted the flavor of salt or  wood-smoke; and neither lily-pads, nor beechnuts, nor berries, nor  anything else in all the woods could compare with it. Life was worth  living, if only for this one experience; and it may be that he stowed a  dim memory of it away in some dark corner of his brain, and hoped that  fortune would some day be good to him and send him another rind.    The long, long winter dragged slowly on, the snow piled up higher and  deeper, and the cold grew sharper and keener. Night after night the  pitiless stars seemed sucking every last bit of warmth out of the old  earth and leaving it dead and frozen forever. Those were the nights when  the rabbits came out of their burrows and stamped up and down their  runways for hours at a time, trying by exercise to keep from freezing to  death, and when the deer dared not lie down to sleep. And hunger came  with the cold and the deep snow. The buck and the doe had to live on  hemlock twigs till they grew thin and poor. The partridges were buried  in the drifting snow, and starved to death. The lynxes and the wild-cats  hunted and hunted and hunted, and found no prey; and it was well for the  bears and the woodchucks that they could sleep all winter and did not  need food. Only the Porcupine had plenty and to spare. Starvation had no  terrors for him.    But the hunger of another may mean danger for us, as the Porcupine  discovered. In ordinary times most of the animals let him severely  alone. They knew better than to tackle such a living pin-cushion as he;  and if any of them ever did try it, one touch was generally enough. But  when you are ready to perish with hunger, you will take risks which at  other times you would not even think about; and so it happened that one  February afternoon, as the Porky was trundling himself deliberately over  the snow-crust, a fierce-looking animal with dark fur, bushy tail, and  pointed nose sprang at him from behind a tree and tried to catch him by  the throat, where the quills did not grow, and there was nothing but  soft, warm fur. The Porcupine knew just what to do in such a case, and  he promptly made himself into a prickly ball, very much as his mother  had done seven or eight months before, with his face down, and his  quills sticking out defiantly. But this time his scheme of defence did  not work as well as usual, for the sharp little nose dug into the snow  and wriggled its way closer and closer to where the jugular vein was  waiting to be tapped. That fisher must have understood his business, for  he had chosen the one and only way by which a porcupine may be  successfully attacked. For once in his life our friend was really  scared. Another inch, and the fisher would have won the game, but he was  in such a hurry that he grew careless and reckless, and did not notice  that he had wheeled half-way round, and that his hind-quarters were  alongside the Porcupine's. Now, sluggish and slow though a porky may be,  there is one of his members that is as quick as a steel trap, and that  is his tail. Something hit the fisher a whack on his flank, and he gave  a cry of pain and fury, and jumped back with half a dozen spears  sticking in his flesh. He must have quite lost his head during the next  few seconds, for before he knew it his face also had come within reach  of that terrible tail and its quick, vicious jerks. That ended the  battle, and he fled away across the snow, almost mad with the agony in  his nose, his eyes, his forehead, and his left flank. As for the Porky,  he made for the nearest tree as fast as he could go, hardly trusting in  his great deliverance. And I don't believe there is any sight in all the  Great Tahquamenon Swamp much funnier than a porky in a hurry--a porky  who has really made up his mind that he is in danger and must hustle for  dear life. He is the very personification of haste and a desire to go  somewhere quick, and he picks his feet up and puts them down again as  fast as ever he can; and yet, no matter how hard he works, his legs are  so short and his body so fat that he can't begin to travel as fast as he  wants to.    Another day the lynx tried it, and fared even worse than the fisher--not  the Canada lynx, with whom we are already somewhat acquainted, but the  bay lynx. The fisher had had some sense, and would probably have  succeeded if he had been a little more careful, but the lynx was a fool.  He didn't know the very first thing about the proper way to hunt  porcupines, and he ought never to have tried it at all, but he was  literally starving, and the temptation was too much for him. Here was  something alive, something that had warm red blood in its veins and a  good thick layer of flesh over its bones, and that was too slow to get  away from him; and he sailed right in, tooth and claw, regardless of the  consequences. Immediately he forgot all about the Porcupine, and his own  hunger, and everything else but the terrible pain in his face and his  forepaws. He made the woods fairly ring with his howls, and he jumped up  and down on the snow-crust, rubbing his head with his paws, and driving  the little barbed spears deeper and deeper into the flesh. And then,  all of a sudden, he ceased his leaping and bounding and howling, and  dropped on the snow in a limp, lifeless heap, dead as last summer's  lily-pads. One of the quills had driven straight through his left eye  and into his brain. Was it any wonder if in time the Porcupine came to  think himself invulnerable?    Even a northern Michigan winter has its ending, and at last there came  an evening when all the porcupines in the woods around the Glimmerglass  were calling to each other from one tree to another. They couldn't help  it. There was something in the air that stirred them to a vague  restlessness and uneasiness, and our own particular Porky sat up in the  top of a tall hemlock and sang. Not like Jenny Lind, nor like a thrush  or a nightingale, but his harsh voice went squealing up and down the  scale in a way that was all his own, without time or rhythm or melody,  in the wildest, strangest music that ever woke the silent woods. I don't  believe that he himself quite knew what he meant or why he did it.  Certainly no one else could have told, unless some wandering Indian or  trapper may have heard the queer voices and prophesied that a thaw was  coming.    The thaw arrived next day, and it proved to be the beginning of spring.  The summer followed as fast as it could, and again the lily-pads were  green and succulent in the shallow water along the edge of the  Glimmerglass, and again the Porcupine wandered down to the beach to feed  upon them, discarding for a time his winter diet of bark and twigs. Why  should one live on rye-bread when one can have cake and ice-cream?    And there among the bulrushes, one bright June morning, he had a fight  with one of his own kind. Just as he was approaching his favorite log,  two other porcupines appeared, coming from different directions, one a  male, and the other a female. They all scrambled out upon the log, one  after another, but it soon became evident that three was a crowd. Our  Porky and the other bachelor could not agree at all. They both wanted  the same place and the same lily-pads, and in a little while they were  pushing and shoving and growling and snarling with all their might, each  doing his best to drive the other off the log and into the water. They  did not bite--perhaps they had agreed that teeth like theirs were too  cruel to be used in civilized warfare--but they struggled and chattered  and"]]]
