After  several years of close confinement at Arcetri, during which time he  suffered much from rheumatism and continued ill-health, aggravated by  grief and mental depression consequent upon the death of his favourite  daughter, Galileo applied for permission to go to Florence in order to  place himself under medical treatment. This request was granted by the  Pope subject to certain conditions, which would be communicated to him  when he presented himself at the office of the Inquisition at Florence.  These were more severe than he anticipated. He was forbidden to leave  his house or receive any of his friends there, and those injunctions  were so strictly adhered to that during Passion Week he had to obtain a  special order so that he might be able to attend mass. At the expiration  of a few months Galileo was ordered to return to Arcetri, which he never  left again.    An affliction, perhaps the most deplorable that can happen to any human  being, was added to the burden of Galileo's misfortunes and woes. A  disorder which had some years previously injured the sight of his right  eye returned in 1636. In the following year the left eye became  similarly affected, with the result that in a few months Galileo became  totally blind. His friends at first hoped that the disease was cataract,  and that some relief might be afforded by means of an operation; but it  was discovered to be an opacity of the cornea, which at his age was  considered unamenable to treatment. This sudden and unexpected calamity  was to Galileo a most deplorable occurrence, for it necessitated the  relinquishment of his favourite pursuit, which he followed with such  intense interest and delight. His friend Castelli writes: 'The noblest  eye is darkened which Nature ever made; an eye so privileged, and gifted  with such rare qualities that it may with truth be said to have seen  more than all of those eyes who are gone, and to have opened the eyes of  all who are to come.' Galileo endured his affliction with patient  resignation and fortitude, and in the following extract from a letter by  him he acknowledges the chastening hand of a Divine Providence: 'Alas!  your dear friend and servant Galileo has become totally blind, so that  this heaven, this earth, this universe, which with wonderful  observations I had enlarged a hundred and a thousand times beyond the  belief of bygone ages, henceforward for me is shrunk into the narrow  space which I myself fill in it. So it pleases God; it shall then please  me also.' The rigorous curtailment of his liberty which prompted Galileo  to head his letters, 'From my prison at Arcetri,' was relaxed when total  blindness had supervened upon the infirmities of age. Permission was  given him to receive his friends, and he was allowed to have free  intercourse with his neighbours.    Milton, during his stay at Florence, visited Galileo at Arcetri. We are  ignorant of the details of this eventful and interesting interview  between the aged and blind astronomer and the young English poet, who  afterwards immortalised his name in heroic verse, and who in his  declining years suffered from an affliction similar to that which befel  Galileo, and to which he alludes so pathetically in the following  lines:--                              Thee I revisit safe,      And feel thy sovran vital lamp; but thou      Revisitest not these eyes, that roll in vain      To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;      So thick a drop serene hath quenched their orbs,      Or dim suffusion veiled.--iii. 21-26.    We can imagine that Galileo's astronomical views, which at that time  were the subject of much discussion among scientific men and professors  of religion, and on account of which he suffered persecution, were  eagerly discussed. It is also probable that the information communicated  by Galileo, or by some of his followers, may have persuaded Milton to  entertain a more favourable opinion of the Copernican theory. The  interesting discoveries made by Galileo with his telescope without doubt  formed a pleasant subject of conversation, and Milton enjoyed the  privilege of listening to a detailed description of these from the lips  of the aged astronomer. The telescope, its principle, its mechanism, and  the method of observing, were most probably explained to him; and we can  believe that an opportunity was afforded him of examining those in  Galileo's observatory, and of perhaps testing their magnifying power  upon some celestial object favourably situated for observation. Though  Milton has not favoured us with any details of his visit to Galileo, yet  it was one which made a lasting impression upon his mind, and was never  afterwards forgotten by him. 'There it was,' he writes, 'I found and  visited the famous Galileo, grown old, a prisoner of the Inquisition for  thinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and Dominican  licensers thought.' In years long after, when Milton, himself feeble  and blind, sat down to compose his 'Paradise Lost,' the remembrance of  the Tuscan artist and his telescope was still fresh in his memory.    By the invention of the telescope and its application to astronomical  research, a vast amount of information and additional detail have been  learned regarding the bodies which enter into the formation of the solar  system; and by its aid many new ones were also discovered. On sweeping  the heavens with the instrument, the illimitable extent of the sidereal  universe became apparent, and numberless objects of interest were  brought within the range of vision the existence of which had not been  previously imagined.    The Galilean telescope was invented in 1609. But the magnifying power of  certain lenses, and their combination in producing singular visual  effects, are alluded to in the writings of several early authors. The  value of single lenses as an aid to sight had been long known, and  spectacles were in common use in the fourteenth century. Several  mathematicians have described the wonderful optical results obtained  from glasses concave and convex, of parabolic and circular forms, and  from 'perspective glasses,' in which were embodied the principle of the  telescope. It is asserted that our countryman, Roger Bacon (1214), had  some notion of the properties of the telescope; but among those familiar  with the combination of lenses the two men who made the nearest approach  to the invention of the instrument were Baptista Porta and Gerolamo  Fracastro. The latter, who died in 1553, writes as follows: 'For which  reason those things which are seen at the bottom of water appear greater  than those which are at the top; and if anyone look through two  eye-glasses, one placed upon the other, he will see everything much  larger and nearer.' It is doubtful if Fracastro had any notion of  constructing a mechanism which might answer the purpose of a telescopic  tube. Baptista Porta (1611) is more explicit in what he describes. He  writes: 'Concave lenses show distant objects most clearly, convex those  which are nearer; whence they may be used to assist the sight. With a  concave glass distant objects will be seen, small, but distinct; with a  convex one, those near at hand, larger, but confused; if you know  _rightly_ how to combine one of each sort, you will see both far and  near objects larger and clearer.' He then goes on to say: 'I shall now  endeavour to show in what manner we may continue to recognise our  friends at the distance of several miles, and how those of weak sight  may read the most minute letters from a distance. It is an invention of  great utility, and grounded on optical principles; nor is at all  difficult of execution; but it must be so divulged as not to be  understood by the vulgar, and yet be clear to the sharp-sighted.' After  this, he proceeds to describe a mechanism the details of which are  confusing and unintelligible, nor did it appear to bear any resemblance  to a telescopic tube.    In a work published by Thomas Digges in 1591, he makes the following  allusion to his father's experiments with the lenses: 'My father, by his  continuall painfull practices, assisted with demonstrations  mathematicall, was able, and sundry times hath by proportionall glasses,  duely situate in convenient angles, not only discouered things farre  off, read letters, numbered peeces of money with the verye coyne and  superscription thereof cast by some of his freends of purpose, upon  downes in open fields; but also seuen miles off, declared what hath beene  doone at that instant in priuate places.' It must be admitted that if  Leonard Digges had not constructed a telescope, he knew how to combine  lenses by the aid of which a visual effect was created similar to that  produced by the use of the instrument.    The inventor of the telescope was a Dutchman named Hans Lippershey, who  carried on the business of a spectacle-maker in the town of Middelburg.  His discovery was purely accidental. It is said that the  instrument--which was directed towards a weather-cock on a church spire,  of which it gave a large and inverted image--was for some time exhibited  in his shop as a curiosity before its importance was recognised. The  Marquis Spinola, happening to see this philosophical toy, purchased it,  and presented it to Prince Maurice of Nassau, who imagined it might be  of service for the purpose of military reconnoitring. The value of the  invention was, however, soon realised, and in the following year  telescopes were sold in Paris. In 1609, Galileo, when on a visit to a  friend at Venice, received intelligence of the invention of an  instrument by a Dutch optician which possessed the power of causing  distant objects to appear much nearer than when observed by ordinary  vision. The accuracy of this information was confirmed by letters which  he received from Paris; and this general report, Galileo asserted, was  all he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28458"],[0,"What a Young Woman Ought to Know (#18)"],[1," body may be rubbed  with a wet cloth, followed by vigorous, dry rubbing. Cleanliness at  all times is certainly a mark of refinement.    You should use good sense and not run out in thin slippers on wet or  cold ground; but if your feet get wet through accident, keep in motion  until you can make a change of shoes and stockings. There is little  danger from wet feet to those in good health, if they keep in vigorous  motion.    As to other rules, they are those that pertain to the care of health  at all times: loose clothing, deep breathing, wholesome food, plenty  of sleep, sunlight, pure air, exercise according to your strength,  and, above all, serenity of mind, accepting the fact of physical  womanhood, together with a recognition of its sacredness and dignity.    As a minor item, I would suggest that the napkins be fastened to  straps that go over the shoulder and are then joined together in front  and back to an end piece, on each of which a button is sewn.  Buttonholes in the napkins at the corners, diagonal from each other,  will make them easily attached or removed. The napkins should be of a  material that is quickly absorbent of the flow. Cheesecloth is cheap,  and can be burned or otherwise disposed of after using. It may be  protected by an outer strip of unbleached muslin which is almost  water-proof.    A very comfortable way of arranging napkins that are to be used from  time to time is to take a piece of linen or cotton diaper sixteen  inches square. About three inches from one end, make on each side an  incision four inches long. Fold this strip in the middle lengthwise,  and sew together up to the end of the incisions. This makes a band  with a sort of pocket in the middle. Hem the cut edges. Fold the  napkin over, four inches on each side, that is as deep as the  incisions. Then fold crosswise until you can enclose the whole in the  pocket in the band. This makes a thick center and thin ends by which  to attach the napkin to the suspender.    I hold that mental serenity is one of the essentials of healthful  menstrual periods, and this cannot be had if the mind is continually  troubled and the thought centered on the physical condition. I would  be glad to have your mind freed from the ideas of sex matters as far  as possible. It is a scientific fact that thinking continually of an  organ tends to disturb that organ. I know a man who was so afraid of  heart disease that he felt of his pulse every few minutes and kept a  stethoscope on the head of his bed to listen to his heart in the  night. I would have been surprised had he not had heart trouble.          CHAPTER XIX.    SOLITARY VICE.      As the reproductive system awakens to activity it naturally attracts  the attention of the girl, and an effort should be made to call her  thoughts to other themes.    As I have said before, the reading of sensational love stories is most  detrimental. The descriptions of passionate love scenes arouse in the  reader a thrill through her own sexual organism that tends to increase  its activity and derange its normal state. Girls often mature into  women earlier than they should, because through romances, through  jests of associates in regard to beaus and lovers, and through  indulgence in sentimental fancies their sexual systems are unduly  stimulated and aroused. This stimulation sometimes leads to the  formation of an evil habit, known as self-abuse. The stimulation of  the sex organs is accompanied with a pleasurable sensation, and this  excitement may be created by mechanical means, or even by thought.  Many girls who are victims of this most injurious habit are unaware of  its dangers, although they instinctively feel that they do not want it  known. Others who would not stoop to a mechanical exciting of  themselves do so through thoughts, and do not know that they are just  as truly guilty of self-abuse as the girl who uses the hand or other  mechanical means.    The results of self-abuse are most disastrous. It destroys mental  power and memory, it blotches the complexion, dulls the eye, takes  away the strength, and may even cause insanity. It is a habit most  difficult to overcome, and may not only last for years, but in its  tendency be transmitted to one's children.    If you have from the first thought nobly of yourself, you will have  fallen into no such debasing habit. But if, through ignorance, you  have acquired it, how shall you overcome it?    I should hesitate to write more on this subject did I not know that  many girls fall victims to this evil through ignorance, and many who  thus fall could and would have been saved had they been rightly  instructed. I therefore desire that you shall be wise.    Every normal function of the body is attended with a pleasurable  sensation. We enjoy eating, seeing, walking. Odors bring sensations  which are agreeable, the sense of touch may give pleasure, and as we  enjoy these sensations in fact, so we may enjoy them in memory or in  imagination. We can recall the beauty of the rose, the perfume of the  mignonette, the flavor of the orange, or we can imagine new  combinations of these delights. We feel joy or grief through reading  vivid descriptions, or we can ourselves create imaginary scenes in  which we are actors, who suffer or enjoy.    The reproductive system is the seat of great nervous susceptibility,  and the excitation of these nerves gives a pleasurable sensation. This  excitation may be thought a local mechanical irritation or it may be  mental. In little children it may be caused by lack of cleanliness of  the external organs. An irritation is produced, and an attempt to  allay this by rubbing produces an agreeable feeling, which may be  repeated until the evil habit of self-abuse is formed.    Sometimes constipation, by creating a pelvic congestion, will have the  same result. Sometimes clothing which is too small may, by undue  pressure on the parts, call the thought of the child to these organs,  and in an attempt to remove the pressure by pulling the clothing away  the habit may be begun.    Sometimes the tiny pin-worms in the rectum may wander into the vagina,  and the little girl feel a constant annoyance, which rubbing allays  temporarily, but which results in the evil habit of the use of the  hands to produce an agreeable sensation. Thus through avoidable causes  the evil habit may be acquired. Then it may be taught by one thus  learning it to another who, without this instruction, would never have  acquired it.    But new dangers arise as the girl approaches the age when the  reproductive system begins to take on the activity that indicates  approaching womanhood. The normal congestion of the parts causes a  hitherto unknown consciousness of sex, and unless she is warned she  may at this period acquire the habit without knowing its evils.    All functions necessary to the preservation of the individual life are  attended with pleasure, and so are those which are for the  continuation of the species. While the emotion may be pleasurable, it  is at the same time the most exhausting, that can be experienced. We  see that in some forms of animal existence parenthood is purchased at  the expense of the life of the parent; and while in the human being  the procreative act does not kill, it exhausts, and no doubt takes  from the vital force of those exercising it. One can feel justified to  lose a part of her own life if she is conferring life upon others, but  to indulge in such a waste of vital force merely for pleasure is  certainly never excusable, and least excusable of all is the arousing  of pleasurable emotions by a direct violation of natural law.    The only natural method of arousing a recognition of sexual feeling is  as God has appointed in holy marriage, and the self-respecting girl  feels that no approach of personal familiarity is either right or  proper. But it may be that she does not know that feelings may be  awakened by the imagination which are as wrong morally as, and more  injurious physically than, actual deeds, and so may allow her mind to  revel in fancies that would shock her as actualities.    I received a letter not long ago from a young woman who most  emphatically asserted that she would never, never, never permit  familiarities, and then most innocently says, \"but it wouldn't be  wrong to imagine yourself enjoying the embrace of some certain one,  would it?\"    It is just this idea that there is no wrong in thought that weakens  virtue's fortress and renders it easily demolished. Girls who would  shrink from use of mechanical means to arouse sexual desire will  permit themselves to revel in imaginary scenes of love-making with  real or unreal individuals, or in mental pictures which arouse the  spasmodic feelings of sexual pleasure, and yet be unaware that they  are guilty of self-abuse.    Sexual feeling in itself is not base, but it can be debased either in  thought or in deed. Rightly considered, it is the indication of the  possession of the most sacred powers, that of the perpetuation of  life.    \"Passion is the instinct for preservation of one's kind, the voice of  the life principle, the sign of creative power.\" These last four words  open before us a wonderful field of thought. \"Creative power!\" What  does that mean? Is creative power limited to reproduction of kind? Do  you not create when you work out with brain some idea and then embody  it in some visible form? Worth is said to create an artistic dress,  the actor creates his part in the play, the musician creates the  arrangement of harmonies which are represented in musical signs, and  in the same sense you may be in a myriad of ways a creator.    With the beginning of activity of sexual life in yourself came  increased development and new energy, beauty, and power, and the  preservation and right use of that life will continue to be a source  of power. \"When the signs of this creative power come throbbing and  pulsing in every fiber,"]]]
