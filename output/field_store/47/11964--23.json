The Bluestocking paused and looked round the circle of interested faces.  Even the Ass was intent on her words, but the Good Stockbroker's eyes  were averted and the Bluestocking was quite pale as she continued:    'Of course the word at once recalls the harem, the zenana, but nothing  of that kind would do. The wives would have to live separately, as the  Mormons do, each in her own home, with her own circle of interests and  duties, her own lifework. No one ought to live in idleness, which is the  cause of all sorts of discord and trouble. Every woman should work at  something, and to help someone. I'm not thinking now, of course, of  happily married and contented women, but of the thousands leading  miserable, dull, and lonely lives, who would be infinitely happier if  they had a certain week to look forward to, at regular recurring  intervals, when their husbands would be living with them. It would bring  love and human interest and, what is most important of all, a _motive_  into their existence. I know it sounds dreadfully immoral,' she went on,  blushing again painfully, 'but, oh! I don't mean it like _that_. After  all, the chief reason why people marry is for companionship, and it is  companionship that unmarried women, past the gaiety of first youth,  chiefly lack. The natural companion of woman is man; therefore, as there  aren't enough husbands to go round, it follows that one might do worse  than share them. I don't say it would be as satisfactory as having a  devoted husband all to oneself, but it might be for the greatest good of  the greatest number, and it would surely solve to a certain extent  the--the social evils.'    They all clapped when she had finished somewhat breathlessly. It was  obvious that the brave Bluestocking so far lacked the courage of her  opinions as to be agonisingly embarrassed at this public expression of  them. The Gentle Lady, who is the most tactful creature in existence,  accordingly rose before anyone had time to speak, and the two women left  the room together.    A babble of talk arose from the men, under cover of which the Good  Stockbroker also slipped quietly away.    'Pass the port,' said the Wicked Stockbroker, briskly. 'She's a deuced  bright little woman, but how even the brainy ones can be so ignorant of  life beats me, and how you chaps can be such hypocrites. . . . !'    'Hypocrites! what d'you mean?' blustered the Family Egotist, who was by  now almost bursting with suppressed talk.    'Not you, old chap, but the Weary Roue and the Good Stockbroker, jawing  away as if they really thought monogamy was in the majority in this  country, and polygamy was something new! Of course one expects it from  the G. S., but you, W. R., really ought to know better--by the way,  where is the G. S?'    'I think he must have gone to propose to the Bluestocking--to save her  from polygamy and her own opinions,' drawled the Weary Roue, lighting  his cigarette.    'Stout fella! I believe he has!' cried the Ass, excitedly. 'I'll have a  shilling each way on it with any of you--I mean it, really!'    'Oh! what if he has?' said the Family Egotist, irritably. 'What does one  fool more in the world matter? Do stop rotting, you fellows, and pass  the port.'            V      IS LEGALISED POLYANDRY THE SOLUTION?      In Mr W. Somerset Maugham's very interesting psychological study, _Mrs  Craddock_, he makes one of his characters say: 'The fact is that few  women can be happy with only one husband. I believe that the only  solution of the marriage question is legalised polyandry.'    This is the kind of statement which it is only respectable to receive  with horror, but if the secrets of feminine hearts could be known it  might prove that a goodly amount of this horror is assumed. I decline to  commit my sex either way. Mr Maugham is evidently a gentleman very  deeply experienced in feminine hearts, and I daresay he knows what he is  talking of. He is, moreover, safely unmarried, but even he entrenches  himself behind one of the characters in his novel, and who am I that a  greater courage should be expected of me?    There is, of course, a marvellous virtue in the word 'legalised.' The  most unholy and horrible marriages between fair young girls and rich or  titled dotards, drunkards, or _cretins_ are considered perfectly proper  and respectable because 'legalised.' Yet the people who countenance  these abominations would probably be unutterably shocked by the very  whisper of polyandry--an infinitely more decent relation, because  regulated by honest sex attraction, and free presumably from mercenary  considerations. But whether legalised polyandry is THE solution to the  marriage question or not, it is clearly an impossible one for  women-ridden England, and though of late years women have made startling  strides, and shown themselves possessed of unsuspected vitality, it  seems unlikely that their superfluous energies will be expended in this  direction.            VI      A WORD FOR DUOGAMY      'God made you, but you marry yourself.' --R. L. STEVENSON.      The day after the polite dinner-party, Isolda, Miranda, and Amoret came  in to tea, and I retailed to them the discussion of the previous evening  on polygamy.    'I see the Bluestocking's point,' said Isolda, thoughtfully: 'polygamy  might be acceptable to the superfluous woman who can't marry under  present conditions--the discontented spinster to whom the single state  is so detestable that even polygamy would be preferable--but it would  never be acceptable to the woman who can and does marry.'    'Yet how many married women put up with it nowadays?' said Miranda;  'aren't there ever so many wives who condone their husband's infidelity,  and endure it as best they can, for the sake of the children, or for  social reasons, or because they're sufficiently attached to the man to  prefer a share of him to life alone without him? And what is that but  countenancing polygyny?'    'Ah! but then the other women are only mistresses,' exclaimed Isolda.  'One might tolerate that unwillingly, but another legal wife, with  rights equal to one's own or, worse, with children to compete with one's  own--never!'    'Well, perhaps not,' agreed Miranda; 'I suppose a legal and permanent  rival would be somewhat different, but, after all, it's only the middle  class in England who can be termed strictly monogamous--the upper and  lowest are as polygynous as can be. It's only our British hypocrisy that  makes us pretend monogamy is our rule!'    'Don't quarrel with British hypocrisy,' said Amoret, lazily, 'it's our  most valuable national asset. Hypocrisy simply holds the fabric of  society together.'    'Agreed,' said Isolda, 'we must pretend to believe monogamy is the rule,  for peace sake, and for the ideal's sake. Of course everybody knows  there are plenty of polygynous husbands about, and, for the matter of  that, polyandrous wives, but hypocrisy is a great aid to decency, and a  nation must have decency of _theory_ at least, if not of practice, or we  should--er--h'm--decline like the Romans.'    'I was waiting for one of you to mention the Romans,' interposed Amoret,  who for all her frivolity has a certain humorous shrewdness of her own.  'It's an invariable feature of all discussions on marriage. Directly one  so much as breathes a suggestion that the marriage tie should be made  more flexible to suit modern conditions, everyone present, except the  unhappily married, pulls a long face and quotes the awful example of the  Romans. Now I've got a gorgeous idea for solving the marriage problem.'    'Tell us,' cried three voices in unison.    'Not yet, let's get rid of the Romans first. I confided my idea to a man  the other day, and when he had floored me with the Romans as usual,  I went and looked up Gibbon.'    Laughter interrupted her: the idea of our butterfly Amoret poring over  Gibbon.    'Yes, I did,' she continued, 'and, as far as I could make out, it wasn't  their easy ideas about marriage that caused their decline, but  their--what shall I say?--their general moral slackness. . . .'    'I know,' said Isolda, coming to the rescue. 'I was reading a  frightfully interesting book about it the other day, _Imperial Purple_.  It was the relaxing of all ideals, the giving way entirely to carnal  appetites, the utter lack of moral backbone consequent on excess of  luxury and prosperity that smashed up the Romans. But if a strenuous,  cold-blooded nation like ourselves chose to relax the stringent  conditions of marriage, and kept strictly to the innovation, well, it's  absurd to say all our ideals would deteriorate and the Empire collapse  in consequence!'    'Hear, hear! Worthy of the Bluestocking herself!'    'Very well,' said Miranda. 'I'll give in about the Romans if you like,  just so as to get on with the conversation. Now let's have your gorgeous  idea, Amoret.'    'It's just this,' said Amoret. '_Duogamy._'    '_Duo_--two?'    'Exactly--two partners apiece. We're all so complex nowadays that one  can't possibly satisfy us. Two would just do it. Two would serve to  relax the tension of married life, and yet would not lead to what the  newspapers call licence. Everyone would have another chance, and what  the first partner lacked would be supplied by the second.'    'It's not such a bad idea,' said Isolda, musingly. 'Launcelot could  choose a good walker and bridge player for his alternative wife, and I'd  try to find a man who hated cards and never walked a step when he could  possibly ride.'    'I think it's a grand idea,' cried Miranda, enthusiastically. 'Lysander  could find a woman who'd play his accompaniments and love musical  comedies, and I'd look out for a man who made a cult of the higher drama  and had two permanent stalls at the Vedrenne-Barker Theatre.'    'It would simply solve everything,' cried Amoret, ecstatically.

Do not  allow soup to boil after adding egg yolk. Discard outer leaves of  lettuce, using only the hearts for soup.      PRESSED CHICKEN    Disjoint a four- or five-pound fowl, cover with boiling water and let  simmer until tender, with one carrot sliced, one onion sliced, a blade  or two of celery broken in inch pieces, two sprays parsley and one-half  teaspoon peppercorns. Add one tablespoon salt the last hour of cooking.  Drain chicken from liquor, remove the skin and bones; strain liquor,  return to range and let simmer until reduced to one cup, strain and  reserve. When the meat is nearly cold, cut it in small cubes or chop  fine; remove all fat from liquor, reheat and add chicken, stirring it  slowly, season with salt and pepper if necessary. Decorate a granite,  brick-shaped bread pan with \"hard boiled\" eggs cut in rings or fancy  shapes, over these pack the chicken mixture very carefully so as not to  disturb the decorations. Cover with a buttered paper, place a weight  over paper and let stand over night in a cold place. Serve with Tomato  Salad.      TOMATO SALAD    Wash garden cress and shake dry, arrange a bed on large oval platter,  discarding all coarse leaves and stems. Peel and chill five  uniform-sized tomatoes, cut a slice from the stem ends and scoop out the  pulp, invert tomato cups on a plate and set aside in a cool place. Chop  fine the solid pulp of the tomato with one chilled and pared cucumber,  add two tablespoons finely chopped chives, stir in one cup of Cream  Dressing and refill tomato cups with mixture heaping them in pyramids.  Dispose these tomato cups at intervals in cress border and place mold of  pressed chicken in center.    CREAM SALAD DRESSING              1-1/2 teaspoon salt.            1/2 tablespoon mustard.            1 tablespoon sugar.            1 egg slightly beaten.            2-1/2 tablespoons melted butter.            3/4 cup cream.            4 tablespoons vinegar.    PROCESS: Mix ingredients in the order given, adding vinegar very slowly,  beating constantly. Cook in double boiler until mixture thickens;  continue beating, strain at once and chill.      LATTICE POTATOES    Wash and pare potatoes of a uniform size. Slice on a corrugated  vegetable slicer, which is made for this purpose. Wash slices in cold  water, changing the water several times; then let stand several hours in  cold water. Drain and dry with crash towels. Fry a few at a time in deep  hot Cottolene, drain on brown paper, sprinkle with salt. Pile on a lace  paper doily in a fancy basket.      GREEN CORN PUDDING    To two cups of cooked green corn, cut from the cob (or one can of corn)  chopped fine, add two eggs slightly beaten, one teaspoon salt,  one-eighth teaspoon pepper, one teaspoon sugar, two tablespoons melted  butter, and two cups scalded milk. Mix well and turn into a buttered  pudding dish; bake until firm in moderate oven.      PEACH ICE CREAM NO. 1              1-1/2 cups peach pulp.            1-1/2 cups granulated sugar.            Juice one lemon.            1 quart thin cream.    PROCESS: Pare and stone choice, ripe peaches and rub the pulp through a  puree strainer; add sugar and lemon juice, turn into the can of freezer  packed in ice and salt (using three measures of crushed ice to one of  rock salt); add cream and freeze in the usual way.      RICH CHOCOLATE CAKE              1/2 cup Cottolene.            1-1/2 cups sugar.            4 eggs.            4 squares chocolate.            1 teaspoon cinnamon.            1/3 cup hot water.            1/2 cup milk.            2 cups flour.            3 teaspoons baking powder.            1/4 teaspoon salt.            1 teaspoon vanilla.    PROCESS: Cream Cottolene, add sugar gradually, stirring constantly. Melt  chocolate over hot water, add hot water specified in recipe and beat  immediately into creamed butter and sugar; add yolks of eggs beaten  until thick and light. Mix and sift flour, cinnamon, baking powder and  salt; add to first mixture alternately with milk, add vanilla. Cut and  fold in the stiffly-beaten whites of eggs. Bake in a shallow pan forty  to forty-five minutes. Cover with Boiled Frosting (for recipe see Page  56).      SPICED ICED TEA              4 teaspoons tea.            2 cups boiling water.            9 cloves.    PROCESS: Follow recipe for making tea. Strain into pitcher over cloves,  chill, then pour into glasses filled with cracked ice. Sweeten to taste.  The flavor of tea is preserved and is much finer by chilling the  infusion quickly, before pouring over ice. Allow three cloves for each  glass. The large Penang cloves are the best.          _August_                _Hunger is the best seasoning for meat,             And thirst for drink._                                         --_Cicero._    [Illustration]    [Sidenote: _August_    _First Sunday_]          Menu              NOVA SCOTIA CANAPES              PAN BROILED FILLETS OF BEEF--SULTANA SAUCE              CARLSBAD POTATOES      PEAS AND ONIONS FRENCH STYLE              LETTUCE, PEPPERGRASS AND ONION SALAD              PEACH ICE CREAM--COCOANUT CAKE              COFFEE           *       *       *       *       *    NOVA SCOTIA CANAPES    Cut white bread in one-third inch slices; stamp out with heart-shaped  cutter; spread both sides thinly with butter, brown them delicately in  the oven. Mince Nova Scotia smoked salmon and moisten with Mayonnaise or  Boiled Salad Dressing.
