And the crafty  eyes of old Polydectes, the king, ever watched her more eagerly,  always more hotly desired her for his wife. But Danae, the beloved of  Zeus himself, had no wish to wed the old king of the Cyclades, and  proudly she scorned his suit. Behind her, as she knew well, was the  stout arm of her son Perseus, and while Perseus was there, the king  could do her no harm. But Perseus, unwitting of the danger his mother  daily had to face, sailed the seas unfearingly, and felt that peace  and safety surrounded him on every side. At Samos one day, while his  ship was lading, Perseus lay down under the shade of a great tree, and  soon his eyelids grew heavy with sleep, and there came to him, like  butterflies that flit over the flowers in a sunlit garden, pleasant,  light-winged dreams. But yet another dream followed close on the merry  heels of those that went before. And before Perseus there stood one  whose grey eyes were as the fathomless sea on the dawn of a summer  day. Her long robes were blue as the hyacinths in spring, and the  spear that she held in her hand was of a polished brightness, as the  dart with which the gods smite the heart of a man, with joy  inexpressible, with sorrow that is scarcely to be borne. To Perseus  she spoke winged words.    \"I am Pallas Athene,\" she said, \"and to me the souls of men are known.  Those whose fat hearts are as those of the beasts that perish do I  know. They live at ease. No bitter sorrow is theirs, nor any fierce  joy that lifts their feet free from the cumbering clay. But dear to my  heart are the souls of those whose tears are tears of blood, whose joy  is as the joy of the Immortals. Pain is theirs, and sorrow.  Disappointment is theirs, and grief. Yet their love is as the love of  those who dwell on Olympus. Patient they are and long-suffering, and  ever they hope, ever do they trust. Ever they fight, fearless and  unashamed, and when the sum of their days on earth is accomplished,  wings, of whose existence they have never had knowledge, bear them  upwards, out of the mist and din and strife of life, to the life that  has no ending.\"    Then she laid her hand on the hand of Perseus. \"Perseus,\" she said,  \"art thou of those whose dull souls forever dwell in pleasant ease, or  wouldst thou be as one of the Immortals?\"    And in his dream Perseus answered without hesitation:    \"Rather let me die, a youth, living my life to the full, fighting  ever, suffering ever,\" he said, \"than live at ease like a beast that  feeds on flowery pastures and knows no fiery gladness, no  heart-bleeding pain.\"    Then Pallas Athene, laughing for joy, because she loved so well a  hero's soul, showed him a picture that made even his brave heart sick  for dread, and told him a terrible story.    In the dim, cold, far west, she said, there lived three sisters. One  of them, Medusa, had been one of her priestesses, golden-haired and  most beautiful, but when Athene found that she was as wicked as she  was lovely, swiftly had she meted out a punishment. Every lock of her  golden hair had been changed into a venomous snake. Her eyes, that had  once been the cradles of love, were turned into love's stony tombs.  Her rosy cheeks were now of Death's own livid hue. Her smile, which  drew the hearts of lovers from their bosoms, had become a hideous  thing. A grinning mask looked on the world, and to the world her  gaping mouth and protruding tongue meant a horror before which the  world stood terrified, dumb. There are some sadnesses too terrible for  human hearts to bear, so it came to pass that in the dark cavern in  which she dwelt, and in the shadowy woods around it, all living things  that had met the awful gaze of her hopeless eyes were turned into  stone. Then Pallas Athene showed Perseus, mirrored in a brazen shield,  the face of one of the tragic things of the world. And as Perseus  looked, his soul grew chill within him. But when Athene, in low voice,  asked him:    \"Perseus, wilt even end the sorrow of this piteous sinful one?\" he  answered, \"Even that will I do--the gods helping me.\"    And Pallas Athene, smiling again in glad content, left him to dream,  and Perseus awoke, in sudden fear, and found that in truth he had but  dreamed, yet held his dream as a holy thing in the secret  treasure-house of his heart.    Back to Seriphos he sailed, and found that his mother walked in fear  of Polydectes the king. She told her son--a strong man now, though  young in years--the story of his cruel persecution. Perseus saw red  blood, and gladly would he have driven his keen blade far home in the  heart of Polydectes. But his vengeance was to be a great vengeance,  and the vengeance was delayed.    The king gave a feast, and on that day every one in the land brought  offerings of their best and most costly to do him honour. Perseus  alone came empty-handed, and as he stood in the king's court as though  he were a beggar, the other youths mocked at him of whom they had ever  been jealous.    \"Thou sayest that thy father is one of the gods!\" they said. \"Where is  thy godlike gift, O Perseus!\"    And Polydectes, glad to humble the lad who was keeper of his mother's  honour, echoed their foolish taunt.    \"Where is the gift of the gods that the noble son of the gods has  brought me?\" he asked, and his fat cheeks and loose mouth quivered  with ugly merriment.    Then Perseus, his head thrown back, gazed in the bold eyes of  Polydectes.    Son of Zeus he was indeed, as he looked with royal scorn at those whom  he despised.    \"A godlike gift thou shalt have, in truth, O king,\" he said, and his  voice rang out as a trumpet-call before the battle. \"The gift of the  gods shall be thine. The gods helping me, thou shalt have the head of  Medusa.\"    A laugh, half-born, died in the throats of Polydectes and of those who  listened, and Perseus strode out of the palace, a glow in his heart,  for he knew that Pallas Athene had lit the fire that burned in him  now, and that though he should shed the last drop of his life's blood  to win what he sought, right would triumph, and wrong must be worsted.    Still quivering with anger, Perseus went down to the blue sea that  gently whispered its secrets to the shore on which he stood.    \"If Pallas Athene would but come,\" he thought--\"if only my dreams  might come true.\"    For, like many a boy before and since, Perseus had dreamed of gallant,  fearless deeds. Like many a boy before and since, he had been the hero  of a great adventure.    So he prayed, \"Come to me! I pray you, Pallas Athene, come! and let me  dream true.\"    His prayer was answered.    Into the sky there came a little silver cloud that grew and grew, and  ever it grew nearer, and then, as in his dream, Pallas Athene came to  him and smiled on him as the sun smiles on the water in spring. Nor  was she alone. Beside her stood Hermes of the winged shoes, and  Perseus knelt before the two in worship. Then, very gently, Pallas  Athene gave him counsel, and more than counsel she gave.    In his hand she placed a polished shield, than which no mirror shone  more brightly.    \"Do not look at Medusa herself; look only on her image here  reflected--then strike home hard and swiftly. And when her head is  severed, wrap it in the goatskin on which the shield hangs. So wilt  thou return in safety and in honour.\"    \"But how, then, shall I cross the wet grey fields of this watery  way?\" asked Perseus. \"Would that I were a white-winged bird that skims  across the waves.\"    And, with the smile of a loving comrade, Hermes laid his hand on the  shoulder of Perseus.    \"My winged shoes shall be thine,\" he said, \"and the white-winged  sea-birds shalt thou leave far, far behind.\"    \"Yet another gift is thine,\" said Athene. \"Gird on, as gift from the  gods, this sword that is immortal.\"    For a moment Perseus lingered. \"May I not bid farewell to my mother?\"  he asked. \"May I not offer burnt-offerings to thee and to Hermes, and  to my father Zeus himself?\"    But Athene said Nay, at his mother's weeping his heart might relent,  and the offering that the Olympians desired was the head of Medusa.    Then, like a fearless young golden eagle, Perseus spread out his arms,  and the winged shoes carried him across the seas to the cold northern  lands whither Athene had directed him.    Each day his shoes took him a seven days' journey, and ever the air  through which he passed grew more chill, till at length he reached the  land of everlasting snow, where the black ice never knows the  conquering warmth of spring, and where the white surf of the moaning  waves freezes solid even as it touches the shore.    It was a dark grim place to which he came, and in a gloomy cavern by  the sea lived the Graeae, the three grey sisters that Athene had told  him he must seek. Old and grey and horrible they were, with but one  tooth amongst them, and but one eye. From hand to hand they passed  the eye, and muttered and shivered in the blackness and the cold.    [Illustration: THEY WHIMPERED AND BEGGED OF HIM]    Boldly Perseus spoke to them and asked them to guide him to the place  where Medusa and her sisters the Gorgons dwelt.    \"No others know where they dwell,\" he said. \"Tell me, I pray thee, the  way that I may find them.\"    But the Grey Women were kin to the Gorgons, and hated all the children  of men, and ugly was their evil mirth as they mocked at Perseus and  refused to tell him where Medusa might be found.    But Perseus grew wily in his desire not to fail, and as the eye passed  from one withered, clutching hand to another, he held out his own  strong young palm, and in her blindness one of the three placed the  eye within it.    Then the Grey Women gave a piteous cry, fierce and angry as the cry of  old grey wolves that have been robbed of their prey, and gnashed upon  him with their toothless jaws.    And Perseus said: \"Wicked ye are and cruel at heart, and blind shall  ye remain forever unless ye tell me "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22694"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 2, January, 1851 (#18)"],[1,"of  Chemistry, Mineralogy, and Geology, in the year 1849. He has been  assisted in its preparation by Professor Kopp and several other savans  connected with the University at Giessen. It is marked by his usual  completeness, breadth of scope, and exhaustive treatment of each  particular subject. Liebig is now engaged in preparing a new series of  Chemical Letters, which will be specially devoted to the growth of this  science, in connection with the history of mental progress in general.  Professor Knobel, of the same University, has also issued a work on the  Genealogies of the Book of Genesis, which excites remark by the  thoroughness of its historical investigations. Leopold Schmid's last  work is on the Spirit of Catholicism, and also highly spoken of by both  Catholic and Protestant writers. This author holds a high rank in the  Catholic literature of Germany, and has been chosen Bishop of Mayence.  Professor Hillebrand is occupied with a revision of his highly esteemed  History of German national literature since Lessing. There seems to be  no reason to fear that Giessen is doing less than its share toward  keeping the ocean of German books up at a high-water mark.           *       *       *       *       *    BERANGER, the veteran _chansonier_, is now occupying himself in writing  biographies, anecdotes, criticisms, &c., of the public men with whom, in  the course of his long career, he has been in contact. It is five years  since he announced his intention of giving such a work to the public,  and he thinks it will possess great historical value, while of his  songs, which alone will convey his name to the last ages in which the  language of France is spoken, he thinks but \"indifferently well.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The house, at Paris, in which EUGENE SUE laid some of the most exciting  scenes of his \"Wandering Jew,\" has lately been advertised for sale, and  has been visited by crowds of curious loungers. It is known as the Hotel  Serilly, and is situated at No. 5 Rue Neuve Saint Francois, in the  quarter called the Marais. At the time the \"Wandering Jew\" was  published, the street was often filled by groups of gazers at the  strange old edifice, which had been so exactly described by the  romancer, that no one could mistake it. Some even ventured to knock at  the door and seek further information. They were received by a  mysterious and taciturn old Hebrew, who looked as if he himself had  charge of the great Rennepeal treasure, and three-quarters of the  visitors went away convinced that they had seen the veritable Samuel  himself. Now that the whole house has been thrown open to the public,  there have been found under it vast sub-cellars extending under the  large garden in the rear, and in these cellars are seven wells,  partially filled up, but with walls of careful masonry, and other  indications that they were of great depth and great utility. The opinion  was at once set on foot by the explorers, that the millions of the  treasure had been concealed in one of these wells. The fact is, that the  house formerly belonged to a Protestant family which suffered extreme  persecution after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and which  doubtless found the subterranean passages extremely convenient. In the  year 1791, it was inhabited by the revolutionist Carnot.           *       *       *       *       *    The COUNT DE TOCQUEVILLE, a relative of the author of \"Democracy in  America,\" has just published a historical work on the Reign of Louis  XVI. The writer, an old man almost sinking into the grave, enjoys the  advantage of having himself witnessed and even shared in a part of the  events he describes. He was intimate with Malasherbes, and personally  devoted to the unfortunate Louis. Of his ability as a writer, a former  work on the Reign of Louis XV. furnished proofs which are repeated in  the present volume. Of course he does full justice to the amiable  personal qualities of Marie Antoinette and her husband, without doing  injustice to their faults. But he shows that after all what was charged  upon them as political crime, was but the consequence of long-standing  causes, over which they had no control, or even of measures of reform to  which with the best intentions, they had given their consent. In  speaking of the mission of Franklin at the French Court, M. de  Tocqueville gives some interesting details. \"At Paris,\" he says, \"the  zeal for the cause of the insurgents constantly increased. The women who  exercised a great influence in the reign of Louis XVI., became  passionate supporters of the Americans, and made aiding them a question  of honor. The simple manners of their envoys,--their hair without  powder, their citizens' dress, pleased by a sort of piquant novelty. All  who approached Franklin were charmed by his wit. In him people venerated  the founder of the liberty of a great nation, and even grew enthusiastic  in behalf of that liberty.\" M. de Tocqueville shows however that the  prime minister Maurepas only feared the Americans because he was  embarrassed in his position, and thought to relieve himself by making  war with England. But as there was no good reason for making such a war,  the honesty of the King revolted at it. M. de Vergennes also said in the  Council, that England would be much more weakened by a long war with her  colonies, than by their loss. \"But how,\" repeated all the women, \"can we  help embracing the cause of a people which sends us ambassadors without  powder, and with shoe-strings, instead of buckles?\" So weighty a reason  turned the balance, and the war was declared. That war finished the ruin  of the French monarchy, not only by inspiring the officers and soldiers  sent to the United States with new ideas, but also by completing the  exhaustion of its finances. With regard to the Revolution in which Louis  XVI. lost his head, it is enough praise for our historian, that while he  inclines always to the monarchical side, he is not altogether unjust to  the popular virtues which shone with such rare brilliancy amid the gloom  of that epoch.           *       *       *       *       *    The great work of J. G. AUDUBON and the Rev. Dr. BACHMAN, upon the  \"Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America,\" is much praised by those  persons in Europe whose praise is of most value. The _Athenaeum_ remarks  that, hitherto, the mammalia of America have been known chiefly through  descriptions by zoologists, in the Transactions of European Societies,  and that no systematic attempt has been made to bring together into one  connected view the very varied forms of animal life presented by this  great continent, while these authors have not only used the materials  which were at hand in the works of others, but have themselves observed  with great diligence the habits of many of the creatures which they have  described. \"Their work is creditable to the United States, where a large  number of subscribers have induced the authors to undertake it,--and a  most valuable addition to our general natural-history literature.\" The  geographical range within which the animals described in these pages are  found is not that of the government of the United States merely; it  comprehends Russian and British America, in fact, all the country which  lies north of the tropics in the New World.           *       *       *       *       *    At the last MICHAELMAS BOOK FAIR at Leipsic, the Catalogue contained the  titles of 5,023 new works published in Germany since Easter. This is  from twelve to fifteen hundred more than at any fair since the  Revolution of 1848. A great number of these books are large and of  remarkable merit, being in some sort, the accumulation of the more  profound scientific labors of the past two years.           *       *       *       *       *    The BARONESS VON BECK has just published in London two volumes of  \"Personal Adventures\" in the Hungarian war. She is herself a Hungarian,  and she saw her husband fall while cheering his men to defend a  barricade at Vienna. In this book Kossuth is her hero, her prophet, her  demigod; and she sacrifices all other celebrities without compunction at  the altar of his greatness. Dembinsky she treats with manifest  injustice; Georgey comes out on her pages as a very Mephistopheles.  Klapka himself does not escape without animadversion. But without  adopting her opinions, either of the man she blames or the subject she  discusses, it cannot be denied that she has great cleverness, and a  wonderful power of exciting and interesting the reader.           *       *       *       *       *    A valuable scientific periodical is the _Geographisches Jahrbuch_ for  the Communication of all the more important New Investigations, edited  by the distinguished BERGHAUS, and published by Perthes of Gotha. The  last number has an article by the editor on the system of \"Mountains and  Rivers of Africa,\" which differs altogether from what is laid down in  the present maps. The author lays down the river Nile as flowing from  the N'Yassi, and as connected with a great number of rivers in Dar Fur,  Waday, and Fertil, with relation to which only the vaguest views have  hitherto been entertained. The article shows, too, that the newly  discovered lake N'Gami, in Southern Africa, has been long known under  the name of Nampur. The same number of the _Jahrbuch_ also contains an  article from the pen of the late lamented ALBERT GALLATIN, on the  climate of North America. This article was written in English, and was  translated into German for the _Jahrbuch_.           *       *       *       *       *    BERGHAUS has also lately issued a complete work of the highest interest,  especially now that so much attention is every where paid to  Ethnographic studies. Its title is _Grundlinien der Ethnographie_  (Outlines of Ethnography). It is in two parts, and contains a universal  tabular description of all the"]]]
