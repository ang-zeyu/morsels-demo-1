[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22620"],[0,"Researches on Cellulose, 1895-1900 (#18)"],[1,"factors of the cellulose nitric ester reaction has  been overlooked: that is, the yield calculated to the NO_{3} groups  fixed. The theoretical yields for the higher nitrates are                         Yield p.ct.    N p.ct.                      of cellulose  of nitrate      Pentanitrate        169         12.7      Hexanitrate         183         14.1    From such statistics as are recorded the yields are not in accordance  with the above. There is a sensible deficiency. Thus Will and Lenze  record a yield of 170 p.ct. for a product with 13.8 p.ct. N, indicating  a deficiency of about 10 p.ct. As the by-products soluble in the acid  mixture are extremely small, the deficiency represents approximately the  water split off by an internal reaction. In this important point the  celluloses behave as ketoses.    In the lignocelluloses the condensed constituents of the complex are of  well-marked ketonic, i.e. quinonic, type. In 'nitrating' the  lignocelluloses this phenomenon of internal condensation is much more  pronounced (see p. 131). As the reaction is mainly confined to the  cellulose of the fibre, we have this additional evidence that the  typical carbonyl is of ketonic function. It is still an open question  whether the cellulose constituents of the lignocelluloses are  progressively condensed--with progress of 'lignification'--to the  unsaturated or lignone groups. There is much in favour of this view,  the evidence being dealt with in the first edition, p. 180. The  transition from a cellulose-ketone to the lignone-ketone involves a  simple condensation without rearrangement; from which we may argue back  to the greater probability of the ketonic structure of the cellulose. We  must note, however, that the celluloses of the lignocelluloses are  obtained as residues of various reactions, and are not homogeneous. They  yield on boiling with condensing acids from 6 to 9 p.ct. furfural. It is  usual to regard furfural as invariably produced from a pentose residue.  But this interpretation ignores a number of other probable sources of  the aldehyde. It must be particularly remembered that laevulose is  readily condensed (a) to a methylhydroxyfurfural    C_{6}H_{1}O_{6} - 3H_{2}O = C_{6}H_{6}O_{3} = C_{5}(OH).H_{2}.(CH_{3})O_{2}    and (b) by HBr, with further loss of OH, as under:    C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} - 4H_{2}O + HBr = C_{5}H_{3}(CH_{2}Br)O    and generally the ketoses are distinguished from the aldoses by their  susceptibility to condensation. Such condensation of laevulose has been  effected by two methods: (a) by heating the concentrated aqueous  solution with a small proportion of oxalic acid at 3 atm. pressure  [Kiermayer, Chem. Ztg. 19, 100]; (b) by the action of hydrobromic acid  (gas) in presence of anhydrous ether; the actual compound obtained being  the omega-brommethyl derivative [Fenton, J. Chem. Soc. 1899, 423].    This latter method is being extended to the investigation of typical  celluloses, and the results appear to confirm the view that cellulose  may be of ketonic constitution.    The evidence which is obtainable from the synthetical side of the  question rests of course mainly upon the physiological basis. There are  two points which may be noted. Since the researches of Brown and Morris  (J. Chem. Soc. 1893, 604) have altered our views of the relationships of  starch and cane sugar to the assimilation process, and have placed the  latter in the position of a primary product with starch as a species of  overflow and reserve product, it appears that laevulose must play an  important part in the elaboration of cellulose. Moreover, A. J. Brown,  in studying the cellulosic cell-collecting envelope produced by the  _Bacterium xylinum_, found that the proportion of this product to the  carbohydrate disappearing under the action of the ferment was highest in  the case of laevulose. These facts being also taken into consideration  there is a concurrence of suggestion that the typical CO group in the  celluloses is of ketonic character. That the typical cotton cellulose  breaks down finally under the action of sulphuric acid to dextrose  cannot be held to prove the aldehydic position of the carbonyls in the  unit groups of the actual cellulose molecule or aggregate.    We again are confronted with the problem of the aggregate and as to how  far it may affect the constitution of the unit groups. That it modifies  the functions or reactivity of the ultimate constituent groups we have  seen from the study of the esters. Thus with the direct ester reactions  the normal fibrous cellulose (C_{6}H_{16}O_{5}) yields a monoacetate,  dibenzoate, and a trinitrate respectively under conditions which  determine, with the simple hexoses and anhydrides, the maximum  esterification, i.e. all the OH groups reacting. If the OH groups are of  variable function, we should expect the CO groups _a fortiori_ to be  susceptible of change of function, i.e. of position within the unit  groups.    But as to how far this is a problem of the constitution or phases of  constitution of the unit groups or of the aggregate under reaction we  have as yet no grounds to determine.    The subjoined communication, appearing after the completion of the MS.  of the book, and belonging to a date subsequent to the period intended  to be covered, is nevertheless included by reason of its exceptional  importance and special bearing on the constitutional problem above  discussed.      ~THE ACTION OF HYDROGEN BROMINE ON CARBOHYDRATES.~[4]    H. J. H. FENTON and MILDRED GOSTLING (J. Chem. Soc., 1901, 361).    The authors have shown in a previous communication (Trans., 1898, 73,  554) that certain classes of carbohydrates when acted upon at the  ordinary temperature with dry hydrogen bromide in ethereal solution give  an intense and beautiful purple colour.[5] It was further shown (Trans.,  1899, 75, 423) that this purple substance, when neutralised with sodium  carbonate and extracted with ether, yields golden-yellow prisms of  omega-brommethylfurfural,         CH:C.CH_{2}Br       |  |       |  O       |  |       CH:C.CHO.    This reaction is produced by laevulose, sorbose, cane sugar, and inulin,  an intense colour being given within an hour or two. Dextrose, maltose,  milk sugar, galactose, and the polyhydric alcohols give, if anything,  only insignificant colours, and these only after long standing. The  authors therefore suggested that the reaction might be employed as a  means of distinguishing these classes of carbohydrates, the rapid  production of the purple colour being indicative of _ketohexoses_, or of  substances which produce these by hydrolysis.    By relying only on the production of the purple colour, however, a  mistake might possibly arise, owing to the fact that _xylose_ gives a  somewhat similar colour after standing for a few hours. Hence, the  observations should be confirmed by isolation of the crystals of  brommethylfurfural. No trace of this substance is obtained from the  xylose product.    In order to identify the substance, the ether extract, after  neutralisation, is allowed to evaporate to a syrup, and crystallisation  promoted either by rubbing with a glass rod, or by the more certain and  highly characteristic method of 'sowing' with the most minute trace of  omega-brommethylfurfural, when crystals are almost instantly formed.  These are recrystallised from ether, or a mixture of ether and light  petroleum, and further identified by the melting-point (59.5-60.5 deg.),  and, if considered desirable, by estimation of the bromine.    It is now found, so reactive is the bromine atom in this compound, that  the estimation may be accurately made by titration with silver nitrate  according to Volhard's process, the crystals for this purpose being  dissolved in dilute alcohol:    0.1970 gram required 10.5 c.c. _N_/10 AgNO_{3}. Br = 42.63  p.ct., calculated 42.32 p.ct.    This method of applying hydrogen bromide in ethereal solution is, of  course, unsuitable for investigations where a higher temperature has to  be employed, or where long standing is necessary, since, under such  circumstances, the ether itself is attacked. Wishing to make  investigations under these conditions, the authors have tried several  solvents, and, at present, find that chloroform is best suited to the  purpose. In each of the following experiments, 10 grms. of the  substance were covered with 250 c.c. of chloroform which had been  saturated at 0 deg. with dry hydrogen bromide. The mixture was contained in  an accurately stoppered bottle, firmly secured with an iron clamp, and  heated in a water-bath to about the boiling temperature for two hours.  After standing for several hours, the mixture was treated with sodium  carbonate (first anhydrous solid, and afterwards a few drops of strong  solution), filtered, and the solution dried over calcium chloride. Most  of the chloroform was then distilled off, and the remaining solution  allowed to evaporate to a thick syrup in a weighed dish.    The product was then tested for omega-brommethylfurfural by 'sowing'  with the most minute trace of the substance, as described above. It was  then warmed on a water-oven, kept in a vacuum desiccator over solid  paraffin, and the weight estimated. When necessary, the product was  recrystallised from ether, and further identified by the tests  mentioned. The following results were obtained:                          Weight of                      crude residue.  Swedish filter paper     3.0      crystallised at once by 'sowing.'
