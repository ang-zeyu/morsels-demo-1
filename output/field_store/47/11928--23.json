Mr. S.J. Salter 'Journal Linn. Soc.' volume 6 1862 page  71.) On the other hand, in some parts of London, especially near the docks,  where fresh rats are frequently imported, an endless variety of intermediate  forms may be found between the brown, black, and snake rat, which are all  three usually ranked as distinct species.    How many generations are necessary for one species or race to absorb another  by repeated crosses has often been discussed (15/9. Sturm 'Ueber Racen, etc.'  1825 s. 107. Bronn 'Geschichte der Natur' b. 2 s. 170 gives a table of the  proportions of blood after successive crosses. Dr. P. Lucas 'L'Heredite Nat.'  tome 2 page 308.); and the requisite number has probably been much  exaggerated. Some writers have maintained that a dozen or score, or even more  generations, are necessary; but this in itself is improbable, for in the tenth  generation there would be only 1-1024th part of foreign blood in the  offspring. Gartner found (15/10. 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 463, 470.), that with  plants, one species could be made to absorb another in from three to five  generations, and he believes that this could always be effected in from six to  seven generations. In one instance, however, Kolreuter (15/11. 'Nova Acta  Petrop.' 1794 page 393: see also previous volume.) speaks of the offspring of  Mirabilis vulgaris, crossed during eight successive generations by M.  longiflora, as resembling this latter species so closely, that the most  scrupulous observer could detect \"vix aliquam notabilem differentiam\" or, as  he says, he succeeded, \"ad plenariam fere transmutationem.\" But this  expression shows that the act of absorption was not even then absolutely  complete, though these crossed plants contained only the 1-256th part of M.  vulgaris. The conclusions of such accurate observers as Gartner and Kolreuter  are of far higher worth than those made without scientific aim by breeders.  The most precise account which I have met with is given by Stonehenge (15/12.  'The Dog' 1867 pages 179-184.) and is illustrated by photographs. Mr. Hanley  crossed a greyhound bitch with a bulldog; the offspring in each succeeding  generation being recrossed with first-rate greyhounds. As Stonehenge remarks,  it might naturally be supposed that it would take several crosses to get rid  of the heavy form of the bulldog; but Hysterics, the gr-gr-granddaughter of a  bulldog, showed no trace whatever of this breed in external form. She and all  of the same litter, however, were \"remarkably deficient in stoutness, though  fast as well as clever.\" I believe clever refers to skill in turning.  Hysterics was put to a son of Bedlamite, \"but the result of the fifth cross is  not as yet, I believe, more satisfactory than that of the fourth.\" On the  other hand, with sheep, Fleischmann (15/13. As quoted in the 'True Principles  of Breeding' by C.H. Macknight and Dr. H. Madden 1865 page 11.) shows how  persistent the effects of a single cross may be: he says \"that the original  coarse sheep (of Germany) have 5500 fibres of wool on a square inch; grades of  the third or fourth Merino cross produced about 8000, the twentieth cross  27,000, the perfect pure Merino blood 40,000 to 48,000.\" So that common German  sheep crossed twenty times successively with Merino did not by any means  acquire wool as fine as that of the pure breed. But in all cases, the rate of  absorption will depend largely on the conditions of life being favourable to  any particular character; and we may suspect that there would be a constant  tendency to degeneration in the wool of Merinos under the climate of Germany,  unless prevented by careful selection; and thus perhaps the foregoing  remarkable case may be explained. The rate of absorption must also depend on  the amount of distinguishable difference between the two forms which are  crossed, and especially, as Gartner insists, on prepotency of transmission in  the one form over the other. We have seen in the last chapter that one of two  French breeds of sheep yielded up its character, when crossed with Merinos,  very much more slowly than the other; and the common German sheep referred to  by Fleischmann may be in this respect analogous. In all cases there will be  more or less liability to reversion during many subsequent generations, and it  is this fact which has probably led authors to maintain that a score or more  of generations are requisite for one race to absorb another. In considering  the final result of the commingling of two or more breeds, we must not forget  that the act of crossing in itself tends to bring back long-lost characters  not proper to the immediate parent-forms.    With respect to the influence of the conditions of life on any two breeds  which are allowed to cross freely, unless both are indigenous and have long  been accustomed to the country where they live, they will, in all probability,  be unequally affected by the conditions, and this will modify the result. Even  with indigenous breeds, it will rarely or never occur that both are equally  well adapted to the surrounding circumstances; more especially when permitted  to roam freely, and not carefully tended, as is generally the case with breeds  allowed to cross. As a consequence of this, natural selection will to a  certain extent come into action, and the best fitted will survive, and this  will aid in determining the ultimate character of the commingled body.    How long a time it would require before such a crossed body of animals would  assume a uniform character within a limited area, no one can say; that they  would ultimately become uniform from free intercrossing, and from the survival  of the fittest, we may feel assured; but the characters thus acquired would  rarely or never, as may be inferred from the previous considerations, be  exactly intermediate between those of the two parent-breeds. With respect to  the very slight differences by which the individuals of the same sub-variety,  or even of allied varieties, are characterised, it is obvious that free  crossing would soon obliterate such small distinctions. The formation of new  varieties, independently of selection, would also thus be prevented; except  when the same variation continually recurred from the action of some strongly  predisposing cause. We may therefore conclude that free crossing has in all  cases played an important part in giving uniformity of character to all the  members of the same domestic race and of the same natural species, though  largely governed by natural selection and by the direct action of the  surrounding conditions.    ON THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL ORGANIC BEINGS OCCASIONALLY INTERCROSSING.    But it may be asked, can free crossing occur with hermaphrodite animals and  plants? All the higher animals, and the few insects which have been  domesticated, have separate sexes, and must inevitably unite for each birth.  With respect to the crossing of hermaphrodites, the subject is too large for  the present volume, but in the 'Origin of Species' I have given a short  abstract of the reasons which induce me to believe that all organic beings  occasionally cross, though perhaps in some cases only at long intervals of  time. (15/14. With respect to plants, an admirable essay on this subject (Die  Geschlechter-Vertheilung bei den Pflanzen: 1867) has been published by Dr.  Hildebrand who arrives at the same general conclusions as I have done. Various  other treatises have since appeared on the same subject, more especially by  Hermann Muller and Delpino.) I will merely recall the fact that many plants,  though hermaphrodite in structure, are unisexual in function;--such as those  called by C.K. Sprengel DICHOGAMOUS, in which the pollen and stigma of the  same flower are matured at different periods; or those called by me  RECIPROCALLY DIMORPHIC, in which the flower's own pollen is not fitted to  fertilise its own stigma; or again, the many kinds in which curious mechanical  contrivances exist, effectually preventing self-fertilisation. There are,  however, many hermaphrodite plants which are not in any way specially  constructed to favour intercrossing, but which nevertheless commingle almost  as freely as animals with separated sexes. This is the case with cabbages,  radishes, and onions, as I know from having experimented on them: even the  peasants of Liguria say that cabbages must be prevented \"from falling in love\"  with each other. In the orange tribe, Gallesio (15/15. 'Teoria della  Riproduzione Vegetal' 1816 page 12.) remarks that the amelioration of the  various kinds is checked by their continual and almost regular crossing. So it  is with numerous other plants.    On the other hand, some cultivated plants rarely or never intercross, for  instance, the common pea and sweet-pea (Lathyrus odoratus); yet their flowers  are certainly adapted for cross fertilisation. The varieties of the tomato and  aubergine (Solanum) and the pimenta (Pimenta vulgaris?) are said (15/16.  Verlot 'Des Varietes' 1865 page 72.) never to cross, even when growing  alongside one another. But it should be observed that these are all exotic  plants, and we do not know how they would behave in their native country when  visited by the proper insects. With respect to the common pea, I have  ascertained that it is rarely crossed in this country owing to premature  fertilisation. There exist, however, some plants which under their natural  conditions appear to be always self-fertilised, such as the Bee Ophrys (Ophrys  apifera) and a few other Orchids; yet these plants exhibit the plainest  adaptations for cross-fertilisation. Again, some few plants are believed to  produce only closed flowers, called cleistogene, which cannot possibly be  crossed. This was long thought to be the case with the Leersia oryzoides  (15/17. Duval Jouve 'Bull. Soc. Bot. de France' tome"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28752"],[0,"Pleasures of the telescope (#18)"],[1,"e, distance 16.4\", p.  252 deg.; colors, topaz and lilac. Not far away is the closer double 42,  composed of a sixth and a seventh magnitude star, distance 1.25\", p.  350 deg.. The four-inch is capable of splitting this star, but we shall do  better to use the five-inch. In passing we may glance at the  tenth-magnitude companion to eta, distance 225\", p. 304 deg.. Another wide  pair is found in zeta, magnitudes three and nine, distance 185\", p. 40 deg..    The next step brings us to the wonderful variable omicron, or Mira,  whose changes have been watched for three centuries, the first observer  of the variability of the star having been David Fabricius in 1596. Not  only is the range of variability very great, but the period is  remarkably irregular. In the time of Hevelius, Mira was once invisible  for four years. When brightest, the star is of about the second  magnitude, and when faintest, of the ninth magnitude, but at maximum it  seldom exhibits the greatest brilliance that it has on a few occasions  shown itself capable of attaining. Ordinarily it begins to fade after  reaching the fourth or fifth magnitude. The period averages about three  hundred and thirty-one days, but is irregularly variable to the extent  of twenty-five days. Its color is red, and its spectrum shows bright  lines, which it is believed disappear when the star sinks to a minimum.  Among the various theories proposed to account for such changes as these  the most probable appears to be that which ascribes them to some cause  analogous to that operating in the production of sun spots. The  outburst of light, however, as pointed out by Scheiner, should be  regarded as corresponding to the maximum and not the minimum stage of  sun-spot activity. According to this view, the star is to be regarded as  possessing an extensive atmosphere of hydrogen, which, during the  maximum, is upheaved into enormous prominences, and the brilliance of  the light from these prominences suffices to swamp the photospheric  light, so that in the spectrum the hydrogen lines appear bright instead  of dark.    It is not possible to suppose that Mira can be the center of a system of  habitable planets, no matter what we may think of the more constant  stars in that regard, because its radiation manifestly increases more  than six hundred fold, and then falls off again to an equal extent once  in every ten or eleven months. I have met people who can not believe  that the Almighty would make a sun and then allow its energies \"to go to  waste,\" by not supplying it with a family of worlds. But I imagine that  if they had to live within the precincts of Mira Ceti they would cry out  for exemption from their own law of stellar utility.    The most beautiful double star in Cetus is gamma, magnitudes three and  seven, distance 3\", p. 288 deg.; hues, straw-color and blue. The leading  star alpha, of magnitude two and a half, has a distant blue companion  three magnitudes fainter, and between them are two minute stars, the  southernmost of which is a double, magnitudes both eleven, distance 10\",  p. 225 deg..    The variable S ranges between magnitudes seven and twelve in a somewhat  irregular period of about eleven months, while R ranges between the  seventh and the thirteenth magnitudes in a period of one hundred and  sixty-seven days.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 21.]    The constellation Eridanus, represented in map No. 21, contains a few  fine double stars, one of the most interesting of which is 12, a rather  close binary. The magnitudes are four and eight, distance 2\", p. 327 deg..  We shall take the five-inch for this, and a steady atmosphere and sharp  seeing will be necessary on account of the wide difference in the  brightness of the component stars. Amateurs frequently fail to make due  allowance for the effect of such difference. When the limit of  separating power for a telescope of a particular aperture is set at 1\"  or 2\", as the case may be, it is assumed that the stars composing the  doubles on which the test is made shall be of nearly the same magnitude,  or at least that they shall not differ by more than one or two  magnitudes at the most. The stray light surrounding a comparatively  bright star tends to conceal a faint companion, although the telescope  may perfectly separate them so far as the stellar disks are concerned.  Then, too, I have observed in my own experience that a very faint and  close double is more difficult than a brighter pair not more widely  separated, usually on account of the defect of light, and this is true  even when the components of the faint double are of equal magnitude.    Sigma 470, otherwise known as 32 Eridani, is a superb object on account  of the colors of its components, the larger star being a rich topaz and  the smaller an ultramarine; while the difference in magnitude is not as  great as in many of the colored doubles. The magnitudes are five and  seven, distance 6.7\", p. 348 deg.. The star gamma, of magnitude two and a  half, has a tenth-magnitude companion, distant 51\", p. 238 deg.. Sigma 516,  also called 39 Eridani, consists of two stars of magnitudes six and  nine, distance 6.4\", p. 150 deg.; colors, yellow and blue. The supposed  binary character of this star has not yet been established.    In omicron^2 we come upon an interesting triple star, two of whose  components at any rate we can easily see. The largest component is of  the fourth magnitude. At a distance of 82\", p. 105 deg., we find a  tenth-magnitude companion. This companion is itself double, the  magnitudes of its components being ten and eleven, distance 2.6\", p.  98 deg.. Hall says of these stars that they \"form a remarkable system.\" He  has also observed a fourth star of the twelfth magnitude, distant 45\"  from the largest star, p. 85 deg.. This is apparently unconnected with the  others, although it is only half as distant as the tenth-magnitude  component is from the primary. Sigma 590 is interesting because of the  similarity of its two components in size, both being of about the  seventh magnitude, distance 10\", p. 318 deg..    Finally, we turn to the nebula 826. This is planetary in form and  inconspicuous, but Lassell has described it as presenting a most  extraordinary appearance with his great reflector--a circular nebula  lying upon another fainter and larger nebula of a similar shape, and  having a star in its center. Yet it may possibly be an immensely distant  star cluster instead of a nebula, since its spectrum does not appear to  be gaseous.          CHAPTER VII    PISCES, ARIES, TAURUS, AND THE NORTHERN STARS    \"Now sing we stormy skies when Autumn weighs  The year, and adds to nights and shortens days,  And suns declining shine with feeble rays.\"--DRYDEN'S VIRGIL.      [Illustration: MAP NO. 22.]    The eastern end of Pisces, represented in map No. 22, includes most of  the interesting telescopic objects that the constellation contains. We  begin our exploration at the star numbered 55, a double that is very  beautiful when viewed with the three-inch glass. The components are of  magnitudes five and eight, distance 6.6\", p. 192 deg.. The larger star is  yellow and the smaller deep blue. The star 65, while lacking the  peculiar charm of contrasted colors so finely displayed in 55, possesses  an attraction in the equality of its components which are both of the  sixth magnitude and milk-white. The distance is 4.5\", p. 118 deg.. In 66 we  find a swift binary whose components are at present far too close for  any except the largest telescopes. The distance in 1894 was only 0.36\",  p. 329 deg.. The magnitudes are six and seven. In contrast with this  excessively close double is psi, whose components are both of magnitude  five and a half, distance 30\", p. 160 deg.. Dropping down to 77 we come upon  another very wide and pleasing double, magnitudes six and seven,  distance 33\", p. 82 deg., colors white and lilac or pale blue. Hardly less  beautiful is zeta magnitudes five and six, distance 24\", p. 64 deg.. Finest  of all is alpha, which exhibits a remarkable color contrast, the larger  star being greenish and the smaller blue. The magnitudes are four and  five, distance 3\", p. 320 deg.. This star is a binary, but the motion is  slow. The variable R ranges between magnitudes seven and thirteen,  period three hundred and forty-four days.    The constellation Aries contains several beautiful doubles, all but one  of which are easy for our smallest aperture. The most striking of these  is gamma, which is historically interesting as the first double star  discovered. The discovery was made by Robert Hooke in 1664 by accident,  while he was following the comet of that year with his telescope. He  expressed great surprise on noticing that the glass divided the star,  and remarked that he had not met with a like instance in all the  heavens. His observations could not have been very extensive or very  carefully conducted, for there are many double stars much wider than  gamma Arietis which Hooke could certainly have separated if he had  examined them. The magnitudes of the components of gamma are four and  four and a half, or, according to Hall, both four; distance 8.5\", p.  180 deg.. A few degrees above gamma, passing by beta, is a wide double  lambda, magnitudes five and eight, distance 37\", p. 45 deg., colors white  and lilac or violet. Three stars are to be seen in 14: magnitudes five  and a half, ten, and nine, distances 83\", p. 36 deg., and 106\", p. 278 deg.,  colors white, blue, and lilac. The star 30 is a very pretty double,  magnitudes six and seven, distance 38.6\", p. 273 deg.. Sigma 289 consists of  a topaz star combined with a sapphire, magnitudes six and nine, distance  28.5\", p. 0 deg.. The fourth-magnitude star 41 has several faint companions.  The magnitudes of two of these are eleven and nine, distances 34\", p.  203 deg., and 130\", p. 230 deg.. We discover another triple in pi, magnitudes  five, eight, and eleven,"]]]
