As  for the provisions, you threw over a lot; didn't you, Tom?\"    \"Well, I had to.\"    \"Yes, I guess you did. Well, we'll make a landing.\"    \"Do you think it will be safe?\" asked Mr. Damon anxiously. \"We might be  fired upon again.\"    \"Oh, there's no danger of that. But I'll take precautions. I don't want  a big crowd around when we come down, so we'll pick out a secluded  place and land just at dusk. Then in the morning we can look over the  ship, and go to the nearest town to buy provisions. After that we can  continue our journey, and we'll steer clear of forest fires after this.\"    \"And people who shoot at us,\" added Mr. Damon.    \"Yes. I wish I knew what that was done for,\" and once again came that  puzzled look to the face of the balloonist.    The airship gently descended that evening in a large level field, a  good landing being made. Just before the descent Tom took an  observation and located, about two miles from the spot they selected  for an \"anchorage,\" a good-sized village.    \"We can get provisions there,\" he announced.    \"Yes, but we must not let it be known what they are for,\" said Mr.  Sharp, \"or we'll have the whole population out here. I think this will  be a good plan: Tom, you and Mr. Damon go into town and buy the things  we need. I'll stay here with the airship, and look it all over. You can  arrange to have the stuff carted out here in the morning, and left at a  point say about a quarter of a mile away. Then we can carry it to the  ship. In that way no one will discover us, and we'll not be bothered  with curiosity-seekers.\"    This was voted a good idea, and, when the landing had been made, and a  hasty examination showed that the ship had suffered no great damage  from the passage over the fire, the young inventor and Mr. Damon  started off.    They soon found a good road, leading to town, and tramped along it in  the early evening. The few persons they met paid little attention to  them, save to bow in a friendly fashion, and, occasionally wish them  good evening.    \"I wonder where we are?\" asked Tom, as they hurried along.    \"In some southern town, to judge by the voices of the people, and the  number of colored individuals we've met,\" answered Mr. Damon.    \"Let's ask,\" suggested Tom.    \"No, if you do they'll know we're strangers, and they may ask a lot of  questions.\"    \"Oh, I guess if it's a small place they'll know we're strangers soon  enough,\" commented Tom. \"But when we get to the village itself we can  read the name on the store windows.\"    A few minutes later found them in the midst of a typical southern town.  It was Berneau, North Carolina, according to the signs, they saw.    \"Here's a restaurant,\" called Tom, as they passed a neat-appearing one.  \"Let's go inside and get some supper before we buy our supplies.\"    \"Good!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"Bless my flapjacks, but I am beginning to  feel hungry.\"    The eating place was a good one, and Tom's predictions about their  being taken for strangers was verified, for, no sooner had they given  their orders than the pretty, white girl, who waited on the table  remarked:    \"Ah reckon yo' all are from th' no'th; aren't yo'?\" She smiled, as she  spoke, and Tom smiled back as he acknowledged it.    \"Have you a paper--a newspaper I could look at?\" he asked.    \"Ah guess Ah can find one,\" went on the girl. \"Ah reckon yo' all are  from N' York. N' Yorkers are so desperant bent on readin' th' news.\"  Her tones were almost like those of a colored person.    \"Yes, we're from a part of New York,\" was Tom's reply.    When a newspaper was brought to him, after they had nearly finished  their meal, the young inventor rapidly scanned the pages. Something on  the front sheet, under a heading of big, black type caught his eye. He  started as he read it.        WANTED FOR ROBBERY!    BANK LOOTERS ESCAPE IN RED AIRSHIP--FIRED AT    BUT DISAPPEAR      \"Great Jehosophat!\" exclaimed Tom, in a low voice. \"What on earth can  this mean?\"    \"What?\" inquired Mr. Damon. \"Has anything happened?\"    \"Happened? I should say there had,\" was the answer. \"Why, we're accused  of having robbed the Shopton Bank of seventy-five thousand dollars the  night before we left, and to have taken it away in the Red Cloud.  There's a general alarm out for us! Why this is awful!\"    \"It's preposterous!\" burst out Mr. Damon. \"I'll have my lawyers sue  this paper. Bless my stocks and bonds, I!\"    \"Hush! Not so loud,\" cautioned Tom, for the pretty waitress was  watching them curiously. \"Here, read this, and then we'll decide what  to do. But one thing is certain, we must go back to Shopton at once to  clear ourselves of this accusation.\"    \"Ha!\" murmured Mr. Damon, as he read the article rapidly. \"Now I know  why they fired at us. They hoped to bring us down, capture us, and get  the five thousand dollars reward!\"          Chapter 18    Back For Vindication      Tom glanced around the restaurant. There were few persons in it save  himself and Mr. Damon. The pretty waitress was still regarding the two  curiously.    \"We ought to take that paper along with us, to show to Mr. Sharp,\" said  Tom, in a low voice to his friend. \"I haven't had time to take it all  in myself, yet. Let's go. I've had enough to eat, haven't you?\"    \"Yes. My appetite is gone now.\"    As they arose, to pay their checks the girl advanced.    \"Can you tell me where I can get a copy of this paper?\" asked Tom, as  he laid down a generous tip on the table, for the girl. Her eyes opened  rather wide.    \"Yo' all are fo'gettin' some of yo' money,\" she said, in her broad,  southern tones. Tom thought her the prettiest girl he ever seen,  excepting Mary Nestor.    \"Oh, that's for you,\" replied the young inventor. \"It's a tip. Aren't  you in the habit of getting them down here?\"    \"Not very often. Thank yo' all. But what did yo' all ask about that  paper?\"    \"I asked where I could get a copy of it. There is something in it that  interests me.\"    \"Yes, an' Ah reckon Ah knows what it is,\" exclaimed the girl. \"It's  about that airship with th' robbers in it!\"    \"How do you know?\" inquired Tom quickly, and he tried to seem cool,  though he felt the hot blood mounting to his cheeks.    \"Oh, Ah saw yo' all readin' it. Everybody down heah is crazy about it.  We all think th' ship is comin' down this way, 'cause it says th'  robbers was intendin' to start south befo' they robbed th' bank. Ah  wish Ah could collect thet five thousand dollars. If Ah could see that  airship, I wouldn't work no mo' in this eatin' place. What do yo' all  reckon thet airship looks like?\" and the girl gazed intently at Tom and  Mr. Damon.    \"Why, bless my--\" began the eccentric man, but Tom broke in hurriedly:    \"Oh, I guess it looks like most any other airship,\" for he feared that  if his companion used any of his odd expressions he might be  recognized, since our hero had not had time to read the article in the  paper through, and was not sure whether or not a description of  himself, Mr. Damon and Mr. Sharp was given.    \"Well, Ah suah wish I could collect thet reward,\" went on the girl.  \"Everybody is on th' lookout. Yo' all ain't see th' airship; have yo'  all?\"    \"Where can we get a paper like this?\" asked Tom, again, not wanting to  answer such a leading question.    \"Why, yo' all is suah welcome to that one,\" was the reply. \"Ah guess Ah  can affo'd to give it to yo' all, after th' generous way yo' all  behaved to me. Take it, an' welcome. But are yo' all suah yo' are done  eatin'? Yo' all left lots.\"    \"Oh, we had enough,\" replied Tom hurriedly. His sole aim now was to get  away--to consult with Mr. Sharp, and he needed the paper to learn  further details of the astonishing news. He and his friends accused of  looting the bank, and taking away seventy-five thousand dollars in the  airship! It was incredible! A reward of five thousand dollars offered  for their capture! They might be arrested any minute, yet they could  not go on without buying some provisions. What were they to do?    Once outside the restaurant, Mr. Damon and Tom walked swiftly on. They  came to a corner where there was a street lamp, and there the young  inventor paused to scan the paper again. It was the copy of a journal  published in the nearby county seat, and contained quite a full account  of the affair.    The story was told of how the bank had been broken into, the vault  rifled and the money taken. The first clue, it said, was given by a  youth named Andy Foger, who had seen a former acquaintance hanging  around the bank with burglar tools. Tom recognized the description of  himself as the \"former acquaintance,\" but he could not understand the  rest.    \"Burglar tools? I wonder how Andy could say that?\" he asked Mr. Damon.    \"Wait until we get back, and we'll ask John Sharp,\" suggested his  companion. \"This is very strange. I am going to sue some one for  spreading false reports about me! Bless my ledgers, why I have money on  deposit in that bank! To think that I would rob it!\"    \"Poor dad!\" murmured Tom. \"This must be hard for him. But what about  ordering food? Maybe if we buy any they will trail us, find the airship  and capture it. I don't want to be arrested, even if I am innocent, and  I certainly don't want the airship to fall into the hands of the  police.

(Too often, the old and new versions     cannot definitively be distinguished, such that lingering instances of     the previous ones yield crashes or other infelicitous effects, as     opposed to a simple \"version mismatch\" message.) A backwards     compatible change, on the other hand, allows old versions to coexist     without crashes or error messages, but too many major changes     incorporating elaborate backwards compatibility processing can lead to     extreme [977]software bloat.

[Durham, UK] Said of something that is both badly designed and wrongly     executed. This common term is the prototype of, and is used by     contrast with, three less common terms - Bad and Right (a kludge,     something ugly but functional); Good and Wrong (an overblown GUI or     other attractive nuisance); and (rare praise) Good and Right. These     terms entered common use at Durham c.1994 and may have been imported     from elsewhere; they are also in use at Oxford, and the emphatic form     \"Evil, Bad and Wrong\" (abbreviated EBW) is reported fromm there. There     are standard abbreviations: they start with B&R, a typo for \"Bad and     Wrong\". Consequently, B&W is actually \"Bad and Right\", G&R = \"Good and     Wrong\", and G&W = \"Good and Right\".

[Georgia Tech] A \"baggy pantsing\" is used to reprimand hackers who     incautiously leave their terminals unlocked. The affected user will     come back to find a post from them on internal newsgroups discussing     exactly how baggy their pants are, an accepted stand-in for     \"unattentive user who left their work unprotected in the clusters\". A     properly-done baggy pantsing is highly mocking and humorous (see     examples below). It is considered bad form to post a baggy pantsing to     off-campus newsgroups or the more technical, serious groups. A     particularly nice baggy pantsing may be \"claimed\" by immediately     quoting the message in full, followed by your sig; this has the added     benefit of keeping the embarassed victim from being able to delete the     post. Interesting baggy-pantsings have been done involving adding     commands to login scripts to repost the message every time the unlucky     user logs in; Unix boxes on the residential network, when cracked,     oftentimes have their homepages replaced (after being politely     backedup to another file) with a baggy-pants message; .plan files are     also occasionally targeted.
