Violation    of the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000    in fines and one year in prison. The Departments of Treasury,    Commerce, Transportation, and Interior share enforcement    responsibilities. Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation    Act of 1978, requires expeditions from the US to Antarctica to    notify, in advance, the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room    5801, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, which reports such    plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty.

Economy        Economy--overview: No economic activity is conducted at present,    except for fishing off the coast and small-scale tourism, both based    abroad. Antarctic fisheries in 1997-98 reported landing 92,456    metric tons. Unregulated fishing landed five to six times more than    the regulated fishery, and allegedly illegal fishing in antarctic    waters in 1998 resulted in the seizure (by France and Australia) of    at least eight fishing ships. A total of 9,604 tourists visited in    the 1997-98 summer, up from the 7,413 who visited the previous year.    Nearly all of them were passengers on 13 commercial    (nongovernmental) ships that made 92 trips during the summer. Around    200 tourists were on yachts or commercial aircraft. Most tourist    trips lasted approximately two weeks.

Do  you mean Prince, Phronsie?\"    \"No, I don't mean Princey,\" said the child decisively; \"I mean my sick  man.\"    \"It's Jasper's father, I guess she means,\" said Mrs. Pepper over in the  corner; \"but what in the world!\"    \"Yes, yes,\" cried Phronsie, perfectly delighted at being at last  understood, and hopping on one toe; \"my sick man.\"    \"I shall give up!\" said Polly, tumbling over in a chair, with the cake  spoon in her hand, from which a small sticky lump fell on her apron,  which Joel immediately pounced upon and devoured. \"What do you want to  bake, Phronsie?\" she gasped, holding the spoon sticking up straight, and  staring at the child.    \"A gingerbread boy,\" said the child, promptly; \"he'd like that best;  poor, sick man!\" and she commenced to climb up to active preparations.          A LETTER TO JASPER      \"Mamsie, what shall we do?\" implored Polly of her mother.    \"I don't know,\" said her mother; \"however did that get into her head, do  you suppose?\"    \"I am sure I can't tell,\" said Polly, jumping up and beginning to stir  briskly to make up for lost time. \"P'r'aps she heard us talking about  Jasper's having to take care of his sick father, and how hard it must be  to be sick away from home.\"    \"Yes,\" said Phronsie, \"but he'll be glad to see my gingerbread boy, I  guess; poor, sick man.\"    \"Oh, Phronsie,\" cried Polly, in great distress, \"you aren't ever going  to make a 'gingerbread boy' to-day! see, we'll put in a cunning little  cake for Mr. King--full of raisins, Phronsie; won't that be lovely!\"  and Polly began to fill a little scalloped tin with some of the cake  mixture.    \"N-no,\" said the child, eying it suspiciously; \"that isn't like a  'gingerbread boy,' Polly; he'll like that best.\"    \"Mamsie,\" said Polly, \"we can't let her make a dreadful, horrid  'gingerbread boy' to send Mr. King! he never'll let Jasper come here  again.\"    \"Oh, let her,\" cried Joel; \"she can bake it, and Dave an' I'll eat it,\"  and he picked up a raisin that had fallen under the table and began  crunching it with great gusto.    \"That wouldn't be fair,\" said Polly, gloomily. \"Do get her off from it,  mammy.\"    \"Phronsie,\" said Mrs. Pepper, going up back of the child, who sat  patiently in her high chair waiting for Polly to let her begin, \"hadn't  you rather wait and give your 'gingerbread boy' to Jasper for his  father, when he comes?\"    \"Oh, no, no,\" cried Phronsie, twisting in her chair in great  apprehension, \"I want to send it now, I do.\"    \"Well, Polly,\" said her mother, laughing, \"after all it's best, I think,  to let her; it can't do any harm anyway--and instead of Mr. King's  not letting Jasper come, if he's a sensible man that won't make any  difference; and if he isn't, why, then there'd be sure to something come  up sometime to make trouble.\"    \"Well,\" said Polly, \"I suppose she's got to; and perhaps,\" as a  consoling idea struck her, \"perhaps she'll want to eat it up herself  when it's done. Here, Phronsie,\" giving her a handful of the cake  mixture, which she stiffened with flour to the right thickness, \"there,  you can call that a 'gingerbread boy;' see, won't it make a beautiful  one!\"    \"You needn't think,\" said Mrs. Pepper, seeing Phronsie's delighted face,  and laughing as she went back to her work, \"but what that gingerbread  boy'll go?\"    When the little cakes were done, eight of them, and set upon the table  for exhibition, they one and all protested that they never saw so fine a  lot. Polly was delighted with the praise they received, and her mother's  commendation that she was \"growing a better cook every day.\" \"How glad  Jasper'll be, won't he, mamsie?\" said she.    The children walked around and around the table, admiring and pointing  out the chief points of attraction, as they appeared before their  discriminating eyes.    \"I should choose that one,\" said Joel, pointing at one which was  particularly plummy, with a raisin standing up on one end with a festive  air, as if to say, \"there's lots of us inside, you better believe!\"    \"I wouldn't,\" said Davie, \"I'd have that--that's cracked so pretty.\"    \"So 'tis,\" said Mrs. Pepper; \"they're all as light as a feather, Polly.\"    \"But my 'gingerbread boy,\" cried Phronsie, running eagerly along with a  particularly ugly looking specimen of a cake figure in her hand, \"is the  be-yew-tifullest, isn't it, Polly?\"    \"Oh, dear,\" groaned Polly, \"it looks just awfully, don't it, Ben!\"    \"Hoh, hoh!\" laughed Joel in derision; \"his leg is crooked, see  Phronsie--you better let Davie an' me have it.\"    \"No, no,\" screamed the child in terror; \"that's my sick man's  'gingerbread boy,' it is!\"    \"Joe, put it down,\" said Ben. \"Yes, Phronsie, you shall have it; there,  it's all safe;\" and he put it carefully into Phronsie's apron, when she  breathed easier.    \"And he hasn't but one eye,\" still laughed Joel, while little Davie  giggled too.    \"He did have two,\" said Polly, \"but she punched the other in with her  thumb; don't, boys,\" she said, aside, \"you'll make her feel bad; do stop  laughing. Now, how'll we send the things?\"    \"Put 'em in a basket,\" said Ben; \"that's nicest.\"    \"But we haven't got any basket,\" said Polly, \"except the potato basket,  and they'd be lost in that.\"    \"Can't we take your work-basket, mamsie?\" asked Ben; \"they'd look so  nice in that.\"    \"Oh,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"that wouldn't do; I couldn't spare it, and  besides, it's all broken at the side, Ben; that don't look nice.\"    \"Oh, dear,\" said Polly, sitting down on one of the hard wooden chairs  to think, \"I do wish we had things nice to send to sick people.\" And her  forehead puckered up in a little hard knot.    \"We'll have to do 'em up in a paper, Polly,\" said Ben; \"there isn't  any other way; they'll look nice in anything, 'cause they are nice,\" he  added, comfortingly.    \"If we only had some flowers,\" said Polly, \"that would set 'em off.\"    \"You're always a-thinkin' of flowers, Polly,\" said Ben. \"I guess the  cakes'll have to go without 'em.\"    \"I suppose they will,\" said Polly, stifling a little sigh. \"Where's the  paper?\"    \"I've got a nice piece up-stairs,\" said Ben, \"just right; I'll get it.\"    \"Put my 'gingerbread boy' on top,\" cried Phronsie, handing him up.    So Polly packed the little cakes neatly in two rows, and laid the  'gingerbread boy' in a fascinating attitude across the top.    \"He looks as if he'd been struck by lightning!\" said Ben, viewing him  critically as he came in the door with the paper.    \"Be still,\" said Polly, trying not to laugh; \"that's because he baked so  funny; it made his feet stick out.\"    \"Children,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"how'll Jasper know where the cakes come  from?\"    \"Why, he'll know it's us,\" said Polly, \"of course; 'cause it'll make him  think of the baking we're going to have when he gets well.\"    \"Well, but you don't say so,\" said Mrs. Pepper, smiling; \"tisn't polite  to send it this way.\"    \"Whatever'll we do, mammy!\" said all four children in dismay, while  Phronsie simply stared. \"Can't we send 'em at all?\"    \"Why yes,\" said their mother; \"I hope so, I'm sure, after you've got 'em  baked; but you might answer Jasper's letter I should think, and tell him  about 'em, and the 'gingerbread boy'.\"    \"Oh dear,\" said Polly, ready to fly, \"I couldn't mamsie; I never wrote a  letter.\"    \"Well, you never had one before, did you?\" said her mother, composedly  biting her thread. \"Never say you can't, Polly, 'cause you don't know  what you can do till you've tried.\"    \"You write, Ben,\" said Polly, imploringly.    \"No,\" said Ben, \"I think the nicest way is for all to say somethin',  then 'twon't be hard for any of us.\"    \"Where's the paper,\" queried Polly, \"coming from, I wonder!\"    \"Joel,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"run to the bureau in the bedroom, and open  the top drawer, and get a green box there.\"    So Joel, quite important at the errand, departed, and presently put the  designated box into his mother's hand.    \"There, now I'm going to give you this,\" and she took out a small sheet  of paper slightly yellowed by age; but being gilt-edged, it looked very  magnificent to the five pairs of eyes directed to it.    \"Now Ben, you get the ink bottle and the pen, and then go to work.\"    So Ben reached down from the upper shelf in the cupboard the ink bottle,  and a pen in a black wooden penholder.    \"Oh, mamsie,\" cried Polly, \"that's where Phronsie bit it off when she  was a baby, isn't it?\" holding up the stubby end where the little ball  had disappeared.    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"and now you're going to write about her  'gingerbread boy' with it--well, time goes, to be sure.\" And she bent  over her work again, harder than ever. Poor woman! if she could only  scrape together enough money to get her children into school--that was  the earnest wish of her heart. She must do it soon, for Ben was twelve  years old; but with all her strivings and scrimpings she could only  manage to put bread into their mouths, and live from day to day. \"I know  I ought to be thankful for that,\" she said to herself, not taking time  even to cry over her troubles. \"But oh, the learning! they must have  that!\"    \"Now,\" said Polly, \"how'll we do it Ben?\" as they ranged themselves  around the table, on which reposed the cakes; \"you begin.\"    \"How do folks begin a letter?\" asked Ben in despair, of his mother.    \"How did Jasper begin his?\" asked Mrs. Pepper back again. \"Oh,\" cried  Polly, running into the bedroom to get the precious missive. \"Dear Miss  Polly'--that's what it says.\"    \"Well,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"then you'd better say, 'Dear Mister  Jasper'--or you might say, 'Dear Mr. King.'\"    \"Oh, dear!\" cried Polly, \"that would be the father then--s'pose "]]]
