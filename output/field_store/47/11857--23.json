He has  angels and archangels, the hosts of the just made perfect, for his  familiar friends, but he has at the same time found a new kinship with  the prone children of men, who stumble and sin in the dark. Finding  sinlessness, he finds also that the world's sin and shame are his, not to  share, but to atone; finding kinship with angels, he likewise finds his  part in the toil of angels, the toil for the redemption of the world.    For this work, he, who now stands in the heavenly realm, needs his  instrument on earth; and this instrument he finds, ready to his hand,  and fitted and perfected by the very struggles he has waged against it,  in the personality, the \"mind,\" of the personal man. This once tyrant is  now his servant and perfect ambassador, bearing witness, before men,  of heavenly things and even in this present world doing the will and  working the works of the Father.    25. For him who discerns between the Mind and the Spiritual Man,  there comes perfect fruition of the longing after the real being of the  Self.    How many times in the long struggle have the Soul's aspirations  seemed but a hopeless, impossible dream, a madman's counsel of  perfection. Yet every finest, most impossible aspiration shall be  realized, and ten times more than realized, once the long, arduous  fight against the \"mind,\" and the mind's worldview is won. And then  it will be seen that unfaith and despair were but weapons of the  \"mind,\" to daunt the Soul, and put off the day when the neck of the  \"mind\" shall be put under the foot of the Soul.    Have you aspired, well-nigh hopeless, after immortality? You shall be  paid by entering the immortality of God.    Have you aspired, in misery and pain, after consoling, healing love?  You shall be made a dispenser of the divine love of God Himself to  weary souls.    Have you sought ardently, in your day of feebleness, after power?  You shall wield power immortal, infinite, with God working the works  of God.    Have you, in lonely darkness, longed for companionship and  consolation? You shall have angels and archangels for your friends,  and all the immortal hosts of the Dawn.    These are the fruits of victory. Therefore overcome. These are the  prizes of regeneration. Therefore die to self, that you may rise again  to God.    26. Thereafter, the whole personal being bends toward illumination,  toward Eternal Life.    This is part of the secret of the Soul, that salvation means, not merely  that a soul shall be cleansed and raised to heaven, but that the whole  realm of the natural powers shall be redeemed, building up, even in  this present world, the kingly figure of the Spiritual Man.    The traditions of the ages are full of his footsteps; majestic,  uncomprehended shadows, myths, demi-gods, fill the memories of all  the nobler peoples. But the time cometh, when he shall be known, no  longer demi-god, nor myth, nor shadow, but the ever-present  Redeemer, working amid men for the life and cleansing of all souls.    27. In the internals of the batik, other thoughts will arise, through the  impressions of the dynamic mind-images.    The battle is long and arduous. Let there be no mistake as to that. Go  not forth to this battle without counting the cost. Ages have gone to  the strengthening of the foe. Ages of conflict must be spent, ere the  foe, wholly conquered, becomes the servant, the Soul's minister to  mankind.    And from these long past ages, in hours when the contest flags, will  come new foes, mind-born children springing up to fight for mind,  reinforcements coming from forgotten years, forgotten lives. For once  this conflict is begun, it can be ended only by sweeping victory, and  unconditional, unreserved surrender of the vanquished.    28. These are to be overcome as it was taught that hindrances should  be overcome.    These new enemies and fears are to be overcome by ceaselessly  renewing the fight, by a steadfast, dogged persistence, whether in  victory or defeat, which shall put the stubbornness of the rocks to  shame. For the Soul is older than all things, and invincible; it is of the  very nature of the Soul to be unconquerable.    Therefore fight on, undaunted; knowing that the spiritual will, once  awakened, shall, through the effort of the contest, come to its full  strength; that ground gained can be held permanently; that great as is  the dead-weight of the adversary, it is yet measurable, while the  Warrior who fights for you, for whom you fight, is, in might,  immeasurable, invincible, everlasting.    29. He who, after he has attained, is wholly free from self, reaches the  essence of all that can be known, gathered together like a cloud. This  is the true spiritual consciousness.    It has been said that, at the beginning of the way, we must kill out  ambition, the great curse, the giant weed which grows as strongly in  the heart of the devoted disciple as in the man of desire. The remedy  is sacrifice of self, obedience, humility; that purity of heart which gives  the vision of God. Thereafter, he who has attained is wrapt about with  the essence of all that can be known, as with a cloud; he has that  perfect illumination which is the true spiritual consciousness. Through  obedience to the will of God, he comes into oneness of being with  God; he is initiated into God's view of the universe, seeing all life as  God sees it.    30. Thereon comes surcease from sorrow and the burden of toil.    Such a one, it is said, is free from the bond of Karma, from the burden  of toil, from that debt to works which comes from works done in  self-love and desire. Free from self-will, he is free from sorrow, too,  for sorrow comes from the fight of self-will against the divine will,  through the correcting stress of the divine will, which seeks to  counteract the evil wrought by disobedience. When the conflict with  the divine will ceases, then sorrow ceases, and he who has grown into  obedience, thereby enters into joy.    31. When all veils are rent, all stains washed away, his knowledge  becomes infinite; little remains for him to know.    The first veil is the delusion that thy soul is in some permanent way  separate from the great Soul, the divine Eternal. When that veil is rent,  thou shalt discern thy oneness with everlasting Life. The second veil  is the delusion of enduring separateness from thy other selves,  whereas in truth the soul that is in them is one with the soul that is in  thee. The world's sin and shame are thy sin and shame: its joy also.    These veils rent, thou shalt enter into knowledge of divine things and  human things. Little will remain unknown to thee.    32. Thereafter comes the completion of the series of transformations  of the three nature potencies, since their purpose is attained.    It is a part of the beauty and wisdom of the great Indian teachings, the  Vedanta and the Yoga alike, to hold that all life exists for the purposes  of Soul, for the making of the spiritual man. They teach that all nature  is an orderly process of evolution, leading up to this, designed for this  end, existing only for this: to bring forth and perfect the Spiritual Man.  He is the crown of evolution: at his coming, the goal of all  development is attained.    33. The series of transformations is divided into moments. When the  series is completed, time gives place to duration.    There are two kinds of eternity, says the commentary: the eternity of  immortal life, which belongs to the Spirit, and the eternity of change,  which inheres in Nature, in all that is not Spirit. While we are content  to live in and for Nature, in the Circle of Necessity, Sansara, we doom  ourselves to perpetual change. That which is born must die, and that  which dies must be reborn. It is change evermore, a ceaseless series  of transformations.    But the Spiritual Man enters a new order; for him, there is no longer  eternal change, but eternal Being. He has entered into the joy of his  Lord. This spiritual birth, which makes him heir of the Everlasting,  sets a term to change; it is the culmination, the crowning  transformation, of the whole realm of change.    34. Pure spiritual life is, therefore, the inverse resolution of the  potencies of Nature, which have emptied themselves of their value for  the Spiritual man; or it is the return of the power of pure  Consciousness to its essential form.    Here we have a splendid generalization, in which our wise philosopher  finally reconciles the naturalists and the idealists, expressing the crown  and end of his teaching, first in the terms of the naturalist, and then in  the terms of the idealist.    The birth and growth of the Spiritual Man, and his entry into his  immortal heritage, may be regarded, says our philosopher, either as  the culmination of the whole process of natural evolution and  involution, where \"that which flowed from out the boundless deep,  turns again home\"; or it may be looked at, as the Vedantins look at it,  as the restoration of pure spiritual Consciousness to its pristine and  essential form. There is no discrepancy or conflict between these two  views, which are but two accounts of the same thing. Therefore those  who study the wise philosopher, be they naturalist or idealist, have no  excuse to linger over dialectic subtleties or disputes. These things are  lifted from their path, lest they should be tempted to delay over them,  and they are left facing the path itself, stretching upward and onward  from their feet to the everlasting hills, radiant with infinite Light."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25266"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Paul (#18)"],[1,"without the use of coal, at Lamberhurst on the Kent and Sussex border,  have been removed, and, after suffering shipwreck, now enclose a  monument at Toronto. We can but regret that some second home was not  found in London for such a specimen of an extinct industry: but the  throwing open of the area, so that justice might be done to the view  of the cathedral, is in strict accordance with Wren's views. So is the  present arrangement of the steps. In the landing the red marble is  from Laconia, in Southern Greece, the dark grey from Porto Venere,  near La Spezia, in Italy, and the granite from Shap, in Westmoreland.    Posterity may be thankful that Wren was allowed a free hand in  departing from the Accepted Design, and in carrying out his more fully  developed conceptions. The well worked out designs of the different  parts and details, and the combination of these into one harmonious  whole with the dome for a background, leave nothing to be desired.[86]    Before leaving, the visitor may stand by Queen Anne's statue and  reflect that near that very spot was erected the scaffold on which  suffered Sir Everard Digby, Robert Wynter, John Grant, and Thomas  Bates, for their share in the Gunpowder Plot. Digby was said to have  been the handsomest man of his day. He died \"penitent and sorrowful  for his vile treason,\" as did all save Grant.    =The Dome.=--To the end, Wren's wish seems to have been to have made  the external height no greater than was required by the formation of  the internal cupola. \"_The old Church having had before a very lofty  Spire of Timber and Lead, the World expected that the new Work should  not in this Respect fall short of the old (tho' that was but a Spit  and this a Mountain). He was therefore obliged to comply with the  Humour of the Age, (though not with ancient Example, as neither did  Bramante) and to raise another Structure over the first Cupola._\"  Stephen might have said _two_ other structures. Not only did Wren wish  the interior height to be somewhat less, so as to make it more perfect  for the purpose of an auditorium, but he thought any greater exterior  height unnecessary, and would have finished off the exterior elevation  in some other way.    As matters eventuated, he raised the internal sphere so that the  disproportion with the external might be reduced. The whole dome has  three shells. (_a_) The majestic exterior visible to the eye, an  outward roof of wood covered with lead and ribbed for the sake of  ornament. (_b_) The intermediate brick cone which supports the lantern  and its accessories of 700 tons weight. This springs from the level of  the stone gallery, and rises in straight lines which converge at the  circular opening beneath the lantern. This, although seen neither from  the outside or from within, constitutes the most solid and substantial  part. Between this and the outside visible shell is an ingenious  network of beams supporting the latter, and at the base of this  network a strengthening of which the account had better be given in  Stephen's own words: \"_Altho' the Dome wants not Butment, yet for  greater Caution, it is hooped with Iron in this Manner; a Chanel is  cut in the Bandage of Portland-Stone, in which is laid a double Chain  of Iron strongly linked together at every ten Feet, and the whole  Chanel filled up with Lead._\"[87] (_c_) The interior dome, also of  brick. The height of this third and smallest shell reaches only to the  level of the curved lines of the fluted patterns of the exterior  shell, a difference of from fifty to sixty feet.       [Illustration: SECTION OF THE DOME.]    Since the outside cupola does not bear the heavy weight of the lantern  it has been denounced as a sham, but this is an exaggeration. It is  evident, as we look at it, that it is incapable of bearing any such  weight. Much more practical is the objection of Gwilt that the  elaborate framework of beams supporting this outside cover is certain  to decay in course of time. A third objection is that of  deception--the exterior and interior are presumed to be one and the  same. This is not correct. Neither roof nor steeple is assumed to have  such correspondence, and Wren might surely be allowed a like liberty  with his dome. As Mr. Wightwick very properly says, it will be time  enough to find fault when the roofs of churches are the same outside  as within.    The Romans are credited with first applying the Dome to larger  buildings. It travelled eastward to Constantinople, and was in use in  Italy during mediaeval times. The word \"Dome\" is derived from the  _Duomo_ of Florence, where Brunelleschi covered in the octagon with  his famous cupola in the earlier part of the fifteenth century.[88]  But Wren's particular study was the Pantheon, which we have no  evidence whatever that he saw; and, indeed, he erected his dome  without having ever seen, so far as we know, anything like it.    A few words will suffice for the main features. The first stage of the  superstructure is the Stylobate, of 25 feet in height and some 140 to  145 feet in diameter. The next, the Peristyle or Colonnade which  lights up the interior. It has thirty-two Composite columns of a  height of 38 feet, including the pedestals. Every fourth  intercolumnation is filled up with an ornamental niche (if the term be  allowable for a recess of the size) to hide the supports behind. This  alternation, while it agreeably affects the play of light and shade,  yet allows a partial glimpse of the supports. Why could not Wren have  done as much with his curtain wall? Above the peristyle comes the  Stone Gallery with its balustrade--a great attraction for  visitors--just about half-way up to the summit of the cross. Here the  diameter decreases by the breadth of the gallery to 108 feet, and the  Tholobate[89] rises. It has pilasters, with lights between, in the  upper parts. Above is the outer dome proper--the spherical part--with  a further contraction to 102 feet. Wren had the advantage of St.  Peter's to profit by, and abstained from inserting the \"luthern\"  lights of the larger edifice. The absence of these and the ribbing of  the lead coating was, in his opinion, \"less Gothic.\" The lights,  again, could not easily have been reached for repairs; and if left  unrepaired would have been the means of causing injury to the  supporting timbers underneath. The effect, no doubt, is better, and  the lighting above and below sufficient for the stairs leading to the  lantern.       [Illustration: _Photo. S.B. Bolas & Co._     THE LANTERN, FROM THE CLOCK TOWER.]    =The Lantern.=--The Golden Gallery is almost exactly a hundred feet  above the Stone Gallery. The Lantern is an elegant and graceful piece  of design and workmanship, and consists of three square stages, each  of them with lights and with recesses (or chamfered, so to speak) at  the angles. The second has Corinthian columns, which must be fifteen  feet in height, and a plain entablature, and some more urn-shaped  pedestals. The third is completed with a miniature dome, and has upper  and lower lights in each face. Standing immediately underneath, or by  Nelson's tomb in the Crypt, these lights produce a striking and almost  unique effect. The present gilt ball and cross, which crown the  edifice, replaced the originals of Francis Bird, being put up by  Cockerell--the then Clerk to the Works--in 1821. The extreme height is  from 363 to 365 feet, and in 1848 the Ordnance Survey placed a \"crow's  nest\" against the cross for the purpose of observations from the  highest attainable point.    Miss Lucy Phillimore has published a paper of Wren's in which the  Surveyor remarks that for the architect it is necessary \"_in a  conspicuous Work to preserve His Undertaking from general censure, and  so for him to accommodate his Designs to the Geist of the Age he lives  in, though it appear to him less rational_.\" As regards the height of  the dome, we are the gainers because he was compelled to do this. It  is not, indeed, the whole of St. Paul's or its only important feature;  for St. Paul's is not a Byzantine church in which the dome is  practically not a part, but the whole. It is the most magnificent  member of a magnificent building, and with its graceful equipoise and  conscious evidence of stability stands alone and in a class by itself  amongst the cathedral superstructures of the land.      FOOTNOTES:    [69] Fergusson's \"History on the Modern Styles of Architecture,\" p.  243. The Pantheon at Rome as restored A.D. 202 was, or rather is, a  rotunda with a portico. The rotunda, according to Fergusson  (\"Handbook,\" p. 311), is about 125 feet in internal diameter, and an  external elevation of about 150 feet. The Basilica of Maxentius, or  Temple of Peace, may have been finished in the reign of Constantine  (Maxentius, A.D. 311-312; Constantine the Great, 325-337). The ruins  show an oblong of 265 feet by 195 feet in internal measurement,  including aisles. The whole length is divided into only three bays  (\"Handbook,\" p. 319). Fergusson should have added St. Peter's at Rome,  which exercised such an influence over Wren. This immense building  has, in the exterior, only one Order and an Attic. All three have the  round arch.    [70] Fergusson, \"Modern Architecture,\" p. 390.    [71] An _Attic_ is a small story above the cornice, or principal  elevation of a building. [The same would read better by substituting  \"story\" for \"elevation\".] An _Attic order_ is an inferior order of  architecture, used over the principal order of a building. It never  has columns, but, sometimes, small pilasters. (Longman, note, p. 164.)  Very common in Roman and Italian, but unknown in Greek.
