He was Norman-Irish, and a man of letters, and a crack shot, and all the  boys he knew were being killed.    \"What's silly?\" I asked, wondering what particular foolishness he was  thinking of, in a world of folly.    \"Silly to die with a broken bit of sandwich in one's mouth, just because  some German fellow, some fat, stupid man a few miles away, looses off a  bit of steel in search of the bodies of men with whom he has no personal  acquaintance.\"    \"Damn silly,\" I said.    \"That's all there is to it in modern warfare,\" said the lanky man. \"It's  not like the old way of fighting, body to body. Your strength against  your enemy's, your cunning against his. Now it is mechanics and  chemistry. What is the splendor of courage, the glory of youth, when  guns kill at fifteen miles?\"    Afterward this man went close to the enemy, devised tricks to make him  show his head, and shot each head that showed.    The guns ceased fire. Their tumult died down, and all was quiet again.  It was horribly quiet on our way into Ypres, across the railway, past  the red-brick asylum, where a calvary hung unscathed on broken walls,  past the gas-tank at the crossroads. This silence was not reassuring, as  our heels clicked over bits of broken brick on our way into Ypres. The  enemy had been shelling heavily for three-quarters of an hour in the  morning. There was no reason why he should not begin again... I  remember now the intense silence of the Grande Place that day after  the gas-attack, when we three men stood there looking up at the charred  ruins of the Cloth Hall. It was a great solitude of ruin. No living  figure stirred among the piles of masonry which were tombstones above  many dead. We three were like travelers who had come to some capital  of an old and buried civilization, staring with awe and uncanny fear at  this burial-place of ancient splendor, with broken traces of peoples who  once had lived here in security. I looked up at the blue sky above those  white ruins, and had an idea that death hovered there like a hawk ready  to pounce. Even as one of us (not I) spoke the thought, the signal came.  It was a humming drone high up in the sky.    \"Look out!\" said the lanky man. \"Germans!\"    It was certain that two birds hovering over the Grande Place were  hostile things, because suddenly white puffballs burst all round them,  as the shrapnel of our own guns scattered about them. But they flew  round steadily in a half-circle until they were poised above our heads.    It was time to seek cover, which was not easy to find just there, where  masses of stonework were piled high. At any moment things might drop. I  ducked my head behind a curtain of bricks as I heard a shrill \"coo-ee!\"  from a shell. It burst close with a scatter, and a tin cup was flung  against a bit of wall close to where the lanky man sat in a shell-hole.  He picked it up and said, \"Queer!\" and then smelled it, and said  \"Queer!\" again. It was not an ordinary bomb. It had held some poisonous  liquid from a German chemist's shop. Other bombs were dropping round  as the two hostile airmen circled overhead, untouched still by the  following shell-bursts. Then they passed toward their own lines, and my  friend in the shell-hole called to me and said, \"Let's be going.\"    It was time to go.    When we reached the edge of the town our guns away back started  shelling, and we knew the Germans would answer. So we sat in a field  nearby to watch the bombardment. The air moved with the rushing waves  which tracked the carry of each shell from our batteries, and over Ypres  came the high singsong of the enemies' answering voice.    As the dusk fell there was a movement out from Vlamertinghe, a movement  of transport wagons and marching men. They were going up in the darkness  through Ypres--rations and reliefs. They were the New Army men of the  West Riding.    \"Carry on there,\" said a young officer at the head of his company.  Something in his eyes startled me. Was it fear, or an act of sacrifice?  I wondered if he would be killed that night. Men were killed most nights  on the way through Ypres, sometimes a few and sometimes many. One shell  killed thirty one night, and their bodies lay strewn, headless and  limbless, at the corner of the Grande Place. Transport wagons galloped  their way through, between bursts of shell-fire, hoping to dodge them,  and sometimes not dodging them. I saw the litter of their wheels and  shafts, and the bodies of the drivers, and the raw flesh of the dead  horses that had not dodged them. Many men were buried alive in Ypres,  under masses of masonry when they had been sleeping in cellars, and were  wakened by the avalanche above them. Comrades tried to dig them out,  to pull away great stones, to get down to those vaults below from which  voices were calling; and while they worked other shells came and laid  dead bodies above the stones which had entombed their living comrades.  That happened, not once or twice, but many times in Ypres.    There was a Town Major of Ypres. Men said it was a sentence of death  to any officer appointed to that job. I think one of them I met had had  eleven predecessors. He sat in a cellar of the old prison, with walls of  sandbags on each side of him, but he could not sit there very long at  a stretch, because it was his duty to regulate the traffic according to  the shell-fire. He kept a visitors' book as a hobby, until it was buried  under piles of prison, and was a hearty, cheerful soul, in spite of the  menace of death always about him.          VIII      My memory goes back to a strange night in Ypres in those early days. It  was Gullett, the Australian eyewitness, afterward in Palestine, who had  the idea.    \"It would be a great adventure,\" he said, as we stood listening to the  gun-fire over there.    \"It would be damn silly,\" said a staff officer. \"Only a stern sense of  duty would make me do it.\"    It was Gullett who was the brave man.    We took a bottle of Cointreau and a sweet cake as a gift to any  battalion mess we might find in the ramparts, and were sorry for  ourselves when we failed to find it, nor, for a long time, any living  soul.    Our own footsteps were the noisiest sounds as we stumbled over the  broken stones. No other footstep paced down any of those streets of  shattered houses through which we wandered with tightened nerves. There  was no movement among all those rubbish heaps of fallen masonry and  twisted iron. We were in the loneliness of a sepulcher which had been  once a fair city.    For a little while my friend and I stood in the Grande Place, not  speaking. In the deepening twilight, beneath the last flame-feathers of  the sinking sun and the first stars that glimmered in a pale sky, the  frightful beauty of the ruins put a spell upon us.    The tower of the cathedral rose high above the framework of broken  arches and single pillars, like a white rock which had been split from  end to end by a thunderbolt. A recent shell had torn out a slice so that  the top of the tower was supported only upon broken buttresses, and the  great pile was hollowed out like a decayed tooth. The Cloth Hall was but  a skeleton in stone, with immense gaunt ribs about the dead carcass of  its former majesty. Beyond, the tower of St. Mark's was a stark ruin,  which gleamed white through the darkening twilight.    We felt as men who should stand gazing upon the ruins of Westminster  Abbey, while the shadows of night crept into their dark caverns and into  their yawning chasms of chaotic masonry, with a gleam of moon upon their  riven towers and fingers of pale light touching the ribs of isolated  arches. In the spaciousness of the Grande Place at Ypres my friend and I  stood like the last men on earth in a city of buried life.    It was almost dark now as we made our way through other streets of  rubbish heaps. Strangely enough, as I remember, many of the iron  lamp-posts had been left standing, though bent and twisted in a drunken  way, and here and there we caught the sweet whiff of flowers and plants  still growing in gardens which had not been utterly destroyed by the  daily tempest of shells, though the houses about them had been all  wrecked.    The woods below the ramparts were slashed and torn by these storms, and  in the darkness, lightened faintly by the crescent moon, we stumbled  over broken branches and innumerable shell-holes. The silence was broken  now by the roar of a gun, which sounded so loud that I jumped sideways  with the sudden shock of it. It seemed to be the signal for our  batteries, and shell after shell went rushing through the night, with  that long, menacing hiss which ends in a dull blast.    The reports of the guns and the explosions of the shells followed each  other, and mingled in an enormous tumult, echoed back by the ruins of  Ypres in hollow, reverberating thunder-strokes. The enemy was answering  back, not very fiercely yet, and from the center of the town, in or  about the Grande Place, came the noise of falling houses or of huge  blocks of stone splitting into fragments.    We groped along, scared with the sense of death around us. The first  flares of the night were being lighted by both sides above their  trenches on each side of the salient. The balls of light rose into the  velvety darkness and a moment later suffused the sky with a white glare  which faded away tremulously after half a minute.    Against the first vivid brightness of it the lines of trees along the  roads to Hooge were silhouetted as black as ink, and the fields between  Ypres and the trenches were flooded with a milky luminance. The whole  shape of the salient was revealed to us in those flashes. We could  see all those places for which our soldiers fought and died. We stared  across the fields beyond the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3327"],[0,"Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable (#18)"],[1,"e, your husband's shade,  instead of himself.  Your prayers, Halcyone, availed me nothing.  I am dead.  No more deceive yourself with vain hopes of my  return.  The stormy winds sunk my ship in the Aegean Sea; waves  filled my mouth while it called aloud on you.  No uncertain  messenger tells you this, no vague rumor brings it to your ears.  I come in person, a shipwrecked man, to tell you my fate.  Arise!  Give me tears, give me lamentations, let me not go down to  Tartarus unwept.\"  To these words Morpheus added the voice which  seemed to be that of her husband; he seemed to pour forth genuine  tears; his hands had the gestures of Ceyx.    Halcyone, weeping, groaned, and stretched out her arms in her  sleep, striving to embrace his body, but grasping only the air.  \"Stay!\" she cried; \"whither do you fly?  Let us go together.\"  Her own voice awakened her.  Starting up, she gazed eagerly  around, to see if he was still present, for the servants, alarmed  by her cries, had brought a light.  When she found him not, she  smote her breast and rent her garments.  She cares not to unbind  her hair, but tears it wildly.  Her nurse asks what is the cause  of her grief.  \"Halcyone is no more,\" she answers; \"she perished  with her Ceyx.  Utter not words of comfort, he is shipwrecked and  dead.  I have seen him.  I have recognized him.  I stretched out  my hands to seize him and detain him.  His shade vanished, but it  was the true shade of my husband.  Not with the accustomed  features, not with the beauty that was his, but pale, naked, and  with his hair wet with sea-water, he appeared to wretched me.  Here, in this very spot, the sad vision stood,\"   and she looked  to find the mark of his footsteps.  \"This it was, this that my  presaging mind foreboded, when I implored him not to leave me to  trust himself to the waves.  O, how I wish, since thou wouldst  go, that thou hadst taken me with thee!  It would have been far  better.  Then I should have had no remnant of life to spend  without thee, nor a separate death to die.  If I could bear to  live and struggle to endure, I should be more cruel to myself  than the sea has been to me.  But I will not struggle.  I will  not be separated from thee, unhappy husband.  This time, at least  I will keep thee company.  In death, if one tomb may not include  us, one epitaph shall; if I may not lay my ashes with thine, my  name, at least, shall not be separated.\"  Her grief forbade more  words, and these were broken with tears and sobs.    It was now morning.  She went to the sea-shore, and sought the  spot where she last saw him, on his departure.  \"Here he lingered  and cast off his tacklings and gave me his last kiss.\"  While she  reviews every moment, and strives to recall every incident,  looking out over the sea, she descries an indistinct object  floating in the water.  At first she was in doubt what it was,  but by degrees the waves bore it nearer, and it was plainly the  body of a man.  Though unknowing of whom, yet, as it was of some  shipwrecked one, she was deeply moved, and gave it her tears,  saying, \"Alas!  Unhappy one, and unhappy, if such there be, thy  wife!\"  Borne by the waves, it came nearer.  As she more and more  nearly views it, she trembles more and more.  Now, now it  approaches the shore.  Now marks that she recognizes appear.  It  is her husband!  Stretching out her trembling hands towards it,  she exclaims, \"O, dearest husband, is it thus you return to me?\"    There was built out from the shore a mole, constructed to break  the assaults of the sea, and stem its violent ingress.  She  leaped upon this barrier and (it was wonderful she could do so)  she flew, and striking the air with wings produced on the  instant, skimmed along the surface of the water, an unhappy bird.  As she flew, her throat poured forth sounds full of grief, and  like the voice of one lamenting.  When she touched the mute and  bloodless body, she enfolded its beloved limbs with her new-  formed wings, and tried to give kisses with her horny beak.  Whether Ceyx felt it, or whether it was only the action of the  waves, those who looked on doubted, but the body seemed to raise  its head.  But indeed he did feel it, and by the pitying gods  both of them were changed into birds.  They mate and have their  young ones.  For seven placid days, in winter time, Halcyone  broods over her nest, which floats upon the sea.  Then the way is  safe to seamen.  Aeolus guards the winds, and keeps them from  disturbing the deep.  The sea is given up, for the time, to his  grandchildren.    The following lines from Byron's Bride of Abydos might seem  borrowed from the concluding part of this description, if it were  not stated that the author derived the suggestion from observing  the motion of a floating corpse.      \"As shaken on his restless pillow,    His head heaves with the heaving billow;    That hand, whose motion is not life,    Yet feebly seems to menace strife,    Flung by the tossing tide on high,.    Then levelled with the wave  \"    Milton, in his Hymn for the Nativity, thus alludes to the fable  of the Halcyon:      \"But peaceful was the night    Wherein the Prince of light    His reign of peace upon the earth began;    The winds with wonder whist,    Smoothly the waters kist,    Whispering new joys to the mild ocean    Who now hath quite forgot to rave    While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.\"    Keats, also, in Endymion, says:      \"O magic sleep!  O comfortable bird    That broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind    Till it is hushed and smooth.\"        Chapter VI    Vertumnus and Pomona.  Cupid and Psyche    The Hamadryads were Wood-nymphs.  Among them was Pomona, and no  one excelled her in love of the garden and the culture of fruit.  She cared not for forests and rivers, but loved the cultivated  country and trees that bear delicious apples.  Her right hand  bore for its weapon not a javelin, but a pruning knife.  Armed  with this, she worked at one time, to repress the too luxuriant  growths, and curtail the branches that straggled out of place; at  another, to split the twig and insert therein a graft, making the  branch adopt a nursling not its own.  She took care, too, that  her favorites should not suffer from drought, and led streams of  water by them that the thirsty roots might drink.  This  occupation was her pursuit, her passion; and she was free from  that which Venus inspires.  She was not without fear of the  country people, and kept her orchard locked, and allowed not men  to enter.  The Fauns and Satyrs would have given all they  possessed to win her, and so would old Sylvanus, who looks young  for his years, and Pan, who wears a garland of pine leaves around  his head.  But Vertumnus loved her best of all; yet he sped no  better than the rest.  Oh, how often, in the disguise of a  reaper, did he bring her corn in a basket, and looked the very  image of a reaper!  With a hay-band tied round him, one would  think he had just come from turning over the grass.  Sometimes he  would have an ox-goad in his hand, and you would have said he had  just unyoked his weary oxen.  Now he bore a pruning-hook, and  personated a vine-dresser; and again with a ladder on his  shoulder, he seemed as if he was going to gather apples.  Sometimes he trudged along as a discharged soldier, and again he  bore a fishing-rod as if going to fish.  In this way, he gained  admission to her, again and again, and fed his passion with the  sight of her.    One day he came in the guise of an old woman, her gray hair  surmounted with a cap, and a staff in her hand.  She entered the  garden and admired the fruit.  \"It does you credit, my dear,\" she  said, and kissed Pomona, not exactly with an old woman's kiss.  She sat down on a bank, and looked up at the branches laden with  fruit which hung over her.  Opposite was an elm entwined with a  vine loaded with swelling grapes.  She praised the tree and its  associated vine, equally.  \"But,\" said Vertumnus, \"if the tree  stood alone, and had no vine clinging to it, it would lie  prostrate on the ground.  Why will you not take a lesson from the  tree and the vine, and consent to unite yourself with some one?  I wish you would.  Helen herself had not more numerous suitors,  nor Penelope, the wife of shrewd Ulysses.  Even while you spurn  them, they court you  rural deities and others of every kind that  frequent these mountains.  But if you are prudent and want to  make a good alliance, and will let an old woman advise you,   who  loves you better than you have any idea of,   dismiss all the  rest and accept Vertumnus, on my recommendation.  I know him as  well as he knows himself.  He is not a wandering deity, but  belongs to these mountains.  Nor is he like too many of the  lovers nowadays, who love any one they happen to see; he loves  you, and you only.  Add to this, he is young and handsome, and  has the art of assuming any shape he pleases, and can make  himself just what you command him.  Moreover, he loves the same  things that you do, delights in gardening, and handles your  apples with admiration.  But NOW he cares nothing for fruits, nor  flowers, nor anything else, but only yourself.  Take pity on him,  and fancy him speaking now with my mouth.  Remember that the gods  punish cruelty, and that Venus hates a hard heart, and will visit  such offenses sooner or later.  To prove this, let me tell you a  story, which is well known in Cyprus to be a fact; and I hope it  will have the effect to make you more merciful.    \"Iphis was a young man of humble parentage, who saw and loved  Anaxarete, a noble lady of the ancient family of Teucer.  He  struggled long with his passion, but when he found he could not  subdue it, he came a suppliant to her mansion.  First he told his  passion to her nurse, and begged her as she loved her foster-  child to favor his suit.  And then he tried to win her domestics  to his side.  Sometimes he"]]]
