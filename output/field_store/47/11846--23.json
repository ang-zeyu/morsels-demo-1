Instead of having marks to show the proper  proportions of sand and stone, the car is sometimes divided into two  compartments, one for each material and each holding the proper  proportion of its material when level full. This arrangement makes  proper proportioning somewhat more certain, since the men charging the  car cannot over-run the marks. In case separate cars are used for each  material, they are simply filled level full or to mark, and dumped in  succession into the feeding hopper. Trestle and car plant construction  and costs are given in a preceding section.    ~Charging by Shoveling.~--Charging by shoveling directly into the mixer is  seldom practiced except in street work with continuous mixers or in  charging gravity mixers of the trough type. Shoveling is not an economic  method of handling materials where the work involves carrying in  shovels, and it is only in a few classes of concrete work or in  isolated, exceptional cases that charging with shovels does not involve  carrying. The amount of material that men will load with shovels is  given in Chapter III, and the reader who wishes a full discussion of the  subject is referred to Gillette and Hauer, \"Earth Excavation and  Embankments; Methods and Cost.\"    In charging continuous mixers with shovels the usual practice for mixers  without automatic feed devices is to work from a continuous stock pile  of sand, stone and cement spread in layers in the proper proportions.  The shoveling is done in such a manner that each shovelful contains a  mixture of cement, sand and stone, and so that the rate of delivery to  the mixer is as uniform as possible. In charging mixers having automatic  feed devices the sand and stone are simply shoveled into the sand and  stone hoppers, whence they are fed automatically to the mixer. In  charging gravity mixers by shoveling the method is essentially the same;  the cement, sand and stone properly proportioned are spread in layers on  the shoveling board at the head of the mixer and the mixture then  shoveled into the mixer. In both of these cases mixing is performed to a  certain extent by the shoveling, and in both the provision of the  combination stock pile from which the men work involves labor which  comes within the meaning of the term charging as we have used it here.  Examples of street work in which the mixers were charged by shoveling  are given in Chapter XIV.    ~Charging with Derricks.~--When the stock piles are located close to the  mixer and the plant is fixed or is not frequently moved derricks can be  used economically for charging, particularly if the mixer be elevated so  that inclines become expensive. The following mode of operation will be  found to work well: Set the derrick so that its boom \"covers\" the sand  and stone piles and the mixer, and provide it with three buckets so that  there will always be one bucket at the stone pile and another at the  sand pile while the third is being handled. The derrick swinging from  the mixer, where it has discharged a bucket, drops the empty bucket at  the stone pile and picks up the bucket standing there, which has  received its proper charge of stone, and swings it to the sand pile and  drops it to get its charge of sand. Here it picks up the bucket standing  at the sand pile and which has its charges of both stone and sand, and  swings it to the mixer. By this arrangement the work of the derrick and  of the men filling the buckets is practically continuous. The buckets  can be provided with marks on the inside to show the proper points to  which to fill the stone and the sand or a partition may be riveted in  making a compartment for sand and another for stone. A special  charging-bucket that is arranged with a wheel and detachable handles  which permit it to be handled like a wheelbarrow is shown by Fig. 18.  This bucket can be used to advantage where the stock piles are too far  from the mixer for the derrick to reach both, the bucket being loaded  and wheeled to within reach of the derrick.    [Illustration: Fig. 18.--Charging Bucket With Wheel and Detachable  Handle.]    ~TYPES OF MIXERS.~--There are two types of concrete mixing machines or  concrete mixers as they are more commonly called: (1) Batch mixers and  (2) continuous mixers. In mixers of the first type a charge of cement,  sand, aggregate and water is put into the machine which mixes and  discharges the batch before taking in another charge; charging, mixing  and discharging is done in batches. In continuous mixers the cement  sand, stone and water are charged into the machine in a continuous  stream and the mixed concrete is discharged in another continuous  stream. While all concrete mixers are either batch or continuous mixers,  it is common practice because of their distinctive character to separate  gravity mixers, whether batch or continuous, into a third type. In  gravity mixers the concrete materials are made to mingle by falling  through specially constructed troughs, or tubes, or hoppers. We shall  describe mixers in this chapter as (1) batch mixers, (2) continuous  mixers, and (3) gravity mixers. No attempt will be made, however, to  describe all or even all the leading mixers of each type; a  representative mixer or two of each type will be described, enough to  give an indication of the range of practice, and the reader referred to  manufacturers' literature for further information.    ~Batch Mixers.~--Batch mixers are made in two principal forms which may be  designated as tilting and non-tilting mixers. In the first form the  mixer drum is tilted as one would tilt a bucket of water to discharge  the batch. In non-tilting mixers the mixer drum remains in one position,  the batch being discharged by special mechanism which dips it out a  portion at a time. In both forms the charge is put into the mixer as a  unit and kept confined as a unit during the time of mixing, which may be  any period wished by the operator.    [Illustration: Fig. 19.--Chicago Improved Cube Concrete Mixer with  Elevating Charging Hopper.]    _Chicago Improved Cube Tilting Mixer._--Figure 19 shows the improved  cube mixer made by the Municipal Engineering & Contracting Co., Chicago,  Ill. The drum consists of a cubical box with rounded corners and edges.  This box has hollow gudgeons at two diagonally opposite corners and  these gudgeons are open as shown to provide for charging and  discharging. The box is rotated by gears meshing with a circumferential  rack midway between gudgeons and another set of gears operate to tilt  the mixer. The inside of the box is smooth, there being no deflectors,  as its shape is such as to fold the batch repeatedly and thus accomplish  the mixing.    [Illustration: Fig. 20.--Ransome Concrete Mixer.]    _Ransome Non-Tilting Mixer._--Figure 20 shows a representative  non-tilting mixer made by the Ransome Concrete Machinery Co., Dunellen,  N. J. It consists of a cylindrical drum riding on rollers and rotated by  a train of gears meshing with circumferential racks on the drum. The  drum has a circular opening at each end; a charging chute enters one  opening and a tilting discharge chute may be thrown into or out of the  opposite opening. The cylindrical shell of the drum is provided inside  with steel plate deflectors, which plow through and pick up and drop the  concrete mixture as the drum revolves. The shape and arrangement of the  deflectors are such that the batch is shifted back and forth axially  across the mixer. To discharge the batch the discharge chute is tilted  so that its end projects into the mixer, in which position the material  picked up by the deflectors drops back onto the chute and runs out. The  discharge chute being independent of the mixing drum it can be thrown  into and out of discharge position at will without stopping the rotation  of the drum, and so can discharge any part or all of the batch at once.  The top edge of the charging chute ranges from 30Â½ to 38 ins. in height  above the top of the frame, varying with the size of the mixer.    [Illustration: Fig. 21.--Smith Concrete Mixer.]    _Smith Tilting Mixer._--Figure 21 shows a tilting mixer, known as the  Smith mixer, made by the Contractors' Supply & Equipment Co., Chicago,  Ill. The drum consists of two truncated cones with their large ends  fastened together and their small ends open for receiving the charge and  discharge of the batch. The drum is operated by a train of gears meshing  into a rack at mid-length where the cones join. In addition there is  another set of gears which tilt the drum to make the concrete flow out  of the discharge end. The inside of the drum is provided with steel  plate deflectors, which plow through and pick and drop the concrete  mixture shifting it back and forth axially in the process.    ~Continuous Mixers.~--Continuous mixers are those in which the cement,  sand and stone are fed to the charging hopper in a continuous stream and  the mixed concrete is discharged in another continuous stream. They are  built in two principal forms. In one form the cement, sand and stone  properly proportioned are shoveled directly into the mixing drum. In the  other form these materials are dumped into separate charging hoppers and  are automatically fed into the mixing drum in any relative proportions  desired. One form of continuous mixer with automatic feed is described  in the succeeding paragraph and another form is described in Chapter  XIV. The continuous mixer without automatic feed consists simply of a  trough with a rotating paddle shaft and its driving mechanism. The  charging, the mixing and the discharging are done in what is virtually a  succession of very small batches.

They have never visited a woolen  mill.\"    \"We shall be delighted to show them about,\" answered Mr. Munger. \"I will  send some one with them.\"    Turning, the manager beckoned to a young man who was busy at a desk.    \"This gentleman,\" continued he, \"has been with us many years and will be  able to answer all your questions. Take these visitors through the  factory, Mac, show them everything, and bring them back here. Now if you  are ready, Mr. Clark, we will join Mr. Bailey.\"    Donald and Thornton moved away, following their guide into a building  just across the yard. Here wool was being sorted by staplers who were  expert in judging its quality. They worked at frames covered with wire  netting which allowed the dirt to sift through, and as they handled the  material and tossed it into the proper piles they picked out straws,  burrs, and other waste caught in it.    \"This sorting must be carefully done,\" explained the bookkeeper who was  showing them about, \"or the wool will not take the dye well. Much  depends on having the fleeces clear of waste. We also are very  particular about the sorting. The finest wool, as you know, comes from  the sides of the sheep; that clipped from the head and legs is coarse  and stiff. All this we separate before we send the fleeces on to be  scoured. In this next room you will see how the material is washed.\"    They passed on and next saw how steam was blown through the wool, not  only removing the dirt but softening the fibers. The fleeces were also  washed in many great bowls of soap and water.    \"Here again we must exercise great care that the water is clean and the  soap pure, or the wool will not dye perfectly. We use a kind of potash  soap which we are sure is of the best make. Another thing which renders  the scouring of wool difficult is that we must not curl or snarl it  while we are washing it.\"    \"I don't see how you can help it,\" Donald said.    \"We can if we take proper care,\" returned the bookkeeper.    \"And what is this other machine for?\" inquired Thornton, pointing to one  at the end of the room.    [Illustration: \"WHAT IS THIS OTHER MACHINE?\"]    \"That machine is picking the wool apart so that the air can get through  it and help it to dry. After it is picked up light and fluffy we pass  it through these heavy rollers, which are like wringers and which  squeeze out the remaining moisture. Yet during all these processes we  must always be careful not to snarl the wool. See, here is where it  comes out white and clean, ready to go to the dyeing room.\"    Donald regarded the snowy fleeces with wonder.    \"You would never dream it could be the same wool!\" he said. \"Isn't it  beautiful? It is not much the way it looks when it leaves the ranch, is  it, Thornton?\"    \"I should say not,\" agreed the Westerner emphatically. \"The sheep ought  to see how handsome their coats are.\"    \"So they should!\" answered the young bookkeeper. \"You have been on a  ranch then?\"    \"We have just come from one,\" Donald answered.    \"Have you, indeed! It is a free life--not much like being shut up inside  brick walls.\"    \"You have been West yourself, perhaps,\" ventured Thornton.    \"Yes, years ago--when I was a boy; but not recently.\"    \"Ah, you should see the sheep country now!\" Thornton went on. \"It is  much improved, I reckon, since you were there.\"    \"I imagine so,\" the young guide answered with a wistful smile. \"It is so  long since I have had a breath of real air that I have almost forgotten  how it would seem.\"    \"If you are wanting fresh air go out on the ranges and fill your lungs.  You will find plenty there,\" declared the ranchman.    \"That is just what they are trying to make me do,\" the young man  replied, \"I have not been very well this year and Mr. Munger thinks the  confinement in the mill is telling on me. He wants me to go West for a  vacation.\"    \"And should you like to?\" questioned Donald.    The man did not answer; instead he said:    \"Suppose we go on. We must not waste too much time here. In this next  room you will see how the dyeing is done. We use centrifugal machines,  and beside those we have these others to keep the wool spread and  turned. With all our care not to snarl or curl it, it will get matted  and must therefore be picked apart again. So we pass it through these  revolving drums which, you see, have sets of spikes on them; as the  spikes on the different drums turn they catch in the wool and pick it  all apart so it is again light and fluffy as it was before.\"    \"Doesn't so much washing and dyeing take out all the yolk, and make the  wool very dry?\" inquired Thornton.    The young man conducting them seemed pleased at the question.    \"Yes, it does! That is just the trouble. Therefore we are forced to set  about getting some oil back into it; otherwise it would be so harsh and  stiff that we could do nothing with it. So we put the thin layers of  wool into these machines and carry them along to a spraying apparatus  which sprays them evenly with oil. We use olive oil, but some other  manufacturers prefer lard oil or oleine.\"    \"How funny to have to put oil back into the wool after you have just  washed it out!\" Donald remarked.    \"It is funny, isn't it?\" nodded the bookkeeper. \"Now on this side of the  room they are blending the fleeces. Sometimes we blend different  qualities of wool to get a desired effect, or sometimes we blend the  wool with cotton or a different fiber. We take a thin layer of wool,  then put another layer of a different kind over it. We then pick it all  up together until we get a uniform mixture.\"    \"It is a surprise to me that the wool has to go through so much red tape  before it comes to spinning,\" Thornton said.    \"It is a long process,\" responded their guide. \"I remember when I first  saw it, it seemed endless. Now I think little of it.\"    \"We get used to everything in time, I suppose,\" Thornton answered; then  he added whimsically: \"Still, I don't think I should ever get used to  riding in an automobile.\"    A hearty laugh came from behind them, and turning they saw Mr. Clark and  Mr. Munger, the manager.    \"I came to hunt you up,\" said Mr. Clark. \"I have finished my interview  with Mr. Bailey, and it seemed to me that by this time you must have  finished spinning your next-winter's overcoat, Don.\"    \"But I haven't, father,\" retorted Donald, smiling into his father's  face. \"I have not even begun to make the cloth at all.\"    \"The yarn is not spun yet, sir,\" put in the young man who was with them.    \"You are a slow guide, Mac, I fear,\" Mr. Munger laughed, laying a kindly  hand on his bookkeeper's shoulder. \"That is the chief fault with you  Scotchmen--you are too thorough. Now let us hurry along. These gentlemen  must get back to Boston to-day, you know.\"    Mr. Munger bustled ahead, conducting his visitors across a bridge and  into the next mill.    Here was the carding room. Layers of wool entered the carding engine and  were combed by a multitude of wire teeth until all the fibers lay  parallel; the thin film of wool then passed into a cone-like opening and  came out later in a thick strand of untwisted fibers.    \"It is now ready to go to the drawing-frames,\" Mr. Munger explained.  \"You will notice how these drawing-frames pull the wool into shape for  twisting and spinning, drawing it out to uniform size and finally  winding it on bobbins. The machine is a complicated one to explain, but  you can watch and see what it does.\"    \"How wonderful it is that machinery can do all this work,\" Mr. Clark  observed thoughtfully.    \"Yes, it is,\" Mr. Munger agreed. \"Years ago every part of the process  was done by hand. Little by little, however, machines have been  perfected until now we have contrivances that seem almost human. Shall  we go now and see the yarn spun?\"    When they reached the spinning room with its clatter of shifting bobbins  Mr. Munger turned to Donald.    \"I wonder if you know,\" he said, \"that wool is worked into two different  kinds of yarn--worsted yarn and woolen yarn. The fibers for worsted yarn  are long and lie nearly parallel, and when woven result in a smooth  surface. Broadcloth is made from worsted yarn. Woolen yarn, on the  other hand, has its fibers lying in every direction and all these loose  ends, when woven, give a rough surface. Of course after the cloth is  milled it comes out smooth, but it is not as smooth and fine as a  worsted cloth.\"    \"I think I understand,\" Donald said. \"Are we to see the cloth woven  next?\"    \"Yes. You know we weave nothing but woolens; you must go to a worsted  mill to see the other kinds of cloth made. The processes, though, are  much alike.\"    Mr. Munger then hurried the party to the weaving mills, where amid an  uproar of thousands of moving wheels, bobbins, and shuttles the threads  of yarn traveled back and forth, back and forth, and came out of the  looms as cloth. The cloth was then steamed, pressed, and rolled or  folded.    \"And now, young man,\" announced Mr. Munger to Donald jestingly, \"you  have seen the whole process, and there is no reason why your father  should not give you some wool and let you make your own cloth for your  next suit of clothes.\"    Although Donald was very tired he tried to smile.    \"I think,\" he said, \"that I would rather grow the wool on the ranch than  make it into cloth here. It is far nicer out on the ranges.\"    \"That is what I am trying to tell my young assistant,\" agreed Mr.  Munger. \"He is getting fagged, aren't you, Mac? You see he was brought  up in the open country, and much as we think of him, we feel that he  should go back to the Western"]]]
