Then, while an assistant, with  his hands grasped tightly _behind_ the object, presses it upward and  forward with all his force, the operator must pass his hand into the  mouth until he can seize the obstruction and draw it outward. This mode  of procedure must not be abandoned with the first failure, as by  continued efforts we may get the obstacle farther toward the mouth. If  we fail with the hand, forceps may be introduced through the mouth and  the object seized when it is just beyond the reach of the fingers.  Should our efforts entirely fail, we must then endeavor to force the  obstruction downward by means of the probang. This instrument, which is  of such signal service in removing choke in cattle, is decidedly more  dangerous to use for the horse, and I can not pass this point without a  word of caution to those who have been known to introduce into the  horse's throat such objects as whipstalks, shovel handles, etc. These  are always dangerous, and more than one horse has been killed by such  barbarous treatment.    In cervical as well as in thoracic choke we must first of all endeavor  to soften or lubricate the obstruction by pouring oil or mucilaginous  drinks down the gullet. After this has been done endeavor to move the  object by gentle manipulations with the hands. If choked with oats or  chaff (and these are the objects that most frequently produce choke in  the horse), begin by gently squeezing the lower portion of the impacted  mass and endeavor to work it loose a little at a time. This is greatly  favored at times if we apply hot fomentations immediately about the  obstruction. Persist in these efforts for at least an hour before  deciding to resort to other and more dangerous modes of treatment. If  unsuccessful, however, the probang may be used. In the absence of the  regular instrument, a piece of inch hose 6 feet long or a piece of new  three-quarter-inch manila rope well wrapped at the end with cotton twine  and thoroughly greased with tallow should be used. The mouth is to be  kept open by a gag of wood or iron and the head slightly raised and  extended. The probang is then to be carefully guided by the hand into  the upper part of the gullet and gently forced downward until the  obstruction is reached. Pressure must then be gradual and firm. At first  too much force should not be used, or the esophagus will be ruptured.  Firm, gentle pressure should be kept up until the object is felt to  move, after which it should be followed rapidly to the stomach. If this  mode of treatment is unsuccessful, a veterinarian or a physician should  be called, who can remove the object by cutting down upon it. This  should scarcely be attempted by a novice, as a knowledge of the anatomy  of the parts is essential to avoid cutting the large artery, vein, and  nerve that are closely related to the esophagus in its cervical  portion.    Thoracic choke can be treated only by means of the introduction of oils  and mucilaginous drinks and the careful use of the probang.      STRICTURE OF THE ESOPHAGUS.    This is due to corrosive medicines, previous choking (accompanied with  lacerations, which, in healing, narrow the passage), or pressure on the  gullet by tumors. In the majority of cases of stricture, dilatation of  the gullet in front of the constricted portion soon occurs. This  dilatation is the result of the frequent accumulation of solid feed  above the constriction. Little can be done in either of these instances  except to give sloppy or liquid feed.      SACULAR DILATATION OF THE ESOPHAGUS.    This follows choking, and is due to stretching or rupture of the  muscular coat of the gullet, allowing the internal, or mucous, coat to  protrude through the lacerated muscular walls. Such a dilatation, or  pouch, may gradually enlarge from the frequent imprisonment of feed.  When liquids are taken, the solid materials are partially washed out of  the pouch.    The symptoms are as follows: The horse is able to swallow a few  mouthfuls without apparent difficulty; then he will stop feeding, paw,  contract the muscles of his neck, and eject a portion of the feed  through his nose or mouth, or it will gradually work down to the  stomach. As the dilatation thus empties itself the symptoms gradually  subside, only to reappear when he has again taken solid feed. Liquids  pass without any, or but little, inconvenience. Should this dilatation  exist in the cervical region, surgical interference may sometimes prove  effectual; if in the thoracic portion, nothing can be done, and the  patient rapidly passes from hand to hand by \"swapping,\" until, at no  distant date, the contents of the sac become too firm to be dislodged as  heretofore, and the animal succumbs.      DISEASES OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES.    As a rule it is most difficult to distinguish between diseases of the  stomach and of the intestines of the horse. The reason for this is that  the stomach is relatively small. It lies away from the abdominal wall,  and so pressure from without can not be brought to bear upon it to  reveal sensitiveness or pain. Nor does enlargement, or distention, of  the stomach produce visible alteration in the form of the abdomen of the  horse. Moreover, it is a rule to which there are few exceptions, that an  irritant or cause of disease of the stomach acts likewise upon the  intestines, so that it is customary to find them similarly deranged. For  these reasons it is logical to discuss together the diseases of the  stomach and intestines and to point out such localizations in one organ  or another as are of importance in recognizing and treating the diseases  of the digestive organs of the horse.    It should be understood that gastritis signifies an inflammation of the  stomach and enteritis an inflammation of the intestines. The two terms  may be used together to signify a disease of the stomach and intestines,  as gastro-enteritis.      COLIC.    The disease of the horse that is most frequently met with is what is  termed \"colic,\" and many are the remedies that are reputed to be \"sure  cures\" for this disease. Let us discover, then, what the word \"colic\"  means. This term is applied loosely to almost all diseases of the organs  of the abdomen that are accompanied with pain. If the horse evinces  abdominal pain, he probably will be considered as suffering with colic,  no matter whether the difficulty is a cramp of the bowel, an internal  hernia, overloading of the stomach, or a painful disease of the bladder  or liver. Since these conditions differ so much in their causation and  their nature, it is manifestly absurd to treat them alike and to expect  the same drugs or procedures to relieve them all. Therefore, it is  important that, so far as possible, the various diseased states that are  so roughly classed together as colic shall be separated and  individualized in order that appropriate treatments may be prescribed.  With this object in view, colics will be considered under the following  headings: (1) Engorgement colic, (2) obstruction colic, (3) flatulent or  tympanitic colic, (4) spasmodic colic. Worm colic is discussed under the  heading \"Gastrointestinal parasites,\" page 90.    The general symptoms of abdominal pain, and therefore of colic, are  restlessness, cessation of whatever the horse is about, lying down,  looking around toward the flank, kicking with the hind feet upward and  forward toward the belly, jerky switching of the tail, stretching as  though to urinate, frequent change of position, and groaning. In the  more intense forms the horse plunges about, throws himself, rolls,  assumes unnatural positions, as sitting on the haunches, and grunts  loudly. Usually the pain is not constant, and during the intermissions  the horse may eat and appear normal. During the period of pain sweat is  poured out freely. Sometimes the horse moves constantly in a circle. The  respirations are accelerated, and usually there is no fever.    ENGORGEMENT COLIC.--This form of colic consists in an overloading of the  stomach with feed. The horse may have been overfed or the feed may have  collected in the stomach through failure of this organ to digest it and  pass it backward into the intestines. Even a normal quantity of feed  that the horse is unaccustomed to may cause disease. Hence a sudden  change of feed may produce engorgement colic. Continued full rations  while the horse is resting for a day or two or working too soon after  feeding may serve as a cause. New oats, corn, or hay, damaged feed, or  that which is difficult of digestion, such as barley or beans, may  incite engorgement colic. This disease may result from having fed the  horse twice by error or from its having escaped and taken an  unrestricted meal from the grain bin. Ground feeds that pack together,  making a sort of dough, may cause engorgement colic if they are not  mixed with cut hay. Greedy eaters are predisposed to this disease.    _Symptoms._--The horse shows the general signs of abdominal pain, which  may be long continued or of short duration. Retching or vomiting  movements are made; these are shown by labored breathing, upturned upper  lip, contraction of the flank, active motion at the throat, and drawing  in of the nose toward the breast, causing high arching of the neck. The  horse may assume a sitting position like a dog. At times the pain is  very great and the horse makes the most violent movements, as though  mad. At other times there is profound mental depression, the horse  standing in a sleepy, or dazed, way, with the head down, the eyes  closed, and leaning his head against the manger or wall. There is,  during the struggles, profuse perspiration. Following retching, gas may  escape from the mouth, and this may be followed by a sour froth and some  stomach contents. The horse can not vomit except when the stomach is  violently stretched, and, if the accumulation of feed or gas is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23475"],[0,"The Works of Lord Byron.

Though varied with a transitory storm,      More beautiful in that variety!      How hideous upon earth! where Peace and Hope,      And Love and Revel, in an hour were trampled      By human passions to a human chaos,      Not yet resolved to separate elements--      'Tis warring still!

Come, look upon it,      The Chaldee's God, which, when I gaze upon,      I grow almost a convert to your Baal.        _Bal._ As now he reigns in heaven, so once on earth      He swayed.        _Myr._    He sways it now far more, then; never                     50      Had earthly monarch half the power and glory      Which centres in a single ray of his.        _Bal._ Surely he is a God!        _Myr._                      So we Greeks deem too;      And yet I sometimes think that gorgeous orb      Must rather be the abode of Gods than one      Of the immortal sovereigns. Now he breaks      Through all the clouds, and fills my eyes with light      That shuts the world out. I can look no more.        _Bal._ Hark! heard you not a sound?        _Myr._                            No, 'twas mere fancy;      They battle it beyond the wall, and not                             60      As in late midnight conflict in the very      Chambers: the palace has become a fortress      Since that insidious hour; and here, within      The very centre, girded by vast courts      And regal halls of pyramid proportions,      Which must be carried one by one before      They penetrate to where they then arrived,      We are as much shut in even from the sound      Of peril as from glory.        _Bal._                  But they reached      Thus far before.        _Myr._           Yes, by surprise, and were                         70      Beat back by valour: now at once we have      Courage and vigilance to guard us.        _Bal._                              May they      Prosper!        _Myr._    That is the prayer of many, and      The dread of more: it is an anxious hour;      I strive to keep it from my thoughts. Alas!      How vainly!        _Bal._      It is said the King's demeanour      In the late action scarcely more appalled      The rebels than astonished his true subjects.        _Myr._ 'Tis easy to astonish or appal      The vulgar mass which moulds a horde of slaves;                     80      But he did bravely.        _Bal._              Slew he not Beleses?      I heard the soldiers say he struck him down.        _Myr._ The wretch was overthrown, but rescued to      Triumph, perhaps, o'er one who vanquished him      In fight, as he had spared him in his peril;      And by that heedless pity risked a crown.        _Bal._                                    Hark!        _Myr._ You are right; some steps approach, but slowly.              _Enter Soldiers, bearing in_ SALEMENES _wounded, with           a broken javelin in his side: they seat him upon one of                  the couches which furnish the Apartment_.        _Myr._ Oh, Jove!        _Bal._            Then all is over.        _Sal._                              That is false.      Hew down the slave who says so, if a soldier.        _Myr._ Spare him--he's none: a mere court butterfly,                90      That flutter in the pageant of a monarch.        _Sal._ Let him live on, then.        _Myr._                       So wilt thou, I trust.        _Sal._ I fain would live this hour out, and the event,      But doubt it. Wherefore did ye bear me here?        _Sol._ By the King's order.
