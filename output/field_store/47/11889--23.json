Here there  are two Christian missions, at Yarkand and Kashgar, under the protection  (as elsewhere in China) of the Chinese Government. Moslem propaganda is  spread by traders and others working from centres of Islamic learning  outside Chinese territory, such as Bokhara and Samarkand in Russian  Turkestan, and Cabul, the Afghan capital. In addition, there is a wave  of Chinese secular culture lapping in from the East, and missionaries  ask that existing missions be reinforced with funds to take a more  effective part in this battle for souls (as they express it). They  complain bitterly that the upper classes _will_ send their sons away to  places like Bokhara to be educated, and that they come back Moslems.  They also call for ample funds to attack Islam on its own ground in  Russian Turkestan, as it is permeating Christian Russia. This missionary  point of view is natural enough; how far it is justifiable is for the  contributing public to decide. To the ordinary mind Christian villages  which can become Moslem by the leavening influence of a few inhabitants  who have been to work in Moslem centres convey one of two impressions,  or both: either Christianity is not adapted to their requirements so  much as Islam, or they are too weak-kneed to be a credit to any faith,  and the one with the most virile methods may take them and make men of  them if it can. Moslem and missionary activities in Chinese Asia remind  one of cheese-mites gnawing away on opposite sides of a Double  Gloucester. They are very active, and if they keep at it may get through  some day; but meanwhile the cheese seems much the same as ever, apart  from its own internal changes which the mites cannot control or affect.    We will now turn to Africa, the main theatre of war between Moslem and  missionary, who battle with each other for pagan souls and each other's  proselytes.    We will first visit Morocco, the most westerly of Moslem countries.  Here there is not much missionary activity, either Protestant or  Catholic, but the French have been doing some excellent secular work  there, and under their tutelage the country is developing on lines of  moderate progress.    There is little antipathy shown to missionaries here, at any rate on the  coast, and medical missionaries have been welcomed inland. Education  does not flourish, but the country might be described by an unbiassed  observer as enlightened at least as far south as a line joining Mogador  and Morocco City (Marrakesh). In this northern area you will find an  industrious agricultural population of small farmers scattered about the  countryside, which consists of wide, open tracts of arable land under  millet, maize, and other cereals, dotted here and there with groves of  olive and orange and interspersed with large forests of _argan_ and  other small trees. Desert country encroaches more and more toward the  south, and in spite of several large streams draining into the Atlantic  from the snowcapped Atlas range, the country becomes very wild and  sterile the farther south you go from Mogador until it merges in the  Sahara, across which lies the great, bone-whitened highway that leads to  Timbuctoo.    Whatever the indigenous Berber of the Atlas may be, the northern Moor  has never been a mere barbarian, and Spain owes much to his culture and  industry. He certainly used to have a bizarre conception of  international amenities, and got himself very much disliked in the  Mediterranean and even northern waters in consequence. That phase,  however, has long since passed; the last corsair has rotted at its  moorings in Sallee harbour, and I am told that to put a wealthy Jew in a  thing like a giant trouser-press and extort money under pressure is  considered now an anachronism.    When I first knew the country, a quarter of a century ago, it was just  emerging from a revolutionary war, and local relations with foreigners  or even neighbours were capricious. They murdered a German bagman up the  coast in an _argan_ forest, and the \"Gefion\" landed a flag-flaunting  armed party to impress Mogador, which dropped water-pitchers on them  from upper windows and wondered what on earth the fuss was about.    On the other hand, I was well received by one of the revolted tribes,  which had chased its lawful Kaid into Mogador until checked by old  scrap-iron and bits of bottle-glass from the ancient cannon mounted over  the northern gate of the town.    I was treated with far more hospitality than my absurd and rather rash  enterprise deserved. Imagine a callow youth just out of his teens  dropping in haphazard on a rebel tribe accompanied by a mission-taught  Moor and a large liver-coloured pointer who had far more sense than his  master. My tame Moor was an excellent fellow, who, beside keeping my  tent tidy and cooking, helped me to grapple with the derived forms of  the Arabic verb and the subtleties of Moorish etiquette. I learnt to  drink green tea, syrup-sweet and flavoured with mint, out of ornate  little tumblers of a size and shape usually associated with champagne,  and, after assiduous practice, I could tackle a dish of boiled millet,  meat, and olives with the fingers of my right hand without mishap.    Beyond occasional brushes with adjacent sections of the neighbouring  tribe which had declared for the Fez central Government, I had very  little trouble, except that a peaceful boar-hunt would occasionally  degenerate into an intertribal skirmish if I and my party got too near  the loyalist border. As all concerned had, thanks to Western enterprise,  discarded their picturesque flint-locks in favour of Winchester or  Marlin repeaters, the proceedings required wary handling if we were to  extricate ourselves successfully, but my long-range sporting Martini  usually gave me the weather-gauge.    I dressed as a Moor, and looked the part, but made no attempt to pass  for anything but a Christian, nor did any unpopularity attach thereto; I  was merely expected--as a natural corollary--to have a little medical  knowledge (and it _was_ a little).    I found the attitude of Moors generally towards Christians curiously  inconsistent. In the towns there was a certain amount of formal  fanaticism which found vent in donkey-drivers addressing their beasts as  \"_Nasara_\" to the accompaniment of whacks and yells, but public  behaviour was tolerant enough, and the attitude of Moorish officialdom  was almost courtly.    Jews had rather a bad time, if local subjects, as their black slippers  and furtive bearing outside their own quarter made them a mark for  naughty little boys, who flung their canary-coloured slippers at them  with curses and imprecations deserving a more direct and personal  application of their footgear. Most of the wealthier Jews had acquired  European or American protection, and were safe enough. They lived in the  Frankish quarter and dressed in ultra-European style. They made rather a  depressing spectacle on Saturdays, when, garbed in black broadcloth,  with bowler hats, they drifted through the sunlit streets on their  Sabbath constitutional from one town gate to the next and back. They  were keen trade competitors, and gained or lost fortunes by gambling in  the almond export-market or catching a grain-famine at the psychological  moment. One of them had retired to a leisured affluence on the proceeds  that a big cargo of almonds had yielded him at a startling turn in the  market. He was a hospitable soul who met me once entering the landward  gate in a travel-stained burnoose and insisted on dragging me into his  gorgeously-carpeted house to drink _aquardiente_ and look at his  \"curios.\" These consisted chiefly of modern firearms, some of  first-class London make, which hung on his walls as ornaments, having  been bought haphazard without ammunition or sporting intent. I nearly  had a fit when he showed me a double .577 Express hopelessly rusted by  the damp sea-air and offered to lend it me if I could find \"shots\" for  it. The reverse of the shield was illustrated by another acquaintance of  mine who had made a large fortune by importing Russian wheat to Morocco  in famine time and had lost it in a short but striking career in  England, during which he was said to have entertained Royalty,  astonished the racing world and married a well-known actress in light  comedy. He, too, was of hospitable intent, but had generally left his  purse at home when the reckoning came. On the other hand, he always  carried the \"stub\" of the cheque-book which had seen him to the apogee  of his meteoric career, and a glance at its counterfoils (by his express  invitation) was well worth the price of a drink or two.    The local Islamic attitude toward Moorish Jews was one of contemptuous  tolerance. They could certainly travel, in native dress, where no  Christian could. Once, in the _patio_ or go-down of a European merchant,  I met a greasy, unkempt Jew in a tattered gaberdine watching my  commercial friend as he weighed what I took to be a double handful of  crude brass curtain rings such as traders used to sell by the gross  along the West African coast. They were solid gold and represented the  venture of a Jewish syndicate which had collected it in pinches of  gold-dust from the river beds of southern Soos and hit on this form of  transport. A troop of horse could never have brought it, as gold, a  day's journey through the lawless tribes of the south, but that  tatterdemalion Jew had done it at the price of a few contemptuous  buffets. He had, indeed, offered one truculent gang of highwaymen a few  of the tawdry-looking rings to let him pass, but they had waved such  obvious trash aside in their eager search for actual cash, which they  had taken to the last"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/271"],[0,"Black Beauty (#18)"],[1,"set off at full speed from the very stable-yard; and  when they want to stop, they first whip us, and then pull up so suddenly  that we are nearly thrown on our haunches, and our mouths jagged with  the bit--they call that pulling up with a dash; and when they turn a  corner they do it as sharply as if there were no right side or wrong  side of the road.    I well remember one spring evening I and Rory had been out for the day.  (Rory was the horse that mostly went with me when a pair was ordered,  and a good honest fellow he was.) We had our own driver, and as he was  always considerate and gentle with us, we had a very pleasant day. We  were coming home at a good smart pace, about twilight. Our road turned  sharp to the left; but as we were close to the hedge on our own side,  and there was plenty of room to pass, our driver did not pull us in. As  we neared the corner I heard a horse and two wheels coming rapidly down  the hill toward us. The hedge was high, and I could see nothing, but the  next moment we were upon each other. Happily for me, I was on the side  next the hedge. Rory was on the left side of the pole, and had not even  a shaft to protect him. The man who was driving was making straight for  the corner, and when he came in sight of us he had no time to pull over  to his own side. The whole shock came upon Rory. The gig shaft ran right  into the chest, making him stagger back with a cry that I shall never  forget. The other horse was thrown upon his haunches and one shaft  broken. It turned out that it was a horse from our own stables, with the  high-wheeled gig that the young men were so fond of.    The driver was one of those random, ignorant fellows, who don't even  know which is their own side of the road, or, if they know, don't care.  And there was poor Rory with his flesh torn open and bleeding, and the  blood streaming down. They said if it had been a little more to one side  it would have killed him; and a good thing for him, poor fellow, if it  had.    As it was, it was a long time before the wound healed, and then he was  sold for coal-carting; and what that is, up and down those steep hills,  only horses know. Some of the sights I saw there, where a horse had to  come downhill with a heavily loaded two-wheel cart behind him, on which  no brake could be placed, make me sad even now to think of.    After Rory was disabled I often went in the carriage with a mare named  Peggy, who stood in the next stall to mine. She was a strong, well-made  animal, of a bright dun color, beautifully dappled, and with a  dark-brown mane and tail. There was no high breeding about her, but she  was very pretty and remarkably sweet-tempered and willing. Still, there  was an anxious look about her eye, by which I knew that she had some  trouble. The first time we went out together I thought she had a very  odd pace; she seemed to go partly a trot, partly a canter, three or four  paces, and then a little jump forward.    It was very unpleasant for any horse who pulled with her, and made me  quite fidgety. When we got home I asked her what made her go in that  odd, awkward way.    \"Ah,\" she said in a troubled manner, \"I know my paces are very bad, but  what can I do? It really is not my fault; it is just because my legs are  so short. I stand nearly as high as you, but your legs are a good three  inches longer above your knee than mine, and of course you can take a  much longer step and go much faster. You see I did not make myself.  I wish I could have done so; I would have had long legs then. All my  troubles come from my short legs,\" said Peggy, in a desponding tone.    \"But how is it,\" I said, \"when you are so strong and good-tempered and  willing?\"    \"Why, you see,\" said she, \"men will go so fast, and if one can't keep up  to other horses it is nothing but whip, whip, whip, all the time. And so  I have had to keep up as I could, and have got into this ugly shuffling  pace. It was not always so; when I lived with my first master I always  went a good regular trot, but then he was not in such a hurry. He was a  young clergyman in the country, and a good, kind master he was. He had  two churches a good way apart, and a great deal of work, but he never  scolded or whipped me for not going faster. He was very fond of me.  I only wish I was with him now; but he had to leave and go to a large  town, and then I was sold to a farmer.    \"Some farmers, you know, are capital masters; but I think this one was a  low sort of man. He cared nothing about good horses or good driving; he  only cared for going fast. I went as fast as I could, but that would  not do, and he was always whipping; so I got into this way of making a  spring forward to keep up. On market nights he used to stay very late at  the inn, and then drive home at a gallop.    \"One dark night he was galloping home as usual, when all of a sudden the  wheel came against some great heavy thing in the road, and turned the  gig over in a minute. He was thrown out and his arm broken, and some of  his ribs, I think. At any rate, it was the end of my living with him,  and I was not sorry. But you see it will be the same everywhere for me,  if men must go so fast. I wish my legs were longer!\"    Poor Peggy! I was very sorry for her, and I could not comfort her, for  I knew how hard it was upon slow-paced horses to be put with fast ones;  all the whipping comes to their share, and they can't help it.    She was often used in the phaeton, and was very much liked by some of  the ladies, because she was so gentle; and some time after this she was  sold to two ladies who drove themselves, and wanted a safe, good horse.    I met her several times out in the country, going a good steady pace,  and looking as gay and contented as a horse could be. I was very glad to  see her, for she deserved a good place.    After she left us another horse came in her stead. He was young, and had  a bad name for shying and starting, by which he had lost a good place. I  asked him what made him shy.    \"Well, I hardly know,\" he said. \"I was timid when I was young, and was a  good deal frightened several times, and if I saw anything strange I  used to turn and look at it--you see, with our blinkers one can't see  or understand what a thing is unless one looks round--and then my master  always gave me a whipping, which of course made me start on, and did not  make me less afraid. I think if he would have let me just look at things  quietly, and see that there was nothing to hurt me, it would have been  all right, and I should have got used to them. One day an old gentleman  was riding with him, and a large piece of white paper or rag blew across  just on one side of me. I shied and started forward. My master as usual  whipped me smartly, but the old man cried out, 'You're wrong! you're  wrong! You should never whip a horse for shying; he shies because he is  frightened, and you only frighten him more and make the habit worse.'  So I suppose all men don't do so. I am sure I don't want to shy for the  sake of it; but how should one know what is dangerous and what is not,  if one is never allowed to get used to anything? I am never afraid of  what I know. Now I was brought up in a park where there were deer; of  course I knew them as well as I did a sheep or a cow, but they are not  common, and I know many sensible horses who are frightened at them, and  who kick up quite a shindy before they will pass a paddock where there  are deer.\"    I knew what my companion said was true, and I wished that every young  horse had as good masters as Farmer Grey and Squire Gordon.    Of course we sometimes came in for good driving here. I remember one  morning I was put into the light gig, and taken to a house in Pulteney  Street. Two gentlemen came out; the taller of them came round to my  head; he looked at the bit and bridle, and just shifted the collar with  his hand, to see if it fitted comfortably.    \"Do you consider this horse wants a curb?\" he said to the hostler.    \"Well,\" said the man, \"I should say he would go just as well without;  he has an uncommon good mouth, and though he has a fine spirit he has no  vice; but we generally find people like the curb.\"    \"I don't like it,\" said the gentleman; \"be so good as to take it off,  and put the rein in at the cheek. An easy mouth is a great thing on a  long journey, is it not, old fellow?\" he said, patting my neck.    Then he took the reins, and they both got up. I can remember now how  quietly he turned me round, and then with a light feel of the rein, and  drawing the whip gently across my back, we were off.    I arched my neck and set off at my best pace. I found I had some one  behind me who knew how a good horse ought to be driven. It seemed like  old times again, and made me feel quite gay.    This gentleman took a great liking to me, and after trying me several  times with the saddle he prevailed upon my master to sell me to a friend  of his, who wanted a safe, pleasant horse for riding. And so it came to  pass that in the summer I was sold to Mr. Barry.          30 A Thief      My new master was an unmarried man. He lived at Bath, and was much  engaged in business. His doctor advised him to take horse exercise, and  for this purpose he bought me. He hired a stable a short distance from  his lodgings, and engaged a man named Filcher as groom. My master knew  very little about horses, but he treated me well, and I should have had  a good and easy place but for circumstances of which he was ignorant. He  ordered the best hay with plenty of oats, crushed beans, and bran,  with vetches, or rye grass, as the man might think needful. I heard the  master give the order, so I knew there was plenty of good food, and I  thought I was well off.    For a few days all went on well. I found that my groom understood  his business. He kept the stable clean and airy, and he groomed me  thoroughly; and was never otherwise than gentle. He had been an"]]]
