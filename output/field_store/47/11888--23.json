Now I fear that this will not hold good with respect to  our ages, and that, as long as I live, I shall never cease to keep my  advantage over you.    EMILY.    I think that I have found a comparison for specific heat, which is very  applicable. Suppose that two men of equal weight and bulk, but who  required different quantities of food to satisfy their appetites, sit  down to dinner, both equally hungry; the one would consume a much  greater quantity of provisions than the other, in order to be equally  satisfied.    MRS. B.    Yes, that is very fair; for the quantity of food necessary to satisfy  their respective appetites, varies in the same manner as the quantity of  caloric requisite to raise equally the temperature of different bodies.    EMILY.    The thermometer, then, affords no indication of the specific heat of  bodies?    MRS. B.    None at all: no more than satiety is a test of the quantity of food  eaten. The thermometer, as I have repeatedly said, can be affected only  by free caloric, which alone raises the temperature of bodies.    But there is another mode of proving the existence of specific heat,  which affords a very satisfactory illustration of that modification.  This, however, I did not enlarge upon before, as I thought it might  appear to you rather complicated. --If you mix two fluids of different  temperatures, let us say the one at 50 degrees, and the other at 100  degrees, of what temperature do you suppose the mixture will be?    CAROLINE.    It will be no doubt the medium between the two, that is to say, 75  degrees.    MRS. B.    That will be the case if the two bodies happen to have the same capacity  for caloric; but if not, a different result will be obtained. Thus, for  instance, if you mix together a pound of mercury, heated at 50 degrees,  and a pound of water heated at 100 degrees, the temperature of the  mixture, instead of being 75 degrees, will be 80 degrees; so that the  water will have lost only 12 degrees, whilst the mercury will have  gained 38 degrees; from which you will conclude that the capacity of  mercury for heat is less than that of water.    CAROLINE.    I wonder that mercury should have so little specific heat. Did we not  see it was a much better conductor of heat than water?    MRS. B.    And it is precisely on that account that its specific heat is less. For  since the conductive power of bodies depends, as we have observed  before, on their readiness to receive heat and part with it, it is  natural to expect that those bodies which are the worst conductors  should absorb the most caloric before they are disposed to part with it  to other bodies. But let us now proceed to LATENT HEAT.    CAROLINE.    And pray what kind of heat is that?    MRS. B.    It is another modification of combined caloric, which is so analogous to  specific heat, that most chemists make no distinction between them; but  Mr. Pictet, in his Essay on Fire, has so clearly discriminated them,  that I am induced to adopt his view of the subject. We therefore call  _latent heat_ that portion of insensible caloric which is employed in  changing the state of bodies; that is to say, in converting solids into  liquids, or liquids; into vapour. When a body changes its state from  solid to liquid, or from liquid to vapour, its expansion occasions a  sudden and considerable increase of capacity for heat, in consequence of  which it immediately absorbs a quantity of caloric, which becomes fixed  in the body which it has transformed; and, as it is perfectly concealed  from our senses, it has obtained the name of _latent_ heat.    CAROLINE.    I think it would be much more correct to call this modification latent  caloric instead of latent heat, since it does not excite the sensation  of heat.    MRS. B.    This modification of heat was discovered and named by Dr. Black long  before the French chemists introduced the term caloric, and we must not  presume to alter it, as it is still used by much better chemists than  ourselves. And, besides, you are not to suppose that the nature of heat  is altered by being variously modified: for if latent heat and specific  heat do not excite the same sensations as free caloric, it is owing to  their being in a state of confinement, which prevents them from acting  upon our organs; and consequently, as soon as they are extricated from  the body in which they are imprisoned, they return to their state of  free caloric.    EMILY.    But I do not yet clearly see in what respect latent heat differs from  specific heat; for they are both of them imprisoned and concealed in  bodies.    MRS. B.    Specific heat is that which is employed in filling the capacity of a  body for caloric, in the state in which this body actually exists; while  latent heat is that which is employed only in effecting a change of  state, that is, in converting bodies from a solid to a liquid, or from a  liquid to an aeriform state. But I think that, in a general point of  view, both these modifications might be comprehended under the name of  _heat of capacity_, as in both cases the caloric is equally engaged in  filling the capacities of bodies.    I shall now show you an experiment, which I hope will give you a clear  idea of what is understood by latent heat.    The snow which you see in this phial has been cooled by certain chemical  means (which I cannot well explain to you at present), to 5 or 6 degrees  below the freezing point, as you will find indicated by the thermometer  which is placed in it. We shall expose it to the heat of a lamp, and you  will see the thermometer gradually rise, till it reaches the freezing  point----    EMILY.    But there it stops, Mrs. B., and yet the lamp burns just as well as  before. Why is not its heat communicated to the thermometer?    CAROLINE.    And the snow begins to melt, therefore it must be rising above the  freezing point?    MRS. B.    The heat no longer affects the thermometer, because it is wholly  employed in converting the ice into water. As the ice melts, the caloric  becomes _latent_ in the new-formed liquid, and therefore cannot raise  its temperature; and the thermometer will consequently remain  stationary, till the whole of the ice be melted.    CAROLINE.    Now it is all melted, and the thermometer begins to rise again.    MRS. B.    Because the conversion of the ice into water being completed, the  caloric no longer becomes latent; and therefore the heat which the water  now receives raises its temperature, as you find the thermometer  indicates.    EMILY.    But I do not think that the thermometer rises so quickly in the water as  it did in the ice, previous to its beginning to melt, though the lamp  burns equally well?    MRS. B.    That is owing to the different specific heat of ice and water. The  capacity of water for caloric being greater than that of ice, more heat  is required to raise its temperature, and therefore the thermometer  rises slower in the water than in the ice.    EMILY.    True; you said that a solid body always increased its capacity for heat  by becoming fluid; and this is an instance of it.    MRS. B.    Yes, and the latent heat is that which is absorbed in consequence of the  greater capacity which the water has for heat, in comparison to ice.    I must now tell you a curious calculation founded on that consideration.  I have before observed to you that though the thermometer shows us the  comparative warmth of bodies, and enables us to determine the same point  at different times and places, it gives us no idea of the absolute  quantity of heat in any body. We cannot tell how low it ought to fall by  the privation of all heat, but an attempt has been made to infer it in  the following manner. It has been found by experiment, that the capacity  of water for heat, when compared with that of ice, is as 10 to 9, so  that, at the same temperature, ice contains one tenth of caloric less  than water. By experiment also it is observed, that in order to melt  ice, there must be added to it as much heat, as would, if it did not  melt it, raise its temperature 140 degrees. This quantity of heat is  therefore absorbed when the ice, by being converted into water, is made  to contain one-ninth more caloric than it did before. Therefore 140  degrees is a ninth part of the heat contained in ice at 30 degrees; and  the point of zero, or the absolute privation of heat, must consequently  be 1260 degrees below 32 degrees.    This mode of investigating so curious a question is ingenious, but its  correctness is not yet established by similar calculations for other  bodies. The points of absolute cold, indicated by this method in various  bodies, are very remote from each other; it is however possible, that  this may arise from some imperfection in the experiments.    CAROLINE.    It is indeed very ingenious--but we must now attend to our present  experiment. The water begins to boil, and the thermometer is again  stationary.    MRS. B.    Well, Caroline, it is your turn to explain the phenomenon.    CAROLINE.    It is wonderfully curious! The caloric is now busy in changing the water  into steam, in which it hides itself, and becomes insensible. This is  another example of latent heat, producing a change of form. At first it  converted a solid body into a liquid, and now it turns the liquid into  vapour!    MRS. B.    You see, my dear, how easily you have become acquainted with these  modifications of insensible heat, which at first appeared so  unintelligible. If, now, we were to reverse these changes, and condense  the vapour into water, and the water into ice, the latent heat would  re-appear entirely, in the form of free caloric.    EMILY.    Pray do let us see the effect of latent heat returning to its free  state.    MRS. B.    For the purpose of showing this, we need simply conduct the vapour  through this tube into this vessel of cold water, where it will part  with its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26978"],[0,"Salem Witchcraft and Cotton Mather: A Reply (#18)"],[1,"transpired, in the preliminary examinations at Salem, before  the arrival of Sir William, at Boston. In it, he spreads out, with  considerable fullness, what had been brought before the Magistrates,  consisting mainly of spectral testimony; and narrates the appearances  and doings of spectres assaulting the \"afflicted children,\" not as mere  matters alleged, but as facts. It is true that he appears as a narrator;  yet, in the manner and tenor of his statement, he cannot but be  considered as endorsing the spectral evidence. Speaking of the examining  Magistrates, and saying that it is \"now,\" that is, in 1697, \"generally  thought they went out of the way,\" he expresses himself as follows: \"The  afflicted people vehemently accused several persons, in several places,  that the _spectres_ which afflicted them, did exactly resemble _them_;  until the importunity of the accusations did provoke the Magistrates to  examine them. When many of the accused came upon their examination, it  was found, that the demons, then a thousand ways abusing of the poor  afflicted people, had with a marvellous exactness represented them; yea,  it was found that many of the accused, but casting their eye upon the  afflicted, the afflicted, though their faces were never so much another  way, would fall down and lie in a sort of a swoon, wherein they would  continue, whatever hands were laid upon them, until the hands of the  accused came to touch them, and then they would revive immediately: and  it was found, that various kinds of natural actions, done by many of the  accused in or to their own bodies, as leaning, bending, turning awry, or  squeezing their hands, or the like, were presently attended with the  like things preternaturally done upon the bodies of the afflicted,  though they were so far asunder, that the afflicted could not at all  observe the accused.\"--_Magnalia_, Book II., p. 61.    Indeed, throughout his account of the appearances and occurrences, at  the examinations before the committing Magistrates, it must be allowed  that he exposed a decided bias, in his own mind, to the belief and  reception of the spectral evidence. He commences that account in these  words: \"Some scores of people, first about Salem, the centre and  first-born of all the towns in the Colony, and afterwards in several  other places, were arrested with many preternatural vexations upon their  bodies, and a variety of cruel torments, which were evidently inflicted  from the demons of the invisible world. The people that were infected  and infested with such Demons, in a few days time, arrived at such a  refining alteration upon their eyes, that they could see their  tormentors; they saw a Devil of a little stature and of a tawny color,  attended still with spectres that appeared in more human  circumstances.\"--_Page 60._    And he concludes it as follows: \"Flashy people may burlesque these  things, but when hundreds of the most sober people in a country, where  they have as much mother-wit certainly as the rest of mankind, know them  to be _true_, nothing but the absurd and froward spirit of Sadduceeism  can question them. I have not yet mentioned so much as one thing, that  will not be justified, if it be required, by the oaths of more  considerate persons, than any that can ridicule these odd  phenomena.\"--_Page 61._    When he comes to the conclusion of the affair, and mentions the general  pardon of the convicted and accused, he says: \"there fell out several  strange things that caused the spirit of the country to run as  vehemently upon the acquitting of all the accused, as it had, by  mistake, ran at first upon the condemning of them.\" \"In fine, the last  Courts that sate upon this thorny business, finding that it was  impossible to penetrate into the whole meaning of the things that had  happened, and that so many unsearchable cheats were interwoven into the  conclusion of a mysterious business, which perhaps had not crept  thereinto at the beginning of it, they cleared the accused as fast as  they tried them.\" But, even then, Mather could not wholly disengage his  mind from the \"mistake.\" \"More than twice twenty,\" he says, in  connection with the fact that the confessions had been receded from,  \"had made such voluntary, and harmonious, and uncontrollable  confessions, that if they were all sham, there was therein the greatest  violation, made by the efficacy of the invisible world, upon the rules  of understanding human affairs, that was ever seen since God made man  upon the earth.\"    In this same work he presents, in condensed shape, the views of the  advocates and of the opponents of spectral testimony, without striking  the balance between them or avowedly taking sides with either, although  it may fairly be observed that the weight he puts into the scale of the  former is quite preponderating. From incidental expressions, too, it  might be inferred that he was to be classed with the former, as he  ascribes to them some \"philosophical schemes,\" in explanation of the  phenomena of witchcraft, that look like his notion of the \"Plastic  spirit of the world.\" Another incidental remark seems to point to  Increase Mather, as to be classed with the latter, as follows: \"Though  against some of them that were tried, there came in so much other  evidence of their diabolical compacts, that some of the most judicious,  and yet vehement, opposers of the notions then in vogue, publicly  declared, _Had they themselves been on the Bench, they could not have  acquitted them_; nevertheless, divers were condemned, against whom the  chief evidence was founded in the spectral exhibitions.\"    Increase Mather, in the Postscript to his _Cases of Conscience_, says:  \"I am glad that there is published to the World (by my Son) a _Breviate  of the Tryals_ of some who were lately executed, whereby I hope the  thinking part of Mankind will be satisfied, that there was more than  that which is called _Spectre Evidence_ for the Conviction of the  Persons condemned. I was not my self present at any of the Tryals,  excepting one, _viz._ that of _George Burroughs_; had I been one of his  Judges, I could not have acquitted him: For several Persons did upon  Oath testifie, that they saw him do such things as no Man that has not a  Devil to be his Familiar could perform.\"    It is observable that Increase Mather does not express or intimate, in  this passage, any objection to the introduction of spectral evidence.  When we come to consider Cotton Mather's _Breviate_ of the trial of  George Burroughs, we shall see how slight and inadequate was what  Increase Mather could have heard, _at the Trial_, to prove that  Burroughs had exhibited strength which the Devil only could have  supplied. The most trivial and impertinent matter was all that was  needed, to be added to spectral testimony, to give it fatal effect. The  value, by the way, of Increase Mather's averment, that \"more than that  which is called Spectre Evidence\" was adduced against the persons  convicted, is somewhat impaired by the admission of Cotton Mather, just  before quoted, that \"divers were condemned,\" against whom it was the  \"chief evidence.\"    In stating the objection, by some, to the admission of spectral  evidence, on the ground that the Devil might assume the shape of an  innocent person, and if that person was held answerable for the actions  of that spectral appearance, it would be in the power of the Devil to  convict and destroy any number of innocent and righteous people, and  thereby \"subvert Government and disband and ruin human society,\" Cotton  Mather gets over the difficulty thus: \"And yet God may sometimes suffer  such things to evene, that we may know, thereby, how much we are  beholden to him, for that restraint which he lays upon the infernal  spirits, who would else reduce a world into a chaos.\"    This is a striking instance of the way in which words may be made, not  only to cover, but to transform, ideas. A reverent form of language  conceals an irreverent conception. The thought is too shocking for plain  utterance; but, dressed in the garb of ingenious phraseology, it assumes  an aspect that enables it to pass as a devout acknowledgment of a divine  mystery. The real meaning, absurd as it is dreadful, to state or think,  is that the Heavenly Father sometimes may, not merely permit, but will,  the lies of the Devil to mislead tribunals of justice to the shedding of  the blood of the righteous, that he may, thereby show how we are  beholden to Him, that a like outrage and destruction does not happen to  us all. He allows the Devil, by false testimony, to bring about the  perpetration of the most horrible wrong. It is a part of the \"Rectoral  Righteousness of God,\" that it should be so. What if the Courts do admit  the testimony of the Devil in the appearance of a spectre, and, on its  strength, consign to death the innocent? It is the will of God, that it  should be so. Let that will be done.    But however the sentiment deserves to be characterized, it removes the  only ground upon which, in that day, spectral evidence was objected  to--namely, that it might endanger the innocent. If such was the will of  God, the objectors were silenced.    In concluding the examination of the question whether Cotton Mather  denounced, or countenanced, the admission of spectral testimony--for  that is the issue before us--I feel confident that it has been made  apparent, that it was not in reference to the _admission_ of such  testimony, that he objected to the \"principles that some of the Judges  had espoused,\" but to the method in which it should be _handled_ and  _managed_. I deny, utterly, that it can be shown that he opposed its  _admission_. In none of his public writings did he ever pretend to this.  The utmost upon which he ventured, driven to the defensive on this very  point, as he was during all the rest of his days, was to say that he was  opposed to its \"excessive use.\" Once,"]]]
