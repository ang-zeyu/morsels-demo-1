I was so deeply engaged within, as often to forget things without, yet  not anything which was of consequence. My husband was hasty, and  inattention frequently irritated him. I walked into the garden, without  observing anything. When my husband, who could not go thither, asked me  about it, I knew not what to say, at which he was angry. I went thither  on purpose to notice everything, in order to tell him and yet when  there did not think of looking. I went ten times one day, to see and  bring him an account and yet forgot it. But when I did remember to  look, I was much pleased. Yet it happened I was then asked nothing  about them.    All my crosses to me would have seemed little, if I might have had  liberty to pray and to be alone, to indulge the interior attraction  which I felt. But I was obliged to continue in their presence, with  such a subjection as is scarcely conceivable. My husband looked at his  watch, if at any time I had liberty allowed me for prayer, to see if I  stayed more than half an hour. If I exceeded, he grew very uneasy.  Sometimes I said, \"Grant me one hour to divert and employ myself as I  have a mind.\" Though he would have granted it to me for other  diversions, yet for prayer he would not. I confess that inexperience  caused me much trouble. I have often thereby given occasion for what  they made me suffer. For ought I not to have looked on my captivity as  an effect of the will of my God, to content myself and to make it my  only desire and prayer? But I often fell back again into the anxiety of  wishing to get time for prayer, which was not agreeable to my husband.  Those faults were more frequent in the beginning. Afterward I prayed to  God in His own retreat, in the temple of my heart, and I went out no  more.          CHAPTER 17      We went into the country, where I committed many faults. I thought I  might do it then because my husband diverted himself with building. If  I stayed from him he was dissatisfied. That sometimes happened as he  was continually talking with the workmen. I set myself in a corner, and  there had my work with me, but could scarcely do anything by reason of  the force of the attraction which made the work fall out of my hands. I  passed whole hours this way, without being able either to open my eyes  or know what passed; but I had nothing to wish for, nor yet to be  afraid of. Everywhere I found my proper center, because everywhere I  found God.    My heart could then desire nothing but what it had. This disposition  extinguished all its desires; and I sometimes said to myself, \"What  wantest thou? What fearest thou?\" I was surprised to find upon trial  that I had nothing to fear. Every place I was in was my proper place.    As I had generally no time allowed me for prayer but with difficulty,  and would not be suffered to rise till seven o'clock, I stole up at  four, and kneeling in my bed, I wished not to offend my husband and  strove to be punctual and assiduous in everything. But this soon  affected my health and injured my eyes, which were still weak. It was  but eight months since I had the smallpox. This loss of rest brought a  heavy trial upon me. Even my sleeping hours were much broken, by the  fear of not waking in time, I insensibly dropped asleep at my prayers.  In the half hour that I got after dinner, though I felt quite wakeful,  the drowsiness overpowered me. I endeavored to remedy this by the  severest bodily inflictions, but in vain.    As we had not yet built the chapel, and were far from any church, I  could not go to prayers or sacrament without the permission of my  husband. He was very reluctant to permit me, except on Sundays and  holidays. I could not go out in the coach, so that I was obliged to  make use of some stratagems, and to get service performed very early in  the morning, to which, feeble as I was, I made an effort to creep on  foot. It was a quarter of a league distant. Really God wrought wonders  for me. Generally, in the mornings when I went to prayers, my husband  did not awake until after I was returned. Often, as I was going out,  the weather was so cloudy, that the girl I took with me told me that I  could not go; or if I did, I should be soaked with the rain. I answered  her with my usual confidence, \"God will assist us.\" I generally reached  the chapel without being wet. While there the rain fell excessively.  When I returned it ceased. When I got home it began again with fresh  violence. During several years that I have acted this way, I have never  been deceived in my confidence. When I was in town, and could find  nobody, I was surprised that there came to me priests to ask me if I  was willing to receive the communion, and that if I was they would give  it to me. I had no mind to refuse the opportunity which Thou thyself  offered me; for I had no doubt of its being Thee who inspired them to  propose it. Before I had contrived to get divine service at the chapel  I have mentioned, I have often suddenly awoke with a strong impulse to  go to prayers. My maid would say, \"But, madam, you are going to tire  yourself in vain. There will be no service.\" For that chapel was not  yet regularly served. I went full of faith and at my arrival have found  them just ready to begin. If I could particularly enumerate the  remarkable providences which were hereupon given in my favor there  would be enough to fill whole volumes.    When I wanted to hear from, or write to Mother Granger, I often felt a  strong propensity to go to the door. There to find a messenger with a  letter from her. This is only a small instance of these kind of  continual providences. She was the only person I could be free to open  my heart to, when I could get to see her, which was with the greatest  difficulty. It was through providential assistance; because prohibited  by my confessor and husband. I placed an extreme confidence in Mother  Granger. I concealed nothing from her either of sins or pains. I did  not now practice any austerities but those she was willing to allow me.  My interior dispositions I was scarcely able to tell because I knew not  how to explain myself, being very ignorant of those matters, having  never read or heard of them.    One day when they thought I was going to see my father, I ran off to  Mother Granger. It was discovered, and cost me crosses. Their rage  against me was so excessive, that it would seem incredible. Even my  writing to her was extremely difficult. I had the utmost abhorrence of  a lie, so I forbade the footman to tell any. When they were met they  were asked whither they were going, and if they had any letters. My  mother-in-law set herself in a little passage, through which those who  went out must necessarily pass. She asked them whither they were going  and what they carried. Sometimes going on foot to the Benedictines, I  caused shoes to be carried, that they might not perceive by the dirty  ones that I had been far. I dared not go alone; those who attended me  had orders to tell of every place I went. If they were discovered to  fail, they were either corrected or discharged.    My husband and mother-in-law were always inveighing against that good  woman, though in reality they esteemed her. I sometimes made my own  complaint and she replied, \"How should you content them, when I have  been doing all in my power for twenty years to satisfy them without  success?\" For as my mother-in-law had two daughters under her care, she  was always finding something to say against everything she did in  regard to them.    But the most sensible cross to me now was the revolting of my own son  against me. They inspired him with so great a contempt for me, that I  could not bear to see him without extreme affliction. When I was in my  room with some of my friends, they sent him to listen to what we said.  As he saw this pleased them, he invented a hundred things to tell them.  If I caught him in a lie, as I frequently did, he would upbraid me,  saying, \"My grandmother says you have been a greater liar than I.\" I  answered, \"Therefore I know the deformity of that vice, and how hard a  thing it is to get the better of it; and for this reason, I would not  have you suffer the like.\" He spoke to me things very offensive.  Because he saw the awe I stood in of his grandmother and his father, if  in their absence I found fault with him for anything, he insultingly  upbraided me. He said that now I wanted to be set up over him because  they were not there. All this they approved of. One day he went to see  my father and rashly began talking against me to him, as he was used to  doing to his grandmother. But there it did not meet with the same  recompense. It affected my father to tears. Father came to our house to  desire he might be corrected for it. They promised it should be done,  and yet they never did it. I was grievously afraid of the consequences  of so bad an education. I told Mother Granger of it, who said that  since I could not remedy it, I must suffer and leave everything to God.  This child would be my cross.    Another great cross was the difficulty I had in attending my husband. I  knew he was displeased when I was not with him; yet when I was with  him, he never expressed any pleasure. On the contrary, he only rejected  with scorn whatever office I performed. He was so difficult with me  about everything, that I sometimes trembled when I approached him. I  could do nothing to his liking; and when I did not attend him he was  angry. He had taken such a dislike to soups, that he could not bear the  sight of them. Those that offered them had a rough reception. Neither  his mother nor any of the domestics would carry them to him. There was  none but I who did not refuse that office. I brought them and let his  anger pass; then I tried in some agreeable manner to prevail on him to  take them. I said to him, \"I had rather be reprimanded several times a  day, than let"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22285"],[0,"An American Suffragette (#18)"],[1,"of treatment of the maimed and the ill as in the  United States. And nowhere in the world are such new and improved  methods applied with anything like the aptness or skill as by American  doctors of medicine or surgery.    The old school, the newer school, the newest school of legally  recognized practitioners were there in force, as well as numbers of  those who were effecting remarkable cures without any special sanction  of law for their methods.    Modestly and earnestly, Dr. Earl discussed the subject that had been  assigned him, amplifying as much as his time would permit, and  occasionally citing authorities bound to command respectful attention  from scientific minds.    He was aware that he had the sympathy of most of his audience, and he  was just as fully conscious of the hostility of Drs. Morris, Tower,  Hershell, Bainbridge and two or three more of those who believed with  something approaching fanaticism that all physicians and surgeons must  adhere strictly to what they denominated \"standard methods.\"    While Leonora could not comprehend the larger significance of his  discourse, it gratified her pride and pleased her vanity that her  fiancee was a man who could obtain such a hearing from the medical  profession. The discussion that followed the address was animated and  intelligent, and if the malcontents had intended any discourtesy to Dr.  Earl their plans went awry.    Dr. Earl found himself plunged deeper and deeper every day in the  seemingly innumerable duties that crowded upon him. Summer came with  tropical heat, but feeling that he had already enjoyed a long vacation,  he made no plans, save to take his week-ends out of town, and prepared  to keep office hours all summer.    Early in July, Leonora and her mother went to Bar Harbor and the  Ramseys to Newport. Frank had gone West in May. He would have missed  them had he possessed a free moment, but the first of August found him  as busy as ever, in spite of the fact that the city was deserted by the  fashionable world. Sickness has fashions of its own, and the fame he had  achieved as \"the surgeon who cures without operating,\" brought him not a  few calls from those who had nothing to commend them save their  suffering and their faith. Every doctor worthy the name has a set of  books kept only by his recording angel, and Earl's invisible guardian  made many entries that summer, and there were times when even the  insistence of Leonora could not make him feel willing to leave those who  seemed so wholly dependent upon his presence for their physical welfare.    Now and then, in spite of his all-absorbing work, there came to his  sensitive consciousness a feeling of foreboding and dread that he could  not explain, save by some subtle law of suggestion, as he recalled half  in mirth and half in seriousness the dark prophecies of the astrologist  at the suffrage ball. He had suspected his brother Frank, and when he  learned that the seeress was Miss Renner, that suspicion had been  confirmed; Frank might have given her the date of Leonora's birthday,  but he had nothing to do with the warning she had given him that  something would happen within the next twenty-four hours which would  have a bearing on his whole career. Within two hours he had treated  little Alice Bell, and out of that event had grown his more intimate  acquaintance with Silvia, and the marked hostility of Dr. Morris. The  child was doing as well as could be expected, but he was greatly  disturbed over her condition, and was building up her general health in  the hope of overcoming the disease.    He had asked Miss Renner one or two questions, but she had evaded him,  and while he had thought of calling on her and asking for the promised  horoscope, which she did not send, the idea seemed absurd, and he had no  time to carry it out.    On the fourth of August he received a summons to come to Magnolia,  Massachusetts, to attend a former patient who was spending the summer  there, and he left New York, intending to remain a week.    His movements had become a matter of interest to the ubiquitous  newspaper reporter, and as the dog-days in New York were not prolific  in startling items, the fact of his being sent for to attend a prominent  New York man at Magnolia was seized upon and made into a fairly readable  first page news story.    He arranged for the care of his patients, saw the Bells and told them of  his intended absence, and spent some time talking with the frail little  child who had become greatly attached to him. As he rose to go, he  turned to the couch once more. \"What shall I send you from Boston,  little Miss Alice?\" he said kindly, and the girl replied in true child  fashion, \"Candy.\" He shook his head. \"You know I don't approve of much  candy for small girls; but you shall have something better,\" he said,  \"you may be sure I won't forget,\" and with another good-by he was gone.  He took the midnight train for Boston, and his patient's motor car was  waiting for him when he arrived there.    Perhaps it was the excitement of thinking what the \"something better\"  could be that kept Alice Bell awake that night; whatever it was, when  Silvia Holland saw her the next morning her heart sank. She had a  feeling that she was in some way responsible for the child also, and  that she was still Dr. Earl's assistant. She watched her while she  talked to Mrs. Bell, and suggested, in a tentative way, that Mrs. Bell  should go to some quiet country place for a month, but the woman shook  her head.    \"I cannot leave the city, now,\" she said. \"I have a great quantity of  sewing that must be done for Miss Lanier's wedding in September.\"    \"Couldn't you take it along?\" asked Silvia.    \"No,\" she said quietly, but decidedly. \"Some of the things she wants  fitted, and I have said I would be here any time she wanted to run into  town. Besides, there are other reasons why I cannot go away now.\" She  controlled herself with an effort. \"I can never tell you, Miss Holland,  how thankful I am for the work you have brought my way. You can't  understand, no woman who has never been anxious to know how she was  going to get the rent can understand what a blessing it is to be  independent! You are doing great things for all women, Miss Holland, and  not forgetting individual women as some people would, but _do_ try to  make girls understand that they can never be free so long as they are  dependent on somebody else for their bread and butter.\"    Silvia flushed. \"You're not fretting because of the paltry little sum I  advanced for your rent, are you?\" she said. \"I thought we were friends,  and such things should not be spoken of between friends.\"    The woman turned to her with a face in which gratitude and some great  sorrow were contending emotions, and caught her hands and held them  tight.    \"No,\" she said, \"I don't mind being under obligations to you; I'm almost  glad to be, for the sake of knowing such a woman. You can do a kindness  without making it a burden; there are people who pay a debt as if they  were doing you a favor. The only thing I mind is that I am not more  worthy of all you have done for me.\"    Silvia put her hands on the other woman's shoulders. \"Don't talk to me  of unworthiness,\" she said. \"You are a brave woman and a devoted mother;  it is one of the crimes of civilization that you should lack for any  creature comforts, and you shall not any more. You shall earn what you  need yourself, and this fall I intend to start a class of girls in  domestic economy, and you shall teach them how to make these pretty  things you fashion so exquisitely.\"    An indescribable look of pain and rebellion passed over Mrs. Bell's  face, and she turned away from Silvia, with a quick gesture of  renunciation.    \"In the meantime,\" Silvia went on, feeling that the time had not come to  seek any further confidence, \"I am going to borrow Alice. I want to take  her up to Nutwood for a week or two, and as I'm going this noon, suppose  you gather her things together, and I'll take her right along.\"    The little girl gave a cry of joy, and then her face dropped. \"But,  mamma,\" she said, \"will I miss my present from Dr. Earl?\"    Her mother smiled and explained that the doctor had promised to send  Allie \"something better than candy\" from Boston, where he had gone the  night before. \"I will forward it,\" she said; \"you can trust mother for  that.\"    \"He has been very good to you, hasn't he?\" said Silvia absently,  thinking of him once more as she had seen him first, as he bent over the  child, the sleeves rolled back from his powerful white arms while he  bathed the matted locks and set the broken leg.    \"He has that,\" said the woman laconically. \"I'm glad to have Allie go  with you, for she would miss him; he said he wouldn't be back for a  week. Now be a good girl, Allie, and do just as Miss Holland tells you,  and you will write mother a little letter every day, and mother will  write to you.\" She flung her arms about the child in a sudden passion of  emotion, but the eyes that looked into Silvia's as she took her hand  were dry and wretched.    \"I wish you could tell me all about it,\" Silvia said impulsively.    \"I shall, soon,\" she answered; \"unless Fate turns kind for once, I shall  tell you all, soon, very soon.\"          CHAPTER XVI    THE MYSTERIOUS MURDER OF EMMA BELL      The crowd going home from the resorts and roof gardens August 9th was  startled by the wild cries of the newsboys: \"Extra! Extra! All about the  mysterious murder!\"    Murders are not so rare in New York as to cause any genuine sensation  among its people when one is announced in the public press, but mystery  has ever been attractive to the human race, and the details of the  present case as contained in the columns of the papers were so involved  in conjecture as to arouse the interest of every reader.
