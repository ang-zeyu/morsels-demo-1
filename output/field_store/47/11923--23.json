The  filament takes the place of the contraction in the pipe.]    The manufacture of glow-lamps is now an important industry. One brand of  lamp[20] is made as follows:--First, cotton-wool is dissolved in  chloride of zinc, and forms a treacly solution, which is squirted  through a fine nozzle into a settling solution which hardens it and  makes it coil up like a very fine violin string. After being washed and  dried, it is wound on a plumbago rod and baked in a furnace until only  the carbon element remains. This is the filament in the rough. It is  next removed from the rod and tipped with two short pieces of fine  platinum wire. To make the junction electrically perfect the filament is  plunged in benzine and heated to whiteness by the passage of a strong  current, which deposits the carbon of the benzine on the joints. The  filament is now placed under the glass receiver of an air-pump, the air  is exhausted, hydro-carbon vapour is introduced, and the filament has a  current passed through it to make it white hot. Carbon from the vapour  is deposited all over the filament until the required electrical  resistance is attained. The filament is now ready for enclosure in the  bulb. When the bulb has been exhausted and sealed, the lamp is tested,  and, if passed, goes to the finishing department, where the two platinum  wires (projecting through the glass) are soldered to a couple of brass  plates, which make contact with two terminals in a lamp socket. Finally,  brass caps are affixed with a special water-tight and hard cement.      ARC LAMPS.    In _arc_ lighting, instead of a contraction at a point in the circuit,  there is an actual break of very small extent. Suppose that to the ends  of the wires leading from a dynamo's terminals we attach two carbon  rods, and touch the end of the rods together. The tips become white hot,  and if they are separated slightly, atoms of incandescent carbon leap  from the positive to the negative rod in a continuous and intensely  luminous stream, which is called an _arc_ because the path of the  particles is curved. No arc would be formed unless the carbons were  first touched to start incandescence. If they are separated too far for  the strength of the current to bridge the gap the light will flicker or  go out. The arc lamp is therefore provided with a mechanism which, when  the current is cut off, causes the carbons to fall together, gradually  separates them when it is turned on, and keeps them apart. The principle  employed is the effort of a coil through which a current passes to draw  an iron rod into its centre. Some of the current feeding the lamp is  shunted through a coil, into which projects one end of an iron bar  connected with one carbon point. A spring normally presses the points  together when no current flows. As soon as current circulates through  the coil the bar is drawn upwards against the spring.      SERIES AND PARALLEL ARRANGEMENT OF LAMPS.    When current passes from one lamp to another, as in Fig. 82, the lamps  are said to be in _series_. Should one lamp fail, all in the circuit  would go out. But where arc lamps are thus arranged a special mechanism  on each lamp \"short-circuits\" it in case of failure, so that current may  pass uninterruptedly to the next.    [Illustration: FIG. 82.--Incandescent lamps connected in \"series.\"]    Fig. 83 shows a number of lamps set _in parallel_. One terminal of each  is attached to the positive conductor, the other to the negative  conductor. Each lamp therefore forms an independent bridge, and does  not affect the efficiency of the rest. _Parallel series_ signifies a  combination of the two systems, and would be illustrated if, in Fig. 83,  two or more lamps were connected in series groups from one conductor to  the other. This arrangement is often used in arc lighting.    [Illustration: FIG. 83.--Incandescent lamps connected in \"parallel.\"]      CURRENT FOR ELECTRIC LAMPS.    This may be either direct or alternating. The former is commonly used  for arc lamps, the latter for incandescent, as it is easily stepped-down  from the high-pressure mains for use in a house. Glow-lamps usually take  current of 110 or 250 volts pressure.    In arc lamps fed with direct current the tip of the positive carbon has  a bowl-shaped depression worn in it, while the negative tip is pointed.  Most of the illumination comes from the inner surface of the bowl, and  the positive carbon is therefore placed uppermost to throw the light  downwards. An alternating current, of course, affects both carbons in  the same manner, and there is no bowl.    The carbons need frequent renewal. A powerful lamp uses about 70 feet of  rod in 1,000 hours if the arc is exposed to the air. Some lamps have  partly enclosed arcs--that is, are surrounded by globes perforated by a  single small hole, which renders combustion very slow, though preventing  a vacuum.      ELECTROPLATING.    Electroplating is the art of coating metals with metals by means of  electricity. Silver, copper, and nickel are the metals most generally  deposited. The article to be coated is suspended in a chemical solution  of the metal to be deposited. Fig. 84 shows a very simple plating  outfit. A is a battery; B a vessel containing, say, an acidulated  solution of sulphate of copper. A spoon, S, hanging in this from a glass  rod, R, is connected with the zinc or negative element, Z, of the  battery, and a plate of copper, P, with the positive element, C. Current  flows in the direction shown by the arrows, from Z to C, C to P, P to  S, S to Z. The copper deposited from the solution on the spoon is  replaced by gradual dissolution of the plate, so that the latter serves  a double purpose.    [Illustration: FIG. 84.--An electroplating outfit.]    In silver plating, P is of silver, and the solution one of cyanide of  potassium and silver salts. Where nickel or silver has to be deposited  on iron, the article is often given a preliminary coating of copper, as  iron does not make a good junction with either of the first two metals,  but has an affinity for copper.

Chapter X.    RAILWAY BRAKES.         The Vacuum Automatic brake--The Westinghouse air-brake.      In the early days of the railway, the pulling up of a train necessitated  the shutting off of steam while the stopping-place was still a great  distance away. The train gradually lost its velocity, the process being  hastened to a comparatively small degree by the screw-down brakes on the  engine and guard's van. The goods train of to-day in many cases still  observes this practice, long obsolete in passenger traffic.    An advance was made when a chain, running along the entire length of the  train, was arranged so as to pull on subsidiary chains branching off  under each carriage and operating levers connected with brake blocks  pressing on every pair of wheels. The guard strained the main chain by  means of a wheel gear in his van. This system was, however, radically  defective, since, if any one branch chain was shorter than the rest, it  alone would get the strain. Furthermore, it is obvious that the snapping  of the main chain would render the whole arrangement powerless.  Accordingly, brakes operated by steam were tried. Under every carriage  was placed a cylinder, in connection with a main steam-pipe running  under the train. When the engineer wished to apply the brakes, he turned  high-pressure steam into the train pipe, and the steam, passing into the  brake cylinders, drove out in each a piston operating the brake gear.  Unfortunately, the steam, during its passage along the pipe, was  condensed, and in cold weather failed to reach the rear carriages. Water  formed in the pipes, and this was liable to freeze. If the train parted  accidentally, the apparatus of course broke down.    Hydraulic brakes have been tried; but these are open to several  objections; and railway engineers now make use of air-pressure as the  most suitable form of power. Whatever air system be adopted, experience  has shown that three features are essential:--(1.) The brakes must be  kept \"off\" artificially. (2.) In case of the train parting accidentally,  the brakes must be applied automatically, and quickly bring all the  vehicles of the train to a standstill. (3.) It must be possible to apply  the brakes with greater or less force, according to the needs of the  case.    At the present day one or other of two systems is used on practically  all automatically-braked cars and coaches. These are known as--(1) The  _vacuum automatic_, using the pressure of the atmosphere on a piston  from the other side of which air has been mechanically exhausted; and  (2) the _Westinghouse automatic_, using compressed air. The action of  these brakes will now be explained as simply as possible.      THE VACUUM AUTOMATIC BRAKE.    Under each carriage is a vacuum chamber (Fig. 85) riding on trunnions, E  E, so that it may swing a little when the brakes are applied. Inside the  chamber is a cylinder, the piston of which is rendered air-tight by a  rubber ring rolling between it and the cylinder walls. The piston rod  works through an air-tight stuffing-box in the bottom of the casing, and  when it rises operates the brake rods. It is obvious that if air is  exhausted from both sides of the piston at once, the piston will sink by  reason of its own weight and that of its attachments. If air is now  admitted below the piston, the latter will be pushed upwards with a  maximum pressure of 15 lbs. to the square inch. The ball-valve ensures  that while air can be sucked from _both_ sides of the piston, it can be  admitted to the lower side only.

Each extra prism has the effect of  lengthening the coloured strip still more, so that lines, which at first  appeared to be single merely through being crowded together, are  eventually drawn apart and become separately distinguishable.    On this principle it has gradually been determined that the sun is  composed of elements similar to those which go to make up our earth.  Further, the composition of the stars can be ascertained in the same  manner; and we find them formed on a like pattern, though with certain  elements in greater or less proportion as the case may be. It is in  consequence of our thus definitely ascertaining that the stars are  self-luminous, and of a sun-like character, that we are enabled to speak  of them as _suns_, or to call the sun a _star_.    In endeavouring to discover the elements of which the planets and  satellites of our system are composed, we, however, find ourselves  baffled, for the simple reason that these bodies emit no real light of  their own. The light which reaches us from them, being merely reflected  sunlight, gives only the ordinary solar spectrum when examined with the  spectroscope. But in certain cases we find that the solar spectrum thus  viewed shows traces of being weakened, or rather of suffering  absorption; and it is concluded that this may be due to the sunlight  having had to pass through an atmosphere on its way to and from the  surface of the planet from which it is reflected to us.    Since the sun is found to be composed of elements similar to those which  go to make up our earth, we need not be disheartened at this failure of  the spectroscope to inform us of the composition of the planets and  satellites. We are justified, indeed, in assuming that more or less the  same constituents run through our solar system; and that the elements of  which these bodies are composed are similar to those which are found  upon our earth and in the sun.    The spectroscope supplies us with even more information. It tells us,  indeed, whether the sun-like body which we are observing is moving away  from us or towards us. A certain slight shifting of the lines towards  the red or violet end of the spectrum respectively, is found to follow  such movement. This method of observation is known by the name of  _Doppler's Method_,[9] and by it we are enabled to confirm the evidence  which the sunspots give us of the rotation of the sun; for we find thus  that one edge of that body is continually approaching us, and the other  edge is continually receding from us. Also, we can ascertain in the same  manner that certain of the stars are moving towards us, and certain of  them away from us.      [9] The idea, initiated by Christian Doppler at Prague in 1842, was  originally applied to sound. The approach or recession of a source from  which sound is coming is invariably accompanied by alterations of pitch,  as the reader has no doubt noticed when a whistling railway-engine has  approached him or receded from him. It is to Sir William Huggins,  however, that we are indebted for the application of the principle to  spectroscopy. This he gave experimental proof of in the year 1868.          CHAPTER XII    THE SUN      The sun is the chief member of our system. It controls the motions of  the planets by its immense gravitative power. Besides this it is the  most important body in the entire universe, so far as we are concerned;  for it pours out continually that flood of light and heat, without which  life, as we know it, would quickly become extinct upon our globe.    Light and heat, though not precisely the same thing, may be regarded,  however, as next-door neighbours. The light rays are those which  directly affect the eye and are comprised in the visible spectrum. We  _feel_ the heat rays, the chief of which are beyond the red portion of  the spectrum. They may be investigated with the _bolometer_, an  instrument invented by the late Professor Langley. Chemical rays--for  instance, those radiations which affect the photographic plate--are for  the most part also outside the visible spectrum. They are, however, at  the other end of it, namely, beyond the violet.    Such a scale of radiations may be compared to the keyboard of an  imaginary piano, the sound from only one of whose octaves is audible to  us.    The brightest light we know on the earth is dull compared with the light  of the sun. It would, indeed, look quite dark if held up against it.    It is extremely difficult to arrive at a precise notion of the  temperature of the body of the sun. However, it is far in excess of any  temperature which we can obtain here, even in the most powerful electric  furnace.    A rough idea of the solar heat may be gathered from the calculation that  if the sun's surface were coated all over with a layer of ice 4000 feet  thick, it would melt through this completely in one hour.    The sun cannot be a hot body merely cooling; for the rate at which it is  at present giving off heat could not in such circumstances be kept up,  according to Professor Moulton, for more than 3000 years. Further, it is  not a mere burning mass, like a coal fire, for instance; as in that case  about a thousand years would show a certain drop in temperature. No  perceptible diminution of solar heat having taken place within historic  experience, so far as can be ascertained, we are driven to seek some  more abstruse explanation.    The theory which seems to have received most acceptance is that put  forward by Helmholtz in 1854. His idea was that gravitation produces  continual contraction, or falling in of the outer parts of the sun; and  that this falling in, in its turn, generates enough heat to compensate  for what is being given off. The calculations of Helmholtz showed that a  contraction of about 100 feet a year from the surface towards the centre  would suffice for the purpose. In recent years, however, this estimate  has been extended to about 180 feet. Nevertheless, even with this  increased figure, the shrinkage required is so slight in comparison with  the immense girth of the sun, that it would take a continual  contraction at this rate for about 6000 years, to show even in our  finest telescopes that any change in the size of that body was taking  place at all. Upon this assumption of continuous contraction, a time  should, however, eventually be reached when the sun will have shrunk to  such a degree of solidity, that it will not be able to shrink any  further. Then, the loss of heat not being made up for any longer, the  body of the sun should begin to grow cold. But we need not be distressed  on this account; for it will take some 10,000,000 years, according to  the above theory, before the solar orb becomes too cold to support life  upon our earth.    Since the discovery of radium it has, on the other hand, been suggested,  and not unreasonably, that radio-active matter may possibly play an  important part in keeping up the heat of the sun. But the body of  scientific opinion appears to consider the theory of contraction as a  result of gravitation, which has been outlined above, to be of itself  quite a sound explanation. Indeed, the late Lord Kelvin is said to have  held to the last that it was amply sufficient to account for the  underground heat of the earth, the heat of the sun, and that of all the  stars in the universe.    One great difficulty in forming theories with regard to the sun, is the  fact that the temperature and gravitation there are enormously in excess  of anything we meet with upon our earth. The force of gravity at the  sun's surface is, indeed, about twenty-seven times that at the surface  of our globe.    The earth's atmosphere appears to absorb about one-half of the  radiations which come to us from the sun. This absorptive effect is very  noticeable when the solar orb is low down in our sky, for its light and  heat are then clearly much reduced. Of the light rays, the blue ones are  the most easily absorbed in this way; which explains why the sun looks  red when near the horizon. It has then, of course, to shine through a  much greater thickness of atmosphere than when high up in the heavens.    What astonishes one most about the solar radiation, is the immense  amount of it that is apparently wasted into space in comparison with  what falls directly upon the bodies of the solar system. Only about the  one-hundred-millionth is caught by all the planets together. What  becomes of the rest we cannot tell.    That brilliant white body of the sun, which we see, is enveloped by  several layers of gases and vaporous matter, in the same manner as our  globe is enveloped by its atmosphere (see Fig. 10, p. 131). These are  transparent, just as our atmosphere is transparent; and so we see the  white bright body of the sun right through them.    This white bright portion is called the _Photosphere_. From it comes  most of that light and heat which we see and feel. We do not know what  lies under the photosphere, but, no doubt, the more solid portions of  the sun are there situated. Just above the photosphere, and lying close  upon it, is a veil of smoke-like haze.    Next upon this is what is known as the _Reversing Layer_, which is  between 500 and 1000 miles in thickness. It is cooler than the  underlying photosphere, and is composed of glowing gases. Many of the  elements which go to make up our earth are present in the reversing  layer in the form of vapour.    The _Chromosphere_, of which especial mention has already been made in  dealing with eclipses of the sun, is another layer lying immediately  upon the last one. It is between 5000 and 10,000 miles in thickness.  Like the reversing layer, it is composed of glowing gases, chief among  which is the vapour of hydrogen. The colour of the chromosphere is, in  reality, a brilliant scarlet; but, as we have already said, the  intensely white light of the"]]]
