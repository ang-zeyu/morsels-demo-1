Half an hour more and Mrs. Dudley's compliments. \"Mrs.  Dudley heard that Mrs. Walter was out of milk, and took the liberty to  send round some very particularly nice Scotch groats, which her brother  had just brought from Edinburgh.\" \"Do your best with it, Fanny,\" said  poor Mary, but she knew that if Jamie took those Scotch groats it was  only because they were a Christmas present. Half an hour more! Three  more spoonfuls of beef-tea after a fight. Door-bell again. Carriage at  the door. \"Would Mrs. Walter come down and see Mrs. Fitch? It was really  very particular.\" Mary was half dazed, and went down, she did not know  why.    \"Dear Mrs. Walter, you do not remember me,\" said this eager girl,  crossing the room and taking her by both hands.    \"Why, no--yes--do I?\" said Mary, crying and laughing together.    \"Yes, you will remember, it was at church, at the baptism. My Jennie and  your Jamie were christened the same day. And now I hear,--we all know  how low he is,--and perhaps he will share my Jennie's breakfast. Dear  Mrs. Walter, do let me try.\"    Then Mary saw that the little woman's cloak and hat were already thrown  off,--which had not seemed strange to her before,--and the two passed  quietly up stairs together; and Julia Fitch bent gently over him, and  cooed to him, and smiled to him, but could not make the poor child  smile. And they lifted him so gently on the pillow,--but only to hear  him scream. And she brought his head gently to her heart, and drew back  the little curtain that was left, and offered to him her life; but he  was frightened, and did not know her, and had forgotten what it was she  gave him, and screamed again; and so they had to lay him back gently  upon the pillow. And then,--as Julia was saying she would stay, and how  they could try again, and could do this and that,--then the door-bell  rang again, and Mrs. Coleman had herself come round with a little white  pitcher, and herself ran up stairs with it, and herself knocked at the  door!    The blockade was broken, and    THE MILK HAD COME!           *       *       *       *       *    Mary never knew that it was from Huldah Stevens's milk-can that her boy  drank in the first drop of his new life. Nor did Huldah know it. Nor  did John know it, nor the paladins who fought that day at his side. Nor  did Silas Lovejoy know it.    But the good God and all good angels knew it. Why ask for more?    And you and I, dear reader, if we can forget that always our daily bread  comes to us, because a thousand brave men and a thousand brave women are  at work in the world, praying to God and trying to serve him, we will  not forget it as we meet at breakfast on this blessed Christmas day!          STAND AND WAIT.      I.    CHRISTMAS EVE.    \"They've come! they've come!\"    This was the cry of little Herbert as he ran in from the square stone  which made the large doorstep of the house. Here he had been watching, a  self-posted sentinel, for the moment when the carriage should turn the  corner at the bottom of the hill.    \"They've come! they've come!\" echoed joyfully through the house; and the  cry penetrated out into the extension, or ell, in which the grown  members of the family were, in the kitchen, \"getting tea\" by some  formulas more solemn than ordinary.    \"Have they come?\" cried Grace; and she set her skillet back to the  quarter-deck, or after-part of the stove, lest its white contents  should burn while she was away. She threw a waiting handkerchief over  her shoulders, and ran with the others to the front door, to wave  something white, and to be in at the first welcome.    Young and old were gathered there in that hospitable open space where  the side road swept up to the barn on its way from the main road. The  bigger boys of the home party had scattered half-way down the hill by  this time. Even grandmamma had stepped down from the stone, and walked  half-way to the roadway. Every one was waving something. Those who had  no handkerchiefs had hats or towels to wave; and the more advanced boys  began an undefined or irregular cheer.    But the carryall advanced slowly up the hill, with no answering  handkerchief, and no bonneted head stretched out from the side. And, as  it neared Sam and Andrew, their enthusiasm could be seen to droop, and  George and Herbert stopped their cheers as it came up to them; and  before it was near the house, on its grieved way up the hill, the bad  news had come up before it, as bad news will,--\"She has not come, after  all.\"    It was Huldah Root, Grace's older sister, who had not come. John Root,  their father, had himself driven down to the station to meet her; and  Abner, her oldest brother, had gone with him. It was two years since she  had been at home, and the whole family was on tiptoe to welcome her.  Hence the unusual tea preparation; hence the sentinel on the doorstep;  hence the general assembly in the yard; and, after all, she had not  come! It was a wretched disappointment. Her mother had that heavy,  silent look, which children take as the heaviest affliction of all, when  they see it in their mother's faces. John Root himself led the horse  into the barn, as if he did not care now for anything which might happen  in heaven above or in earth beneath. The boys were voluble in their  rage: \"It is too bad!\" and, \"Grandmamma, don't you think it is too bad?\"  and, \"It is the meanest thing I ever heard of in all my life!\" and,  \"Grace, why don't you say anything? did you ever know anything so mean?\"  As for poor Grace herself, she was quite beyond saying anything. All the  treasured words she had laid up to say to Huldah; all the doubts and  hopes and guesses, which were secret to all but God, but which were to  be poured out in Huldah's ear as soon as they were alone, were coming  up one by one, as if to choke her. She had waited so long for this  blessed fortnight of sympathy, and now she had lost it. Grace could say  nothing. And poor grandmamma, on whom fell the stilling of the boys, was  at heart as wretched as any of them.    Somehow, something got itself put on the supper-table; and, when John  Root and Abner came in from the barn, they all sat down to pretend to  eat something. What a miserable contrast to the Christmas eve party  which had been expected!    The observance of Christmas is quite a novelty in the heart of New  England among the lords of the manor. Winslow and Brewster, above  Plymouth Rock, celebrated their first Christmas by making all hands work  all day in the raising of their first house. It was in that way that a  Christian empire was begun. They builded better than they knew. They and  theirs, in that hard day's work, struck the key-note for New England for  two centuries and a half. And many and many a New Englander, still in  middle life, remembers that in childhood, though nurtured in Christian  homes, he could not have told, if he were asked, on what day of the  year Christmas fell. But as New England, in the advance of the world,  has come into the general life of the world, she has shown no inaptitude  for the greater enjoyments of life; and, with the true catholicity of  her great Congregational system, her people and her churches seize, one  after another, all the noble traditions of the loftiest memories. And so  in this matter we have in hand; it happened that the Roots, in their  hillside home, had determined that they would celebrate Christmas, as  never had Roots done before since Josiah Root landed at Salem, from the  \"Hercules,\" with other Kentish people, in 1635. Abner and Gershom had  cut and trimmed a pretty fir-balsam from the edge of the Hotchkiss  clearing; and it was now in the best parlor. Grace, with Mary Bickford,  her firm ally and other self, had gilded nuts, and rubbed lady apples,  and strung popped corn; and the tree had been dressed in secret, the  youngsters all locked and warned out from the room. The choicest turkeys  of the drove, and the tenderest geese from the herd, and the plumpest  fowls from the barnyard, had been sacrificed on consecrated altars. And  all this was but as accompaniment and side illustration of the great  glory of the celebration, which was, that Huldah, after her two years'  absence,--Huldah was to come home.    And now she had not come,--nay, was not coming!    As they sat down at their Barmecide feast, how wretched the assemblage  of unrivalled dainties seemed! John Root handed to his wife their  daughter's letter; she read it, and gave it to Grace, who read it, and  gave it to her grandmother. No one read it aloud. To read aloud in such  trials is not the custom of New England.            Boston, Dec. 24, 1848.        DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,--It is dreadful to disappoint you all,      but I cannot come. I am all ready, and this goes by the carriage      that was to take me to the cars. But our dear little Horace has      just been brought home, I am afraid, dying; but we cannot tell,      and I cannot leave him. You know there is really no one who can      do what I can. He was riding on his pony. First the pony came      home alone; and, in five minutes after, two policemen brought      the dear child in a carriage. His poor mother is very calm, but      cannot think yet, or do anything. We have sent for his father,      who is down town. I try to hope that he may come to himself; but      he only lies and draws long breaths on his little bed. The      doctors are with him now; and I write this little scrawl to say      how dreadfully sorry I am. A merry Christmas to you all. Do not      be troubled about me.            Your own loving              HULDAH.        P.S. I have got some little presents for the children; but they      are all in my trunk, and I cannot get them out now. I will make      a bundle Monday. Good-by. The man is waiting.    This was the letter that was passed from hand to hand, of which the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261"],[0,"News from Nowhere; Or, An Epoch of Rest (#18)"],[1,"of opinion in one and the same community.  Do you assert that  there are none?\"    \"No, not at all,\" said he, somewhat snappishly; \"but I do say that  differences of opinion about real solid things need not, and with us do  not, crystallise people into parties permanently hostile to one another,  with different theories as to the build of the universe and the progress  of time.  Isn't that what politics used to mean?\"    \"H'm, well,\" said I, \"I am not so sure of that.\"    Said he: \"I take, you, neighbour; they only _pretended_ to this serious  difference of opinion; for if it had existed they could not have dealt  together in the ordinary business of life; couldn't have eaten together,  bought and sold together, gambled together, cheated other people  together, but must have fought whenever they met: which would not have  suited them at all.  The game of the masters of politics was to cajole or  force the public to pay the expense of a luxurious life and exciting  amusement for a few cliques of ambitious persons: and the _pretence_ of  serious difference of opinion, belied by every action of their lives, was  quite good enough for that.  What has all that got to do with us?\"    Said I: \"Why, nothing, I should hope.  But I fear--In short, I have been  told that political strife was a necessary result of human nature.\"    \"Human nature!\" cried the old boy, impetuously; \"what human nature?  The  human nature of paupers, of slaves, of slave-holders, or the human nature  of wealthy freemen?  Which?  Come, tell me that!\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"I suppose there would be a difference according to  circumstances in people's action about these matters.\"    \"I should think so, indeed,\" said he.  \"At all events, experience shows  that it is so.  Amongst us, our differences concern matters of business,  and passing events as to them, and could not divide men permanently.  As  a rule, the immediate outcome shows which opinion on a given subject is  the right one; it is a matter of fact, not of speculation.  For instance,  it is clearly not easy to knock up a political party on the question as  to whether haymaking in such and such a country-side shall begin this  week or next, when all men agree that it must at latest begin the week  after next, and when any man can go down into the fields himself and see  whether the seeds are ripe enough for the cutting.\"    Said I: \"And you settle these differences, great and small, by the will  of the majority, I suppose?\"    \"Certainly,\" said he; \"how else could we settle them?  You see in matters  which are merely personal which do not affect the welfare of the  community--how a man shall dress, what he shall eat and drink, what he  shall write and read, and so forth--there can be no difference of  opinion, and everybody does as he pleases.  But when the matter is of  common interest to the whole community, and the doing or not doing  something affects everybody, the majority must have their way; unless the  minority were to take up arms and show by force that they were the  effective or real majority; which, however, in a society of men who are  free and equal is little likely to happen; because in such a community  the apparent majority _is_ the real majority, and the others, as I have  hinted before, know that too well to obstruct from mere pigheadedness;  especially as they have had plenty of opportunity of putting forward  their side of the question.\"    \"How is that managed?\" said I.    \"Well,\" said he, \"let us take one of our units of management, a commune,  or a ward, or a parish (for we have all three names, indicating little  real distinction between them now, though time was there was a good  deal).  In such a district, as you would call it, some neighbours think  that something ought to be done or undone: a new town-hall built; a  clearance of inconvenient houses; or say a stone bridge substituted for  some ugly old iron one,--there you have undoing and doing in one.  Well,  at the next ordinary meeting of the neighbours, or Mote, as we call it,  according to the ancient tongue of the times before bureaucracy, a  neighbour proposes the change, and of course, if everybody agrees, there  is an end of discussion, except about details.  Equally, if no one backs  the proposer,--'seconds him,' it used to be called--the matter drops for  the time being; a thing not likely to happen amongst reasonable men,  however, as the proposer is sure to have talked it over with others  before the Mote.  But supposing the affair proposed and seconded, if a  few of the neighbours disagree to it, if they think that the beastly iron  bridge will serve a little longer and they don't want to be bothered with  building a new one just then, they don't count heads that time, but put  off the formal discussion to the next Mote; and meantime arguments _pro_  and _con_ are flying about, and some get printed, so that everybody knows  what is going on; and when the Mote comes together again there is a  regular discussion and at last a vote by show of hands.  If the division  is a close one, the question is again put off for further discussion; if  the division is a wide one, the minority are asked if they will yield to  the more general opinion, which they often, nay, most commonly do.  If  they refuse, the question is debated a third time, when, if the minority  has not perceptibly grown, they always give way; though I believe there  is some half-forgotten rule by which they might still carry it on  further; but I say, what always happens is that they are convinced, not  perhaps that their view is the wrong one, but they cannot persuade or  force the community to adopt it.\"    \"Very good,\" said I; \"but what happens if the divisions are still  narrow?\"    Said he: \"As a matter of principle and according to the rule of such  cases, the question must then lapse, and the majority, if so narrow, has  to submit to sitting down under the _status quo_.  But I must tell you  that in point of fact the minority very seldom enforces this rule, but  generally yields in a friendly manner.\"    \"But do you know,\" said I, \"that there is something in all this very like  democracy; and I thought that democracy was considered to be in a  moribund condition many, many years ago.\"    The old boy's eyes twinkled.  \"I grant you that our methods have that  drawback.  But what is to be done?  We can't get _anyone_ amongst us to  complain of his not always having his own way in the teeth of the  community, when it is clear that _everybody_ cannot have that indulgence.  What is to be done?\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"I don't know.\"    Said he: \"The only alternatives to our method that I can conceive of are  these.  First, that we should choose out, or breed, a class of superior  persons capable of judging on all matters without consulting the  neighbours; that, in short, we should get for ourselves what used to be  called an aristocracy of intellect; or, secondly, that for the purpose of  safe-guarding the freedom of the individual will, we should revert to a  system of private property again, and have slaves and slave-holders once  more.  What do you think of those two expedients?\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"there is a third possibility--to wit, that every man  should be quite independent of every other, and that thus the tyranny of  society should be abolished.\"    He looked hard at me for a second or two, and then burst out laughing  very heartily; and I confess that I joined him.  When he recovered  himself he nodded at me, and said: \"Yes, yes, I quite agree with you--and  so we all do.\"    \"Yes,\" I said, \"and besides, it does not press hardly on the minority:  for, take this matter of the bridge, no man is obliged to work on it if  he doesn't agree to its building.  At least, I suppose not.\"    He smiled, and said: \"Shrewdly put; and yet from the point of view of the  native of another planet.  If the man of the minority does find his  feelings hurt, doubtless he may relieve them by refusing to help in  building the bridge.  But, dear neighbour, that is not a very effective  salve for the wound caused by the 'tyranny of a majority' in our society;  because all work that is done is either beneficial or hurtful to every  member of society.  The man is benefited by the bridge-building if it  turns out a good thing, and hurt by it if it turns out a bad one, whether  he puts a hand to it or not; and meanwhile he is benefiting the bridge-  builders by his work, whatever that may be.  In fact, I see no help for  him except the pleasure of saying 'I told you so' if the bridge-building  turns out to be a mistake and hurts him; if it benefits him he must  suffer in silence.  A terrible tyranny our Communism, is it not?  Folk  used often to be warned against this very unhappiness in times past, when  for every well-fed, contented person you saw a thousand miserable  starvelings.  Whereas for us, we grow fat and well-liking on the tyranny;  a tyranny, to say the truth, not to be made visible by any microscope I  know.  Don't be afraid, my friend; we are not going to seek for troubles  by calling our peace and plenty and happiness by ill names whose very  meaning we have forgotten!\"    He sat musing for a little, and then started and said: \"Are there any  more questions, dear guest?  The morning is waning fast amidst my  garrulity?\"          CHAPTER XV: ON THE LACK OF INCENTIVE TO LABOUR IN A COMMUNIST SOCIETY      \"Yes,\" said I.  \"I was expecting Dick and Clara to make their appearance  any moment: but is there time to ask just one or two questions before  they come?\"    \"Try it, dear neighbour--try it,\" said old Hammond.  \"For the more you  ask me the better I am pleased; and at any rate if they do come and find  me in the middle of an answer, they must sit quiet and pretend to listen  till I come to an end.  It won't hurt them; they will find it quite  amusing enough to sit side by side, conscious of their proximity to each  other.\"    I"]]]
