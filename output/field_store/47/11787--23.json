When this stage is reached, or  even before, the electrodes may be connected up to the coil and a  discharge sent through the tube.    Care must be taken to stop the discharge as soon as a purple glow  begins to appear, because when this happens, the resistance of the  tube is very low, the electrodes get very hot, and may easily get  damaged by a powerful discharge, and the platinum of the anode (if a  focus tube is in question) begins to be distilled on to the glass.  The heating and sparking are to be continued till the resistance of  the tube sharply increases.  This is tested by always having a spark  gap, conveniently formed by the coil terminals, in parallel with the  tube.  If the terminals are points, it is convenient to set them at  about one quarter of an inch distance apart.    As soon as sparks begin to pass between the terminals of the spark gap  it becomes necessary to watch the process of exhaustion very  carefully.  In the first place, stop the pump, but let the coil run,  and note whether the sparks  continue to flow over the terminals.  If  the glass and electrodes are getting gas free, the discharge will  continue to pass by the spark gap, but if gas is still being freely  given off, then in perhaps three minutes the discharge will return to  the tube, and pumping must be recommenced.  The Roentgen effect only  begins to appear when the tube has got to so high a state of  exhaustion that the resistance increases rapidly.    By pumping and sparking, the resistance of the tube may be gradually  raised till the spark would rather jump over 2 inches of air than go  through the tube.  When this state is attained the Roentgen effect as  tested by a screen of calcium tungstate should be very brilliant.  No  conclusion as to the equivalent resistance of the tube can be arrived  at so long as the discharge is kept going continually.  When the spark  would rather go over an inch of air in the spark gap than through the  tube the pumping and sparking may be interrupted and the tube allowed  to rest for, say, five minutes.  It will generally be found that the  equivalent resistance of the tube will be largely increased by this  period of quiescence.  It may even be found that the spark will now  prefer to pass an air gap 3 inches long.    In any case the sparking should now be continued, the pump being at  rest, and the variations of tube resistance watched by adjusting the  spark gap.  If the resistance falls below an equivalent of 2 inches of  air in the gap the pump must be brought into action again and  continued until the resistance as thus estimated remains fairly  constant for, say, ten minutes.  When this occurs the narrow neck of  the exhaust tube may be strongly heated till the blow-pipe flame  begins to show traces of sodium light.  The flame must then be  withdrawn and the discharge again tested.  This is necessary because  it occasionally happens that gas is given off during the heating of  the neck to the neighbourhood of its fusion temperature.    If all is right the neck may now be fused entirely off and the tube is  finished.  Tubes of the focus pattern with large platinum anodes are  in general (in my experience) much more difficult to exhaust than  tubes of the kind first described.  This is possibly to be attributed  mainly to the gas given off by the platinum, but is also, no doubt,  due to the tubes being much larger and exposing a larger glass  surface.  The type of tube described first generally takes about two  hours to exhaust by a pump made as explained, while a \"focus\" tube has  taken as long as nine hours, eight of which have been consumed after  the tube was exhausted to the hammering point.    The pressure at which the maximum heating of the anode by the cathode  rays occurs is a good deal higher than that at which the maximum  Roentgen effect is produced.  There is little doubt that the Roentgen  radiation changes in nature to some extent as the vacuum improves  either as a primary or secondary effect.  It is therefore of some  importance to test the tube for the purpose for which it is to be used  during the actual exhaustion.  It has been stated, for instance, that  the relative penetrability of bone and flesh to Roentgen radiation  attains a maximum difference at a certain pressure;  this is very  likely the case.  Whether this effect is a direct function of the  density of the gas in the tube, or whether it is dependent on the  voltage or time integral of the current during the discharge, are  questions which still await a solution.    The preparation of calcium tungstate for fluorescent screens is very  simple.    Commercial sodium tungstate is fused with dried calcium chloride in  the proportion of three parts of the former to two parts of the  latter, both constituents being in fine powder and well mixed  together.  The fusion is conducted in a Fletcher's crucible furnace in  a clay crucible.  The temperature is raised as rapidly as possible to  the highest point which the furnace will attain--i.e.  a pure white  heat.  At this temperature the mixture of salts becomes partly fluid,  or at least pasty, and the temperature may be kept at its highest  point for, say, a quarter of an hour.  At the end of this time the  mass is poured and scraped on to a brick, and when cold is broken up  and boiled with a large excess of water to dissolve out all soluble  matter.  The insoluble part, which consists of a gray shining powder,  is washed several times with hot water, and is finally dried on  filter paper in a water oven.    In order to prepare a screen the powder is ground slightly with very  dilute shellac varnish, and is then floated over a glass plate so as  to get an even covering.  Unless the covering be very even the screen  is useless, and no pains should be spared to secure evenness.  It is  not exactly easy to get a regular coat of the fluorescent material,  but it may be done with a little care.    CHAPTER II    GLASS-GRINDING AND OPTICIANS' WORK    Sec. 52.  As no instructions of any practical value in this art have, so  far as I know, appeared in any book in English, though a great deal of  valuable information has been given in the English Mechanic and  elsewhere, I shall deal with the matter sufficiently fully for all  practical purposes.  On the other hand, I do not propose to treat of  all the methods which have been proposed, but only those requisite for  the production of the results claimed.  The student is requested to  read through the chapter before commencing any particular operation.    Sec. 53.  The simplest way will be to describe the process of manufacture  of some standard optical appliance, from which a general idea of the  nature of the operations will be obtained.  After this preliminary  account special methods may be considered in detail.  I will begin  with an account of the construction of an achromatic object glass for  a telescope, not because a student in a physical laboratory will often  require to make one, but because it illustrates the usual processes  very well; and requires to be well and accurately made.    A knowledge of the ordinary principles of optics on the part of the  reader is assumed, for there are plenty of books on the theory of  lenses, and, in any case, it is my intention to treat of the art  rather than of the science of the subject.  By far the best short  statement of the principles involved which I have seen is Lord  Rayleigh's article on Optics in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and this  is amply sufficient.    The first question that crops up is, of course, the subject of the  choice of glass.  It is obvious that the glass must be uniform in  refractive index throughout, and that it must be free from air bubbles  or bits of opaque matter.  [Footnote: The complete testing of glass  for uniformity of refractive index can only be arrived at by grinding  and polishing a sufficient portion of the surfaces to enable an  examination to be made of every part.  In the case of a small disc it  is sufficient to polish two or three facets on the edge, and to  examine the glass in a field of uniform illumination through the  windows thus formed.  Very slight irregularities will cause a \"mirage\"  easily recognised.]    The simplest procedure is to obtain glass of the desired quality from  Messrs.  Chance of Birmingham, according to the following abbreviated  list of names and refractive indices, which may be relied upon:-    Density.   Refractive Index.           C      D        F    G    Hard crown    2.85 1.5146 1.5172 1.5232 1.5280    Soft crown    2.55 1.5119 1.5146 1.5210 1.5263    Light flint    3.21 1.5700 1.5740 1.5839 1.5922    Dense flint    3.66 1 6175 1.6224 1.6348 1.6453    Extra dense flint    3.85 1.6450 1.6504 1.6643 1.6761    Double extra dense flint    4.45 1.7036 1.7103 1.7273 ...    The above glasses may be had in sheets from 0.25 to 1 inch thick, and  6 to 12 inches square, at a cost of, say, 7s.  6d.  per pound.    Discs can also be obtained of any reasonable size.  Discs 2 inches in  diameter cost about L1 per dozen, discs 3 inches in diameter about  10s.  each.  The price of discs increases enormously with the size.  A  16-inch disc will cost about L100.    For special purposes, where the desired quality of glass does not  appear on the list, an application may be made to the Jena Factory of  Herr Schott.  In order to give a definite example, I may mention that  for ordinary telescopic objectives good results may be obtained by  combining the hard crown and dense flint of Chance's list, using the  crown to form a double convex, and the flint to form a double concave  lens.  The convex lens is placed in the more outward position in the  telescope, i.e.  the light passes first through it.
