[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28536"],[0,"The Astronomy of the Bible (#18)"],[1," its tail was broad, with one  bright and curving edge, the other fainter and finer, the whole making  up a stupendous semi-circular blade-like object. Later, the tail was  shaped like a scimitar, and later again, it assumed a duplex form.    Though the bulk of comets is huge, they contain extraordinarily little  substance. Their heads must contain some solid matter, but it is  probably in the form of a loose aggregation of stones enveloped in  vaporous material. There is some reason to suppose that comets are apt  to shed some of these stones as they travel along their paths, for the  orbits of the meteors that cause some of our greatest \"star showers\" are  coincident with the paths of comets that have been observed.    But it is not only by shedding its loose stones that a comet diminishes  its bulk; it loses also through its tail. As the comet gets close to the  sun its head becomes heated, and throws off concentric envelopes, much  of which consists of matter in an extremely fine state of division. Now  it has been shown that the radiations of the sun have the power of  repelling matter, whilst the sun itself attracts by its gravitational  force. But there is a difference in the action of the two forces. The  light-pressure varies with the surface of the particle upon which it is  exercised; the gravitational attraction varies with the mass or volume.  If we consider the behaviour of very small particles, it follows that  the attraction due to gravitation (depending on the volume of the  particle) will diminish more rapidly than the repulsion due to  light-pressure (depending on the surface of the particle), as we  decrease continually the size of the particle, since its volume  diminishes more rapidly than its surface. A limit therefore will be  reached below which the repulsion will become greater than the  attraction. Thus for particles less than the 1/25000 part of an inch in  diameter the repulsion of the sun is greater than its attraction.  Particles in the outer envelope of the comet below this size will be  driven away in a continuous stream, and will form that thin, luminous  fog which we see as the comet's tail.    We cannot tell whether such objects as these were present to the mind of  Joel when he spoke of \"blood and fire and pillars of smoke\"; possibly  these metaphors are better explained by a sand- or thunder-storm,  especially when we consider that the Hebrew expression for the \"pillars  of smoke\" indicates a resemblance to a palm-tree, as in the spreading  out of the head of a sand- or thunder-cloud in the sky. The suggestion  has been made,--following the closing lines of _Paradise Lost_ (for  Milton is responsible for many of our interpretations of Scripture)                         \"High in front advanced,       The brandished sword of God before them blazed,       Fierce as a comet,\"    --that a comet was indeed the \"flaming sword which turned every way, to  keep the way of the tree of life.\" There is less improbability in the  suggestion made by several writers that, when the pestilence wasted  Jerusalem, and David offered up the sacrifice of intercession in the  threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, the king may have seen, in the  scimitar-like tail of a comet such as Donati's, God's \"minister,\"--\"a  flame of fire,\"--\"the angel of the Lord stand between the earth and the  heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem.\"    The late R. A. Proctor describes the wanderings of a comet thus:--         \"A comet is seen in the far distant depths of space as a       faint and scarcely discernible speck. It draws nearer and       nearer with continually increasing velocity, growing       continually larger and brighter. Faster and faster it rushes       on until it makes its nearest approach to our sun, and then,       sweeping round him, it begins its long return voyage into       infinite space. As it recedes it grows fainter and fainter,       until at length it passes beyond the range of the most       powerful telescopes made by man, and is seen no more. It has       been seen for the first and last time by the generation of men       to whom it has displayed its glories. It has been seen for the       first and last time by the race of man itself.\"[108:1]         \"These are . . . wandering stars, to whom is reserved the       blackness of darkness for ever.\"        FOOTNOTES:    [108:1] R.

[Illustration: FALL OF AN AEROLITE.    \"There fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp.\" (_see_  p. 116).]          CHAPTER X    METEORS      Great meteorites--\"aerolites\" as they are called--are like great comets,  chance visitors to our world. Now and then they come, but we cannot  foretell their coming. Such an aerolite exploded some fifteen miles  above Madrid at about 9{h} 29{m}, on the morning of February 10, 1896:--         \"A vivid glare of blinding light was followed in 1-1/2 minutes       by a loud report, the concussion being such as not merely to       create a panic, but to break many windows, and in some cases       to shake down partitions. The sky was clear, and the sun       shining brightly, when a white cloud, bordered with red, was       seen rushing from south-west to north-east, leaving behind it       a train of fine white dust. A red-tinted cloud was long       visible in the east.\"    Many fragments were picked up, and analyzed, and, like other aerolites,  were found to consist of materials already known on the earth. The outer  crust showed the signs of fire,--the meteoric stone had been fused and  ignited by its very rapid rush through the air--but the interior was  entirely unaffected by the heat. The manner in which the elements were  combined is somewhat peculiar to aerolites; the nearest terrestrial  affinity of the minerals aggregated in them, is to be found in the  volcanic products from great depths. Thus aerolites seem to be broken-up  fragments from the interior parts of globes like our own. They do not  come from our own volcanoes, for the velocities with which they entered  our atmosphere prove their cosmical origin. Had our atmosphere not  entangled them, many, circuiting the sun in a parabolic or hyperbolic  curve, would have escaped for ever from our system. The swift motions,  which they had on entering our atmosphere, are considerably greater on  the average than those of comets, and probably their true home is not in  our solar system, but in interstellar space.    The aerolites that reach the surface are not always exploded into very  small fragments, but every now and then quite large masses remain  intact. Most of these are stony; some have bits of iron scattered  through them; others are almost pure iron, or with a little nickel  alloy, or have pockets in them laden with stone. There are hundreds of  accounts of the falls of aerolites during the past 2,500 years. The  Greeks and Romans considered them as celestial omens, and kept some of  them in temples. One at Mecca is revered by the faithful Mohammedans,  and Jehangir, the great Mogul, is said to have had a sword forged from  an iron aerolite which fell in 1620 in the Panjab. Diana of Ephesus  stood on a shapeless block which, tradition says, was a meteoric stone,  and reference may perhaps be found to this in the speech of the  town-clerk of the city to appease the riot stirred up against St. Paul  by Demetrius the silversmith and his companions:--         \"Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who knoweth not how       that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great       Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?\"    Aerolites come singly and unexpectedly, falling actually to earth on  land or sea. \"Shooting stars\" come usually in battalions. They travel  together in swarms, and the earth may meet the same swarm again and  again. They are smaller than aerolites, probably mere particles of dust,  and for the most part are entirely consumed in our upper atmosphere, so  that they do not actually reach the earth. The swarms travel along paths  that resemble cometary orbits; they are very elongated ellipses,  inclined at all angles to the plane of the ecliptic. Indeed, several of  the orbits are actually those of known comets, and it is generally held  that these meteorites or \"shooting stars\" are the _debris_ that a comet  sheds on its journey.    We can never see the same \"shooting star\" twice; its visibility implies  its dissolution, for it is only as it is entrapped and burnt up in our  atmosphere that we see it, or can see it. Its companions in a great  meteoric swarm, are, however, as the sand on the sea-shore, and we  recognize them as members of the same swarm by their agreement in  direction and date. The swarms move in a closed orbit, and it is where  this orbit intersects that of the earth that we get a great \"star  shower,\" if both earth and swarm are present together at the  intersection. If the swarm is drawn out, so that many meteorites are  scattered throughout the whole circuit of its orbit, then we get a  \"shower\" every year. If the meteor swarm is more condensed, so as to  form a cluster, then the \"shower\" only comes when the \"gem of the ring,\"  as it is termed, is at the intersection of the orbits, and the earth is  there too.    Such a conjunction may present the most impressive spectacle that the  heavens can afford. The Leonid meteor shower is, perhaps, the most  famous. It has been seen at intervals of about thirty-three years, since  early in the tenth century. When Ibrahim ben Ahmed lay dying, in the  year 902 A.D., it was recorded that \"an infinite number of stars were  seen during the night, scattering themselves like rain to the right and  left, and that year was known as the year of stars.\" When the earth  encountered the same system in 1202 A.D. the Mohammedan record runs that  \"on the night of Saturday, on the last day of Muharram, stars shot  hither and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28540"],[0,"Bibliomania; or Book-Madness (#18)"],[1,"i. p. 109.         \"Our nation,\" says Mr. Bridgman, \"has been too inattentive       to bibliographical criticisms and enquiries; for generally       the English reader is obliged to resort to foreign writers       to satisfy his mind as to the value of authors. It behoves       us to consider that there is not a more useful or a more       desirable branch of education than a _knowledge of books_;       which being correctly ascertained and judiciously exercised,       will prove the touch-stone of intrinsic merit, and have the       effect of saving many spotless pages from prostitution.\"       _Legal Bibliography_, p. v. vi.]         [Footnote 73: Peignot, in his _Dictionnaire de Bibliologie_,       vol. i. 50, has given a very pompous account of what ought       to be the talents and duties of a Bibliographer. It would be       difficult indeed to find such things united in one person!       De Bure, in the eighth volume of his _Bibliographie       Instructive_, has prefixed a \"Discourse upon the Science of       Bibliography and the duties of a Bibliographer\" which is       worth consulting: but I know of nothing which better       describes, in few words, such a character, than the       following: \"In eo sit multijuga materiarum librorumque       notitia, ut saltem potiores eligat et inquirat: fida et       sedula apud exteras gentes procuratio, ut eos arcessat;       summa patientia ut rare venalis expectet: peculium semper       praesens et paratum, ne, si quando occurrunt, emendi occasio       intercidat; prudens denique auri argentique contemptus, ut       pecuniis sponte careat quae in bibliothecam formandam et       nutriendam sunt insumendae. Si forte vir literatus eo       felicitatis pervenit ut talem thesaurum coaceraverit, nec       solus illo invidios fruatur, sed usum cum eruditis qui       vigilias suas utilitati publicae devoverunt, liberaliter       communicet; &c.\"--_Bibliotheca Hulsiana_, vol. i. Praefat. p.       3, 4.]    Thus briefly and guardedly have I thrown out a few suggestions, which  may enable us to avoid, or mitigate the severity of, the disease  called THE BIBLIOMANIA. Happy indeed shall I deem myself, if, in the  description of its symptoms, and in the recommendation of the means of  cure, I may have snatched any one from a premature grave, or lightened  the load of years that are yet to cone [Transcriber's Note: come]!    You, my dear Sir, who, in your observations upon society, as well as  in your knowledge of ancient times, must have met with numerous  instances of the miseries which \"flesh is heir to,\" may be disposed  perhaps to confess that, of all species of afflictions, _the present  one_ under consideration has the least moral turpitude attached to it.  True, it may be so: for, in the examples which have been adduced,  there will be found neither Suicides, nor Gamesters, nor Profligates.  No woman's heart has been broken from midnight debaucheries: no  marriage vow has been violated: no child has been compelled to pine in  poverty or neglect: no patrimony has been wasted, and no ancestor's  fame tarnished! If men have erred under the influence of this disease,  their aberrations have been marked with an excess arising from  intellectual fevour, and not from a desire of baser gratifications.    If, therefore, in the wide survey which a philosopher may take of the  \"Miseries of Human life\"[74] the prevalence of this disorder may  appear to be less mischievous than that of others, and, if some of the  most amiable and learned of mortals seemed to have been both  unwilling, as well as unable, to avoid its contagion, you will  probably feel the less alarmed if symptoms of it should appear within  the sequestered abode of Hodnet![75] Recollecting that even in remoter  situations its influence has been felt--and that neither the pure  atmosphere of Hafod nor of Sledmere[76] has completely subdued its  power--you will be disposed to exclaim with violence, at the intrusion  of Bibliomaniacs--         What walls can guard me, or what shades can hide?       They pierce my thickets, through my grot they glide!       By land, by water, they renew the charge,       They stop the chariot, and they board the barge.[77]         [Footnote 74: In the ingenious and witty work so entitled, I       do not recollect whether the disappointment arising from a       _cropt_ or a _dirty_ copy has been classed among \"_The       Miseries of Human Life_.\"]         [Footnote 75: _Hodnet Hall_, Shropshire. The country       residence of Mr. Heber.]         [Footnote 76: _Hafod_, South Wales, the seat of THOS.       JOHNES, Esq., M.P., the translator of the Chronicles of       Froissart and Monstrelet, and of the Travels of De Broquiere       and Joinville. The conflagration of part of his mansion and       library, two years ago, which excited such a general       sympathy, would have damped any ardour of collection but       that of Mr. Johnes--his Library has arisen, Phoenix-like,       from the flames!         _Sledmere_, in Yorkshire, the seat of SIR MARK MASTERMAN       SYKES, Bart., M.P.

It is at       once copious and choice.]         [Footnote 77: Pope's \"_Prologue to the Satires_,\" v. 7-10.]    Upon the whole, therefore, attending closely to the symptoms of this  disorder as they have been described, and practising such means of  cure as have been recommended, we may rationally hope that its  virulence may abate, and the number of its victims annually diminish.  But if the more discerning part of the community anticipate a  different result, and the preceding observations appear to have  presented but a narrow and partial view of the mischiefs of the  BIBLIOMANIA, my only consolation is that to advance _something_ upon  the subject is better than to preserve a sullen and invincible  silence. Let it be the task of more experienced bibliographers to  correct and amplify the foregoing outline!    Believe me, My dear Sir,    Very sincerely Yours, &c.

It was on a fine autumnal evening, when the sun was setting serenely  behind a thick copse upon a distant hill, and his warm tints were  lighting up a magnificent and widely-extended landscape, that,  sauntering 'midst the fields, I was meditating upon the various  methods of honourably filling up the measure of our existence; when I  discovered, towards my left, a messenger running at full speed towards  me. The abruptness of his appearance, and the velocity of his step,  somewhat disconcerted me; but on his near approach my apprehensions  were dissipated.    I knew him to be the servant of my old college friend, whom I chuse  here to denominate LYSANDER. He came to inform me, in his blunt and  honest manner, that his master had just arrived with PHILEMON, our  common friend; and that, as they were too fatigued with their journey  to come out to me, they begged I would quickly enter the house, and,  as usual, make them welcome. This intelligence afforded me the  liveliest satisfaction. In fifteen minutes, after a hearty shaking of  hands, I was seated with them in the parlour; all of us admiring the  unusual splendour of the evening sky, and, in consequence, partaking  of the common topics of conversation with a greater flow of spirits.    \"You are come, my friends,\" said I (in the course of conversation),  \"to make some stay with me--indeed, I cannot suffer you to depart  without keeping you at least a week; in order, amongst other things,  to view the beauty of our neighbour Lorenzo's grounds, the general  splendour of his house, and the magnificence of his LIBRARY.\" \"In  regard to grounds and furniture,\" replied Lysander, \"there is very  little in the most beautiful and costly which can long excite my  attention--but the LIBRARY--\" \"Here,\" exclaimed Philemon, \"here you  have him in the toils.\" \"I will"]]]
