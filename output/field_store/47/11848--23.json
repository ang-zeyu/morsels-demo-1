Dorrie,  darling, what if it should be a--a--present of some sort or other!\"    \"I suppose it can't be anything else,\" smiled Doris. She knew that  Penelope had started out to say \"a new dress.\" She cut the strings  and removed the wrappings. Both girls stared.    \"Is it--it isn't--yes, it is! Doris Hunter, I believe it's an old  quilt!\"    Doris unfolded the odd present with a queer feeling of disappointment.  She did not know just what she had expected the package to contain,  but certainly not this. She laughed a little shakily.    \"Well, we can't say after this that Aunt Adella never gave us  anything,\" she said, when she had opened her letter. \"Listen,  Penelope.\"        _My Dear Doris_:        _I have decided to give up housekeeping and go out West to      live with Robert. So I am disposing of such of the family      heirlooms as I do not wish to take with me. I am sending you      by express your Grandmother Hunter's silk quilt. It is a      handsome article still and I hope you will prize it as you      should. It took your grandmother five years to make it. There      is a bit of the wedding dress of every member of the family in      it. Love to Penelope and yourself._                              _Your affectionate aunt,                                      Adella Hunter._    \"I don't see its beauty,\" said Penelope with a grimace. \"It may have  been pretty once, but it is all faded now. It is a monument of  patience, though. The pattern is what they call 'Little Thousands,'  isn't it? Tell me, Dorrie, does it argue a lack of proper respect for  my ancestors that I can't feel very enthusiastic over this  heirloom--especially when Grandmother Hunter died years before I was  born?\"    \"It was very kind of Aunt Adella to send it,\" said Doris dutifully.    \"Oh, very,\" agreed Penelope drolly. \"Only don't ever ask me to sleep  under it. It would give me the nightmare. O-o-h!\"    This last was a little squeal of admiration as Doris turned the quilt  over and brought to view the shimmering lining.    \"Why, the wrong side is ever so much prettier than the right!\"  exclaimed Penelope. \"What lovely, old-timey stuff! And not a bit  faded.\"    The lining was certainly very pretty. It was a soft, creamy yellow  silk, with a design of brocaded pink rosebuds all over it.    \"That was a dress Grandmother Hunter had when she was a girl,\" said  Doris absently. \"I remember hearing Aunt Adella speak of it. When it  became old-fashioned, Grandmother used it to line her quilt. I  declare, it is as good as new.\"    \"Well, let us go and have tea,\" said Penelope. \"I'm decidedly hungry.  Besides, I see the poverty pucker coming. Put the quilt in the spare  room. It is something to possess an heirloom, after all. It gives one  a nice, important-family feeling.\"    After tea, when Penelope was patiently grinding away at her studies  and thinking dolefully enough of the near-approaching examinations,  which she dreaded, and of teaching, which she confidently expected to  hate, Doris went up to the tiny spare room to look at the wrong side  of the quilt again.    \"It would make the loveliest party waist,\" she said under her breath.  \"Creamy yellow is Penelope's colour, and I could use that bit of old  black lace and those knots of velvet ribbon that I have to trim it. I  wonder if Grandmother Hunter's reproachful spirit will forever haunt  me if I do it.\"    Doris knew very well that she would do it--had known it ever since  she had looked at that lovely lining and a vision of Penelope's vivid  face and red-brown hair rising above a waist of the quaint old silk  had flashed before her mental sight. That night, after Penelope had  gone to bed, Doris ripped the lining out of Grandmother Hunter's silk  quilt.    \"If Aunt Adella saw me now!\" she laughed softly to herself as she  worked.    In the three following evenings Doris made the waist. She thought it a  wonderful bit of good luck that Penelope went out each of the evenings  to study some especially difficult problems with a school chum.    \"It will be such a nice surprise for her,\" the sister mused  jubilantly.    Penelope was surprised as much as the tender, sisterly heart could  wish when Doris flashed out upon her triumphantly on the evening of  the party with the black skirt nicely pressed and re-hung, and the  prettiest waist imaginable--a waist that was a positive \"creation\" of  dainty rose-besprinkled silk, with a girdle and knots of black velvet.    \"Doris Hunter, you are a veritable little witch! Do you mean to tell  me that you conjured that perfectly lovely thing for me out of the  lining of Grandmother Hunter's quilt?\"    So Penelope went to Blanche's party and her dress was the admiration  of every girl there. Mrs. Fairweather, who was visiting Mrs. Anderson,  looked closely at it also. She was a very sweet old lady, with silver  hair, which she wore in delightful, old-fashioned puffs, and she had  very bright, dark eyes. Penelope thought her altogether charming.    \"She looks as if she had just stepped out of the frame of some lovely  old picture,\" she said to herself. \"I wish she belonged to me. I'd  just love to have a grandmother like her. And I do wonder who it is  I've seen who looks so much like her.\"    A little later on the knowledge came to her suddenly, and she thought  with inward surprise: Why, it is Doris, of course. If my sister Doris  lives to be seventy years old and wears her hair in pretty white  puffs, she will look exactly as Mrs. Fairweather does now.    Mrs. Fairweather asked to have Penelope introduced to her, and when  they found themselves alone together she said gently, \"My dear, I am  going to ask a very impertinent question. Will you tell me where you  got the silk of which your waist is made?\"    Poor Penelope's pretty young face turned crimson. She was not troubled  with false pride by any means, but she simply could not bring herself  to tell Mrs. Fairweather that her waist was made out of the lining of  an old heirloom quilt.    \"My Aunt Adella gave me--gave us--the material,\" she stammered. \"And  my elder sister Doris made the waist for me. I think the silk once  belonged to my Grandmother Hunter.\"    \"What was your grandmother's maiden name?\" asked Mrs. Fairweather  eagerly.    \"Penelope Saverne. I am named after her.\"    Mrs. Fairweather suddenly put her arm about Penelope and drew the  young girl to her, her lovely old face aglow with delight and  tenderness.    \"Then you are my grandniece,\" she said. \"Your grandmother was my  half-sister. When I saw your dress, I felt sure you were related to  her. I should recognize that rosebud silk if I came across it in  Thibet. Penelope Saverne was the daughter of my mother by her first  husband. Penelope was four years older than I was, but we were  devoted to each other. Oddly enough, our birthdays fell on the same  day, and when Penelope was twenty and I sixteen, my father gave us  each a silk dress of this very material. I have mine yet.    \"Soon after this our mother died and our household was broken up.  Penelope went to live with her aunt and I went West with Father. This  was long ago, you know, when travelling and correspondence were not  the easy, matter-of-course things they are now. After a few years I  lost touch with my half-sister. I married out West and have lived  there all my life. I never knew what had become of Penelope. But  tonight, when I saw you come in in that waist made of the rosebud  silk, the whole past rose before me and I felt like a girl again. My  dear, I am a very lonely old woman, with nobody belonging to me. You  don't know how delighted I am to find that I have two grandnieces.\"    Penelope had listened silently, like a girl in a dream. Now she patted  Mrs. Fairweather's soft old hand affectionately.    \"It sounds like a storybook,\" she said gaily. \"You must come and see  Doris. She is such a darling sister. I wouldn't have had this waist if  it hadn't been for her. I will tell you the whole truth--I don't mind  it now. Doris made my party waist for me out of the lining of an old  silk quilt of Grandmother Hunter's that Aunt Adella sent us.\"    Mrs. Fairweather did go to see Doris the very next day, and quite  wonderful things came to pass from that interview. Doris and Penelope  found their lives and plans changed in the twinkling of an eye. They  were both to go and live with Aunt Esther--as Mrs. Fairweather had  said they must call her. Penelope was to have, at last, her longed-for  musical education and Doris was to be the home girl.    \"You must take the place of my own dear little granddaughter,\" said  Aunt Esther. \"She died six years ago, and I have been so lonely  since.\"    When Mrs. Fairweather had gone, Doris and Penelope looked at each  other.    \"Pinch me, please,\" said Penelope. \"I'm half afraid I'll wake up and  find I have been dreaming. Isn't it all wonderful, Doris Hunter?\"    Doris nodded radiantly.    \"Oh, Penelope, think of it! Music for you--somebody to pet and fuss  over for me--and such a dear, sweet aunty for us both!\"    \"And no more contriving party waists out of old silk linings,\" laughed  Penelope. \"But it was very fortunate that you did it for once, sister  mine. And no more poverty puckers,\" she concluded.          The Girl and The Wild Race      \"If Judith would only get married,\" Mrs. Theodora Whitney was wont to  sigh dolorously.    Now, there was no valid reason why Judith ought to get married unless  she wanted to. But Judith was twenty-seven and Mrs. Theodora thought  it was a terrible disgrace to be an old maid.    \"There has never been an old maid in our family so far back as we know  of,\" she lamented. \"And to think that there should be one now! It just  drags us down to the level of the McGregors. They have always been  noted for their old maids.\"    Judith took all her aunt's lamentations good-naturedly."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24876"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1905 to 1906 (#18)"],[1,"celebration up until twelve to welcome the new year  in, and then they bade Ida good night. But Miss Monroe lingered for a  moment behind the others to say softly:    \"I want to tell you how good and sweet I think it was of you to give  up your cake to the other Ida. That little bit of unselfishness was a  good guerdon for your new year.\"    And Ida, radiant-faced at this praise from her idol, answered  heartily:    \"I'm afraid I'm anything but unselfish, Miss Monroe. But I mean to try  to be more this coming year and think a little about the girls outside  of my own little set who may be lonely or discouraged. The other Ida  Mitchell isn't going to have to depend on that fruit cake alone for  comfort and encouragement for the next twelve months.\"          In the Old Valley      The man halted on the crest of the hill and looked sombrely down into  the long valley below. It was evening, and although the hills around  him were still in the light the valley was already filled with kindly,  placid shadows. A wind that blew across it from the misty blue sea  beyond was making wild music in the rugged firs above his head as he  stood in an angle of the weather-grey longer fence, knee-deep in  bracken. It had been by these firs he had halted twenty years ago,  turning for one last glance at the valley below, the home valley which  he had never seen since. But then the firs had been little more than  vigorous young saplings; they were tall, gnarled trees now, with  lichened trunks, and their lower boughs were dead. But high up their  tops were green and caught the saffron light of the west. He  remembered that when a boy he had thought there was nothing more  beautiful than the evening sunshine falling athwart the dark green fir  boughs on the hills.    As he listened to the swish and murmur of the wind, the earth-old tune  with the power to carry the soul back to the dawn of time, the years  fell away from him and he forgot much, remembering more. He knew now  that there had always been a longing in his heart to hear the  wind-chant in the firs. He had called that longing by other names, but  he knew it now for what it was when, hearing, he was satisfied.    He was a tall man with iron-grey hair and the face of a  conqueror--strong, pitiless, unswerving. Eagle eyes, quick to discern  and unfaltering to pursue; jaw square and intrepid; mouth formed to  keep secrets and cajole men to his will--a face that hid much and  revealed little. It told of power and intellect, but the soul of the  man was a hidden thing. Not in the arena where he had fought and  triumphed, giving fierce blow for blow, was it to be shown; but here,  looking down on the homeland, with the strength of the hills about  him, it rose dominantly and claimed its own. The old bond held. Yonder  below him was home--the old house that had sheltered him, the graves  of his kin, the wide fields where his boyhood dreams had been dreamed.    Should he go down to it? This was the question he asked himself. He  had come back to it, heartsick of his idols of the marketplace. For  years they had satisfied him, the buying and selling and getting gain,  the pitting of strength and craft against strength and craft, the  tireless struggle, the exultation of victory. Then, suddenly, they had  failed their worshipper; they ceased to satisfy; the sacrifices he had  heaped on their altars availed him nothing in this new need and hunger  of his being. His gods mocked him and he wearied of their service.  Were there not better things than these, things he had once known and  loved and forgotten? Where were the ideals of his youth, the lofty  aspirations that had upborne him then? Where was the eagerness and  zest of new dawns, the earnestness of well-filled, purposeful hours of  labour, the satisfaction of a good day worthily lived, at eventide the  unbroken rest of long, starry nights? Where might he find them again?  Were they yet to be had for the seeking in the old valley? With the  thought came a great yearning for home. He had had many habitations,  but he realized now that he had never thought of any of these places  as home. That name had all unconsciously been kept sacred to the long,  green, seaward-looking glen where he had been born.    So he had come back to it, drawn by a longing not to be resisted. But  at the last he felt afraid. There had been many changes, of that he  felt sure. Would it still be home? And if not, would not the loss be  most irreparable and bitter? Would it not be better to go away, having  looked at it from the hill and having heard the saga of the firs,  keeping his memory of it unblurred, than risk the probable disillusion  of a return to the places that had forgotten him and friends whom the  varying years must certainly have changed as he had changed himself?  No, he would not go down. It had been a foolish whim to come at  all--foolish, because the object of his quest was not to be found  there or elsewhere. He could not enter again into the heritage of  boyhood and the heart of youth. He could not find there the old dreams  and hopes that had made life sweet. He understood that he could not  bring back to the old valley what he had taken from it. He had lost  that intangible, all-real wealth of faith and idealism and zest; he  had bartered it away for the hard, yellow gold of the marketplace, and  he realized at last how much poorer he was than when he had left that  home valley. His was a name that stood for millions, but he was  beggared of hope and purpose.    No, he would not go down. There was no one left there, unchanged and  unchanging, to welcome him. He would be a stranger there, even among  his kin. He would stay awhile on the hill, until the night came down  over it, and then he would go back to his own place.    Down below him, on the crest of a little upland, he saw his old home,  a weather-grey house, almost hidden among white birch and apple trees,  with a thick fir grove to the north of it. He had been born in that  old house; his earliest memory was of standing on its threshold and  looking afar up to the long green hills.    \"What is over the hills?\" he had asked of his mother. With a smile she  had made answer,    \"Many things, laddie. Wonderful things, beautiful things,  heart-breaking things.\"    \"Some day I shall go over the hills and find them all, Mother,\" he had  said stoutly.    She had laughed and sighed and caught him to her heart. He had no  recollection of his father, who had died soon after his son's birth,  but how well he remembered his mother, his little, brown-eyed,  girlish-faced mother!    He had lived on the homestead until he was twenty. He had tilled the  broad fields and gone in and out among the people, and their life had  been his life. But his heart was not in his work. He wanted to go  beyond the hills and seek what he knew must be there. The valley was  too narrow, too placid. He longed for conflict and accomplishment. He  felt power and desire and the lust of endeavour stirring in him. Oh,  to go over the hills to a world where men lived! Such had been the  goal of all his dreams.    When his mother died he sold the farm to his cousin, Stephen Marshall.  He supposed it still belonged to him. Stephen had been a good sort of  a fellow, a bit slow and plodding, perhaps, bovinely content to dwell  within the hills, never hearkening or responding to the lure of the  beyond. Yet it might be he had chosen the better part, to dwell thus  on the land of his fathers, with a wife won in youth, and children to  grow up around him. The childless, wifeless man looking down from the  hill wondered if it might have been so with him had he been content to  stay in the valley. Perhaps so. There had been Joyce.    He wondered where Joyce was now and whom she had married, for of  course she had married. Did she too live somewhere down there in the  valley, the matronly, contented mother of lads and lassies? He could  see her old home also, not so far from his own, just across a green  meadow by way of a footpath and stile and through the firs beyond it.  How often he had traversed that path in the old days, knowing that  Joyce would be waiting at the end of it among the firs--Joyce, the  playmate of childhood, the sweet confidante and companion of youth!  They had never been avowed lovers, but he had loved her then, as a boy  loves, although he had never said a word of love to her. Joyce alone  knew of his longings and his ambitions and his dreams; he had told  them all to her freely, sure of the understanding and sympathy no  other soul in the valley could give him. How true and strong and  womanly and gentle she had always been!    When he left home he had meant to go back to her some day. They had  parted without pledge or kiss, yet he knew she loved him and that he  loved her. At first they corresponded, then the letters began to grow  fewer. It was his fault; he had gradually forgotten. The new, fierce,  burning interests that came into his life crowded the old ones out.  Boyhood's love was scorched up in that hot flame of ambition and  contest. He had not heard from or of Joyce for many years. Now, again,  he remembered as he looked down on the homeland fields.    The old places had changed little, whatever he might fear of the  people who lived in them. There was the school he had attended, a  small, low-eaved, white-washed building set back from the main road  among green spruces. Beyond it, amid tall elms, was the old church  with its square tower hung with ivy. He felt glad to see it; he had  expected to see a new church, offensively spick-and-span and modern,  for this church had been old when he was a boy. He recalled the many  times he had walked to it on the peaceful Sunday afternoons, sometimes  with his mother, sometimes with Joyce.    The sun set far out to sea and sucked down with it all the light out  of the winnowed dome of sky. The stars came out singly and crystal  clear over"]]]
