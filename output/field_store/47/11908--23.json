[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27995"],[0,"The History of London (#18)"],[1,"is found in Persia and in Denmark, and I dare say  all over the world. Yet I believe in its literal truth.    In the year 1378 Whittington's name first appears in the City papers. He  was then perhaps twenty-one--but the date of his birth is uncertain--and  was already in trade, not, as yet, very far advanced, for his assessment  shows that as yet he was in the lowest and poorest class of the  wholesale Mercers.          31. WHITTINGTON.    PART II.      For nearly fifty years after this Whittington leads an active, busy,  prosperous life. It was a distracted time, full of troubles and  anxieties. A Charter obtained in 1376, two or three years before he  began business, was probably the real foundation of Whittington's  fortune. For it forbade foreign merchants to sell by retail. This meant  that a foreign ship bringing wine to the port of London could only  dispose of her merchandise to the wholesale vintners: or one bringing  silk could only sell it to wholesale mercers. The merchants, no doubt,  intended to use this Charter for the furtherance of their own shipping  interests.    This important Charter, presented by the King, was nearly lost a little  after, when there was trouble about Wycliffe. The great scholar was  ordered to appear at St. Paul's Cathedral before the Archbishop of  Canterbury and the Bishop of London, to answer charges of heresy. He  was not an unprotected and friendless man, and he appeared at the  Cathedral under the protection of the powerful John of Gaunt, Duke of  Lancaster, son of King Edward III. The Bishop of London rebuked the Duke  for protecting heretics, so the Duke, enraged, threatened to pull the  Bishop out of his own church by the hair of his head. The people outside  shouted that they would all die before the Bishop should suffer  indignity. John of Gaunt rode off to Westminster and proposed that the  office of Mayor should be abolished and that the Marshal of England  should hold his court in the City--in other words, that even the  liberties and Charters of the City should be swept clean away. Then the  Londoners rushed to the Savoy, the Duke's palace, and would have sacked  and destroyed it but for the Bishop. This story indicates the kind of  danger to which, in those ages, the City was liable. There were no  police; a popular tumult easily and suddenly became a rebellion: no one  knew what might happen when the folk met together and wild passions of  unreasoning fury were aroused.    Another danger of the time for the peaceful merchant. For some years the  navigation of the North Sea and the Channel was greatly impeded by a  Scottish privateer or pirate named Mercer. In vain had the City made  representations to the King. Nothing was done, and the pirate grew daily  stronger and bolder. Then Sir John Philpot, the Mayor, did a very  patriotic thing. He built certain ships of his own, equipped them with  arms, went on board as captain or admiral, and manned them with a  thousand stout fellows. He found the pirate off Scarborough, fell upon  him, slew him with all his men and returned to London Port with all his  own ships and all the pirate's ships--including fifteen Spanish vessels  which had joined Mercer.    The King pretended to be angry with this private mode of carrying on  war, but the thing was done, and it was a very good thing, and  profitable to London and to the King himself, therefore when Sir John  Philpot gave the King the arms and armour of a thousand men and all his  own ships and prize ships, the Royal clemency was not difficult to  obtain. I wish that I could state that Whittington had sailed with Sir  John on this gallant expedition.    A third trouble arose in the year 1381 on the rebellion of the peasants  under John Ball, Wat Tyler, Jack the Miller, Jack the Carter, and Jack  Trewman. The rebels held possession of the City for awhile. They  destroyed the Savoy, the Temple and the houses of the foreign merchants  (this shows that they had been joined by some of the London people).  They murdered the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Prior of St. John's  Hospital. Then the citizens roused themselves and with an army of 6,000  men stood in ranks to defend the King.    Then there happened the troubles of John of Northampton, Mayor in 1382.  You have learned how trades of all kinds were banded together each in  its own Company. Every Company had the right of regulating prices. Thus  the Fishmongers sold their fish at a price ordered by the Warden or  Master of the Company. It is easy to understand that this might lead to  murmurs against the high price of fish or of anything else. This, in  fact, really happened. It was a time of great questioning and doubt; the  rising of Wat Tyler shows that this spirit was abroad. The craftsmen of  London, those who made things, grumbled loudly at the price of  provisions. They asked why the City should not take over the trade in  food of all kinds and sell it to the people at lower prices. John of  Northampton being Mayor, took the popular view. He did not exactly make  over the provisioning of the City to the Corporation, but he first  obtained an Act of Parliament throwing open the calling of fishmonger to  all comers; and then another which practically abolished the trade of  grocers, pepperers, fruiterers, butchers, and bakers. Imagine the rage  with which such an Act would now be received by London tradesmen!    The next Mayor, however, obtained the rescinding of these Acts. In  consequence, fish went up in price and there was a popular tumult, upon  which one man was hanged and John of Northampton was sent to the Castle  of Tintagel on the Cornish Coast, where he remained for the rest of his  life.          32. WHITTINGTON.    PART III.      In the year 1384, being then about twenty-six years of age, Whittington  was elected a member of the Common Council. In the year 1389 he was  assessed at the same sum as the richest citizen. So that these ten years  of his life were evidently very prosperous. In the year 1393 he was made  Alderman for Broad Street Ward. In the same year he was made Sheriff. In  the year 1396, the Mayor, Adam Bamme, dying in office, Whittington  succeeded him. The following year he was elected Mayor.    In the year 1401, water was brought from Tyburn (now the N.E. corner of  Hyde Park) to Cornhill in pipes, a great and important boon to the City.    In the year 1406 he was again elected Mayor. The manner of his election  is described in the contemporary records. After service in the chapel  of the Guildhall, the outgoing Mayor, with all the Aldermen and as many  as possible of the wealthier and more substantial Commoners of the City,  met in the Guildhall and chose two of their number, viz., Richard  Whittington and Drew Barentyn. Then the Mayor receiving this nomination  retired into a closed chamber with the Aldermen and made choice of  Whittington.    In the year 1419 he was elected Mayor for the third and last time, but,  counting his succession to Bamme, he was actually four times Mayor. In  1416 he was returned Member of Parliament for the City.    It was not a new thing for a citizen to be made Mayor more than once.  Three during the reign of Edward III. were Mayor four times; two, three  times; seven, twice.    In Whittington's later years began the burning of heretics and Lollards.  It is certain that Lollardism had some hold in the City, but one knows  not how great was the hold. A priest, William Sawtre, was the first who  suffered. Two men of the lower class followed. There is nothing to show  that Whittington ever swerved from orthodox opinions.    In 1416, the City was first lighted at night: all citizens were ordered  to hang lanterns over their doors. How far the order was obeyed,  especially in the poorer parts of the City, is not known.    In 1407 a plague carried off 30,000 persons in London alone. If this  number is correctly stated it must have taken half the population.    Many improvements were effected in the City during these years: it is  reasonable to suppose that Whittington had a hand in bringing these  about. Fresh water brought in pipes: lights hung out after dark: the  erection of a house--Bakewell Hall--for the storage and sale of  broadcloth: the erection of a store for the reception of grain, in case  of famine--this was the beginning of Leadenhall--the building of a new  Guildhall: and an attempt to reform the prisons--an attempt which  failed.    In his last year of office Whittington entertained the King, Henry V.  and his Queen.    There was as yet no Mansion House: every Mayor made use of his own  private house.    The magnificence of the entertainment amazed the King. Even the fires  were fed with cedar and perfumed wood. When the Queen spoke of this  costly gift the Mayor proposed to feed the fire with something more  precious still. He then produced the King's bonds to the value of  60,000_l._ which he threw into the fire and burned. This great sum would  be a very considerable gift even now. In that time it represented at  least six times its present value. The Mayor therefore gave the King the  sum of 360,000_l._    This is, very shortly, an account of Whittington's public life.    He lived, I believe, on the north side of St. Michael's Paternoster  Royal. I think so because his College was established there after his  death, and as he had no children it is reasonable to suppose that his  house would be assigned to the College. There is nothing to show what  kind of house it was, but we may rest assured that the man who could  entertain the King and Queen in such a manner was at least well housed.  There is a little court on this spot which is, I believe, on the site of  Whittington's house. They used to show a house in Hart Street as  Whittington's, but there was no ground for the tradition except that it  was a very old house.    Whittington married his master's daughter, Alice Fitzwarren. He had no  children, and he died in 1423 when he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2800"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#18)"],[1,"postor, an insolent person.\"    To-morrow shall they learn who is the impostor, the insolent.    \"For we will send the she-camel to prove them: do thou mark them well, O  Saleh, and be patient:    And foretell them that their waters shall1 be divided between themselves and  her, and that every draught shall come by turns to them.\"    But they called to their comrade, and he took a knife and ham-strung her.    And how great was my vengeance and my menance!    We sent against them a single shout; and they became like the dry sticks of  the fold-builders.    Easy have we made the Koran for warning-but, is there any one who receives  the warning?    The people of Lot treated his warning as a lie;    But we sent a stone-charged wind against them all, except the family of Lot,  whom at daybreak we delivered,    By our special grace-for thus we reward the thankful.    He, indeed, had warned them of our severity, but of that warning they  doubted.    Even this guess did they demand: therefore we deprived them of sight,    And said, \"Taste ye my vengeance and my menace;\"    And in the morning a relentless punishment overtook them.    Easy have we made the Koran for warning but, is there any one who receives  the warning?    To the people of Pharaoh also came the threatenings:    All our miracles did they treat as impostures. Therefore seized we them as he  only can seize, who is the Mighty, the Strong.    Are your infidels, O Meccans, better men than these? Is there an exemption  for you in the sacred Books?    Will they say, \"We are a host that lend one another aid?\"    The host shall be routed, and they shall turn them back.    But, that Hour is their threatened time, and that Hour shall be most severe  and bitter.    Verily, the wicked are sunk in bewilderment and folly.    On that day they shall be dragged into the fire on their faces. \"Taste ye the  touch of Hell.\"    All things have we created after a fixed decree:    Our command was but one word, swift as the twinkling of an eye.    Of old, too, have we destroyed the like of you-yet is any one warned?    And everything that they do is in the Books;2    Each action, both small and great, is written down.    Verily, amid gardens3 and rivers shall the pious dwell.    In the seat of truth, in the presence of the potent King.      _______________________    1 See Sura [lvi.] xxvi. 155; also Sura [lxxxvii.] vii. 71.    2 Kept by the Guardian Angels.    3 The Talmudic descriptions of the Gardens-for the later Jews believed in  more than one Paradise-and of the rivers and trees therein, will be found in  Schr der Talm. Rabb. Judenthum, pp. 418-432.      SURA XXXVII.-THE RANKS [L.]    MECCA.-182 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    By the angels ranged in order for Songs of Praise,    And by those who repel demons,1    And by those who recite the Koran for warning,    Truly your God is but one,    Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth, and of all that is between them, and  Lord of the East.2    We have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the stars.    They serve also as a guard against every rebellious Satan,    That they overhear not what passeth in the assembly on high, for they are  darted at from every side,3    Driven off and consigned to a lasting torment;    While, if one steal a word by stealth, a glistening flame pursueth him.    Ask the Meccans then, Are they, or the angels whom we have made, the stronger  creation? Aye, of coarse clay have we created them.    But while thou marvellest they mock;    When they are warned, no warning do they take;    And when they see a sign, they fall to mocking,    And say, \"This is no other than clear sorcery:    What! when dead, and turned to dust and bones, shall we indeed be raised?    Our sires also of olden times?\"    Say, Yes; and ye shall be covered with disgrace.    For, one blast only, and lo! they shall gaze around them, And shall say, \"Oh!  woe to us! this is the day of reckoning; This is the day of decision which ye  gainsaid as an untruth.\"    Gather together those who have acted unjustly, and their consorts,4 and the  gods whom they adored    Beside God; and guide them to the road for Hell.    Set them forth: they shall be questioned.    \"How now, that ye help not one another?\"    But on this day they shall submit themselves to God,    And shall address one another with mutual reproaches.    They shall say, \"In sooth, ye came to us in well-omened sort:\"5    But they will answer, \"Nay, it was ye who would not believe; and we had no  power whatever over you. Nay, ye were people given to transgress;    Just, therefore, is the doom which our Lord hath passed upon us.6 We shall  surely taste it:    We made you err, for we had erred ourselves.\"    Partners therefore shall they be in punishment on that day.    Truly, thus will we deal with the wicked,    Because when it was said to them, There is no God but God, they swelled with  pride,    And said, \"Shall we then abandon our gods for a crazed poet?\"    Nay, he cometh with truth and confirmeth the Sent Ones of old.    Ye shall surely taste the painful punishment,    And ye shall not be rewarded but as ye have wrought,    Save the sincere servants of God!    A stated banquet shall they have    Of fruits; and honoured shall they be    In the gardens of delight,    Upon couches face to face.    A cup shall be borne round among them from a fountain,    Limpid, delicious to those who drink;    It shall not oppress the sense, nor shall they therewith be drunken.    And with them are the large-eyed ones with modest refraining glances, fair  like the sheltered egg.7    And they shall address one another with mutual questions.    Saith one of them, \"I truly had a bosom friend,    Who said, 'Art thou of those who credit it?    What! when we shall have died, and become dust and bones, shall we indeed be  judged?\"'    He shall say to those around him, \"Will ye look?\"    And he shall look and see him in the midst of Hell.    And he shall say to him, \"By God, thou hadst almost caused me to perish;    And, but for the favour of my Lord, I had surely been of those who have been  brought with thee into torment.\"    \"But do we not die,\" say the blessed,    \"Any other than our first death? and have we escaped the torment?\"8    This truly is the great felicity!    For the like of this should the travailers travail!    Is this the better repast or the tree Ez-zakkoum?    Verily, we have made it for a subject of discord to the wicked.    It is a tree which cometh up from the bottom of hell;    Its fruits is as it were the heads of Satans;    And, lo! the damned shall surely eat of it and fill their bellies with it:    Then shall they have, thereon, a mixture of boiling water:    Then shall they return to hell.    They found their fathers erring,    And they hastened on in their footsteps.    Also before them the greater number of the ancients had erred.    Though we had sent warners among them.    But see what was the end of these warned ones,    Except of God's true servants.    Noah called on us of old, and right prompt were we to hear him,9    And we saved him and his family out of the great distress,    And we made his offspring the survivors;    And we left for him with posterity,    \"Peace be on Noah throughout the worlds!\"    Thus do we reward the well-doers,    For he was one of our believing servants;-    And the rest we drowned.    And truly, of his faith was Abraham,    When he brought to his Lord a perfect heart,    When he said to his father and to his people, \"What is this ye worship?    Prefer ye with falsehood gods to God?    And what deem ye of the Lord of the worlds?\"    So gazing he gazed towards the stars,    And said, \"In sooth I am ill:10    And they turned their back on him and departed.    He went aside to their gods and said, \"Do ye not eat?    What aileth you that ye do not speak?\"    He broke out upon them, with the right hand striking:    When his tribesmen came back to him with hasty steps    He said, \"Worship ye what ye carve,    When God hath created you, and that ye make?\"    They said, \"Build up a pyre for him and cast him into the glowing flame.\"    Fain would they plot against him, but we brought them low.    And he said, \"Verily, I repair to my Lord who will guide me:    O Lord give me a son, of the righteous.\"    We announced to him a youth of meekness.    And when he became a full-grown youth,11    His father said to him, \"My son, I have seen in a dream that I should  sacrifice thee; therefore, consider what thou seest right.\"    He said, \"My father, do what thou art bidden; of the patient, if    God please, shalt thou find me.\"    And when they had surrendered them to the will of God, he laid him down upon  his forehead:    We cried unto him, \"O Abraham!    Now hast thou satisfied the vision.\" See how we recompense the righteous.    This was indeed a decisive test.    And we ransomed his son with a costly12 victim,    And we left this13 for him among posterity,    \"PEACE BE ON ABRAHAM!\"    Thus do we reward the well-doers,    For he was of our believing servants.    And we announced Isaac to him-a righteous Prophet-    And on him and on Isaac we bestowed our blessing. And among their offspring  were well-doers, and others, to their own hurt undoubted sinners.    And of old,14 to Moses and to Aaron shewed we favours:    And both of them, and their people, we rescued from the great distress:    And we succoured them, and they became the conquerors:    And we gave them (Moses and Aaron) each the lucid book:    And we guided them each into the right way:    And we left this for each among posterity,    \"PEACE BE ON MOSES AND AARON.\"    Thus do we reward the well-doers,    For they were two of our believing servants.    And Elias truly was of our Sent Ones,    When he said to his people, \"Fear ye not God?    Invoke ye Baal and forsake ye the most skilful Creator?    God is your Lord, and the Lord of your sires of old?\""]]]
