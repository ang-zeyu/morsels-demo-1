and they took them wives of all which they chose.    01:006:003 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man,             for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred             and twenty years.    01:006:004 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after             that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men,             and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men             which were of old, men of renown.    01:006:005 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,             and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was             only evil continually.    01:006:006 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth,             and it grieved him at his heart.    01:006:007 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from             the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping             thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I             have made them.    01:006:008 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.    01:006:009 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and             perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.    01:006:010 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.    01:006:011 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was             filled with violence.    01:006:012 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt;             for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.    01:006:013 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before             me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and,             behold, I will destroy them with the earth.    01:006:014 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the             ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.    01:006:015 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The             length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth             of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.    01:006:016 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou             finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the             side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou             make it.    01:006:017 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the             earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life,             from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall             die.    01:006:018 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt             come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy             sons' wives with thee.    01:006:019 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort             shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee;             they shall be male and female.    01:006:020 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of             every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every             sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.    01:006:021 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou             shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee,             and for them.    01:006:022 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did             he.    01:007:001 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into             the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this             generation.    01:007:002 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the             male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two,             the male and his female.    01:007:003 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female;             to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.    01:007:004 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth             forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I             have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.    01:007:005 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.    01:007:006 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters             was upon the earth.    01:007:007 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'             wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the             flood.    01:007:008 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of             fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,    01:007:009 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and             the female, as God had commanded Noah.    01:007:010 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the             flood were upon the earth.    01:007:011 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,             the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the             fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of             heaven were opened.    01:007:012 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.    01:007:013 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and             Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three             wives of his sons with them, into the ark;    01:007:014 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after             their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the             earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every             bird of every sort.    01:007:015 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all             flesh, wherein is the breath of life.    01:007:016 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh,             as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.    01:007:017 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters             increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the             earth.    01:007:018 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the             earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.    01:007:019 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all             the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were             covered.    01:007:020 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the             mountains were covered.    01:007:021 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl,             and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that             creepeth upon the earth, and every man:    01:007:022 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was             in the dry land, died.    01:007:023 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the             face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping             things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed             from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that             were with him in the ark.    01:007:024 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty             days.    01:008:001 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the             cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to             pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;    01:008:002 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were             stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;    01:008:003 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and             after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were             abated.    01:008:004 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth             day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.    01:008:005 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in             the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops             of the mountains seen.    01:008:006 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened             the window of the ark which he had made:    01:008:007 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until             the waters were dried up from off the earth.    01:008:008 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were             abated from off the face of the ground;    01:008:009 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she             returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the             face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took             her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8003"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 3: Leviticus (#3)"],[1,"hereon: for it is a sin offering.    03:005:012 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall             take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it             on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the             LORD: it is a sin offering.    03:005:013 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his             sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be             forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat             offering.    03:005:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:005:015 If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the             holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass             unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with             thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the             sanctuary, for a trespass offering.    03:005:016 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the             holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it             unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for             him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be             forgiven him.    03:005:017 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are             forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though             he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.    03:005:018 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock,             with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:             and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his             ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be             forgiven him.    03:005:019 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed             against the LORD.    03:006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:006:002 If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie             unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or             in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath             deceived his neighbour;

he shall even             restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more             thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the             day of his trespass offering.    03:006:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram             without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a             trespass offering, unto the priest:    03:006:007 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the             LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that             he hath done in trespassing therein.    03:006:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:006:009 Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the             burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the             burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the             fire of the altar shall be burning in it.    03:006:010 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen             breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes             which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the             altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.    03:006:011 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments,             and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.    03:006:012 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall             not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every             morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he             shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.    03:006:013 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never             go out.    03:006:014 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron             shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.    03:006:015 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat             offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense             which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the             altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the             LORD.    03:006:016 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with             unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the             court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.    03:006:017 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them             for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most             holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.    03:006:018 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It             shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the             offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth             them shall be holy.    03:006:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:006:020 This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they             shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the             tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering             perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at             night.    03:006:021 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou             shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering             shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.    03:006:022 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall             offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be             wholly burnt.    03:006:023 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt:             it shall not be eaten.    03:006:024 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:006:025 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of             the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is             killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is             most holy.    03:006:026 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy             place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the             congregation.    03:006:027 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and             when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment,             thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy             place.    03:006:028 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken:             and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured,             and rinsed in water.    03:006:029 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most             holy.    03:006:030 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into             the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the             holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.    03:007:001 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most             holy.    03:007:002 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they             kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he             sprinkle round about upon the altar.    03:007:003 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and             the fat that covereth the inwards,    03:007:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by             the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the             kidneys, it shall he take away:    03:007:005 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering             made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.    03:007:006 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be             eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.    03:007:007 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is             one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith             shall have it.    03:007:008 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even             the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt             offering which he hath offered.    03:007:009 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all             that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the             priest's that offereth it.    03:007:010 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all             the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.    03:007:011 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which             he shall offer unto the LORD.    03:007:012 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with             the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with             oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes             mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.    03:007:013 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened             bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace             offerings.    03:007:014 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an             heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's             that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.    03:007:015 And the "]]]
