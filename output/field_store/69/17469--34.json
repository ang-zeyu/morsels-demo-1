The verse was naturally doggerel, and maybe given in English as  follows--                          \"Sweet Marietta,                           Rarely has been                         A sweeter or better                           Face or form seen;                         My chestnut tresses,                           And my Spanish fall,                         Would eclipse all the dresses                           At the masked ball.                         Then why, Marietta.                           Dally?--ah, no!                         Pluck up, you'd better,                           Your courage and go!\"    And as she came to the last line, this impudent little maid whirled round,  spinning her skirts about her like a top.    Mathias was enraptured.    With difficulty he kept himself from applauding.    \"She'd make her fortune upon the stage,\" he said to himself.    Marietta had made quite a conquest; a double conquest, it might almost  be said.    The hidden robber was enraptured, and she was scarcely less pleased with  herself.    \"I'll go,\" she said to herself, \"Why should I not? They'll never find it  out; I can do just as Cenerentola (Cinderella) did, and who knows but  that some prince might fall over head and ears in love with me? I can get  back long before they do.\"    Out she skipped too, and tripped down the stairs.    She was off to the ball.    Little dreamt she that for the last half hour her life hung upon the  most slender thread.    And now, the coast being clear, the three brigands prepared to carry out  their plans.          CHAPTER II.    AT THE CONTESSA'S FETE--A ROMANTIC ADVENTURE BETWEEN CERTAIN OLD FRIENDS.      The most brilliant fete of the year was that given by the  rich Contessa Maraviglia at her palazzo.    All the rank and fashion of the land were there.    The palazzo itself was a building of great beauty, and stood in grounds  of great extent.    The contessa, who was a widow, had a princely fortune, and she spent  it lavishly too.    Upon the night of the masquerade the gardens were brilliantly lighted.    Upon the miniature lake there was a fairy gondola, with a coloured  lantern dangling at the prow, and hung with curtains of pale blue silk  gauze.    In this gondola a lady was seated.    She had taken to the gondola, not alone for the sake of the freshness of  the breeze upon the water, but to read without interruption a letter she  had received from a mysterious man who professed to be deeply smitten  with her charms, and who, the messenger of love let fall, was a prince.    She wore a black domino, but was not masked, for as she threw back its  folds to breathe more freely, you could see that her only veil was a  thick fall of black lace, fastened to a high comb in the back of her  head.    \"I hope he will not be long,\" said she to herself, while her heart beat  high with expectation. \"His note says clearly enough on the lake in the  fairy gondola. Well, it will certainly be nice to be a princess, but I  do hope that his highness may prove to be a dashing, handsome youth,  such as a Cinderella might sigh for. Hush, boatman!\"    \"Lady?\"    \"Do you hear?\"    \"Someone singing on the bank yonder? Yes! I hear, lady.\"    \"Row that way.\"    A voice was heard carolling gently the serenade--\"Fair shines the moon  to-night.\"    The voice meant well, evidently, but something rather spoilt the effect.    It was not altogether in tune, nor had the singer the best idea in the  world of time.    Perhaps his singing was spoilt by excess of love.    Perhaps by liquor.    The latter idea was suggested by a certain unsteadiness that would  appear to indicate both love and liquor.    Be that as it may, the singer was not at all aware of the disadvantages  under which he laboured.    On the contrary, he had the greatest belief in himself.    \"Boatman,\" exclaimed the lady, impatiently, \"row me ashore.\"    \"Yes, lady.\"    He obeyed, as he spoke, and as the boat grounded, the hidden minstrel  stepped forward.    The gallant was rather a tall man, masked and habited in a long cloak,  which almost concealed a glittering and gorgeous costume beneath.    This cavalier hastened to tender the lady his hand and to assist her to  disembark.    As soon as she was fairly upon _terra firma_ the gentleman led her  away to a more secluded part of the garden, and then ensued a brief but  highly interesting conversation.    It took place in the Italian language.    That beautiful tongue was not to say elegantly spoken upon either side.    The gentleman spoke as a foreigner, but imperfectly acquainted with the  idiom.    \"Sir,\" said the lady, after an embarrassing silence upon his part, \"I  scarcely know if I ought to be here.\"    \"Nor I either, my dear lady,\" began the gallant.    But then, aware that this was not exactly what might have been expected  of him, he stammered and broke down.    \"Poor prince,\" thought the lady, with a very unladylike chuckle to  herself. \"How embarrassed he is.\"    The cavalier stared at her through the great eyes in his mask, as he  muttered to himself--    \"She is evidently in love with me very badly; I am curious to learn how  a princess makes love. I am anxious only of course to study it as a  matter of curiosity.\"    \"I ought not to have come here, prince,\" said the lady, in a nervous  tone.    Prince!    The word made the masked gentleman stare.    \"Prince! I suppose that she can't know I am a married man, and goes  straight to the question. This is popping the question sharply.\"    He had never been made love to before by a lady of any degree, much  less by a princess, so he was exceedingly anxious to see how she would  begin upon this occasion.    But after they had got to a quiet and remote part of the garden, they  came to a dead lock.    Not a word was spoken upon either side.    \"I wish he would say something to me,\" thought the lady.    She was not used to such bashful suitors.    \"I have kept your appointment, sir,\" she said, \"although I fear I am  very wrong.\"    \"My appointment,\" muttered the cavalier in English, \"Come, I like  that.\"    However, he added in the softest tones he could assume--    \"Fear nothing, princess, I am not a dangerous man.\"    She thought he was, though, for as he said this he chuckled.    The lady dropped her eyes before his bold glance and looked as timid as  you could wish.    Now this appeared only to encourage the gentleman, for he seized her  round the waist and pressed a kiss upon the only part of her cheek  which was left uncovered by her veil.    She struggled feebly, oh, very feebly to release herself; but that  libertine masker held her firmly; that is, as firmly as possible, for  he was not very strong upon his pins.    \"Sir, you must not take advantage of my unprotected situation,\" she  faltered.    \"I should be very sorry to, my coy princess,\" said the gallant.    These words set her heart beating like clockwork.    \"He means well,\" she thought, growing quite easy in her mind.    Meanwhile the ardent young lover, growing bolder by encouragement,  wanted to remove her veil.    \"Grant me one favour, my princess,\" he said. \"Let me bask in the  sunshine of your eyes; let me feast my vision upon your rare beauty.\"    The lady was enraptured at such poetical imagery.    \"It sounds like a lovely book,\" she murmured in ecstasy.    But she would not accede to his request.    She was so filled with joy, so supremely happy, that she feared to  break the enchanting spell by any accident.    \"Desist, prince,\" she said, struggling gently in his embrace,    \"I must gaze on that angelic face,\" said the passionate Adonis.    \"Why,\" exclaimed the lady, \"since you know it so well?\"    \"Know it!\" exclaimed the gallant in surprise.    \"Yes.\"    \"I have never seen it.\"    \"Yet your letter praises each feature to the skies.\"    \"My letter!\"    He was staggered evidently.    \"Undoubtedly.\"    \"I sent no letter.\"    The lady was amazed \"If you sent no letter, why are you here?\" she  demanded.    \"In obedience to yours,\" responded the gallant.    \"My what?\"    \"Your note--your ever-to-be-treasured missive,\" gushed the swain.    Now what would have followed in the way of explanations it is  impossible to say, for at the momentous crisis, a voice close by was  heard repeating softly a couplet heard before--                       \"Dear Marietta,                        Never had been                      A sweeter or neater                        Face or form seen.\"    The lady started and screamed, and would have fallen had not the  protecting arm of the gentleman been there to catch her.    But her veil fell aside.    When the lover saw her face, he was staggered, and he nearly let her  fall.    \"Marietta!\" he exclaimed, \"Marietta! Mrs. Harkaway's maid, by all  that's wonderful.\"    \"Oho,\" screamed the lady, \"you're standing on my toe!\" saying which she  jerked herself back, and dragging his foot away too, down he went.    \"It's Mr. Mole,\" shrieked the lady; and catching up her pink skirt and  black lace flounces, she fled precipitately along the path, leaving her  admirer scrambling in the most undignified manner upon the gravel walk.    Poor Mr. Mole.    But oh, poor Marietta; how sadly was she disappointed with her prince.          CHAPTER III.    MR. MOLE--THE THREE DEVILS AND THEIR DEVILMENT--THE CONTESSA'S  JEWELS--AN ALARM.      \"Mr. Mole--Mr. Mole!\"    It was Harvey's voice.    Now Mr. Mole was convinced at once that Dick was at the bottom of this  comical conspiracy in which he had been made to look so ridiculous. So  he resolved at first not to make any reply.    But Harvey was guided to the spot by information which had been  furnished him concerning Mr. Mole, and soon he appeared in sight.    \"Mr. Mole--Mr. Mole!\" exclaimed Dick, in grave reproof.    \"Help me up, Harvey,\" said Mole, \"and don't be a fool.\"    \"Well, that'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7346"],[0,"Among Malay Pirates : a Tale of Adventure and Peril (#3)"],[1," had  been alone, and had tried to save a man or a woman, in such a state of  funk that there was a good chance of their throwing their arms round  your neck and pulling you down with them, there might be something in  it, though everyone takes his chance of that when he jumps in to save  anyone from drowning; but with a little child, and two of us to do it,  and the ship close at hand, it was not worth thinking of for a moment.\"    \"No, Parkhurst, from your point of view the thing was not, as you say,  worth giving a thought to; but, you see, that is not the point of view  of the chief. To him it is nothing whether your exploit was a gallant  one or not, or whether you ran any danger; the point simply is, his  child would have been drowned had you not seen her and fished her out,  and that it is to you that he owes her life. I think you have reason to  congratulate yourselves on having made a friend who may be very useful  to you. It may be that there will be trouble up the river; and if so, he  might possibly be of real service to you. But in any case he may be able  to give you some good hunting and fishing, and show you things that you  would never have had an opportunity of seeing without his friendship and  assistance.\"    \"I did not think of that, Doctor; yes, that would certainly be a great  thing.\"    \"I can assure you I look at it in that light myself, Parkhurst, and I  am looking forward to paying him a visit, as, under his protection, I  should get opportunities of collecting which I could never have in the  ordinary way; for, unless they are greatly maligned, one could not trust  one's self among the Malays without some special protection.\"    \"But they are not savages, Doctor. Hassan is a perfect gentleman in  manner, and in that silk jacket of his and handsome sarong he really  looks like a prince. I could not help thinking that all of us looked  poor creatures by his side.\"    \"They certainly cannot be called savages, though from our point of  view many of their customs are of a very savage nature. Piracy is very  general among those living on the seacoast or on the great rivers; but  it must be remembered that it is not so very many centuries ago that a  toll was demanded of all passersby by the barons having castles on  the Rhine and other navigable rivers; the crews of wrecked ships were  plundered on every coast of Europe, our own included, not so very long  ago; and in the days of Elizabeth, Drake and Hawkins were regarded by  the Spaniards as pirates of the worst class, and I fear that there was a  good deal of justice in the accusation. But the Malays are people with a  history; they believe themselves that they were the original inhabitants  of the island of Sumatra; however, it is certain that in the twelfth  century they had extended their rule over the whole of that island and  many of its neighbors, and in the thirteenth had established themselves  on this peninsula and had founded an empire extending over the greater  part of the islands down to the coast of Australia. They had by this  time acquired the civilization of India, and their sultans were powerful  monarchs. They carried on a great trade with China, Hindoostan, and  Siam, and their maritime code was regulated and confirmed, as early as  1276, by Mohammed Shah.\"    \"How is it that they have come to such grief, Doctor?\"    \"Principally by the fact that they had the feudal, or you may call it  the tribal, system. Each petty chief and his followers made war on his  neighbors if he was strong enough; and as some tribes conquered others,  the empire became split up into an indefinite number of clans, whose  chiefs paid but a very nominal allegiance to the sultan. So islands  broke off from the empire until it had practically ceased to exist, and  the Malays were a people united only by similar customs and language,  but in no other respect, and were, therefore, able to offer but slight  resistance on the arrival of the Dutch and Portuguese in these regions.  Still, the upper classes preserve the memory of their former greatness.  The people are intelligent, and most of the trade in this part of  the world is carried on by them. They are enterprising, and ready to  emigrate if they see a chance of improving their fortunes. You know we  saw many of them at the Cape when we touched there. Nominally they are  Mohammedans in religion; but they do not strictly observe the ordinances  of the Koran, and their Mohammedanism is mixed up with traces of their  original religion.\"    \"Ah, that explains why the chief's name was Hassan. I wondered that a  Malay should have a Mohammedan name. They are not much like Arabs in  figure. Of course, Hassan is a very fine looking man, and some of the  other chiefs we saw at Penang were so; but most of them are shorter than  we are, and very ugly.\"    \"Yes, in figure and some other points they much resemble the Burmese,  who are probably blood relations of theirs. The chiefs are finer men, as  you will always find in the case in savage or semi savage peoples, for,  of course, they have the pick of the women, and naturally choose the  best looking. Their food, too, is better and their work less rough than  that of the people at large.    \"The sons and daughters of the chiefs naturally intermarry, and the  result is that in most cases you will find the upper classes taller,  better formed, lighter in color, and of greater intelligence than the  rest of the people. This would be specially the case in a trading people  like the Malays; their ships would bring over girls purchased in India,  just as the ruling classes in Turkey used to obtain their wives from  Circassia; and this, no doubt, has helped to modify the original Malay  type.\"    \"Thank you, Doctor; I think I shall like the Malays now I know something  about them. Is it true that they are so treacherous?\"    \"I don't know, Parkhurst; doubtless they are treacherous in their wars;  that is to say that they consider any means fair to deceive an enemy;  but I do not think that they are so, beyond that. The Dutch have never  had any very great difficulty with them, nor have we in the portion  of the peninsula where we have established our rule. Of course, I know  little about them myself, as I have only been out here a few months; but  I am told that as traders they can be trusted, and that the word of a  Malay chief can be taken with absolute confidence. Of course, among the  majority of the people of the peninsula we are regarded with jealousy  and hostility--they dread that we should extend our dominion over them,  and it is not surprising that they should by every means in their power  strive to prevent our coming far inland. The chiefs on the rivers are,  as a rule, specially hostile.    \"In the first place, because their towns and villages are more  accessible to us, and they know more of our power than those dwelling  in the hill country; and, secondly, because they depend largely upon the  revenue that they derive from taxing all goods passing up and down, and  which they not unreasonably think they might lose if we were to become  paramount. No doubt there is much that Hassan said of Sehi that is true  and is applicable to other chiefs who have placed themselves under our  protection--namely, that they have so injured trade by their exactions  as to incur the hostility of their neighbors. Of course, I am not  speaking of such men as the Rajahs of Johore and Perac, who are  enlightened men, and have seen the benefits to be derived from  intercourse with us. Their people are agriculturists, and they are  really on a par with the protected states in India.    \"There is a great future before the country; gold is found in many of  the rivers, tin is probably more abundant than in any other part of the  world, and the exports are now very large; there are immense quantities  of valuable timber, such as teak, sandalwood, and ebony. The climate is,  except on the low land near the rivers, very healthy; nutmegs, cloves,  and other spices can be grown there, and indigo, chocolate, pepper,  opium, the sugarcane, coffee, and cotton, are all successfully  cultivated. Some day, probably, the whole peninsula will fall under our  protection, and when the constant tribal feuds are put a stop to, the  forests cleared, and the ground cultivated, as is the case in our own  settlement of Malacca, it will be found one of the most valuable of our  possessions. Any amount of labor can be obtained from China, and it is  probable that the races who inhabit the mountainous districts, who are  said to be industrious and peaceable, will also readily adapt themselves  to the changed conditions. They are not Malays like the people of the  lowlands, but are a black race with curly wool, like the natives of  Africa, and probably inhabited the whole peninsula before the arrival of  the Malays.\"    \"How funny that there should be niggers here,\" Harry said.    \"They are not exactly negroes, but one of the races known as negritos,  having, of course, many negro characteristics, but differing from the  African negroes in some important particulars. To them our supremacy  would be an unmixed blessing; their products would reach the coast  untaxed, and they would obtain all European goods at vastly cheaper  rates. A minor benefit to be obtained by our supremacy is that our  sportsmen would certainly speedily diminish the number of wild beasts  that at present are a scourge to cultivators; the tigers would be  killed down, the elephants captured and utilized, and the poor people  would not see their plantations ravaged, but would be able to travel  through their forests without the constant danger of being carried  off by tigers and panthers, and possibly be able to cross their rivers  without the risk of being snapped up by alligators; though, doubtless,  it would take some time before this would be brought about.\"    \"And when do you think that we shall be going up the river,"]]]
