Holy and sacred queen, Demeter's daughter, O, what a jolly whiff    of pork breathed o'er me!      DIO. Hist! and perchance you'll get some tripe yourself.      _(The welcome to Iacchus.)_      CHOR. Come, arise, from sleep awaking,      come the fiery torches shaking,      O Iacchus! O Iacchus!      Morning Star that shinest nightly.      Lo, the mead is blazing brightly,      Age forgets its years and sadness,      Aged knees curvet for gladness,      Lift thy flashing torches o'er us,      Marshal all thy blameless train,      Lead, O lead the way before us;      lead the lovely youthful Chorus      To the marshy flowery plain.      _(The warning-off of the profane.)_      All evil thoughts and profane be still: far hence, far hence from our         choirs depart,    Who knows not well what the Mystics tell, or is not holy and pure of         heart;    Who ne'er has the noble revelry learned, or danced the dance of the         Muses high;    Or shared in the Bacchic rites which old bull-eating Cratinus's words         supply;    Who vulgar coarse buffoonery loves, though all untimely the jests they         make;    Or lives not easy and kind with all, or kindling faction forbears to         slake,    But fans the fire, from a base desire some pitiful gain for himself to         reap;    Or takes, in office, his gifts and bribes, while the city is tossed on         the stormy deep;    Who fort or fleet to the foe betrays; or, a vile Thorycion, ships away    Forbidden stores from Aegina's shores, to Epidaurus across the Bay    Transmitting oarpads and sails and tar, that curst collector of five         per cents;    The knave who tries to procure supplies for the use of the enemy's         armaments;    The Cyclian singer who dares befoul the Lady Hecate's wayside shrine;    The public speaker who once lampooned in our Bacchic feast, would, with         heart malign,    Keep nibbling away the Comedians' pay;--to these I utter my warning         cry,    I charge them once, I charge them twice, I charge them thrice, that         they draw not nigh    To the sacred dance of the Mystic choir. But YE, my comrades, awake the         song,    The night-long revels of joy and mirth which ever of right to our feast         belong.      (_The start of the procession_.)        Advance, true hearts, advance!      On to the gladsome bowers,      On to the sward, with flowers           Embosomed bright!      March on with jest, and jeer, and dance,      Full well ye've supped to-night.      (_The processional hymn to Persephone_.)        March, chanting loud your lays,      Your hearts and voices raising,      The Saviour goddess praising           Who vows she'll still      Our city save to endless days,      Whate'er Thorycion's will.      Break off the measure, and change the time; and now with chanting and         hymns adorn    Demeter, goddess mighty and high, the harvest-queen, the giver of corn.      (_The processional hymn to Demeter_.)        O Lady, over our rites presiding,      Preserve and succour thy choral throng,      And grant us all, in thy help confiding,      To dance and revel the whole day long;      AND MUCH in earnest, and much in jest,      Worthy thy feast, may we speak therein.      And when we have bantered and laughed our best,      The victor's wreath be it ours to win.      Call we now the youthful god, call him hither without delay,    Him who travels amongst his chorus, dancing along on the Sacred Way.      (_The processional hymn to Iacchus_.)        O, come with the joy of thy festival song,      O, come to the goddess, O, mix with our throng      Untired, though the journey be never so long.           O Lord of the frolic and dance,           Iacchus, beside me advance!      For fun, and for cheapness, our dress thou hast rent,      Through thee we may dance to the top of our bent,      Reviling, and jeering, and none will resent.           O Lord of the frolic and dance,           Iacchus, beside me advance!      A sweet pretty girl I observed in the show,      Her robe had been torn in the scuffle, and lo,      There peeped through the tatters a bosom of snow.           O Lord of the frolic and dance,           Iacchus, beside me advance!      DIO. Wouldn't I like to follow on, and try    A little sport and dancing?      XAN. Wouldn't I?      (_The banter at the bridge of Cephisus_.)        CHOR. Shall we all a merry joke      At Archedemus poke,      Who has not cut his guildsmen yet, though seven years old;      Yet up among the dead      He is demagogue and head,      And contrives the topmost place of the rascaldom to hold?      And Cleisthenes, they say, Is among the tombs all day,      Bewailing for his lover with a lamentable whine.      And Callias, I'm told,      Has become a sailor bold,      And casts a lion's hide o'er his members feminine.        DIO. Can any of you tell      Where Pluto here may dwell,      For we, sirs, are two strangers who were never here before?        CHOR. O, then no further stray,      Nor again enquire the way,      For know that ye have journeyed to his very entrance-door        DIO. Take up the wraps, my lad.        XAN. Now is not this too bad?      Like \"Zeus's Corinth,\" he \"the wraps\" keeps saying o'er and o'er.        CHOR. Now wheel your sacred dances through the glade with flowers          bedight,      All ye who are partakers of the holy festal rite;      And I will with the women and the holy maidens go      Where they keep the nightly vigil, an auspicious light to show.      (_The departure for the Thriasian Plain_)        Now haste we to the roses,      And the meadows full of posies,      Now haste we to the meadows           In our own old way,      In choral dances blending,      In dances never ending,      Which only for the holy           The Destinies array.      O happy mystic chorus,      The blessed sunshine o'er us      On us alone is smiling,           In its soft sweet light:      On us who strove for ever      With holy, pure endeavour,      Alike by friend and stranger           To guide our steps aright.      DIO. What's the right way to knock? I wonder how    The natives here are wont to knock at doors.      XAN. No dawdling: taste the door. You've got, remember,    The lion-hide and pride of Heracles.      DIO. Boy! boy!      AEACUS. Who's there?      DIO. I, Heracles the strong!      AEAC. O, you most shameless desperate ruffian, you!    O, villain, villain, arrant vilest villain!    Who seized our Cerberus by the throat, and fled,    And ran, and rushed, and bolted, haling off    The dog, my charge! But now I've got thee fast.    So close the Styx's inky-hearted rock,    The blood-bedabbled peak of Acheron    Shall hem thee in: the hell-hounds of Cocytus    Prowl round thee; whilst the hundred-headed Asp    Shall rive thy heart-strings: the Tartesian Lamprey,    Prey on thy lungs: and those Tithrasian Gorgons    Mangle and tear thy kidneys, mauling them,    Entrails and all, into one bloody mash.    I'll speed a running foot to fetch them hither.      XAN. Hallo! what now?      DIO. I've done it: call the god.      XAN. Get up, you laughing-stock; get up directly, Before you're seen.      DIO. What, _I_ get up? I'm fainting. Please dab a sponge of water on my    heart.      XAN. Here!      DIO. Dab it, you.      XAN. Where? O, ye golden gods, Lies your heart THERE?      DIO. It got so terrified    It fluttered down into my stomach's pit.      XAN. Cowardliest of gods and men!      DIO. The cowardliest? I? What I, who asked you for a sponge, a thing    A coward never would have done!      XAN. What then?      DIO. A coward would have lain there wallowing;    But I stood up, and wiped myself withal.      XAN. Poseidon! quite heroic.      DIO. 'Deed I think so. But weren't _you_ frightened at those dreadful    threats And shoutings?      XAN, Frightened? Not a bit. I cared not.      DIO. Come then, if you're so _very_ brave a man,    Will you be I, and take the hero's club    And lion's skin, since you're so monstrous plucky?    And I'll be now the slave, and bear the luggage.      XAN. Hand them across. I cannot choose but take them.    And now observe the Xanthio-heracles    If I'm a coward and a sneak like you.      DIO. Nay, you're the rogue from Melite's own self.    And I'll pick up and carry on the traps.      MAID. O welcome, Heracles! come in, sweetheart.    My Lady, when they told her, set to work,    Baked mighty loaves, boiled two or three tureens    Of lentil soup, roasted a prime ox whole,    Made rolls and honey-cakes. So come along.      XAN. (Declining.) You are too kind.      MAID. I will not let you go. I will not LET you! Why, she's stewing    slices Of juicy bird's-flesh, and she's making comfits, And tempering    down her richest wine. Come, dear, Come along in.      XAN. (Still declining.) Pray thank her.      MAID. O you're jesting, I shall not let you off: there's such a lovely    Flute-girl all ready, and we've two or three Dancing-girls also.      XAN. Eh! what! Dancing-girls?      MAID. Young budding virgins, freshly tired and trimmed.    Come, dear, come in. The cook was dishing up    The cutlets, and they are bringing in the tables.      XAN. Then go you in, and tell those dancing-girls    Of whom you spake, I'm coming in    Myself. Pick up the traps, my lad, and follow me.      DIO. Hi! stop! you're not in earnest, just because I dressed you up, in    fun, as Heracles? Come, don't keep fooling, Xanthias, but lift    And carry in the traps yourself.      XAN. Why! what! You are never going to strip me of these togs    You gave me!      DIO. Going to? No, I'm doing it now.    Off with that lion-skin.      XAN. Bear witness all    The gods shall judge between us.      DIO. Gods indeed! Why how could _you_ (the vain and foolish thought!)    A slave, a mortal, act Alcmena's son?      XAN.

 for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.    01:006:013 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before  me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I  will destroy them with the earth.    01:006:014 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the  ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.    01:006:015 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The  length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty  cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.    01:006:016 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt  thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side  thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.    01:006:017 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the  earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under  heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.    01:006:018 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt  come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives  with thee.    01:006:019 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort  shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall  be male and female.    01:006:020 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of  every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort  shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.    01:006:021 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou  shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for  them.    01:006:022 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so  did he.    01:007:001 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into  the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.    01:007:002 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the  male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male  and his female.    01:007:003 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female;  to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.    01:007:004 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the  earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I  have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.    01:007:005 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.    01:007:006 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters  was upon the earth.    01:007:007 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'  wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.    01:007:008 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of  fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,    01:007:009 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male  and the female, as God had commanded Noah.    01:007:010 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the  flood were upon the earth.    01:007:011 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second  month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the  fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were  opened.    01:007:012 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.    01:007:013 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and  Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his  sons with them, into the ark;    01:007:014 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle  after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth  after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.    01:007:015 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all  flesh, wherein is the breath of life.    01:007:016 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh,  as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.    01:007:017 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters  increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.    01:007:018 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the  earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.    01:007:019 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all  the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.    01:007:020 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the  mountains were covered.    01:007:021 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl,  and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth  upon the earth, and every man:    01:007:022 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was  in the dry land, died.    01:007:023 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the  face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and  the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah  only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.    01:007:024 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty  days.    01:008:001 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the  cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over  the earth, and the waters asswaged;    01:008:002 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were  stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;    01:008:003 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and  after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.    01:008:004 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth  day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.    01:008:005 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month:  in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the  mountains seen.    01:008:006 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah  opened the window of the ark which he had made:    01:008:007 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until  the waters were dried up from off the earth.    01:008:008 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were  abated from off the face of the ground;    01:008:009 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she  returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the  whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in  unto him into the ark.    01:008:010 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth  the dove out of the ark;    01:008:011 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her  mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were  abated from off the earth.    01:008:012 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;  which returned not again unto him any more.    01:008:013 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in  the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up  from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and  looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.    01:008:014 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of  the month, was the earth dried.    01:008:015 And God spake unto Noah, saying,    01:008:016 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and  thy sons' wives with thee.    01:008:017 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee,  of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing  that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the  earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.    01:008:018 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his  sons' wives with him:    01:008:019 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and  whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of  the ark.    01:008:020 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every  clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the  altar.    01:008:021 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his  heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for  the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I  again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.    01:008:022 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and  heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.    01:009:001 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be  fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.    01:009:002 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every  beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth  upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are  they delivered.    01:009:003 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as  the green herb have I given you all things.    01:009:004 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof,  shall ye not eat.    01:009:005 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the  hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the  hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.    01:009:006 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed:  for in the image of God made he man.    01:009:007 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly  in the earth, and multiply therein.    01:009:008 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,    01:009:009 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with  your seed after you;    01:009:010 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl,  of the"]]]
