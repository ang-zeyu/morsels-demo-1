It is better suited to a sterile country like  Patagonia than to the grassy humid plain; nevertheless it was found  throughout the whole of the pampas; but in a country where the wisdom of  a Sir William Harcourt was never needed to slip the leash, this king of  the Rodentia is now nearly extinct.    A common rodent is the coypu--Myiopotamus coypu--yellowish in colour  with bright red incisors; a rat in shape, and as large as an otter. It  is aquatic, lives in holes in the banks, and where there are no banks it  makes a platform nest among the rushes. Of an evening they are all out  swimming and playing in the water, conversing together in their strange  tones, which sound like the moans and cries of wounded and suffering  men; and among them the mother-coypu is seen with her progeny, numbering  eight or nine, with as many on her back as she can accommodate, while  the others swim after her, crying for a ride.    With reference to this animal, which, as we have seen, is prolific, a  strange thing once happened in Buenos Ayres. The coypu was much more  abundant fifty years ago than now, and its skin, which has a fine fur  under the long coarse hair, was largely exported to Europe. About that  time the Dictator Rosas issued a decree prohibiting the hunting of the  coypu. The result was that the animals increased and multiplied  exceedingly, and, abandoning their aquatic habits, they became  terrestrial and migratory, and swarmed everywhere in search of food.  Suddenly a mysterious malady fell on them, from which they quickly  perished, and became almost extinct.    What a blessed thing it would be for poor rabbit-worried Australia if a  similar plague should visit that country, and fall on the right animal!  On the other hand, what a calamity if the infection, wide-spread,  incurable, and swift as the wind in its course, should attack the  too-numerous sheep! And who knows what mysterious, unheard-of  retributions that revengeful deity Nature may not be meditating in her  secret heart for the loss of her wild four-footed children slain by  settlers, and the spoiling of her ancient beautiful order!    A small pampa rodent worthy of notice is the Cavia australis, called  _cui_ in the vernacular from its voice: a timid, social, mouse-coloured  little creature, with a low gurgling language, like running babbling  waters; in habits resembling its domestic pied relation the guinea pig.  It loves to run on clean ground, and on the pampas makes little  rat-roads all about its hiding-place, which little roads tell a story to  the fox, and such like; therefore the little cavy's habits, and the  habits of all cavies, I fancy, are not so well suited to the humid  grassy region as to other districts, with sterile ground to run and play  upon, and thickets in which to hide.    A more interesting animal is the Ctenomys magellanica, a little less  than the rat in size, with a shorter tail, pale grey fur, and red  incisors. It is called _tuco-tuco_ from its voice, and _oculto_ from its  habits; for it is a dweller underground, and requires a loose, sandy  soil in which, like the mole, it may _swim_ beneath the surface.  Consequently the pampa, with its heavy, moist mould, is not the tuco's  proper place; nevertheless, wherever there is a stretch of sandy soil,  or a range of dunes, there it is found living; not seen, but heard; for  all day long and all night sounds its voice, resonant and loud, like a  succession of blows from a hammer; as if a company of gnomes were  toiling far down underfoot, beating on their anvils, first with strong  measured strokes, then with lighter and faster, and with a swing and  rhythm as if the little men were beating in time to some rude chant  unheard above the surface. How came these isolated colonies of a species  so subterranean in habits, and requiring a sandy soil to move in, so far  from their proper district--that sterile country from which they are  separated by wide, unsuitable areas? They cannot perform long overland  journeys like the rat. Perhaps the dunes have travelled, carrying their  little cattle with them.    Greatest among the carnivores are the two cat-monarchs of South America,  the jaguar and puma. Whatever may be their relative positions elsewhere,  on the pampas the puma is mightiest, being much more abundant and better  able to thrive than its spotted rival. Versatile in its preying habits,  its presence on the pampa is not surprising; but probably only an  extreme abundance of large mammalian prey, which has not existed in  recent times, could have, tempted an animal of the river and  forest-loving habits of the jaguar to colonize this cold, treeless, and  comparatively waterless desert. There are two other important cats. The  grass-cat, not unlike Felis catus in its robust form and dark colour,  but a larger, more powerful animal, inexpressibly savage in disposition.  The second, Felis geoffroyi, is a larger and more beautiful animal,  coloured like a leopard; it is called wood-cat, and, as the name would  seem to indicate, is an intruder from wooded districts north of the  pampas.    There are two canines: one is Azara's beautiful grey fox-like dog,  purely a fox in habits, and common everywhere. The other is far more  interesting and extremely rare; it is called _aguara,_ its nearest ally  being the _aguara-guazu,_ the Canis jubatus or maned wolf of  naturalists, found north of the pampean district. The aguara is smaller  and has no mane; it is like the dingo in size, but slimmer and with a  sharper nose, and lias a much brighter red colour. At night when camping  out I have heard its dismal screams, but the screamer was sought in  vain; while from the gauchos of the frontier I could only learn that it  is a harmless, shy, solitary animal, that ever flies to remoter wilds  from its destroyer, man. They offered me a skin--what more could I want?  Simple souls! it was no more to me than the skin of a dead dog, with  long, bright red hair. Those who love dead animals may have them in any  number by digging with a. spade in that vast sepulchre of the pampas,  where perished the hosts of antiquity. I love the living that are above  the earth; and how small a remnant they are in South America we know,  and now yearly becoming more precious as it dwindles away.    The pestiferous skunk is universal; and there are two quaint-looking  weasels, intensely black in colour, and grey on the back and flat crown.  One, the Galictis barbara, is a large bold animal that hunts in  companies; and when these long-bodied creatures sit up erect, glaring  with beady eyes, grinning and chattering at the passer-by, they look  like little friars in black robes and grey cowls; but the expression on  their round faces is malignant and bloodthirsty beyond anything in  nature, and it would perhaps be more decent to liken them to devils  rather than to humans.    On the pampas there is, strictly speaking, only one ruminant, the Cervus  campestris, which is common. The most curious thing about this animal is  that the male emits a rank, musky odour, so powerful that when the wind  blows from it the effluvium comes in nauseating gusts to the nostrils  from a distance exceeding two miles. It is really astonishing that only  one small ruminant should be found on this immense grassy area, so  admirably suited to herbivorous quadrupeds, a portion of which at the  present moment affords sufficient pasture to eighty millions of sheep,  cattle, and horses. In La Plata the author of _The Mammoth and the  Flood_ will find few to quarrel with his doctrine.    Of Edentates there are four. The giant armadillo does not range so far,  and the delicate little pink fairy armadillo, the truncated  Chlamydophorus, is a dweller in the sand-dunes of Mendoza, and has never  colonized the grassy pampas. The Tatusia hybrida, called \"little mule\"  from the length of its ears, and the Dasypus tricinctus, which, when  disturbed, rolls itself into a ball, the wedge-shaped head and  wedge-shaped tail admirably fitting into the deep-cut shell side by  side; and the _quirquincho_ (Dasypus minutus), all inhabit the pampa,  are diurnal, and feed exclusively on insects, chiefly ants. Wherever the  country becomes settled, these three disappear, owing to the dulness of  their senses, especially that of sight, and to the diurnal habit, which  was an advantage to them, and enabled them to survive when rapacious  animals, which are mostly nocturnal, were their only enemies. The  fourth, and most important, is the hairy armadillo, with habits which  are in strange contrast to those of its perishing congeners, and which  seem to mock many hard-and-fast rules concerning animal life. It is  omnivorous, and will thrive on anything from grass to flesh, found dead  and in all stages of decay, or captured by means of its own strategy.  Furthermore, its habits change to suit its conditions: thus, where  nocturnal carnivores are its enemies, it is diurnal; but where man  appears as a chief persecutor, it becomes nocturnal. It is much hunted  for its flesh, dogs being trained for the purpose; yet it actually  becomes more abundant as population increases in any district; and, if  versatility in habits or adaptiveness can be taken as a measure of  intelligence, this poor armadillo, a survival of the past, so old on the  earth as to have existed contemporaneously with the giant glyptodon, is  the superior of the large-brained cats and canines.    To finish with the mammalia, there are two interesting opossums, both of  the genus Didelphys, but in habits as wide apart as cat from otter. One  of these marsupials appears so much at home on the plains that I almost  regret having said that the vizcacha alone gives us the idea of being in  its habits the _product_ of the pampas. This animal--Didelphys  crassicaudata--has a long slender, wedge-, shaped head"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7450"],[0,"Terre Napoleón; a History of French Explorations and Projects in Australia (#3)"],[1,"in 1788;  nor have any internal broils of serious importance interrupted her  prosperous career.    This striking variation from the common fate of peoples is attributable  to three causes. First, the development of a British civilisation in  Australia has synchronised with the attainment and unimpaired maintenance  of dominant sea-power by the parent nation. The supremacy of Great  Britain upon the blue water enabled her colonies to grow to strength and  wealth under the protection of a mighty arm. Secondly, during the same  period a great change in British colonial policy was inaugurated.  Statesmen were slow to learn the lessons taught in so trenchant a fashion  by the revolt of the American colonies; but more liberal views gradually  ripened, and Lord Durham's Report on the State of Canada, issued in 1839,  occasioned a beneficent new era of self-government. The states of  Australia were soon left with no grievance which it was not within their  own power to remedy if they chose, and virtually as they chose. Thirdly,  these very powers of self-government developed in the people a signal  capacity for governing and being governed. The constitutional machinery  submitted the Executive to popular control, and made it quickly sensitive  to the public will. Authority and subjects were in sympathy, because the  subjects created the authority. Further, there was no warlike native race  in Australia, as there was in New Zealand and in South Africa, to  necessitate armed conflict. Thus security from attack, chartered  autonomy, and governing capacity, with the absence of organised  pugnacious tribes, have combined to achieve the unique result of a  continent preserved from aggression, disruption, or bloody strife for  over one hundred and twenty years.    There was a brief period, as will presently be related, when this happy  state of things was in some danger of being disturbed. It certainly would  have been impossible had not Great Britain emerged victorious from her  protracted struggle, first against revolutionary France, and later  against Napoleon, in the latter years of the eighteenth century and the  beginning of the nineteenth.    In those wars colonial possessions \"became pawns in the game.\"* (* The  phrase is Professor Egerton's, Cambridge Modern History 9 735.) There was  no Imperialism then, with its strident note, its ebullient fervour and  flag waving. There was no national sense of pride in colonial Empire, or  general appreciation of the great potentialities of oversea possessions.  \"The final outcome of the great war was the colonial ascendancy of Great  Britain, but such was not the conscious aim of those who carried through  the struggle.\"* (* Ibid page 736.) Diplomacy signed away with a dash of  the quill possessions which British arms had won after tough fights,  anxious blockades, and long cruises full of tension and peril. Even when  the end of the war saw the great Conqueror conquered and consigned to his  foam-fenced prison in the South Atlantic, Great Britain gave back many of  the fruits which it had cost her much, in the lives of her brave and the  sufferings of her poor, to win; and Castlereagh defended this policy in  the House of Commons on the curious ground that it was expedient \"freely  to open to France the means of peaceful occupation, and that it was not  the interest of this country to make her a military and conquering,  instead of a commercial and pacific nation.\"* (* Parliamentary Debates 28  462.)    PART 2.    The events with which this book is mainly concerned occurred within the  four years 1800 to 1804, during which Europe saw Bonaparte leap from the  position of First Consul of the French Republic to the Imperial throne.  After great French victories at Marengo, Hochstadt, and Hohenlinden  (1800), and a brilliant naval triumph for the British at Copenhagen  (1801), came the fragile Peace of Amiens (1802)--an \"experimental peace,\"  as Cornwallis neatly described it. Fourteen months later (May 1803) war  broke out again; and this time there was almost incessant fighting on a  titanic scale, by land and sea, until the great Corsican was humbled and  broken at Waterloo.    The reader will be aided in forming an opinion upon the events discussed  hereafter, by a glance at the colonial situation during the period in  question. The extent of the dependencies of France and England in 1800  and the later years will be gathered from the following summary.    In America France regained Louisiana, covering the mouth of the  Mississippi. It had been in Spanish hands since 1763; but Talleyrand,  Bonaparte's foreign minister, put pressure upon Spain, and Louisiana  became French once more under the secret treaty of San Ildefonso (October  1800). The news of the retrocession, however, aroused intense feeling in  the United States, inasmuch as the establishment of a strong foreign  power at the mouth of the principal water-way in the country jeopardised  the whole trade of the Mississippi valley. President Jefferson,  recognising that the perpetuation of the new situation \"would have put us  at war with France immediately,\" sent James Monroe to Paris to negotiate.  As Bonaparte plainly saw at the beginning of 1803 that another war with  Great Britain was inevitable, he did not wish to embroil himself with the  Americans also, and agreed to sell the possession to the Republic for  eighty million francs. Indeed, he completed arrangements for the sale  even before Monroe arrived.    Some efforts had also been made, at Bonaparte's instance, to induce Spain  to give up the Floridas, East and West, but European complications  prevented the exertion of pressure in this direction; and the whole of  Florida became part of the United States by treaty signed in 1819. The  sale of Louisiana lowered the French flag on the only remaining portion  of American territory that acknowledged the tricolour, except the  pestilential fragment of French Guiana, on the north-east of South  America, where France has had a footing since the beginning of the  seventeenth century, save for a short interval (1809 to 1815) when it was  taken by the British and Portuguese. But the possession has never been a  profitable one, and a contemporary writer, quoting an official  publication, describes it as enjoying \"neither agriculture, commerce, nor  industry.\"* (* Fallot, L'Avenir Colonial de la France (1903) page 237.)    In the West Indies, France had lost Martinique and Guadeloupe during the  naval wars prior to Bonaparte's ascension to supreme authority. These  islands were restored to her under the Treaty of Amiens; were once more  captured by the British in 1809 to 1810; and were finally handed back to  France under the Treaty of Paris in 1814. Tobago and St. Lucia, taken  from France in 1803, were not restored.    The large island of San Domingo (the present republic of Haiti, the  Espanola of Columbus, and the first seat of European colonisation in the  west) had been occupied by French, Spanish, and British planters prior to  1796. The French had been there officially since Richelieu recognised and  protected the settlements made by filibusters early in the seventeenth  century. The decree of the revolutionary Assembly freeing the slaves in  all French possessions led to widespread insurrections. There were scenes  of frightful outrage; and above the storm of blood and horror rose to  fame the huge figure of the black hero, Toussaint L'Ouverture. At the  head of a negro army he at first assisted the French to overturn Spanish  rule; but having attained great personal power, and being a man of  astonishing capacity for controlling the people of his own race, and for  mastering military and governmental problems, he determined to use the  opportunity to found an autonomous state under the suzerainty of France.  By January 1801 Toussaint L'Ouverture was in possession of the capital.  But Bonaparte would not tolerate the domination of the black conqueror,  and despatched an expedition to San Domingo to overthrow his government  and establish French paramountcy. The result was disastrous. It is true  that Toussaint was captured and exiled to France, where he died miserably  in prison at Besancon in 1803; but the white troops under General Leclerc  perished of yellow fever in hundreds; the blacks retired to the mountains  and harassed the suffering French; whilst the vigilance of British  frigates, and the requirements of European policy, obviated all  possibility of effective reinforcements being sent. Gallic authority in  San Domingo ended ingloriously, for the negroes in 1803 drove the  debilitated chivalry of France in defeat and disaster to the sea, and  chose to be their ruler one who, like themselves, had commenced life as a  slave. Napoleon said at St. Helena that his attempt to subjugate San  Domingo was the greatest folly of his life.    In the Indian Ocean the French possessed the Isle of France (now, as a  British colony, called Mauritius) and Reunion. They had not yet  established themselves in Madagascar, though there was some trade between  the Mascareignes and the colonists of the Isle of France. Bonaparte  during the Consulate contemplated making definite attempts to colonise  Madagascar, and, early in 1801, called for a report from his first  colonial minister, Forfait. When he obtained the document, he sent it  back asking for more details, an indication that his interest in the  subject was more than one of transient curiosity. Forfait suggested the  project of establishing at Madagascar a penal colony such as the British  had at Port Jackson;* (* Prentout, L'Ile de France sous Decaen, 302.) but  subsequent events did not favour French colonial expansion, and nothing  was done.    The British captured Pondicherry and the other French settlements in  India in 1793, but agreed to restore them under the Treaty of Amiens. For  reasons which will be indicated later, however, the territories were"]]]
