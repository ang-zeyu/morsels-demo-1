[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4759"],[0,"The Romance of Rubber (#3)"],[1,"12, 1876, the several  thousand seedlings which had been raised from them were packed in  special cases and shipped to Ceylon on the other side of the globe  for the final and most important stage of the experiment.    How long the next five years must have seemed to the anxious  Wickham, for it was that long before the first rubber tree  flowered in the gardens at Heneratgoda, sixteen miles from  Colombo, where the trees had finally been planted. In this year,  1881, experiments in tapping began, and it was plain that  Wickham's dream was to be realized.    From these few trees, so carefully tended in their youth, has  sprung the whole rubber industry of Ceylon and the Far East.  Wickham must indeed have been proud to see the plantations  spreading from Ceylon to Malaya, where rubber was eagerly taken up  by planters who were despairing of ever making a living out of  coffee, and later to Sumatra and Java and Borneo. To-day rubber  plantations cover an area of over 3,000,000 acres, with a yearly  output of almost 360,000 tons, or about ten times the average  yearly output of \"wild rubber.\"    There is a curious coincidence in the fact that Wickham got his  idea about planting rubber trees in India at about the same time  that men in America began to experiment with the horseless  carriage. You may never have stopped to think of it, but  mechanical experts say that without rubber pneumatic tires,  automobiles could never have become the fine, swift vehicles they  are. It was a wonderful thing that when in the early part of this  century the automobile industry suddenly burst forth with a demand  for rubber so great that Brazil could never have hoped to supply  it, there was found ready in the Far East, as a result of the  planting that had been done there, a supply that took care of the  sudden emergency.    A little more than ten years ago American business men began to  take an interest in the rubber plantations. They have shown  characteristic energy in the field, and the greatest single rubber  plantation in the world is owned by an American company, the  United States Rubber Company. This plantation is on the island of  Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies, one of the best governed  colonies in the East. On this island is an orchard of rubber  trees, as beautifully laid out and as well cared for as any  orchard of fruit trees in our own country. For seventy square  miles, an area as large as the District of Columbia, the orderly  ranks of trees fill the gently rolling landscape, every inch of  which is weeded as carefully as a garden. It takes twenty thousand  employees to care for the trees, which number more than 5,000,000.    On this plantation the science of growing rubber trees has been  brought to a perfection known nowhere else in the world. Groups of  botanists, chemists and arboriculturists study constantly tree  diseases, methods of increasing the yield, and the other problems  of growing fine trees that will produce high grade rubber. Here,  by experiment and inspection, the secrets of the rubber tree are  being brought to light, so much so that growers look to this  plantation for leadership in methods of rubber culture. This great  project so far from American soil and in a field so new gives a  thrill of pride to the Americans visiting Sumatra on their way  around the world.          CHAPTER 6    PLANTATION LIFE      The moist but very hot climate which rubber trees require is found  only in a zone around the world between the parallels of latitude  thirty degrees north to thirty degrees south of the equator.  Within this zone there have been found more than 350 rubber  bearing trees, shrubs and vines. For this reason this zone is  called the Rubber Belt. As most of the rubber used commercially is  gathered from trees growing within a zone extending from ten  degrees north to ten degrees south of the equator, this latter  zone is sometimes called the Inner Rubber Belt.    If you will trace this belt on a map of the world you will see  that it includes the Amazon region which produces more than  three-quarters of the wild rubber used in manufacturing. Most of South  America's wild rubber is obtained from Brazil, the remainder from  Bolivia, Peru and Venezuela. Now continue the belt across the  Atlantic Ocean to Africa, where you will strike the Belgian Congo  which produces a small quantity of wild rubber. Partly owing to  the careless manner of gathering and partly to the fact that it is  not originally of as good quality as Brazilian rubber, Congo  rubber is not as valuable for manufacturing as Brazilian. Then  complete the circle by following the belt across the Indian Ocean  to Ceylon and the East Indies which contain the great rubber  plantations where most of the rubber used to-day comes from.    To establish a rubber plantation requires very careful planning.  The choice of a site is of first importance, for the planter must  find a locality having a moist climate with an evenly distributed  rain-fall where the temperature throughout the year does not fall  below seventy degrees Fahrenheit, and where there is protection  from the wind. There must also be, of course, access to a steady  labor supply and a convenient shipping port. As the proper climate  is a tropical one, there is usually dense jungle to be cleared  away. Immense trees and thick bushes, rank straggling weeds and  vines form an almost impenetrable jungle. To turn such a place  into a garden spot means a genuine battle against jungle  conditions. But gradually trees, shrubs and undergrowth are torn  out and burned, laying bare the rich soil ready for the plow of  the planter.    Meantime the rubber seedlings have been sprouted in nurseries.  When the ground is ready they are carefully taken up and  transplanted to the holes which have been made for them in the  field where they are to be permanently planted.    Though the growth of the trees is very rapid, sometimes as much as  twenty feet in the first year, there are five years of anxious  waiting and guarding against winds and disease before they are  ready to be tapped and so begin to reward the planters. At first  the yield of a tree is only about one-half pound of rubber a year,  and this increases so slowly that it is many years before it  amounts to as much as ten pounds a year. The highest yield ever  recorded was given by one of the original trees set out in the  gardens at Heneratgoda, which gave ninety-six and one-half pounds  in one year.    How different is life on the rubber plantations of to-day from the  life of the gatherer of wild rubber in the jungle. In Brazil, the  solitary workers have to plunge at dawn into the perilous forest,  with its lurking wildcats and jaguars, its coiled and creeping  serpents. The dwellings are flimsy huts, food is scarce and  expensive, and disease and fever cause many deaths.    On the other hand, workers on a well-managed plantation live in  comfortable houses in healthy surroundings and are supplied with  plenty of good food. In fact the conditions are so much better  than generally prevail among natives in the Orient that work on a  plantation is considered more desirable than most other forms of  labor. The unmarried men live in barracks, but the men with  families have individual houses with garden plots adjoining. Big  kitchens prepare and cook the food in the best native style.  Schools for the children, recreation centers for old and young,  and hospitals to care for the sick, are all parts of the  plantation organization.    In erecting hospitals and caring for the health of its plantation  workers, as in other branches of the rubber industry, America has  taken the lead. So well is this recognized, that the Dutch  Government has awarded a medal to the United States Rubber Company  for the efficiency and completeness of its plantation hospital,  which happens to be the largest private hospital in the East  Indies, having accommodations for nearly a thousand patients.          CHAPTER 7    HARVESTING THE RUBBER      It is a cheerful sight to see the workers, men and women, dressed  in all the colors of the rainbow, trooping out from their quarters  to begin the day's work. The tapping must be done early in the  day, for the latex or rubber juice stops flowing a few hours after  sunrise.    When the trees reach eighteen inches in girth at a point eighteen  inches from the ground, they are ready for tapping. This growth is  usually attained when the trees are about five years old.    In tapping, a narrow strip of bark is cut away with a knife, the  cut extending diagonally one-quarter of the way around the tree.  At each succeeding day's tapping the tapper widens the cut by  stripping off a sliver of bark one-twentieth of an inch in width.[2]  He must be careful not to cut into the wood of the tree, as such cuts  not only injure the tree but permit the sap to run into the latex  and spoil the rubber. When the tapper has made the proper gash in  the bark he inserts a little spout to carry the dripping latex to  a glass cup beneath.      [2] This method of tapping is shown on the front cover.      Later in the morning the workers make the rounds of the trees with  large milk cans, gathering the latex from the cups. When the cans  are full they are carried to a collecting station, called a  Coagulation Shed. It is as clean and well kept as a dairy. Here  the latex is weighed, and when each collector has been credited  with the amount he has brought, it is dumped into huge vats.    The next step is to extract the particles of rubber from the latex  and to harden them. The jungle method of hardening rubber is to  dip a wooden paddle in the latex and smoke it over a fire of wood  and palm nuts.[3] It is a back-breaking process to cover the paddle  with layer after layer, until a good-sized lump, usually called a  \"biscuit,\" is formed. The plantation method is a quicker and cleaner  one.

They are merely two different ways of expressing  the very same truth.    Without more words, I will simply set down the other ways in which  this upright oblong might be marked, adding the meaning in each  case.  By comparing them with the various cases of the horizontal  oblong, you will, I hope, be able to understand them clearly.    You will find it a good plan to examine yourself on this table,  by covering up first one column and then the other, and 'dodging  about', as the children say.    Also you will do well to write out for yourself two other tables--one  for the LOWER half of the cupboard, and the other for its RIGHT-HAND  half.    And now I think we have said all we need to say about the smaller  Diagram, and may go on to the larger one.      _________________________________________________                   |      Symbols.     |          Meanings.    _______________|_________________________________        -----      |       |     |     |       |     |     |  Some y are x';       |     |     |     i.e. Some nice are not-new.        -----      |       |     |     |       |  1  |     |       |     |     |        -----      |                   |        -----      |       |     |     |  No y are x;       |  0  |     |      i.e. No nice are new.       |     |     |        -----      |  [Observe that this is merely another way of       |     |     |      expressing \"No new are nice.\"]       |     |     |       |     |     |        -----      |                   |        -----      |       |     |     |       |     |     |  No y are x';       |     |     |      i.e. No nice are not-new.        -----      |       |     |     |       |  0  |     |       |     |     |        -----      |                   |        -----      |       |     |     |       |  1  |     |  Some y are x, and some are x';       |     |     |     i.e. Some nice are new, and some are        -----      |            not-new.       |     |     |       |  1  |     |       |     |     |        -----      |                   |        -----      |       |     |     |       |  0  |     |  No y are x, and none are x'; i.e. No y       |     |     |       exist;        -----      |     i.e. No Cakes are nice.       |     |     |       |  0  |     |       |     |     |        -----      |                   |        -----      |       |     |     |       |  1  |     |  All y are x;       |     |     |       i.e. All nice are new.        -----      |       |     |     |       |  0  |     |       |     |     |        -----      |                   |        -----      |       |     |     |       |  0  |     |  All y are x';       |     |     |       i.e. All nice are not-new.        -----      |       |     |     |       |  1  |     |       |     |     |        -----      |    _______________|_________________________________      This may be taken to be a cupboard divided in the same way as the  last, but ALSO divided into two portions, for the Attribute m.  Let  us give to m the meaning \"wholesome\": and let us suppose that all  WHOLESOME Cakes are placed INSIDE the central Square, and all the  UNWHOLESOME ones OUTSIDE it, that is, in one or other of the four  queer-shaped OUTER compartments.    We see that, just as, in the smaller Diagram, the Cakes in each  compartment had TWO Attributes, so, here, the Cakes in each compartment  have THREE Attributes: and, just as the letters, representing the  TWO Attributes, were written on the EDGES of the compartment, so,  here, they are written at the CORNERS.  (Observe that m' is supposed  to be written at each of the four outer corners.)  So that we can  tell in a moment, by looking at a compartment, what three Attributes  belong to the Things in it.  For instance, take No. 12.  Here we  find x, y', m, at the corners: so we know that the Cakes in it, if  there are any, have the triple Attribute, 'xy'm', that is, \"new,  not-nice, and wholesome.\" Again, take No. 16.  Here we find, at  the corners, x', y', m': so the Cakes in it are \"not-new, not-nice,  and unwholesome.\"  (Remarkably untempting Cakes!)    It would take far too long to go through all the Propositions,  containing x and y, x and m, and y and m which can be represented  on this diagram (there are ninety-six altogether, so I am sure you  will excuse me!) and I must content myself with doing two or three,  as specimens.  You will do well to work out a lot more for yourself.    Taking the upper half by itself, so that our Subject is \"new Cakes\",  how are we to represent \"no new Cakes are wholesome\"?    This is, writing letters for words, \"no x are m.\"  Now this tells us  that none of the Cakes, belonging to the upper half of the cupboard,  are to be found INSIDE the central Square: that is, the two  compartments, No. 11 and No. 12, are EMPTY.  And this, of course,  is represented by                         -------------------                    |         |         |                    |    _____|_____    |                    |   |     |     |   |                    |   |  0  |  0  |   |                    |   |     |     |   |                     -------------------      And now how are we to represent the contradictory Proposition \"SOME x  are m\"?  This is a difficulty I have already considered.  I think  the best way is to place a red counter ON THE DIVISION-LINE between  No. 11 and No. 12, and to understand this to mean that ONE of the  two compartments is 'occupied,' but that we do not at present know WHICH.  This I shall represent thus:--                         -------------------                    |         |         |                    |    _____|_____    |                    |   |     |     |   |                    |   |    -1-    |   |                    |   |     |     |   |                     -------------------    Now let us express \"all x are m.\"    This consists, we know, of TWO Propositions,                       \"Some x are m,\"               and \"No x are m'.\"    Let us express the negative part first.  This tells us that none  of the Cakes, belonging to the upper half of the cupboard, are to  be found OUTSIDE the central Square: that is, the two compartments,  No. 9 and No. 10, are EMPTY.  This, of course, is represented by                         -------------------                    | 0       |       0 |                    |    _____|_____    |                    |   |     |     |   |                    |   |     |     |   |                    |   |     |     |   |                     -------------------    But we have yet to represent \"Some x are m.\"  This tells us that  there are SOME Cakes in the oblong consisting of No. 11 and No.  12: so we place our red counter, as in the previous example, on  the division-line between No. 11 and No. 12, and the result is                         -------------------                    | 0       |       0 |                    |    _____|_____    |                    |   |     |     |   |                    |   |    -1-    |   |                    |   |     |     |   |                     -------------------      Now let us try one or two interpretations.    What are we to make of this, with regard to x and y?                         -------------------                    |         |       0 |                    |    _____|_____    |                    |   |     |     |   |                    |   |  1  |  0  |   |                    |   |     |     |   |                     -------------------      This tells us, with regard to the xy'-Square, that it is wholly  'empty', since BOTH compartments are so marked.  With regard to  the xy-Square, it tells us that it is 'occupied'.  True, it is only  ONE compartment of it that is so marked; but that is quite enough,  whether the other be 'occupied' or 'empty', to settle the fact that  there is SOMETHING in the Square.    If, then, we transfer our marks to the smaller Diagram, so as to  get rid of the m-subdivisions, we have a right to mark it                            -----------                       |     |     |                       |  1  |  0  |                       |     |     |                        -----------      which means, you know, \"all x are y.\"    The result would have been exactly the same, if the given oblong  had been marked thus:--                         -------------------                    | 1       |       0 |                    |    _____|_____    |                    |   |     |     |   |                    |   |     |  0  |   |                    |   |     |     |   |                     -------------------      Once more: how shall we interpret this, with regard to x and y?                         -------------------                    | 0       |       1 |                    |    _____|_____    |                    |   |     |     |   |                    |   |     |     |   |                    |   |     |     |   |                     -------------------      This tells us, as to the xy-Square, that ONE of its compartments  is 'empty'.  But this information is quite useless, as there is no  mark in the OTHER compartment.  If the other compartment happened  to be 'empty' too, the Square would be 'empty': and, if it happened  to be 'occupied', the Square would be 'occupied'.  So, as we do  not know WHICH is the case, we can say nothing about THIS Square.    The other Square, the xy'-Square, we know (as in the previous  example) to be 'occupied'.    If, then, we transfer our marks to the smaller Diagram, we get  merely this:--                            -----------                       |     |     |                       |     |  1  |                       |     |     |     "]]]
