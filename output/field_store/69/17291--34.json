Dr. Archie sat down in the rocking-chair. \"And how's Thea feeling  to-day?\"    He was quite as shy as his patient, especially when a third person  overheard his conversation. Big and handsome and superior to his fellow  townsmen as Dr. Archie was, he was seldom at his ease, and like Peter  Kronborg he often dodged behind a professional manner. There was  sometimes a contraction of embarrassment and self consciousness all over  his big body, which made him awkward--likely to stumble, to kick up  rugs, or to knock over chairs. If any one was very sick, he forgot  himself, but he had a clumsy touch in convalescent gossip.    Thea curled up on her side and looked at him with pleasure. \"All right.  I like to be sick. I have more fun then than other times.\"    \"How's that?\"    \"I don't have to go to school, and I don't have to practice. I can read  all I want to, and have good things,\"--she patted the grapes. \"I had  lots of fun that time I mashed my finger and you wouldn't let Professor  Wunsch make me practice. Only I had to do left hand, even then. I think  that was mean.\"    The doctor took her hand and examined the forefinger, where the nail had  grown back a little crooked. \"You mustn't trim it down close at the  corner there, and then it will grow straight. You won't want it crooked  when you're a big girl and wear rings and have sweethearts.\"    She made a mocking little face at him and looked at his new scarf-pin.  \"That's the prettiest one you ev-ER had. I wish you'd stay a long while  and let me look at it. What is it?\"    Dr. Archie laughed. \"It's an opal. Spanish Johnny brought it up for me  from Chihuahua in his shoe. I had it set in Denver, and I wore it to-day  for your benefit.\"    Thea had a curious passion for jewelry. She wanted every shining stone  she saw, and in summer she was always going off into the sand hills to  hunt for crystals and agates and bits of pink chalcedony. She had two  cigar boxes full of stones that she had found or traded for, and she  imagined that they were of enormous value. She was always planning how  she would have them set.    \"What are you reading?\" The doctor reached under the covers and pulled  out a book of Byron's poems. \"Do you like this?\"    She looked confused, turned over a few pages rapidly, and pointed to \"My  native land, good-night.\" \"That,\" she said sheepishly.    \"How about 'Maid of Athens'?\"    She blushed and looked at him suspiciously. \"I like 'There was a sound  of revelry,'\" she muttered.    The doctor laughed and closed the book. It was clumsily bound in padded  leather and had been presented to the Reverend Peter Kronborg by his  Sunday-School class as an ornament for his parlor table.    \"Come into the office some day, and I'll lend you a nice book. You can  skip the parts you don't understand. You can read it in vacation.  Perhaps you'll be able to understand all of it by then.\"    Thea frowned and looked fretfully toward the piano. \"In vacation I have  to practice four hours every day, and then there'll be Thor to take care  of.\" She pronounced it \"Tor.\"    \"Thor? Oh, you've named the baby Thor?\" exclaimed the doctor.    Thea frowned again, still more fiercely, and said quickly, \"That's a  nice name, only maybe it's a little--old fashioned.\" She was very  sensitive about being thought a foreigner, and was proud of the fact  that, in town, her father always preached in English; very bookish  English, at that, one might add.    Born in an old Scandinavian colony in Minnesota, Peter Kronborg had been  sent to a small divinity school in Indiana by the women of a Swedish  evangelical mission, who were convinced of his gifts and who skimped and  begged and gave church suppers to get the long, lazy youth through the  seminary. He could still speak enough Swedish to exhort and to bury the  members of his country church out at Copper Hole, and he wielded in his  Moonstone pulpit a somewhat pompous English vocabulary he had learned  out of books at college. He always spoke of \"the infant Saviour,\" \"our  Heavenly Father,\" etc. The poor man had no natural, spontaneous human  speech. If he had his sincere moments, they were perforce inarticulate.  Probably a good deal of his pretentiousness was due to the fact that he  habitually expressed himself in a book learned language, wholly remote  from anything personal, native, or homely. Mrs. Kronborg spoke Swedish  to her own sisters and to her sister-in-law Tillie, and colloquial  English to her neighbors. Thea, who had a rather sensitive ear, until  she went to school never spoke at all, except in monosyllables, and her  mother was convinced that she was tongue-tied. She was still inept in  speech for a child so intelligent. Her ideas were usually clear, but she  seldom attempted to explain them, even at school, where she excelled in  \"written work\" and never did more than mutter a reply.    \"Your music professor stopped me on the street to-day and asked me how  you were,\" said the doctor, rising. \"He'll be sick himself, trotting  around in this slush with no overcoat or overshoes.\"    \"He's poor,\" said Thea simply.    The doctor sighed. \"I'm afraid he's worse than that. Is he always all  right when you take your lessons? Never acts as if he'd been drinking?\"    Thea looked angry and spoke excitedly. \"He knows a lot. More than  anybody. I don't care if he does drink; he's old and poor.\" Her voice  shook a little.    Mrs. Kronborg spoke up from the next room. \"He's a good teacher, doctor.  It's good for us he does drink. He'd never be in a little place like  this if he didn't have some weakness. These women that teach music  around here don't know nothing. I wouldn't have my child wasting time  with them. If Professor Wunsch goes away, Thea'll have nobody to take  from. He's careful with his scholars; he don't use bad language. Mrs.  Kohler is always present when Thea takes her lesson. It's all right.\"  Mrs. Kronborg spoke calmly and judicially. One could see that she had  thought the matter out before.    \"I'm glad to hear that, Mrs. Kronborg. I wish we could get the old man  off his bottle and keep him tidy. Do you suppose if I gave you an old  overcoat you could get him to wear it?\" The doctor went to the bedroom  door and Mrs. Kronborg looked up from her darning.    \"Why, yes, I guess he'd be glad of it. He'll take most anything from me.  He won't buy clothes, but I guess he'd wear 'em if he had 'em. I've  never had any clothes to give him, having so many to make over for.\"    \"I'll have Larry bring the coat around to-night. You aren't cross with  me, Thea?\" taking her hand.    Thea grinned warmly. \"Not if you give Professor Wunsch a coat--and  things,\" she tapped the grapes significantly. The doctor bent over and  kissed her.          III    Being sick was all very well, but Thea knew from experience that  starting back to school again was attended by depressing difficulties.  One Monday morning she got up early with Axel and Gunner, who shared her  wing room, and hurried into the back living-room, between the  dining-room and the kitchen. There, beside a soft-coal stove, the  younger children of the family undressed at night and dressed in the  morning. The older daughter, Anna, and the two big boys slept upstairs,  where the rooms were theoretically warmed by stovepipes from below. The  first (and the worst!) thing that confronted Thea was a suit of clean,  prickly red flannel, fresh from the wash. Usually the torment of  breaking in a clean suit of flannel came on Sunday, but yesterday, as  she was staying in the house, she had begged off. Their winter underwear  was a trial to all the children, but it was bitterest to Thea because  she happened to have the most sensitive skin. While she was tugging it  on, her Aunt Tillie brought in warm water from the boiler and filled the  tin pitcher. Thea washed her face, brushed and braided her hair, and got  into her blue cashmere dress. Over this she buttoned a long apron, with  sleeves, which would not be removed until she put on her cloak to go to  school. Gunner and Axel, on the soap box behind the stove, had their  usual quarrel about which should wear the tightest stockings, but they  exchanged reproaches in low tones, for they were wholesomely afraid of  Mrs. Kronborg's rawhide whip. She did not chastise her children often,  but she did it thoroughly. Only a somewhat stern system of discipline  could have kept any degree of order and quiet in that overcrowded house.    Mrs. Kronborg's children were all trained to dress themselves at the  earliest possible age, to make their own beds,--the boys as well as the  girls,--to take care of their clothes, to eat what was given them, and  to keep out of the way. Mrs. Kronborg would have made a good chess  player; she had a head for moves and positions.    Anna, the elder daughter, was her mother's lieutenant. All the children  knew that they must obey Anna, who was an obstinate contender for  proprieties and not always fair minded. To see the young Kronborgs  headed for Sunday School was like watching a military drill. Mrs.  Kronborg let her children's minds alone. She did not pry into their  thoughts or nag them. She respected them as individuals, and outside of  the house they had a great deal of liberty. But their communal life was  definitely ordered.    In the winter the children breakfasted in the kitchen; Gus and Charley  and Anna first, while the younger children were dressing. Gus was  nineteen and was a clerk in a dry-goods store. Charley, eighteen months  younger, worked in a feed store. They left the house by the kitchen door  at seven o'clock, and then Anna helped her Aunt Tillie get the breakfast  for the younger ones. Without the help of this sister-in-law, Tillie  Kronborg, Mrs. Kronborg's life would have been a hard one. Mrs. Kronborg  often reminded Anna that \"no hired help would ever have taken the same  interest.\"    Mr. Kronborg came of a poorer stock than his wife; from a lowly,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44114"],[0,"A Jay of Italy (#3)"],[1,"made you accuse me of dishonour?'    'I did not.'    'Nay, is that to be a saint?'    'Whom the shoe fits, let her wear it.'    'Bernardo!  _Where got you the shoe_?'    'Does it fit, I say?'    'I fear me 'twas in some bagnio.'    'Where you had dropped it?  For shame!'    A rather long pause.    'I will not be angry--just yet.  Where got you the shoe, I say?  An  eavesdropper is well equipped for a prophet.'    'I am no eavesdropper.'    'Who enlightened you?'    'Your cicisbeo.'    'Under that title?'    'Nay; it is not the devil's policy to call himself devil.'    A shorter pause.    'But you had heard of me?'    'Nothing escapes the Church's hearing.  Besides, Messer Lanti's summer  lodge is within call, one may say of San Zeno.'    'You are daring.  Dost know in what high favour he stands with the  Duke?'    'Else how could he have compassed Uriah's dismissal to the wars?'    Silence, and then a sigh.    'Whom do you mean by Uriah?'    'Thy lord, the Count of Casa Caprona.'    'He is a soldier, and an old man.'    'Didst covenant with his age in thy marriage vows?'    'Bernardino, I am very sleepy.'    'Sleep, then, and forget thyself, and awake, another.'    She sighed, and put her arms softly about him and her cheek against his  shoulder.  Messer Lanti, falling back, saw her thus, with closed eyes;  and laughed, and then frowned, and cried boisterously--    'Hast converted her, Parablist?  Art a saint indeed?'    He spurred forward again, with a discontented look, and madam opened her  eyes.    'What gossips are thine old monks, Bernardino; and what hypocrites,  denouncing the licence they example!'    'I know not what you mean.'    'Are they all saints, then, in San Zeno?'    'That is for Rome to say.  It is a good law which lays down this wine of  sanctity to mature.  In a hundred years we shall know what stood the  test.'    'Ah me!  And I am but seventeen.  Will you speak for your Abbot?'    'Ay, like a dear son.'    'Is he your father, Bernardo?'    'Is he not the father of us all?'    'Maybe.  But 'tis of Benjamin I ask.  Now, he is a strange father,  methinks, to bid his Benjamin, thus apparelled, on a wild goose chase.'    'He could not discount the voices.'    'What voices?'    The boy lifted his face and eyes to the heavens, and lowered them again  with no answer but a sigh of rapture.    'So?  And did the voices bid thee wear a velvet mantlet and roses to thy  shoes?' whispered the girl, with a tiny chuckle.    'They said, \"Not in cockle shells, but a plume, goes the Pilgrim of  Love,\"' answered Bembo.  'As I am and have been, God finds me fitting in  His sight.'    'And the Father Abbot, I wot?'    'Yes: \"Since,\" says he, \"Christ bequeathed His Kingdom to beauty.\"'    'And you have inherited it?  I think I will be your subject, Bernardo.'    'I hope so, Madonna.'    He spoke perfectly gravely, and made her a little courtly gesture  backwards.    'Well,' said she, 'had _I_ been Father Abbot, I had put this pet of my  fancy in a cage.'    'You know not of what you speak,' he answered seriously.  'God works  great ends with little instruments. The puny bee is yet the very fairy  midwife of the forests, I should have broke my heart had he denied me.'    'It would have saved others, alack!'    'What do you mean?'    'Nothing at all.  Will you sing me another parable, Bernardo?'    'Ay, Madonna; and on what subject?  The woman taken in adultery?'    'If you like; and whom Christ forgave.'    '_And He said: \"Go, and sin no more\"_'    She began to weep softly.    'It is shocking to be so abused for a little thing.  I would you were  back with your monks.'    He sighed.    'Ah!' she murmured, still weeping, 'that this bee had been content to  remain a pander to his flowers!  To dup hell's door with a reed!  You  know not to what you have engaged yourself, my poor boy.'    'To Christ, His service of Love,' he said simply.    'Go back, go back!' she cried in pain.  'There are ten thousand  sophisters to interpret that word according to their lusts.  Convert  Galeazzo?  Convert the brimstone lake from burning!  Dost know the  manner of man he is?'    'Else why am I here?'    'Ay, but his moods, his passions, his nameless, shameless deeds?  He  hath no pity but for his desires; no mercy but through his caprices.  To  cross him is to taste the rack, the fire, the living burial.  He is  possessed. Some believe him Caligula reincarnate--an atavism of that  dreadful stock.  And dost think to quench that furnace with a parable?  Unless, indeed--Go back, little Bembo, and waste thy passion for reform  on thy monks.'    'Madonna,' he said, 'I obey the voices.  I shall not be let to perish,  since Christ died to save His world to loveliness.'    It was the early rapture of the renaissance, penetrating like an April  song into these newly reclaimed lands.  The wind blew from Florence, and  all the peaceful vales, so long trodden into a bloody mire, were  awakening to the ecstasy of the _Promise_.  That men interpreted  according to their lights--lights burning fast and passionate in most  places, but in a few quiet and holy.  The breed of German bandits, of  foreign mercenaries, was swept away.  Gone was the whole warring race of  the Visconti, and in its place the peasant Sforza had set a guard about  the land of his fierce adoption, that he might till and graft and  prosper in peace.  Italy had asserted itself the inheritance of its  children, the Court of God's Vicegerent, the chosen land of Love's  gospel.  That, too, men interpreted according to their lights.  'We are  all the vineyard of Rome,' said the little Parablist.  Alas! he thought  Rome the Holy of Holies, and his father a saint.  But his father, who  adored him, had committed him, with his blessing, to this mad romance!  Such were the paradoxes of the Gospel of Love.    Beatrice spoke no more, and they rode on in silence. About evening they  came into a pleasant dell, where there was a level sward among rocks;  and a little stream, running down a stairway of stones, dropped  laughing, like a child going to bed, into the quiet of a rushy pool.  Great chestnuts clothed the slopes, and made a mantle, powdered with  stars, to the setting sun.  It was a very nest for love.    Messer Lanti, halting, commanded the green tents to be pitched on the  grass.  Then, with a stormy scowl and a mockery of courtesy, he came to  dismount his lady.    'Now,' says he, as he got her aside, 'if I do not show thy saint to be a  petticoat, my hug of thee is like to prove a bear's.'    'What!' she said, amazed: 'Bernardo?'    He ground his teeth.    'I do not mark his pink cheeks for nothing.'    'Well, an he be,' she retorted coldly, 'I am liker, than if he be not,  to lose my gallant.'    'That depends,' he growled, 'upon whom your fickleship honours with that  title'; and he strode away, calling roughly to Bembo, 'Art for a bath,  saint, before supper?'    'Why, gladly, Carlo,' said the boy, 'so we may be private.'    They went down to the pool together, and stripped and entered.  Lanti  saw a Ganymede, and was not pleased thereat.  He came to supper in a  very bad humour, which no innocent artifice of his guest could allay.  The kill that day of their falcons--partridges, served in their own  feathers, and stuffed with artichokes and truffles--was tough; the pears  and peaches were sour; the confetti savourless and of stale design.  He  rated his cook, cursed his servitors, and drank more than he ate.  When  the disagreeable meal was ended, he strode ruffling away, saying he  desired his own sole company, which it were well that all should  respect. Bembo saw him go, with a sigh and a smile.    'Good, honest soul,' quoth he, 'that already wakes to the reckoning!'    Madam misunderstood him, and pressed a little closer, with a happy echo  of his sigh.  Her eyes were soft with wine and passion.  She had no  precedent for doubting her influence on the moment she chose to make her  own.    'The reckoning!' she murmured.  'But I am wax in thy hands, pretty  saint.  Shalt confess me, and take what toll thou wilt of my sins?'    Her hand settled light as a bird on his.    'Sing to me, Bernardino,' she whispered wooingly, 'sith the cloud is  gone from our moon, and I am in the will to love.'    He shot one little startled glance her way; then slowly slung round his  lute, and, touching the strings pensively, melted into the following  reproach:--        'Speak low!  What do you ask, false love?  Speak low!        Sin cannot speak too low.      The night-wind stealing to thy bosom,      The dead star, dropping like a blossom,        Less voiceless be than thou!        Low, lower yet, false love, if to confess        What guilt, what shameful need?      God, who can hear the budding grass,      And flake kiss flake in the snowy pass,        Your secret else will heed.        Ah! thou art silent, not from love, but fear,        And true love knows no fear.      Creeping, soft-footed, in the dust,      It is not love, but conscious lust,        Which dreads that God shall hear.'      He rose swiftly beside her, while she sat, dumbly biting a lock of her  own hair.  The frown of outraged passion was in her eyes.  What had the  fool dared in rejecting her!    To touch the perfumed essence of sin with a rebuke which was like a  caress--that, _pace_ his monks, was Bernardo's rendering of the Gospel;  and who shall say that, in its girlish tenderness, its earnest  emotionalism, it was not the most dangerous method of all?  Not every  adulterous woman is fit to meet the gentle fate of Christ's.  It is not  always well to doctor too much kindness with more.  Surfeit, surely, is  not safely cured, unless by a God, with sugar-plums.    'For shame!' he said quietly; 'for shame!  Christ weeps for thee!'    She looked up with a frozen, insolent smile.    'Yet there is no tear in all the night, prophet.'    He raised his hand.  A star trailed down the sky, and disappeared behind  the"]]]
