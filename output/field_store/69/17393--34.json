I never, never, want to see him again,\" and the girl shivered.    \"Don't be alarmed, Dora; I don't think he will dare to show  himself,\" answered Dick, and on the sly gave her hand a tight  squeeze.  They were warmer friends than ever since Dick had  rescued her from those who had abducted her.    The kite-flying was now in \"full blast,\" as Sam expressed it, and  the boys had all they could do to keep the various lines from  becoming tangled up.  His own kite and Fred's were side by side  and for a long time it looked as if neither would mount above the  other.    \"Run her up, Fred!  You can win if you try!\" cried several of the  cadets.    \"Play out a bit more, Sam; you haven't given your kite all the  slack she wants,\" said others.  So the talk ran on, while each  contestant did the best to make his kite mount higher.  In the  meantime the wind kept increasing in violence, making each kite  pull harder than ever.    \"It's a dandy for flying,\" panted Tom, who was holding his kite  with all the strength he possessed.  \"Something must give way  soon,\" and something did give way.  It was the string he was  holding, and as it snapped he went over on his back in such a  comical fashion that all, even to the girls, had to laugh.    \"Torn!  Tom!  What a sight!\" burst out Nellie Laning.  \"You should  have brought a stronger cord.\"    \"If I had I'd a-gone up in the clouds,\" answered Tom ruefully.  \"That's the last of that kite, I suppose; if I--\"    \"The string has caught on Sam's kite!\" interrupted Grace Laning.  \"Oh, my!  See both of them going up!\"    \"Now you can win, Sam!\" laughed Dora.  \"Fred, your flying is  nowhere now.\"    \"He didn't calculate to fly one kite against two,\" answered Fred.  \"Hold on, Sam, where are you going?  The cliff is over in that  direction!\" he yelled suddenly.    \"I--I know it!\" came back the alarming answer.  \"But I can't  stop myself!\"    \"He can't stop himself!\" repeated Dora.    \"Oh, stop him somebody, before he goes over the cliff!\"    \"Let go of the line!\" shouted Dick.  \"Don't go any closer to the  cliff!\"    \"I--I can't let go!  The line is fast around my wrist!\" gasped  poor Sam.  \"Oh, dear, it's cutting me like a knife!\"    \"He's in a mess,\" came from Frank.  \"If he isn't careful he'll go  over the cliff, as sure as he's born!\"    \"Throw yourself down!\" went on Dick, and, leaving his kite in Hans  Mueller's care, he ran after his brother.    By this time Sam had gained a few bushes which grew but a dozen  feet away from the edge of the cliff, that at this point was  nearly forty feet in height.  With his right hand held a painful  prisoner, he clutched at the bushes with his left.    \"I've got the bushes, but I can't hold on long!\" he panted, as  Dick came close.  \"Help me, quick!\"    Scarcely had the words left his mouth when the bushes came up by  the roots and poor Sam fell over on his side.  Then came another  strong puff of wind, and he was dragged to the very edge of the  rocky ledge!    \"I'm going!\" he screamed, when, making a mighty leap, Dick caught  him by the foot.    \"Catch the rock--anything!\" cried the older brother.  \"If you  don't you'll be killed!\"    \"Save me!\" was all poor Sam could say.  \"Oh, Dick, don't let me go  over!\"    \"I'll do my best, Sam,\" was Dick's answer, and he held on like  grim death.    By this time half a dozen boys were running to the scene.  Dora  Stanhope followed, and as she came up she pulled a tiny penknife  from her pocket.    \"Can't I cut the line with this?\" she asked, timidly, as she  pushed her way to Dick's side.    \"Yes, Yes; cut it!\" moaned Sam.  \"Oh, my wrist is almost cut in  two!\"    Stooping low, Dora sawed away at the kite line, which was as taut  as a string on a bass fiddle.  Suddenly there was a loud snap and  the cord parted.  Sam and Dick fell back from the edge of the  cliff, while the entangled kites soared away for parts unknown.    \"Thank Heaven you cut the line, Dora!\" said Dick, who was the  first to recover from the excitement of the situation.  He saw  that Dora was trembling like a leaf, and he hastened to her  support, but she pushed him away and pointed to Sam.    \"Don't mind me--I am all right, Dick,\" she said.  \"Go care for  poor Sam.  See how his wrist is bleeding!  Oh, how dreadful!\"    \"Here is my handkerchief; he had better bind it up with that,\"  said Grace Laning, as she offered the article.    \"We'll wash the wound first,\" put in Frank, and raced off for some  water.  Soon he returned with his stiff hat full, and the cut on  Sam's wrist was tenderly washed by the Laning girls, who then  bound it up with the skill of a hospital surgeon.    The kite-flying continued for the balance of the afternoon.  But  Sam and Dick had had enough of it, and, along with Tom, they took  a stroll along the lake front with Dora Stanhope and Grace and  Nellie.  Of course both boys and girls talked a whole lot of  nonsense, yet all enjoyed the walk very much.    \"This is the spot where they abducted me,\" shivered Dora, as they  came to the old boathouse.  \"Oh, what a dreadful time that was, to  be sure!\"    \"I don't believe our enemies will bother you any more, Dora,\" said  Dick.  \"It's not likely that old Crabtree Will try the same game  twice; and Mumps has really turned over a new leaf and gone to  work for a living.\"    \"Yes, I was glad to hear that, for I don't believe he was such a  bad fellow at heart.  He was under Dan Baxter's influence, just  as--as--\"    \"As Josiah Crabtree tried to influence your mother,\" whispered  Dick, and Dora nodded slowly.  \"Well, let us forget it, and--My  gracious!\"    Dick stopped short, to stare in open-mouthed wonder at a small  boat shooting down the lake at a distance of several hundred yards  from the shore.    \"What's up?\" came simultaneously from Tom and Sam.    \"Don't you see that fellow in the boat?\" demanded Dick, in  increased wonder.    \"Of course we see him,\" answered Tom.    \"Don't you recognize him?\"    \"No; he's too far off,\" came from Sam..    \"It's Dan Baxter!\"    \"Baxter!\" cried Dora.  \"Oh, Dick!\"    \"Nonsense!\" said Tom.  \"How could he be am here?\"    \"It does look a little like Baxter,\" was Sam's slow comment.  \"Yet  it seems impossible that he could be here, as Tom says.\"    \"I say it's Baxter,\" affirmed Dick stoutly,  \"I'll hail him and  make sure.\"    \"Oh, don't bring him over here!\" interposed Dora, becoming  alarmed.    \"Don't be alarmed--he shan't hurt anybody, Dora.\" Dick raised  his voice.  \"Hi there, Baxter!  What are you doing here?\"    At first there was no reply, and the boy in the rowboat kept on  pulling.  But as Dick repeated his call, the rower threw up his  oars.    \"You mind your own business,\" he growled.  \"Guess I can row on the  lake if I want to.\"    \"It is Baxter, sure enough!\" ejaculated Tom.    \"The rascal!  We ought to recapture him.\"    \"That's the talk,\" added Sam.  \"I wish my wrist wasn't so sore--I'd  go after him.\"    \"There's a boat below here,\" said Dick.    \"Let's put out in that.\"    \"He may--may shoot at you,\" faltered Dora.  \"You know how wicked  he can be at times.\"    \"Indeed I do know,\" answered Dick.  \"But he ought to be handed  over to the authorities.  It is a crime to let him go free.\"    \"Hi, Baxter.  Come over here; we want to talk to you!\" yelled Tom.    \"Not much!\" growled the former bully of Putnam Hall.    \"You had better come,\" said Sam.  \"If you don't come we'll bring  you.\"    \"Hush, Sam, or you'll make a mess of things!\" cried Dick softly,  but the warning came too late.    \"Will you bring me back?\" roared the bully.  \"Just try it on and  see how I'll fix you.\"    \"Come on for the boat,\" said Tom.  \"We'll show him he can't scare  us.\"    He started off and Dick came after him.  Sam was also about to  follow, when his elder brother stopped him.    \"You can't do much with that sore wrist, Sam,\" he said.  \"Better  stay with the girls until we come back.  You can watch events from  the shore, and run for assistance, if it's necessary.\"    Sam demurred at first, but soon saw the wisdom of  Dick's  reasoning and consented to remain behind.    By this time Tom had shoved out the rowboat Dick had mentioned--a  neat craft belonging to a farmer living near.  A pair of oars  lay in a locker on the lake bank; and, securing these, Tom leaped  on board of the craft, and soon Dick came after.    Dan Baxter had watched their movement with interest, which  speedily gave way to arm when he saw the other boat come out, and  beheld Dick and Tom each take up an oar and begin to pull for all  they could.    \"I was a clam to come up here, when there  is no real need for  it,\" he muttered.  \"Two to one, eh?  Well, I reckon I can put up a  pretty stiff fight if it comes to the worst.\" Then he caught up  his oars once more, and began to row down Cayuga Lake with all  possible speed.          CHAPTER IV    THE CHASE ON THE LAKE      \"He means to give us as much of a chase as possible,\" remarked  Tom, as he glanced over his shoulder.  \"If I remember rightly,  Baxter was always a pretty fair oarsman.\"    \"Yes, that was the one thing he could do well,\" returned Dick.  \"But we ought to be able to catch him, Tom.\"    \"We could if we had two pairs of oars.  One pair can do just about  so much and no more.\"    \"Nonsense!  Now, both together, and put all your muscle into it,\"  and Dick set a stiff stroke that his brother followed with  difficulty.    Baxter had been rowing down the lake, but as soon as he saw that  he was being pursued he changed his course for the east shore.  He  was settled to his work, and for several minutes it was hard to  tell whether he was holding his own or losing.    \"Hurrah! we are catching up!\" cried Dick, after pulling for five  minutes.  \"Keep at it, Tom, and we'll have him before he is half  over.\"    \"Gosh, but it's hot work!\" came with a pant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5780"],[0,"The Rover Boys at School; Or, The Cadets of Putnam Hall (#3)"],[1,"here,\" observed Tom, and just then sank up to  his ankles in water and mud.  But the tramp could now be seen  heading directly for the river, and they continued to follow him.    They were still fifty yards from the shore when Sam uttered a cry  of dismay.  \"He's got a boat!\"    \"So he has.  Stop there, you thief!\"    \"Stop yourself, or I'll shoot one of you!\" growled the tramp, as  he leaped into a flat bottom craft moored beside a fallen tree.  He had no pistol, but thought he might scare the boys.    They came to a halt, and an instant later the flat-bottom craft  shot away from the river bank.  By this time Dick came up, all out  of breath.    \"So he has gotten away!\" he cried in dismay.    \"Yes,\" answered Sam, \"but here is your pocketbook.\"    \"And what of my watch--the one father gave to me before he left  for Africa?\"    \"He's got that yet, I suppose,\" said Tom.    At this Dick gave a groan, for the watch was a fine gold one which  Mr. Rover had worn for years.  Dick had begged for the timepiece,  and it had been entrusted to him at the last moment.    \"We must get that watch back somehow!\" he said.  \"Isn't there  another boat around here?\"    \"There is one up to Harrison's farm.\"    \"That is quarter of a mile away.\"    \"I don't think there is any nearer.\"    \"And the river is all of two hundred feet wide here!  What shall  we do?\"    It was a puzzling question, and all three of the boys stared  blankly at each other.  In the meantime, the thief had picked up a  pair of oars and was using them in a clumsy fashion which showed  plainly that he was not used to handling them.    \"If we had a boat we could catch him easily,\" observed Tom.  Then  his eyes fell upon the fallen tree.  \"I have an idea!  Let us try  to get across on that!  I won't mind a wetting if only we can get  Dick's watch back.\"    \"Yes, yes; just the thing!\" put in his elder brother quickly.    All hands ran down to the fallen tree, which was about a foot in  diameter and not over twenty-five or thirty feet in length.  It  lay half in the water already, and it was an easy matter to shove  it off.    \"We can't do much without oars or a pole,\" said Tom.  \"Wait a  moment,\" and he ran back to where he had seen another fallen tree,  a tall, slender maple sapling.  He soon had this in hand; and,  cleared of its branches, it made a capital pole.  Dick and Sam sat  astride of the tree in the water, and Tom stood against an upright  branch and shoved off.  The river was not deep, and he kept on  reaching bottom without difficulty.    By this time the tramp was halfway across the stream, which was  flowing, rapidly and carrying both boat and tree down toward a  bend quarter of a mile below.    \"Go on back, unless you want to be shot!\" cried the man savagely,  but they paid no attention to the threat as no pistol appeared;  and, seeing this, the thief redoubled his efforts to get away.    He was still a quarter of the distance from the opposite shore,  and the boys on the tree were in midstream, when Sam uttered a  shout.  \"There goes one of his oars!  We can catch him now--if  we try hard!\"    It was true that the oar was gone, and in his anxiety to regain  the blade the tramp nearly lost the second oar.  But his efforts  were unavailing, and he started to paddle himself to the bank,  meanwhile watching his pursuers anxiously.    \"We'll get him,\" said Dick encouragingly, when, splash! Tom went  overboard like a flash, the lower end of his pole having slipped  on a smooth rock of the river bottom.  There was a grand splutter,  and it was fully a minute before Tom reappeared--twenty feet  away and minus his pole.    \"Hi! help me on board, somebody!\" he spluttered, for he had gone  overboard so quickly that he had swallowed a large quantity of  water.    Both Sam and Dick tried to reach him, but could not.  Then the  current caught the tree and whirled it around and around until  both boys began to grow dizzy.    Seeing they could not aid him, and getting back a little of his  wind, Tom struck out for the tree.  But the water running over his  face blinded him, and ere he knew he was so close the tree came  circling around and struck him on the side of the head.    \"Oh!\" he moaned, and sank from sight.    \"Tom's hit!\" gasped Sam.  \"He'll be drowned sure now!\"    \"Not if I can help him!\" burst out Dick, and leaped overboard to  his brother's assistance.  But Tom was still out of sight, and for  several seconds could not be located.    Sam waited anxiously, half of a mind to jump into the river  himself.  The tramp was now forgotten, and landed on the opposite  bank unnoticed.  He immediately dove into the bushes, and  disappeared from view.    At last Dick caught sight of Tom's arm and made a clutch for it.  Hardly had he taken hold than Tom swung around and caught him by  the throat in a deathlike grip, for he was too bewildered to know  what he was doing.    \"Save me!\" he groaned.  \"Oh, my head!  Save me!\"    \"I will, Tom; only don't hold me so tight,\" answered Dick. \"I--can't  get any air.\"    \"I can't swim--I'm all upset,\" was the reply; and Tom clutched  his elder brother tighter than ever.    Seeing there was no help for it, Dick caught hold of the fingers  around his throat and forced them loose by main force.  Then he  swung himself behind Tom and caught him under the arms, in the  meantime treading water to keep both of them afloat.    \"Sam, can't you bring that tree closer?\" he called out.    There was no reply, and, looking around, he saw that the tree and  his younger brother were a hundred yards away, and sailing down  the river as rapidly as the increasing current could, carry them  for quarter of a mile below were what were known as the Humpback  Falls--a series of dangerous rapids through which but few boats  had ever passed without serious mishap.    \"I reckon Sam is having his hands full,\" he thought.  \"I must get  Tom to the shore alone.  But it is going to be a tough job, I can  see that.\"    \"Oh, Dick!\" came from Tom.  \"My head is spinning like a top!\"    \"The tree hit you, Tom.  But do keep quiet, and I'll take care of  you.\"    \"I can't swim--I feel like a wet rag through and through.\"    \"Never mind about swimming.  Only don't catch me by the throat  again, and we'll be all right,\" was Dick's reassuring reply, and  as his brother became more passive he struck out for the bank upon  which the thief had landed.    The current carried them on and on, but not so swiftly as it was  carrying the tree.  Soon they were approaching the bend.  Dick was  swimming manfully, but was  now all but exhausted.    \"You can't make it, Dick,\" groaned Tom.  \"Better save yourself.\"    \"And let you go?  No indeed, Tom.  I have a little strength left  and--Hurrah, I've struck bottom!\"    Dick was right: his feet had landed on a sandbar; and, standing  up, both boys found the water only to their armpits.  Under such  circumstances they waded ashore with care, and here threw  themselves down to rest.    \"That thief is gone,\" said Dick dismally.    \"And my watch too!\"    \"But where is Sam?\" questioned Tom, then looked at his brother  meaningfully.    \"The Humpback Fall!\" came from Dick.  \"Sam!  Sam!\" he yelled;  \"look out where you are going!\"    But no answer came back to his cry, for Sam had long since floated  out of hearing.          CHAPTER III    SAMS ADVENTURE AT HUMPBACK FALLS      For several minutes after Dick leaped overboard to Tom's  assistance, Sam's one thought was of his two brothers.  Would they  reach the tree or the shore in safety?  Fervently he prayed they  would.    The tree went around and around, as a side current caught it, and  presently the whirlings became so rapid that Sam grew dizzy, and  had to hold tight to keep from falling off.    He saw Dick catch Tom from the back and start for shore, and then  like a flash the realization of his own situation dawned upon him.  He was on the tree with no means of guiding his improvised craft,  and sweeping nearer and nearer to the rapids of which he had heard  so much but really knew so little.    \"I must get this tree to the river bank,\" he, said to himself, and  looked around for some limb which might be cut off and used for a  pole.    But no such limb was handy, and even had there been there would  have been no time in which to prepare it for use, for the rapids  were now in plain sight, the water boiling and foaming as it  darted over one rock and another, in a descent of thirty feet in  forty yards.    \"This won't do!\" muttered the boy, and wondered if it would not be  best to leap overboard and try to swim to safety.  But one look at  that swirling current made  him draw back.    \"I reckon I had best stick to the tree and trust to luck to pass  the rocks in safety,\" he muttered, and clutched the tree with a  firmer hold than ever.    The strange craft had now stopped circling, and was shooting  straight ahead for a rock that stood several feet above water.  On  it went, and Sam closed his eyes in expectancy of an awful shock  which would pitch him headlong, he knew not to where.    But then came a swerve to the left, and the tree grated along the  edge of the rock.  Before Sam could recover his breath, down it  went over the first line of rapids.  Here it stuck fast for a  moment, then turned over and went on, throwing Sam on the under  side.    The boy's feet struck bottom, and he bobbed up like a cork.  Again  he clutched the tree, and on the two went a distance of ten feet  further.  But now the tree became jammed between two other rocks,  and there it stuck, with Sam clutching one end and the water  rushing in, a torrent over the other.    For the moment the boy could do little but hold fast, but as his  breath came back to him he climbed on top of the tree and took a  look at the situation.    It was truly a dismaying one.  He was in the very center of the  rapids, and the shore on either side of him was fifty to sixty  feet away.    \"How am I ever to get to the bank?\""]]]
