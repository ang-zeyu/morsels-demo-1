Into his degenerate mind had stolen the darkling and criminal thought  that he--Audacious Scoundrel--might impose upon me by pretending he was  not merely \"a robin\" but \"The Robin\"--Tweetie himself and that he might  supplant him in my affections. But he had been confounded and cast into  outer darkness and again we were One.    I will not attempt to deceive. He was jealous beyond bounds. It was  necessary for me to be most discreet in my demeanor towards the head  gardener with whom I was obliged to consult frequently. When he came  into the rose-garden for orders Tweetie at once appeared.    He followed us, hopping in the grass or from rose bush to rose bush. No  word of ours escaped him. If our conversation on the enthralling  subjects of fertilizers and aphides seemed in its earnest absorption to  verge upon the emotional and tender he interfered at once. He commanded  my attention. He perched on nearby boughs and endeavored to distract me.  He fluttered about and called me with chirps. His last resource was  always to fly to the topmost twig of an apple tree and begin to sing his  most brilliant song in his most thrilling tone and with an affected  manner. Naturally we were obliged to listen and talk about him. Even old  Barton's weather-beaten apple face would wrinkle into smiles.    \"He's doin' that to make us look at him,\" he would say. \"That's what  he's doin' it for. He can't abide not to be noticed.\"    But it was not only his vanity which drew him to me. He loved me. The  low song trilled in his little pulsating scarlet throat was mine. He  sang it only to me--and he would never sing it when any one else was  there to hear. When we were quite alone with only roses and bees and  sunshine and silence about us, when he swung on some spray quite close  to me and I stood and talked to him in whispers--then he would answer  me--each time I paused--with the little \"far away\" sounding trills--the  sweetest, most wonderful little sounds in the world. A clever person who  knew more of the habits of birds than I did told me a most curious  thing.    \"That is his little mating song,\" he said. \"You have inspired a hopeless  passion in a robin.\"    Perhaps so. He thought the rose-garden was the world and it seemed to me  he never went out of it during the summer months. At whatsoever hour I  appeared and called him he came out of bushes but from a different point  each time. In late autumn however, one afternoon I SAW him fly to me  from over a wall dividing the enclosed garden from the open ones. I  thought he looked guilty and fluttered when he alighted near me. I think  he did not want me to know.    \"You have been making the acquaintance of a young lady robin,\" I said to  him. \"Perhaps you are already engaged to her for the next season.\"    He tried to persuade me that it was not true but I felt he was not  entirely frank.    After that it was plain that he had discovered that the rose-garden was  not ALL the world. He knew about the other side of the wall. But it did  not absorb him altogether. He was seldom absent when I came and he never  failed to answer my call. I talked to him often about the young lady  robin but though he showed a gentlemanly reticence on the subject I knew  quite well he loved me best. He loved my robin sounds, he loved my  whispers, his dewy dark eyes looked into mine as if he knew we two  understood strange tender things others did not.    I was only a mere tenant of the beautiful place I had had for nine years  and that winter the owner sold the estate. In December I was to go to  Montreux for a couple of months; in March I was to return to Maytham and  close it before leaving it finally. Until I left for Switzerland I saw  my robin every day. Before I went away I called him to me and told him  where I was going.    He was such a little thing. Two or three months might seem a lifetime to  him. He might not remember me so long. I was not a real robin. I was  only a human being. I said a great many things to him--wondering if he  would even be in the garden when I came back. I went away wondering.    When I returned from the world of winter sports, of mountain snows, of  tobogganing and skis I felt as if I had been absent a long time. There  had been snow even in Kent and the park and gardens were white. I  arrived in the evening. The next morning I threw on my red frieze garden  cloak and went down the flagged terrace and the Long Walk through the  walled gardens to the beloved place where the rose bushes stood dark and  slender and leafless among the whiteness. I went to my own tree and  stood under it and called.    \"Are you gone,\" I said in my heart; \"are you gone, little Soul? Shall I  never see you again?\"    After the call I waited--and I had never waited before. The roses were  gone and he was not in the rose-world. I called again. The call was  sometimes a soft whistle as near a robin sound as I could make  it--sometimes it was a chirp--sometimes it was a quick clear repetition  of \"Sweet! Sweet! Sweetie\"--which I fancied he liked best. I made one  after the other--and then--something scarlet flashed across the lawn,  across the rose-walk--over the wall and he was there. He had not  forgotten, it had not been too long, he alighted on the snowy brown  grass at my feet.    Then I knew he was a little Soul and not only a bird and the real  parting which must come in a few weeks' time loomed up before me a  strange tragic thing.    * * *    I do not often allow myself to think of it. It was too final. And there  was nothing to be done. I was going thousands of miles across the sea. A  little warm thing of scarlet and brown feathers and pulsating trilling  throat lives such a brief life. The little soul in its black dew-drop  eye--one knows nothing about it. For myself I sometimes believe strange  things. We two were something weirdly near to each other.    At the end I went down to the bare world of roses one soft damp day and  stood under the tree and called him for the last time. He did not keep  me waiting and he flew to a twig very near my face. I could not write  all I said to him. I tried with all my heart to explain and he answered  me--between his listenings--with the \"far away\" love note. I talked to  him as if he knew all I knew. He put his head on one side and listened  so intently that I felt that he understood. I told him that I must go  away and that we should not see each other again and I told him why.    \"But you must not think when I do not come back it is because I have  forgotten you,\" I said. \"Never since I was born have I loved anything as  I have loved you--except my two babies.  Never shall I love anything so  much again so long as I am in the world. You are a little Soul and I am a  little Soul and we shall love each other forever and ever. We won't say  Good-bye. We have been too near to each other--nearer than human  beings are. I love you and love you and love you--little Soul.\"    Then I went out of the rose-garden. I shall never go into it again."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5307"],[0,"The Letters of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart â€” Volume 01 (#3)"],[1,"day to dry the tears he shed  for you! He no doubt, too, swallowed at least three ounces of cream of  tartar to drive away the horrid evil humors in his body. I know nothing  new except that Herr Gellert, the Leipzig poet, [Footnote: Old Mozart  prized Gellert's poems so highly, that on one occasion he wrote to him  expressing his admiration.] is dead, and has written no more poetry  since his death. Just before beginning this letter I composed an air  from the \"Demetrio\" of Metastasio, which begins thus, \"Misero tu non  sei.\"    The opera at Mantua was very good. They gave \"Demetrio.\" The prima donna  sings well, but is inanimate, and if you did not see her acting, but  only singing, you might suppose she was not singing at all, for she  can't open her mouth, and whines out everything; but this is nothing new  to us. The seconda donna looks like a grenadier, and has a very powerful  voice; she really does not sing badly, considering that this is her  first appearance. Il primo uomo, il musico, sings beautifully, but his  voice is uneven; his name is Caselli. Il secondo uomo is quite old, and  does not at all please me. The tenor's name is Ottini; he does not sing  unpleasingly, but with effort, like all Italian tenors. We know him  very well. The name of the second I don't know; he is still young, but  nothing at all remarkable. Primo ballerino good; prima ballerina good,  and people say pretty, but I have not seen her near. There is a grotesco  who jumps cleverly, but cannot write as I do--just as pigs grunt.  The orchestra is tolerable. In Cremona, the orchestra is good, and  Spagnoletta is the name of the first violinist there. Prima donna very  passable--rather ancient, I fancy, and as ugly as sin. She does not sing  as well as she acts, and is the wife of a violin-player at the opera.  Her name is Masci. The opera was the \"Clemenza di Tito.\" Seconda donna  not ugly on the stage, young, but nothing superior. Primo uomo, un  musico, Cicognani, a fine voice, and a beautiful cantabile. The other  two musici young and passable. The tenor's name is non lo so [I don't  know what]. He has a pleasing exterior, and resembles Le Roi at Vienna.  Ballerino primo good, but an ugly dog. There was a ballerina who danced  far from badly, and, what is a capo d'opera, she is anything but plain,  either on the stage or off it. The rest were the usual average. I cannot  write much about the Milan opera, for we did not go there, but we heard  that it was not successful. Primo uomo, Aprile, who sings well, and  has a fine even voice; we heard him at a grand church festival. Madame  Piccinelli, from Paris, who sang at one of our concerts, acts at the  opera. Herr Pick, who danced at Vienna, is now dancing here. The opera  is \"Didone abbandonata,\" but it is not to be given much longer. Signor  Piccini, who is writing the next opera, is here. I am told that the  title is to be \"Cesare in Egitto.\"    WOLFGANG DE MOZART,    Noble of Hohenthal and attached to the Exchequer.        4.    Milan, Feb. 10, 1770.

DE MORZANTINI.        5.    Milan, Feb. 17, 1770.    Now I am in for it! My Mariandel! I am so glad that you were so  tremendously merry. Say to nurse Urserl that I still think I sent back  all her songs, but if, engrossed by high and mighty thoughts of Italy,  I carried one off with me, I shall not fail, if I find it, to enclose it  in one of my letters. Addio, my children, farewell! I kiss mamma's hands  a thousand times, and send you a thousand kisses and salutes on your  queer monkey face. Per fare il fine, I am yours, &c.        6.    Milan, Carnival, Erchtag.    MANY kisses to mamma and to you. I am fairly crazed with so much  business, [Footnote: Concerts and compositions of every kind occupied  Mozart. The principal result of his stay in Milan was, that the young  maestro got the scrittura of an opera for the ensuing season. As the  libretto was to be sent to them, they could first make a journey through  Italy with easy minds. The opera was \"Mitridate, Re di Ponto.\"] so I  can't possibly write any more.        7.    Milan, March 3, 1770.    CARA SORELLA MIA,--    I am heartily glad that you have had so much amusement. Perhaps you may  think that I have not been as merry as you; but, indeed, I cannot sum  up all we have done. I think we have been at least six or seven times at  the opera and the feste di ballo, which, as in Vienna, begin after the  opera, but with this difference, that at Vienna the dancing is more  orderly. We also saw the facchinata and chiccherata. The first is  a masquerade, an amusing sight, because the men go as facchini, or  porters; there was also a barca filled with people, and a great number  on foot besides; and five or six sets of trumpets and kettledrums,  besides several bands of violins and other instruments. The chiccherata  is also a masquerade. What the people of Milan call chicchere, we call  petits maitres, or fops. They were all on horseback, which was a pretty  sight. I am as happy now to hear that Herr von Aman [Footnote: The  father had written in a previous letter, \"Herr von Aman's accident,  of which you wrote to us, not only distressed us very much, but cost  Wolfgang many tears. You know how sensitive he is\"] is better, as I was  grieved when you mentioned that he had met with an accident. What  kind of mask did Madame Rosa wear, and Herr von Molk, and Herr von  Schiedenhofen? Pray write this to me, if you know it; your doing so will  oblige me very much. Kiss mamma's hands for me a thousand million times,  and a thousand to yourself from \"Catch him who can!\" Why, here he is!        8.    Bologna, March 24, 1770.    Oh, you busy creature!    Having been so long idle, I thought it would do me no harm to set to  work again for a short time. On the post-days, when the German letters  come, all that I eat and drink tastes better than usual. I beg you will  let me know who are to sing in the oratorio, and also its title. Let me  hear how you like the Haydn minuets, and whether they are better than  the first. From my heart I rejoice to hear that Herr von Aman is now  quite recovered; pray say to him that he must take great care of himself  and beware of any unusual exertion. Be sure you tell him this. I intend  shortly to send you a minuet that Herr Pick danced on the stage, and  which every one in Milan was dancing at the feste di ballo, only  that you may see by it how slowly people dance. The minuet itself is  beautiful. Of course it comes from Vienna, so no doubt it is either  Teller's or Starzer's. It has a great many notes. Why? Because it is a  theatrical minuet, which is in slow time. The Milan and Italian minuets,  however, have a vast number of notes, and are slow and with a quantity  of bars; for instance, the first part has sixteen, the second twenty,  and even twenty-four.    We made the acquaintance of a singer in Parma, and also heard her to  great advantage in her own house--I mean the far-famed Bastardella. She  has, first, a fine voice; second, a flexible organ; third, an incredibly  high compass. She sang the following notes and passages in my presence.    [Here, Mozart illustrates with about 20 measures of music]        9.    Rome, April 14, 1770.    I AM thankful to say that my stupid pen and I are all right, so we send  a thousand kisses to you both. I wish that my sister were in Rome,  for this city would assuredly delight her, because St. Peter's is  symmetrical, and many other things in Rome are also symmetrical. Papa  has just told me that the loveliest flowers are being carried past at  this moment. That I am no wiseacre is pretty well known.    Oh! I have one annoyance--there is only a single bed in our lodgings,  so mamma may easily imagine that I get no rest beside papa. I rejoice at  the thoughts of a new lodging. I have just finished sketching St. Peter  with his keys, St. Paul with his sword, and St. Luke with--my sister,  &c., &c. I had the honor of kissing St. Peter's foot at San Pietro, and  as I have the misfortune to be so short, your good old    WOLFGANG MOZART    was lifted up!        10.    Rome, April 21, 1770.    CARA SORELLA MIA,--    Pray try to find the \"Art of Ciphering\" which you copied out, but I have  lost it, and know nothing about it. So pray do write it out again for  me, with some other copies of sums, and send them to me here.    Manzuoli has entered into a contract with the Milanese to sing in my  opera [see Nos. 2-6]. For this reason he sang four or five arias to me  in Florence, and also some of my own, which I was obliged to compose in  Milan (none of my theatrical things having been heard there) to prove  that I was capable of writing an opera. Manzuoli asks 1000 ducats. It is  not yet quite certain whether Gabrielli will come. Some say Madame de'  Amicis will sing in it; we shall see her in Naples. I wish that she and  Manzuoli could act together; we should then be sure of two good friends.  The libretto is not yet chosen. I recommended one of Metastasio's to Don  Ferdinando [Count Firmiani's steward, in Milan] and to Herr von Troyer.  I am at this moment at work on the aria \"Se ardore e speranza.\"        11.    Rome, April 25, 1770.    CARA SORELLA MIA,--    Io vi accerto che io aspetto con una incredibile premura tutte le  giornate di posta qualche lettere di Salisburgo. Jeri fummo a S.
