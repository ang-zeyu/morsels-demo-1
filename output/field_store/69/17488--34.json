Men of learning display  their various knowledge of the institutes in commenting on the composition.  Some are skilful in explaining it, while others, in remembering its  contents.    \"The son of Satyavati having, by penance and meditation, analysed the  eternal Veda, afterwards composed this holy history, when that learned  Brahmarshi of strict vows, the noble Dwaipayana Vyasa, offspring of  Parasara, had finished this greatest of narrations, he began to consider  how he might teach it to his disciples. And the possessor of the six  attributes, Brahma, the world's preceptor, knowing of the anxiety of the  Rishi Dwaipayana, came in person to the place where the latter was, for  gratifying the saint, and benefiting the people. And when Vyasa,  surrounded by all the tribes of Munis, saw him, he was surprised; and,  standing with joined palms, he bowed and ordered a seat to be brought. And  Vyasa having gone round him who is called Hiranyagarbha seated on that  distinguished seat stood near it; and being commanded by Brahma  Parameshthi, he sat down near the seat, full of affection and smiling in  joy. Then the greatly glorious Vyasa, addressing Brahma Parameshthi, said,  'O divine Brahma, by me a poem hath been composed which is greatly  respected. The mystery of the Veda, and what other subjects have been  explained by me; the various rituals of the Upanishads with the Angas; the  compilation of the Puranas and history formed by me and named after the  three divisions of time, past, present, and future; the determination of  the nature of decay, fear, disease, existence, and non-existence, a  description of creeds and of the various modes of life; rule for the four  castes, and the import of all the Puranas; an account of asceticism and of  the duties of a religious student; the dimensions of the sun and moon, the  planets, constellations, and stars, together with the duration of the four  ages; the Rik, Sama and Yajur Vedas; also the Adhyatma; the sciences  called Nyaya, Orthoephy and Treatment of diseases; charity and  Pasupatadharma; birth celestial and human, for particular purposes; also a  description of places of pilgrimage and other holy places of rivers,  mountains, forests, the ocean, of heavenly cities and the kalpas; the art  of war; the different kinds of nations and languages: the nature of the  manners of the people; and the all-pervading spirit;--all these have been  represented. But, after all, no writer of this work is to be found on  earth.'    \"Brahma said, 'I esteem thee for thy knowledge of divine mysteries, before  the whole body of celebrated Munis distinguished for the sanctity of their  lives. I know thou hast revealed the divine word, even from its first  utterance, in the language of truth. Thou hast called thy present work a  poem, wherefore it shall be a poem. There shall be no poets whose works  may equal the descriptions of this poem, even, as the three other modes  called Asrama are ever unequal in merit to the domestic Asrama. Let Ganesa  be thought of, O Muni, for the purpose of writing the poem.'\"    Sauti said, \"Brahma having thus spoken to Vyasa, retired to his own abode.  Then Vyasa began to call to mind Ganesa. And Ganesa, obviator of obstacles,  ready to fulfil the desires of his votaries, was no sooner thought of,  than he repaired to the place where Vyasa was seated. And when he had been  saluted, and was seated, Vyasa addressed him thus, 'O guide of the Ganas!  be thou the writer of the Bharata which I have formed in my imagination,  and which I am about to repeat.'    \"Ganesa, upon hearing this address, thus answered, 'I will become the  writer of thy work, provided my pen do not for a moment cease writing.'  And Vyasa said unto that divinity, 'Wherever there be anything thou dost  not comprehend, cease to continue writing.' Ganesa having signified his  assent, by repeating the word Om! proceeded to write; and Vyasa began; and  by way of diversion, he knit the knots of composition exceeding close; by  doing which, he dictated this work according to his engagement.    \"I am\" (continued Sauti) \"acquainted with eight thousand and eight hundred  verses, and so is Suka, and perhaps Sanjaya. From the mysteriousness of  their meaning, O Muni, no one is able, to this day, to penetrate those  closely knit difficult slokas. Even the omniscient Ganesa took a moment to  consider; while Vyasa, however, continued to compose other verses in great  abundance.    \"The wisdom of this work, like unto an instrument of applying collyrium,  hath opened the eyes of the inquisitive world blinded by the darkness of  ignorance. As the sun dispelleth the darkness, so doth the Bharata by its  discourses on religion, profit, pleasure and final release, dispel the  ignorance of men. As the full-moon by its mild light expandeth the buds of  the water-lily, so this Purana, by exposing the light of the Sruti hath  expanded the human intellect. By the lamp of history, which destroyeth the  darkness of ignorance, the whole mansion of nature is properly and  completely illuminated.    \"This work is a tree, of which the chapter of contents is the seed; the  divisions called Pauloma and Astika are the root; the part called Sambhava  is the trunk; the books called Sabha and Aranya are the roosting perches;  the books called Arani is the knitting knots; the books called Virata and  Udyoga the pith; the book named Bhishma, the main branch; the book called  Drona, the leaves; the book called Karna, the fair flowers; the book named  Salya, their sweet smell; the books entitled Stri and Aishika, the  refreshing shade; the book called Santi, the mighty fruit; the book called  Aswamedha, the immortal sap; the book denominated Asramavasika, the spot  where it groweth; and the book called Mausala, is an epitome of the Vedas  and held in great respect by the virtuous Brahmanas. The tree of the  Bharata, inexhaustible to mankind as the clouds, shall be as a source of  livelihood to all distinguished poets.\"    Sauti continued, \"I will now speak of the undying flowery and fruitful  productions of this tree, possessed of pure and pleasant taste, and not to  be destroyed even by the immortals. Formerly, the spirited and virtuous  Krishna-Dwaipayana, by the injunctions of Bhishma, the wise son of Ganga  and of his own mother, became the father of three boys who were like the  three fires by the two wives of Vichitra-virya; and having thus raised up  Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidura, he returned to his recluse abode to  prosecute his religious exercise.    \"It was not till after these were born, grown up, and departed on the  supreme journey, that the great Rishi Vyasa published the Bharata in this  region of mankind; when being solicited by Janamejaya and thousands of  Brahmanas, he instructed his disciple Vaisampayana, who was seated near  him; and he, sitting together with the Sadasyas, recited the Bharata,  during the intervals of the ceremonies of the sacrifice, being repeatedly  urged to proceed.    \"Vyasa hath fully represented the greatness of the house of Kuru, the  virtuous principles of Gandhari, the wisdom of Vidura, and the constancy  of Kunti. The noble Rishi hath also described the divinity of Vasudeva,  the rectitude of the sons of Pandu, and the evil practices of the sons and  partisans of Dhritarashtra.    \"Vyasa executed the compilation of the Bharata, exclusive of the episodes  originally in twenty-four thousand verses; and so much only is called by  the learned as the Bharata. Afterwards, he composed an epitome in one  hundred and fifty verses, consisting of the introduction with the chapter  of contents. This he first taught to his son Suka; and afterwards he gave  it to others of his disciples who were possessed of the same  qualifications. After that he executed another compilation, consisting of  six hundred thousand verses. Of those, thirty hundred thousand are known  in the world of the Devas; fifteen hundred thousand in the world of the  Pitris: fourteen hundred thousand among the Gandharvas, and one hundred  thousand in the regions of mankind. Narada recited them to the Devas,  Devala to the Pitris, and Suka published them to the Gandharvas, Yakshas,  and Rakshasas: and in this world they were recited by Vaisampayana, one of  the disciples of Vyasa, a man of just principles and the first among all  those acquainted with the Vedas. Know that I, Sauti, have also repeated  one hundred thousand verses.    \"Yudhishthira is a vast tree, formed of religion and virtue; Arjuna is its  trunk; Bhimasena, its branches; the two sons of Madri are its full-grown  fruit and flowers; and its roots are Krishna, Brahma, and the Brahmanas.    \"Pandu, after having subdued many countries by his wisdom and prowess, took  up his abode with the Munis in a certain forest as a sportsman, where he  brought upon himself a very severe misfortune for having killed a stag  coupling with its mate, which served as a warning for the conduct of the  princes of his house as long as they lived. Their mothers, in order that  the ordinances of the law might be fulfilled, admitted as substitutes to  their embraces the gods Dharma, Vayu, Sakra, and the divinities the twin  Aswins. And when their offspring grew up, under the care of their two  mothers, in the society of ascetics, in the midst of sacred groves and  holy recluse-abodes of religious men, they were conducted by Rishis into  the presence of Dhritarashtra and his sons, following as students in the  habit of Brahmacharis, having their hair tied in knots on their heads.  'These our pupils', said they, 'are as your sons, your brothers, and your  friends; they are Pandavas.' Saying this, the Munis disappeared.    \"When the Kauravas saw them introduced as the sons of Pandu, the  distinguished class of citizens shouted exceedingly for joy. Some, however,  said, they were not the sons of Pandu; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7871"],[0,"Dutch Fairy Tales for Young Folks (#3)"],[1,"until the sky in the east  began to turn, first gray and then rosy. Then he tumbled down, tired  out, and fell asleep. His head lay on the inner curve of the fairy ring,  with his feet in the centre.    Klaas felt very happy, for he had no sense of being tired, and he did  not know he was asleep. He thought his fairy partners, who had danced  with him, were now waiting on him to bring him cheeses. With a golden  knife, they sliced them off and fed him out of their own hands. How good  it tasted! He thought now he could, and would, eat all the cheese he had  longed for all his life. There was no mother to scold him, or daddy to  shake his finger at him. How delightful!    But by and by, he wanted to stop eating and rest a while. His jaws were  tired. His stomach seemed to be loaded with cannon-balls. He gasped for  breath.    But the fairies would not let him stop, for Dutch fairies never get  tired. Flying out of the sky--from the north, south, east and west--they  came, bringing cheeses. These they dropped down around him, until the  piles of the round masses threatened first to enclose him as with a  wall, and then to overtop him. There were the red balls from Edam, the  pink and yellow spheres from Gouda, and the gray loaf-shaped ones from  Leyden. Down through the vista of sand, in the pine woods, he looked,  and oh, horrors! There were the tallest and strongest of the fairies  rolling along the huge, round, flat cheeses from Friesland! Any one of  these was as big as a cart wheel, and would feed a regiment. The fairies  trundled the heavy discs along, as if they were playing with hoops. They  shouted hilariously, as, with a pine stick, they beat them forward like  boys at play. Farm cheese, factory cheese, Alkmaar cheese, and, to crown  all, cheese from Limburg--which Klaas never could bear, because of its  strong odor. Soon the cakes and balls were heaped so high around him  that the boy, as he looked up, felt like a frog in a well. He groaned  when he thought the high cheese walls were tottering to fall on him.  Then he screamed, but the fairies thought he was making music. They, not  being human, do not know how a boy feels.    At last, with a thick slice in one hand and a big hunk in the other, he  could eat no more cheese; though the fairies, led by their queen,  standing on one side, or hovering over his head, still urged him to take  more.    At this moment, while afraid that he would burst, Klaas saw the pile of  cheeses, as big as a house, topple over. The heavy mass fell inwards  upon him. With a scream of terror, he thought himself crushed as flat as  a Friesland cheese.    But he wasn't! Waking up and rubbing his eyes, he saw the red sun rising  on the sand-dunes. Birds were singing and the cocks were crowing all  around him, in chorus, as if saluting him. Just then also the village  clock chimed out the hour. He felt his clothes. They were wet with dew.  He sat up to look around. There were no fairies, but in his mouth was a  bunch of grass which he had been chewing lustily.    Klaas never would tell the story of his night with the fairies, nor has  he yet settled the question whether they left him because the  cheese-house of his dream had fallen, or because daylight had come.          THE PRINCESS WITH TWENTY PETTICOATS      Long, long ago, before ever a blue flax-flower bloomed in Holland, and  when Dutch mothers wore wolf-skin clothes, there was a little princess,  very much beloved by her father, who was a great king, or war chief. She  was very pretty and fond of seeing herself. There were no metal mirrors  in those days, nor any looking glass. So she went into the woods and  before the pools and the deep, quiet watercourses, made reflection of  her own lovely face. Of this pleasure she never seemed weary.    Yet sometimes this little princess was very naughty. Then her temper was  not nearly so sweet as her face. She would play in the sand and roll  around in the woods among the leaves and bushes until her curls were all  tangled up. When her nurse combed out her hair with a stone comb--for no  other kinds were then known--she would fret and scold and often stamp  her foot. When very angry, she called her nurse or governess an  \"aurochs,\"--a big beast like a buffalo. At this, the maid put up her  hands to her face. \"Me--an aurochs! Horrible!\" Then she would feel her  forehead to see if horns were growing there.    The nurse--they called her \"governess,\" as the years went on--grew tired  of the behavior of the bad young princess. Sometimes she went and told  her mother how naughty her daughter was, even to calling her an aurochs.  Then the little girl only showed her bad temper worse. She rolled among  the leaves all the more and mussed up her ringlets, so that the  governess could hardly comb them out smooth again.    It seemed useless to punish the perverse little maid by boxing her ears,  pinching her arm, or giving her a good spanking. They even tried to  improve her temper by taking away her dinner, but it did no good.    Then the governess and mother went together to her father. When they  complained of his daughter to the king, he was much worried. He could  fight strong men with his club and spear, and even giants with his sword  and battle-axe; but how to correct his little daughter, whom he loved as  his own eyes, was too much for him. He had no son and the princess was  his only child, and the hopes of the family all rested on her. The king  wondered how she would govern his people, after he should die, and she  became the queen. Yet he was glad for one thing: that, with all her  naughtiness, she was, like her father, always kind to animals. Her pet  was a little aurochs calf. Some hunters had killed the mother of the  poor little thing in winter time. So the princess kept the creature warm  and it fed out of her hand daily.    It was in gloom and with a sad face that the king walked in the woods,  thinking how to make a sweet-tempered lady out of his petulant daughter,  who was fast growing up to be a tall, fine-looking woman.    Now when the king had been himself a little boy, he was very kind to all  living creatures, wild and tame, dumb and with voice--yes, even to the  trees in the forest. When a prince, the boy would never let the axe men  cut down an oak until they first begged pardon of the fairy that lived  in the tree.    There was one big oak, especially, which was near the mansion of his  father, the king. It was said that the doctors found little babies in  its leafy branches, and brought them to their mothers. The prince-boy  took great care of this tree. He was taught by a wise man to cut off the  dead limbs, keep off the worms, and warn away all people seeking to  break off branches--even for Yule-tide, which came at our Christmas  time.    Once when some hunters had chased a young she-aurochs, with her two  calves, into the king's park, the prince, though he was then only a boy,  ran out and drove the rough fellows away. Then he sheltered and fed the  aurochs family of three, until they were fresh and fat. After this he  sent a skilled hunter to imitate the sound of an aurochs mother, to call  the aurochs father to the edge of the woods. He then let them all go  free, and was happy to see the dumb brutes frisking together.    Now that the boy-prince was grown to be a man and had long been king,  and had forgotten all about the incident of his earlier years, he was  one day walking in the forest.    Suddenly a gentle breeze arose and the leaves of the old oak tree began  first to rustle and then to whisper. Soon the words were clear, and the  spirit in the oak said:    \"I have seen a thousand years pass by, since I was an acorn planted  here. In a few moments I shall die and fall down. Cut my body into  staves. Of these make a wooden petticoat, like a barrel, for your  daughter. When her temper is bad, let her put it on and wear it until  she promises to be good.\"    The king was sad at the thought of losing the grand old tree, under  which he had played as a boy and his fathers before him. His countenance  fell.    \"Cheer up, my friend,\" said the oak, \"for something better shall follow.  When I pass away, you will find on this spot a blue flower growing.  Where the forest was shall be fields, on which the sun shines. Then, if  your daughter be good, young women shall spin something prettier than  wooden petticoats. Watch for the blue flower. Moreover,\" added the voice  of the tree, \"that I may not be forgotten, do you take, henceforth, as  your family name Ten Eyck\" (which, in Dutch, means \"at the oak \").    At this moment, a huge aurochs rushed into the wood. Its long hair and  shaggy mane were gray with age. The king, thinking the beast would lower  his horns and charge at him, drew his sword to fight the mighty brute  that seemed to weigh well-nigh a ton.    But the aurochs stopped within ten feet of the king and bellowed; but,  in a minute or two, the bellowing changed to a voice and the king heard  these good words:    \"I die with the oak, for we are brothers, kept under an enchantment for  a thousand years, which is to end in a few moments. Neither a tree nor  an aurochs can forget your kindness to us, when you were a prince. As  soon as our spirits are released, and we both go back to our home in the  moon, saw off my right horn and make of it a comb for use on your  daughter's curls. It will be smoother than stone.\"    In a moment a tempest arose, which drove the king for shelter behind  some rocks hard by. After a few minutes, the wind ceased and the sky was  clear. The king looked and there lay the oak, fallen at full length, and  the aurochs lay lifeless beside it.    Just then, the king's woodmen, who were out--thinking their master  might be hurt--drew near. He ordered them to take out the right horn of  the aurochs and to split up part of the oak for slaves. The next day,  they made a wooden petticoat and a horn comb. They were such"]]]
