Wisk had already rendered himself invisible and flown through the big  world to see how the children were getting along on this bright  Christmas morning; and by the time he returned, Peter had finished  telling Santa Claus of how they had distributed the toys.    \"We really did very well,\" cried the fairy, in a pleased voice; \"for I  found little unhappiness among the children this morning.  Still, you  must not get captured again, my dear master; for we might not be so  fortunate another time in carrying out your ideas.\"    He then related the mistakes that had been made, and which he had not  discovered until his tour of inspection.  And Santa Claus at once sent  him with rubber boots for Charlie Smith, and a doll for Mamie Brown;  so that even those two disappointed ones became happy.    As for the wicked Daemons of the Caves, they were filled with anger  and chagrin when they found that their clever capture of Santa Claus  had come to naught.  Indeed, no one on that Christmas Day appeared to  be at all selfish, or envious, or hateful.  And, realizing that while  the children's saint had so many powerful friends it was folly to  oppose him, the Daemons never again attempted to interfere with his  journeys on Christmas Eve."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/520"],[0,"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (#3)"],[1,"as a privileged  person, being especially protected by Queen Zurline and her nymphs and  favored by the great Ak himself.    One day the Master Woodsman came back to the forest of Burzee.  He had  visited, in turn, all his forests throughout the world, and they were  many and broad.    Not until he entered the glade where the Queen and her nymphs were  assembled to greet him did Ak remember the child he had permitted  Necile to adopt.  Then he found, sitting familiarly in the circle of  lovely immortals, a broad-shouldered, stalwart youth, who, when erect,  stood fully as high as the shoulder of the Master himself.    Ak paused, silent and frowning, to bend his piercing gaze upon Claus.  The clear eyes met his own steadfastly, and the Woodsman gave a sigh of  relief as he marked their placid depths and read the youth's brave and  innocent heart.  Nevertheless, as Ak sat beside the fair Queen, and the  golden chalice, filled with rare nectar, passed from lip to lip, the  Master Woodsman was strangely silent and reserved, and stroked his  beard many times with a thoughtful motion.    With morning he called Claus aside, in kindly fashion, saying:    \"Bid good by, for a time, to Necile and her sisters; for you shall  accompany me on my journey through the world.\"    The venture pleased Claus, who knew well the honor of being companion  of the Master Woodsman of the world.  But Necile wept for the first  time in her life, and clung to the boy's neck as if she could not bear  to let him go.  The nymph who had mothered this sturdy youth was still  as dainty, as charming and beautiful as when she had dared to face Ak  with the babe clasped to her breast; nor was her love less great.  Ak  beheld the two clinging together, seemingly as brother and sister to  one another, and again he wore his thoughtful look.        6.  Claus Discovers Humanity    Taking Claus to a small clearing in the forest, the Master said: \"Place  your hand upon my girdle and hold fast while we journey through the  air; for now shall we encircle the world and look upon many of the  haunts of those men from whom you are descended.\"    These words caused Claus to marvel, for until now he had thought  himself the only one of his kind upon the earth; yet in silence he  grasped firmly the girdle of the great Ak, his astonishment forbidding  speech.    Then the vast forest of Burzee seemed to fall away from their feet, and  the youth found himself passing swiftly through the air at a great  height.    Ere long there were spires beneath them, while buildings of many shapes  and colors met their downward view.  It was a city of men, and Ak,  pausing to descend, led Claus to its inclosure.  Said the Master:    \"So long as you hold fast to my girdle you will remain unseen by all  mankind, though seeing clearly yourself.  To release your grasp will be  to separate yourself forever from me and your home in Burzee.\"    One of the first laws of the Forest is obedience, and Claus had no  thought of disobeying the Master's wish.  He clung fast to the girdle  and remained invisible.    Thereafter with each moment passed in the city the youth's wonder grew.  He, who had supposed himself created differently from all others, now  found the earth swarming with creatures of his own kind.    \"Indeed,\" said Ak, \"the immortals are few; but the mortals are many.\"    Claus looked earnestly upon his fellows.  There were sad faces, gay and  reckless faces, pleasant faces, anxious faces and kindly faces, all  mingled in puzzling disorder.  Some worked at tedious tasks; some  strutted in impudent conceit; some were thoughtful and grave while  others seemed happy and content.  Men of many natures were there, as  everywhere, and Claus found much to please him and much to make him sad.    But especially he noted the children--first curiously, then eagerly,  then lovingly.  Ragged little ones rolled in the dust of the streets,  playing with scraps and pebbles.  Other children, gaily dressed, were  propped upon cushions and fed with sugar-plums.  Yet the children of  the rich were not happier than those playing with the dust and pebbles,  it seemed to Claus.    \"Childhood is the time of man's greatest content,\" said Ak, following  the youth's thoughts.  \"'Tis during these years of innocent pleasure  that the little ones are most free from care.\"    \"Tell me,\" said Claus, \"why do not all these babies fare alike?\"    \"Because they are born in both cottage and palace,\" returned the  Master.  \"The difference in the wealth of the parents determines the  lot of the child.  Some are carefully tended and clothed in silks and  dainty linen; others are neglected and covered with rags.\"    \"Yet all seem equally fair and sweet,\" said Claus, thoughtfully.    \"While they are babes--yes;\" agreed Ak.  \"Their joy is in being alive,  and they do not stop to think.  In after years the doom of mankind  overtakes them, and they find they must struggle and worry, work and  fret, to gain the wealth that is so dear to the hearts of men.  Such  things are unknown in the Forest where you were reared.\"  Claus was  silent a moment.  Then he asked:    \"Why was I reared in the forest, among those who are not of my race?\"    Then Ak, in gentle voice, told him the story of his babyhood: how he  had been abandoned at the forest's edge and left a prey to wild beasts,  and how the loving nymph Necile had rescued him and brought him to  manhood under the protection of the immortals.    \"Yet I am not of them,\" said Claus, musingly.    \"You are not of them,\" returned the Woodsman.  \"The nymph who cared for  you as a mother seems now like a sister to you; by and by, when you  grow old and gray, she will seem like a daughter.  Yet another brief  span and you will be but a memory, while she remains Necile.\"    \"Then why, if man must perish, is he born?\" demanded the boy.    \"Everything perishes except the world itself and its keepers,\" answered  Ak.  \"But while life lasts everything on earth has its use.  The wise  seek ways to be helpful to the world, for the helpful ones are sure to  live again.\"    Much of this Claus failed to understand fully, but a longing seized him  to become helpful to his fellows, and he remained grave and thoughtful  while they resumed their journey.    They visited many dwellings of men in many parts of the world, watching  farmers toil in the fields, warriors dash into cruel fray, and  merchants exchange their goods for bits of white and yellow metal.  And  everywhere the eyes of Claus sought out the children in love and pity,  for the thought of his own helpless babyhood was strong within him and  he yearned to give help to the innocent little ones of his race even as  he had been succored by the kindly nymph.    Day by day the Master Woodsman and his pupil traversed the earth, Ak  speaking but seldom to the youth who clung steadfastly to his girdle,  but guiding him into all places where he might become familiar with the  lives of human beings.    And at last they returned to the grand old Forest of Burzee, where the  Master set Claus down within the circle of nymphs, among whom the  pretty Necile anxiously awaited him.    The brow of the great Ak was now calm and peaceful; but the brow of  Claus had become lined with deep thought.  Necile sighed at the change  in her foster-son, who until now had been ever joyous and smiling, and  the thought came to her that never again would the life of the boy be  the same as before this eventful journey with the Master.        7.  Claus Leaves the Forest    When good Queen Zurline had touched the golden chalice with her fair  lips and it had passed around the circle in honor of the travelers'  return, the Master Woodsman of the World, who had not yet spoken,  turned his gaze frankly upon Claus and said:    \"Well?\"    The boy understood, and rose slowly to his feet beside Necile.  Once  only his eyes passed around the familiar circle of nymphs, every one of  whom he remembered as a loving comrade; but tears came unbidden to dim  his sight, so he gazed thereafter steadfastly at the Master.    \"I have been ignorant,\" said he, simply, \"until the great Ak in his  kindness taught me who and what I am.  You, who live so sweetly in your  forest bowers, ever fair and youthful and innocent, are no fit comrades  for a son of humanity.  For I have looked upon man, finding him doomed  to live for a brief space upon earth, to toil for the things he needs,  to fade into old age, and then to pass away as the leaves in autumn.  Yet every man has his mission, which is to leave the world better, in  some way, than he found it.  I am of the race of men, and man's lot is  my lot.  For your tender care of the poor, forsaken babe you adopted,  as well as for your loving comradeship during my boyhood, my heart will  ever overflow with gratitude.  My foster-mother,\" here he stopped and  kissed Necile's white forehead, \"I shall love and cherish while life  lasts.  But I must leave you, to take my part in the endless struggle  to which humanity is doomed, and to live my life in my own way.\"    \"What will you do?\" asked the Queen, gravely.    \"I must devote myself to the care of the children of mankind, and try  to make them happy,\" he answered.  \"Since your own tender care of a  babe brought to me happiness and strength, it is just and right that I  devote my life to the pleasure of other babes.  Thus will the memory of  the loving nymph Necile be planted within the hearts of thousands of my  race for many years to come, and her kindly act be recounted in song  and in story while the world shall last.  Have I spoken well, O Master?\"    \"You have spoken well,\" returned Ak, and rising to his feet he  continued: \"Yet one thing must not be forgotten.  Having been adopted  as the child of the Forest, and the playfellow of the nymphs, you have  gained a distinction which forever separates you from your kind.  Therefore, when you go forth into the world of men you shall retain the"]]]
