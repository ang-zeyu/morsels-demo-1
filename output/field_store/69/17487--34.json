Especially not what's happened today.\"  \"Why especially not what's  happened today?\"  \"I wouldn't want to say that I see all of this as a  joke, you seem to have gone to too much trouble making all these  arrangements for that.  Everyone in the house must be taking part in it  as well as all of you, that would be going beyond what could be a joke.  So I don't want to say that this is a joke.\"  \"Quite right,\" said the  supervisor, looking to see how many matches were left in the box.  \"But  on the other hand,\" K. went on, looking round at everyone there and even  wishing he could get the attention of the three who were looking at the  photographs,  \"on the other hand this really can't be all that  important.  That follows from the fact that I've been indicted, but  can't think of the slightest  offence for which I could be indicted.  But even that is all beside the point, the main question is: Who is  issuing the indictment?  What office is conducting this affair?  Are you  officials?  None of you is wearing a uniform, unless what you are  wearing\" - here he turned towards Franz - \"is meant to be a uniform,  it's actually more of a travelling suit.  I require a clear answer to  all these questions, and I'm quite sure that once things have been made  clear we can take our leave of each other on the best of terms.\"   The  supervisor slammed the box of matches down on the table.  \"You're making  a big mistake,\" he said. \"These gentlemen and I have got nothing to do  with your business, in fact we know almost nothing about you.  We could  be wearing uniforms as proper and exact as you like and your situation  wouldn't be any the worse for it.  As to whether you're on a charge, I  can't give you any sort of clear answer to that, I don't even know  whether you are or not.  You're under arrest, you're quite right about  that, but I don't know any more than that.  Maybe these officers have  been chit-chatting with you, well if they have that's all it is, chit-  chat.  I can't give you an answer to your questions, but I can give you  a bit of advice: You'd better think less about us and what's going to  happen to you, and think a bit more about yourself.  And stop making all  this fuss about your sense of innocence; you don't make such a bad  impression, but with all this fuss you're damaging it.  And you ought to  do a bit less talking, too.  Almost everything you've said so far has  been things we could have taken from your behaviour, even if you'd said  no more than a few words.  And what you have said has not exactly been  in your favour.\"            K. stared at the supervisor.  Was this man, probably younger than  he was, lecturing him like a schoolmaster?  Was he being punished for  his honesty with a telling off?  And was he to learn nothing about the  reasons for his arrest or those who were arresting him?  He became  somewhat cross and began to walk up and down.  No-one stopped him doing  this and he pushed his sleeves back, felt his chest, straightened his  hair,  went over to the three men, said, \"It makes no sense,\" at which  these three turned round to face him and came towards him with serious  expressions.  He finally came again to a halt in front of the  supervisor's desk.  \"State Attorney Hasterer is a good friend of mine,\"  he said, \"can I telephone him?\"  \"Certainly,\" said the supervisor, \"but  I don't know what the point of that will be, I suppose you must have  some private matter you want to discuss with him.\"  \"What the point is?\"  shouted K., more disconcerted that cross.   \"Who do you think you are?  You want to see some point in it while you're carrying out something as  pointless as it could be?  It's enough to make you cry!  These gentlemen  first accost me, and now they sit or stand about in here and let me be  hauled up in front of you.  What point there would be, in telephoning a  state attorney when I'm ostensibly under arrest?  Very well, I won't  make the telephone call.\"  \"You can call him if you want to,\" said the  supervisor, stretching his hand out towards the outer room where the  telephone was, \"please, go on, do make your phone call.\"  \"No, I don't  want to any more,\" said K., and went over to the window.  Across the  street, the people were still there at the window, and it was only now  that K. had gone up to his window that they seemed to become uneasy  about quietly watching what was going on.  The old couple wanted to get  up but the man behind them calmed them down.  \"We've got some kind of  audience over there,\" called K. to the supervisor, quite loudly, as he  pointed out with his forefinger.  \"Go away,\" he then called across to  them.  And the three of them did immediately retreat a few steps, the  old pair even found themselves behind the man who then concealed them  with the breadth of his body and seemed, going by the movements of his  mouth, to be saying something incomprehensible into the distance.  They  did not disappear entirely, though, but seemed to be waiting for the  moment when they could come back to the window without being noticed.  \"Intrusive, thoughtless people!\" said K. as he turned back into the  room.  The supervisor may have agreed with him, at least K. thought that  was what he saw from the corner of his eye.  But it was just as possible  that he had not even been listening as he had his hand pressed firmly  down on the table and seemed to be comparing the length of his fingers.  The two policemen were sitting on a chest covered with a coloured  blanket, rubbing their knees.  The three young people had put their  hands on their hips and were looking round aimlessly.  Everything was  still, like in some office that has been forgotten about.  \"Now,  gentlemen,\" called out K., and for a moment it seemed as if he was  carrying all of them on his shoulders, \"it looks like your business with  me is over with.  In my opinion, it's best now to stop wondering about  whether you're proceeding correctly or incorrectly, and to bring the  matter to a peaceful close with a mutual handshake.  If you are of the  same opinion, then please...\" and he walked up to the supervisor's desk  and held out his hand to him.  The supervisor raised his eyes, bit his  lip and looked at K.'s outstretched hand; K still believed the  supervisor would do as he suggested.  But instead, he stood up, picked  up a hard round hat that was laying on Miss Buerstner's bed and put it  carefully onto his head, using both hands as if trying on a new hat.  \"Everything seems so simple to you, doesn't it,\" he said to K. as he did  so, \"so you think we should bring the matter to a peaceful close, do  you.  No, no, that won't do.  Mind you, on the other hand I certainly  wouldn't want you to think there's no hope for you.  No, why should you  think that?  You're simply under arrest, nothing more than that.  That's  what I had to tell you, that's what I've done and now I've seen how  you've taken it.  That's enough for one day and we can take our leave of  each other, for the time being at least.  I expect you'll want to go in  to the bank now, won't you.\"  \"In to the bank?\" asked K., \"I thought I  was under arrest.\"   K. said this with a certain amount of defiance as,  although his handshake had not been accepted, he was feeling more  independent of all these people, especially since the supervisor had  stood up.  He was playing with them.  If they left, he had decided he  would run after them and offer to let them arrest him.  That's why he  even repeated, \"How can I go in to the bank when I'm under arrest?\"  \"I  see you've misunderstood me,\" said the supervisor who was already at the  door. \"It's true that you're under arrest, but that shouldn't stop you  from carrying out your job.  And there shouldn't be anything to stop you  carrying on with your usual life.\"  \"In that case it's not too bad,  being under arrest,\" said K., and went up close to the supervisor.  \"I  never meant it should be anything else,\" he replied.  \"It hardly seems  to have been necessary to notify me of the arrest in that case,\" said K.,  and went even closer.  The others had also come closer. All of them had  gathered together into a narrow space by the door.  \"That was my duty,\"  said the supervisor.  \"A silly duty,\" said K., unyielding.  \"Maybe so,\"  replied the supervisor, \"only don't let's waste our time talking on like  this.  I had assumed you'd be wanting to go to the bank.  As you're  paying close attention to every word I'll add this: I'm not forcing you  to go to the bank, I'd just assumed you wanted to.  And to make things  easier for you, and to let you get to the bank with as little fuss as  possible I've put these three gentlemen, colleagues of yours, at your  disposal.\"  \"What's that?\" exclaimed K., and looked at the three in  astonishment.  He could only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7853"],[0,"Quentin Durward (#3)"],[1,"the various woes  with which it was menaced, the tottering throne was ascended by Louis  XI, whose character, evil as it was in itself, met, combated, and in  a great degree neutralized the mischiefs of the time--as poisons of  opposing qualities are said, in ancient books of medicine, to have the  power of counteracting each other.    Brave enough for every useful and political purpose, Louis had not a  spark of that romantic valour, or of the pride generally associated with  it, which fought on for the point of honour, when the point of utility  had been long gained. Calm, crafty, and profoundly attentive to his  own interest, he made every sacrifice, both of pride and passion,  which could interfere with it. He was careful in disguising his real  sentiments and purposes from all who approached him, and frequently used  the expressions, \"that the king knew not how to reign, who knew not how  to dissemble; and that, for himself, if he thought his very cap knew his  secrets, he would throw it into the fire.\" No man of his own, or of any  other time, better understood how to avail himself of the frailties  of others, and when to avoid giving any advantage by the untimely  indulgence of his own.    He was by nature vindictive and cruel, even to the extent of finding  pleasure in the frequent executions which he commanded. But, as no touch  of mercy ever induced him to spare, when he could with safety condemn,  so no sentiment of vengeance ever stimulated him to a premature  violence. He seldom sprang on his prey till it was fairly within his  grasp, and till all hope of rescue was vain; and his movements were  so studiously disguised, that his success was generally what first  announced to the world the object he had been manoeuvring to attain.    In like manner, the avarice of Louis gave way to apparent profusion,  when it was necessary to bribe the favourite or minister of a rival  prince for averting any impending attack, or to break up any alliance  confederated against him. He was fond of license and pleasure; but  neither beauty nor the chase, though both were ruling passions, ever  withdrew him from the most regular attendance to public business and the  affairs of his kingdom. His knowledge of mankind was profound, and he  had sought it in the private walks of life, in which he often personally  mingled; and, though naturally proud and haughty, he hesitated not,  with an inattention to the arbitrary divisions of society which was then  thought something portentously unnatural, to raise from the lowest rank  men whom he employed on the most important duties, and knew so well how  to choose them, that he was rarely disappointed in their qualities.  Yet there were contradictions in the character of this artful and able  monarch; for human nature is rarely uniform. Himself the most false and  insincere of mankind, some of the greatest errors of his life arose from  too rash a confidence in the honour and integrity of others. When these  errors took place, they seem to have arisen from an over refined system  of policy, which induced Louis to assume the appearance of undoubting  confidence in those whom it was his object to overreach; for, in his  general conduct, he was as jealous and suspicious as any tyrant who ever  breathed.    Two other points may be noticed to complete the sketch of this  formidable character, by which he rose among the rude, chivalrous  sovereigns of the period to the rank of a keeper among wild beasts,  who, by superior wisdom and policy, by distribution of food, and some  discipline by blows, comes finally to predominate over those who, if  unsubjected by his arts, would by main strength have torn him to pieces.    The first of these attributes was Louis's excessive superstition, a  plague with which Heaven often afflicts those who refuse to listen to  the dictates of religion. The remorse arising from his evil  actions Louis never endeavoured to appease by any relaxation in his  Machiavellian stratagems [on account of the alleged political immorality  of Machiavelli, an illustrious Italian of the sixteenth century, this  expression has come to mean \"destitute of political morality; habitually  using duplicity and bad faith.\" Cent. Dict.], but laboured in vain to  soothe and silence that painful feeling by superstitious observances,  severe penance, and profuse gifts to the ecclesiastics. The second  property, with which the first is sometimes found strangely united, was  a disposition to low pleasures and obscure debauchery. The wisest, or  at least the most crafty sovereign of his time, he was fond of low life,  and, being himself a man of wit, enjoyed the jests and repartees of  social conversation more than could have been expected from other points  of his character. He even mingled in the comic adventures of obscure  intrigue, with a freedom little consistent with the habitual and guarded  jealousy of his character, and he was so fond of this species of humble  gallantry, that he caused a number of its gay and licentious anecdotes  to be enrolled in a collection well known to book collectors, in whose  eyes (and the work is unfit for any other) the right edition is very  precious.    [This editio princeps, which, when in good preservation, is much  sought after by connoisseurs, is entitled Les Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles,  contenant Cent Histoires Nouveaux, qui sont moult plaisans a raconter  en toutes bonnes compagnies par maniere de joyeuxete. Paris, Antoine  Verard. Sans date d'annee d'impression; en folio gotique. See De Bure.  S]    By means of this monarch's powerful and prudent, though most unamiable  character, it pleased Heaven, who works by the tempest as well as by the  soft, small rain, to restore to the great French nation the benefits of  civil government, which, at the time of his accession, they had nearly  lost.    Ere he succeeded to the crown, Louis had given evidence of his vices  rather than of his talents. His first wife, Margaret of Scotland, was  \"done to death by slanderous tongues\" in her husband's court, where,  but for the encouragement of Louis himself, not a word would have been  breathed against that amiable and injured princess. He had been an  ungrateful and a rebellious son, at one time conspiring to seize his  father's person, and at another levying open war against him. For the  first offence, he was banished to his appanage of Dauphine, which he  governed with much sagacity; for the second he was driven into absolute  exile, and forced to throw himself on the mercy, and almost on  the charity, of the Duke of Burgundy and his son; where he enjoyed  hospitality, afterwards indifferently requited, until the death of his  father in 1461.    In the very outset of his reign, Louis was almost overpowered by a  league formed against him by the great vassals of France, with the Duke  of Burgundy, or rather his son, the Count de Charalois, at its head.  They levied a powerful army, blockaded Paris, fought a battle of  doubtful issue under its very walls, and placed the French monarchy on  the brink of actual destruction. It usually happens in such cases,  that the more sagacious general of the two gains the real fruit, though  perhaps not the martial fame, of the disputed field. Louis, who had  shown great personal bravery during the battle of Montl'hery, was able,  by his prudence, to avail himself of its undecided character, as if it  had been a victory on his side. He temporized until the enemy had broken  up their leaguer, and showed so much dexterity in sowing jealousies  among those great powers, that their alliance \"for the public weal,\" as  they termed it, but in reality for the overthrow of all but the external  appearance of the French monarchy, dissolved itself, and was never again  renewed in a manner so formidable. From this period, Louis, relieved  of all danger from England by the Civil Wars of York and Lancaster,  was engaged for several years, like an unfeeling but able physician,  in curing the wounds of the body politic, or rather in stopping, now by  gentle remedies, now by the use of fire and steel, the progress of those  mortal gangrenes with which it was then infected. The brigandage of the  Free Companies [troops that acknowledged no authority except that of  their leaders, and who hired themselves out at will], and the unpunished  oppression of the nobility, he laboured to lessen, since he could not  actually stop them; and, by dint of unrelaxed attention, he gradually  gained some addition to his own regal authority, or effected some  diminution of those by whom it was counterbalanced.    Still the King of France was surrounded by doubt and danger. The members  of the league \"for the public weal,\" though not in unison, were in  existence, and, like a scotched snake [see Macbeth. III, ii, 13, \"We  have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it.\"], might reunite and become  dangerous again. But a worse danger was the increasing power of the  Duke of Burgundy, then one of the greatest princes of Europe, and little  diminished in rank by the very slight dependence of his duchy upon the  crown of France.    Charles, surnamed the Bold, or rather, the Audacious, for his courage  was allied to rashness and frenzy, then wore the ducal coronet of  Burgundy, which he burned to convert into a royal and independent  regal crown. The character of this Duke was in every respect the direct  contrast to that of Louis XI.    The latter was calm, deliberate, and crafty, never prosecuting a  desperate enterprise, and never abandoning one likely to be successful,  however distant the prospect. The genius of the Duke was entirely  different. He rushed on danger because he loved it, and on difficulties  because he despised them. As Louis never sacrificed his interest to his  passion, so Charles, on the other hand, never sacrificed his passion,  or even his humour, to any other consideration.
