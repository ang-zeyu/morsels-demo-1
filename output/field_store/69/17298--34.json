Instead of vainly struggling, therefore, they do what they can to  safeguard the future; and, obeying a foresight that for once is in  error, they fly to their reserves of honey, into which they eagerly  dip in order to possess within themselves the wherewithal to start a  new city, immediately and no matter where, should the ancient one be  destroyed or they be compelled to forsake it.    {7}    The first impression of the novice before whom an observation-hive*  is opened will be one of some disappointment. He had been told that  this little glass case contained an unparalleled activity, an  infinite number of wise laws, and a startling amalgam of mystery,  experience, genius, calculation, science, of various industries, of  certitude and prescience, of intelligent habits and curious feelings  and virtues. All that he sees is a confused mass of little reddish  groups, somewhat resembling roasted coffee-berries, or bunches of  raisins piled against the glass. They look more dead than alive;  their movements are slow, incoherent, and incomprehensible. Can  these be the wonderful drops of light he had seen but a moment ago,  unceasingly flashing and sparkling, as they darted among the pearls  and the gold of a thousand wide-open calyces?    By observation-hive is meant a hive of glass, furnished with black  curtains or shutters. The best kind have only one comb, thus  permitting both faces to be studied. These hives can be placed in a  drawing-room, library, etc., without inconvenience or danger. The  bees that inhabit the one I have in my study in Paris are able even  in the stony desert of that great city, to find the wherewithal to  nourish themselves and to prosper.    They appear to be shivering in the darkness, to be numbed,  suffocated, so closely are they huddled together; one might fancy  they were ailing captives, or queens dethroned, who have had their  one moment of glory in the midst of their radiant garden, and are  now compelled to return to the shameful squalor of their poor  overcrowded home.    It is with them as with all that is deeply real; they must be  studied, and one must learn how to study them. The inhabitant of  another planet who should see men and women coming and going almost  imperceptibly through our streets, crowding at certain times around  certain buildings, or waiting for one knows not what, without  apparent movement, in the depths of their dwellings, might conclude  therefrom that they, too, were miserable and inert. It takes time to  distinguish the manifold activity contained in this inertia.    And indeed every one of the little almost motionless groups in the  hive is incessantly working, each at a different trade. Repose is  unknown to any; and such, for instance, as seem the most torpid, as  they hang in dead clusters against the glass, are intrusted with the  most mysterious and fatiguing task of all: it is they who secrete  and form the wax. But the details of this universal activity will be  given in their place. For the moment we need only call attention to  the essential trait in the nature of the bee which accounts for the  extraordinary agglomeration of the various workers. The bee is above  all, and even to a greater extent than the ant, a creature of the  crowd. She can live only in the midst of a multitude. When she  leaves the hive, which is so densely packed that she has to force  her way with blows of her head through the living walls that enclose  her, she departs from her proper element. She will dive for an  instant into flower-filled space, as the swimmer will dive into the  sea that is filled with pearls, but under pain of death it behoves  her at regular intervals to return and breathe the crowd as the  swimmer must return and breathe the air. Isolate her, and however  abundant the food or favourable the temperature, she will expire in  a few days not of hunger or cold, but of loneliness. From the crowd,  from the city, she derives an invisible aliment that is as necessary  to her as honey. This craving will help to explain the spirit of the  laws of the hive. For in them the individual is nothing, her  existence conditional only, and herself, for one indifferent moment,  a winged organ of the race. Her whole life is an entire sacrifice to  the manifold, everlasting being whereof she forms part. It is  strange to note that it was not always so. We find even to-day,  among the melliferous hymenoptera, all the stages of progressive  civilisation of our own domestic bee. At the bottom of the scale we  find her working alone, in wretchedness, often not seeing her  offspring (the Prosopis, the Colletes, etc.); sometimes living in  the midst of the limited family that she produces annually (as in  the case of the humble-bee). Then she forms temporary associations (the  Panurgi, the Dasypodoe, the Hacliti, etc.) and at last we arrive,  through successive stages, at the almost perfect but pitiless society of  our hives, where the individual is entirely merged in the republic, and  the republic in its turn invariably sacrificed to the abstract and  immortal city of the future.    {8}    Let us not too hastily deduce from these facts conclusions that  apply to man. He possesses the power of withstanding certain of  nature's laws; and to know whether such resistance be right or wrong  is the gravest and obscurest point in his morality. But it is deeply  interesting to discover what the will of nature may be in a  different world; and this will is revealed with extraordinary  clearness in the evolution of the hymenoptera, which, of all the  inhabitants of this globe, possess the highest degree of intellect  after that of man. The aim of nature is manifestly the improvement  of the race; but no less manifest is her inability, or refusal, to  obtain such improvement except at the cost of the liberty, the  rights, and the happiness of the individual. In proportion as a  society organises itself, and rises in the scale, so does a  shrinkage enter the private life of each one of its members. Where  there is progress, it is the result only of a more and more complete  sacrifice of the individual to the general interest. Each one is  compelled, first of all, to renounce his vices, which are acts of  independence. For instance, at the last stage but one of apiarian  civilisation, we find the humble-bees, which are like our cannibals.  The adult workers are incessantly hovering around the eggs, which  they seek to devour, and the mother has to display the utmost  stubbornness in their defence. Then having freed himself from his  most dangerous vices, each individual has to acquire a certain  number of more and more painful virtues. Among the humble-bees, for  instance, the workers do not dream of renouncing love, whereas our  domestic bee lives in a state of perpetual chastity. And indeed we  soon shall show how much more she has to abandon, in exchange for  the comfort and security of the hive, for its architectural,  economic, and political perfection; and we shall return to the  evolution of the hymenoptera in the chapter devoted to the progress  of the species.          II -- THE SWARM    {9}    WE will now, so as to draw more closely to nature, consider the  different episodes of the swarm as they come to pass in an ordinary  hive, which is ten or twenty times more populous than an observation  one, and leaves the bees entirely free and untrammelled.    Here, then, they have shaken off the torpor of winter. The queen  started laying again in the very first days of February, and the  workers have flocked to the willows and nut-trees, gorse and  violets, anemones and lungworts. Then spring invades the earth, and  cellar and stream with honey and pollen, while each day beholds the  birth of thousands of bees. The overgrown males now all sally forth  from their cells, and disport themselves on the combs; and so  crowded does the too prosperous city become that hundreds of belated  workers, coming back from the flowers towards evening, will vainly  seek shelter within, and will be forced to spend the night on the  threshold, where they will be decimated by the cold. Restlessness  seizes the people, and the old queen begins to stir. She feels that  a new destiny is being prepared. She has religiously fulfilled her  duty as a good creatress; and from this duty done there result only  tribulation and sorrow. An invincible power menaces her  tranquillity; she will soon be forced to quit this city of hers,  where she has reigned. But this city is her work, it is she,  herself. She is not its queen in the sense in which men use the  word. She issues no orders; she obeys, as meekly as the humblest of  her subjects, the masked power, sovereignly wise, that for the  present, and till we attempt to locate it, we will term the \"spirit  of the hive.\" But she is the unique organ of love; she is the mother  of the city. She founded it amid uncertainty and poverty. She has  peopled it with her own substance; and all who move within its  walls--workers, males, larvae, nymphs, and the young princesses  whose approaching birth will hasten her own departure, one of them  being already designed as her successor by the \"spirit of the  hive\"--all these have issued from her flanks.    {10}    What is this \"spirit of the hive\"--where does it reside? It is not  like the special instinct that teaches the bird to construct its  well planned nest, and then seek other skies when the day for  migration returns. Nor is it a kind of mechanical habit of the race,  or blind craving for life, that will fling the bees upon any wild  hazard the moment an unforeseen event shall derange the accustomed  order of phenomena. On the contrary, be the event never so  masterful, the \"spirit of the hive\" still will follow it, step by  step, like an alert and quickwitted slave, who is able to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45149"],[0,"The House of the Lord: A Study of Holy Sanctuaries Ancient and Modern (#3)"],[1,"of Judea,  commenced the reconstruction of the then decayed and generally ruinous  Temple of Zerubbabel. For five centuries that structure had stood,  and doubtless it had become largely a wreck of time. Many incidents  in the earthly life of the Savior are associated with the Temple of  Herod. It is evident from scripture that while opposed to the degraded  and commercial uses to which the Temple had been betrayed, Christ  recognized and acknowledged the sanctity of the temple precincts. The  Temple of Herod was a sacred structure; by whatsoever name it might  have been known, it was to Him the House of the Lord. And then, when  the sable curtain descended upon the great tragedy of Calvary, when  at last the agonizing cry, \"It is finished,\" ascended from the cross,  the veil of the Temple was rent, and the one-time Holy of Holies was  bared. The absolute {11} destruction of the Temple had been foretold by  our Lord, while yet He lived in the flesh.[22] In the year 70 A.D. the  Temple was utterly destroyed by fire in connection with the capture of  Jerusalem by the Romans under Titus.    The Temple of Herod was the last temple reared on the eastern  hemisphere. From the destruction of that great edifice onward to the  time of the re-establishment of the Church of Jesus Christ in the  nineteenth century, our only record of temple building is such mention  as is found in Nephite chronicles. Book of Mormon scriptures affirm  that temples were erected by the Nephite colonists on what is now known  as the American continent; but we have few details of construction  and fewer facts as to administrative ordinances pertaining to these  western temples. The people constructed a Temple about 570 B. C. and  this we learn was patterned after the Temple of Solomon, though greatly  inferior to that gorgeous structure in grandeur and costliness.[23]  It is of interest to read that when the resurrected Lord manifested  Himself to the Nephites on the western continent, He found them  assembled about the Temple.[24] The Book of Mormon, however, makes no  mention of temples even as late as the time of the destruction of the  Temple at Jerusalem; and moreover the Nephite nation came to an end  within about four centuries after Christ. It is evident, therefore,  that on both hemispheres temples ceased to exist in the early period  of the apostasy and the very conception of a Temple in the distinctive  sense perished amongst mankind.    {12} For many centuries no offer of a sanctuary was made unto the Lord;  indeed, it appears that no need of such was recognized. The apostate  church declared that direct communication from God had ceased; and in  place of Divine administration a self-constituted government claimed  supreme power. It is evident that, as far as the Church was concerned,  the voice of the Lord had been silenced; that the people were no longer  willing to listen to the word of revelation, and that the government of  the Church had been abrogated by human agencies.[25]    When, in the reign of Constantine, a perverted Christianity had become  the religion of state, the need of a place wherein God would reveal  Himself was still utterly unseen or ignored. True, many edifices, most  of them costly and grand, were erected. Of these some were dedicated  to Peter and Paul, to James and John; others to the Magdalene and the  Virgin; but not one was raised by authority and name to the honor of  Jesus, the Christ. Among the multitude of chapels and shrines, of  churches and cathedrals, the Son of Man had not a place to call His  own. It was declared that the pope, sitting in Rome, was the vicegerent  of Christ, and that without revelation he was empowered to declare the  will of God.[26]    Not until the Gospel was restored in the nineteenth century, with its  ancient powers and privileges, was the Holy Priesthood manifest again  among men. And be it remembered that the authority to speak and act in  the name of God is essential to a Temple, and a Temple is void without  the sacred authority of the Holy Priesthood. In the year of our Lord  1820, Joseph Smith, the prophet {13} of the latest dispensation, then  a lad in his fifteenth year, received a Divine manifestation,[27] in  which both the Eternal Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared and  instructed the youthful suppliant. Through Joseph Smith, the Gospel  of old was restored to earth, and the ancient law was re-established.  In course of time, through the ministry of the prophet, The Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized, and its establishment  was marked by manifestations of Divine power.[28]    It is a significant fact that this Church, true to the distinction  it affirms--that of being the Church of the living God as its name  proclaims--began in the very early days of its history to provide for  the erection of a temple.[29] The Church was organized as an earthly  body-corporate on the sixth of April, A. D. 1830; and, in July of the  year following, a revelation was received designating the site of a  future temple near Independence, Missouri. The construction of a temple  on this chosen spot is yet delayed, as is also the case with another  temple-site in Far West Missouri,[30] on which the corner-stones were  laid in 1838. The Church holds as a sacred trust the commission to  build the temples so located, but as yet the way has not been opened  for the consummation of the plan. In the meantime temples in other  places have been reared, and already the modern dispensation is marked  by the erection of six such sacred edifices.    On the first day of June, 1833, in a revelation to the {14} Prophet  Joseph Smith, the Lord directed the immediate building of a holy  house, in which He promised to endow His chosen servants with power  and authority.[31] The people responded to the call with willingness  and devotion. In spite of dire poverty and in the face of unrelenting  persecution, the work was carried to completion, and in March, 1836,  the first Temple of modern times was dedicated at Kirtland, Ohio.[32]  The dedicatory services were marked by Divine manifestations comparable  to those attending the offering of the first Temple of olden times; and  on later occasions heavenly beings appeared within the sacred precincts  with revelations of the Divine will to man. In that place the Lord  Jesus was again seen and heard.[33] Within two years from the time of  its dedication the Kirtland Temple was abandoned by the people who  built it; they were forced to flee because of persecution, and with  their departure the sacred Temple became an ordinary house, disowned of  the Lord to whose name it had been reared. The building still stands  and is used as a meeting-house by a small and comparatively unknown  sect.    The migration of the Latter-day Saints was to the west; and they  established themselves first in Missouri, and later in Illinois with  Nauvoo as the central seat of the Church. Scarcely had they become  settled in their new abode when the voice of revelation was heard  calling upon the people to again build a house sacred to the name of  God.    The corner-stones of the Nauvoo Temple were laid April 6, 1841, and  the capstone was placed in position {15} May 24, 1845; each event was  celebrated by a solemn assembly and sacred service. Though it was  evident that the people would be forced to flee again, and though they  knew that the Temple would have to be abandoned soon after completion,  they labored with might and diligence to finish and properly furnish  the structure. It was dedicated April 30, 1846, though certain  portions, such as the baptistry, had been previously dedicated and used  in ordinance work. Many of the Saints received their blessings and holy  endowments in the Nauvoo Temple, though, even before the completion  of the building, the exodus of the people had begun. The Temple was  abandoned by those who in poverty and by sacrifice had reared it. In  November, 1848, it became a prey to incendiary flames, and in May,  1850, a tornado demolished what remained of the blackened walls.    On the 24th of July, 1847, the \"Mormon\" pioneers entered the valleys  of Utah, while yet the region was Mexican territory, and established  a settlement where now stands Salt Lake City. Four days later Brigham  Young, prophet and leader, indicated a site in the sage-brush wastes,  and, striking the arid ground with his staff, proclaimed, \"Here will  be the Temple of our God.\" That site is now the beautiful Temple  Block, around which the city has grown. In February, 1853, the area  was dedicated with sacred service, and on the 6th of April following,  the corner stones of the building were laid to the accompaniment of  solemn and imposing ceremony. The Salt Lake City Temple was forty years  in building; the capstone was laid on the 6th of April, 1892, and the  completed Temple was dedicated one year later.    Of the four Temples already erected in Utah, the one {16} in Salt Lake  City was the first begun and the last finished. During its course  of construction three other Temples were built by the Latter-day  Saints, one at St. George, one at Logan, and one at Manti, Utah. Add  to these the two earlier Temples--at Kirtland, Ohio, and at Nauvoo,  Illinois--and we have six of these sacred structures already erected in  the present and last dispensation of the Priesthood--the dispensation  of the fulness of times.    It is not the purpose of the present chapter to consider in detail any  particular Temple, either ancient or modern; but rather to show the  essential and distinguishing features of Temples, and to make plain  the fact that in both ancient and modern times the covenant people  have regarded the building of Temples as a labor specifically required  at their hands. From what has been said it is plain that a Temple is  more than chapel or church, more than synagogue or cathedral; it is  a structure erected as the House of the "]]]
