The painting however  dates from the days when Cortona was still Etruscan. Perugia keeps  her ancient inhabitants themselves, in the shape at least of their  skulls and skeletons. At Cortona the remote mothers, it may be, of her  present people live more vividly in the form of the Muse whose features  were copied, it may be nineteen hundred years back, from the living  countenance of one of them.          Perugia.      The hill-city of Perugia supplies an instructive contrast with the  hill-city of Cortona. The obvious contrast in the matter of modern  prosperity and importance is an essential part of the comparative  history. Cortona has through all ages lived on, but not much more  than lived on. Perugia has, through all ages, kept, if not a place  in the first rank of Italian cities, yet at any rate a high place in  the second rank. She never had the European importance of Venice,  Genoa, Florence, Naples, and Milan, or of Pisa in her great days.  But in the purely Italian history of all ages Perugia keeps herself  before our eyes, as a city of mark, from the wars of the growing Roman  commonwealth down to the struggle which in our own days freed her from  a second Roman yoke. In the civil wars of the old Rome, in the wars  between the Goth and the New Rome, in the long tale of the troubled  greatness of mediaeval Italy, Etruscan Perusia, Roman Augusta Perusia,  mediaeval and modern Perugia, holds no mean place. And the last act  in the long drama is not the least notable. It sounds like a bit out  of Plutarch's \"Life of Timoleon,\" when we read or when we remember  how, twice within our own days, little more than twenty and thirty  years back, the fortress of the tyrants was swept away, as the great  symbolic act which crowned the winning back of freedom in its newest  form. When a city has such a tale as this to tell, we do not expect, we  do not wish, that its only or its chief interest should gather round  the monuments of an early and almost praehistoric day of greatness. At  Cortona we are glad that things Etruscan are undoubtedly uppermost.  At Perugia we are glad that things Etruscan are there to be seen in  abundance; but we also welcome the monuments of Roman days, pagan  and Christian; we welcome the streets, the churches, and palaces of  mediaeval times, and even the works of recent times indeed. The Place of  Victor Emmanuel with the modern buildings which crown it, supplanting  the fortress of Pope Paul, as that supplanted the houses, churches, and  palaces of earlier times, is as much a part of the history of Perugia  as the Arch of Augustus or the Etruscan wall itself.    The difference between the abiding greatness of Perugia and the  abiding littleness of Cortona is no doubt largely due to the physical  difference of their sites. Both are hill-cities, mountain-cities, if  we will; but they sit upon hills of quite different kinds. The hill of  Perugia is better fitted for growth than the hill of Cortona. Cortona  sits on a single hill-top. Perugia sits, not indeed on seven hills, but  on a hill of complicated outline, which throws out several--possibly  seven--outlying, mostly lower, spurs, with deep valleys between them.  The Etruscan and Roman city took in only the central height, itself of  a very irregular shape and at some points very narrow. The lower and  outlying spurs were taken within the city in later times. Hence it is  only in a small part of their circuit that the original walls remain  the present external walls; it is only on part of its western side that  we can at all go behind Perugia. But the lower city is still thoroughly  a hill-city. The hill of Perugia is lower than the hill of Cortona,  while the city of Perugia is vastly greater than the city of Cortona.  But Perugia is as far removed as Cortona from coming down into the  plain. On the little hill of Arezzo such a process could happen, and it  has happened. Not so with the loftier seats of its neighbours. Cortona  is not likely to grow; Perugia very likely may. But it will take a long  period of downward growth before unbroken dwellings of men stretch all  the way from its railway station to its municipal palace.    At Perugia, as becomes its history, no one class of monuments draws  to itself exclusive, or even predominant, attention. Perhaps, on the  whole, the municipal element is the most striking. The vast pile of the  public palace, its grand portal, its bold ranges of windows, its worthy  satellites, the Exchange, and the great fountain with its marvels of  sculpture, utterly outdo, as the central points of the city, the lofty  but shapeless and unfinished cathedral which stands opposite to them.  And at this point, the Church and the commonwealth are the only rivals;  the remains of earlier times do not come into view. For them we must  seek, but at no great distance. Go down from the central height, and  stand on the bridge which spans the _Via Appia_ of Perugia, a strange  namesake for the _Via Appia_ of Rome. There the walls of the Etruscan  city, rising on the one side above the houses, on the other above one  of the deep valleys, form the main feature. And, if they lose in effect  from the modern houses built upon them, the very incongruity has a  kind of attractiveness, as binding the two ends of the story together.  From this point of view, Perugia is specially Perugian. And, if the  walls are less perfect than those of Cortona, they have something  that Cortona has not. The Arch of Augustus, the barrier between the  older and the newer city, spans the steep and narrow street fittingly  known as _Via Vecchia_. At Perugia the name of Augustus suggests the  thought whether he really made the bloody sacrifice to the _manes_ of  his uncle with which some reports charge him. The gate at least makes  no answer, save that we see that the Roman built on the foundations  of the Etruscan, save that the legend of \"Augusta Perusia\" is itself a  record of destruction and revival. The gateway, tall, narrow, gloomy,  the Roman arch springing from two vast Etruscan towers, is a contrast  indeed to such strictly architectural designs as the two gates of  Autun. The Roman builder was evidently cramped by the presence of the  older work. In fact the general character of the gateway has more in  common with the endless mediaeval gateways and arches which span the  streets of Perugia. Of really better design, though blocked and in a  less favourable position, is the other gateway, the _Porta Martis_,  which now makes part of the substructure of the new piazza, as it once  did of that of the papal fortress. And he who looks curiously will find  out, not indeed any more Roman gateways, but the jambs from which at  least two other arches, either Roman or Etruscan, once sprang.    The walls and gateways of a city can hardly be called its skeleton,  but they are in some sort its shell. And at Perugia the body within  the shell was of no mean kind. Take away every great public building,  church, or palace, and Perugia itself, its mere streets and houses,  would have a great deal to show. With no grand street arcades like  Bologna, few or no striking private palaces like Venice and Verona,  Perugia once had streets after streets--the small and narrow streets  not the least conspicuously--of a thoroughly good and simple style of  street architecture. Arched doors and arched windows are all, and they  are quite enough. Some are round, some are pointed; some are of brick,  some of stone; and those of brick with round arches are decidedly  the best. But never were buildings more mercilessly spoiled than the  Perugian houses. As in England mediaeval houses are spoiled to make  bigger windows, so at Perugia they are spoiled to make smaller windows.  Most of the doorways and windows are cut through and blocked, and an  ugly square hole is bored to do the duty of the artistic feature which  is destroyed. No land has more to show in the way of various forms of  beauty than Italy; but when an Italian does go in for ugliness he beats  all other nations in carrying out his object.    Perugia, we need hardly say, is a city of paintings, and it is as  receptacles for paintings that its churches seem mainly to be looked  on. But some of them deserve no small attention on other grounds. At  the two ends of the city are two churches which follow naturally on  the Etruscan and Roman walls and gates. At one end, the Church of St.  Angelo, circular within, sixteen-sided without, forms one of the long  series of round and polygonal churches which stretch from Jerusalem to  Ludlow. And this, clearly a building of Christian Roman times, with  its beautiful marble and granite Corinthian columns, though not one  of the greatest in size, holds no mean place among them. At the other  end, the Abbey of Saint Peter, amid many changes, still keeps two noble  ranges of Ionic columns, the spoils doubtless of some Pagan building  at its first erection in the eleventh century. Nor must the _duomo_  itself be judged of by its outside. The work of a German architect, it  shows a German character in the three bodies of the same height, and  its pillars consequently of amazing height. But at Perugia it is not  churches or palaces or earlier remains which we study, each apart from  other things. Here they all unite to form a whole greater than any one  class alone--Augusta Perusia itself.          The Volumnian Tomb.      The ancient Etruscans have some points of analogy with the modern  Freemasons. This last familiar and yet mysterious body seems to let the  outer world know everything about itself, except what it is. We have  read various books by Freemasons about Freemasonry, about its history,  its constitution, its ritual. On all these points they seem to give us  the fullest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4602"],[0,"\"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" (#3)"],[1," to test     our sincerity even as in a fiery ordeal.  It may subject us to     insult, outrage, suffering, yea, even death itself.  We     anticipate no small amount of misconception, misrepresentation,     and calumny.  Tumults may arise against us.  The proud and     pharisaical, the ambitious and tyrannical, principalities and     powers, may combine to crush us.  So they treated the Messiah     whose example we are humbly striving to imitate.  We shall not     be afraid of their terror.  Our confidence is in the Lord     Almighty and not in man.  Having withdrawn from human     protection, what can sustain us but that faith which overcomes     the world?  We shall not think it strange concerning the fiery     trial which is to try us, but rejoice inasmuch as we are     partakers of Christ's sufferings.       \"Wherefore we commit the keeping of our souls to God. For every     one that forsakes houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father,     or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for Christ's sake,     shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting     life.       \"Firmly relying upon the certain and universal triumph of the     sentiments contained in this declaration, however formidable     may be the opposition arrayed against them, we hereby affix our     signatures to it; commending it to the reason and conscience of     mankind, and resolving, in the strength of the Lord God, to     calmly and meekly abide the issue.\"    Immediately after this declaration a Society for Non-resistance was  founded by Garrison, and a journal called the NON-RESISTANT, in  which the doctrine of non-resistance was advocated in its full  significance and in all its consequences, as it had been expounded  in the declaration.  Further information as to the ultimate  destiny of the society and the journal I gained from the excellent  biography of W. L. Garrison, the work of his son.    The society and the journal did not exist for long.  The  greater number of Garrison's fellow-workers in the movement for  the liberation of the slaves, fearing that the too radical  programme of the journal, the NON-RESISTANT, might keep people  away from the practical work of negro-emancipation, gave up the  profession of the principle of non-resistance as it had been  expressed in the declaration, and both society and journal ceased  to exist.    This declaration of Garrison's gave so powerful and eloquent an  expression of a confession of faith of such importance to men,  that one would have thought it must have produced a strong  impression on people, and have become known throughout the world  and the subject of discussion on every side.  But nothing of the  kind occurred.  Not only was it unknown in Europe, even the  Americans, who have such a high opinion of Garrison, hardly knew  of the declaration.    Another champion of non-resistance has been overlooked in the same  way--the American Adin Ballou, who lately died, after spending fifty  years in preaching this doctrine. Lord God, to calmly and meekly abide  the doctrine. How great the ignorance is of everything relating to the  question of non-resistance may be seen from the fact that Garrison the  son, who has written an excellent biography of his father in four great  volumes, in answer to my inquiry whether there are existing now  societies for non-resistance, and adherents of the doctrine, told me  that as far as he knew that society had broken up, and that there were  no adherents of that doctrine, while at the very time when he was  writing to me there was living, at Hopedale in Massachusetts, Adin  Ballou, who had taken part in the labors of Garrison the father, and had  devoted fifty years of his life to advocating, both orally and in print,  the doctrine of non-resistance. Later on I received a letter from Wilson,  a pupil and colleague of Ballou's, and entered into correspondence with  Ballou himself. I wrote to Ballou, and he answered me and sent me his  works. Here is the summary of some extracts from them:       \"Jesus Christ is my Lord and teacher,\" says Ballou in one of     his essays exposing the inconsistency of Christians who allowed     a right of self-defense and of warfare.  \"I have promised     leaving all else, to follow good and through evil, to death     itself.  But I am a citizen of the democratic republic of the     United States; and in allegiance to it I have sworn to defend     the Constitution of my country, if need be, with my life.     Christ requires of me to do unto others as I would they should     do unto me.  The Constitution of the United States requires of     me to do unto two millions of slaves [at that time there were     slaves; now one might venture to substitute the word     'laborers'] the very opposite of what I would they should do     unto me--that is to help to keep them in their present     condition of slavery.  And, in spite of this, I continue to     elect or be elected, I propose to vote, I am even ready to be     appointed to any office under government.  That will not hinder     me from being a Christian.  I shall still profess Christianity,     and shall find no difficulty in carrying out my covenant     with Christ and with the government.       \"Jesus Christ forbids me to resist evil doers, and to take from     them an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, bloodshed for     bloodshed, and life for life.       \"My government demands from me quite the opposite, and bases a     system of self-defense on gallows, musket, and sword, to be     used against its foreign and domestic foes.  And the land is     filled accordingly with gibbets, prisons, arsenals, ships of     war, and soldiers.       \"In the maintenance and use of these expensive appliances for     murder, we can very suitably exercise to the full the virtues     of forgiveness to those who injure us, love toward our enemies,     blessings to those who curse us, and doing good to those who     hate us.       \"For this we have a succession of Christian priests to pray for     us and beseech the blessing of Heaven on the holy work of     slaughter.       \"I see all this (i. e., the contradiction between profession and     practice), and I continue to profess religion and take part in     government, and pride myself on being at the same time a devout     Christian and a devoted servant of the government.  I do not     want to agree with these senseless notions of non-resistance.     I cannot renounce my authority and leave only immoral men in     control of the government.  The Constitution says the     government has the right to declare war, and I assent to this     and support it, and swear that I will support it.  And I do not     for that cease to be a Christian. War, too, is a Christian     duty.  Is it not a Christian duty to kill hundreds of thousands     of one's fellow-men, to outrage women, to raze and burn towns,     and to practice every possible cruelty?  It is time to dismiss     all these false sentimentalities.  It is the truest means of     forgiving injuries and loving enemies.  If we only do it in the     spirit of love, nothing can be more Christian than such     murder.\"    In another pamphlet, entitled \"How many Men are Necessary to  Change a Crime into a Virtue?\" he says: \"One man may not kill.  If  he kills a fellow-creature, he is a murderer.  If two, ten, a  hundred men do so, they, too, are murderers.  But a government or  a nation may kill as many men as it chooses, and that will not be  murder, but a great and noble action.  Only gather the people  together on a large scale, and a battle of ten thousand men  becomes an innocent action.  But precisely how many people must  there be to make it so?--that is the question.  One man cannot  plunder and pillage, but a whole nation can.  But precisely how  many are needed to make it permissible?  Why is it that one man,  ten, a hundred, may not break the law of God, but a great number  may?\"    And here is a version of Ballou's catechism composed for his  flock:       CATECHISM OF NON-RESISTANCE.       Q. Whence is the word \"non-resistance\" derived?       A. From the command, \"Resist not evil.\" (M. v. 39.)       Q. What does this word express?       A. It expresses a lofty Christian virtue enjoined on us by     Christ.       Q. Ought the word \"non-resistance\" to be taken in its widest     sense--that is to say, as intending that we should not offer     any resistance of any kind to evil?       A. No; it ought to be taken in the exact sense of our Saviour's     teaching--that is, not repaying evil for evil.  We ought to     oppose evil by every righteous means in our power, but not by     evil.       Q. What is there to show that Christ enjoined non-resistance in     that sense?       A. It is shown by the words he uttered at the same time.  He     said: \"Ye have heard, it was said of old, An eye for an eye,     and a tooth for a tooth.  But I say unto you Resist not evil.     But if one smites thee on the right cheek, turn him the other     also; and if one will go to law with thee to take thy coat from     thee, give him thy cloak also.\"       Q. Of whom was he speaking in the words, \"Ye have heard it was     said of old\"?       A. Of the patriarchs and the prophets, contained in the Old     Testament, which the Hebrews ordinarily call the Law and the     Prophets.       Q. What utterances did Christ refer to in the words, \"It was     said of old\"?       A. The utterances of Noah, Moses, and the other prophets, in     which they admit the right of doing bodily harm to those who     inflict harm, so as to punish and prevent evil deeds.       Q. Quote such utterances.       A. \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be     shed.\"--GEN. ix. 6.       \"He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to     death... And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life     for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for     foot, burning for burning, "]]]
