Still, in the absence of the author, it  must be expected that some trifling errors and inaccuraci[e]s will have  here and there have crept in. In justice to others and himself, the  Editor, however, feels bound to acknowledge, with much gratitude, that  where such or even greater mistakes have been avoided, it has been  mainly due to the continued kindness of an Eastern scholar of more than  European reputation,-who has assisted in revising the sheets before  finally consigning them to the printer.    Let us hope that the proofs now furnished of untiring energy and  capacity for observation and research by our author, as well as his  ability to bear fatigue and exposure to the most inclement climate,  will induce the Governments of this country and of India to provide him  with men and means (evidently all that is required for the purpose) to  pursue his adventurous and useful career in other countries equally  difficult of access, and, if possible, of still greater interest, than  the Eastern shores of the Red Sea.    THOMAS L. WOLLEY.    Hampton Court Palace,    June, 1855.    [p.xxix] TO COLONEL WILLIAM SYKES, F.R.SOC., M.R.G.SOC., M.R.A.SOC.,    AND LORD RECTOR OF THE MARISCHAL COLLEGE, ABERDEEN.    I DO not parade your name, my dear Colonel, in the van of this volume,  after the manner of that acute tactician who stuck a Koran upon his  lance in order to win a battle. Believe me it is not my object to use  your orthodoxy as a cover to my heresies of sentiment and science, in  politics, political economy and-what not?    But whatever I have done on this occasion,-if I have done any  thing,-has been by the assistance of a host of friends, amongst whom  you were ever the foremost. And the highest privilege I aim at is this  opportunity of publicly acknowledging the multitude of obligations owed  to you and to them. Accept, my dear Colonel, this humble return for  your kindness, and ever believe me,    The sincerest of your well wishers,    RICHARD F. BURTON.

[FN#2] The brother-in-law, Barakat J'rayj'ray, has since that time  followed suit: educated at the Jesuit college of Mu'allakah (Libanus)  he has settled as a Greek Catholic priest at the neighbouring town of  Zahleh.

TO ALEXANDRIA.    A few Words concerning what induced me to a Pilgrimage.    IN the autumn of 1852, through the medium of my excellent friend, the  late General Monteith, I offered my services to the Royal Geographical  Society of London, for the purpose of removing that opprobrium to  modern adventure, the huge white blot which in our maps still notes the  Eastern and the Central regions of Arabia. Sir Roderick I. Murchison,  Colonel P. Yorke and Dr. Shaw, a deputation from that distinguished  body, with their usual zeal for discovery and readiness to encourage  the discoverer, honoured me by warmly supporting, in a personal  interview with the then Chairman of the then Court of Directors to the  then Honourable East India Company, my application for three years'  leave of absence on special duty from India to Maskat. But they were  unable to prevail upon the said Chairman, the late Sir James Hogg,  who,[FN#1] remembering the fatalities which of late years have befallen  sundry soldier-travellers in the East, refused his sanction, alleging  as a reason[FN#1]    [p.2]that the contemplated journey was of too dangerous a nature. In  compensation, however, for the disappointment, I was allowed the  additional furlough of a year, in order to pursue my Arabic studies in  lands where the language is best learned.    What remained for me but to prove, by trial, that what might be  perilous to other travellers was safe to me? The \"experimentum crucis\"  was a visit to Al-Hijaz, at once the most difficult and the most  dangerous point by which a European can enter Arabia. I had intended,  had the period of leave originally applied for been granted, to land at  Maskat-a favourable starting-place-and there to apply myself, slowly  and surely, to the task of spanning the deserts. But now I was to  hurry, in the midst of summer, after a four years' sojourn in Europe,  during which many things Oriental had faded away from my memory,  and-after passing through the ordeal of Egypt, a country where the  police is curious as in Rome or Milan-to begin with the Moslem's Holy  Land, the jealously guarded and exclusive Harim. However, being  liberally supplied with the means of travel by the Royal Geographical  Society; thoroughly tired of \"progress\" and of \"civilisation;\" curious  to see with my eyes what others are content to \"hear with ears,\"  namely, Moslem inner life in a really Mohammedan country; and longing,  if truth be told, to set foot on that mysterious spot which no vacation  tourist has yet described, measured, sketched and photographed, I  resolved to resume my old character of a Persian wanderer,[FN#2] a  \"Darwaysh,\" and to make the attempt.    [p.3]The principal object with which I started was this: to cross the  unknown Arabian Peninsula, in a direct line from either Al-Madinah to  Maskat, or diagonally from Meccah to Makallah on the Indian Ocean. By  what \"Circumstance, the miscreator\" my plans were defeated, the reader  will discover in the course of these volumes. The secondary objects  were numerous. I was desirous to find out if any market for horses  could be opened between Central Arabia and India, where the studs were  beginning to excite general dissatisfaction; to obtain information  concerning the Great Eastern wilderness, the vast expanse marked Rub'a  al-Khai (the \"Empty Abode\") in our maps; to inquire into the  hydrography of the Hijaz, its water-shed, the disputed slope of the  country, and the existence or non-existence of perennial streams; and  finally, to try, by actual observation, the truth of a theory proposed  by Colonel W. Sykes, namely, that if tradition be true, in the  population of the vast Peninsula there must exist certain physiological  differences sufficient to warrant our questioning the common origin of  the Arab family. As regards horses, I am satisfied that from the  Eastern coast something might be done-nothing on the Western, where the  animals, though thorough-bred, are mere \"weeds,\" of a foolish price and  procurable only by chance. Of the Rub'a al-Khali I have heard enough,  from credible relators, to conclude that its horrid depths swarm with a  large and half-starving population; that it abounds in Wadys, valleys,  gullies and ravines, partially fertilised by intermittent torrents;  and, therefore, that the land is open to the adventurous traveller.  Moreover, I am satisfied, that in spite of all geographers, from  Ptolemy to Jomard, Arabia, which abounds in fiumaras,[FN#3] possesses  not    [p.4]a single perennial stream worthy the name of river;[FN#4] and the  testimony of the natives induces me to think, with Wallin, contrary to  Ritter and others, that the Peninsula falls instead of rising towards  the south. Finally, I have found proof, to be produced in a future part  of this publication, for believing in three distinct races. 1. The  aborigines of the country, driven like the Bhils and other autochthonic  Indians, into the eastern and south-eastern wilds bordering upon the  ocean. 2. A Syrian or Mesopotamian stock, typified by Shem and Joktan,  that drove the Indigenae from the choicest tracts of country; these  invaders still enjoy their conquests, representing the great Arabian  people. And 3. An impure Syro-Egyptian clan-we personify it by Ishmael,  by his son Nabajoth, and by Edom, (Esau, the son of Isaac)-that  populated and still populates the Sinaitic Peninsula. And in most  places, even in the heart of Meccah, I met with debris of heathenry,  proscribed by Mohammed, yet still popular, while the ignorant observers  of the old customs assign to them a modern and a rationalistic origin.    I have entitled this account of my summer's tour through Al-Hijaz, a  Personal Narrative, and I have laboured to make its nature correspond  with its name, simply because \"it is the personal that interests  mankind.\" Many may not follow my example;[FN#5] but some    [p.5]perchance will be curious to see what measures I adopted, in order  to appear suddenly as an Eastern upon the stage of Oriental life; and  as the recital may be found useful by future adventurers, I make no  apology for the egotistical semblance of the narrative. Those who have  felt the want of some \"silent friend\" to aid them with advice, when it  must not be asked, will appreciate what may appear to the uninterested  critic mere outpourings of a mind full of self.[FN#6]    On the evening of April 3, 1853, I left London for Southampton. By the  advice of a brother officer, Captain (now Colonel) Henry Grindlay, of  the Bengal Cavalry,-little thought at that time the adviser or the  advised how valuable was the suggestion!-my Eastern dress was called  into requisition before leaving town, and all my \"impedimenta\" were  taught to look exceedingly Oriental. Early the next day a \"Persian  Prince,\" accompanied by Captain Grindlay, embarked on board the  Peninsular and Oriental Company's magnificent screw steamer \"Bengal.\"    [p.6]A fortnight was profitably spent in getting into the train of  Oriental manners. For what polite Chesterfield says of the difference  between a gentleman and his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4658"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 2 (#3)"],[1," light and flashy colour,  gamboge, yellow, tender green, or bright pink.    [p.15]This is the sign of a dressy man. If you have a single coat, it  should be of some modest colour, as a dark violet; to appear always in  the same tender green, or bright pink, would excite derision. But the  Hijazis, poor and rich, always prefer these tulip tints. The proper  Badan, or long coat without sleeves, still worn in truly Arab  countries, is here confined to the lowest classes. That ugliest of  head-dresses, the red Tunisian cap, called Tarbush,[FN#26] is much used,  only the Arabs have too much regard for their eyes and faces to wear  it, as the Turks do, without a turband. It is with regret that one sees  the most graceful head-gear imaginable, the Kufiyah and the Aakal,  proscribed except amongst the Sharifs and the Badawin. The women dress,  like the men, handsomely. Indoors they wear, I am told, a Sudayriyah,  or boddice of calico and other stuffs, like the Choli of India, which  supports the bosom without the evils of European stays. Over this is a  Saub, or white shirt, of the white stuff called Halaili or Burunjuk,  with enormous sleeves, and flowing down to the feet; the Sarwal or  pantaloons are not wide, like the Egyptians, but rather tight,  approaching to the Indian cut, without its exaggeration.[FN#27] Abroad,  they throw over the head a silk or a cotton Milayah, generally  chequered white and blue. The Burka (face-veil), all over Al-Hijaz is  white, a decided improvement in point of cleanliness upon that of  Egypt. Women of all ranks die the soles of the feet and the palms of  the hands black; and trace thin lines down the inside of the    [p.16]fingers, by first applying a plaster of henna and then a mixture,  called Shadar, of gall-nuts, alum, and lime. The hair[,] parted in the  centre, is plaited into about twenty little twists called  Jadilah.[FN#28] Of ornaments, as usual among Orientals, they have a  vast variety, ranging from brass and spangles to gold and precious  stones; and they delight in strong perfumes, musk, civet, ambergris,  attar of rose, oil of jasmine, aloe-wood, and extract of cinnamon. Both  sexes wear Constantinople slippers. The women draw on Khuff, inner  slippers, of bright yellow leather, serving for socks, and covering the  ankle, with Papush of the same material, sometimes lined with velvet  and embroidered with a gold sprig under the hollow of the foot. In  mourning the men show no difference of dress, like good Moslems, to  whom such display of grief is forbidden. But the women, who cannot  dissociate the heart and the toilette, evince their sorrow by wearing  white clothes and by doffing their ornaments. This is a modern custom:  the accurate Burckhardt informs us that in his day the women of  Al-Madinah did not wear mourning.    The Madani generally appear abroad on foot. Few animals are kept here,  on account, I suppose, of the expense of feeding them. The Cavalry are  mounted on poor Egyptian nags. The horses generally ridden by rich men  are generally Nijdi, costing from $200 to $300. Camels are numerous,  but those bred in Al-Hijaz are small, weak, and consequently little  prized. Dromedaries of good breed, called Ahrar[FN#29] (the noble) and  Namani, from the place of that name, are to be had for any sum between  $10 and $400; they are diminutive, but exceedingly swift, surefooted,  sagacious, thoroughbred, with eyes like the    [p.17]antelopes, and muzzles that would almost enter a tumbler. Mules  are not found at Al-Madinah, although popular prejudice does not now  forbid the people to mount them. Asses come from Egypt and Meccah: I am  told that some good animals are to be found in the town, and that  certain ignoble Badawi clans have a fine breed, but I never saw any. Of  beasts intended for food, the sheep is the only common one in this part  of Al-Hijaz. There are three distinct breeds. The larger animal comes  from Nijd and the Anizah Badawin, who drive a flourishing trade; the  smaller is a native of the country. Both are the common Arab species,  of a tawny colour, with a long fat tail. Occasionally one meets with  what at Aden is called the Berberah sheep, a totally different  beast,white, with a black broad face, a dew-lap, and a short fat tail,  that looks as if twisted up into a knot: it was doubtless introduced by  the Persians. Cows are rare at Al-Madinah. Beef throughout the East is  considered an unwholesome food, and the Badawi will not drink cows milk,  preferring that of the camel, the ewe, and the goat. The flesh of the  latter animal is scarcely ever eaten in the city, except by the poorest  classes.    The manners of the Madani are graver and somewhat more pompous than  those of any Arabs with whom I ever mixed. This they appear to have  borrowed from their rulers, the Turks. But their austerity and  ceremoniousness are skin-deep. In intimacy or in anger the garb of  politeness is thrown off, and the screaming Arab voice, the voluble,  copious, and emphatic abuse, and the mania for gesticulation, return in  all their deformity. They are great talkers as the following little  trait shows. When a man is opposed to more than his match in disputing  or bargaining, instead of patiently saying to himself, Sil crache il est  mort, he interrupts the adversary with a Sall ala Mohammed,Bless the  Prophet. Every good Moslem is obliged to obey such requisition by  responding, Allahumma    [p.18] salli alayh,O Allah bless him! But the Madani curtails the phrase  to An,[FN#30] supposing it to be an equivalent, and proceeds in his  loquacity. Then perhaps the baffled opponent will shout out Wahhid,  i.e., Attest the unity of the Deity; when, instead of employing the usual  religious phrases to assert that dogma, he will briefly ejaculate Al, and  hurry on with the course of conversation. As it may be supposed, these  wars of words frequently end in violent quarrels; for, to do the Madani  justice, they are always ready to fight. The desperate old feud between  the Juwwa, and the Barra,the town and the suburbshas been put down with the  greatest difficulty. The boys, indeed, still keep it up, turning out in  bodies and making determined onslaughts with sticks and stones.[FN#31]    It is not to be believed that in a town garrisoned by Turkish troops,  full of travelled traders, and which supports itself by plundering  Hajis, the primitive virtues of the Arab could exist. The Meccans, a  dark people, say of the Madani, that their hearts are black as their  skins are white.[FN#32] This is, of course, exaggerated; but it is not  too    [p.19] much to assert that pride, pugnacity, a peculiar point of honour  and a vindictiveness of wonderful force and patience, are the only  characteristic traits of Arab character which the citizens of  Al-Madinah habitually display. Here you meet with scant remains of the  chivalry of the Desert. A man will abuse his guest, even though he will  not dine without him, and would protect him bravely against an enemy.  And words often pass lightly between individuals which suffice to cause  a blood feud amongst Badawin. The outward appearance of decorum is  conspicuous amongst the Madani. There are no places where Corinthians  dwell, as at Meccah, Cairo, and Jeddah. Adultery, if detected, would be  punished by lapidation according to the rigour of the Koranic  law[FN#33]; and simple immorality by religious stripes, or, if of  repeated occurrence, by expulsion from the city. But scandals seldom  occur, and the women, I am told, behave with great decency.[FN#34]  Abroad, they have the usual Moslem    [p.20]pleasures of marriage, lyings-in, circumcision feasts, holy  isitations, and funerals. At home, they employ themselves with domestic  matters, and especially in scolding Hasinah and Zaafaran. In this occupation  they surpass even the notable English housekeeper of the middle orders  of societythe latter being confined to knagging at her slavey, whereas the  Arab lady is allowed an unbounded extent of vocabulary. At Shaykh Hamids  house, however, I cannot accuse the women of    Swearing into strong shudders  The immortal gods who heard them.    They abused the black girls with unction, but without any violent  expletives. At Meccah, however, the old lady in whose house I was  living would, when excited by the melancholy temperament of her eldest  son and his irregular hours of eating, scold him in the grossest terms,  not unfrequently ridiculous in the extreme. For instance, one of her  assertions was that hethe sonwas the offspring of an immoral mother;  which assertion, one might suppose, reflected not indirectly upon  herself. So in Egypt I have frequently heard a father, when reproving  his boy, address him by O dog, son of a dog! and O spawn of an Infidelof a  Jewof a Christian! Amongst the men of Al-Madinah I remarked a  considerable share of hypocrisy. Their mouths were as full of religious  salutations, exclamations, and hackneyed quotations from the Koran, as  of indecency and vile abusea point in which they resemble the Persians.  As before    [p.21] observed, they preserve their reputation as the sons of a holy  city by praying only in public. At Constantinople they are by no means  remarkable for sobriety. Intoxicating liquors, especially Araki, are  made in Al-Madinah, only by the Turks: the citizens seldom indulge in  this way at home, as detection by smell is imminent among a people of  water-bibbers. During the whole time of my stay I had to content myself  with a single bottle of Cognac, coloured and scented to resemble  medicine. The Madani are, like the Meccans, a curious mixture of  generosity and meanness, of profuseness and penuriousness. But the  former quality is the result of ostentation, the latter is a  characteristic of the Semitic race, long ago made familiar to Europe by  the Jew. The citizens will run deeply in debt, expecting a good season  of devotees to"]]]
