You begirt your parliament  With armed bands; and by this shameless farce,  There, in the very temple of great justice,  You forced the judges of the land to clear  The murderer of his guilt. You went still further--  O God!    MARY.      Conclude--nay, pause not--say for this  I gave my hand in marriage at the altar.    KENNEDY.  O let an everlasting silence veil  That dreadful deed: the heart revolts at it.  A crime to stain the darkest criminal!  Yet you are no such lost one, that I know.  I nursed your youth myself--your heart is framed  For tender softness: 'tis alive to shame,  And all your fault is thoughtless levity.  Yes, I repeat it, there are evil spirits,  Who sudden fix in man's unguarded breast  Their fatal residence, and there delight  To act their dev'lish deeds; then hurry back  Unto their native hell, and leave behind  Remorse and horror in the poisoned bosom.  Since this misdeed, which blackens thus your life,  You have done nothing ill; your conduct has  Been pure; myself can witness your amendment.  Take courage, then; with your own heart make peace.  Whatever cause you have for penitence,  You are not guilty here. Nor England's queen,  Nor England's parliament can be your judge.  Here might oppresses you: you may present  Yourself before this self-created court  With all the fortitude of innocence.    MARY.  I hear a step.    KENNEDY.          It is the nephew--In.        SCENE V.       The same. Enter MORTIMER, approaching cautiously.    MORTIMER (to KENNEDY).  Step to the door, and keep a careful watch,  I have important business with the queen.    MARY (with dignity).  I charge thee, Hannah, go not hence--remain.    MORTIMER.  Fear not, my gracious lady--learn to know me.       [He gives her a card.    MARY (She examines it, and starts back astonished).  Heavens! What is this?    MORTIMER (to KENNEDY).               Retire, good Kennedy;  See that my uncle comes not unawares.    MARY (to KENNEDY, who hesitates, and looks at the QUEEN inquiringly).  Go in; do as he bids you.       [KENNEDY retires with signs of wonder.        SCENE VI.       MARY, MORTIMER.    MARY.                From my uncle  In France--the worthy Cardinal of Lorrain?       [She reads.    \"Confide in Mortimer, who brings you this;  You have no truer, firmer friend in England.\"       [Looking at him with astonishment.    Can I believe it? Is there no delusion  To cheat my senses? Do I find a friend  So near, when I conceived myself abandoned  By the whole world? And find that friend in you,  The nephew of my gaoler, whom I thought  My most inveterate enemy?    MORTIMER (kneeling).                Oh, pardon,  My gracious liege, for the detested mask,  Which it has cost me pain enough to wear;  Yet through such means alone have I the power  To see you, and to bring you help and rescue.    MARY.  Arise, sir; you astonish me; I cannot  So suddenly emerge from the abyss  Of wretchedness to hope: let me conceive  This happiness, that I may credit it.    MORTIMER.  Our time is brief: each moment I expect  My uncle, whom a hated man attends;  Hear, then, before his terrible commission  Surprises you, how heaven prepares your rescue.    MARY.  You come in token of its wondrous power.    MORTIMER.  Allow me of myself to speak.    MARY.                 Say on.    MORTIMER.  I scarce, my liege, had numbered twenty years,  Trained in the path of strictest discipline  And nursed in deadliest hate to papacy,  When led by irresistible desire  For foreign travel, I resolved to leave  My country and its puritanic faith  Far, far behind me: soon with rapid speed  I flew through France, and bent my eager course  On to the plains of far-famed Italy.  'Twas then the time of the great jubilee:  And crowds of palmers filled the public roads;  Each image was adorned with garlands; 'twas  As if all human-kind were wandering forth  In pilgrimage towards the heavenly kingdom.  The tide of the believing multitude  Bore me too onward, with resistless force,  Into the streets of Rome. What was my wonder,  As the magnificence of stately columns  Rushed on my sight! the vast triumphal arches,  The Colosseum's grandeur, with amazement  Struck my admiring senses; the sublime  Creative spirit held my soul a prisoner  In the fair world of wonders it had framed.  I ne'er had felt the power of art till now.  The church that reared me hates the charms of sense;  It tolerates no image, it adores  But the unseen, the incorporeal word.  What were my feelings, then, as I approached  The threshold of the churches, and within,  Heard heavenly music floating in the air:  While from the walls and high-wrought roofs there streamed  Crowds of celestial forms in endless train--  When the Most High, Most Glorious pervaded  My captivated sense in real presence!  And when I saw the great and godlike visions,  The Salutation, the Nativity,  The Holy Mother, and the Trinity's  Descent, the luminous transfiguration  And last the holy pontiff, clad in all  The glory of his office, bless the people!  Oh! what is all the pomp of gold and jewels  With which the kings of earth adorn themselves!  He is alone surrounded by the Godhead;  His mansion is in truth an heavenly kingdom,  For not of earthly moulding are these forms!    MARY.  O spare me, sir! No further. Spread no more  Life's verdant carpet out before my eyes,  Remember I am wretched, and a prisoner.    MORTIMER.  I was a prisoner, too, my queen; but swift  My prison-gates flew open, when at once  My spirit felt its liberty, and hailed  The smiling dawn of life. I learned to burst  Each narrow prejudice of education,  To crown my brow with never-fading wreaths,  And mix my joy with the rejoicing crowd.  Full many noble Scots, who saw my zeal,  Encouraged me, and with the gallant French  They kindly led me to your princely uncle,  The Cardinal of Guise. Oh, what a man!  How firm, how clear, how manly, and how great!  Born to control the human mind at will!  The very model of a royal priest;  A ruler of the church without an equal!    MARY.  You've seen him then,--the much loved, honored man,  Who was the guardian of my tender years!  Oh, speak of him! Does he remember me?  Does fortune favor him? And prospers still  His life? And does he still majestic stand,  A very rock and pillar of the church?    MORTIMER.  The holy man descended from his height,  And deigned to teach me the important creed  Of the true church, and dissipate my doubts.  He showed me how the glimmering light of reason  Serves but to lead us to eternal error:  That what the heart is called on to believe  The eye must see: that he who rules the church  Must needs be visible; and that the spirit  Of truth inspired the councils of the fathers.  How vanished then the fond imaginings  And weak conceptions of my childish soul  Before his conquering judgment, and the soft  Persuasion of his tongue! So I returned  Back to the bosom of the holy church,  And at his feet abjured my heresies.    MARY.  Then of those happy thousands you are one,  Whom he, with his celestial eloquence,  Like the immortal preacher of the mount,  Has turned and led to everlasting joy!    MORTIMER.  The duties of his office called him soon  To France, and I was sent by him to Rheims,  Where, by the Jesuits' anxious labor, priests  Are trained to preach our holy faith in England.  There, 'mongst the Scots, I found the noble Morgan,  And your true Lesley, Ross's learned bishop,  Who pass in France their joyless days of exile.  I joined with heartfelt zeal these worthy men,  And fortified my faith. As I one day  Roamed through the bishop's dwelling, I was struck  With a fair female portrait; it was full  Of touching wond'rous charms; with magic might  It moved my inmost soul, and there I stood  Speechless, and overmastered by my feelings.  \"Well,\" cried the bishop, \"may you linger thus  In deep emotion near this lovely face!  For the most beautiful of womankind,  Is also matchless in calamity.  She is a prisoner for our holy faith,  And in your native land, alas! she suffers.\"       [MARY is in great agitation. He pauses.    MARY.  Excellent man! All is not lost, indeed,  While such a friend remains in my misfortunes!    MORTIMER.  Then he began, with moving eloquence,  To paint the sufferings of your martyrdom;  He showed me then your lofty pedigree,  And your descent from Tudor's royal house.  He proved to me that you alone have right  To reign in England, not this upstart queen,  The base-born fruit of an adult'rous bed,  Whom Henry's self rejected as a bastard.  [He from my eyes removed delusion's mist,  And taught me to lament you as a victim,  To honor you as my true queen, whom I,  Deceived, like thousands of my noble fellows,  Had ever hated as my country's foe.]  I would not trust his evidence alone;  I questioned learned doctors; I consulted  The most authentic books of heraldry;  And every man of knowledge whom I asked  Confirmed to me your claim's validity.  And now I know that your undoubted right  To England's throne has been your only wrong,  This realm is justly yours by heritage,  In which you innocently pine as prisoner.    MARY.  Oh, this unhappy right!--'tis this alone  Which is the source of all my sufferings.    MORTIMER.  Just at this time the tidings reached my ears  Of your removal from old Talbot's charge,  And your committal to my uncle's care.  It seemed to me that this disposal marked  The wond'rous, outstretched hand of favoring heaven;  It seemed to be a loud decree of fate,  That it had chosen me to rescue you.  My friends concur with me; the cardinal  Bestows on me his counsel and his blessing,  And tutors me in the hard task of feigning.  The plan in haste digested, I commenced  My journey homewards, and ten days ago  On England's shores I landed. Oh, my queen.

First, as to idea of the beautiful, Hegel begins by giving its  characteristics. It is infinite, and it is free; the contemplation of  the beautiful suffices to itself, it awakens no desire. The soul  experiences something like a godlike felicity and is transported into a  sphere remote from the miseries of life. This theory of the beautiful  comes very near that of Plato.    Secondly, as to beauty in nature. Physical beauty, considered  externally, presents itself successively under the aspects of regularity  and of symmetry, of conformity with a law, and of harmony, also of purity  and simplicity of matter.    Thirdly, beauty in art or the ideal is beauty in a higher degree of  perfection than real beauty. The ideal in art is not contrary to the  real, but the real idealized, purified, and perfectly expressed. The  ideal is also the soul arrived at the consciousness of itself, free and  fully enjoying its faculties; it is life, but spiritual life and spirit.  Nor is the ideal a cold abstraction, it is the spiritual principle under  the form of a living individuality freed from the laws of the finite.  The ideal in its highest form is the divine, as expressed in the Greek  divinities; the Christian ideal, as expressed in all its highest purity  in God the Father, the Christ, the Virgin. Its essential features are  calm, majesty, serenity.    At a lower degree the ideal is in man the victory of the eternal  principles that fill the human heart, the triumph of the nobler part of  the soul, the moral and divine principle.    But the ideal manifested in the world becomes action, and action implies  a form of society, a determinate situation with collision, and an action  properly so called. The heroic age is the best society for the ideal in  action; in its determinate situation the ideal in action must appear as  the manifestation of moral power, and in action, properly so called, it  must contain three points in the ideal: first, general principles;  secondly, personages; thirdly, their character and their passions. Hegel  winds up by considering the qualities necessary in an artist:  imagination, genius, inspiration, originality, etc.    A recent exponent of Hegel's aesthetical ideas further developed  expresses himself thus on the nature of beauty:--    \"After the bitterness of the world, the sweetness of art soothes and  refreshes us. This is the high value of the beautiful--that it solves  the contradiction of mind and matter, of the moral and sensuous world, in  harmony. Thus the beautiful and its representation in art procures for  intuition what philosophy gives to the cognitive insight and religion to  the believing frame of mind. Hence the delight with which Schiller's  wonderful poem on the Bell celebrates the accord of the inner and outer  life, the fulfilment of the longing and demands of the soul by the events  in nature. The externality of phenomena is removed in the beautiful; it  is raised into the circle of ideal existence; for it is recognized as the  revelation of the ideal, and thus transfigured it gives to the latter  additional splendor.\"    \"Thus the beautiful is active, living unity, full existence without  defect, as Plato and Schelling have said, or as recent writers describe  it; the idea that is quite present in the appearance, the appearance  which is quite formed and penetrated by the idea.\"    \"Beauty is the world secret that invites us in image and word,\" is the  poetical expression of Plato; and we may add, because it is revealed in  both. We feel in it the harmony of the world; it breaks forth in a  beauty, in a lovely accord, in a radiant point, and starting thence we  penetrate further and yet further, and find as the ground of all  existence the same charm which had refreshed us in individual forms.  Thus Christ pointed to the lilies of the field to knit His followers'  reliance on Providence with the phenomena of nature: and could they jet  forth in royal beauty, exceeding that of Solomon, if the inner ground of  nature were not beauty?    We may also name beauty in a certain sense a mystery, as it mediates to  us in a sensuous sign a heavenly gift of grace, that it opens to us a  view into the eternal Being, teaching us to know nature in God and God in  nature, that it brings the divine even to the perception of sense, and  establishes the energy of love and freedom as the ground, the bond, and  the end of the world.    In the midst of the temporal the eternal is made palpable and present to  us in the beautiful, and offers itself to our enjoyment. The separation  is suppressed, and the original unity, as it is in God, appears as the  first, as what holds together even the past in the universe, and what  constitutes the aim of the development in a finite accord.    The beautiful not only presents itself to us as mediator of a foreign  excellence or of a remote divinity, but the ideal and the godlike are  present in it. Hence aesthetics requires as its basis the system in  which God is known as indwelling in the world, that He is not far distant  from any one of us, but that He animates us, and that we live in Him.  Aesthetics requires the knowledge that mind is the creative force and  unity of all that is extended and developed in time and space.    The beautiful is thus, according to these later thinkers, the revelation  of God to the mind through the senses; it is the appearance of the idea.  In the beautiful spirit reveals itself to spirit through matter and the  senses; thus the entire man feels himself raised and satisfied by it. By  the unity of the beautiful with us we experience with delight that  thought and the material world are present for our individuality, that  they utter tones and shine forth in it, that both penetrate each other  and blend in it and thus become one with it. We feel one with them and  one in them.    This later view was to a great extent expressed by Schiller in his  \"Aesthetical Letters.\"    But art and aesthetics, in the sense in which these terms are used and  understood by German philosophical writers, such as Schiller, embrace a  wider field than the fine arts. Lessing, in his \"Laocoon,\" had already  shown the point of contrast between painting and poetry; and aesthetics,  being defined as the science of the beautiful, must of necessity embrace  poetry. Accordingly Schiller's essays on tragic art, pathos, and  sentimental poetry, contained in this volume, are justly classed under  his aesthetical writings.    This being so, it is important to estimate briefly the transitions of  German poetry before Schiller, and the position that he occupied in its  historic development.    The first classical period of German poetry and literature was contained  between A. D. 1190 and 1300. It exhibits the intimate blending of the  German and Christian elements, and their full development in splendid  productions, for this was the period of the German national epos, the  \"Nibelungenlied,\" and of the \"Minnegesang.\"    This was a period which has nothing to compare with it in point of  art and poetry, save perhaps, and that imperfectly, the heroic and  post-Homeric age of early Greece.    The poetical efforts of that early age may be grouped under--(1) national  epos: the \"Nibelungenlied;\" (2) art epos: the \"Rolandslied,\" \"Percival,\"  etc.; (3) the introduction of antique legends: Veldeck's \"Aeneide,\" and  Konrad's \"War of Troy;\" (4) Christian legends \"Barlaam,\" \"Sylvester,\"  \"Pilatus,\" etc.; (5) poetical narratives: \"Crescentia,\" \"Graf Rudolf,\"  etc.; (6) animal legends; \"Reinecke Vos;\" (7) didactic poems: \"Der  Renner;\" (8) the Minne-poetry, and prose.    The fourth group, though introduced from a foreign source, gives the  special character and much of the charm of the period we consider. This  is the sphere of legends derived from ecclesiastical ground. One of the  best German writers on the history of German literature remarks: \"If the  aim and nature of all poetry is to let yourself be filled by a subject  and to become penetrated with it; if the simple representation of  unartificial, true, and glowing feelings belongs to its most beautiful  adornments; if the faithful direction of the heart to the invisible and  eternal is the ground on which at all times the most lovely flowers of  poetry have sprouted forth, these legendary poems of early Germany, in  their lovely heartiness, in their unambitious limitation, and their pious  sense, deserve a friendly acknowledgment. What man has considered the  pious images in the prayer-books of the Middle Ages, the unadorned  innocence, the piety and purity, the patience of the martyrs, the calm,  heavenly transparency of the figures of the holy angels, without being  attracted by the simple innocence and humility of these forms, the  creation of pious artists' hands? Who has beheld them without tranquil  joy at the soft splendor poured, over them, without deep sympathy, nay,  without a certain emotion and tenderness? And the same spirit that  created these images also produced those poetical effusions, the same  spirit of pious belief, of deep devotion, of heavenly longing. If we  make a present reality of the heroic songs of the early German popular  poetry, and the chivalrous epics of the art poetry, the military  expeditions and dress of the Crusades, this legendary poetry appears as  the invention of humble pilgrims, who wander slowly on the weary way to  Jerusalem, with scollop and pilgrim's staff, engaged in quiet prayer,  till they are all to kneel at the Saviour's sepulchre; and thus  contented, after touching the holy earth with their lips, they return,  poor as they were, but full of holy comfort, to their distant home.    \"While the knightly poetry is the poetry of the splendid secular life,  full of cheerful joy, full of harp-tones and song, full of tournaments  and joyous festivals, the poetry of the earthly love for the earthly"]]]
