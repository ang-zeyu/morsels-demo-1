Many people mentioned in connexion with the specimens they brought  me have been more than kind in helping to collect the material  this volume contains; but its publication scarcely would have been  possible to me had it not been for the enthusiasm of one girl who  prefers not to be mentioned and the work of a seventeen-year-old  boy, Raymond Miller.  He has been my sole helper in many difficult  days of field work among the birds, and for the moths his interest  reached such a pitch that he spent many hours afield in search of  eggs, caterpillars, cocoons, and moths, when my work confined me  to the cabin.  He has carried to me many of my rarest cocoons,  and found in their native haunts several moths needed to complete  the book.  It is to be hoped that these wonderful days afield have  brought their own compensation, for kindness such as his I never  can reward adequately.  The book proves my indebtedness to the  Deacon and to Molly-Cotton.  I also owe thanks to Bob Burdette Black,  the oldest and warmest friend of my bird work, for many fine moths  and cocoons, and to Professor R. R. Rowley for the laborious task  of scientifically criticizing this book and with unparalleled  kindness lending a helping hand where an amateur stumbled.        CHAPTER II  MOTHS, EGGS, CATERPILLARS, WINTER QUARTERS      If you are too fastidious to read this chapter, it will be your  permanent loss, for it contains the life history, the evolution of  one of the most amazingly complicated and delicately beautiful  creatures in existence.  There are moths that come into the world,  accomplish the functions that perpetuate their kind, and go out,  without having taken any nourishment.  There are others that feed  and live for a season.  Some fly in the morning, others in the glare  of noon, more in the evening, and the most important class of big,  exquisitely lovely  ones only at night.  This explains why so many  people never have seen them, and it is a great pity, for the nocturnal,  non-feeding moths are birdlike in size, flower-like in rare and  complicated colouring, and of downy, silent wing.    The moths that fly by day and feed are of the Sphinginae group,  Celeus and Carolina, or Choerocampinae, which includes the  exquisite Deilephila Lineata, and its cousins; also Sphingidae,  which cover the clear-winged Hemaris diffinis and Thysbe.  Among  those that fly at night only and take no food are the members of  what is called the Attacine group, comprising our largest and  commonest moth, Cecropia; also its near relative Gloveri, smaller  than Cecropia and of lovely rosy wine-colour; Angulifera, the male  greyish brown, the female yellowish red; Promethea, the male  resembling a monster Mourning Cloak butterfly and the female  bearing exquisite red-wine flushings; Cynthia, beautiful in shades  of olive green, sprinkled with black, crossed by bands of pinkish  lilac and bearing crescents partly yellow, the remainder transparent.  There are also the deep yellow Io, pale blue-green Luna, and  Polyphemus, brown with pink bands of the Saturniidae; and light  yellow, red-brown and grey Regalis, and lavender and yellow  Imperialis of the Ceratocampidae, and their relatives.  Modest  and lovely Modesta belongs with the Smerinthinae group; and there  are others, feeders and non-feeders, forming a list too long to  incorporate, for I have not mentioned the Catocalae family, the  fore-wings of which resemble those of several members of the  Sphinginae, in colour, and when they take flight, the back ones  flash out colours that run the gamut from palest to deepest reds,  yellows, and browns, crossed by wide circling bands of black; with  these, occasionally the black so predominates that it appears as  if the wing were black and the bands of other colour.  All of them  are so exquisitely beautiful that neither the most exacting  descriptions, nor photographs from life, nor water colours faithfully  copied from living subjects can do them justice.  They must be seen  alive, newly emerged, down intact, colours at their most brilliant  shadings, to be appreciated fully.  With the exception of feeding  or refraining from eating, the life processes of all these are  very similar.    Moths are divided into three parts, the head, thorax, and abdomen,  with the different organs of each.  The head carries the source of  sight, scent, and the mouth parts, if the moth feeds, while the  location of the ears is not yet settled definitely.  Some  scientists place hearing in the antennae, others in a little organ  on each side the base of the abdomen.  Packard writes: \"The eyes  are large and globose and vary in the distance apart in different  families\":  but fails to tell what I want to know most: the range  and sharpness of their vision.  Another writer states that the eyes  are so incomplete in development that a moth only can distinguish  light from darkness and cannot discern your approach at over five feet.    This accords with my experience with Cecropia, Polyphemus,  Regalis, and Imperialis.  Luna either can see better, hear acutely,  or is naturally of more active habit.  It is difficult to capture  by hand in daytime; and Promethea acts as if its vision were even  clearer.  This may be the case, as it flies earlier in the day  than any of the others named, being almost impossible to take by  hand unless it is bound to a given spot by sex attraction.  Unquestionably the day fliers that feed--the Sphinginae and  Choerocampinae groups--have fairly good vision, as also the little  \"Clear-wings\" tribe, for they fly straight to the nectar-giving  flowers and fruits they like best to feed upon, and it is extra  good luck if you capture one by hand or even with a net.  It must  be remembered that all of them see and go to a bright light at  night from long distances.    Holland writes: \"The eyes of moths are often greatly developed,\"  but makes no definite statements as to their range of vision, until  he reaches the Catocalae family, of which he records:  \"The hind  wings are, however, most brilliantly coloured.  In some species  they are banded with pink, in others with crimson; still others have  markings of yellow, orange, or snowy white on a background of jet  black.  These colours are distinctive of the species to a greater  or less extent.  They are only displayed at night.  The conclusion  is irresistibly forced upon us that the eyes of these creatures are  capable of discriminating these colours in the darkness.  We cannot  do it.  No human eye in the blackness of the night can distinguish  red from orange or crimson from yellow.  The human eye is the greatest  of all anatomical marvels, and the most wonderful piece of animal  mechanism in the world, but not all of power is lodged within it.  There are other allied mechanisms which have the power of responding  to certain forms of radiant energy to a degree which it does not possess.\"    This conclusion is not \"irresistibly forced\" upon me.  I do believe,  know in fact, that all day-flying, feeding moths have keener sight  and longer range of vision than non-feeders; but I do not believe  the differing branches of the Catocalae group, or moths of any family,  locate each other \"in the blackness of night,\" by  seeing markings  distinctly.  I can think of no proof that moths, butterflies or any  insects recognize or appreciate colour.  Male moths mate with females  of their kind distinctly different from them in colour, and male  butterflies pair with albinos of their species, when these differ  widely from the usual colouring.    A few moths are also provided with small simple eyes called ocelli;  these are placed on top of the head and are so covered with down  they cannot be distinguished save by experts.  Mueller believes  that these are for the perception of objects close to a moth while  the compound eyes see farther, but he does not prove it.    If the moth does not feed, the mouth parts are scarcely developed.  If a feeder, it has a long tongue that can be coiled in a cleft in  the face between the palpi, which Packard thinks were originally  the feelers.  This tongue is formed of two grooved parts so  fastened together as to make a tube through which it takes flower  and fruit nectar and the juices of decaying animal matter.    What are thought by some to be small organs of touch lie on either  side the face, but the exact use of these is yet under discussion,  It is wofully difficult to learn some of these things.    In my experience the antennae, are the most sensitive, and  therefore the most important organs of the head--to me.  In the  Attacine group these stand out like delicately cut tiny fern  fronds or feathers, always being broader and more prominent on the  male.  Other families are very similar and again they differ  widely.  You will find moths having pointed hair-like antennae;  others heaviest at the tip in club shape, or they may be of even  proportion but flat, or round, or a feathered shaft so fine as to  be unnoticed as it lies pressed against the face.  Some writers say  the antennae are the seat of scent, touch, and hearing.  I had not  thought nature so impoverished in evolving her forms as to overwork  one delicate little organ for three distinct purposes.  The  antennae are situated close where the nose is, in almost every  form of life, and I would prefer to believe that they are the  organs of scent and feeling.  I know a moth suffers most over any  injury to them; but one takes flight no quicker or more precipitately  at a touch on the antennae than on the head, wing, leg, or abdomen.    We are safe in laying down a law that antennae are homologous organs  and used for identical purposes on all forms of life carrying them.  The short antennae of grasshoppers appear to be organs of scent.  The long hair-fine ones of katydids and crickets may be also, but  repeatedly I have seen these used to explore"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4908"],[0,"Five of Maxwell's Papers (#3)"],[1,"useful help in the  study of the other.    When he examines into the reason of this, he finds that in the two  sciences he has been dealing with systems of quantities, in which the  mathematical forms of the relations of the quantities are the same in  both systems, though the physical nature of the quantities may be  utterly different.    He is thus led to recognize a classification of quantities on a new  principle, according to which the physical nature of the quantity is  subordinated to its mathematical form.  This is the point of view  which is characteristic of the mathematician; but it stands second to  the physical aspect in order of time, because the human mind, in order  to conceive of different kinds of quantities, must have them presented  to it by nature.    I do not here refer to the fact that all quantities, as such, are  subject to the rules of arithmetic and algebra, and are therefore  capable of being submitted to those dry calculations which represent,  to so many minds, their only idea of mathematics.    The human mind is seldom satisfied, and is certainly never exercising  its highest functions, when it is doing the work of a calculating  machine.  What the man of science, whether he is a mathematician or a  physical inquirer, aims at is, to acquire and develope clear ideas of  the things he deals with.  For this purpose he is willing to enter on  long calculations, and to be for a season a calculating machine, if he  can only at last make his ideas clearer.    But if he finds that clear ideas are not to be obtained by means of  processes the steps of which he is sure to forget before he has  reached the conclusion, it is much better that he should turn to  another method, and try to understand the subject by means of  well-chosen illustrations derived from subjects with which he is more  familiar.    We all know how much more popular the illustrative method of  exposition is found, than that in which bare processes of reasoning  and calculation form the principal subject of discourse.    Now a truly scientific illustration is a method to enable the mind to  grasp some conception or law in one branch of science, by placing  before it a conception or a law in a different branch of science, and  directing the mind to lay hold of that mathematical form which is  common to the corresponding ideas in the two sciences, leaving out of  account for the present the difference between the physical nature of  the real phenomena.    The correctness of such an illustration depends on whether the two  systems of ideas which are compared together are really analogous in  form, or whether, in other words, the corresponding physical  quantities really belong to the same mathematical class.  When this  condition is fulfilled, the illustration is not only convenient for  teaching science in a pleasant and easy manner, but the recognition of  the formal analogy between the two systems of ideas leads to a  knowledge of both, more profound than could be obtained by studying  each system separately.    There are men who, when any relation or law, however complex, is put  before them in a symbolical form, can grasp its full meaning as a  relation among abstract quantities.  Such men sometimes treat with  indifference the further statement that quantities actually exist in  nature which fulfil this relation.  The mental image of the concrete  reality seems rather to disturb than to assist their contemplations.  But the great majority of mankind are utterly unable, without long  training, to retain in their minds the unembodied symbols of the pure  mathematician, so that, if science is ever to become popular, and yet  remain scientific, it must be by a profound study and a copious  application of those principles of the mathematical classification of  quantities which, as we have seen, lie at the root of every truly  scientific illustration.    There are, as I have said, some minds which can go on contemplating  with satisfaction pure quantities presented to the eye by symbols, and  to the mind in a form which none but mathematicians can conceive.    There are others who feel more enjoyment in following geometrical  forms, which they draw on paper, or build up in the empty space before  them.    Others, again, are not content unless they can project their whole  physical energies into the scene which they conjure up.  They learn at  what a rate the planets rush through space, and they experience a  delightful feeling of exhilaration.  They calculate the forces with  which the heavenly bodies pull at one another, and they feel their own  muscles straining with the effort.    To such men momentum, energy, mass are not mere abstract expressions  of the results of scientific inquiry.  They are words of power, which  stir their souls like the memories of childhood.    For the sake of persons of these different types, scientific truth  should be presented in different forms, and should be regarded as  equally scientific whether it appears in the robust form and the vivid  colouring of a physical illustration, or in the tenuity and paleness  of a symbolical expression.    Time would fail me if I were to attempt to illustrate by examples the  scientific value of the classification of quantities.  I shall only  mention the name of that important class of magnitudes having  direction in space which Hamilton has called vectors, and which form  the subject-matter of the Calculus of Quaternions, a branch of  mathematics which, when it shall have been thoroughly understood by  men of the illustrative type, and clothed by them with physical  imagery, will become, perhaps under some new name, a most powerful  method of communicating truly scientific knowledge to persons  apparently devoid of the calculating spirit.    The mutual action and reaction between the different departments of  human thought is so interesting to the student of scientific progress,  that, at the risk of still further encroaching on the valuable time of  the Section, I shall say a few words on a branch of physics which not  very long ago would have been considered rather a branch of  metaphysics.  I mean the atomic theory, or, as it is now called, the  molecular theory of the constitution of bodies.    Not many years ago if we had been asked in what regions of physical  science the advance of discovery was least apparent, we should have  pointed to the hopelessly distant fixed stars on the one hand, and to  the inscrutable delicacy of the texture of material bodies on the  other.    Indeed, if we are to regard Comte as in any degree representing the  scientific opinion of his time, the research into what takes place  beyond our own solar system seemed then to be exceedingly unpromising,  if not altogether illusory.    The opinion that the bodies which we see and handle, which we can set  in motion or leave at rest, which we can break in pieces and destroy,  are composed of smaller bodies which we cannot see or handle, which  are always in motion, and which can neither be stopped nor broken in  pieces, nor in any way destroyed or deprived of the least of their  properties, was known by the name of the Atomic theory.  It was  associated with the names of Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius, and  was commonly supposed to admit the existence only of atoms and void,  to the exclusion of any other basis of things from the universe.    In many physical reasonings and mathematical calculations we are  accustomed to argue as if such substances as air, water, or metal,  which appear to our senses uniform and continuous, were strictly and  mathematically uniform and continuous.    We know that we can divide a pint of water into many millions of  portions, each of which is as fully endowed with all the properties of  water as the whole pint was; and it seems only natural to conclude  that we might go on subdividing the water for ever, just as we can  never come to a limit in subdividing the space in which it is  contained.  We have heard how Faraday divided a grain of gold into an  inconceivable number of separate particles, and we may see Dr Tyndall  produce from a mere suspicion of nitrite of butyle an immense cloud,  the minute visible portion of which is still cloud, and therefore must  contain many molecules of nitrite of butyle.    But evidence from different and independent sources is now crowding in  upon us which compels us to admit that if we could push the process of  subdivision still further we should come to a limit, because each  portion would then contain only one molecule, an individual body, one  and indivisible, unalterable by any power in nature.    Even in our ordinary experiments on very finely divided matter we find  that the substance is beginning to lose the properties which it  exhibits when in a large mass, and that effects depending on the  individual action of molecules are beginning to become prominent.    The study of these phenomena is at present the path which leads to the  development of molecular science.    That superficial tension of liquids which is called capillary  attraction is one of these phenomena.  Another important class of  phenomena are those which are due to that motion of agitation by which  the molecules of a liquid or gas are continually working their way  from one place to another, and continually changing their course, like  people hustled in a crowd.    On this depends the rate of diffusion of gases and liquids through  each other, to the study of which, as one of the keys of molecular  science, that unwearied inquirer into nature's secrets, the late Prof.  Graham, devoted such arduous labour.    The rate of electrolytic conduction is, according to Wiedemann's  theory, influenced by the same cause; and the conduction of heat in  fluids depends probably on the same kind of action.  In the case of  gases, a molecular theory has been developed by Clausius and others,  capable of mathematical treatment, and"]]]
