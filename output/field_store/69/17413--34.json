By some means, however, he learned to read; and after that he  loved nothing so much as a good book.    There were no libraries near him, and it was hard for him to get books.  But he was anxious to learn. Whenever he could buy or borrow a volume  of prose or verse he carried it with him until he had read it through.  While watching his flocks, he spent much of his time in reading. He  loved poetry and soon began to write poems of his own. These poems  were read and admired by many people.    The name of James Hogg became known all over Scotland. He was often  called the Ettrick Shepherd, because he was the keeper of sheep near  the Ettrick Water.    Many of his poems are still read and loved by children as well as by  grown up men and women. Here is one:--          A BOY'S SONG          Where the pools are bright and deep,        Where the gray trout lies asleep,        Up the river and o'er the lea,        That's the way for Billy and me.          Where the blackbird sings the latest,        Where the hawthorn blooms the sweetest,        Where the nestlings chirp and flee,        That's the way for Billy and me.          Where the mowers mow the cleanest,        Where the hay lies thick and greenest,        There to trace the homeward bee,        That's the way for Billy and me.          Where the hazel bank is steepest,        Where the shadow falls the deepest,        Where the clustering nuts fall free,        That's the way for Billy and me.          Why the boys should drive away,        Little maidens from their play,        Or love to banter and fight so well,        That's the thing I never could tell.          But this I know, I love to play        In the meadow, among the hay--        Up the water, and o'er the lea,        That's the way for Billy and me.          THE CALIPH AND THE POET        Once upon a time there was a famous Arab [Footnote: Ar'ab.] whose name  was Al Mansur. He was the ruler of all the Arabs, and was therefore  called the caliph. [Footnote: Caliph (_pronounced_ ka'lif).]    Al Mansur loved poetry and was fond of hearing poets repeat their own  verses. Sometimes, if a poem was very pleasing, he gave the poet a  prize. One day a poet whose name was Thalibi [Footnote: Thal i'bi.]  came to the caliph and recited a long poem. When he had finished, he  bowed, and waited, hoping that he would be rewarded.    \"Which would you rather have\" asked the caliph, \"three hundred pieces  of gold, or three wise sayings from my lips?\"    The poet wished very much to please the caliph. So he said, \"Oh, my  master, everybody should choose wisdom rather than wealth.\"    The caliph smiled, and said, \"Very well, then, listen to my first wise  saying: When your coat is worn out, don't sew on a new patch; it will  look ugly.\"    \"Oh, dear!\" moaned the poet. \"There go a hundred gold pieces all at  once.\" The caliph smiled again. Then he said, \"Listen now to my second  word of wisdom. It is this: When you oil your beard, don't oil it too  much, lest it soil your clothing.\"    \"Worse and worse!\" groaned the poor poet. \"There go the second hundred.  What shall I do?\"    \"Wait, and I will tell you,\" said the caliph; and he smiled again. \"My  third wise saying is--\"    \"O caliph, have mercy!\" cried the poet. \"Keep the third piece of wisdom  for your own use, and let me have the gold.\"    The caliph laughed outright, and so did every one that heard him. Then  he ordered his treasurer to pay the poet five hundred pieces of gold;  for, indeed, the poem which he had recited was wonderfully fine.    The caliph, Al Mansur, lived nearly twelve hundred years ago. He was  the builder of a famous and beautiful city called Bagdad.          \"BECOS! BECOS! BECOS!\"        Thousands of years ago the greatest country, in the world was Egypt.    It was a beautiful land lying on both sides of the wonderful river  Nile. In it were many great cities; and from one end of it to the other  there were broad fields of grain and fine pastures for sheep and  cattle.    The people of Egypt were very proud; for they believed that they were  the first and oldest of all nations.    \"It was in our country that the first men and women lived,\" they said.  \"All the people of the world were once Egyptians.\"    A king of Egypt, whose name was Psammeticus, [Footnote: Psammeticus  (_pro._ sam met'i kus).] wished to make sure whether this was true or  not. How could he find out?    He tried first one plan and then another; but none of them proved  anything at all. Then he called his wisest men together and asked them,  \"Is it really true that the first people in the world were Egyptians?\"    They answered, \"We cannot tell you, O King; for none of our histories  go back so far.\"    Then Psammeticus tried still another plan.    He sent out among the poor people of the city and found two little  babies who had never heard a word spoken. He gave these to a shepherd  and ordered him to bring them up among his sheep, far from the homes  of men. \"You must never speak a word to them,\" said the king; \"and you  must not permit any person to speak in their hearing.\"    The shepherd did as he was bidden. He took the children far away to  a green valley where his flocks were feeding. There he cared for them  with love and kindness; but no word did he speak in their hearing.    They grew up healthy and strong. They played with the lambs in the  field and saw no human being but the shepherd.    Thus two or three years went by. Then, one evening when the shepherd  came home from a visit to the city, he was delighted to see the  children running out to meet him. They held up their hands, as though  asking for something, and cried out, \"Becos! becos! becos!\"    [Illustration]    The shepherd led them gently back to the hut and gave them their usual  supper of bread and milk. He said nothing to them, but wondered where  they had heard the strange word \"becos,\" and what was its meaning.    After that, whenever the children were hungry, they cried out, \"Becos!  becos! becos!\" till the shepherd gave them something to eat.    Some time later, the shepherd went to the city and told the king that  the children had learned to speak one word, but how or from whom, he  did not know.    \"What is that word?\" asked the king.    \"Becos.\"    Then the king called one of the wisest scholars in Egypt and asked him  what the word meant.    \"Becos,\" said the wise man, \"is a Phrygian [Footnote: Phrygian  (_pro_. frij'i an).] word, and it means _bread_.\"    \"Then what shall we understand by these children being able to speak  a Phrygian word which they have never heard from other lips?\" asked  the king.    \"We are to understand that the Phrygian language was the first of all  languages,\" was the answer. \"These children are learning it just as  the first people who lived on the earth learned it in the beginning.\"    \"Therefore,\" said the king, \"must we conclude that the Phrygians were  the first and oldest of all the nations?\"    \"Certainly,\" answered the wise man.    And from that time the Egyptians always spoke of the Phrygians as being  of an older race than themselves.    This was an odd way of proving something, for, as every one can readily  see, it proved nothing.          A LESSON IN HUMILITY        One day the caliph, Haroun-al-Raschid, [Footnote: Haroun-al-Raschid  (_pro._ ha roon' al rash'id).] made a great feast. The feast was  held in the grandest room of the palace. The walls and ceiling  glittered with gold and precious gems. The table was decorated with  rare and beautiful plants and flowers.    All the noblest men of Persia [Footnote: Per'sia.] and Arabia  [Footnote: A ra'bi a.] were there. Many wise men and poets and  musicians had also been invited.    In the midst of the feast the caliph called upon the poet, Abul Atayah,  [Footnote: A'bul Ata'yah.] and said, \"O prince of verse makers, show  us thy skill. Describe in verse this glad and glorious feast.\"    The poet rose and began: \"Live, O caliph and enjoy thyself in the  shelter of thy lofty palace.\"    \"That is a good beginning,\" said Raschid. \"Let us hear the rest.\" The  poet went on: \"May each morning bring thee some new joy. May each  evening see that all thy wishes have been performed.\"    \"Good! good!\" said the caliph, \"Go on.\"    The poet bowed his head and obeyed: \"But when the hour of death comes,  O my caliph, then alas! thou wilt learn that all thy delights were but  a shadow.\"    [Illustration]    The caliph's eyes were filled with tears. Emotion choked him. He  covered his face and wept.    Then one of the officers, who was sitting near the poet, cried out:  \"Stop! The caliph wished you to amuse him with pleasant thoughts, and  you have filled his mind with melancholy.\"    \"Let the poet alone,\" said Raschid. \"He has seen me in my blindness,  and is trying to open my eyes.\"    Haroun-al-Raschid (Aaron the Just) was the greatest of all the caliphs  of Bagdad. In a wonderful book, called \"The Arabian Nights,\" there are  many interesting stories about him.          THE MIDNIGHT RIDE            Listen, my children, and you shall hear      Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.                    Longfellow.      The midnight ride of Paul Revere happened a long time ago when this  country was ruled by the king of England.    There were thousands of English soldiers in Boston. The king had sent  them there to make the people obey his unjust laws. These soldiers  guarded the streets of the town; they would not let any one go out or  come in without their leave.    The people did not like this. They said, \"We have a right to be free  men, but the king treats us as slaves. He makes us pay taxes and gives  us nothing in return. He sends soldiers among us to take away our  liberty.\"    The whole country was stirred up. Brave men left their homes and  hurried toward Boston.    They said, \"We do not wish to fight against the king, but we are free"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/62"],[0,"A Princess of Mars (#3)"],[1,"when what seemed to be an  excellent trail opened up around the face of a high cliff.  The trail  was level and quite broad and led upward and in the general direction I  wished to go.  The cliff arose for several hundred feet on my right,  and on my left was an equal and nearly perpendicular drop to the bottom  of a rocky ravine.    I had followed this trail for perhaps a hundred yards when a sharp turn  to the right brought me to the mouth of a large cave.  The opening was  about four feet in height and three to four feet wide, and at this  opening the trail ended.    It was now morning, and, with the customary lack of dawn which is a  startling characteristic of Arizona, it had become daylight almost  without warning.    Dismounting, I laid Powell upon the ground, but the most painstaking  examination failed to reveal the faintest spark of life.  I forced  water from my canteen between his dead lips, bathed his face and rubbed  his hands, working over him continuously for the better part of an hour  in the face of the fact that I knew him to be dead.    I was very fond of Powell; he was thoroughly a man in every respect; a  polished southern gentleman; a staunch and true friend; and it was with  a feeling of the deepest grief that I finally gave up my crude  endeavors at resuscitation.    Leaving Powell's body where it lay on the ledge I crept into the cave  to reconnoiter.  I found a large chamber, possibly a hundred feet in  diameter and thirty or forty feet in height; a smooth and well-worn  floor, and many other evidences that the cave had, at some remote  period, been inhabited.  The back of the cave was so lost in dense  shadow that I could not distinguish whether there were openings into  other apartments or not.    As I was continuing my examination I commenced to feel a pleasant  drowsiness creeping over me which I attributed to the fatigue of my  long and strenuous ride, and the reaction from the excitement of the  fight and the pursuit.  I felt comparatively safe in my present  location as I knew that one man could defend the trail to the cave  against an army.    I soon became so drowsy that I could scarcely resist the strong desire  to throw myself on the floor of the cave for a few moments' rest, but I  knew that this would never do, as it would mean certain death at the  hands of my red friends, who might be upon me at any moment.  With an  effort I started toward the opening of the cave only to reel drunkenly  against a side wall, and from there slip prone upon the floor.          CHAPTER II    THE ESCAPE OF THE DEAD      A sense of delicious dreaminess overcame me, my muscles relaxed, and I  was on the point of giving way to my desire to sleep when the sound of  approaching horses reached my ears.  I attempted to spring to my feet  but was horrified to discover that my muscles refused to respond to my  will.  I was now thoroughly awake, but as unable to move a muscle as  though turned to stone.  It was then, for the first time, that I  noticed a slight vapor filling the cave.  It was extremely tenuous and  only noticeable against the opening which led to daylight.  There also  came to my nostrils a faintly pungent odor, and I could only assume  that I had been overcome by some poisonous gas, but why I should retain  my mental faculties and yet be unable to move I could not fathom.    I lay facing the opening of the cave and where I could see the short  stretch of trail which lay between the cave and the turn of the cliff  around which the trail led.  The noise of the approaching horses had  ceased, and I judged the Indians were creeping stealthily upon me along  the little ledge which led to my living tomb.  I remember that I hoped  they would make short work of me as I did not particularly relish the  thought of the innumerable things they might do to me if the spirit  prompted them.    I had not long to wait before a stealthy sound apprised me of their  nearness, and then a war-bonneted, paint-streaked face was thrust  cautiously around the shoulder of the cliff, and savage eyes looked  into mine.  That he could see me in the dim light of the cave I was  sure for the early morning sun was falling full upon me through the  opening.    The fellow, instead of approaching, merely stood and stared; his eyes  bulging and his jaw dropped.  And then another savage face appeared,  and a third and fourth and fifth, craning their necks over the  shoulders of their fellows whom they could not pass upon the narrow  ledge.  Each face was the picture of awe and fear, but for what reason  I did not know, nor did I learn until ten years later.  That there were  still other braves behind those who regarded me was apparent from the  fact that the leaders passed back whispered word to those behind them.    Suddenly a low but distinct moaning sound issued from the recesses of  the cave behind me, and, as it reached the ears of the Indians, they  turned and fled in terror, panic-stricken.  So frantic were their  efforts to escape from the unseen thing behind me that one of the  braves was hurled headlong from the cliff to the rocks below.  Their  wild cries echoed in the canyon for a short time, and then all was  still once more.    The sound which had frightened them was not repeated, but it had been  sufficient as it was to start me speculating on the possible horror  which lurked in the shadows at my back.  Fear is a relative term and so  I can only measure my feelings at that time by what I had experienced  in previous positions of danger and by those that I have passed through  since; but I can say without shame that if the sensations I endured  during the next few minutes were fear, then may God help the coward,  for cowardice is of a surety its own punishment.    To be held paralyzed, with one's back toward some horrible and unknown  danger from the very sound of which the ferocious Apache warriors turn  in wild stampede, as a flock of sheep would madly flee from a pack of  wolves, seems to me the last word in fearsome predicaments for a man  who had ever been used to fighting for his life with all the energy of  a powerful physique.    Several times I thought I heard faint sounds behind me as of somebody  moving cautiously, but eventually even these ceased, and I was left to  the contemplation of my position without interruption.  I could but  vaguely conjecture the cause of my paralysis, and my only hope lay in  that it might pass off as suddenly as it had fallen upon me.    Late in the afternoon my horse, which had been standing with dragging  rein before the cave, started slowly down the trail, evidently in  search of food and water, and I was left alone with my mysterious  unknown companion and the dead body of my friend, which lay just within  my range of vision upon the ledge where I had placed it in the early  morning.    From then until possibly midnight all was silence, the silence of the  dead; then, suddenly, the awful moan of the morning broke upon my  startled ears, and there came again from the black shadows the sound of  a moving thing, and a faint rustling as of dead leaves.  The shock to  my already overstrained nervous system was terrible in the extreme, and  with a superhuman effort I strove to break my awful bonds.  It was an  effort of the mind, of the will, of the nerves; not muscular, for I  could not move even so much as my little finger, but none the less  mighty for all that.  And then something gave, there was a momentary  feeling of nausea, a sharp click as of the snapping of a steel wire,  and I stood with my back against the wall of the cave facing my unknown  foe.    And then the moonlight flooded the cave, and there before me lay my own  body as it had been lying all these hours, with the eyes staring toward  the open ledge and the hands resting limply upon the ground.  I looked  first at my lifeless clay there upon the floor of the cave and then  down at myself in utter bewilderment; for there I lay clothed, and yet  here I stood but naked as at the minute of my birth.    The transition had been so sudden and so unexpected that it left me for  a moment forgetful of aught else than my strange metamorphosis.  My  first thought was, is this then death!  Have I indeed passed over  forever into that other life!  But I could not well believe this, as I  could feel my heart pounding against my ribs from the exertion of my  efforts to release myself from the anaesthesis which had held me.  My  breath was coming in quick, short gasps, cold sweat stood out from  every pore of my body, and the ancient experiment of pinching revealed  the fact that I was anything other than a wraith.    Again was I suddenly recalled to my immediate surroundings by a  repetition of the weird moan from the depths of the cave.  Naked and  unarmed as I was, I had no desire to face the unseen thing which  menaced me.    My revolvers were strapped to my lifeless body which, for some  unfathomable reason, I could not bring myself to touch.  My carbine was  in its boot, strapped to my saddle, and as my horse had wandered off I  was left without means of defense.  My only alternative seemed to lie  in flight and my decision was crystallized by a recurrence of the  rustling sound from the thing which now seemed, in the darkness of the  cave and to my distorted imagination, to be creeping stealthily upon me.    Unable longer to resist the temptation to escape this horrible place I  leaped quickly through the opening into the starlight of a clear  Arizona night.  The crisp, fresh mountain air outside the cave acted as  an immediate tonic and I felt new life and new courage coursing through  me.  Pausing upon the brink of the ledge I upbraided myself for what  now seemed to me wholly unwarranted apprehension.  I reasoned with  myself that I had lain helpless for many hours within the cave, yet  nothing had molested me, and my better judgment, when permitted the  direction of clear and logical reasoning,"]]]
