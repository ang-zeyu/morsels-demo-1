'You were speaking about its being a girl,' said Miss Betsey. 'I have no  doubt it will be a girl. I have a presentiment that it must be a girl.  Now child, from the moment of the birth of this girl--'    'Perhaps boy,' my mother took the liberty of putting in.    'I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl,' returned Miss  Betsey. 'Don't contradict. From the moment of this girl's birth, child,  I intend to be her friend. I intend to be her godmother, and I beg  you'll call her Betsey Trotwood Copperfield. There must be no mistakes  in life with THIS Betsey Trotwood. There must be no trifling with HER  affections, poor dear. She must be well brought up, and well guarded  from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved. I  must make that MY care.'    There was a twitch of Miss Betsey's head, after each of these sentences,  as if her own old wrongs were working within her, and she repressed any  plainer reference to them by strong constraint. So my mother suspected,  at least, as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire: too  much scared by Miss Betsey, too uneasy in herself, and too subdued and  bewildered altogether, to observe anything very clearly, or to know what  to say.    'And was David good to you, child?' asked Miss Betsey, when she had been  silent for a little while, and these motions of her head had gradually  ceased. 'Were you comfortable together?'    'We were very happy,' said my mother. 'Mr. Copperfield was only too good  to me.'    'What, he spoilt you, I suppose?' returned Miss Betsey.    'For being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world  again, yes, I fear he did indeed,' sobbed my mother.    'Well! Don't cry!' said Miss Betsey. 'You were not equally matched,  child--if any two people can be equally matched--and so I asked the  question. You were an orphan, weren't you?' 'Yes.'    'And a governess?'    'I was nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to  visit. Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me, and took a great deal of  notice of me, and paid me a good deal of attention, and at last proposed  to me. And I accepted him. And so we were married,' said my mother  simply.    'Ha! Poor Baby!' mused Miss Betsey, with her frown still bent upon the  fire. 'Do you know anything?'    'I beg your pardon, ma'am,' faltered my mother.    'About keeping house, for instance,' said Miss Betsey.    'Not much, I fear,' returned my mother. 'Not so much as I could wish.  But Mr. Copperfield was teaching me--'    ('Much he knew about it himself!') said Miss Betsey in a parenthesis.  --'And I hope I should have improved, being very anxious to learn, and  he very patient to teach me, if the great misfortune of his death'--my  mother broke down again here, and could get no farther.    'Well, well!' said Miss Betsey. --'I kept my housekeeping-book  regularly, and balanced it with Mr. Copperfield every night,' cried my  mother in another burst of distress, and breaking down again.    'Well, well!' said Miss Betsey. 'Don't cry any more.' --'And I am  sure we never had a word of difference respecting it, except when Mr.  Copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too much like each  other, or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines,' resumed my  mother in another burst, and breaking down again.    'You'll make yourself ill,' said Miss Betsey, 'and you know that will  not be good either for you or for my god-daughter. Come! You mustn't do  it!'    This argument had some share in quieting my mother, though her  increasing indisposition had a larger one. There was an interval of  silence, only broken by Miss Betsey's occasionally ejaculating 'Ha!' as  she sat with her feet upon the fender.    'David had bought an annuity for himself with his money, I know,' said  she, by and by. 'What did he do for you?'    'Mr. Copperfield,' said my mother, answering with some difficulty, 'was  so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to  me.'    'How much?' asked Miss Betsey.    'A hundred and five pounds a year,' said my mother.    'He might have done worse,' said my aunt.    The word was appropriate to the moment. My mother was so much worse  that Peggotty, coming in with the teaboard and candles, and seeing at a  glance how ill she was,--as Miss Betsey might have done sooner if there  had been light enough,--conveyed her upstairs to her own room with all  speed; and immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty, her nephew, who had been  for some days past secreted in the house, unknown to my mother, as a  special messenger in case of emergency, to fetch the nurse and doctor.    Those allied powers were considerably astonished, when they arrived  within a few minutes of each other, to find an unknown lady of  portentous appearance, sitting before the fire, with her bonnet tied  over her left arm, stopping her ears with jewellers' cotton. Peggotty  knowing nothing about her, and my mother saying nothing about her,  she was quite a mystery in the parlour; and the fact of her having a  magazine of jewellers' cotton in her pocket, and sticking the article  in her ears in that way, did not detract from the solemnity of her  presence.    The doctor having been upstairs and come down again, and having  satisfied himself, I suppose, that there was a probability of this  unknown lady and himself having to sit there, face to face, for some  hours, laid himself out to be polite and social. He was the meekest of  his sex, the mildest of little men. He sidled in and out of a room, to  take up the less space. He walked as softly as the Ghost in Hamlet,  and more slowly. He carried his head on one side, partly in modest  depreciation of himself, partly in modest propitiation of everybody  else. It is nothing to say that he hadn't a word to throw at a dog. He  couldn't have thrown a word at a mad dog. He might have offered him one  gently, or half a one, or a fragment of one; for he spoke as slowly as  he walked; but he wouldn't have been rude to him, and he couldn't have  been quick with him, for any earthly consideration.    Mr. Chillip, looking mildly at my aunt with his head on one side, and  making her a little bow, said, in allusion to the jewellers' cotton, as  he softly touched his left ear:    'Some local irritation, ma'am?'    'What!' replied my aunt, pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork.    Mr. Chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness--as he told my mother  afterwards--that it was a mercy he didn't lose his presence of mind. But  he repeated sweetly:    'Some local irritation, ma'am?'    'Nonsense!' replied my aunt, and corked herself again, at one blow.    Mr. Chillip could do nothing after this, but sit and look at her feebly,  as she sat and looked at the fire, until he was called upstairs again.  After some quarter of an hour's absence, he returned.    'Well?' said my aunt, taking the cotton out of the ear nearest to him.    'Well, ma'am,' returned Mr. Chillip, 'we are--we are progressing slowly,  ma'am.'    'Ba--a--ah!' said my aunt, with a perfect shake on the contemptuous  interjection. And corked herself as before.    Really--really--as Mr. Chillip told my mother, he was almost shocked;  speaking in a professional point of view alone, he was almost shocked.  But he sat and looked at her, notwithstanding, for nearly two hours,  as she sat looking at the fire, until he was again called out. After  another absence, he again returned.    'Well?' said my aunt, taking out the cotton on that side again.    'Well, ma'am,' returned Mr. Chillip, 'we are--we are progressing slowly,  ma'am.'    'Ya--a--ah!' said my aunt. With such a snarl at him, that Mr. Chillip  absolutely could not bear it. It was really calculated to break his  spirit, he said afterwards. He preferred to go and sit upon the stairs,  in the dark and a strong draught, until he was again sent for.    Ham Peggotty, who went to the national school, and was a very dragon at  his catechism, and who may therefore be regarded as a credible witness,  reported next day, that happening to peep in at the parlour-door an hour  after this, he was instantly descried by Miss Betsey, then walking to  and fro in a state of agitation, and pounced upon before he could make  his escape. That there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices  overhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude, from the  circumstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on  whom to expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest.  That, marching him constantly up and down by the collar (as if he had  been taking too much laudanum), she, at those times, shook him, rumpled  his hair, made light of his linen, stopped his ears as if she confounded  them with her own, and otherwise tousled and maltreated him. This was  in part confirmed by his aunt, who saw him at half past twelve o'clock,  soon after his release, and affirmed that he was then as red as I was.    The mild Mr. Chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time, if  at any time. He sidled into the parlour as soon as he was at liberty,  and said to my aunt in his meekest manner:    'Well, ma'am, I am happy to congratulate you.'    'What upon?' said my aunt, sharply.    Mr. Chillip was fluttered again, by the extreme severity of my aunt's  manner; so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile, to  mollify her.    'Mercy on the man, what's he doing!' cried my aunt, impatiently. 'Can't  he speak?'    'Be calm, my dear ma'am,' said Mr. Chillip, in his softest accents.    'There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness, ma'am. Be calm.'    It has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn't shake  him, and shake what he had to say, out of him. She only shook her own  head at him, but in a way that made him quail.

You should always try to think of these little things. Thinking of other  people's comfort makes them like you. Alice held Pincher, and we all  shouted, 'Kick! dig with your feet, for all you're worth!'    So Albert-next-door began to dig with his feet, and we stood on the  ground over him, waiting--and all in a minute the ground gave way, and  we tumbled together in a heap: and when we got up there was a little  shallow hollow where we had been standing, and Albert-next-door was  underneath, stuck quite fast, because the roof of the tunnel had tumbled  in on him. He is a horribly unlucky boy to have anything to do with.    It was dreadful the way he cried and screamed, though he had to own it  didn't hurt, only it was rather heavy and he couldn't move his legs. We  would have dug him out all right enough, in time, but he screamed so we  were afraid the police would come, so Dicky climbed over the wall, to  tell the cook there to tell Albert-next-door's uncle he had been buried  by mistake, and to come and help dig him out.    Dicky was a long time gone. We wondered what had become of him, and all  the while the screaming went on and on, for we had taken the loose earth  off Albert's face so that he could scream quite easily and comfortably.    Presently Dicky came back and Albert-next-door's uncle came with him. He  has very long legs, and his hair is light and his face is brown. He has  been to sea, but now he writes books. I like him.    He told his nephew to stow it, so Albert did, and then he asked him if  he was hurt--and Albert had to say he wasn't, for though he is a coward,  and very unlucky, he is not a liar like some boys are.    'This promises to be a protracted if agreeable task,' said  Albert-next-door's uncle, rubbing his hands and looking at the hole with  Albert's head in it. 'I will get another spade,' so he fetched the big  spade out of the next-door garden tool-shed, and began to dig his nephew  out.    'Mind you keep very still,' he said, 'or I might chunk a bit out of you  with the spade.' Then after a while he said--    'I confess that I am not absolutely insensible to the dramatic interest  of the situation. My curiosity is excited. I own that I should like to  know how my nephew happened to be buried. But don't tell me if you'd  rather not. I suppose no force was used?'    'Only moral force,' said Alice. They used to talk a lot about moral  force at the High School where she went, and in case you don't know what  it means I'll tell you that it is making people do what they don't want  to, just by slanging them, or laughing at them, or promising them things  if they're good.    'Only moral force, eh?' said Albert-next-door's uncle. 'Well?'    'Well,' Dora said, 'I'm very sorry it happened to Albert--I'd rather it  had been one of us. It would have been my turn to go into the tunnel,  only I don't like worms, so they let me off. You see we were digging for  treasure.'    'Yes,' said Alice, 'and I think we were just coming to the underground  passage that leads to the secret hoard, when the tunnel fell in on  Albert. He _is_ so unlucky,' and she sighed.    Then Albert-next-door began to scream again, and his uncle wiped his  face--his own face, not Albert's--with his silk handkerchief, and then  he put it in his trousers pocket. It seems a strange place to put a  handkerchief, but he had his coat and waistcoat off and I suppose he  wanted the handkerchief handy. Digging is warm work.    He told Albert-next-door to drop it, or he wouldn't proceed further  in the matter, so Albert stopped screaming, and presently his uncle  finished digging him out. Albert did look so funny, with his hair all  dusty and his velvet suit covered with mould and his face muddy with  earth and crying.    We all said how sorry we were, but he wouldn't say a word back to us. He  was most awfully sick to think he'd been the one buried, when it might  just as well have been one of us. I felt myself that it was hard lines.    'So you were digging for treasure,' said Albert-next-door's uncle,  wiping his face again with his handkerchief. 'Well, I fear that your  chances of success are small. I have made a careful study of the whole  subject. What I don't know about buried treasure is not worth knowing.  And I never knew more than one coin buried in any one garden--and that  is generally--Hullo--what's that?'    He pointed to something shining in the hole he had just dragged Albert  out of. Oswald picked it up. It was a half-crown. We looked at each  other, speechless with surprise and delight, like in books.    'Well, that's lucky, at all events,' said Albert-next-door's uncle.    'Let's see, that's fivepence each for you.'    'It's fourpence--something; I can't do fractions,' said Dicky; 'there  are seven of us, you see.'    'Oh, you count Albert as one of yourselves on this occasion, eh?'    'Of course,' said Alice; 'and I say, he was buried after all. Why  shouldn't we let him have the odd somethings, and we'll have fourpence  each.'    We all agreed to do this, and told Albert-next-door we would bring his  share as soon as we could get the half-crown changed. He cheered up a  little at that, and his uncle wiped his face again--he did look hot--and  began to put on his coat and waistcoat.    When he had done it he stooped and picked up something. He held it up,  and you will hardly believe it, but it is quite true--it was another  half-crown!    'To think that there should be two!' he said; 'in all my experience of  buried treasure I never heard of such a thing!'    I wish Albert-next-door's uncle would come treasure-seeking with us  regularly; he must have very sharp eyes: for Dora says she was looking  just the minute before at the very place where the second half-crown was  picked up from, and _she_ never saw it.        CHAPTER 3. BEING DETECTIVES    The next thing that happened to us was very interesting. It was as real  as the half-crowns--not just pretending. I shall try to write it as like  a real book as I can. Of course we have read Mr Sherlock Holmes, as  well as the yellow-covered books with pictures outside that are so badly  printed; and you get them for fourpence-halfpenny at the bookstall when  the corners of them are beginning to curl up and get dirty, with people  looking to see how the story ends when they are waiting for trains. I  think this is most unfair to the boy at the bookstall. The books are  written by a gentleman named Gaboriau, and Albert's uncle says they are  the worst translations in the world--and written in vile English. Of  course they're not like Kipling, but they're jolly good stories. And we  had just been reading a book by Dick Diddlington--that's not his right  name, but I know all about libel actions, so I shall not say what his  name is really, because his books are rot. Only they put it into our  heads to do what I am going to narrate.    It was in September, and we were not to go to the seaside because it is  so expensive, even if you go to Sheerness, where it is all tin cans and  old boots and no sand at all. But every one else went, even the people  next door--not Albert's side, but the other. Their servant told Eliza  they were all going to Scarborough, and next day sure enough all the  blinds were down and the shutters up, and the milk was not left any  more. There is a big horse-chestnut tree between their garden and ours,  very useful for getting conkers out of and for making stuff to rub on  your chilblains. This prevented our seeing whether the blinds were  down at the back as well, but Dicky climbed to the top of the tree and  looked, and they were.    It was jolly hot weather, and very stuffy indoors--we used to play a  good deal in the garden. We made a tent out of the kitchen clothes-horse  and some blankets off our beds, and though it was quite as hot in the  tent as in the house it was a very different sort of hotness. Albert's  uncle called it the Turkish Bath. It is not nice to be kept from the  seaside, but we know that we have much to be thankful for. We might be  poor little children living in a crowded alley where even at summer  noon hardly a ray of sunlight penetrates; clothed in rags and with bare  feet--though I do not mind holes in my clothes myself, and bare  feet would not be at all bad in this sort of weather. Indeed we do,  sometimes, when we are playing at things which require it. It was  shipwrecked mariners that day, I remember, and we were all in the  blanket tent. We had just finished eating the things we had saved, at  the peril of our lives, from the st-sinking vessel. They were rather  nice things. Two-pennyworth of coconut candy--it was got in Greenwich,  where it is four ounces a penny--three apples, some macaroni--the  straight sort that is so useful to suck things through--some raw rice,  and a large piece of cold suet pudding that Alice nicked from the larder  when she went to get the rice and macaroni. And when we had finished  some one said--    'I should like to be a detective.'    I wish to be quite fair, but I cannot remember exactly who said it.  Oswald thinks he said it, and Dora says it was Dicky, but Oswald is too  much of a man to quarrel about a little thing like that.    'I should like to be a detective,' said--perhaps it was Dicky, but I  think not--'and find out strange and hidden crimes.'    'You have to be much cleverer than you are,' said H. O.    'Not so very,' Alice said, 'because when you've read the books you know  what the things mean: the red hair on the handle of the knife, or the  grains of white powder on the velvet collar of the villain's overcoat. I  believe we could do it.'    'I shouldn't like to have anything to do with murders,' said Dora;  'somehow it doesn't seem safe--'    'And it always ends in the poor"]]]
