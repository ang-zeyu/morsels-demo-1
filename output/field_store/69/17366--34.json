This will be done by marshaling in its support  a more complete array of the old evidences than has been heretofore  made and the addition of new circumstantial evidence not heretofore  used in this connection.    It will be shown that Solomon Spaulding was much interested in American  antiquities; that he wrote a novel entitled the \"Manuscript Found,\" in  which he attempted to account for the existence of the American Indian  by giving him an Israelitish origin; that the first incomplete outline  of this story, with many features peculiar to itself and the Book of  Mormon, is now in the library of Oberlin College, and that while the  story as rewritten was in the hands of a prospective publisher, it  was stolen from the office under circumstances which caused Sidney  Rigdon, of early Mormon fame, to be suspected as the thief; that  later Rigdon, on two occasions, exhibited a similar manuscript which  in one instance he declared had been written by Spaulding and left  with a printer for publication. It will be shown further that Rigdon  had opportunity to steal the manuscript and that he foreknew the  forthcoming and the contents of the Book of Mormon; that through Parley  P. Pratt, later one of the first Mormon apostles, a plain and certain  connection is traced between Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith, and that  they were friends between 1827 and 1830. To all this will be added very  conclusive evidence of the identity of the distinguished features of  Spaulding's \"Manuscript Found\" and the Book of Mormon. These facts,  coupled with Smith's admitted intellectual incapacity for producing the  book unaided, will close the argument upon this branch of the question,  and it is hoped will convince all not in the meshes of Mormonism that  the Book of Mormon is a plagiarism. To those Mormons whose minds are  untainted by mysticism, who have the intelligence to weigh evidence  and the courage to proclaim convictions opposed to accepted church  theories--to such Mormons, though not convinced that the evidence here  reviewed amounts to a demonstration, it must be that this essay will  yet furnish even to them a more believable and more probable theory of  the origin of the Book of Mormon than the one which involves a belief  in undemonstrable miracles as well as matters entirely outside of all  other experience of sane humans. Certainly the theory here advanced  requires for its belief the acceptance of less of improbable assumption  than does any other explanation offered. With this statement of what  it is expected to accomplish we may proceed to review the evidence in  detail.    SOLOMON SPAULDING AND HIS FIRST MANUSCRIPT.    Solomon Spaulding was born in 1761 at Ashford, Conn., graduated from  Dartmouth in 1785, graduated in theology in 1787, and became an obscure  preacher. The fact that Spaulding had become an infidel, [5] that in  rewriting the first outline of his story he adopted, as he said, \"the  old Scripture style\" to make it seem more ancient, [6] and the further  fact that he told at least four persons at different times that his  story would some day be accepted as veritable history [7]--all of these,  combined with the peculiar product, tend to show that one motive for  the writing of this supposed novel may have been the author's desire  to burlesque the Bible and furnish a practical demonstration of the  gullibility of the masses.    [Footnote 5: See Addendum to Spaulding Manuscript at Oberlin College  and Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 288.]    [Footnote 6: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 288.]    [Footnote 7: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 283, 4, 6, 7.]    While at Dartmouth College, Spaulding had as a classmate the  subsequently famous imposter and criminal, Stephen Burroughs, [8] which  fact furnishes interesting material for reflection as to how far the  subsequent ill fame of Burroughs, coupled with personal acquaintance,  may have operated in Spaulding as a fruitful suggestion inducing this  labor as a means of securing fortune through fraud. If Spaulding  did not see the possibility of a new and profitable religion in his  \"Manuscript Found,\" then he was more short-sighted than was a nephew  of his named King. This nephew told one Hale, a schoolteacher, of his  belief that he could start a new religion out of this novel and make  money thereby, at the same time briefly outlining a plan very similar  to the one long afterward adopted by Smith, Rigdon and Company. If we  can place any confidence in the report of an interview between a Mormon  \"elder\" and a nephew of Solomon Spaulding, then it would appear that  in the opinion of the latter's brother Solomon Spaulding was not a man  who would be, by conscientious scruples, deterred from practicing such  a fraud, if believed profitable. [10] Be that as it may, Spaulding did  hope by the sale of his literary production to make sufficient money to  enable him to pay his debts. [11]    [Footnote 8: \"Memoirs of Stephen Burroughs,\" p. 26, ed. of 1811, shows  Burroughs to have entered Dartmouth in 1781, which must have been  Spaulding's date of entry, he having graduated in 1785.]    [Footnote 9: \"New Light on Mormonism,\" 261.]    [Footnote 10: xxxv. _Saints' Herald_, 820.]    [Footnote 11: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 285.]    In 1809 Solomon Spaulding and Henry Lake built and conducted a forge at  Salem (now Conneaut), O., where, in 1812, the former made his second  business failure. [12]    [Footnote 12: \"Prophet of Palmyra,\" 443; Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\"  279 and 282; \"New Light on Mormonism,\" 13.]    Spaulding, being an invalid, possessed of a good education and habits  of study, naturally took to literary work, which he probably commenced  soon after 1809, [13] and continued until his death in October, 1816.  During this seven years he seems to have written several other  manuscripts [14] besides the two with which we are directly concerned.    [Footnote 13: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 279; \"New Light on  Mormonism,\" 13-14.]    [Footnote 14: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 285; \"New Light on  Mormonism,\" 20.]    Necessarily Spaulding's surroundings gave some direction to the course  of his literary efforts. Environed as he was in a country where once  dwelt the mound-builders, and having himself caused one of the mounds  to be opened, with the resulting discovery of bones and relics of a  supposedly prehistoric civilization, [15] like thousands before him,  he was led to speculate upon the character of that civilization and  the origin of those ancient peoples. Josiah Priest, in his \"Wonders of  Nature and Providence\" (1824), quotes over forty authors, half of whom  are Americans, and all of whom, prior to 1824, advocated an Israelitish  origin of the American Indian. Some of these dated as far back as  Clavigaro, a Catholic priest in the seventeenth century.    [Footnote 15: \"New Light on Mormonism,\" 14.]    In Spaulding's first writing of his manuscript story, he pretended to  find a roll of parchment in a stone box within a cave. In the Latin  language, this contained an account of a party of Roman sea voyagers,  who, in the time of Constantine, were, by storms, drifted ashore on  the American continent. One of their number left this record of their  travels, of Indian wars and customs, which record Spaulding pretends to  have found and to translate. [16] How that resembles a synopsis of the  Book of Mormon!    [Footnote 16: \"The Manuscript Found.\" For Howe's synopsis see  \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 288. Whitney's \"History of Utah,\" 49-51.]    In 1834, when E. D. Howe had in preparation his book, \"Mormonism  Unveiled,\" wherein the Spaulding story was first exploited, this first  manuscript was given by Spaulding's family to D. P. Hurlburt, the agent  of Howe. The Spaulding family, without having made any examination  whatever of the papers delivered to Hurlburt, seem always to have  believed, [17] though without any evidence, that he received and sold  to the Mormons the rewritten story entitled \"Manuscript Found,\" which  will be more fully discussed hereafter. From Howe this first manuscript  story went into the possession of one L. L. Rice, who bought out Howe's  business, and later, with other effects of Rice's, it was shipped to  Honolulu, and there, in 1884, accidentally discovered by President  James H. Fairchild of Oberlin College. [18] This manuscript is now in  the Oberlin library, and has been published by two of the Mormon sects  as being a refutation of the Spaulding origin of the Book of Mormon. It  can be such refutation only to those who mistake it for another story.  Howe, in 1834, published a fair synopsis of the manuscript now at  Oberlin [19] and submitted the original to the witnesses who testified  to the many points of identity between Spaulding's \"Manuscript Found\"  and the Book of Mormon. These witnesses then (in 1834) recognized the  manuscript, secured by Hurlburt and now at Oberlin, as being one of  Spaulding's, but not the one which they asserted was similar to the  Book of Mormon. They further said that Spaulding had told them that he  had altered his original plan of writing by going farther back with his  dates and writing in the old Scripture style, in order that his story  might appear more ancient. [20]    [Footnote 17: \"New Light on Mormonism,\" by Mrs. Ellen F. Dickinson.]    [Footnote 18: Publisher's Preface to \"The Manuscript Found,\" p. iv.  _Deseret News_, 1886; Whitney's \"History of Utah,\" p. 49; Talmage's  \"Articles of Faith,\" 278-9.]    [Footnote 19: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 288; Whitney's \"History of  Utah,\" 49.]    [Footnote 20: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 288.]    According to many witnesses, the re-written \"Manuscript Found\" (like  the Book of Mormon) was an attempt at imitating the literary style of  the Bible. So was the manuscript submitted to Patterson, according to  his own statement.

In the days when Giotto lived the towns of Italy were continually  quarrelling with one another, and there was always fighting going on  somewhere. The cities were built with a wall all round them, and the  gates were shut each night to keep out their enemies. But often the  fighting was between different families inside the city, and the grim  old palaces in the narrow streets were built tall and strong that they  might be the more easily defended.    In the midst of all this war and quarrelling Giotto lived his quiet,  peaceful life, the friend of every one and the enemy of none. Rival  towns sent for him to paint their churches with his heavenly pictures,  and the people who hated Florence forgot that he was a Florentine. He  was just Giotto, and he belonged to them all. His brush was the white  flag of truce which made men forget their strife and angry passions,  and turned their thoughts to holier things.    Even the great poet Dante did not scorn to be a friend of the peasant  painter, and we still have the portrait which Giotto painted of him in  an old fresco at Florence. Later on, when the great poet was a poor  unhappy exile, Giotto met him again at Padua and helped to cheer some  of those sad grey days, made so bitter by strife and injustice.    Now when Giotto was beginning to grow famous, it happened that the Pope  was anxious to have the walls of the great Cathedral of St. Peter at  Rome decorated. So he sent messengers all over Italy to find out who  were the best painters, that he might invite them to come and do the  work.    The messengers went from town to town and asked every artist for a  specimen of his painting. This was gladly given, for it was counted a  great honour to help to make St. Peter's beautiful.    By and by the messengers came to Giotto and told him their errand. The  Pope, they said, wished to see one of his drawings to judge if he was  fit for the great work. Giotto, who was always most courteous, 'took a  sheet of paper and a pencil dipped in a red colour, then, resting his  elbow on his side, with one turn of the hand, he drew a circle so  perfect and exact that it was a marvel to behold.' 'Here is your  drawing,' he said to the messenger, with a smile, handing him the  drawing.    'Am I to have nothing more than this?' asked the man, staring at the  red circle in astonishment and disgust.    'That is enough and to spare,' answered Giotto. 'Send it with the rest.'    The messengers thought this must all be a joke.    'How foolish we shall look if we take only a round O to show his  Holiness,' they said.    But they could get nothing else from Giotto, so they were obliged to be  content and to send it with the other drawings, taking care to explain  just how it was done.    The Pope and his advisers looked carefully over all the drawings, and,  when they came to that round O, they knew that only a master-hand could  have made such a perfect circle without the help of a compass. Without  a moment's hesitation they decided that Giotto was the man they wanted,  and they at once invited him to come to Rome to decorate the cathedral  walls. So when the story was known the people became prouder than ever  of their great painter, and the round O of Giotto has become a proverb  to this day in Tuscany.         'Round as the O of Giotto, d' ye see;       Which means as well done as a thing can be.'      Later on, when Giotto was at Naples, he was painting in the palace  chapel one very hot day, when the king came in to watch him at his  work. It really was almost too hot to move, and yet Giotto painted away  busily.    'Giotto,' said the king, 'if I were in thy place I would give up  painting for a while and take my rest, now that it is so hot.'    'And, indeed, so I would most certainly do,' answered Giotto, 'if I  were in your place, your Majesty.'    It was these quick answers and his merry smile that charmed every one,  and made the painter a favourite with rich and poor alike.    There are a great many stories told of him, and they all show what a  sunny-tempered, kindly man he was.    It is said that one day he was standing in one of the narrow streets of  Florence talking very earnestly to a friend, when a pig came running  down the road in a great hurry. It did not stop to look where it was  going, but ran right between the painter's legs and knocked him flat on  his back, putting an end to his learned talk.    Giotto scrambled to his feet with a rueful smile, and shook his finger  at the pig which was fast disappearing in the distance.    'Ah, well!' he said, 'I suppose thou hadst as much right to the road as  I had. Besides, how many gold pieces I have earned by the help of thy  bristles, and never have I given any of thy family even a drop of soup  in payment.'    Another time he went riding with a very learned lawyer into the country  to look after his property. For when Bondone died, he left all his  fields and his farm to his painter son. Very soon a storm came on, and  the rain poured down as if it never meant to stop.    'Let us seek shelter in this farmhouse and borrow a cloak,' suggested  Giotto.    So they went in and borrowed two old cloaks from the farmer, and  wrapped themselves up from head to foot. Then they mounted their horses  and rode back together to Florence.    Presently the lawyer turned to look at Giotto, and immediately burst  into a loud laugh. The rain was running from the painter's cap, he was  splashed with mud, and the old cloak made him look like a very forlorn  beggar.    'Dost think if any one met thee now, they would believe that thou art  the best painter in the world?' laughed the lawyer.    Giotto's eyes twinkled as he looked at the funny figure riding beside  him, for the lawyer was very small, and had a crooked back, and rolled  up in the old cloak he looked like a bundle of rags.    'Yes!' he answered quickly, 'any one would certainly believe I was a  great painter, if he could but first persuade himself that thou dost  know thy A B C.'    In all these stories we catch glimpses of the good-natured kindly  painter, with his love of jokes, and his own ready answers, and all the  time we must remember that he was filling the world with beauty, which  it still treasures to-day, helping to sow the seeds of that great tree  of Art which was to blossom so gloriously in later years.    And when he had finished his earthly work it was in his own cathedral,  'St. Mary of the Flowers,' that they laid him to rest, while the people  mourned him as a good friend as well as a great painter. There he lies  in the shadow of his lily tower, whose slender grace and  delicate-tinted marbles keep his memory ever fresh in his beautiful  city of Florence.        FRA ANGELICO    Nearly a hundred years had passed by since Giotto lived and worked in  Florence, and in the same hilly country where he used to tend his sheep  another great painter was born.    Many other artists had come and gone, and had added their golden links  of beauty to the chain of Art which bound these years together. Some  day you will learn to know all their names and what they did. But now  we will only single out, here and there, a few of those names which are  perhaps greater than the rest. Just as on a clear night, when we look  up into the starlit sky, it would bewilder us to try and remember all  the stars, so we learn first to know those that are most easily  recognised--the Plough, or the Great Bear, as they shine with a clear  steady light against the background of a thousand lesser stars.    The name by which this second great painter is known is Fra Angelico,  but that was only the name he earned in later years. His baby name was  Guido, and his home was in a village close to where Giotto was born.    He was not a poor boy, and did not need to work in the fields or tend  the sheep on the hillside. Indeed, he might have soon become rich and  famous, for his wonderful talent for painting would have quickly  brought him honours and wealth if he had gone out into the world. But  instead of this, when he was a young man of twenty he made up his mind  to enter the convent at Fiesole, and to become a monk of the Order of  Saint Dominic.    Every brother, or frate, as he is called, who leaves the world and  enters the life of the convent is given a new name, and his old name is  never used again. So young Guido was called Fra Giovanni, or Brother  John. But it is not by that name that he is known best, but that of Fra  Angelico, or the angelic brother--a name which was given him afterwards  because of his pure and beautiful life, and the heavenly pictures which  he painted.    With all his great gifts in his hands, with all the years of youth and  pleasure stretching out green and fair before him, he said good-bye to  earthly joys, and chose rather to serve his Master Christ in the way he  thought was right.    The monks of St. Dominic were the great preachers of those days--men  who tried to make the world better by telling people what they ought to  do, and teaching them how to live honest and good lives. But there are  other ways of teaching people besides preaching, and the young monk who  spent his time bending over the illuminated prayer-book, seeing with  his dreamy eyes visions of saints and white-robed angels, was preparing  to be a greater teacher than them all. The words of the preacher monks  have passed away, and the world pays little heed to them now, but the  teaching of Fra Angelico, the silent lessons of his wonderful pictures,  are as fresh and clear to-day as they were in those far-off years.    Great trouble was in store for the monks of the little convent at  Fiesole, which Fra Angelico and his brother Benedetto had entered.  Fierce struggles were going on in Italy between different religious  parties, and at one time the little band of preaching monks were  obliged to leave their peaceful home at Fiesole to seek shelter in"]]]
