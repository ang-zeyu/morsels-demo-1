And he kept us kids company at times when there  was no work to be done.    But Grandpa was much more of a stranger to us than Grandma  Johnson was.  She lived only a half-mile away; we grew up with  her.  But I guess we hadn't seen Grandpa Gaddie more than once or  twice before he came to live with us.    Grandpa was never much of a bother in any way.  He was never  bedfast and never had to be waited on.  It didn't take much to  feed him.  We raised almost everything we ate and he brought  plenty of clothing with him when he came.  The entire family  didn't require much money, and we had plenty of other things in  life.    Grandpa was agreeable and compatible.  He was never grouchy.  He  had a room and a bed of his own in our home and he soon became  just one of the family and was accepted by all of us.    Then one morning Grandpa didn't come to breakfast.  A knock on  his door brought no answer.  Had he slipped out and gone for a  walk?  No one had noticed him out anywhere.  This was unusual for  Grandpa.  He was usually there on time for meals so the rest of  us wouldn't have to wait for him.  In our home no one ever  started helping his plate at meal time until all were seated and  the blessing was asked.    Papa knocked on Grandpa's door again, then he called to him, but  there was still no answer.  As Mama and Papa opened the door to  his room, there he was, still in bed, still asleep--but he was  not breathing.  It seemed that Grandpa just went to sleep and  didn't wake up.    Papa went to Hamlin that morning in a wagon and brought back a  casket.  The women dressed Grandpa in his best suit.  Some men  went to the graveyard and dug a grave.  Others went to tell the  preacher, and found him plowing in his field.  He stopped plowing  and went home to clean up and eat dinner.    Grandpa was placed in his casket and loaded into a wagon.  Then  about three o'clock we drove him to the Neinda graveyard where  the preacher and other friends were gathered.  And there, that  afternoon, we laid him away in his final resting place.    It's amazing sometimes, how a very little thing can stick in the  memory of a little boy, and that's the way it was this time, just  a simple little statement made by an older brother one morning--a  couple of mornings after we had buried Grandpa.  Four of us boys  slept in the west room of our home, the room usually referred to  as \"the boys room.\"  We boys were getting out of bed and getting  dressed when Frank said, \"Well, Grandpa's in heaven by now.\"  That was all he said.  That was enough.  After that, an air of  reverence filled the room.  And as we finished dressing, we left  the room one by one, in complete silence.  Frank had no way of  knowing how much I honored and respected him for that little  statement and the thought that went with it.  I was too young and  timid to know how to tell him.    That's about all of my childhood memories concerning the Gaddies.  In later years I had a desire to learn more about my mother's  people.  But as I began digging into census records, I soon found  that Grandma Gaddie had a first cousin by the name of Jesse  James-  -yes, that's right--\"The\" Jesse James.  So my desire suddenly  changed to fear and I gave up digging into records.          CHAPTER 2    EARLY CHILDHOOD AT THE FLINT FARM    The first farm we owned, the one where I was born, is still  spoken of as the Flint place, because we sold it to a family  named Flint.  So at times I may refer back to it as the Flint  place.    Since I was only five when we moved away from the Flint place, I  remember only a few things which took place while we lived there.    I remember we had old hens that laid eggs for us to go gather up  and take to the house in a bucket.  Sometimes the bucket would  get so heavy I couldn't carry it.  And sometimes we had to get  eggs out from under old setting hens that wouldn't get off their  nests.  They would peck me to keep me away.  I was too little to  get those eggs.  Mama or some of the bigger kids would have to  get them.    But if the old setting hen was off the nest, I knew which eggs to  get and which ones to leave in the nest.  The ones she was  setting on to hatch out little chickens were marked all over with  a lead pencil.  The ones that didn't have marks on them were  fresh eggs that had been laid that day.    Some city folks are confused at times about some of the words we  farmers use.  For instance, take the words sitting and setting.  The truth is, if an old hen is on an egg that she has just laid,  and if she is planning to go away in a minute or two, she is just  sitting on the egg.  But if she is on the egg or eggs with the  intention of hatching out little chickens, then she is not  sitting, she is setting.    Even some people who are supposed to be smart don't know farm  words.  In college English, the teacher had us making sentences  using certain double words like, \"_Look up_ a word in the  dictionary.\"  And \"_Hand over_ your gun.\"    I made a sentence like, \"The cow wouldn't _give down_ her milk.\"    The teacher gave me a zero on the sentence.  And when I asked her  why, she said, \"A cow can not _hold up_ her milk nor _give down_  her milk.\"    I told her, \"Lady, you may know your English, but you sure don't  know milk cows.\"    Now back to the Flint farm.    I was so little that, when I would throw out corn and maize seed  to feed the chickens, I couldn't throw it far enough away from  me.  Some of it would fall at my feet.  So the big chickens would  crowd around my feet to pick up the grains and I was afraid of so  many big hens so close to me.  And I really got scared when they  started pecking the feed out of my feed bucket.  Sometimes I  would drop the bucket and run away.    I remember seeing Papa digging up big trees where he was going to  make a field.  It wasn't far from our house.  Sometimes I would  go take him a drink of water.  And sometimes Mama would send me  to tell Papa dinner was ready.    While Papa was drinking his water and resting a bit, I liked to  get down in the big hole he dug around the bottom of a big tree.  The dirt was damp and cool in the hole.  Some of the holes were  so big and deep it was hard for me to crawl back out.    Sometimes our old surley (bull) was close by and I was afraid of  him, so Mama would leave me at the house to watch after Albert  while she took Papa a drink.  But if the cows were way over in  the other side of the pasture, I wasn't afraid to go.    I remember our garden just outside our yard.  I was big enough to  pick fresh beans and peas.  The older ones in the family taught  me how to break the peas off the vines without breaking the  vines.  Mama could pick them so easily, with just the right twist  of her hands.  But I had to hold the vine with one hand while I  twisted the peas off with the other hand.    I had the smartest Mama.  She could do so many things, and she  could do them so easily.    I especially remember one little incident that took place in our  home when I was three.  Most of the things I remember from my  early childhood have been almost forgotten and I now remember  them through special effort and recall.  But this one brief  moment has lived with me and was never put aside to be recalled  later.    Mama was sitting in a chair in our living room.  Albert was in  her lap getting his natural milk breakfast.  I was in a hurry for  the baby to get through nursing so I could play with him down on  the floor.  In the meantime, I was standing leaning against Mama  and playing with the baby--playing with his hands and feet,  rubbing and patting his \"tummy,\" and sometimes tickling him to  make him laugh.    Now all this activity caused a lot of wiggling and squirming in  Mama's lap.  And it also caused a lot of letting go of, and  getting back to, the baby's morning meal.  This kind of playing  with the baby might have aggravated some mothers and might have  brought a word of scorn, or at least an expression of impatient  dissatisfaction from them, but not from this mother.  She was one  of a kind.  She seemed to enjoy it all.  She was my Mama.    I was standing on Mama's left.  When Albert finished and was  full, Mama stood him down on the floor on her right.  And while  he was standing there holding to her dress for support, before  Mama put his breakfast away, back into her blouse, she looked  over at me and very motherly asked, \"Now, do you want some of the  baby's milk?\"    I didn't say a word.  I just bashfully backed away a step or so  and looked up at her and thought something like, \"That's for the  baby, not for me.\"    For the first time in my life I was consciously aware of my  mother's love for me, in that brief moment, because of that  simple little gesture.  The poet expressed it better than I can,  when he wrote, \". . .the love of a mother for her son that  transcends all other affections of the soul.\"  I was deeply moved  by the thought that, although she had another little one to hold  closely and love and nourish, she had not pushed me aside.  Her  love included me too.    As the years went by, sometimes all seemed hopeless and I would  ask myself, \"What the heck?  Who cares anyway?\"  And always that  little three-year-old kid would give me the answer, \"Mama does.\"    I remember the windmill by our garden and the water tank way up  high on the tower.  When the wind blew and the mill was pumping  water, we could open a faucet at the top of the well and get a  drink of fresh cold water.  We had a tin cup hanging on a nail on  the windmill tower to drink out of.  And we kept some water  hanging up on our back porch in a wooden water bucket made out of  cedar.  There was a dipper in the bucket that we all drank out  of.    Once when Papa was building his big barn at the Flint place,  before he got it finished, a strong wind hit it and leaned it way  over, but it didn't blow it all the way down.  Papa"]]]
