But before we reached the gate we  glanced to our left, along the grassy, spruce-bordered lane which led  over to Uncle Roger's; and at the entrance of that lane we saw a girl  standing, with a gray cat at her feet. She lifted her hand and beckoned  blithely to us; and, the orchard forgotten, we followed her summons. For  we knew that this must be the Story Girl; and in that gay and graceful  gesture was an allurement not to be gainsaid or denied.    We looked at her as we drew near with such interest that we forgot to  feel shy. No, she was not pretty. She was tall for her fourteen years,  slim and straight; around her long, white face--rather too long and too  white--fell sleek, dark-brown curls, tied above either ear with rosettes  of scarlet ribbon. Her large, curving mouth was as red as a poppy, and  she had brilliant, almond-shaped, hazel eyes; but we did not think her  pretty.    Then she spoke; she said,    \"Good morning.\"    Never had we heard a voice like hers. Never, in all my life since, have  I heard such a voice. I cannot describe it. I might say it was clear; I  might say it was sweet; I might say it was vibrant and far-reaching and  bell-like; all this would be true, but it would give you no real idea of  the peculiar quality which made the Story Girl's voice what it was.    If voices had colour, hers would have been like a rainbow. It made words  LIVE. Whatever she said became a breathing entity, not a mere verbal  statement or utterance. Felix and I were too young to understand or  analyze the impression it made upon us; but we instantly felt at her  greeting that it WAS a good morning--a surpassingly good morning--the  very best morning that had ever happened in this most excellent of  worlds.    \"You are Felix and Beverley,\" she went on, shaking our hands with an air  of frank comradeship, which was very different from the shy, feminine  advances of Felicity and Cecily. From that moment we were as good  friends as if we had known each other for a hundred years. \"I am glad to  see you. I was so disappointed I couldn't go over last night. I got up  early this morning, though, for I felt sure you would be up early, too,  and that you'd like to have me tell you about things. I can tell things  so much better than Felicity or Cecily. Do you think Felicity is VERY  pretty?\"    \"She's the prettiest girl I ever saw,\" I said enthusiastically,  remembering that Felicity had called me handsome.    \"The boys all think so,\" said the Story Girl, not, I fancied, quite well  pleased. \"And I suppose she is. She is a splendid cook, too, though she  is only twelve. I can't cook. I am trying to learn, but I don't make  much progress. Aunt Olivia says I haven't enough natural gumption ever  to be a cook; but I'd love to be able to make as good cakes and pies as  Felicity can make. But then, Felicity is stupid. It's not ill-natured  of me to say that. It's just the truth, and you'd soon find it out for  yourselves. I like Felicity very well, but she IS stupid. Cecily is ever  so much cleverer. Cecily's a dear. So is Uncle Alec; and Aunt Janet is  pretty nice, too.\"    \"What is Aunt Olivia like?\" asked Felix.    \"Aunt Olivia is very pretty. She is just like a pansy--all velvety and  purply and goldy.\"    Felix and I SAW, somewhere inside of our heads, a velvet and purple and  gold pansy-woman, just as the Story Girl spoke.    \"But is she NICE?\" I asked. That was the main question about grown-ups.  Their looks mattered little to us.    \"She is lovely. But she is twenty-nine, you know. That's pretty old. She  doesn't bother me much. Aunt Janet says that I'd have no bringing up at  all, if it wasn't for her. Aunt Olivia says children should just be let  COME up--that everything else is settled for them long before they are  born. I don't understand that. Do you?\"    No, we did not. But it was our experience that grown-ups had a habit of  saying things hard to understand.    \"What is Uncle Roger like?\" was our next question.    \"Well, I like Uncle Roger,\" said the Story Girl meditatively. \"He is big  and jolly. But he teases people too much. You ask him a serious question  and you get a ridiculous answer. He hardly ever scolds or gets cross,  though, and THAT is something. He is an old bachelor.\"    \"Doesn't he ever mean to get married?\" asked Felix.    \"I don't know. Aunt Olivia wishes he would, because she's tired keeping  house for him, and she wants to go to Aunt Julia in California. But she  says he'll never get married, because he is looking for perfection, and  when he finds her she won't have HIM.\"    By this time we were all sitting down on the gnarled roots of the  spruces, and the big gray cat came over and made friends with us. He was  a lordly animal, with a silver-gray coat beautifully marked with darker  stripes. With such colouring most cats would have had white or silver  feet; but he had four black paws and a black nose. Such points gave him  an air of distinction, and marked him out as quite different from the  common or garden variety of cats. He seemed to be a cat with a tolerably  good opinion of himself, and his response to our advances was slightly  tinged with condescension.    \"This isn't Topsy, is it?\" I asked. I knew at once that the question was  a foolish one. Topsy, the cat of which father had talked, had flourished  thirty years before, and all her nine lives could scarcely have lasted  so long.    \"No, but it is Topsy's great-great-great-great-grandson,\" said the Story  Girl gravely. \"His name is Paddy and he is my own particular cat. We  have barn cats, but Paddy never associates with them. I am very good  friends with all cats. They are so sleek and comfortable and dignified.  And it is so easy to make them happy. Oh, I'm so glad you boys have come  to live here. Nothing ever happens here, except days, so we have to make  our own good times. We were short of boys before--only Dan and Peter to  four girls.\"    \"FOUR girls? Oh, yes, Sara Ray. Felicity mentioned her. What is she  like? Where does she live?\"    \"Just down the hill. You can't see the house for the spruce bush. Sara  is a nice girl. She's only eleven, and her mother is dreadfully strict.  She never allows Sara to read a single story. JUST you fancy! Sara's  conscience is always troubling her for doing things she's sure her  mother won't approve, but it never prevents her from doing them. It  only spoils her fun. Uncle Roger says that a mother who won't let you do  anything, and a conscience that won't let you enjoy anything is an awful  combination, and he doesn't wonder Sara is pale and thin and nervous.  But, between you and me, I believe the real reason is that her mother  doesn't give her half enough to eat. Not that she's mean, you know--but  she thinks it isn't healthy for children to eat much, or anything but  certain things. Isn't it fortunate we weren't born into that sort of a  family?\"    \"I think it's awfully lucky we were all born into the same family,\"  Felix remarked.    \"Isn't it? I've often thought so. And I've often thought what a dreadful  thing it would have been if Grandfather and Grandmother King had never  got married to each other. I don't suppose there would have been a  single one of us children here at all; or if we were, we would be part  somebody else and that would be almost as bad. When I think it all over  I can't feel too thankful that Grandfather and Grandmother King happened  to marry each other, when there were so many other people they might  have married.\"    Felix and I shivered. We felt suddenly that we had escaped a dreadful  danger--the danger of having been born somebody else. But it took  the Story Girl to make us realize just how dreadful it was and what a  terrible risk we had run years before we, or our parents either, had  existed.    \"Who lives over there?\" I asked, pointing to a house across the fields.    \"Oh, that belongs to the Awkward Man. His name is Jasper Dale, but  everybody calls him the Awkward Man. And they do say he writes poetry.  He calls his place Golden Milestone. I know why, because I've read  Longfellow's poems. He never goes into society because he is so awkward.  The girls laugh at him and he doesn't like it. I know a story about him  and I'll tell it to you sometime.\"    \"And who lives in that other house?\" asked Felix, looking over the  westering valley where a little gray roof was visible among the trees.    \"Old Peg Bowen. She's very queer. She lives there with a lot of pet  animals in winter, and in summer she roams over the country and begs her  meals. They say she is crazy. People have always tried to frighten us  children into good behaviour by telling us that Peg Bowen would catch us  if we didn't behave. I'm not so frightened of her as I once was, but  I don't think I would like to be caught by her. Sara Ray is dreadfully  scared of her. Peter Craig says she is a witch and that he bets she's at  the bottom of it when the butter won't come. But I don't believe THAT.  Witches are so scarce nowadays. There may be some somewhere in the  world, but it's not likely there are any here right in Prince Edward  Island. They used to be very plenty long ago. I know some splendid witch  stories I'll tell you some day. They'll just make your blood freeze in  your veins.\"    We hadn't a doubt of it. If anybody could freeze the blood in our veins  this girl with the wonderful voice could. But it was a May morning, and  our young blood was running blithely in our veins. We suggested a visit  to the orchard would be more agreeable.    \"All right. I know stories about it, too,\" she said, as we walked across  the yard, followed by Paddy of the waving tail. \"Oh, aren't you glad it  is spring? The beauty of winter is that it makes you appreciate spring.\"    The latch of the gate clicked under the Story Girl's hand, and the next  moment we were in the King orchard.        CHAPTER III. LEGENDS OF THE"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53499"],[0,"Martin Luther (#3)"],[1,"on the condition that  his opponents would remain silent too.        [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]          THE BREACH WIDENS                               Pushed into the Arena    Even while Luther was meeting with Miltitz circumstances were shaping up  which drove him to break silence. He had stated his willingness to  recant if someone proved his error. An ambitious professor at the  University of Ingolstadt, John Eck, with an enviable reputation as a  disputant, saw in this his opportunity to win renown and also favor with  Rome.    Andrew Carlstadt of the Wittenberg faculty had espoused the cause of  Luther publicly and had been engaged in an extended debate with Eck  through the medium of pamphlets. Now a public debate between the two was  arranged for Leipzig. In preparation Eck drew up a series of twelve  theses, directed not so much at his differences with Carlstadt as with  the theology of Luther. The champion of Roman orthodoxy clearly was  baiting Luther into the arena.    After months of wrangling about procedures and proper invitations, and  with much pomp and pageantry, the debate got under way on June 27, 1519.  Several hundred Wittenberg students were there--a sixteenth-century sort  of college cheering section. During the ensuing eighteen days of debate  they frequently became embroiled with the Leipzig University students  who sided with Eck. Carlstadt and Eck matched wits for four days over  the relation between grace and free will. The erudition and cleverness  of Eck gave him a decided advantage over the Wittenberg scholar, but  spectator interest was being reserved for July 4 when Luther would take  the field.    For another four days Eck and Luther discussed the divine right of the  pope with the Ingolstadter insisting that the divine plan of government  was a monarchy with the pope at its head. Luther agreed that the church  was a monarchy but that Christ was its head. The passage in St. Matthew  concerning the rock upon which Christ would build his church was quoted  by Eck with the interpretation that Peter was the \"rock\" and since he  also was the first pope it was clear that papal supremacy had been  established by Christ.    Luther declared the passage should be considered along with Peter's  previous statement, \"Thou art the Christ....\" This confession, he said,  is the \"rock\" on which Christ built his church.                                 The Shadow of Hus    The crisis at Leipzig was reached when Eck backed into a dialectical  corner and had to resort to foul tactics. How discredit Luther? Perhaps  if he made him synonymous with heresy....    Craftily Eck pointed out the similarity between Luther's arguments and  those of the Bohemian reformer, John Hus, whom the Council of Constance  had condemned to the stake a century before. Luther denounced the  insinuation and declared the Bohemian heresy irrelevant to the debate.    It was inevitable in opposing the Roman Church's contention to primacy  that Luther would use arguments similar to those of previous reformers.  The condemnation of Hus as a heretic did not necessarily make all of his  views heretical. In fact, Luther insisted, some of Hus's articles were  genuinely Christian and evangelical.    The spectators and visiting theologians were stunned, and perhaps Luther  shocked even himself. Clearly his remark would be interpreted to mean  that the general councils--the highest earthly authority--were not  beyond fault. This was heresy.    Luther had long been aware of the need for reform in the church. As his  ideas developed it became apparent that the pope was not above human  weakness. The church militant needed an earthly head, and for the sake  of good order it was necessary that he be obeyed. But that didn't make  him infallible. After all, he was human.    Now this same reasoning had pushed from Luther's lips the admission that  councils could err also. Unwittingly Eck had contributed what probably  was the greatest outcome of the debate--Luther's growing conviction that  even general councils could be unreliable. Henceforth he would take his  stand on the unassailable Word of God as revealed in the Scriptures.    Results of the debate were weighed by judges at the University of Paris  who condemned Luther and his views as heretical. When Philip  Melanchthon, a Wittenberg associate and close friend of Luther,  questioned the opinion on the basis of Scripture, the Parisians looked  down their noses at the upstart, informing him they were chief among the  few to whom interpretation of Scripture could be entrusted.                              For Such a Time as This    Luther was frankly disappointed with the outcome of the debate. He had  hoped his opinions would be accepted and reformation of the church  effected.    The controversy did much, however, to crystallize his own views: The  pope did not have absolute authority; a council can err in its  decisions; the Bible is above popes and councils in authority; the  Church of Christ is not limited to the Roman fellowship alone but is the  community of believers throughout the world.    Gradually Luther realized these views differed so fundamentally from  those of Rome that there was small chance of healing the breach. The  notion that he might become a martyr recurred frequently but it didn't  cause him to relinquish his zeal. In fact he received inspiration from  it and kept three presses rolling at full speed to turn out tracts,  sermons, and commentaries.    In addition to the Leipzig debate, the summer of 1519 brought forth  another event which was significant in Luther's life. Maximilian, the  Holy Roman Emperor, died in January and the election of a successor was  of utmost concern to the rulers and populace of Europe. Consequently,  there was rejoicing in Germany on June 28 when the electors named  Charles of Spain in preference to Francis of France. Charles was a  Hapsburg and the Germans confidently expected he would unite them into a  strong, independent nation. However, the new emperor favored his Spanish  mother more than his German father and treated his fatherland like an  outlying province of Spain.    Wide distribution of the Ninety-five Theses and other writings, as well  as prominence resulting from the Leipzig encounter, had fixed the eyes  of many Germans upon Luther. When Charles failed to step into the role  of national figure they switched their enthusiasm to Luther. Few  understood his ideas on Christianity but they believed he could lead  them to political, intellectual, and economic freedom. Scholars,  princes, knights, and commoners gathered about the Wittenberg professor  who had demonstrated his fearlessness in the face of tyranny. Gradually  Luther sensed his mission as leader in a mighty movement. History called  it the Reformation.                                  LUTHER EXPLAINS HIMSELF                               The Christian Nobility    Luther's attempts to interest the pope in reform had proved futile. He  was likewise unsuccessful in having a general council convened to  consider his propositions. Now, in the first of three great treatises,  he called upon the secular rulers to concern themselves with the state  of the church.    Appearing in August, 1520, the \"Open Letter to the Christian Nobility of  the German Nation\" flatly attacked corruption among the clergy and  prodded the laity into doing something about it. Since all Christians  are priests before God, Luther held it was incumbent upon them and  particularly upon Christian rulers to feel responsible for the conduct  of the church within their domains. As Christians they should abhor vice  and wickedness regardless of whether it flourished on the main street or  in the monastery.    No one, said the open letter, has been able to reform the Romanists  because they have erected three walls of defense, \"_First_, when pressed  by the temporal power, they have made decrees and said that the temporal  power has no jurisdiction over them. _Second_, when the attempt is made  to reprove them out of the Scriptures, they raise the objection that the  interpretation of the Scriptures belongs to no one except the pope.  _Third_, if threatened with a council, they answer with the fable that  no one can call a council but the pope.\"        [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]    Luther demolished the first wall by showing that everyone is equal  before God. Those holding the title of priest or bishop are not superior  to other Christians nor do they differ except in vocation, by which also  a cobbler differs from a blacksmith. The title of \"priest\" is conferred  by laymen who themselves are priests in the sight of God. Thus the  holder of a church title is not beyond the reach of temporal government.    He breached the second wall by pointing out that every enlightened  Christian--layman or priest--has the right to seek God's message for him  in the Scriptures. The third wall tumbled through Luther's insistence  that every man, as a priest, shares responsibility for right management  in the church.                              The Babylonian Captivity    Before his letter to the nobility was off press, Luther was writing his  second treatise, \"The Babylonian Captivity of the Church.\" The first had  been primarily for lay people while the second was for theologians. It  aimed directly at freeing the Christian fellowship in Europe from the  \"captivity\" of the Roman sacramental system.    The Roman Church taught that it alone could dispense the saving grace  associated with the sacraments, and that the sacramental acts could be  performed only by ordained priests. Anyone who denied that the church  controlled the flow of grace from God was striking Catholicism in its  most vital spot. Without its sacramental system Rome could no longer  bind its subjects. This was the front at which Luther aimed his heaviest  artillery.    He reiterated his views on the priesthood of believers. Priests"]]]
