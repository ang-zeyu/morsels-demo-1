[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4748"],[0,"Baree, Son of Kazan (#3)"],[1," edge of the thick forest.    The fact that Oohoomisew, the big snow owl, had made her nest in a  broken stub not far from the windfall was destined to change the whole  course of Baree's life, just as the blinding of Gray Wolf had changed  hers, and a man's club had changed Kazan's. The creek ran close past  the stub, which had been shriven by lightning; and this stub stood in a  still, dark place in the forest, surrounded by tall, black spruce and  enveloped in gloom even in broad day. Many times Baree had gone to the  edge of this mysterious part of the forest and had peered in curiously,  and with a growing desire.    On this day of his great battle its lure was overpowering. Little by  little he entered into it, his eyes shining brightly and his ears alert  for the slightest sounds that might come out of it. His heart beat  faster. The gloom enveloped him more. He forgot the windfall and Kazan  and Gray Wolf. Here before him lay the thrill of adventure. He heard  strange sounds, but very soft sounds, as if made by padded feet and  downy wings, and they filled him with a thrilling expectancy. Under his  feet there were no grass or weeds or flowers, but a wonderful brown  carpet of soft evergreen needles. They felt good to his feet, and were  so velvety that he could not hear his own movement.    He was fully three hundred yards from the windfall when he passed  Oohoomisew's stub and into a thick growth of young balsams. And  there--directly in his path--crouched the monster!    Papayuchisew [Young Owl] was not more than a third as large as Baree.  But he was a terrifying-looking object. To Baree he seemed all head and  eyes. He could see no body at all. Kazan had never brought in anything  like this, and for a full half-minute he remained very quiet, eying it  speculatively. Papayuchisew did not move a feather. But as Baree  advanced, a cautious step at a time, the bird's eyes grew bigger and  the feathers about his head ruffled up as if stirred by a puff of wind.  He came of a fighting family, this little Papayuchisew--a savage,  fearless, and killing family--and even Kazan would have taken note of  those ruffling feathers.    With a space of two feet between them, the pup and the owlet eyed each  other. In that moment, if Gray Wolf could have been there, she might  have said to Baree: \"Use your legs--and run!\" And Oohoomisew, the old  owl, might have said to Papayuchisew: \"You little fool--use your wings  and fly!\"    They did neither--and the fight began.    Papayuchisew started it, and with a single wild yelp Baree went back in  a heap, the owlet's beak fastened like a red-hot vise in the soft flesh  at the end of his nose. That one yelp of surprise and pain was Baree's  first and last cry in the fight. The wolf surged in him; rage and the  desire to kill possessed him. As Papayuchisew hung on, he made a  curious hissing sound; and as Baree rolled and gnashed his teeth and  fought to free himself from that amazing grip on his nose, fierce  little snarls rose out of his throat.    For fully a minute Baree had no use of his jaws. Then, by accident, he  wedged Papayuchisew in a crotch of a low ground shrub, and a bit of his  nose gave way. He might have run then, but instead of that he was back  at the owlet like a flash. Flop went Papayuchisew on his back, and  Baree buried his needlelike teeth in the bird's breast. It was like  trying to bite through a pillow, the feathers fangs, and just as they  were beginning to prick the owlet's skin, Papayuchisew--jabbing a  little blindly with a beak that snapped sharply every time it  closed--got him by the ear.    The pain of that hold was excruciating to Baree, and he made a more  desperate effort to get his teeth through his enemy's thick armor of  feathers. In the struggle they rolled under the low balsams to the edge  of the ravine through which ran the creek. Over the steep edge they  plunged, and as they rolled and bumped to the bottom, Baree loosed his  hold. Papayuchisew hung valiantly on, and when they reached the bottom  he still had his grip on Baree's ear.    Baree's nose was bleeding. His ear felt as if it were being pulled from  his head; and in this uncomfortable moment a newly awakened instinct  made Baby Papayuchisew discover his wings as a fighting asset. An owl  has never really begun to fight until he uses his wings, and with a  joyous hissing, Papayuchisew began beating his antagonist so fast and  so viciously that Baree was dazed. He was compelled to close his eyes,  and he snapped blindly. For the first time since the battle began he  felt a strong inclination to get away. He tried to tear himself free  with his forepaws, but Papayuchisew--slow to reason but of firm  conviction--hung to Baree's ear like grim fate.    At this critical point, when the understanding of defeat was forming  itself swiftly in Baree's mind, chance saved him. His fangs closed on  one of the owlet's tender feet. Papayuchisew gave a sudden squeak. The  ear was free at last--and with a snarl of triumph Baree gave a vicious  tug at Papayuchisew's leg.    In the excitement of battle he had not heard the rushing tumult of the  creek close under them, and over the edge of a rock Papayuchisew and he  went together, the chill water of the rain-swollen stream muffling a  final snarl and a final hiss of the two little fighters.        CHAPTER 3    To Papayuchisew, after his first mouthful of water, the stream was  almost as safe as the air, for he went sailing down it with the  lightness of a gull, wondering in his slow-thinking big head why he was  moving so swiftly and so pleasantly without any effort of his own.    To Baree it was a different matter. He went down almost like a stone. A  mighty roaring filled his ears; it was dark, suffocating, terrible. In  the swift current he was twisted over and over. For a distance of  twenty feet he was under water. Then he rose to the surface and  desperately began using his legs. It was of little use. He had only  time to blink once or twice and catch a lungful of air when he shot  into a current that was running like a millrace between the butts of  two fallen trees, and for another twenty feet the sharpest eyes could  not have seen hair or hide of him. He came up again at the edge of a  shallow riffle over which the water ran like the rapids at Niagara in  miniature, and for fifty or sixty yards he was flung along like a hairy  ball. From this he was hurled into a deep, cold pool. And then--half  dead--he found himself crawling out on a gravelly bar.    For a long time Baree lay there in a pool of sunlight without moving.  His ear hurt him; his nose was raw, and burned as if he had thrust it  into fire. His legs and body were sore, and as he began to wander along  the gravel bar, he was quite probably the most wretched pup in the  world. He was also completely turned around. In vain he looked about  him for some familiar mark--something that might guide him back to his  windfall home. Everything was strange. He did not know that the water  had flung him out on the wrong side of the stream, and that to reach  the windfall he would have to cross it again. He whined, but that was  as loud as his voice rose. Gray Wolf could have heard his barking, for  the windfall was not more than two hundred and fifty yards up the  stream. But the wolf in Baree held him silent, except for his low  whining.    Striking the main shore, Baree began going downstream. This was away  from the windfall, and each step that he took carried him farther and  farther from home. Every little while he stopped and listened. The  forest was deeper. It was growing blacker and more mysterious. Its  silence was frightening. At the end of half an hour Baree would even  have welcomed Papayuchisew. And he would not have fought him--he would  have inquired, if possible, the way back home.    Baree was fully three-quarters of a mile from the windfall when he came  to a point where the creek split itself into two channels. He had but  one choice to follow--the stream that flowed a little south and east.  This stream did not run swiftly. It was not filled with shimmering  riffles, and rocks about which the water sang and foamed. It grew  black, like the forest. It was still and deep. Without knowing it,  Baree was burying himself deeper and deeper into Tusoo's old trapping  grounds. Since Tusoo had died, they had lain undisturbed except for the  wolves, for Gray Wolf and Kazan had not hunted on this side of the  waterway--and the wolves themselves preferred the more open country for  the chase.    Suddenly Baree found himself at the edge of a deep, dark pool in which  the water lay still as oil, and his heart nearly jumped out of his body  when a great, sleek, shining creature sprang out from almost under his  nose and landed with a tremendous splash in the center of it. It was  Nekik, the otter.    The otter had not heard Baree, and in another moment Napanekik, his  wife, came sailing out of a patch of gloom, and behind her came three  little otters, leaving behind them four shimmering wakes in the  oily-looking water. What happened after that made Baree forget for a  few minutes that he was lost. Nekik had disappeared under the surface,  and now he came up directly under his unsuspecting mate with a force  that lifted her half out of the water. Instantly he was gone again, and  Napanekik took after him fiercely. To Baree it did not look like play.  Two of the baby otters had pitched on the third, which seemed to be  fighting desperately. The chill and ache went out of Baree's body. His  blood ran excitedly. He forgot himself, and let out a bark. In a flash  the otters disappeared. For several minutes the water in the pool  continued to rock and heave--and that was all. After a little, Baree  drew himself back into the bushes and went on.    It was about three o'clock in the afternoon, and the sun should still  have been well up in the sky. But it was growing darker"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47519"],[0,"President Heber C. Kimball's Journal (#3)"],[1,"the Almighty.    The last Sunday we were on the water I went to the captain and asked  the privilege for one of us to preach on board. He very obligingly  agreed, and appointed the time when it would be most suitable for  himself and the crew to attend, which was at one o'clock p. m. We then  appointed Brother Hyde to speak, and notified the crew and passengers  of the circumstance.    At the time appointed, there was a congregation of from two to three  hundred persons assembled on the deck, who listened with great  attention and deep interest to the discourse, which was delivered  with great power. I think I never heard Brother Hyde speak with  such power and eloquence as that time; he spoke on the subject of  the resurrection. The time being limited on account of the duties  of the ship's company, his subject was necessarily condensed. The  congregation was composed of persons from different nations, and of  different faiths, English, Irish, Scotch, Germans, French, etc., both  Jews and Christians. A great feeling was produced upon the minds of  the assembly, who had never heard the subject treated in like manner  before, and from the conversation we afterwards had with several of  them, I believe that good was done and many from that time began to  search the scriptures for themselves, which are able to make men wise  unto salvation.    On the 15th of July we came in sight of land, which caused joy and  gratitude to my Heavenly Father to arise in my bosom for the favorable  passage we had had so far and the prospect of soon reaching our  destination. We then sailed up the Irish channel, having Ireland on  our left and Wales on our right. The scenery was very beautiful and  imposing.    Three days after first seeing land, being the 18th of July, we arrived  in Liverpool, one of the largest ports in Great Britain, being just  seventeen days and two hours from our departure from New York. The  packet ship _South America_, which left New York the same time we did,  came in a few lengths behind. The sight was very grand to see these two  vessels enter port, with every inch of canvass spread. When we first  got sight of Liverpool, I went to the side of the vessel and poured out  my soul in praise and thanksgiving to God for the prosperous voyage  and for all the mercies which He had vouchsafed to me, and while thus  engaged, and while contemplating the scenery which then presented  itself and the circumstances which had brought me thus far, the Spirit  of the Lord rested upon me in a powerful manner; my soul was filled  with love and gratitude, and was humbled within me, while I covenanted  to dedicate myself to God and to love and serve Him with all my heart.    Immediately after we anchored, a small boat came alongside, and  several of the passengers, with Brothers Hyde, Richards, Goodson and  myself got in and went on shore. When we were within six or seven feet  from the pier, I leaped on shore, and for the first time in my life  stood on British ground, among strangers whose manners and customs  were different from my own. My feelings at that time were peculiar,  particularly when I realized the object, importance and extent of my  mission and the work to which I had been appointed and in which I was  shortly to be engaged.        CHAPTER II.    TIMIDITY AT THE THOUGHTS OF MY TASK--PROMPTED BY THE SPIRIT TO GO TO  PRESTON--THE \"TRUTH WILL PREVAIL\"--MEET ELDER FIELDING'S BROTHER, A  PREACHER--INVITED TO PREACH IN HIS CHAPEL--SEEING HIS CRAFT ENDANGERED,  HE CLOSES HIS DOORS AGAINST US--ANOTHER MINISTER FORBIDS US BAPTIZING  HIS CHURCH MEMBERS--DESPERATE STRUGGLE WITH EVIL SPIRITS--COMMENCE  BAPTIZING--ELDERS SEPARATE--OPPOSED BY A MINISTER--HIS SUBSEQUENT SHAME.    The idea of standing forth and proclaiming the gospel in a land so much  extolled for religion, which was constantly sending forth her ministers  to almost every nation under heaven, and among a people who, of course,  did not expect to be taught, but to teach others the principles of the  gospel, and the consciousness of my own weakness and unfitness for  such an undertaking, led me to cry mightily to the Lord for wisdom and  for that comfort and support which I so much needed. At the same time  I thought that if I could have been relieved from the responsibility  which rested upon me, by fighting Goliath on as unequal terms as David  did, I should have felt myself happy.    However, I endeavored to put my trust in God, believing that He would  assist me in publishing the truth and that He would be a present help  in the time of need.    Having no means, poor and penniless we wandered in the streets of that  great city, where wealth and luxury, penury and want abound. I there  met the rich attired in the most costly dresses, and the next moment  was saluted with the cries of the poor, who were without covering  sufficient to screen them from the weather. Such a distinction I never  saw before. We then looked out for a place to lodge in, and found a  room belonging to a widow which we engaged for a few days.    The time we were in Liverpool was spent in council and in calling on  the Lord for direction, so that we might be led to places where we  should be most useful in proclaiming the gospel and in establishing and  spreading His kingdom. While thus engaged, the Spirit of the Lord, the  mighty power of God, was with us, and we felt greatly strengthened, and  a determination to go forward, come life or death, honor or reproach,  was manifested by us all. Our trust was in God, who we believed could  make us as useful in bringing down the kingdom of Satan as He did the  rams' horns, in bringing down the walls of Jericho and in gathering  out a number of precious souls who were buried amidst the rubbish of  tradition, and who had none to show them the way of truth.    Feeling led by the Spirit of the Lord to go to Preston, a large  manufacturing town in Lancashire, we started for that place three  days after our arrival in Liverpool. We went by coach and arrived on  Saturday afternoon about four o'clock. After unloading our trunks,  Brother Goodson went in search of a place of lodging, and Brother  Fielding went to seek a brother of his, who was a minister, residing in  that place.    It being the day on which their representatives were chosen, the  streets presented a very busy scene; indeed I never witnessed anything  like it before in my life.    On one of the flags, which was just enrolled before us the moment  the coach reached its destination, was the following motto: \"TRUTH  WILL PREVAIL,\" which was painted in large, gilt letters. It being so  very seasonable and the sentiment being so appropriate to us in our  situation, we were involuntarily led to exclaim, \"Amen! So let it be.\"    Brother Goodson having found a room where we could be accommodated,  which belonged to a widow woman, situated in Wilford Street, we moved  our baggage there. Shortly after, Brother. Fielding returned, having  found his brother, who requested to have an interview with some of us  that evening. Accordingly, Elders Hyde, Goodson and I went and were  kindly received by him and Mr. Watson, his brother-in-law, who was  present at the time.    We gave them a short account of the object of our mission and the great  work which the Lord had commenced, and conversed upon those subjects  until a late hour. The next morning we were presented with half a  crown, which Mr. Fielding's sister had sent us.    It being Sunday, we went to hear Mr. Fielding preach. After he had  finished his discourse, and without being requested by us, he gave out  an appointment for some one of us to preach in the afternoon.    It being noised abroad that some Elders from America were in town  and were going to preach in the afternoon, a large concourse of  people assembled to hear us. It falling to my lot to speak, I called  their attention to the first principles of the gospel, and told them  something of the nature of the work which the Lord had commenced on  the earth. Brother Hyde afterwards bore testimony to the same, which I  believe was received by many with whom I afterwards conversed.    Another appointment was given out for us in the evening, at which  time Brother Goodson preached and Brother Fielding bore testimony.  An appointment was then made for us on Wednesday evening at the same  place, at which time Elder Hyde preached. A number now being convinced  of the truth, believed the testimony and began to praise God and  rejoice exceedingly that the Lord had again visited His people, and  sent His servants to lay before them the doctrine of the gospel \"and  the truth as it is in Jesus.\"    The Rev. Mr. Fielding, who had kindly invited us to preach in his  chapel, knowing that quite a number of his members believed our  testimony and that some were wishful to be baptized, shut his doors  against us and would suffer us to preach no more in his chapel. For an  excuse, he said that we had preached the doctrine of baptism for the  remission of sins, contrary to our arrangement with him.    I need scarcely assure my friends that nothing was said to him from  which any inference could be drawn that we should suppress the doctrine  of baptism. No! We deemed it too important a doctrine to lay aside for  any privilege we could receive from mortals. Mr. Fielding understood  our doctrines even before we came there, having received several  communications from his brother Joseph, who wrote to him from Canada,  explaining the doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints. We likewise had conversed with him on the subject at our former  interview. However, he having been traditioned to believe in infant  baptism, and having preached and practiced the same a number of years,  he saw the situation he would be placed in if he obeyed the gospel.  Notwithstanding his talents and standing in society, he would have to  come into the sheepfold by the door; and after all his preaching"]]]
