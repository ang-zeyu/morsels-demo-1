Man is not pure Self, pure consciousness, Samvid. That is an  abstraction. In the concrete universe there are always the Self  and His sheaths, however tenuous the latter may be, so that a  unit of consciousness is inseparable from matter, and a Jivatma,  or Monad, is invariably consciousness plus matter.    In order that this may come out clearly, two terms are used in  Yoga as constituting man√ÑPrana and Pradhana, life-breath and  matter. Prana is not only the life-breath of the body, but the  totality of the life forces of the universe or, in other words,  the life-side of the universe.    \"I am Prana,\" says Indra. Prana here means the totality of the  life-forces. They are taken as consciousness, mind. Pradhana is  the term used for matter. Body, or the opposite of mind, means  for the yogi in practice so much of the appropriated matter of  the outer world as he is able to put away from himself, to  distinguish from his own consciousness.    This division is very significant and useful, if you can catch  clearly hold of the root idea. Of course, looking at the thing  from beginning to end, you will see Prana, the great Life, the  great Self, always present in all, and you will see the  envelopes, the bodies, the sheaths, present at the different  stages, taking different forms; but from the standpoint of yogic  practice, that is called Prana, or Self, with which the man  identifies himself for the time, including every sheath of matter  from which the man is unable to separate himself in  consciousness. That unit, to the yogi, is the Self, so that it is  a changing quantity. As he drops off one sheath after another and  says: \" That is not myself,\" he is coming nearer and nearer to  his highest point, to consciousness in a single film, in a single  atom of matter, a Monad. For all practical purposes of Yoga, the  man, the working, conscious man, is so much of him as he cannot  separate from the matter enclosing him, or with which he is  connected. Only that is body which the man is able to put aside  and say: \"This is not I, but mine.\" We find we have a whole  series of terms in Yoga which may be repeated over and over  again. All the states of mind exist on every plane, says Vyasa,  and this way of dealing with man enables the same significant  words, as we shall see in a moment, to be used over and over  again, with an ever subtler connotation; they all become  relative, and are equally true at each stage of evolution.    Now it is quite clear that, so far as many of us are concerned,  the physical body is the only thing of which we can say: \" It is  not myself \"; so that, in the practice of Yoga at first, for you,  all the words that would be used in it to describe the states of  consciousness, the states of mind, would deal with the waking  consciousness in the body as the lowest state, and, rising up  from that, all the words would be relative terms, implying a  distinct and recognisable state of the mind in relation to that  which is the lowest. In order to know how you shall begin to  apply to yourselves the various terms used to describe the states  of mind, you must carefully analyse your own consciousness, and  find out how much of it is really consciousness, and how much is  matter so closely appropriated that you cannot separate it from  yourself.          States of Mind        Let us take it in detail. Four states of consciousness are spoken  of amongst us. \"Waking\" consciousness or Jagrat; the \"dream\"  consciousness, or Svapna; the \"deep sleep\" consciousness, or  Sushupti; and the state beyond that, called Turiya[FN#3: It is  impossible to avoid the use of these technical terms, even in an  introduction to Yoga. There are no exact English equivalents, and  they are no more troublesome to learn than any other technical  psychological terms.] How are those related to the body?    Jagrat is the ordinary waking consciousness, that you and I are  using at the present time. If our consciousness works in the  subtle, or astral, body, and is able to impress its experiences  upon the brain, it is called Svapna, or in English, dream  consciousness; it is more vivid and real than the Jagrat state.  When working in the subtler form--the mental body--it is not able  to impress its experiences on the brain, it is called Sushupti or  deep sleep consciousness; then the mind is working on its own  contents, not on outer objects. But if it has so far separated  itself from connection with the brain, that it cannot be readily  recalled by outer means, then it is, called Turiya, a lofty state  of trance. These four states, when correlated to the four planes,  represent a much unfolded consciousness. Jagrat is related to the  physical; Svapna to the astral; Sushupti to the mental; and  Turiya to the buddhic. When passing from one world to another, we  should use these words to designate the consciousness working  under the conditions of each world. But the same words are  repeated in the books of Yoga with a different context. There the  difficulty occurs, if we have not learned their relative nature.  Svapna is not the same for all, nor is Sushupti the same for  everyone.    Above all, the word samadhi, to be explained in a moment, is used  in different ways and in different senses. How then are we to  find our way in this apparent tangle? By knowing the state which  is the starting-point, and then the sequence will always be the  same. All of you are familiar with the waking consciousness in  the physical body. You can find four states even in that, if you  analyse it, and a similar sequence of the states of the mind is  found on every plane.    How to distinguish them, then ? Let us take the waking  consciousness, and try to see the four states in that. Suppose I  take up a book and read it. I read the words; my eyes arc related  to the outer physical consciousness. That is the Jagrat state. I  go behind the words to the meaning of the words. I have passed  from the waking state of the physical plane into the Svapna state  of waking consciousness, that sees through the outer form,  seeking the inner life. I pass from this to the mind of the  writer; here the mind touches the mind; it is the waking  consciousness in its Sushupti state. If I pass from this contact  and enter the very mind of the writer, and live in that man's  mind, then I have reached the Turiya state of the waking  consciousness.    Take another illustration. I look at any watch; I am in Jagrat. I  close my eyes and make an image of the watch; I am in Svapna. I  call together many ideas of many watches, and reach the ideal  watch; I am in Sushupti. I pass to the ideal of time in the  abstract; I am in Turiya. But all these are stages in the  physical plane consciousness; I have not left the body.    In this way, you can make states of mind intelligible and real,  instead of mere words.          Samadhi        Some other important words, which recur from time to time in the  Yoga-sutras, need to be understood, though there are no exact  English equivalents. As they must be used to avoid clumsy  circumlocutions, it is necessary to explain them. It is said:  \"Yoga is Samadhi.\" Samadhi is a state in which the consciousness  is so dissociated from the body that the latter remains  insensible. It is a state of trance in which the mind is fully  self-conscious, though the body is insensitive, and from which  the mind returns to the body with the experiences it has had in  the superphysical state, remembering them when again immersed in  the physical brain. Samadhi for any one person is relative to his  waking consciousness, but implies insensitiveness of the body. If  an ordinary person throws himself into trance and is active on  the astral plane, his Samadhi is on the astral. If his  consciousness is functioning in the mental plane, Samadhi is  there. The man who can so withdraw from the body as to leave it  insensitive, while his mind is fully self-conscious, can practice  Samadhi.    The phrase \"Yoga is Samadhi\" covers facts of the highest  significance and greatest instruction. Suppose you are only able  to reach the astral world when you are asleep, your consciousness  there is, as we have seen, in the Svapna state. But as you slowly  unfold your powers, the astral forms begin to intrude upon your  waking physical consciousness until they appear as distinctly as  do physical forms, and thus become objects of your waking  consciousness. The astral world then, for you, no longer belongs  to the Svapna consciousness, but to the Jagrat; you have taken  two worlds within the scope of your Jagrat consciousness--the  physical and the astral worlds--and the mental world is in your  Svapna consciousness. \"Your body\" is then the physical and the  astral bodies taken together. As you go on, the mental plane  begins similarly to intrude itself, and the physical, astral and  mental all come within your waking consciousness; all these are,  then, your Jagrat world. These three worlds form but one world to  you; their three corresponding bodies but one body, that  perceives and acts. The three bodies of the ordinary man have  become one body for the yogi. If under these conditions you want  to see only one world at a time, you must fix your attention on  it, and thus focus it. You can, in that state of enlarged waking,  concentrate your attention on the physical and see it; then the  astral and mental will appear hazy. So you can focus your  attention on the astral and see it; then the physical and the  mental, being out of focus, will appear dim. You will easily  understand this if you remember that, in this hall, I may focus  my sight in the middle of the hall, when the pillars on both  sides will appear indistinctly. Or I may concentrate my attention  on a pillar and see it distinctly, but I then see you only  vaguely at the same time. It is a change of focus, not a change  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4290"],[0,"The Dominion in 1983 (#3)"],[1,"was over. Of course the benefit to Canada of having  had the national feeling so deeply stirred was incalculable, for  all classes of men in all the provinces had been animated by the  profoundest sentiments and the strongest determination possible,  and it was the opinion of leading military men of the time that the  Canadians under arms, though outnumbered trebly by the intending  invaders, would have held their own gallantly and have come off  victorious.    The excitement aroused by these stirring occurrences began to quiet  down towards the approaching Fall, when the Canadian ship of state  was again under full sail, heading for the waters of prosperity.  Since then our political history has been so intimately connected  with great inventions and discoveries, that a narration of one  without a description of the other is scarcely possible.        II.        \"For miracles are ceased;    \"And therefore we must needs admit the means    \"How things are perfected.\"                        --Henry V, Act I.      It was well understood by the Romans in their palmy days that a  great empire could not be held together without means of easy  communication between distant provinces, and their fine hard roads  ramifying from Rome to the remote corners of Gaul or Dacia, testify  to their wisdom and enterprise in this respect. When Great Britain  in the eighteenth century, full of inventive skill, reared men who  by means of improved roads, well-bred horses and fine vehicles  raised the rate of travel to ten miles an hour from end to end of  the kingdom, a great deal of complacent satisfaction was indulged  in over the advantages likely to result from such rapid travelling.  This great speed, however, was made to appear quite slow in the  first half of the nineteenth century when locomotives were invented  capable of covering sixty miles an hour. Nowadays the old cumbrous  locomotive, rumbling and puffing along and making only sixty miles  in sixty minutes, is a very dilatory machine in comparison with  our light and beautiful rocket cars, which frequently dart through  the air at the rate of sixty miles in one minute. The advantages  to a country like ours, over 3,000 miles wide, of swift transit  are obvious. The differences in sentiment, politically, nationally,  and morally, which arose aforetime when people under the same  government lived 3,000 miles apart have disappeared to be replaced  by a powerful unanimity that renders possible great social  movements, utterly impossible in the railway age, when seven days  were consumed in journeying from east to west. The old idea that  balloons would be used in this century for travelling has proved  a delusion, almost their only use now being a meteorological one.    Our rocket cars were only perfected in the usual slow course of  invention, and could neither have been constructed nor propelled  a hundred years ago, for neither was the metal of which they are  constructed produced, nor had the method of propulsion or even the  propulsive power been developed. Inventors had to wait till science  had given us in abundance a metal less than a quarter the weight of  iron, but as strong and durable, and this was not until some fifty  years ago when a process was discovered for producing cheaply the  beautiful metal calcium. But calcium would have been little use  alone. Aluminium, which is now so plentiful, had to be alloyed  with it, and aluminium was not used to any great extent till the  beginning of this century, when an electric process of reducing it  quickly from its ore--common clay--was discovered. The metal known  as calcium bronze, which is now so common, is an alloy of calcium,  0.75; aluminium, 0.20; and 0.05 of other metals and metalloids in  varying proportions according to different patents. This alloy has  all the useful properties of the finest steel with about one-fourth  its weight, and is besides perfectly non-oxydisable and never  tarnishes. Without the production of a metal with all these  combined qualities, we might still in our journeys, be dawdling  along at sixty miles an hour in a cumbrous railroad car behind  a snorting, screaming locomotive.    Our swiftly darting cars were not at first constructed on such  perfect principles as now. Invention seems to follow certain laws,  and has to take its time. A new discovery in physics has to be  supplemented by one in chemistry, and one in chemistry by another  in physics, and so on through a whole century, perhaps, before any  great invention is perfected. Thus it happens that, though the  principle of the rocket has been known for an age, it is only  comparatively recently that it has been applied to the propulsion  of cars. An invention, too, always presents itself to an inventor  at first in the most complicated form, and frequently many years  are passed in attempts at simplification. What a wide interval is  there between the steam locomotive with all its complex mechanism,  and the magnificently simple rocket car! A century of ceaseless  invention is comprehended between the two! Before the simplicity  of our cars was arrived at, inventors had to give up boilers,  fire-boxes, valves, steam-pipes, cylinders, pistons, wheels,  cranks, levers, and a host of minor parts. Wheels died hard.  Electric locomotives using them were brought out and were  considered to do the very fastest thing possible in locomotion,  and such was in fact the case while wheels were used, for wheels  could not have borne a faster pace without flying to pieces from  centrifugal force. But when an inventor devised a machine on  runners to move on lubricated rails, a great step was gained,  though the invention was not a success, and when, after this,  liquid carbonic acid, or carbonic acid ice expanding again to a gas  was employed as a motive power, another advance was made. Then the  greatest lift of all was given. The solidification of oxygen and  hydrogen by an easy process was discovered and mankind presented  with a new motive power. In due time a way was found to make the  solid substance re-assume the gaseous form either suddenly or by  degrees, and thenceforth thousands of potential horse-power could  be obtained in a form convenient for storing or carrying about.  It is now as simple a matter to buy a hundred horse-power over  the counter as a pound of sugar.    From Toronto to Winnipeg in thirty minutes! From Winnipeg to the  Pacific in forty minutes! Such is our usual pace in 1983. By hiring  a special car the whole distance from Toronto to Victoria can  be accomplished in fifty minutes. A higher speed still is quite  possible, but is not permitted because of the risk of collision  with other cars. Collisions have never yet occurred on account of  the rigid adherence to very strict regulations. Cars that take  short trips of 50 to 100 miles between stations, seldom travel more  than 500 feet from the earth, but for long distances about 1,500  feet is usual. The broad metal slides for receiving the cars and  for their departure, which extend for a mile on each side of all  our stations, are the only portions of the rocket system which much  resemble anything connected with railroads. It is said that great  skill and long practice on the conductor's part are required to  cause the cars to alight well on the slides and draw up at the  stations. The slides at many stations are nearly level with the  ground, but ascend in opposite directions, till at the distance of  a mile, where they end, they are 100 feet high. The cars are now  made quite cylindrical, tapering off abruptly at the closed end.  The outside is entirely of metal, very highly polished, and showing  no projections except a flange on each side, two broad runners  underneath, and a 40 foot rear flange or vane. The dimensions are  usually--diameter of cylinder, 20 feet; length, 45 feet. The high  polish is necessary to avoid heating when the highest speed is  attained. Passengers are seated in a luxurious chamber in the  interior of the cylinder, which is suspended like the compass of a  vessel, and therefore always retains an upright position whatever  may be the position of the car when travelling. About fifty  passengers can be accommodated at one time. The tube emerging  a little beyond the mouth of the cylinder, through which the  expanding gases are expelled, can be slightly deviated from its  axial position in any direction, and thus what little steering  is required is easily effected. The long projecting 40 foot vane  or tail which steadies the motion of the whole machine is, in  the newest patents, made to assist it in alighting on the slides  easily and without jarring. Such is the splendid apparatus,  briefly described, which brings all the ends of the earth together  and makes the whole world a public park, the most distant parts of  which can be visited and returned from in the course of a day. Long  tedious voyages of a week or a month belong to the forgotten past,  for Paris, Calcutta or Hong Kong can be reached in a fraction of  the time formerly occupied in going from Toronto to Montreal. No  passenger traffic is ever carried on now in dangerous vessels upon  the treacherous ocean, but solely in the safe and comfortable  rocket-car through the air a thousand feet or more above the cruel  waters. Steamships, electric ships and sailing vessels are still  common round our coasts engaged in transporting heavy freight, but  they only cross the ocean to convey some bulky produce which cannot  be divided and go by car.    Private vehicles and travelling have also undergone wonderful  changes. The much-abused horse has vanished from cities entirely,  and is not permitted to enter them, greatly to the preservation  of health and cleanliness. All our vehicles have the automatic  electric attachment and move along briskly through the clean wide  streets. The handsome electric tricycles we are so familiar with,  were hardly thought of a hundred"]]]
