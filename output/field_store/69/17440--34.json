[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6852"],[0,"Venus in Furs (#3)"],[1," don't believe that the old Venetian had any secondary intention. He  simply painted the portrait of some aristocratic Mesalina, and was  tactful enough to let Cupid hold the mirror in which she tests her  majestic allure with cold satisfaction. He looks as though his task  were becoming burdensome enough. The picture is painted flattery.  Later an 'expert' in the Rococo period baptized the lady with the  name of Venus. The furs of the despot in which Titian's fair model  wrapped herself, probably more for fear of a cold than out of  modesty, have become a symbol of the tyranny and cruelty that  constitute woman's essence and her beauty.    \"But enough of that. The picture, as it now exists, is a bitter  satire on our love. Venus in this abstract North, in this icy  Christian world, has to creep into huge black furs so as not to catch  cold--\"    Severin laughed, and lighted a fresh cigarette.    Just then the door opened and an attractive, stoutish, blonde girl  entered. She had wise, kindly eyes, was dressed in black silk, and  brought us cold meat and eggs with our tea. Severin took one of the  latter, and decapitated it with his knife.    \"Didn't I tell you that I want them soft-boiled?\" he cried with a  violence that made the young woman tremble.    \"But my dear Sevtchu--\" she said timidly.    \"Sevtchu, nothing,\" he yelled, \"you are to obey, obey, do you  understand?\" and he tore the _kantchuk_ [Footnote: A long whip with a  short handle.] which was hanging beside the weapons from its hook.    The woman fled from the chamber quickly and timidly like a doe.    \"Just wait, I'll get you yet,\" he called after her.    \"But Severin,\" I said placing my hand on his arm, \"how can you treat  a pretty young woman thus?\"    \"Look at the woman,\" he replied, blinking humorously with his eyes.  \"Had I flattered her, she would have cast the noose around my neck,  but now, when I bring her up with the _kantchuk_, she adores me.\"    \"Nonsense!\"    \"Nonsense, nothing, that is the way you have to break in women.\"    \"Well, if you like it, live like a pasha in your harem, but don't  lay down theories for me--\"    \"Why not,\" he said animatedly. \"Goethe's 'you must be hammer or anvil'  is absolutely appropriate to the relation between man and woman.  Didn't Lady Venus in your dream prove that to you? Woman's power lies  in man's passion, and she knows how to use it, if man doesn't  understand himself. He has only one choice: to be the _tyrant_ over or  the _slave_ of woman. As soon as he gives in, his neck is under the  yoke, and the lash will soon fall upon him.\"    \"Strange maxims!\"    \"Not maxims, but experiences,\" he replied, nodding his head, \"_I have  actually felt the lash_. I am cured. Do you care to know how?\"    He rose, and got a small manuscript from his massive desk, and put  it in front of me.    \"You have already asked about the picture. I have long owed you an  explanation. Here--read!\"    Severin sat down by the chimney with his back toward me, and seemed  to dream with open eyes. Silence had fallen again, and again the fire  sang in the chimney, and the samovar and the cricket in the old  walls. I opened the manuscript and read:    CONFESSIONS OF A SUPERSENSUAL MAN.    The margin of the manuscript bore as motto a variation of the well-known  lines from _Faust_:       \"Thou supersensual sensual wooer     A woman leads you by the nose.\"     --MEPHISTOPHELES.    I turned the title-page and read: \"What follows has been compiled  from my diary of that period, because it is impossible ever frankly  to write of one's past, but in this way everything retains its fresh  colors, the colors of the present.\"    Gogol, the Russian Moliere, says--where? well, somewhere--\"the real  comic muse is the one under whose laughing mask tears roll down.\"    A wonderful saying.    So I have a very curious feeling as I am writing all this down. The  atmosphere seems filled with a stimulating fragrance of flowers,  which overcomes me and gives me a headache. The smoke of the  fireplace curls and condenses into figures, small gray-bearded  kokolds that mockingly point their finger at me. Chubby-cheeked  cupids ride on the arms of my chair and on my knees. I have to smile  involuntarily, even laugh aloud, as I am writing down my adventures.  Yet I am not writing with ordinary ink, but with red blood that drips  from my heart. All its wounds long scarred over have opened and it  throbs and hurts, and now and then a tear falls on the paper.    The days creep along sluggishly in the little Carpathian health-resort.  You see no one, and no one sees you. It is boring enough to write idyls.  I would have leisure here to supply a whole gallery of paintings,  furnish a theater with new pieces for an entire season, a dozen  virtuosos with concertos, trios, and duos, but--what am I saying--the  upshot of it all is that I don't do much more than to stretch the  canvas, smooth the bow, line the scores. For I am--no false modesty,  Friend Severin; you can lie to others, but you don't quite succeed any  longer in lying to yourself--I am nothing but a dilettante, a dilettante  in painting, in poetry, in music, and several other of the so-called  unprofitable arts, which, however, at present secure for their masters  the income of a cabinet minister, or even that of a minor potentate.  Above all else I am a dilettante in life.    Up to the present I have lived as I have painted and written poetry.  I never got far beyond the preparation, the plan, the first act, the  first stanza. There are people like that who begin everything, and  never finish anything. I am such a one.    But what am I saying?    To the business in hand.    I lie in my window, and the miserable little town, which fills me  with despondency, really seems infinitely full of poetry. How  wonderful the outlook upon the blue wall of high mountains interwoven  with golden sunlight; mountain-torrents weave through them like  ribbons of silver! How clear and blue the heavens into which  snowcapped crags project; how green and fresh the forested slopes;  the meadows on which small herds graze, down to the yellow billows  of grain where reapers stand and bend over and rise up again.    The house in which I live stands in a sort of park, or forest, or  wilderness, whatever one wants to call it, and is very solitary.    Its sole inhabitants are myself, a widow from Lemberg, and Madame  Tartakovska, who runs the house, a little old woman, who grows older  and smaller each day. There are also an old dog that limps on one  leg, and a young cat that continually plays with a ball of yarn. This  ball of yarn, I believe, belongs to the widow.    She is said to be really beautiful, this widow, still very young,  twenty-four at the most, and very rich. She dwells in the first story,  and I on the ground floor. She always keeps the green blinds drawn, and  has a balcony entirely overgrown with green climbing-plants. I for my  part down below have a comfortable, intimate arbor of honeysuckle, in  which I read and write and paint and sing like a bird among the twigs. I  can look up on the balcony. Sometimes I actually do so, and then from  time to time a white gown gleams between the dense green network.    Really the beautiful woman up there doesn't interest me very much, for I  am in love with someone else, and terribly unhappy at that; far more  unhappy than the Knight of Toggenburg or the Chevalier in Manon  l'Escault, because the object of my adoration is of stone.    In the garden, in the tiny wilderness, there is a graceful little  meadow on which a couple of deer graze peacefully. On this meadow is  a stone statue of Venus, the original of which, I believe, is in  Florence. This Venus is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in  all my life.    That, however, does not signify much, for I have seen few beautiful  women, or rather few women at all. In love too, I am a dilettante who  never got beyond the preparation, the first act.    But why talk in superlatives, as if something that is beautiful  could be surpassed?    It is sufficient to say that this Venus is beautiful. I love her  passionately with a morbid intensity; madly as one can only love a  woman who never responds to our love with anything but an eternally  uniform, eternally calm, stony smile. I literally adore her.    I often lie reading under the leafy covering of a young birch when  the sun broods over the forest. Often I visit that cold, cruel  mistress of mine by night and lie on my knees before her, with the  face pressed against the cold pedestal on which her feet rest, and  my prayers go up to her.    The rising moon, which just now is waning, produces an indescribable  effect. It seems to hover among the trees and submerges the meadow  in its gleam of silver. The goddess stands as if transfigured, and  seems to bathe in the soft moonlight.    Once when I was returning from my devotions by one of the walks  leading to the house, I suddenly saw a woman's figure, white as  stone, under the illumination of the moon and separated from me  merely by a screen of trees. It seemed as if the beautiful woman of  marble had taken pity on me, become alive, and followed me. I was  seized by a nameless fear, my heart threatened to burst, and instead--    Well, I am a dilettante. As always, I broke down at the second  stanza; rather, on the contrary, I did not break down, but ran away  as fast as my legs would carry me.           *       *       *       *       *    What an accident! Through a Jew, dealing in photographs I secured a  picture of my ideal. It is a small reproduction of Titian's \"Venus  with the Mirror.\" What a woman! I want to write a poem, but instead,  I take the reproduction, and write on it: _Venus in Furs_.    You are cold, while you yourself fan flames. By all means wrap  yourself in your despotic furs, there is no one to whom they are more  appropriate, cruel goddess of love and of beauty!--After a while I add  a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6877"],[0,"The Head of Kay's (#3)"],[1,"  voice.    The idea caught on. It was just what was wanted to give a finish to  the evening's festivities. Fenn had done well by the house. He had  scored four centuries and an eighty, and was going to knock off the  runs against Blackburn's tomorrow off his own bat. Also, he had taken  eighteen wickets in the final house-match. Obviously Fenn was a person  deserving of all encouragement. It would be a pity to let him think  that his effort had passed unnoticed by the fags' room. Happy thought!  Three cheers and one more, and then \"He's a jolly good fellow\", to  wind up with.    It was while those familiar words, \"It's a way we have in the public  scho-o-o-o-l-s\", were echoing through the room in various keys, that a  small and energetic form brushed past Fenn as he stood in the doorway,  vainly trying to stop the fags' choral efforts.    It was Mr Kay.    The singing ceased gradually, very gradually. It was some time before  Mr Kay could make himself heard. But after a couple of minutes there  was a lull, and the house-master's address began to be audible.    \"... unendurable noise. What is the meaning of it? I will not have it.  Do you hear? It is disgraceful. Every boy in this room will write me  two hundred lines by tomorrow evening. It is abominable, Fenn.\" He  wheeled round towards the head of the house. \"Fenn, I am surprised at  you standing here and allowing such a disgraceful disturbance to go  on. Really, if you cannot keep order better--It is disgraceful,  disgraceful.\"    Mr Kay shot out of the room. Fenn followed in his wake, and the  procession made its way to the house-masters' study. It had been a  near thing, but the last straw had arrived before the holidays.    Mr Kay wheeled round as he reached his study door.    \"Well, Fenn?\"    Fenn said nothing.    \"Have you anything you wish to say, Fenn?\"    \"I thought you might have something to say to me, sir.\"    \"I do not understand you, Fenn.\"    \"I thought you might wish to apologise for slanging me in front of the  fags.\"    It is wonderful what a difference the last straw will make in one's  demeanour to a person.    \"Apologise! I think you forget whom it is you are speaking to.\"    When a master makes this well-worn remark, the wise youth realises  that the time has come to close the conversation. All Fenn's prudence,  however, had gone to the four winds.    \"If you wanted to tell me I was not fit to be head of the house, you  needn't have done it before a roomful of fags. How do you think I can  keep order in the house if you do that sort of thing?\"    Mr Kay overcame his impulse to end the interview abruptly in order to  put in a thrust.    \"You do not keep order in the house, Fenn,\" he said, acidly.    \"I do when I am not interfered with.\"    \"You will be good enough to say 'sir' when you speak to me, Fenn,\"  said Mr Kay, thereby scoring another point. In the stress of the  moment, Fenn had not noticed the omission.    He was silenced. And before he could recover himself, Mr Kay was in  his study, and there was a closed, forbidding door between them.    And as he stared at it, it began slowly to dawn upon Fenn that he had  not shown up to advantage in the recent interview. In a word, he had  made a fool of himself.          III    THE FINAL HOUSE-MATCH      Blackburn's took the field at three punctually on the following  afternoon, to play out the last act of the final house-match. They  were not without some small hope of victory, for curious things happen  at cricket, especially in the fourth innings of a match. And runs are  admitted to be easier saved than made. Yet seventy-nine seemed an  absurdly small score to try and dismiss a team for, and in view of the  fact that that team contained a batsman like Fenn, it seemed smaller  still. But Jimmy Silver, resolutely as he had declared victory  impossible to his intimate friends, was not the man to depress his  team by letting it become generally known that he considered  Blackburn's chances small.    \"You must work like niggers in the field,\" he said; \"don't give away a  run. Seventy-nine isn't much to make, but if we get Fenn out for a  few, they won't come near it.\"    He did not add that in his opinion Fenn would take very good care that  he did not get out for a few. It was far more likely that he would  make that seventy-nine off his own bat in a dozen overs.    \"You'd better begin, Kennedy,\" he continued, \"from the top end. Place  your men where you want 'em. I should have an extra man in the deep,  if I were you. That's where Fenn kept putting them last innings. And  you'll want a short leg, only for goodness sake keep them off the  leg-side if you can. It's a safe four to Fenn every time if you don't.  Look out, you chaps. Man in.\"    Kay's first pair were coming down the pavilion steps.    Challis, going  to his place at short slip, called Silver's attention to a remarkable  fact.    \"Hullo,\" he said, \"why isn't Fenn coming in first?\"    \"What! By Jove, nor he is. That's queer. All the better for us. You  might get a bit finer, Challis, in case they snick 'em.\"    Wayburn, who had accompanied Fenn to the wicket at the beginning of  Kay's first innings, had now for his partner one Walton, a large,  unpleasant-looking youth, said to be a bit of a bruiser, and known to  be a black sheep. He was one of those who made life at Kay's so close  an imitation of an Inferno. His cricket was of a rustic order. He hit  hard and high. When allowed to do so, he hit often. But, as a rule, he  left early, a prey to the slips or deep fields. Today was no exception  to that rule.    Kennedy's first ball was straight and medium-paced. It was a little  too short, however, and Walton, letting go at it with a semi-circular  sweep like the drive of a golfer, sent it soaring over mid-on's head  and over the boundary. Cheers from the pavilion.    Kennedy bowled his second ball with the same purposeful air, and  Walton swept at it as before. There was a click, and Jimmy Silver, who  was keeping wicket, took the ball comfortably on a level with his  chin.    \"How's that?\"    The umpire's hand went up, and Walton went out--reluctantly, murmuring  legends of how he had not gone within a yard of the thing.    It was only when the next batsman who emerged from the pavilion turned  out to be his young brother and not Fenn, that Silver began to see  that something was wrong. It was conceivable that Fenn might have  chosen to go in first wicket down instead of opening the batting, but  not that he should go in second wicket. If Kay's were to win it was  essential that he should begin to bat as soon as possible. Otherwise  there might be no time for him to knock off the runs. However good a  batsman is, he can do little if no one can stay with him.    There was no time to question the newcomer. He must control his  curiosity until the fall of the next wicket.    \"Man in,\" he said.    Billy Silver was in many ways a miniature edition of his brother, and  he carried the resemblance into his batting. The head of Blackburn's  was stylish, and took no risks. His brother had not yet developed a  style, but he was very settled in his mind on the subject of risks.  There was no tempting him with half-volleys and long-hops. His motto  was defence, not defiance. He placed a straight bat in the path of  every ball, and seemed to consider his duty done if he stopped it.    The remainder of the over was, therefore, quiet. Billy played  Kennedy's fastest like a book, and left the more tempting ones alone.    Challis's first over realised a single, Wayburn snicking him to leg.  The first ball of Kennedy's second over saw him caught at the wicket,  as Walton had been.    \"Every _time_ a coconut,\" said Jimmy Silver complacently, as he  walked to the other end. \"We're a powerful combination, Kennedy.  Where's Fenn? Does anybody know? Why doesn't he come in?\"    Billy Silver, seated on the grass by the side of the crease, fastening  the top strap of one of his pads, gave tongue with the eagerness of  the well-informed man.    \"What, don't you know?\" he said. \"Why, there's been an awful row. Fenn  won't be able to play till four o'clock. I believe he and Kay had a  row last night, and he cheeked Kay, and the old man's given him a sort  of extra. I saw him going over to the School House, and I heard him  tell Wayburn that he wouldn't be able to play till four.\"    The effect produced by this communication would be most fittingly  expressed by the word \"sensation\" in brackets. It came as a complete  surprise to everyone. It seemed to knock the bottom out of the whole  match. Without Fenn the thing would be a farce. Kay's would have no  chance.    \"What a worm that man is,\" said Kennedy. \"Do you know, I had a sort of  idea Fenn wouldn't last out much longer. Kay's been ragging him all  the term. I went round to see him last night, and Kay behaved like a  bounder then. I expect Fenn had it out with him when they got indoors.  What a beastly shame, though.\"    \"Beastly,\" agreed Jimmy Silver. \"Still, it can't be helped. The sins  of the house-master are visited on the house. I'm afraid it will be  our painful duty to wipe the floor with Kay's this day. Speaking at a  venture, I should say that we have got them where the hair's short.  Yea. Even on toast, if I may be allowed to use the expression. Who is  this coming forth now? Curtis, or me old eyes deceive me. And is not  Curtis's record score three, marred by ten chances? Indeed yes. A  fastish yorker should settle Curtis's young hash. Try one.\"    Kennedy followed the recipe. A ball later the middle and leg stumps  were lying in picturesque attitudes some yards behind the crease, and  Curtis was beginning that \"sad, unending walk to the pavilion\",  thinking, with the poet,        \"Thou wast not made to play, infernal ball!\"    Blackburn's non-combatants, dotted round the boundary, shrieked their  applause. Three wickets had fallen for five runs, and life was worth  living. Kay's were"]]]
