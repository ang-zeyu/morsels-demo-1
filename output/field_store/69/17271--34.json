[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324"],[0,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus (#3)"],[1," voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our  good uncle Thomas's library. My education was neglected, yet I was  passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night,  and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as  a child, on learning that my father's dying injunction had forbidden my  uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.    These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets  whose effusions entranced my soul, and lifted it to heaven. I also  became a poet, and for one year lived in a Paradise of my own creation;  I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the  names of Homer and Shakspeare are consecrated. You are well acquainted  with my failure, and how heavily I bore the disappointment. But just at  that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were  turned into the channel of their earlier bent.    Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can,  even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great  enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied  the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily  endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder  than the common sailors during the day, and devoted my nights to the  study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of  physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest  practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a  Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must own I felt  a little proud, when my captain offered me the second dignity in the  vessel, and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness; so  valuable did he consider my services.    And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great  purpose? My life might have been passed in ease and luxury; but I  preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh,  that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage  and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are  often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage,  the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not  only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own,  when theirs are failing.    This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly  quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in  my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stage-coach. The  cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs,--a dress which I  have already adopted; for there is a great difference between walking  the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise  prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no  ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and  Archangel.    I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my  intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying  the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think  necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not  intend to sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah,  dear sister, how can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many  months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail,  you will see me again soon, or never.    Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on  you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for  all your love and kindness.    Your affectionate brother,    R. WALTON.          LETTER II.      _To Mrs. Saville, England._    Archangel, 28th March, 17--.    How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!  yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel,  and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already  engaged, appear to be men on whom I can depend, and are certainly  possessed of dauntless courage.    But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and the  absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil. I have  no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success,  there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by  disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I  shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium  for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who  could sympathise with me; whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem  me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I  have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as  well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or  amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor  brother! I am too ardent in execution, and too impatient of  difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am  self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a  common, and read nothing but our uncle Thomas's books of voyages. At  that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own  country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive  its most important benefits from such a conviction, that I perceived the  necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my  native country. Now I am twenty-eight, and am in reality more illiterate  than many schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more,  and that my day dreams are more extended and magnificent; but they want  (as the painters call it) _keeping_; and I greatly need a friend who  would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection  enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.    Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on  the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen.  Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in  these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful  courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory: or rather, to  word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his  profession. He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and  professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the  noblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted with him on  board a whale vessel: finding that he was unemployed in this city, I  easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.    The master is a person of an excellent disposition, and is remarkable in  the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This  circumstance, added to his well known integrity and dauntless courage,  made me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best  years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the  groundwork of my character, that I cannot overcome an intense distaste  to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it  to be necessary; and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his  kindliness of heart, and the respect and obedience paid to him by his  crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his  services. I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady  who owes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story.  Some years ago, he loved a young Russian lady, of moderate fortune; and  having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl  consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before the destined  ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and, throwing herself at his  feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she  loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never  consent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on  being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his  pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had  designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on  his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase  stock, and then himself solicited the young woman's father to consent to  her marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking  himself bound in honour to my friend; who, when he found the father  inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his  former mistress was married according to her inclinations. \"What a noble  fellow!\" you will exclaim. He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated:  he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends  him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts  from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.    Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little, or because I can  conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am  wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate; and my voyage is  only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The  winter has been dreadfully severe; but the spring promises well, and it  is considered as a remarkably early season; so that perhaps I may sail  sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me  sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness, whenever the  safety of others is committed to my care.    I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my  undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the  trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am  preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to \"the land of  mist and snow\"; but I shall kill no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4248"],[0,"The Problem of the Ohio Mounds (#3)"],[1,"to light the ashes and hearth that mark the place where the  fire was built, and occasionally unearth fragments of the vessels  used in cooking, the bones of animals on whose flesh the inmates  fed, and other articles pertaining to domestic use.    During the explorations of the Bureau in southeastern Missouri and  Arkansas, finding the remains of houses in low, flat mounds was a  common occurrence. Although the wood in most cases had  disappeared, what had not been converted to coals and ashes having  rotted away, yet the size and form, and, in part, the mode of  construction, were clearly indicated. The hard-tramped, circular,  earthen floor gave the size and form; the numerous fragments of  burnt clay forming a layer over the floor--often taken by  explorers for brick-revealed the method of plastering their  dwellings; the charred remains of grass and twigs showed that it  had been strengthened by this admixture; the impressions left on  the inner face of these lumps of burnt plastering revealed the  character of the lathing, which was in some cases branches and  twigs, but in others split cane. The roof was thatched with grass  or matting, the charred remains of which were found in more than  one instance. In probably nine cases out of ten it was apparent  these dwellings had been burned. This was found to be due to the  custom of burying the dead in the floor and burning the dwelling  over them, covering the remains with dirt often before the fire  had ceased burning.    As a general rule the strata are found in this order: (1) a top  layer of soil from 1 foot to 2 feet thick; (2) a layer of burnt  clay from 3 to 12 inches thick (though usually varying from 4 to 8  inches) and broken into lumps, never in a uniform, unbroken layer;  immediately below this (3) a thin layer of hardened muck or dark  clay, though this does not always seem to be distinct. At this  depth in the mounds of the eastern part of Arkansas are usually  found one or more skeletons.    Take, for example, the following statement by Dr. Edward Palmer in  regard to these beds:    As a general and almost universal rule, after removing a foot or  two of top soil, a layer of burnt clay in a broken or fragmentary  condition would be found, sometimes with impressions of grass or  twigs, and easily crumbled, but often hard, and stamped,  apparently, with an implement made of split reeds of comparatively  large size. This layer was often a foot thick, and frequently  burned to a brick-red or even to clinkers. Below this would be  found more or less ashes, and often 6 inches of charred grass  immediately over the skeletons. These skeletons were found lying  in all directions, some with the face up, others with it down, and  others on the side. With each of these were one or more vessels of  clay.    Remains of rectangular houses were also discovered, though much  less frequent than other forms. These consisted of three rooms,  two in front and one in rear. For example, Dr. Palmer found in a  broad platform like elevation not more than 3 feet high the  remains of a house of this form which he traced by the burnt clay.  The lines of the upright walls were very apparent, as also the  clay which must have fallen from them, and which raised the outer  marginal lines considerably higher than the inner area. Dr. Palmer  remarks:    The fire must have been very fierce, and the clay around the edges  was evidently at some height above the door, as I judge from the  irregular way in which it is scattered around the margins.    Excavations in the areas showed that they were covered with a  layer of burnt clay, uneven and broken; immediately below this a  layer of ashes 6 inches thick, and below this black loam. On these  areas large trees were growing, one a poplar 3 feet in diameter.  Below one of these floors were found a skeleton, some pottery, and  a pipe. A large oak formerly stood at this point, but it has been  blown down.    Subsequently the remains of another dwelling of precisely the same  form, that is, two square rooms joined and a third of the same  size immediately behind these two, were discovered in the same  region by Colonel Norris. In this case remnants of the upright  posts and reed lathing forming the walls were found, also the clay  plastering.    Prof. G. C. Swallow [Footnote: 8th Rept. Peabody Museum, 1875, pp.  17, 18.] describes a room formed of poles, lathed with split cane,  plastered with clay both inside and out, which he found in a mound  in southeastern Missouri. Colonel Norris found parts of the  decayed poles, plastering, and other remains of a similar house in  a large mound in the same section.    From the statements of the early writers, a few of which are given  here, it is evident that the houses of the Indians occupying this  region when first visited by the whites were very similar to those  of the mound-builders.    La Harpe, speaking of the tribes in some parts of Arkansas, says:  \"The Indians build their huts dome-fashion out of clay and reeds.\"  Schoolcraft says the Pawnees formerly built similar houses. In  Iberville's Journal [Footnote: Relation in Margry, Deconvertes,  4th part (March, 1699), p. 170] it is stated that the cabins of  the Bayogoulas were round, about 30 feet in diameter, and  plastered with clay to the height of a man. Adair says: \"They are  lathed with cane and plastered with mud from bottom to top within  and without with a good covering of straw.\"    Henri de Tonty, the real hero of the French discoveries on the  Mississippi, says the cabins of the Tensas were square, with the  roof dome-shaped, and that the walls were plastered with clay to  the height of 12 feet and were 2 feet thick. [Footnote: Relation  of Henry de Tonty in Margry, Decouvertes, vol. 1, 1876, p. 600]    A description of the Indian square houses of this southern section  by Du Pratz [Footnote: Hist. La., vol. 2, French ed., 1758, pp.  173-175; English ed., 1764, p. 359.] is so exactly in point that I  insert a translation of the whole, passage:    The cabins of the natives are all perfectly square; none of them  are less than 15 feet in extent in every direction, but there are  some which are more than 30. The following is their manner of  building them: The natives go into the new forest to seek the  trunks of young walnut trees of 4 inches in diameter and from 18  to 20 feet long; they plant the largest ones at the four corners  to form the breadth and the dome; but before fixing the others  they prepare the scaffolding; it consists of four poles fastened  together at the top, the lower ends corresponding to the four  corners; on these four poles others are fastened crosswise at a  distance of a foot apart; this makes a ladder with four sides, or  four ladders joined together.    This done, they fix the other poles in the ground in a straight  line between those of the corners; when they are thus planted they  are strongly bound to a pole which crosses them within each side  [of the house]. For this purpose large splints of stalks are used  to tie them at the height of 5 or 6 feet, according to the size of  the cabin, which forms the walls; these standing poles are not  more than 15 inches apart from each other; a young man then mounts  to the end of one of the corner poles with a cord in his teeth; he  fastens the cord to the pole, and as he mounts within, the pole  bends, because those who are below draw the cord to bend the pole  as much as is necessary; at the same time another young man fixes  the pole of the opposite corner in the same way; the two poles  being thus bent at a suitable height, they are fastened strongly  and evenly. The same is done with the poles of the two other  corners as they are crossed over the first ones. Finally all the  other poles are joined at the point, which makes altogether the  figure of a bower in a summer-house such as we have in France.  After this work they fasten sticks on the lower sides or walls at  a distance of about 8 inches across, as high as the pole of which  I have spoken, which forms the length of the wall.    These sticks being thus fastened, they make mud walls of clay, in  which they put a sufficient amount of Spanish moss; these walls  are not more than 4 inches thick; they leave no opening but the  door, which is only 2 feet in width by 4 in height; there are some  much smaller. They then cover the frame-work which I have just  described with mats of reeds, putting the smoothest on the inside  of the cabin, taking care to fasten them together so that they are  well joined.    After this they make large bundles of grass, of the tallest that  can be found in the low lands, and which is 4 or 5 feet long; this  is put on in the same way as straw which is used to cover thatched  houses; the grass is fastened with large canes, and splints, also  of canes. When the cabin is covered with grass they cover all with  a matting of canes well bound together, and at the bottom they  make a ring of \"bind-weeds\" all around the cabin, then they trim  the grass evenly, and with this defense, however strong the wind  may be, it can do nothing against the cabin. These coverings last  twenty years without being repaired.    Numerous other references to the same effect might be given, but  these are sufficient to show that the remains found in the mounds  of the South are precisely what would result from the destruction  by fire of the houses in use by the Indians when first encountered  by Europeans.    It is admitted now by all archaeologists that the ancient works of  New York are attributable to Indians, chiefly to the Iroquois  tribes. This necessarily carries with it the inference that works  of the same type, for instance those of northern Ohio and eastern  Michigan, are due to Indians. It is also admitted that the mounds  and burial pits of Canada are due, at least in part, to the  Hurons. [Footnote: David Boyle, Ann. Rept. Canadian Institute,  1886-1887, pp. 9-17; Ibid.,"]]]
