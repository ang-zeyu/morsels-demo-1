This is only a  surface view of Jewish history. If we pierce to its depths, and  scrutinize the processes that take place in its penetralia, we  perceive that even in the early period there were latent within it  great powers of intellect, universal principles, which, visibly or  invisibly, determined the course of events. We have before us not a  simple political or racial entity, but, to an eminent degree, \"a  spiritual people.\" The national development is based upon an  all-pervasive religious tradition, which lives in the soul of the  people as the Sinaitic Revelation, the Law of Moses. With this holy  tradition, embracing a luminous theory of life and an explicit code of  morality and social converse, was associated the idea of the election  of the Jewish people, of its peculiar spiritual mission. \"And ye shall  be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation\" is the figurative  expression of this ideal calling. It conveys the thought that the  Israelitish people as a whole, without distinction of rank and  regardless of the social prominence of individuals, has been called to  guide the other nations toward sublime moral and religious principles,  and to officiate for them, the laity as it were, in the capacity of  priests. This exalted ideal would never have been reached, if the  development of the Jewish people had lain along hackneyed lines; if,  like the Egyptians and the Chaldeans, it had had an inflexible caste  of priests, who consider the guardianship of the spiritual treasures  of the nation the exclusive privilege of their estate, and strive to  keep the mass of the people in crass ignorance. For a time, something  approaching this condition prevailed among the Jews. The priests  descended from Aaron, with the Temple servants (the Levites), formed a  priestly class, and played the part of authoritative bearers of the  religious tradition. But early, in the very infancy of the nation,  there arose by the side of this official, aristocratic hierarchy, a  far mightier priesthood, a democratic fraternity, seeking to enlighten  the whole nation, and inculcating convictions that make for a  consciously held aim. The Prophets were the real and appointed  executors of the holy command enjoining the \"conversion\" of all Jews  into \"a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\" Their activity cannot  be paralleled in the whole range of the world's history. They were not  priests, but popular educators and popular teachers. They were  animated by the desire to instil into every soul a deeply religious  consciousness, to ennoble every heart by moral aspirations, to  indoctrinate every individual with an unequivocal theory of life, to  inspire every member of the nation with lofty ideals. Their work did  not fail to leave its traces. Slowly but deeply idealism entered into  the very pith and marrow of the national consciousness. This  consciousness gained in strength and amplitude century by century,  showing itself particularly in the latter part of the first period,  after the crisis known as \"the Babylonian Exile.\" Thanks to the  exertions of the _Soferim_ (Scribes), directed toward the  broadest popularization of the Holy Writings, and constituting the  formal complement to the work of the Prophets, spiritual activity  became an integral part of Jewish national life. In the closing  centuries of its political existence, the Jewish people received its  permanent form. There was imposed upon it the unmistakable hallmark of  spirituality that has always identified it in the throng of the  nations. Out of the bosom of Judaism went forth the religion that in a  short time ran its triumphant course through the whole ancient world,  transforming races of barbarians into civilized beings. It was the  fulfilment of the Prophetical promise--that the nations would walk in  the light of Israel.    At the very moment when the strength and fertility of the Jewish mind  reached the culminating point, occurred a political revolution--the  period of homeless wandering began. It seemed as though, before  scattering the Jewish people to all ends of the earth, the providence  of history desired to teach it a final lesson, to take with it on its  way. It seemed to say: \"Now you may go forth. Your character has been  sufficiently tempered; you can bear the bitterest of hardships. You  are equipped with an inexhaustible store of energy, and you can live  for centuries, yea, for thousands of years, under conditions that  would prove the bane of other nations in less than a single century.  State, territory, army, the external attributes of national power, are  for you superfluous luxury. Go out into the world to prove that a  people can continue to live without these attributes, solely and alone  through strength of spirit welding its widely scattered particles into  one firm organism!\"--And the Jewish people went forth and proved it.    This \"proof\" adduced by Jewry at the cost of eighteen centuries of  privation and suffering, forms the characteristic feature of the  second half of Jewish history, the period of homelessness and  dispersion. Uprooted from its political soil, national life displayed  itself on intellectual fields exclusively. \"To think and to suffer\"  became the watchword of the Jewish people, not merely because forced  upon it by external circumstances beyond its control, but chiefly  because it was conditioned by the very disposition of the people, by  its national inclinations. The extraordinary mental energy that had  matured the Bible and the old writings in the first period, manifested  itself in the second period in the encyclopedic productions of the  Talmudists, in the religious philosophy of the middle ages, in  Rabbinism, in the Kabbala, in mysticism, and in science. The spiritual  discipline of the school came to mean for the Jew what military  discipline is for other nations. His remarkable longevity is due, I am  tempted to say, to the acrid spiritual brine in which he was cured. In  its second half, the originality of Jewish history consists indeed, in  the circumstance that it is the only history stripped of every active  political element. There are no diplomatic artifices, no wars, no  campaigns, no unwarranted encroachments backed by armed force upon the  rights of other nations, nothing of all that constitutes the chief  content--the monotonous and for the most part idea-less content--of  many other chapters in the history of the world. Jewish history  presents the chronicle of an ample spiritual life, a gallery of  pictures representing national scenes. Before our eyes passes a long  procession of facts from the fields of intellectual effort, of  morality, religion, and social converse. Finally, the thrilling drama  of Jewish martyrdom is unrolled to our astonished gaze. If the inner  life and the social and intellectual development of a people form the  kernel of history, and politics and occasional wars are but its  husk,[3] then certainly the history of the Jewish diaspora is all  kernel. In contrast with the history of other nations it describes,  not the accidental deeds of princes and generals, not external pomp  and physical prowess, but the life and development of a whole people.  It gives heartrending expression to the spiritual strivings of a  nation whose brow is resplendent with the thorny crown of martyrdom.  It breathes heroism of mind that conquers bodily pain. In a word,  Jewish history is history sublimated.[4]      [3] \"History, without these (inner, spiritual elements), is a      shell without a kernel; and such is almost all the history      which is extant in the world.\" (Macaulay, on Mitford's History      of Greece, Collected Works, i, 198, ed. A. and C. Armstrong      and Son.)      [4] A Jewish historian makes the pregnant remark: \"If ever the      time comes when the prophecies of the Jewish seers are      fulfilled, and nation no longer raises the sword against      nation; when the olive leaf instead of the laurel adorns the      brow of the great, and the achievements of noble minds are      familiar to the dwellers in cottages and palaces alike, then      the history of the world will have the same character as      Jewish history. On its pages will be inscribed, not the      warrior's prowess and his victories, nor diplomatic schemes      and triumphs, but the progress of culture and its practical      application in real life.\"    In spite of the noteworthy features that raise Jewish history above  the level of the ordinary, and assign it a peculiar place, it is  nevertheless not isolated, not severed from the history of mankind.  Rather is it most intimately interwoven with world-affairs at every  point throughout its whole extent. As the diameter, Jewish history is  again and again intersected by the chords of the historical circle.  The fortunes of the pilgrim people scattered in all the countries of  the civilized world are organically connected with the fortunes of the  most representative nations and states, and with manifold tendencies  of human thought. The bond uniting them is twofold: in the times when  the powers of darkness and fanaticism held sway, the Jews were  amenable to the \"physical\" influence exerted by their neighbors in the  form of persecutions, infringements of the liberty of conscience,  inquisitions, violence of every sort; and during the prevalence of  enlightment and humanity, the Jews were acted upon by the intellectual  and cultural stimulus proceeding from the peoples with whom they  entered into close relations. Momentary aberrations and reactionary  incidents are not taken into account here. On its side, Jewry made its  personality felt among the nations by its independent, intellectual  activity, its theory of life, its literature, by the very fact,  indeed, of its ideal staunchness and tenacity, its peculiar historical  physiognomy. From "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7838"],[0,"Fifty-One Tales (#3)"],[1,"us blemishing the night.    \"The woods are gone, O Pan, the woods, the woods. And thou art  far, O Pan, and far away.\"    I was standing by night between two railway embankments on the  edge of a Midland city. On one of them I saw the trains go by, once  in every two minutes, and on the other, the trains went by twice in  every five.    Quite close were the glaring factories, and the sky above them wore  the fearful look that it wears in dreams of fever.    The flowers were right in the stride of that advancing city, and  thence I heard them sending up their cry. And then I heard, beating  musically up wind, the voice of Pan reproving them from Arcady--    \"Be patient a little, these things are not for long.\"          TIME AND THE TRADESMAN      Once Time as he prowled the world, his hair grey not with weakness  but with dust of the ruin of cities, came to a furniture shop and entered  the Antique department. And there he saw a man darkening the wood  of a chair with dye and beating it with chains and making imitation  wormholes in it.    And when Time saw another doing his work he stood by him awhile  and looked on critically.    And at last he said: \"That is not how I work,\" and he turned the man's  hair white and bent his back and put some furrows in his little cunning  face; then turned and strode away, for a mighty city that was weary  and sick and too long had troubled the fields was sore in need of him.          THE LITTLE CITY      I was in the pre-destined 11.8 from Goraghwood to Drogheda, when  I suddenly saw the city. It was a little city in a valley, and only seemed  to have a little smoke, and the sun caught the smoke and turned it  golden, so that it looked like an old Italian picture where angels walk  in the foreground and the rest is a blaze of gold. And beyond, as one  could tell by the lie of land although one could not see through the  golden smoke, I knew that there lay the paths of the roving ships.    All round there lay a patchwork of small fields all over the slopes of  the hills, and the snow had come upon them tentatively, but already  the birds of the waste had moved to the sheltered places for every  omen boded more to fall. Far away some little hills blazed like an  aureate bulwark broken off by age and fallen from the earthward  rampart of Paradise. And aloof and dark the mountains stared  unconcernedly seawards.    And when I saw those grey and watchful mountains sitting where  they sat while the cities of the civilization of Araby and Asia arose  like crocuses, and like crocuses fell, I wondered for how long there  would be smoke in the valley and little fields on the hills.          THE UNPASTURABLE FIELDS      Thus spake the mountains: \"Behold us, even us; the old ones, the  grey ones, that wear the feet of Time. Time on our rocks shall break  his staff and stumble: and still we shall sit majestic, even as now,  hearing the sound of the sea, our old coeval sister, who nurses the  bones of her children and weeps for the things she has done.    \"Far, far, we stand above all things; befriending the little cities until  they grow old and leave us to go among the myths.    \"We are the most imperishable mountains.\"    And softly the clouds foregathered from far places, and crag on  crag and mountain upon mountain in the likeness of Caucasus upon  Himalaya came riding past the sunlight upon the backs of storms and  looked down idly from their golden heights upon the crests of the  mountains.    \"Ye pass away,\" said the mountains.    And the clouds answered, as I dreamed or fancied,    \"We pass away, indeed we pass away, but upon our unpasturable  fields Pegasus prances. Here Pegasus gallops and browses upon  song which the larks bring to him every morning from far terrestrial  fields. His hoof-beats ring upon our slopes at sunrise as though our  fields were of silver. And breathing the dawn-wind in dilated nostrils,  with head tossed upwards and with quivering wings, he stands and  stares from our tremendous heights, and snorts and sees far-future  wonderful wars rage in the creases and the folds of the togas that  cover the knees of the gods.\"          THE WORM AND THE ANGEL      As he crawled from the tombs of the fallen a worm met with an angel.    And together they looked upon the kings and kingdoms, and youths  and maidens and the cities of men. They saw the old men heavy in  their chairs and heard the children singing in the fields. They saw far  wars and warriors and walled towns, wisdom and wickedness, and  the pomp of kings, and the people of all the lands that the sunlight knew.    And the worm spake to the angel saying: \"Behold my food.\"    \"Be dakeon para Thina poluphloisboio Thalassaes,\" murmured the  angel, for they walked by the sea, \"and can you destroy that too?\"    And the worm paled in his anger to a greyness ill to behold, for for  three thousand years he had tried to destroy that line and still its  melody was ringing in his head.          THE SONGLESS COUNTRY      The poet came unto a great country in which there were no songs.  And he lamented gently for the nation that had not any little foolish  songs to sing to itself at evening.    And at last he said: \"I will make for them myself some little foolish  songs so that they may be merry in the lanes and happy by the  fireside.\" And for some days he made for them aimless songs such  as maidens sing on the hills in the older happier countries.    Then he went to some of that nation as they sat weary with the  work of the day and said to them: \"I have made you some aimless  songs out of the small unreasonable legends, that are somewhat akin  to the wind in the vales of my childhood; and you may care to sing  them in your disconsolate evenings.\"    And they said to him:    \"If you think we have time for that sort of nonsense nowadays  you cannot know much of the progress of modern commerce.\"    And then the poet wept for he said: \"Alas! They are damned.\"          THE LATEST THING      I saw an unclean-feeder by the banks of the river of Time. He crouched  by orchards numerous with apples in a happy land of flowers; colossal  barns stood near which the ancients had stored with grain, and the sun  was golden on serene far hills behind the level lands. But his back was  to all these things. He crouched and watched the river. And whatever  the river chanced to send him down the unclean-feeder clutched at  greedily with his arms, wading out into the water.    Now there were in those days, and indeed still are, certain uncleanly  cities upon the river of Time; and from them fearfully nameless things  came floating shapelessly by. And whenever the odor of these came  down the river before them the unclean-feeder plunged into the dirty  water and stood far out, expectant. And if he opened his mouth one  saw these things on his lips.    Indeed from the upper reaches there came down sometimes the  fallen rhododendron's petal, sometimes a rose; but they were useless  to the unclean-feeder, and when he saw them he growled.    A poet walked beside the river's bank; his head was lifted and his  look was afar; I think he saw the sea, and the hills of Fate from which  the river ran. I saw the unclean-feeder standing voracious, up to his  waist in that evil-smelling river.    \"Look,\" I said to the poet.    \"The current will sweep him away,\" the poet said.    \"But those cities that poison the river,\" I said to him.    He answered: \"Whenever the centuries melt on the hills of Fate the  river terribly floods.\"          THE DEMAGOGUE AND THE DEMI-MONDE      A demagogue and a demi-mondaine chanced to arrive together at  the gate of Paradise. And the Saint looked sorrowfully at them both.    \"Why were you a demagogue?\" he said to the first.    \"Because,\" said the demagogue, \"I stood for those principles that  have made us what we are and have endeared our Party to the great  heart of the people. In a word I stood unflinchingly on the plank of  popular representation.\"    \"And you?\" said the Saint to her of the demi-monde.    \"I wanted money,\" said the demi-mondaine.    And after some moments' thought the Saint said: \"Well, come in;  though you don't deserve to.\"    But to the demagogue he said: \"We genuinely regret that the limited  space at our disposal and our unfortunate lack of interest in those  Questions that you have gone so far to inculate and have so ably  upheld in the past, prevent us from giving you the support for which  you seek.\"    And he shut the golden door.          THE GIANT POPPY      I dreamt that I went back to the hills I knew, whence on a clear day  you can see the walls of Ilion and the plains of Roncesvalles. There  used to be woods along the tops of those hills with clearings in them  where the moonlight fell, and there when no one watched the fairies  danced.    But there were no woods when I went back, no fairies nor distant  glimpse of Ilion or plains of Roncesvalles, only one giant poppy waved  in the wind, and as it waved it hummed \"Remember not.\" And by its  oak-like stem a poet sat, dressed like a shepherd and playing an  ancient tune softly upon a pipe. I asked him if the fairies had passed  that way or anything olden.    He said: \"The poppy has grown apace and is killing gods and  fairies. Its fumes are suffocating the world, and its roots drain it  of its beautiful strength.\" And I asked him why he sat on the hills I  knew, playing an olden tune.    And he answered: \"Because the tune is bad for the poppy, which  would otherwise grow more swiftly; and because if the brotherhood  of which I am one were to cease to pipe on the hills men would stray  over the world and be lost or come to terrible ends. We think we have  saved Agamemnon.\"    Then he fell to piping again that olden tune, while the wind among the  poppy's sleepy petals murmured \"Remember not. Remember not.\"          ROSES      I know a roadside where the wild rose blooms with a strange  abundance. There is a beauty in the blossoms"]]]
