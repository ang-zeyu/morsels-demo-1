We  see that marriage exists, that all humanity--at least the larger  portion--lives conjugally, and that many husbands and wives honestly end  a long life together.\"    The nervous gentleman smiled ill-naturedly.    \"And what then? You say that marriage is based upon love, and when I  give voice to a doubt as to the existence of any other love than sensual  love, you prove to me the existence of love by marriage. But in our day  marriage is only a violence and falsehood.\"    \"No, pardon me,\" said the lawyer. \"I say only that marriages have  existed and do exist.\"    \"But how and why do they exist? They have existed, and they do exist,  for people who have seen, and do see, in marriage something sacramental,  a sacrament that is binding before God. For such people marriages exist,  but to us they are only hypocrisy and violence. We feel it, and, to  clear ourselves, we preach free love; but, really, to preach free love  is only a call backward to the promiscuity of the sexes (excuse me,  he said to the lady), the haphazard sin of certain raskolniks. The old  foundation is shattered; we must build a new one, but we must not preach  debauchery.\"    He grew so warm that all became silent, looking at him in astonishment.    \"And yet the transition state is terrible. People feel that haphazard  sin is inadmissible. It is necessary in some way or other to regulate  the sexual relations; but there exists no other foundation than the old  one, in which nobody longer believes? People marry in the old fashion,  without believing in what they do, and the result is falsehood,  violence. When it is falsehood alone, it is easily endured. The husband  and wife simply deceive the world by professing to live monogamically.  If they really are polygamous and polyandrous, it is bad, but  acceptable. But when, as often happens, the husband and the wife have  taken upon themselves the obligation to live together all their lives  (they themselves do not know why), and from the second month have  already a desire to separate, but continue to live together just the  same, then comes that infernal existence in which they resort to drink,  in which they fire revolvers, in which they assassinate each other, in  which they poison each other.\"    All were silent, but we felt ill at ease.    \"Yes, these critical episodes happen in marital life. For instance,  there is the Posdnicheff affair,\" said the lawyer, wishing to stop the  conversation on this embarrassing and too exciting ground. \"Have you  read how he killed his wife through jealousy?\"    The lady said that she had not read it. The nervous gentleman said  nothing, and changed color.    \"I see that you have divined who I am,\" said he, suddenly, after a  pause.    \"No, I have not had that pleasure.\"    \"It is no great pleasure. I am Posdnicheff.\"    New silence. He blushed, then turned pale again.    \"What matters it, however?\" said he. \"Excuse me, I do not wish to  embarrass you.\"    And he resumed his old seat.        CHAPTER III.    I resumed mine, also. The lawyer and the lady whispered together. I was  sitting beside Posdnicheff, and I maintained silence. I desired to talk  to him, but I did not know how to begin, and thus an hour passed until  we reached the next station.    There the lawyer and the lady went out, as well as the clerk. We were  left alone, Posdnicheff and I.    \"They say it, and they lie, or they do not understand,\" said  Posdnicheff.    \"Of what are you talking?\"    \"Why, still the same thing.\"    He leaned his elbows upon his knees, and pressed his hands against his  temples.    \"Love, marriage, family,--all lies, lies, lies.\"    He rose, lowered the lamp-shade, lay down with his elbows on the  cushion, and closed his eyes. He remained thus for a minute.    \"Is it disagreeable to you to remain with me, now that you know who I  am?\"    \"Oh, no.\"    \"You have no desire to sleep?\"    \"Not at all.\"    \"Then do you want me to tell you the story of my life?\"    Just then the conductor passed. He followed him with an ill-natured  look, and did not begin until he had gone again. Then during all the  rest of the story he did not stop once. Even the new travellers as they  entered did not stop him.    His face, while he was talking, changed several times so completely  that it bore positively no resemblance to itself as it had appeared just  before. His eyes, his mouth, his moustache, and even his beard, all were  new. Each time it was a beautiful and touching physiognomy, and these  transformations were produced suddenly in the penumbra; and for five  minutes it was the same face, that could not be compared to that of five  minutes before. And then, I know not how, it changed again, and became  unrecognizable.      CHAPTER IV.    \"Well, I am going then to tell you my life, and my whole frightful  history,--yes, frightful. And the story itself is more frightful than  the outcome.\"    He became silent for a moment, passed his hands over his eyes, and  began:--    \"To be understood clearly, the whole must be told from the beginning. It  must be told how and why I married, and what I was before my marriage.  First, I will tell you who I am. The son of a rich gentleman of the  steppes, an old marshal of the nobility, I was a University pupil, a  graduate of the law school. I married in my thirtieth year. But before  talking to you of my marriage, I must tell you how I lived formerly,  and what ideas I had of conjugal life. I led the life of so many other  so-called respectable people,--that is, in debauchery. And like the  majority, while leading the life of a debauche, I was convinced that I  was a man of irreproachable morality.    \"The idea that I had of my morality arose from the fact that in my  family there was no knowledge of those special debaucheries, so common  in the surroundings of land-owners, and also from the fact that my  father and my mother did not deceive each other. In consequence of this,  I had built from childhood a dream of high and poetical conjugal  life. My wife was to be perfection itself, our mutual love was to be  incomparable, the purity of our conjugal life stainless. I thought thus,  and all the time I marvelled at the nobility of my projects.    \"At the same time, I passed ten years of my adult life without hurrying  toward marriage, and I led what I called the well-regulated and  reasonable life of a bachelor. I was proud of it before my friends,  and before all men of my age who abandoned themselves to all sorts of  special refinements. I was not a seducer, I had no unnatural tastes,  I did not make debauchery the principal object of my life; but I found  pleasure within the limits of society's rules, and innocently believed  myself a profoundly moral being. The women with whom I had relations did  not belong to me alone, and I asked of them nothing but the pleasure of  the moment.    \"In all this I saw nothing abnormal. On the contrary, from the fact  that I did not engage my heart, but paid in cash, I supposed that I was  honest. I avoided those women who, by attaching themselves to me, or  presenting me with a child, could bind my future. Moreover, perhaps  there may have been children or attachments; but I so arranged matters  that I could not become aware of them.    \"And living thus, I considered myself a perfectly honest man. I did not  understand that debauchery does not consist simply in physical  acts, that no matter what physical ignominy does not yet constitute  debauchery, and that real debauchery consists in freedom from the moral  bonds toward a woman with whom one enters into carnal relations, and I  regarded THIS FREEDOM as a merit. I remember that I once tortured myself  exceedingly for having forgotten to pay a woman who probably had given  herself to me through love. I only became tranquil again when, having  sent her the money, I had thus shown her that I did not consider myself  as in any way bound to her. Oh, do not shake your head as if you were  in agreement with me (he cried suddenly with vehemence). I know these  tricks. All of you, and you especially, if you are not a rare exception,  have the same ideas that I had then. If you are in agreement with me, it  is now only. Formerly you did not think so. No more did I; and, if I had  been told what I have just told you, that which has happened would not  have happened. However, it is all the same. Excuse me (he continued):  the truth is that it is frightful, frightful, frightful, this abyss  of errors and debaucheries in which we live face to face with the real  question of the rights of woman.\" . . .    \"What do you mean by the 'real' question of the rights of woman?\"    \"The question of the nature of this special being, organized otherwise  than man, and how this being and man ought to view the wife. . . .\"        CHAPTER V.    \"Yes: for ten years I lived the most revolting existence, while dreaming  of the noblest love, and even in the name of that love. Yes, I want  to tell you how I killed my wife, and for that I must tell you how I  debauched myself. I killed her before I knew her.    \"I killed THE wife when I first tasted sensual joys without love, and  then it was that I killed MY wife. Yes, sir: it is only after having  suffered, after having tortured myself, that I have come to understand  the root of things, that I have come to understand my crimes. Thus you  will see where and how began the drama that has led me to misfortune.    \"It is necessary to go back to my sixteenth year, when I was still at  school, and my elder brother a first-year student.

In order to understand Marx's doctrine, it is  necessary to know something of the influences which  formed his outlook. He was born in 1818 at Treves  in the Rhine Provinces, his father being a legal  official, a Jew who had nominally accepted  Christianity. Marx studied jurisprudence, philosophy,  political economy and history at various German  universities. In philosophy he imbibed the doctrines  of Hegel, who was then at the height of his fame,  and something of these doctrines dominated his  thought throughout his life. Like Hegel, he saw in  history the development of an Idea. He conceived  the changes in the world as forming a logical development,  in which one phase passes by revolution into  another, which is its antithesis--a conception which  gave to his views a certain hard abstractness, and a  belief in revolution rather than evolution. But of  Hegel's more definite doctrines Marx retained nothing  after his youth. He was recognized as a brilliant  student, and might have had a prosperous career as  a professor or an official, but his interest in politics  and his Radical views led him into more arduous  paths. Already in 1842 he became editor of a newspaper,  which was suppressed by the Prussian Government  early in the following year on account of  its advanced opinions. This led Marx to go to Paris,  where he became known as a Socialist and acquired  a knowledge of his French predecessors.[1] Here in the  year 1844 began his lifelong friendship with Engels,  who had been hitherto in business in Manchester,  where he had become acquainted with English Socialism  and had in the main adopted its doctrines.[2] In  1845 Marx was expelled from Paris and went with  Engels to live in Brussels. There he formed a German  Working Men's Association and edited a paper  which was their organ. Through his activities in  Brussels he became known to the German Communist  League in Paris, who, at the end of 1847, invited him  and Engels to draw up for them a manifesto, which  appeared in January, 1848. This is the famous  ``Communist Manifesto,'' in which for the first time  Marx's system is set forth. It appeared at a fortunate  moment. In the following month, February,  the revolution broke out in Paris, and in March it  spread to Germany. Fear of the revolution led the  Brussels Government to expel Marx from Belgium,  but the German revolution made it possible for him  to return to his own country. In Germany he again  edited a paper, which again led him into a conflict  with the authorities, increasing in severity as the  reaction gathered force. In June, 1849, his paper  was suppressed, and he was expelled from Prussia.  He returned to Paris, but was expelled from there  also. This led him to settle in England--at that  time an asylum for friends of freedom--and in England,  with only brief intervals for purposes of agitation,  he continued to live until his death in 1883.      [1] Chief among these were Fourier and Saint-Simon, who  constructed somewhat fantastic Socialistic ideal commonwealths.  Proudhon, with whom Marx had some not wholly friendly relations,  is to be regarded as a forerunner of the Anarchists rather  than of orthodox Socialism.    [2] Marx mentions the English Socialists with praise in ``The  Poverty of Philosophy'' (1847). They, like him, tend to base  their arguments upon a Ricardian theory of value, but they  have not his scope or erudition or scientific breadth. Among  them may be mentioned Thomas Hodgskin (1787-1869), originally  an officer in the Navy, but dismissed for a pamphlet critical  of the methods of naval discipline, author of ``Labour Defended  Against the Claims of Capital'' (1825) and other works;  William Thompson (1785-1833), author of ``Inquiry into the  Principles of Distribution of Wealth Most Conducive to Human  Happiness'' (1824), and ``Labour Rewarded'' (1825); and  Piercy Ravenstone, from whom Hodgskin's ideas are largely  derived. Perhaps more important than any of these was Robert  Owen.      The bulk of his time was occupied in the composition  of his great book, ``Capital.''[3] His other  important work during his later years was the formation  and spread of the International Working Men's  Association. From 1849 onward the greater part  of his time was spent in the British Museum, accumulating,  with German patience, the materials for his  terrific indictment of capitalist society, but he  retained his hold on the International Socialist movement.  In several countries he had sons-in-law as  lieutenants, like Napoleon's brothers, and in the  various internal contests that arose his will generally  prevailed.      [3] The first and most important volume appeared in 1867;  the other two volumes were published posthumously (1885 and  1894).      The most essential of Marx's doctrines may be  reduced to three: first, what is called the material-  istic interpretation of history; second, the law of the  concentration of capital; and, third, the class-war.    1. The Materialistic Interpretation of History.--  Marx holds that in the main all the phenomena of  human society have their origin in material conditions,  and these he takes to be embodied in economic  systems. Political constitutions, laws, religions,  philosophies--all these he regards as, in their broad  outlines, expressions of the economic regime in the  society that gives rise to them. It would be unfair  to represent him as maintaining that the conscious  economic motive is the only one of importance; it  is rather that economics molds character and opinion,  and is thus the prime source of much that appears  in consciousness to have no connection with them.  He applies his doctrine in particular to two revolutions,  one in the past, the other in the future. The  revolution in the past is that of the bourgeoisie  against feudalism, which finds its expression, according  to him, particularly in the French Revolution.  The one in the future is the revolution of the wage-  earners, or proletariat, against the bourgeoisie,  which is to establish the Socialist Commonwealth.  The whole movement of history is viewed by him as  necessary, as the effect of material causes operating  upon human beings. He does not so much advocate  the Socialist revolution as predict it. He holds, it  is true, that it will be beneficent, but he is much more  concerned to prove that it must inevitably come.  The same sense of necessity is visible in his exposition  of the evils of the capitalist system. He does  not blame capitalists for the cruelties of which he  shows them to have been guilty; he merely points out  that they are under an inherent necessity to behave  cruelly so long as private ownership of land and  capital continues. But their tyranny will not last  forever, for it generates the forces that must in the  end overthrow it.    2. The Law of the Concentration of Capital.--  Marx pointed out that capitalist undertakings tend  to grow larger and larger. He foresaw the substitution  of trusts for free competition, and predicted  that the number of capitalist enterprises must diminish  as the magnitude of single enterprises increased.  He supposed that this process must involve a diminution,  not only in the number of businesses, but also  in the number of capitalists. Indeed, he usually  spoke as though each business were owned by a single  man. Accordingly, he expected that men would be  continually driven from the ranks of the capitalists  into those of the proletariat, and that the capitalists,  in the course of time, would grow numerically weaker  and weaker. He applied this principle not only to  industry but also to agriculture. He expected to  find the landowners growing fewer and fewer while  their estates grew larger and larger. This process  was to make more and more glaring the evils and  injustices of the capitalist system, and to stimulate  more and more the forces of opposition.    3. The Class War.--Marx conceives the wage-  earner and the capitalist in a sharp antithesis. He  imagines that every man is, or must soon become,  wholly the one or wholly the other. The wage-  earner, who possesses nothing, is exploited by the  capitalists, who possess everything. As the capitalist  system works itself out and its nature becomes more  clear, the opposition of bourgeoisie and proletariat  becomes more and more marked. The two classes,  since they have antagonistic interests, are forced  into a class war which generates within the capitalist  regime internal forces of disruption. The working  men learn gradually to combine against their  exploiters, first locally, then nationally, and at last  internationally. When they have learned to combine  internationally they must be victorious. They  will then decree that all land and capital shall be  owned in common; exploitation will cease; the tyranny  of the owners of wealth will no longer be  possible; there will no longer be any division of  society into classes, and all men will be free.    All these ideas are already contained in the  ``Communist Manifesto,'' a work of the most amazing  vigor and force, setting forth with terse compression  the titanic forces of the world, their epic battle, and  the inevitable consummation. This work is of such  importance in the development of Socialism and  gives such an admirable statement of the doctrines  set forth at greater length and with more pedantry  in ``Capital,'' that its salient passages must be  known by anyone who wishes to understand the hold  which Marxian Socialism has acquired over the intellect  and imagination of a large proportion of working-class  leaders.    ``A spectre is haunting Europe,'' it begins, ``the  spectre of"]]]
