The Importance of the Work.--Inquiring now into the importance of  the book, we note that Luther's impression evidently was perfectly  correct, when he wrote to Spalatin, long before its completion--as  early as March 2 5.--that he believed it to be better than anything he  had heretofore written.  The book, indeed, surpasses all his previous  German writings in volume, as well as all his Latin and German ones in  clearness, richness and the fundamental importance of its content. In  comparison with the prevalent urging of self-elected works of monkish  holiness, which had arisen from a complete misunderstanding of the  so-called evangelical counsels (comp. esp. Matthew 19:16-22) and which  were at that time accepted as self-evident and zealously urged by the  whole church, Luther's argument must have appeared to all thoughtful  and earnest souls as a revelation, when he so clearly amplified the  proposition that only those works are to be regarded as good works  which God has commanded, and that therefore, not the abandoning of  one's earthly calling, but the faithful keeping of the Ten Commandments  in the course of one's calling, is the work which God requires of us.  Over against the wide-spread opinion, as though the will of God as  declared in the Ten Commandments referred only to the outward work  always especially mentioned, Luther's argument must have called to mind  the explanation of the Law, which the Lord had given in the Sermon on  the Mount, when he taught men to recognize only the extreme point and  manifestation of a whole trend of thought in the work prohibited by the  text, and when he directed Christians not to rest in the keeping of the  literal requirement of each Commandment, but from this point of vantage  to inquire into the whole depth and breadth of God's will--positively  and negatively--and to do His will in its full extent as the heart has  perceived it. Though this thought may have been occasionally expressed  in the expositions of the Ten Commandments which appeared at the dawn  of the Reformation, still it had never before been so clearly  recognized as the only correct principle, much less had it been so  energetically carried out from beginning to end, as is done in this  treatise. Over against the deep-rooted view that the works of love must  bestow upon faith its form, its content and its worth before God, it  must have appeared as the dawn of a new era (Galatians 3:22-25) when  Luther in this treatise declared, and with victorious certainty carried  out the thought, that it is true faith which invests the works, even  the best and greatest of works, with their content and worth before God.    This proposition, which Luther here amplifies more clearly than ever  before, demanded nothing less than a breach with the whole of prevalent  religious views, and at that time must have been perceived as the  discovery of a new world, though it was no more than a return to the  clear teaching of the New Testament Scriptures concerning the way of  salvation. This, too, accounts for the fact that in this writing the  accusation is more impressively repelled than before, that the doctrine  of justification by faith alone resulted in moral laxity, and that, on  the other hand, the fundamental and radical importance of righteousness  by faith for the whole moral life is revealed in such a  heart-refreshing manner. Luther's appeal in this treatise to kings,  princes, the nobility, municipalities and communities, to declare  against the misuse of spiritual powers and to abolish various abuses in  civil life, marks this treatise as a forerunner of the great  Reformation writings, which appeared in the same year (1520), while, on  the other hand, his espousal of the rights of the \"poor man\"--to be met  with here for the first time--shows that the Monk of Witttenberg,  coming from the narrow limits of the convent, had an intimate and  sympathetic knowledge of the social needs of his time. Thus he proved  by his own example that to take a stand in the center of the Gospel  does not narrow the vision nor harden the heart, but rather produces  courage in the truth and sympathy for all manner of misery.    Luther's contemporaries at once recognized the great importance of the  Treatise, for within the period of seven months it passed through eight  editions; these were followed by six more editions between the years of  1521 and 1525; in 1521 it was translated into Latin, and in this form  passed through three editions up to the year 1525; and all this in  spite of the fact that in those years the so-called three great  Reformation writings of 1520 were casting all else into the shadow.  Melanchthon, in a contemporaneous letter to John Hess, called it  Luther's best book. John Mathesius, the well-known pastor at  Joachimsthal and Luther's biographer, acknowledged that he had learned  the \"rudiments of Christianity\" from it.    Even to-day this book has its peculiar mission to the Church. The  seeking after self-elected works, the indolence regarding the works  commanded of God, the foolish opinion, that the path of works leads to  God's grace and good-will, are even to-day widely prevalent within the  kingdom of God. To all this Luther's treatise answers: Be diligent in  the works of your earthly calling as commanded of God, but only after  having first strengthened, by the consideration of God's mercy, the  faith within you, which is the only source of all truly good works and  well-pleasing to God.    M. REU.    WARTBURG SEMINARY, DUBUQUE, IOWA.          TREATISE ON GOOD WORKS    1520    DEDICATION    JESUS      To the Illustrious, High-born Prince and Lord, John Duke of Saxony,  Landgrave of Thuringia, Margrave of Meissen, my gracious Lord and  Patron.      Illustrious, High-born Prince, gracious Lord! My humble duty and my  feeble prayer for your Grace always remembered!    For a long time, gracious Prince and Lord, I have wished to show my  humble respect and duty toward your princely Grace, by the exhibition  of some such spiritual wares as are at my disposal; but I have always  considered my powers too feeble to undertake anything worthy of being  offered to your princely Grace.    Since, however, my most gracious Lord Frederick, Duke of Saxony,  Elector and Vicar of the Holy Roman Empire, your Grace's brother, has  not despised, but graciously accepted my slight book, dedicated to his  electoral Grace, and now published--though such was not my intention, I  have taken courage from his gracious example and ventured to think that  the princely spirit, like the princely blood, may be the same in both  of you, especially in gracious kindness and good will. I have hoped  that your princely Grace likewise would not despise this my humble  offering which I have felt more need of publishing than an other of my  sermons or tracts. For the greatest of all questions has been raised,  the question of Good Works; in which is practised immeasurably more  trickery and deception than in anything else, and in which the  simpleminded man is so easily misled that our Lord Christ has commanded  us to watch carefully for the sheep's clothings under which the wolves  hide themselves.    Neither silver, gold, precious stones, nor any rare thing has such  manifold alloys and flaws as have good works, which ought to have a  single simple goodness, and without it are mere color, show and deceit.    And although I know and daily hear many people, who think slightingly  of my poverty, and say that I write only little pamphlets and German  sermons for the unlearned laity, this shall not disturb me. Would to  God I had in all my life, with all the ability I have, helped one  layman to be better! I would be satisfied, thank God, and be quite  willing then to let all my little books perish.    Whether the making of many great books is an art and a benefit to the  Church, I leave others to judge. But I believe that if I were minded to  make great books according to their art, I could, with God's help, do  it more readily perhaps than they could prepare a little discourse  after my fashion. If accomplishment were as easy as persecution, Christ  would long since have been cast out of heaven again, and God's throne  itself overturned.  Although we cannot all be writers, we all want to  be critics.    I will most gladly leave to any one else the honor of greater things,  and not be at all ashamed to preach and to write in German for the  unlearned laymen. Although I too have little skill in it, I believe  that if we had hitherto done, and should henceforth do more of it,  Christendom would have reaped no small advantage, and have been more  bene fited by this than by the great, deep books and quaestiones, which  are used only in the schools, among the learned.    Then, too, I have never forced or begged any one to hear me, or to read  my sermons. I have freely ministered in the Church of that which God  has given me and which I owe the Church. Whoever likes it not, may hear  and read what others have to say. And if they are not willing to be my  debtors, it matters little. For me it is enough, and even more than too  much, that some laymen condescend to read what I say. Even though there  were nothing else to urge me, it should be more than sufficient that I  have learned that your princely Grace is pleased with such German books  and is eager to receive instruction in Good Works and the Faith, with  which instruction it was my duty, humbly and with all diligence to  serve you.    Therefore, in dutiful humility I pray that your princely Grace may  accept this offering of mine with a gracious mind, until, if God grant  me time, I prepare a German exposition of the Faith in its entirety.  For at this time I have wished to show how in all good works we should  practice and make use of faith, and let faith be the chief work. If God  permit, I will treat at another"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],[0,"The Magic of Oz (#3)"],[1,"many precious stones  as I could carry.  So I had a lot of pockets made in my clothes and  loaded them all up.  Jewels are fine things to have with you when you  travel; you can trade them for anything.\"    \"Are they better than gold pieces?\" asked Kiki.    \"The smallest of these jewels is worth a hundred gold pieces such as  you stole from the old man.\"    \"Don't talk so loud,\" begged Kiki, uneasily.  \"Some one else might hear  what you are saying.\"    After supper they took a walk together, and the former Nome King said:    \"Do you know the Shaggy Man, and the Scarecrow, and the Tin Woodman,  and Dorothy, and Ozma and all the other Oz people?\"    \"No,\" replied the boy, \"I have never been away from Mount Munch until I  flew over the Deadly Desert the other day in the shape of a hawk.\"    \"Then you've never seen the Emerald City of Oz?\"    \"Never.\"    \"Well,\" said the Nome, \"I knew all the Oz people, and you can guess I  do not love them.  All during my wanderings I have brooded on how I can  be revenged on them.  Now that I've met you I can see a way to conquer  the Land of Oz and be King there myself, which is better than being  King of the Nomes.\"    \"How can you do that?\" inquired Kiki Aru, wonderingly.    \"Never mind how.  In the first place, I'll make a bargain with you.  Tell me the secret of how to perform transformations and I will give  you a pocketful of jewels, the biggest and finest that I possess.\"    \"No,\" said Kiki, who realized that to share his power with another  would be dangerous to himself.    \"I'll give you TWO pocketsful of jewels,\" said the Nome.    \"No,\" answered Kiki.    \"I'll give you every jewel I possess.\"    \"No, no, no!\" said Kiki, who was beginning to be frightened.    \"Then,\" said the Nome, with a wicked look at the boy, \"I'll tell the  inn-keeper that you stole that gold piece and he will have you put in  prison.\"    Kiki laughed at the threat.    \"Before he can do that,\" said he, \"I will transform myself into a lion  and tear him to pieces, or into a bear and eat him up, or into a fly  and fly away where he could not find me.\"    \"Can you really do such wonderful transformations?\" asked the old Nome,  looking at him curiously.    \"Of course,\" declared Kiki.  \"I can transform you into a stick of wood,  in a flash, or into a stone, and leave you here by the roadside.\"    \"The wicked Nome shivered a little when he heard that, but it made him  long more than ever to possess the great secret.  After a while he said:    \"I'll tell you what I'll do.  If you will help me to conquer Oz and to  transform the Oz people, who are my enemies, into sticks or stones, by  telling me your secret, I'll agree to make YOU the Ruler of all Oz, and  I will be your Prime Minister and see that your orders are obeyed.\"    \"I'll help do that,\" said Kiki, \"but I won't tell you my secret.\"    The Nome was so furious at this refusal that he jumped up and down with  rage and spluttered and choked for a long time before he could control  his passion.  But the boy was not at all frightened.  He laughed at the  wicked old Nome, which made him more furious than ever.    \"Let's give up the idea,\" he proposed, when Ruggedo had quieted  somewhat.  \"I don't know the Oz people you mention and so they are not  my enemies.  If they've kicked you out of your kingdom, that's your  affair--not mine.\"    \"Wouldn't you like to be king of that splendid fairyland?\" asked  Ruggedo.    \"Yes, I would,\" replied Kiki Aru; \"but you want to be king yourself,  and we would quarrel over it.\"    \"No,\" said the Nome, trying to deceive him.  \"I don't care to be King  of Oz, come to think it over.  I don't even care to live in that  country.  What I want first is revenge.  If we can conquer Oz, I'll get  enough magic then to conquer my own Kingdom of the Nomes, and I'll go  back and live in my underground caverns, which are more home-like than  the top of the earth.  So here's my proposition: Help me conquer Oz and  get revenge, and help me get the magic away from Glinda and the Wizard,  and I'll let you be King of Oz forever afterward.\"    \"I'll think it over,\" answered Kiki, and that is all he would say that  evening.    In the night when all in the Inn were asleep but himself, old Ruggedo  the Nome rose softly from his couch and went into the room of Kiki Aru  the Hyup, and searched everywhere for the magic tool that performed his  transformations.  Of course, there was no such tool, and although  Ruggedo searched in all the boy's pockets, he found nothing magical  whatever.  So he went back to his bed and began to doubt that Kiki  could perform transformations.    Next morning he said:    \"Which way do you travel to-day?\"    \"I think I shall visit the Rose Kingdom,\" answered the boy.    \"That is a long journey,\" declared the Nome.    \"I shall transform myself into a bird,\" said Kiki, \"and so fly to the  Rose Kingdom in an hour.\"    \"Then transform me, also, into a bird, and I will go with you,\"  suggested Ruggedo.  \"But, in that case, let us fly together to the Land  of Oz, and see what it looks like.\"    Kiki thought this over.  Pleasant as were the countries he had visited,  he heard everywhere that the Land of Oz was more beautiful and  delightful.  The Land of Oz was his own country, too, and if there was  any possibility of his becoming its King, he must know something about  it.    While Kiki the Hyup thought, Ruggedo the Nome was also thinking.  This  boy possessed a marvelous power, and although very simple in some ways,  he was determined not to part with his secret.  However, if Ruggedo  could get him to transport the wily old Nome to Oz, which he could  reach in no other way, he might then induce the boy to follow his  advice and enter into the plot for revenge, which he had already  planned in his wicked heart.    \"There are wizards and magicians in Oz,\" remarked Kiki, after a time.  \"They might discover us, in spite of our transformations.\"    \"Not if we are careful,\" Ruggedo assured him.  \"Ozma has a Magic  Picture, in which she can see whatever she wishes to see; but Ozma will  know nothing of our going to Oz, and so she will not command her Magic  Picture to show where we are or what we are doing.  Glinda the Good has  a Great Book called the Book of Records, in which is magically written  everything that people do in the Land of Oz, just the instant they do  it.\"    \"Then,\" said Kiki, \"there is no use our attempting to conquer the  country, for Glinda would read in her book all that we do, and as her  magic is greater than mine, she would soon put a stop to our plans.\"    \"I said 'people,' didn't I?\" retorted the Nome.  \"The book doesn't make  a record of what birds do, or beasts.  It only tells the doings of  people.  So, if we fly into the country as birds, Glinda won't know  anything about it.\"    \"Two birds couldn't conquer the Land of Oz,\" asserted the boy,  scornfully.    \"No; that's true,\" admitted Ruggedo, and then he rubbed his forehead  and stroked his long pointed beard and thought some more.    \"Ah, now I have the idea!\" he declared.  \"I suppose you can transform  us into beasts as well as birds?\"    \"Of course.\"    \"And can you make a bird a beast, and a beast a bird again, without  taking a human form in between?\"    \"Certainly,\" said Kiki.  \"I can transform myself or others into  anything that can talk.  There's a magic word that must be spoken in  connection with the transformations, and as beasts and birds and  dragons and fishes can talk in Oz, we may become any of these we desire  to.  However, if I transformed myself into a tree, I would always  remain a tree, because then I could not utter the magic word to change  the transformation.\"    \"I see; I see,\" said Ruggedo, nodding his bushy, white head until the  point of his hair waved back and forth like a pendulum.  \"That fits in  with my idea, exactly.  Now, listen, and I'll explain to you my plan.  We'll fly to Oz as birds and settle in one of the thick forests in the  Gillikin Country.  There you will transform us into powerful beasts,  and as Glinda doesn't keep any track of the doings of beasts we can act  without being discovered.\"    \"But how can two beasts raise an army to conquer the powerful people of  Oz?\" inquired Kiki.    \"That's easy.  But not an army of PEOPLE, mind you.  That would be  quickly discovered.  And while we are in Oz you and I will never resume  our human forms until we've conquered the country and destroyed Glinda,  and Ozma, and the Wizard, and Dorothy, and all the rest, and so have  nothing more to fear from them.\"    \"It is impossible to kill anyone in the Land of Oz,\" declared Kiki.    \"It isn't necessary to kill the Oz people,\" rejoined Ruggedo.    \"I'm afraid I don't understand you,\" objected the boy.  \"What will  happen to the Oz people, and what sort of an army could we get  together, except of people?\"    \"I'll tell you.  The forests of Oz are full of beasts.  Some of them,  in the far-away places, are savage and cruel, and would gladly follow a  leader as savage as themselves.  They have never troubled the Oz people  much, because they had no leader to urge them on, but we will tell them  to help us conquer Oz and as a reward we will transform all the beasts  into men and women, and let them live in the houses and enjoy all the  good things; and we will transform all the people of Oz into beasts of  various sorts, and send them to live in the forests and the jungles.  That is a splendid idea, you must admit, and it's so easy that we won't  have any trouble at all to carry it through to success.\"    \"Will the beasts consent, do you think?\" asked the boy.    \"To be sure they will.  We can get every beast in Oz on our  side--except a few who live in Ozma's palace, and they won't count.\"          4.  Conspirators      Kiki Aru didn't know much about Oz and didn't know much about the  beasts who lived there, but the old Nome's plan seemed to him to be  quite reasonable.  He had a faint suspicion that Ruggedo"]]]
