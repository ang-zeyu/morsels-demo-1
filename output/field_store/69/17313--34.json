[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46237"],[0,"The Romance of Book-Collecting (#3)"],[1,"vis,  an ancient bookseller of Oxford, who had fallen into the clutches of the  bailiffs.  The auctioneer commences with a dirge said, or perhaps sung,  over the miserable Davis: 'O the vanity of human wishes!  O the  changeableness of fate and its settled unkindness to us,' etc.  Each  book is extolled at length, and there are pages of lamentation and woe  as Hobbes of Malmesbury, his 'Leviathan,' 'a very large and famous  beast,' is knocked down, by mistake, for the miserable sum of five  pieces of silver.    An exhaustive chapter on early book auctions would necessarily commence  with the dispersion of the stock of Bonaventure and Abraham Elzevir at  Leyden in April, 1653; but the Elzevirs must look to themselves, nor are  these remarks intended to be even approximately full.  Rather are they  discursive, and in praise of catalogues in the mass; intended merely to  put someone else with more space and time at his disposal in the way of  rescuing them from the neglect into which they have fallen.  The next  chapter is more specific, for in that we will take a very famous sale of  less antiquity, and endeavour to draw comparisons between then and now.  And these comparisons will perhaps be very odious, for they will  necessarily appeal directly to the cupidity of every bookworm that  breathes, to every book-hunter who prowls around in search of rarities,  and returns home--empty handed.                                       *CHAPTER II.*                           *A COMPARISON OF PRICES.*      The important sale to which reference was made in the last chapter is  that of the library of John, Duke of Roxburghe, which was dispersed on  May 18, 1812, and forty-one following days, by Robert H. Evans, a  bookseller of Pall Mall.  This sale is of extreme interest for two  reasons.  In the first place, the collection was the most extensive,  varied, and important that had hitherto been offered for sale in  England, or indeed, anywhere else; and, secondly, it may fairly be  regarded in the light of a connecting-link between the old state of  things and the new. The Roxburghe library was not 'erected,' as Gabriel  Naudaeus has it, on traditional principles; it was of a general  character that appealed to all classes of book-men.  On the other hand,  it was not quite such a library as a collector of large means might be  expected to get together at the present day, for the tendency is now to  specialize, and in any case many of the books that the Duke obviously  took an interest in are of such little importance now, and so  infrequently inquired for, that they would most assuredly be refused  admission to any private library of equal importance and magnitude.  Even a general lover would hardly be likely to manifest much interest in  a number of volumes on Scots law or to hob-a-nob with Cheyne, who in  1720 wrote a book on the gout, or with Sir R. Blackmore, notwithstanding  that eminent physician's great experience of the spleen and vapours.  That lore of this kind has its merits I dispute in no way, but it is not  exactly of a kind to interest the modern collector, who, even if he aim  at all branches of literature alike, would much prefer to have his legal  and medical instruction boiled down, so to speak, to the compass of a  good digest or cyclopaedia.    Nevertheless, May 18, 1812, is among the _fasti_ of those who to a love  of letters add a passion for books.  It is the opening day of the new  regime--the birthday, in fact, of those who revel in first editions and  early English texts. Brunet said that the 'thermometer of  bibliomania'--objectionable word!--'attained its maximum in England'  during these forty-two days of ceaseless hammering, and Dibdin went  perfectly insane whenever he thought of this 'Waterloo among  book-battles,' as he called it.  Everyone of course knows the chief  episode; that struggle between Earl Spencer and the Marquis of Blandford  for the 1471 Boccaccio, in its faded yellow morocco binding, and how the  latter carried it off for L2,260, a most idiotic price to pay, as  subsequent events abundantly proved; for seven years later, when Lord  Blandford's library came to be sold, the coveted volume was acquired by  his former rival for considerably less than half the money. It now  reposes in state at Manchester, or, as some choose to say, is in prison  there, though it is perhaps too much to expect that all good things  should be forcibly removed to London, as some greedy Metropolitans wish  them to be.    The Duke of Roxburghe's library comprised rather more than 10,000 works  in about 30,000 volumes, and the auctioneer's method of classifying this  large assortment was so peculiar that he feels constrained to apologize  for it in a rather extensive preface.    'For instance,' says he, 'the _Festyvale_ of Caxton, printed in two  columns, of which no other copy is at present known, may be found  classed with a small edition of the Common Prayer of one shilling  value.'    The 'Festyval' brought L105, and the little Prayer-Book, which proves to  have been printed at London in 1707, 8s. 6d., which is more than it  would be at all likely to sell for now.  But what about Caxton's lordly  tome; how much might that be expected to bring in case it should once  again find its way into the open market?  Judging from the present price  of Caxtons, perhaps five or six times the money would not be an  impossible figure, but there is no telling.  It might bring more, even  though it has the misfortune to belong to the second edition, for only  six copies are known, and several of those are imperfect. Of the first  edition of 1483, only three perfect copies are to be met with, and that  is, of course, quite a different matter.  The auctioneer need not, as it  happens, have sought to excuse himself so energetically for placing good  and bad books side by side, for the whole catalogue is arranged under  subjects, and to do otherwise would have been manifestly impossible.  He  might, however, have entered somewhat more fully into detail as to  condition and binding, for some of the books were, confessedly, 'thumbed  to tatters,' and a suspicion that this or that 'lot' may be so afflicted  lurks in every page of the catalogue.    The first book brought to the hammer at this sale; the preliminary  bombshell which, to pursue Dibdin's metaphor, was the signal for a  furious cannonade, consisted of the 'Biblia Sacra Graeca,' printed by  Aldus in 1518.  This is the first complete edition of the Bible in  Greek, and an important book on that account.  It brought L4 15s., and  any book-hunter might heartily pray for half a dozen copies now, on the  same terms, for the present auction value runs to about six times as  much.  In fact, a sound copy sold only the other day for L27.  So, too,  Schoiffer's Latin Bible, printed at Mayence in 1472, folio, would be  considered cheap now at L8 8s., assuming nothing was wrong with it.  In  1893 a copy in oak boards brought L20 exactly.  On the other hand,  Baskerville's Bible, Cambridge, 1763, was excessively dear at L10 15s.,  seeing that a very fair copy can be got at the present time for about L1  10s. Collectors of Bibles are responsible for much of the terrible  confusion that takes place when we begin to draw comparisons in matters  of filthy lucre.  If a Bible come from a noted press, or is an original  edition of its version, or very old indeed, then up goes the price,  especially if it be printed in English.  One would have thought that  Baskerville being an Englishman, and a fine printer in his way, would  have been good for much more than L1 10s.  But no; he has not been dead  long enough, for the collectors have made it a rule that no English  Bible printed after 1717 is any good at all, and consequently that the  'Vinegar Bible' is the last book of the kind in point of date worth  looking at, unless, indeed, exception be made in favour of one of the  six large-paper copies of Bentham's Cambridge Bible of 1762, which are  reported to have luckily escaped a conflagration. The late Mr. Dore, who  was a strong man on the subject of old Bibles, says that a little  research would reveal the existence of many more than the traditional  half-dozen copies, so perhaps, after all, the conflagration is a myth.  But if Baskerville's Bible brought what we should now consider to be an  outrageous sum, what shall be said of 'The Holy Bible, illustrated with  Prints, published by T. Macklin, six volumes, folio, 1800,' which went  for L43, incomplete though it was.  Some L2 10s. for the whole seven  volumes is not at all an uncommon auction price at the present day, and  this amount and more would most certainly be swallowed up by the binding  alone.  What it comes to is that among all these books of theology,  Biblical comment, criticism, polemics, sermons, and works of the  Fathers, prices have fallen since 1812, except in those cases where  collectors have stepped in to rescue old Bibles, works associated with  some great religious revolution, or specimens of rare typography from  the presses of old and noted printers.    For instance, there was here another Caxton called 'The Prouffytable  boke for Mane's Soul,' folio, described as 'a beautiful copy,' which  went for L140, and 'A Lytell Treatyse called Lucydarye,' 4to., Wynkyn de  Worde, which brought L10.  During the last dozen years the former book  has appeared twice.  At the Earl of Aylesford's sale in March, 1888, it  brought (in company with 'The Tretyse of the Love of Jhesu Christ,' by  Wynkyn de Worde, 1493) L305, and in July, 1889, an inferior copy, badly  wormed, sold for L100.    These are the sort of books beloved by large public libraries, which are  fast swallowing up the few that remain.  From a pecuniary point of view  it would perhaps pay some rich book-hunter of the Lenox type to buy up  everything of the kind he could lay his hands on, though the worst of  speculations such as these is that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46303"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 6 (of 8) (#3)"],[1,"forces in Orange River      Colony, succeeded in crossing the river at Sand Drift.    14.--Animated chases after De Wet.    23.--De Wet succeeded in recrossing the river after losing 200      prisoners, all his guns, ammunition, and waggons.    27.--Lengthy negotiations for the promotion of peace took place between      Lord Kitchener and Commandant Botha, which negotiations eventually      fell to the ground.
