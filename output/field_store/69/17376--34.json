Phâre okhâ naibâ, sikhauâ,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53526"],[0,"Cardinal Wolsey (#3)"],[1," the course of civilisation would have been widely  different. For good or for evil the fortunes of England were given a  decided direction by Henry VIII.'s advance into the sphere of European  politics. England took up a position from which she could not afterwards  retire.    It is scarcely worth while to inquire if Henry VIII. could by prudence  and caution have continued to keep clear of the complications of  European politics, and make England strong by husbanding its resources  and developing its commerce. Such a course of action was not deemed  possible by any one. All classes alike believed that national prosperity  followed upon the assertion of national power. The commercial interests  of England would have had little chance of being respected unless they  were connected with political interests as well. If Henry VIII. had  lived frugally like his father, and avoided adventurous schemes for  which he needed the money of his people, the English monarchy would have  become a despotism, and the royal will would have been supreme in all  internal affairs. England was not exposed to this danger. Henry VIII.,  when he ascended the throne at the age of nineteen, was fully imbued by  the spirit of his time. The story goes that when Leo X. was elected Pope  he turned to his brother and said with a smile, \"Let us enjoy the  Papacy, since God has given it to us.\" Henry VIII. was resolved to enjoy  his kingship to the full; he wished to show Europe that he was every  inch a king, and equal to the best.    Henry VIII. in his early days had been educated with a view to high  ecclesiastical preferment, and was a youth of many accomplishments of  mind and body. His tall stalwart frame, his fair round face and  profusion of light hair, his skill in athletic exercises, made the  Venetian envoy pronounce him to be the handsomest and most capable king  in Christendom. He inherited the geniality, the physical strength, the  resoluteness of the Yorkist house, and combined them with the  self-restraint and caution of the Lancastrians. No king began his reign  with greater popularity, and the belief in the soundness of his head and  heart filled all men with hopes of a long period of just and prosperous  government. But many hoped for more than this. The reign of Henry VII.  had been successful, but inglorious. The strong character and the  generous impulses of the new ruler were not likely to be satisfied with  the cautious intrigues and petty calculations of his father. England  looked forward to a glorious and distinguished future. It believed in  its king, and clave to its belief in spite of many disappointments. Not  all the harsh doings of Henry VIII. exhausted the popularity with which  he began his reign, and in the midst of his despotism he never lost his  hold upon the people.    So Henry VIII. carried out the plan which his father had formed for him.  He married Katharine, his brother's widow, and so confirmed the alliance  with Ferdinand of Spain. He renewed the marriage treaty between his  sister Mary and Charles, Prince of Castile, heir of the Netherlands, and  eldest grandson of Ferdinand and Maximilian alike. Charles was only a  boy of nine, and had great prospects of a large heritage. England was  likely, if this arrangement were carried out, to be a useful but humble  ally to the projects of the houses of Hapsburg and Spain, useful because  of its position, which commanded the Channel, and could secure  communications between the Netherlands and Spain, humble because it had  little military reputation or capacity for diplomacy.    The alliance, however, between Ferdinand and Maximilian was by no means  close. Ferdinand by his marriage with Isabella had united the kingdoms  of Castile and Arragon; but after Isabella's death he had no claim to  the Crown of Castile, which passed to his daughter Juana. Already  Juana's husband, the Archduke Philip, had claimed the regency of  Castile, and Ferdinand was only saved by Philip's death from the peril  of seeing much of his work undone. The claim to Castile had now passed  to the young Charles, and Ferdinand was afraid lest Maximilian should at  any time revive it in behalf of his grandson. He was unwilling to help  in any way to increase Maximilian's power, and rejoiced that in the  results of the League of Cambrai little profit fell to Maximilian's  share. The Pope gained all that he wished; Ferdinand acquired without a  blow the Venetian possessions in the Neapolitan kingdom; the French arms  were triumphant in North Italy; but Venice continued to offer a stubborn  resistance to Maximilian. In vain Maximilian implored Ferdinand's help.  He was unmoved till the successes of the French awakened in his mind  serious alarm. The authors of the League of Cambrai began to be afraid  of the catastrophe which they had caused. They did not wish to see the  French supreme in Italy, but their combination had gone far to ensure  the French supremacy.    Pope Julius II. felt himself most directly threatened by the growth of  the French power. He resolved to break up the League of Cambrai, and so  undo his own work. He tried to gain support from the Swiss and from  England. He released Venice from her excommunication, and showed himself  steadfastly opposed to France. He did his utmost to induce Ferdinand and  Maximilian to renounce the League. Ferdinand was cautious, and only gave  his secret countenance to the Pope's designs. Maximilian, anxious to  make good his claims against Venice, wavered between an alliance with  France and a rupture. Louis XII. of France was embarrassed by the  hostility of the Pope, whom he tried to terrify into submission. His  troops advanced against Bologna, where Julius II. was residing. The Pope  fled, but the French forces did not pursue him. Louis was not prepared  to treat the Pope as merely a temporal sovereign, and Rome was spared a  siege. But Louis was so ill-judging as to attack the Pope on his  spiritual side. He raised the old cry of a General Council for the  reform of the Church, and drew to his side a few disaffected cardinals,  who summoned a Council to assemble at Pisa.    This half-hearted procedure was fatal to all hopes of French supremacy.  Had Louis XII. promptly dealt with Julius II. by force of arms he would  have rendered the Pope powerless to interfere with his political plans,  and no one would have interposed to help the Pope in his capacity of an  Italian prince. But when the French king showed that he was afraid of  the papal dignity in temporal matters, while he was ready to attack it  in spiritual matters, he entered upon a course of action which was  dangerous to Europe. Ferdinand was waiting for a good pretext to free  himself from further share in the policy of the League of Cambrai, and  Louis provided him with the pretext which he sought. Shocked at the  danger of a new schism, Ferdinand, in October 1511, entered into a  League with the Pope and Venice, a League which took the high-sounding  title of the Holy League, since it was formed for the protection of the  Papacy.    Of this Holy League Henry VIII. became a member in December, and so  stepped boldly into the politics of Europe. He was at first a submissive  son of King Ferdinand, whose daughter, Queen Katharine, acted as Spanish  ambassador at the English Court. Henry wished to make common cause with  his father-in-law, and trusted implicitly to him for assurances of  goodwill. He made a separate accord with Ferdinand that a combined army  should invade Guienne. If the French were defeated Ferdinand would be  able to conquer Navarre, and England would seize Guienne. The gain to  England would be great, as Guienne would be a secure refuge for English  commerce, and its possession would make the English king an important  personage in Europe, for he would stand between Spain and France.    The scheme was not fantastic or impossible, provided that Ferdinand was  in earnest. Henry believed in his good faith, but he still had the  confidence of youth. Ferdinand trusted no one, and if others were like  himself he was wise in his distrust. Every year he grew more suspicious  and fonder of crooked ways. He took no man's counsel; he made fair  professions on every side; his only object was to secure himself at the  least cost. His confiding son-in-law was soon to discover that Ferdinand  only meant to use English gold as a means for furthering his own designs  against France; he did not intend that England should have any share in  the advantage.    Unconscious of the selfishness of his ally, Henry VIII. prepared for war  in the winter of 1512. In these preparations the capacity of Thomas  Wolsey first made itself felt, and the course of the war that followed  placed Wolsey foremost in the confidence of the English king.           CHAPTER II   THE FRENCH ALLIANCE   1512-1515      Thomas Wolsey was born at Ipswich, probably in March 1471. He was the  son of Robert Wolsey and Joan his wife. Contemporary slander, wishing to  make his fortunes more remarkable or his presumption more intolerable,  represented his father as a man of mean estate, a butcher by trade.  However, Robert Wolsey's will shows that he was a man of good position,  probably a grazier and wool merchant, with relatives who were also  well-to-do. Thomas seems to have been the eldest of his family, and his  father's desire was that he should enter the priesthood. He showed  quickness in study; so much so that he went to Oxford at the early age  of eleven, and became Bachelor of Arts when he was fifteen. His studies  do not seem to have led him in the direction of the new learning; he was  well versed in the theology of the schools, and is said to have been a  devoted adherent to the system of St. Thomas Aquinas. But it was not by  the life of a student or the principles of a philosopher that Wolsey  rose to eminence. If he learned anything in his University career he  learned a knowledge of men and "]]]
