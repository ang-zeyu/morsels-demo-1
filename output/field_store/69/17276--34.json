He also told me  that we would have to delay our departure until every team present in  the town had its cumulation of cargo. They dared not travel singly, he  said, for the Indians were very hostile. In consequence whereof our  departure was delayed for six weeks. I camped with the Mexicans and  accustomed myself very soon to their mode of living. The fact that I  understood their language and spoke it quite well was a never-ending  surprise and mystery to them. I took dally walks over the prairie to  the junction of two creeks, a short distance from the town, bathed and  whiled away the time with target practice, and soon became very  proficient in the use of firearms.    The banks of these little streams would have made a delightful picnic  ground, covered as they were by a luxuriant growth of grasses and  bushes and some large trees also, mostly of the cottonwood variety. But  there were no families of ladies and children here to enjoy the lovely  spot. A feeling of intense uneasiness seemed to pervade the very air  and a weird presentiment of impending horror covered the prairie as  with a ghostly shroud. The specter of a wronged, persecuted race ever  haunted the white man's conscience. In vain did the red man breast the  rising tide of civilization. In their sacred tepees, their medicine men  invoked the aid of their great Spirit and they were answered.    The Spirit sent them for an ally, an army of grasshoppers, which  darkened the sun by its countless numbers. It impeded the progress of  the iron horse, but not for long. Then he sent them continued drouth,  but the pale face heeded not. \"Onward, westward ever, the star of  empire took its course.\"    We camped out on the prairie within a short distance and in full sight  of the town. I made the acquaintance of a merchant, Mr. Samuel  Dreifuss, who kept a little store of general merchandise. This  gentleman liked to converse with me in the German tongue and was very  kind to me, even offering to employ me at a liberal salary, which I, of  course, thankfully declined. One morning after breakfast I went to this  store to purchase an article of apparel. The door was unlocked and I  entered, but found no one present. I waited a while, and as Mr.  Dreifuss did not appear, I knocked at the bedroom door, which was  connected with the store. Receiving no response to my knocks, I opened  the door and entered. There was poor Mr. Dreifuss lying stone dead on  his couch. I knew that he was dead, for his hands were cold and clammy  to the touch. I was struck with astonishment. The day before had I  spoken to him, when he appeared to be hale and hearty. There were some  ugly, black spots on his face, and I thought that it was very queer. I  did not see any marks of violence on his person and nothing unusual  about the premises. I looked around carefully, as a boy is apt to do  when something puzzles him. Then I thought I would go up-town and tell  about this strange circumstance.    The store was the first building met with in the town if a person came  from the railway station. As I went toward the next house, which was a  short distance away, I was hailed by a tall, broad-shouldered man with  long hair, who commanded me to halt. I kept right on, however, meaning  to tell him about my gruesome discovery. As I advanced toward him he  retreated, and I called to him to have no fear, as I did not intend to  shoot. The big man shook with laughter and cried, \"Hold, boy, stop  there a minute until I tell you something. They say that 'Wild Bill'  never feared man, but I fear you, a mere boy. Did you come out of that  store?\" \"Yes, sir,\" I said. \"And did you see the Jew?\" \"Yes, sir,\" I  answered; \"Mr. Dreifuss is dead.\" \"How do you know that?\" he  questioned. \"His hands feel cold as ice,\" I said, \"and there is a black  spot on his nose.\" Again the man laughed and said, \"Do you know what  killed him?\" \"I do not know, sir,\" I answered, \"but I was going uptown  to inquire.\" \"Well,\" said the scout, \"Mr. Dreifuss had the cholera.\"  \"That's too bad,\" said I; \"let us go back and see if we can be of any  assistance.\" \"No, you don't,\" said the long-haired scout; \"I have been  stationed here, as marshal of the town, to warn people away from the  place. You take my advice and go to the creek and plunge in with all  your clothes and play for an hour in the water, then dry yourself, go  back to camp, and keep mum!\" This was the year of the cholera. It  started somewhere down south, and many people died from it in the city  of St. Louis, and it followed the railway through Kansas to the end of  the track. Many soldiers died also at Fort Harker, which was farther  out West on the plains.    At last we started on our perilous journey, an imposing caravan of one  hundred and eighty wagons, each drawn by five yoke of oxen. Our force  numbered upward of two hundred and fifty men, the owners, teamsters,  train masters or mayordomos and the herders of the different outfits;  all were Mexicans except myself.    Several days were spent in crossing the little stream formed by the  confluence of two creeks. The water was quite deep and had to be  crossed by means of a ferryboat. Here I met with my first adventure,  which nearly cost me my life. My wagon was loaded with supplies and  provisions and with several pieces of oak timber, intended for use in  our train. When I drove down the steep bank on to the ferryboat, the  timbers, which were not well secured, slid forward and pushed me off my  seat, so that I fell right under the mules just as they stepped on the  ferry. The frightened mules trampled and kicked fearfully. I lay still,  thinking that if I moved they would step on me, as their hoofs missed  my head by inches only. I thought of my mother and how sorry she would  be if she could see me now, but I was thinking, ever thinking and lay  very still. Then my guardian angel, in the person of a Mexican, crawled  under the wagon from the rear end and pulled me by my heels, back to  safety under the wagon. When I came out from under I threw my hat in  the air and gave a whoop and cheer, at which the Mexicans were greatly  enthused. They yelled excitedly and our mayordomo exclaimed: \"Caramba,  mira que diablito!\" (Egad, see the little devil!)    We traveled in two parallel lines, about fifty feet apart and kept the  spare cattle and remounts of horses, as also the small provision teams  between the lines. A cavalcade of train owners and mayordomos was  constantly scouting in all directions, but they never ventured out of  sight of the traveling teams. We started daily at sunrise and traveled  till noon or until we made the distance to our next watering place.  Then we camped and turned our live stock out to rest and crop the  prairie grass. After several hours we used to resume our journey until  nightfall or later to our next camping ground. Every man had to take  his turn about at herding cattle and horses during the nighttime. Only  the cooks were exempt from doing herd and guard duty.    We pitched our nightly camps by forming two closed half circles of our  wagons, one on each side of the road so as to form a corral. By means  of connecting the wagons with chains, this made a strong barricade,  quite efficient to repulse the attacks of hostile Indians, if defended  by determined men. Every freight train when in camp was a little fort  in itself and an interesting sight at nighttime, when the blazing fires  were surrounded by men who were cooking and passing the time in various  ways. Some were cleaning and loading their guns, others mended their  clothes. Here and there you would find some genius playing dreamy,  monotonous Spanish airs on the guitar, in the midst of a merry group of  dancing and singing young Mexicans, many of whom were not older than I.  Card-playing seemed, however, to be their favorite pastime; all  Mexicans are inveterate gamesters, who look upon the profession of  gambling as an honorable and desirable occupation.    After the first day out I did not see an inebriated man in the whole  party. The Mexicans are really a much maligned and slandered people.  They are often charged with the sin of postponing every imaginable  thing until manana, but, to do them justice, I must say that they drank  every drop of liquor they carried on the first day out; also ate all  the dainties which other people would have saved and relished for days  to come. Surely, not manana, but ahora, or \"do it now\" was their  soul-stirring battle cry on this occasion.    After several days of travel we encountered herds of buffalo and  mustangs or wild horses, and when our scouts reported numerous Indian  signs, we advanced slowly and carefully, momentarily expecting an  ambuscade and attack. Our column halted frequently while our horsemen  explored suspicious-looking hillocks and ravines.    A dense column of smoke rose suddenly in our front, and I saw several  detachments of Indian warriors on a little hill, who were evidently  reconnoitering, and spying our strength, but did not expose themselves  fully to view. Simultaneously columns of signal smoke arose in all  directions round about. Instantly our lines closed in the front and  rear and we came to an abrupt halt. What I saw then made my heart sink,  for the drivers seemed to be paralyzed with terror. The very men who  had heretofore found a great delight in trying to frighten me with  tales of Indian atrocities were now themselves scared out of their  wits. Young and inexperienced though I was, I realized that to be now  attacked by Indians meant to be slaughtered and scalped. Some of the  men were actually crying from fright, seeming to be completely  demoralized. I noticed how one of our men in loading his musket rammed  home a slug of lead, forgetting his charge of powder entirely. The  sight of this disgusted me so that I became furious, and in the measure  that my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43008"],[0,"Around the Yule Log (#3)"],[1,"iceman's hand, and at the same time the Shadow  vanished, leaving the light from the bright, warm hall falling fairly  upon the snow-covered cap and buttons.    A muffled roll and jingling of bells made themselves heard above the  wind, and a street-car came laboring down the street through the heavy  drifts. Mr. Broadstreet, without a thought as to the destination of  the car, but impelled by some unseen force, clambered upon the rear  platform. The conductor was standing like a snowman, covered with  white from head to foot, collar up around his ears, and hands deep in  his pockets. And the Shadow was there again. Broad and gloomy, it  surrounded both conductor and passenger in its bleak folds.    \"Tough night, sir,\" remarked the former, presently.    \"Yes, yes, it is, indeed,\" replied Mr. Broadstreet, who was thinking  what in the world he could give this man, except money. \"And Christmas  Eve, too!\"    \"That's a fact,\" said the conductor. \"Just the luck of it, I say. Now  to-morrow I get four hours lay-off in the afternoon, and my wife, she  was planning to take the children and go to the play. But they're none  of 'em over strong, and 't won't do to take 'em out in this snow.  Besides, like's not 'twill storm all day.\"    \"Children?\" exclaimed Mr. Broadstreet, seeing a way out of his  difficulty; \"how many?\"    \"Two girls and a boy, all under seven.\"    \"Got any Christmas presents for them?--don't mind my asking.\"    \"Well, I'd just 's lief show you what I _have_ got. 'T ain't much, you  know, but then it's _somethin'_.\"    He stepped inside the door, laid aside his snowy mittens, and taking  from the corner of the seat a small brown parcel, carefully removed  the string and wrappings.    \"There,\" he said, with a sort of pleading pride in his eyes, \"I guess  these'll please 'em some. 'Taint much, you know,\" he added again,  glancing at his passenger's fur cap, as he displayed the presents on  the car-seat.    A very red-cheeked and blue-eyed doll, with a placid countenance quite  out of keeping with her arms; these members being so constructed as to  occupy only two positions, one of which expressed unbounded  astonishment, and the other gloomy resignation; a transparent slate,  with a dim cow under the glass, and \"fifteen cents,\" plainly marked in  lead pencil on one corner of the frame, and a rattle for the girl  baby.    As the conductor held up these articles in his stiff, red fingers,  turning the doll about so as to show her flaxen braid to the best  advantage, and inducing the arms to take the positions alluded to, the  Shadow crept away, and had well-nigh disappeared. But it returned  again, thicker than ever, when he said, with a little choke in his  voice, \"I did mean to get 'em a little tree, with candles on it, and a  picture-book or two; but our pay ain't overmuch, and we had sickness,  and--and\"--he was very busy doing up the bundle, and very clumsy he  must have been, too, for it was a long time before the wide-looped,  single bow-knot was tied, and the parcel carefully put away again.    Mr. Broadstreet winked hard, and his eyes shone.    \"How long before you pass here on the way back?\" he asked.    \"About thirty-five minutes it'll take us to get round, sir, on account  of the snow. It's my last trip.\"    \"Very well. Now, conductor--ahem! what did you say your name was?\"    \"Tryson, sir; David Tryson.\"    \"Then, ahem! Mr. Tryson--just ring your bell when you reach the corner  there, on the up trip; and dodge into that store where the lights  are. You'll find a bundle waiting for you. Good-night conduct--Mr.  Tryson, and a Merry Christmas to you and yours!\"    \"Good-night, sir! God bless you, sir! Merry\"--but his passenger was  gone.    As he reached the sidewalk, Mr. Broadstreet turned and looked after  the car. Whether it was the light from the street lamp, or the broad  flood of radiance that poured out from the windows of the toy-shop  just beyond, he could not tell; but the rear platform was illuminated  by a pure, steady glow, in the very center of which stood the  conductor, smiling and waving his hand. No sign of a Shadow; not a bit  of it. Mr. Broadstreet looked carefully about him, but it was nowhere  to be seen. Even the snow, which all this time continued to fall  without interruption, seemed to fill the air with tiny lamps of soft  light.    Ah, that toy-shop! Such heaps of blocks, and marbles, and sleds; such  dolls with eyes that would wink upside down, exactly like a hen's;  such troops of horses and caravans of teams; such jangling of toy  pianos, and tooting of toy horns, and shrieking of toy whistles,  (these instruments being anxiously tested by portly papas and mammas,  apparently to be sure of a good bargain, but really for the fun of the  thing); such crowds of good-natured people, carrying canes, and drums,  and hoop-sticks under their arms, taking and giving thrusts of these  articles and being constantly pushed and pulled and jammed and trodden  upon with the most delightful good humor; such rows of pretty girls  behind the counters, now climbing to the summits of Ararats where  innumerable Noah's Arks, of all sizes, had been stranded; all these  girls being completely used up with the day's work, of course, but  more cheerful and willing than ever, bless them! such scamperings to  and fro of cash-boys, and diving into the crowd, and emergings in  utterly unexpected places--were never seen before in this quiet old  city.    Mr. Broadstreet embarked on the current, and with an unconsciously  benevolent smile on his round face was borne half-way down the store  before he could make fast to a counter.    \"What can I do for you, sir?\" If the girlish voice was brisk and  businesslike it was at the same time undeniably pleasant.    Mr. Broadstreet started. \"Why, I want some presents; Christmas  presents, you know,\" he said, looking down into the merry brown eyes.    \"Boy or girl, sir, and how old?\"    Mr. Broadstreet was fairly taken aback by her promptness. His wife  always did the Christmas shopping.    \"Let me see,\" he began hurriedly; \"two girls and a--no, I mean two  boys--why, bless me,\" he went on in great confusion, as her low laugh  rang out among the woolly sheep with which she happened to be  surrounded, \"I've really forgotten. That is--Oh, I see; you needn't  laugh,\" and Mr. Broadstreet's own smile broadened as he spoke,  \"they're not mine. I never heard of them until five minutes ago, and  I declare I don't remember which is which. At any rate there are three  of them, all under seven.\"    \"How would a lamb do for the oldest? Real wool and natural motion?\" in  proof of which latter assertion she set all their heads nodding in the  most violent manner, until it made her customers quite dizzy to look  at them. Mr. Broadstreet picked out the biggest one. \"He seems  to--ah--bow more vigorously than the rest,\" he said.    The girl then proceeded to display various toys and gay-colored  picture-books, Mr. Broadstreet assenting to the choice in every  instance, until a large, compact bundle lay on the counter, plainly  marked,            \"_Mr. Tryson, Conductor. To be called for._\"    As the lawyer was leaving the store, he remembered something, and  turned back.    \"I forgot,\" he said, \"I wanted to buy a tree\"--    \"Just round the corner,\" interrupted the brown-eyed girl over her  shoulder, without looking at him. She was already deep in the  confidence of the next customer, who had told her the early history of  two of her children, and was now proceeding to the third. Mr.  Broadstreet buttoned up his coat collar, and stepped out once more  into the storm. A few moments' walk brought him to a stand where the  trees were for sale. And what a spicy, fragrant, delicious, jolly  place it was, to be sure! The sidewalk was flanked right and left with  rows upon rows of spruce, pine and fir trees, all gayly decked with  tufts of snow; every doorway, too, was full of these trees, as if they  had huddled in there to get out of the storm. Here and there were  great boxes overflowing with evergreen and holly boughs, many of which  the dealers had taken out and stuck into all sorts of crannies and  corners of their stands, so that the glossy leaves and scarlet berries  glistened in the flaring light of the lamps. Wreaths of every size and  description--some made of crispy gray moss, dotted with bright  amaranths, some of holly--were threaded upon sticks like beads, and  were being constantly pulled off and sold to the muffled customers who  poured through the narrow passageway in a continuous stream.    \"All brightness,\" thought Mr. Broadstreet, \"and no Shadow this time.\"    None? What was that black ugly-looking stain on the fallen snow,  extending from his own feet to one of the rude wooden stands where  traffic was busiest? Mr. Broadstreet started, and scrutinized it  sharply. He soon discovered the outline of Christmas Present. Beyond a  doubt it was the Shadow again.      III    It must be confessed that for a moment Mr. Broadstreet felt slightly  annoyed. Why should that Thing be constantly starting up and darkening  his cheerful mood? It was bad enough that the Shadow should exist,  without intruding its melancholy length upon people who were enjoying  Christmas Eve. He might have indulged in still further discontent,  when he noticed the head of the Shadow-figure droop as in sadness. He  remembered the kind Ghost's grief, and upbraided himself for his  hardness of heart.    \"Forgive me,\" he said, half aloud. \"I was wrong. I forgot. I will,  please God, brighten this spot and turn away the Shadow!\"    Without further delay he advanced through the gloomy space until he  reached the box, upon which a large lot of holly wreaths and crosses  were displayed. He soon completed the purchase of a fine thick fir,  and sent it, together with a roll of evergreens, to the toy-shop,  directed like the parcel to the conductor.    The owner of the stand was a jovial, bright-faced"]]]
