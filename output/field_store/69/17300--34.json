This way, Koku!\" he called to the giant.    \"Say, is--is he real, or am I seeing things?\" asked the aviator,  as he looked at the big man.    \"Oh, he's real, all right,\" laughed Tom. \"Now, then, I'm going to  shut off your motor, and then you can quit hugging that chimney,  and come down.\"    \"I'll be real glad to,\" said the birdman.    Making his way cautiously along the gutters of the roof, Tom  managed to reach the motor controls. He pulled out the electrical  switch, and with a sort of cough and groan the motor stopped. The  big propellers ceased revolving, and the aviator could leave his  perch in safety.    This he did, edging along until he could climb down and meet Tom,  who stood near the ladder.    \"Much obliged,\" said the birdman, as he shook hands with Tom. \"My  name is Grant Halling. I'm a newcomer in Mansburg,\" he added,  naming a town not far from Shopton. \"I know you by reputation, so  you don't need to introduce yourself.\"    \"Glad to meet you,\" said the young inventor, cordially. \"Rather a  queer place to meet a friend,\" he went on with a laugh and a  glance down to the ground. \"Can you climb?\"    \"Oh, yes, I'm used to that. The next thing will be to get my  machine down.\"    \"Oh, we can manage that with Koku's help,\" spoke Tom. \"Koku, get  some ropes, and see what you and Rad can do toward getting the  aeroplane down,\" he added to the giant. \"Let me know if you need  any help.\"    \"Me can do!\" exclaimed the big man. \"Me fix him!\"    Tom and Mr. Halling made their way down the ladder, while the  giant proceeded to study out a plan for getting the airship off  the roof.    \"You say you were coming over to see me, when you ran into my  wireless aerials?\" asked Tom, curiously, when he had introduced  his father to the birdman.    \"Yes,\" went on Mr. Halling. \"I have been having some trouble with  my motor, and I thought perhaps you could tell me what was wrong.  My friend, Mr. Wakefield Damon, sent me to you.\"    \"What! Do you know Mr. Damon?\" cried Tom.    \"I've known' him for some years. I met him in the West, but I  hadn't seen him lately, until I came East. He sent me to see you,  and said you would help me.\"    \"Well, any friend of Mr. Damon's is a friend of mine!\" exclaimed  Tom, genially. \"I'll have a look at your machine as soon as Koku  gets it down. How is Mr. Damon, anyhow? I haven't seen him in over  two weeks.\"    \"I'm sorry to say he isn't very well, Mr. Swift.\"    \"Is he ill? What is the trouble?\"    \"He isn't exactly ill,\" went on Mr. Halling, \"but he is fretting  himself into a sickness, worrying over his lost fortune.\"    \"His lost fortune!\" cried Tom, in surprise at the bad news  concerning his friend. \"I didn't know he had lost his money!\"    \"He hasn't yet, but he's in a fair way to, he says. It's something  about bad investments, and he did speak of the trickery of one  man, I didn't get the particulars. But he certainly feels very  badly over it.\"    \"I should think he would,\" put in Mr. Swift. \"Tom, we must look  into this. If we can help Mr. Damon--\"    \"We certainly will,\" interrupted Tom. \"Now come in the house, Mr.  Halling. I'm sure you must be quite shaken up by your upset.\"    \"I am, to tell you the truth, though it isn't the first accident  I've had in my airship.\"    They were proceeding toward the house, when there came a cry from  Koku, who had fastened a rope about the airship to lower it.    \"Master! Master!\" cried the giant. \"The rope am slippin'. Grab the  end of it!\"            CHAPTER III    TOM'S FAILURE      \"Come on!\" cried Tom, quickly, as, turning, he saw the accident  about to happen. \"Your craft will surely be smashed if she slips  to the ground, Mr. Halling!\"    \"You're right! This seems to be my unlucky day!\" The birdman,  limping slightly from his fall, hurried with Tom to where a rope  trailed on the ground. Koku had fastened one end to the airship,  and had taken a turn of the cable about the chimney. He had been  lowering the biplane to the ground, but he had not allowed for its  great weight, and the rope had slipped from his big hands.    But Tom and Mr. Halling were just in time. They grabbed the  slipping hempen strands, and thus checked the falling craft until  Koku could get a better grip.    \"All right now,\" said the giant, when he had made fast the rope.  \"Me fix now. Master can go.\"    \"Think he can lower it?\" asked Mr. Halling, doubtfully.    \"Oh, surely,\" said Tom. \"Koku's as strong as a horse. You needn't  worry. He'll get it down all right. But you are limping.\"    \"Yes, I jammed my leg a little.\"    \"Don't you want a doctor?\"    \"Oh, no, not for a little thing like that.\"    But Tom insisted on looking at his new friend's wound, and found  quite a cut on the thigh, which the young inventor insisted on  binding up.    \"That feels better,\" said the birdman, as he stretched out on a  couch. \"Now if you can look my machine over, and tell me what's  the matter with it, I'll be much obliged to you, and I'll get on  my way.\"    \"Not quite so fast as that!\" laughed Tom. \"I wouldn't want to see  you start off with your lame leg, and certainly I would not want  to see you use your aircraft after what she's gone through, until  we've given her a test. You can't tell what part you might have  strained.\"    \"Well, I suppose you are right. But I think I'd better go to a  hotel, or send for an auto and go home.\"    \"Now you needn't do anything of the kind,\" spoke Tom, hospitably.  \"We've got lots of room here, and for that matter we have plenty  of autos and airships, too, as well as a motor boat. You just rest  yourself here. Later we'll look over your craft.\"    After dinner, when Mr. Halling said he felt much better, Tom  agreed to go out with him and look at the airship. As he feared,  he found several things the matter with it, in addition to the  motor trouble which had been the cause for Mr. Halling's call on  the young inventor.    \"Can she be fixed?\" asked the birdman, who explained that, as yet,  he was only an amateur in the practice of flying.    \"Oh, yes, we can fix her up for you,\" said Tom. \"But it will take  several days. You'll have to leave it here.\"    \"Well, I'll be glad to do that, for I know she will be all the  better when you get through with her. But I think I am able to go  on home now, and I really ought to. There is some business I must  attend to.\"    \"Speaking of business,\" remarked Tom, \"can you tell me anything  more of Mr. Damon's financial troubles?\"    \"No, not much. All I know is that when I called on him the other  day I found him with his check book out, and he was doing a lot of  figuring. He looked pretty blue and downcast, I can tell you.\"    \"I'm sorry about that,\" spoke Tom, musingly. \"Mr. Damon is a very  good friend of mine, and I'd do anything to help him. I certainly  wouldn't like to see him lose his fortune. Bad investments, you  say it was?\"    \"Partly so, and yet I'm inclined to think if he does lose his  money it will be due to some trickery. Mr. Damon is not the man to  make bad investments by himself.\"    \"Indeed he is not,\" agreed Tom. \"You say he spoke of some man?\"    \"Yes, but not definitely. He did not mention any name. But Mr.  Damon was certainly quite blue.\"    \"That's unlike him,\" remarked Tom. \"He is usually very jolly. He  must be feeling quite badly. I'll go over and have a talk with  him, as soon as I can.\"    \"Do. I think he would appreciate it. And now I must see about  getting home.\"    \"I'll take you in one of my cars,\" said Tom, who had several  automobiles. \"I don't want to see you strain that injured leg of  yours.\"    \"You're very good--especially after I tangled up your wireless  aerials; but I didn't see them until I was right into them,\"  apologized Mr. Halling.    \"They're a new kind of wire,\" said Tom, \"and are not very plain to  see. I must put up some warning signs. But don't worry about  damaging them. They were only up temporarily anyhow, and I was  going to take them down to arrange for my photo telephone.\"    \"Photo telephone, eh? Is that something new?\"    \"It will be--if I can get it working,\" said Tom, with a smile.    A little later Tom had taken Mr. Halling home, and then he set  about making arrangements for repairing the damaged airship. This  took him the better part of a week, but he did not regret the  time, for while he was working he was busy making plans for his  newest invention--the photo telephone.    One afternoon, when Tom had completed the repairs to the airship,  and had spent some time setting up an experimental telephone line,  the young inventor received a call from his chum, Ned Newton.    \"Well, well, what are you up to now?\" asked Ned, as he saw his  chum seated in a booth, with a telephone receiver to his ear,  meanwhile looking steadily at a polished metal plate in front of  him. \"Trying to hypnotize yourself, Tom?\"    \"Not exactly. Quiet, Ned, please. I'm trying to listen.\"    Ned was too familiar with his chum's work to take offense at this.  The young banker took a seat on a box, and silently watched Tom.  The inventor shifted several switches, pressed one button after  another, and tilted the polished metal plate at different angles.  Then he closed the door of the little telephone booth, and Ned,  through the ground glass door, saw a light shining.    \"I wonder what new game Tom is up to?\" Ned mused.    Presently the door opened, and Tom stuck out his head.    \"Ned, come here,\" he invited. \"Look at that metal plate and see if  you can notice anything on it. I've been staring at it so steadily  that my eyes are full of sticks. See what you can make out.\"    \"What is this?\" asked Ned. \"No trick; is it? I won't be blown up,  or get my eyes full of pepper; will I?\"    \"Nonsense! Of course not. I'm trying to make a photo telephone. I  have the telephone part down pat, but I can't see anything of the  photo image. See if you can.\"    Ned stared at the polished plate, while"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4544"],[0,"The Cell of Self-Knowledge : seven early English mystical treatises printed (#3)"],[1,"Walter Hilton, as  likewise to William Exmew, or to Maurice Chauncy, Carthusians of the  sixteenth century, whereas the manuscripts are at least a hundred  years earlier than their time; but it seems safer to attribute the  whole series to an unknown writer of the second part of the  fourteenth century, who \"marks a middle point between Rolle and  Hilton.\"[21] The spiritual beauty of the three here reprinted--and,  more particularly, of the Epistle of Prayer, with its glowing  exposition of the doctrine of Pure Love--speaks for itself. They  show us mysticism brought down, if I may say so, from the clouds for  the practical guidance of the beginner along this difficult way.  And, in the Epistle of Discretion, we find even a rare touch of  humour; where the counsellor \"conceives suspiciously\" of his  correspondent's spiritual stirrings, lest \"they should be conceived  on the ape's manner.\" Like St. Catherine of Siena, though in a less  degree, he has the gift of vision and the faculty of intuition  combined with a homely common sense, and can illustrate his \"simple  meaning\" with a smile.    I have borrowed a phrase from St. Catherine, \"The Cell of  Self-Knowledge,\" la cella del cognoscimento di noi, as the title of  this little volume. Knowledge of self and purity of heart, the  mystics teach, are the indispensable conditions for the highest  mystical elevation. Knowledge of self, for Richard of St. Victor, is  the high mountain apart upon which Christ is transfigured; for  Catherine of Siena, it is the stable in which the pilgrim through  time to eternity must be born again. \"Wouldest thou behold Christ  transfigured?\" asks Richard; \"ascend this mountain; learn to know  thyself.\"[22] \"Thou dost see,\" writes Catherine, speaking in the  person of the eternal Father, \"this sweet and loving Word born in a  stable, while Mary was journeying; to show to you, who are  travellers, that you must ever be born again in the stable of  knowledge of yourselves, where you will find Him born by grace  within your souls.\"[23] The soul is a mirror that reflects the  invisible things of God, and it is by purity of heart alone that  this mirror is made clear. \"Therefore,\" writes Richard of St.  Victor, \"let whoso thirsts to see his God, wipe his mirror, purify  his spirit. After he hath thus cleared his mirror and long  diligently gazed into it, a certain clarity of divine light begins  to shine through upon him, and a certain immense ray of unwonted  vision to appear before his eyes. This light irradiated the eyes of  him who said: Lord, lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon  us; Thou hast put gladness in my heart. From the vision of this  light which it sees with wonder in itself, the mind is wondrously  inflamed and inspired to behold the light which is above  itself.\"[24]    Pepwell's volume has been made the basis of the present edition of  these seven treatises; but, in each case, the text has been  completely revised. The text of the Benjamin, the Epistle of Prayer,  the Epistle of Discretion, and the Treatise of Discerning of  Spirits, has been collated with that given by the Harleian MSS. 674  and 2373; and, in most cases, the readings of the manuscripts have  been adopted in preference to those of the printed version. The  Katherin has been collated with Caxton's Lyf; the Margery Kempe with  Wynkyn de Worde's precious little volume in the University Library  of Cambridge; and the Song of Angels with the text published by  Professor Horstman from the Camb. MS Dd. v. 55. As the object of  this book is not to offer a Middle English text to students, but a  small contribution to mystical literature, the orthography has been  completely modernised, while I have attempted to retain enough of  the original language to preserve the flavour of mediaeval devotion.    EDMUND G. GARDNER.          I.    HERE FOLLOWETH A VERY DEVOUT TREATISE, NAMED BENJAMIN, OF THE MIGHTS  AND VIRTUES OF MAN'S SOUL, AND OF THE WAY TO TRUE CONTEMPLATION,  COMPILED BY A NOBLE AND FAMOUS DOCTOR, A MAN OF GREAT HOLINESS AND  DEVOTION, NAMED RICHARD OF SAINT VICTOR    A TREATISE NAMED BENJAMIN    THE PROLOGUE      A GREAT clerk that men call [25] Richard of Saint Victor, in a book  that he maketh of the study of wisdom, witnesseth and saith that two  mights are in a man's soul, given of the Father of Heaven of whom  all good cometh. The one is reason, the other is affection; through  reason we know, and through affection we feel or love.    Of reason springeth right counsel and ghostly wits; and of affection  springeth holy desires and ordained[26] feelings. And right as  Rachel and Leah were both wives unto Jacob, right so man's soul  through light of knowing in the reason, and sweetness of love in the  affection, is spoused unto God. By Jacob is understanden God, by  Rachel is understanden reason, by Leah is understanden affection.  Each of these wives, Rachel and Leah, took to them a maiden; Rachel  took Bilhah, and Leah took Zilpah. Bilhah was a great jangler, and  Zilpah was ever drunken and thirsty. By Bilhah is understanden  imagination, the which is servant unto reason, as Bilhah was to  Rachel; by Zilpah is understanden sensuality, the which is servant  unto affection, as Zilpah was to Leah. And so much are these maidens  needful to their ladies, that without them all this world might  serve them of nought. For why, without imagination reason may not  know, and without sensuality affection may not feel. And yet  imagination cryeth so inconveniently[27] in the ears of our heart  that, for ought that reason her lady may do, yet she may not still  her. And therefore it is that oft times when we should pray, so many  divers fantasies of idle and evil thoughts cry in our hearts, that  on no wise we may by our own mights drive them away. And thus it is  well proved that Bilhah is a foul jangler. And also the sensuality  is evermore so thirsty, that all that affection her lady may  feel,[28] may not yet slake her thirst. The drink that she desireth  is the lust of fleshly, kindly, and worldly delights,[29] of the  which the more that she drinketh the more she thirsteth; for why,  for to fill the appetite of the sensuality, all this world may not  suffice; and therefore it is that oft times when we pray or think on  God and ghostly things, we would fain feel sweetness of love in our  affection,[30] and yet we may not, for are we so busy to feed the  concupiscence of our sensuality; for evermore it is greedily asking,  and we have a fleshly compassion thereof. And thus it is well proved  that Zilpah is evermore drunken and thirsty. And right as Leah  conceived of Jacob and brought forth seven children, and Rachel  conceived of Jacob and brought forth two children, and Bilhah  conceived of Jacob and brought forth two children, and Zilpah  conceived of Jacob and brought forth two children; right so the  affection conceiveth through the grace of God, and bringeth forth  seven virtues; and also the sensuality conceiveth through the grace  of God, and bringeth forth two virtues; and also the reason  conceiveth through the grace of God, and bringeth forth two virtues;  and also the imagination conceiveth through the grace of God, and  bringeth forth two virtues, or two beholdings. And the names of  their children and of their virtues shall be known by this figure  that followeth:    Husband: Jacob temporally, God spiritually. Wives to Jacob: Leah,  that is to say, Affection; Rachel, that is to say, Reason. Maid to  Leah is Zilpah, that is to understand, Sensuality; and Bilhah maiden  to Rachel, that is to understand, Imagination.    The sons of Jacob and Leah are these seven that followeth: Reuben  signifieth dread of pain; Simeon, sorrow of sins; Levi, hope of  forgiveness; Judah, love of righteousness; Issachar, joy in inward  sweetness; Zebulun, hatred of sin; Dinah, ordained shame.    The sons of Jacob and Zilpah, servant of Leah, are these: Gad,  abstinence; Asher, patience.    The sons of Jacob and of Rachel are these: Joseph, discretion;  Benjamin, contemplation.    The sons of Jacob and Bilhah, servant to Rachel, are these: Dan,  sight of pain to come; and Naphtali, sight of joy to come.    In this figure it is shewed apertly of Jacob and of his wives, and  their maidens, and all their children. Here it is to shew on what  manner they were gotten, and in what order:--    First, it is to say of the children of Leah; for why, it is read  that she first conceived. The children of Leah are nought else to  understand but ordained affections or feelings in a man's soul; for  why, if they were unordained, then were they not the sons of Jacob.  Also the seven children of Leah are seven virtues, for virtue is  nought else but an ordained and a measured feeling in a man's soul.  For then is man's feeling in soul ordained when it is of that thing  that it should be; then it is measured when it is so much as it  should be. These feelings in a man's soul may be now ordained and  measured, and now unordained and unmeasured; but when they are  ordained and measured, then are they accounted among the sons of  Jacob.[31]          CAPITULUM I    HOW THE VIRTUE OF DREAD RISETH IN THE AFFECTION      THE first child that Leah conceived of Jacob was Reuben, that is,  dread; and therefore it is written in the psalm: \"The beginning of  wisdom is the dread of our Lord God.\"[32] This is the first felt  virtue in a man's affection, without the which none other may be  had. And, therefore, whoso desireth to have such a son, him behoveth  busily and oft also behold the evil that he hath done. And he shall,  on the one party, think on the greatness of his trespass, and, on  another party, the power of the Doomsman.[33] Of such a  consideration springeth dread, that is to say Reuben, that through  right is cleped \"the son of sight.\"[34] For utterly is he blind that  seeth not the pains that are to come, and dreadeth not to sin. And  well is Reuben cleped the son of"]]]
