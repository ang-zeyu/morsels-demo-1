Yea, verily, and even God cannot come  there with a form; He can only come with His simple divine nature.\"  And in the startling passage often quoted against him, a passage  which illustrates admirably his affinity to one side of Hegelianism,  we read: \"The eye with which I see God is the same eye with which He  sees me. Mine eye and God's eye are one eye and one sight and one  knowledge and one love.\"    I do not defend these passages as orthodox; but before exclaiming  \"rank Pantheism!\" we ought to recollect that for Eckhart the being  of God is quite different from His personality. Eckhart never taught  that the Persons of the Holy Trinity become, after the mystical  Union, the \"Form\" of the human soul. It is the impersonal light of  the divine nature which transforms our nature; human personality is  neither lost nor converted into divine personality. Moreover, the  divine spark at the centre of the soul is not the soul nor the  personality. \"The soul,\" he says in one place, using a figure which  recurs in the \"Theologia Germanica,\" \"has two faces. One is turned  towards this world and towards the body, the other towards God.\" The  complete dominion of the \"spark\" over the soul is an unrealised  ideal.[14]    The truth which he values is that, as Mr Upton[15] has well  expressed it, \"there is a certain self-revelation of the eternal and  infinite One to the finite soul, and therefore an indestructible  basis for religious ideas and beliefs as distinguished from what is  called scientific knowledge. . . . This immanent universal principle  does not pertain to, and is not the property of any individual mind,  but belongs to that uncreated and eternal nature of God which lies  deeper than all those differences which separate individual minds  from each other, and is indeed that incarnation of the Eternal, who  though He is present in every finite thing, is still not broken up  into individualities, but remains one and the same eternal  substance, one and the same unifying principle, immanently and  indivisibly present in every one of the countless plurality of  finite individuals.\" It might further be urged that neither God nor  man can be understood in independence of each other. A recent writer  on ethics,[16] not too well disposed towards Christianity, is, I  think, right in saying: \"To the popular mind, which assumes God and  man to be two different realities, each given in independence of the  other, . . . the identification of man's love of God with God's love  of Himself has always been a paradox and a stumbling-block. But it  is not too much to say that until it has been seen to be no paradox,  but a simple and fundamental truth, the masterpieces of the world's  religious literature must remain a sealed book to us.\"    Eckhart certainly believed himself to have escaped the pitfall of  Pantheism; but he often expressed himself in such an unguarded way  that the charge may be brought against him with some show of reason.    Love, Eckhart teaches, is the principle of all virtues; it is God  Himself. Next to it in dignity comes humility. The beauty of the  soul, he says in the true Platonic vein, is to be well ordered, with  the higher faculties above the lower, each in its proper place. The  will should be supreme over the understanding, the understanding  over the senses. Whatever we will earnestly, that we have, and no  one can hinder us from attaining that detachment from the creatures  in which our blessedness consists.    Evil, from the highest standpoint, is only a means for realising the  eternal aim of God in creation; all will ultimately be overruled for  good. Nevertheless, we can frustrate the good will of God towards  us, and it is this, and not the thought of any insult against  Himself, that makes God grieve for our sins. It would not be worth  while to give any more quotations on this subject, for Eckhart is  not more successful than other philosophers in propounding a  consistent and intelligible theory of the place of evil in the  universe.    Eckhart is well aware of the two chief pitfalls into which the  mystic is liable to fall--dreamy inactivity and Antinomianism. The  sects of the Free Spirit seem to have afforded a good object-lesson  in both these errors, as some of the Gnostic sects did in the second  century. Eckhart's teaching here is sound and good. Freedom from  law, he says, belongs only to the \"spark,\" not to the faculties of  the soul, and no man can live always on the highest plane.  Contemplation is, in a sense, a means to activity; works of charity  are its proper fruit. \"If a man were in an ecstasy like that of St  Paul, when he was caught up into the third heaven, and knew of a  poor man who needed his help, he ought to leave his ecstasy and help  the needy.\" Suso[17] tells us how God punished him for disregarding  this duty. True contemplation considers Reality (or Being) in its  manifestations as well as in its origin. If this is remembered,  there need be no conflict between social morality and the inner  life. Eckhart recognises[18] that it is a harder and a nobler task  to preserve detachment in a crowd than in a cell; the little daily  sacrifices of family life are often a greater trial than  self-imposed mortifications. \"We need not destroy any little good in  ourselves for the sake of a better, but we should strive to grasp  every truth in its highest meaning, for no one good contradicts  another.\" \"Love God, and do as you like, say the Free Spirits. Yes;  but as long as you like anything contrary to God's will, you do not  love Him.\"    There is much more of the same kind in Eckhart's sermons--as good  and sensible doctrine as one could find anywhere. But what was the  practical effect of his teaching as a whole? It is generally the  case that the really weak points of any religious movement are  exposed with a cruel logicality most exasperating to the leaders by  the second generation of its adherents. The dangerous side of the  Eckhartian mysticism is painfully exhibited in the life of his  spiritual daughter, \"Schwester Katrei,\" the saint of the later  Beguines. Katrei is a rather shadowy person; but for our present  purpose it does not much matter whether the story of her life has  been embroidered or not. Her memory was revered for such sayings and  doings as these which follow. On one occasion she exclaimed:  \"Congratulate me; I have become God!\" and on another she declared  that \"not even the desire of heaven should tempt a good man towards  activity.\" It was her ambition to forget who were her parents, to be  indifferent whether she received absolution and partook of the Holy  Communion or not; and she finally realised her ambition by falling  into a cataleptic state in which she was supposed to be dead, and  was carried out for burial. Her confessor, perceiving that she was  not really dead, awoke her: \"Art thou satisfied?\" \"I am satisfied at  last,\" said Katrei: she was now \"dead all through,\" as she wished to  be.    Are we to conclude that the logical outcome of mysticism is this  strange reproduction, in Teutonic Europe, of Indian Yogism? Many who  have studied the subject have satisfied themselves that Schwester  Katrei is the truly consistent mystic. They have come to the  conclusion that the real attraction of mysticism is a pining for  deliverance from this fretful, anxious, exacting, individual life,  and a yearning for absorption into the great Abyss where all  distinctions are merged in the Infinite. According to this view,  mysticism in its purest form should be studied in the ancient  religious literature of India, which teaches us how all this world  of colour and diversity, of sharp outlines and conflicting forces,  may be lost and swallowed up in the \"white radiance,\" or black  darkness (it does not really matter which we call it) of an empty  Infinite.    The present writer is convinced that this is not the truth about  mysticism. Eckhart may have encouraged Schwester Katrei in her  attempt to substitute the living death of the blank trance for the  dying life of Christian charity; but none the less she caricatured  and stultified his teaching. And I think it is possible to lay our  finger on the place where she and so many others went wrong. The  aspiration of mysticism is to find the unity which underlies all  diversity, or, in religious language, to see God face to face. From  the Many to the One is always the path of the mystic. Plotinus, the  father of all mystical philosophy in Europe (unless, as he himself  would have wished, we give that honour to Plato), mapped out the  upward road as follows:--At the bottom of the hill is the sphere of  the \"merely many\"--of material objects viewed in disconnection,  dull, and spiritless. This is a world which has no real existence;  it may best be called \"not-being\" (\"ein lauteres Nichts,\" as Eckhart  says), and as the indeterminate, it can only be apprehended by a  corresponding indeterminateness in the soul. The soul, however,  always adds some form and determination to the abstract formlessness  of the \"merely many.\" Next, we rise to, or project for ourselves,  the world of \"the one and the many.\" This is the sphere in which our  consciousness normally moves. We are conscious of an overruling  Mind, but the creatures still seem external"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4667"],[0,"Seven Wives and Seven Prisons (#3)"],[1,"before a justice on charge of seduction. The trial was brief; the  daughter herself swore positively, that though she had been imprudent  and indiscreet in going to Worcester with me, no improper communication  had ever, there or elsewhere, taken place between us.    Of course, there was nothing to do but to let me go and I was  discharged. But out of this affair came the worst that had yet fallen  to my lot in life. The story got into the papers, with particulars and  names of the parties, and in this way the people at Worthington, who had  chased me as far as Hancock and had there lost all trace of me, found  out where I was. If I had been aware of it, they might have looked  elsewhere for me; but while I was felicitating myself upon my escape  from the latest difficulty, down came an officer from Worthington with a  warrant for my arrest. This officer, the sheriff, was connected with the  family into which I had married in Worthington, and with him came two or  three more relatives, all bound, as they boasted, to \"put me through.\"  They were excessively irate against me and very much angered, especially  that their race after me to Hancock had been fruitless. I had fallen  into the worst possible hands.    They took me to Northampton and brought me before a Justice, on a  charge of bigamy: The sheriff who arrested me, and the relatives who  accompanied him were willing to swear my life away, if they could, and  the justice was ready enough to bind me over to take my trial in court,  which was not to be in session for full six months to come. Those long,  weary six months I passed in the county jail. Then came my trial. I had  good counsel. There was not a particle of proof that I was guilty of  bigamy; no attempt was made on the part of the prosecution to produce  my first wife, from whom I had separated, or, indeed, to show that there  was such a woman in existence. But, evidence or no evidence, with all  Worthington against me, conviction was inevitable. The jury found me  guilty. The judge promptly sentenced me to three years' imprisonment in  the State Prison, at Charlestown, with hard labor, the first day to be  passed in solitary confinement.    This severe sentence fairly stunned me. I was taken back to jail, and  the following day I was conveyed to Charlestown with heavy irons on my  ankles and handcuffed. No murderer would have been more heavily ironed.  We started early in the morning, and by noon I was duly delivered to  the warden at Charlestown prison. I was taken into the office, measured,  asked my name, age, and other particulars, and then if I had a trade. To  this I at once answered, \"no.\" I wanted my twenty-four hours'  solitary confinement in which to reflect upon the kind of \"hard labor,\"  prescribed in my sentence, I was willing to follow for the next three  years; and I also wanted information about the branches of labor pursued  in that prison. The next words of the warden assured me that he was a  kind and compassionate man.    \"Go,\" he said to an officer, \"and instantly take off those irons when  you take him inside the prison.\"    I was taken in and the irons were taken off. I was then undressed, my  clothes were removed to another room, and I was redressed in the prison  uniform. This was a grotesque uniform indeed. The suit was red and blue,  half and half, like a harlequin's, and to crown all came a hat or cap,  like a fool's cap, a foot and a half high and running up to a peak.  Miserable as I was, I could scarcely help smiling at the utterly absurd  appearance I knew I then presented. I even ventured to remark upon it;  but was suddenly and sternly checked with the command:    \"Silence! There's no talking allowed here.\"    Then began my twenty-four hours' solitary confinement, and twenty-four  wretched hours they were. I had only bread and water to eat and drink,  and I need not say that my unhappy thoughts would not permit me to  sleep. At noon next day I was taken from my cell, and brought again  before the warden, Mr. Robinson, who kindly said:    \"You have no trade, you say; what do you want to go to work at?\"    \"Anything light; I am not used to hard labor,\" I replied.    So the warden directed that I should be put at work in the brush shop,  where all kinds of brushes were made. Mr. Eddy was the officer in charge  of this shop, and Mr. Knowles, the contractor for the labor employed in  the brush business, was present. Both of these gentlemen took pains to  instruct me in the work I was to begin upon, and were very kind in their  manner towards me. I went to work in a bungling way and with a sad and  heavy heart. At 12 o'clock we were marched from the shop to our  cells, each man taking from a trap in the wall, as he went by, his pan  containing his dinner, which consisted, that day, of boiled beef and  potatoes. It was probably the worst dinner I had ever eaten, but I had  yet to learn what prison fare was. From one o'clock to six I was in the  shop again; then came Supper--mush and molasses that evening which was  varied, as I learned afterwards, on different days by rye bread,  or Indian bread and rye coffee. These things were also served for  breakfast, and the dinners were varied on different days in the week.  The fare was very coarse, always, but abundant and wholesome. After  supper prisoners were expected to go to bed, as they were called out at  six o'clock in the morning.    I stayed in the brush shop three or four months, but I made very little  progress in learning the trade. I was willing enough to learn and did my  best. From the day I entered the prison I made up my mind to behave as  well as I could; to be docile and obedient, and to comply with every  rule and order. Consequently I had no trouble, and the officers all  treated me kindly. Warden Robinson was a model man for his position. He  believed that prisoners could be reformed more easily by mild than by  harsh measures--at least they would be more contented with their lot and  would be subordinate. Every now and then he would ask prisoners if they  were well treated by the officers; how they were getting on; if they had  enough to eat, and so on. The officers seemed imbued with the warden's  spirit; the chaplain of the prison, who conducted the Sunday, services  and also held a Sunday school, was one of the finest men in the world,  and took a personal interest in every prisoner. Altogether, it was  a model institution. But in spite of good treatment I was intensely  miserable; my mind was morbid; I was nearly, if not quite, insane; and  one day during the dinner hour, I opened a vein in each arm in hopes  that I should bleed to death. Bleed I did, till I fainted away, and as  I did not come out when the other prisoners did, the officer came to  my cell and discovered my condition. He at once sent for the Doctor who  came and stopped the hemorrhage, and then sent me to the hospital where  I remained two weeks.    After I came out of the hospitals the Warden talked to me about my  situation and feelings. He advised me to go into the blacksmith shop,  of course not dreaming that I knew anything of the work; but he said I  would have more liberty there; that the men moved about freely and could  talk to each other; that the work mainly was sharpening picks and tools,  and that I could at least blow and strike. So I went into the blacksmith  shop, and remained their six weeks. But, debilitated as I was, the work  was too hard for me, and so the warden put me in the yard to do what I  could. I also swept the halls and assisted in the cook-room. One day  when the warden spoke to me, I told him that I knew something about  taking care of the sick, and after some conversation, he transferred me  to the hospital as a nurse.    Here, if there is such a things as contentment in prison, I was  comparatively happy. I nursed the sick and administered medicines under  direction of the doctor. I had too, with all easy position, more liberty  than any other prisoner. I could go anywhere about the halls and yard,  and in a few weeks I was frequently sent on an errand into the town.  Everyone seemed to have the fullest confidence in me. The Warden talked  to me whenever he saw me, and always had some kind word for me. One day  I ventured to speak to him about his horse, of which he was very proud,  and indeed the horse was a very fine one.    Mr. Warden, said I \"that's a noble horse of yours; but he interferes  badly, and that is only because he is badly shod. If you will trust me,  I can shoe him so as to prevent all that.\"    \"Can you?\" exclaimed the Warden in great surprise; \"Well, if you can,  I'll give you a good piece of bread and butter, or, anything else you  want.\"    \"I don't want your bread and butter,\" said I \"but I will shoe your horse  as he has never been shod before.\"    \"Well take the horse to the shop and see what you can do.\"    Of course, I knew that by \"bread and butter\" the warden meant that if I  could shoe his favorite horse so as to prevent him from interfering, he  would gladly favor me as far as he could; and I knew, too, that I could  make as good a shoe as any horse need wear. I gladly led the horse to  the shop where I had so signally failed in pick and tool sharpening, and  was received with jeers by my old comrades who wanted to know what I was  going to do to that horse.    \"O, simply shoe him,\" I said.    This greatly increased the mirth of my former shopmates; but their  amusement speedily changed to amazement as they saw me make my nails,  turn the shoes and neatly put them on. In due time the horse was shod,  and I led him to the Warden for inspection; and before him and an  officer who stood by him, I led the horse up and down to show that he  did not interfere. The Warden's delight was unbounded; he never saw such  a set of shoes; he declared that they fitted as if they had grown to the  horse's hoofs. I need not say that from that day till the day I left the  prison,"]]]
