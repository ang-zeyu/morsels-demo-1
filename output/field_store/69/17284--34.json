As for your enemy, after regaining consciousness he will  suffer no inconvenience from the encounter beyond a slight headache.\"    \"That's fine!\" said Rob, as he took the tube.  It was scarcely six  inches long, and hollow at one end.    \"The busy lives of men,\" proceeded the Demon, \"require them to move  about and travel in all directions.  Yet to assist them there are only  such crude and awkward machines as electric trolleys, cable cars, steam  railways and automobiles.  These crawl slowly over the uneven surface  of the earth and frequently get out of order.  It has grieved me that  men have not yet discovered what even birds know: that the atmosphere  offers them swift and easy means of traveling from one part of the  earth's surface to another.\"    \"Some people have tried to build airships,\" remarked Rob.    \"So they have; great, unwieldy machines which offer so much resistance  to the air that they are quite useless.  A big machine is not needed to  carry one through the air.  There are forces in nature which may be  readily used for such purpose.  Tell me, what holds you to the Earth,  and makes a stone fall to the ground?\"    \"Attraction of gravitation,\" said Rob, promptly.    \"Exactly.  That is one force I refer to,\" said the Demon.  \"The force  of repulsion, which is little known, but just as powerful, is another  that mankind may direct.  Then there are the Polar electric forces,  attracting objects toward the north or south poles.  You have guessed  something of this by the use of the compass, or electric needle.  Opposed to these is centrifugal electric force, drawing objects from  east to west, or in the opposite direction.  This force is created by  the whirl of the earth upon its axis, and is easily utilized, although  your scientific men have as yet paid little attention to it.    \"These forces, operating in all directions, absolute and immutable, are  at the disposal of mankind.  They will carry you through the atmosphere  wherever and whenever you choose.  That is, if you know how to control  them.  Now, here is a machine I have myself perfected.\"    The Demon drew from his pocket something that resembled an open-faced  watch, having a narrow, flexible band attached to it.    \"When you wish to travel,\" said he, \"attach this little machine to your  left wrist by means of the band.  It is very light and will not be in  your way.  On this dial are points marked 'up' and 'down' as well as a  perfect compass.  When you desire to rise into the air set the  indicator to the word 'up,' using a finger of your right hand to turn  it.  When you have risen as high as you wish, set the indicator to the  point of the compass you want to follow and you will be carried by the  proper electric force in that direction.  To descend, set the indicator  to the word 'down.'  Do you understand?\"    \"Perfectly!\" cried Rob, taking the machine from the Demon with  unfeigned delight.  \"This is really wonderful, and I'm awfully obliged  to you!\"    \"Don't mention it,\" returned the Demon, dryly.  \"These three gifts you  may amuse yourself with for the next week.  It seems hard to entrust  such great scientific discoveries to the discretion of a mere boy; but  they are quite harmless, so if you exercise proper care you can not get  into trouble through their possession.  And who knows what benefits to  humanity may result?  One week from to-day, at this hour, I will again  appear to you, at which time you shall receive the second series of  electrical gifts.\"    \"I'm not sure,\" said Rob, \"that I shall be able again to make the  connections that will strike the Master Key.\"    \"Probably not,\" answered the Demon.  \"Could you accomplish that, you  might command my services forever.  But, having once succeeded, you are  entitled to the nine gifts--three each week for three weeks--so you  have no need to call me to do my duty.  I shall appear of my own  accord.\"    \"Thank you,\" murmured the boy.    The Demon bowed and spread his hands in the form of a semi-circle.  An  instant later there was a blinding flash, and when Rob recovered from  it and opened his eyes the Demon of Electricity had disappeared.          4.  Testing the Instruments      There is little doubt that this strange experience befallen a grown man  he would have been stricken with a fit of trembling or a sense of  apprehension, or even fear, at the thought of having faced the terrible  Demon of Electricity, of having struck the Master Key of the world's  greatest natural forces, and finding himself possessed of three such  wonderful and useful gifts.  But a boy takes everything as a matter of  course.  As the tree of knowledge sprouts and expands within him,  shooting out leaf after leaf of practical experience, the succession of  surprises dulls his faculty of wonderment.  It takes a great deal to  startle a boy.    Rob was full of delight at his unexpected good fortune; but he did not  stop to consider that there was anything remarkably queer or uncanny in  the manner in which it had come to him.  His chief sensation was one of  pride.  He would now be able to surprise those who had made fun of his  electrical craze and force them to respect his marvelous powers.  He  decided to say nothing about the Demon or the accidental striking of  the Master Key.  In exhibiting to his friends the electrical devices he  had acquired it would be \"no end of fun\" to mark their amazement and  leave them to guess how he performed his feats.    So he put his treasures into his pocket, locked his workshop and went  downstairs to his room to prepare for dinner.    While brushing his hair he remembered it was no longer necessary for  him to eat ordinary food.  He was feeling quite hungry at that moment,  for he had a boy's ravenous appetite; but, taking the silver box from  his pocket, he swallowed a tablet and at once felt his hunger as fully  satisfied as if he had partaken of a hearty meal, while at the same  time he experienced an exhilarating glow throughout his body and a  clearness of brain and gaiety of spirits which filled him with intense  gratification.    Still, he entered the dining-room when the bell rang and found his  father and mother and sisters already assembled there.    \"Where have you been all day, Robert?\" inquired his mother.    \"No need to ask,\" said Mr. Joslyn, with a laugh.  \"Fussing over  electricity, I'll bet a cookie!\"    \"I do wish,\" said the mother, fretfully, \"that he would get over that  mania.  It unfits him for anything else.\"    \"Precisely,\" returned her husband, dishing the soup; \"but it fits him  for a great career when he becomes a man.  Why shouldn't he spend his  summer vacation in pursuit of useful knowledge instead of romping  around like ordinary boys?\"    \"No soup, thank you,\" said Rob.    \"What!\" exclaimed his father, looking at him in surprise, \"it's your  favorite soup.\"    \"I know,\" said Rob, quietly, \"but I don't want any.\"    \"Are you ill, Robert?\" asked his mother.    \"Never felt better in my life,\" answered Rob, truthfully.    Yet Mrs. Joslyn looked worried, and when Rob refused the roast, she was  really shocked.    \"Let me feel your pulse, my poor boy!\" she commanded, and wondered to  find it so regular.    In fact, Rob's action surprised them all.  He sat calmly throughout the  meal, eating nothing, but apparently in good health and spirits, while  even his sisters regarded him with troubled countenances.    \"He's worked too hard, I guess,\" said Mr. Joslyn, shaking his head  sadly.    \"Oh, no; I haven't,\" protested Rob; \"but I've decided not to eat  anything, hereafter.  It's a bad habit, and does more harm than good.\"    \"Wait till breakfast,\" said sister Helen, with a laugh; \"you'll be  hungry enough by that time.\"    However, the boy had no desire for food at breakfast time, either, as  the tablet sufficed for an entire day.  So he renewed the anxiety of  the family by refusing to join them at the table.    \"If this goes on,\" Mr Joslyn said to his son, when breakfast was  finished, \"I shall be obliged to send you away for your health.\"    \"I think of making a trip this morning,\" said Rob, carelessly.    \"Where to?\"    \"Oh, I may go to Boston, or take a run over to Cuba or Jamaica,\"  replied the boy.    \"But you can not go so far by yourself,\" declared his father; \"and  there is no one to go with you, just now.  Nor can I spare the money at  present for so expensive a trip.\"    \"Oh, it won't cost anything,\" replied Rob, with a smile.    Mr. Joslyn looked upon him gravely and sighed.  Mrs. Joslyn bent over  her son with tears in her eyes and said:    \"This electrical nonsense has affected your mind, dear.  You must  promise me to keep away from that horrid workshop for a time.\"    \"I won't enter it for a week,\" he answered.  \"But you needn't worry  about me.  I haven't been experimenting with electricity all this time  for nothing, I can tell you.  As for my health, I'm as well and strong  as any boy need be, and there's nothing wrong with my head, either.  Common folks always think great men are crazy, but Edison and Tesla and  I don't pay any attention to that.  We've got our discoveries to look  after.  Now, as I said, I'm going for a little trip in the interests of  science.  I may be back to-night, or I may be gone several days.  Anyhow, I'll be back in a week, and you mustn't worry about me a single  minute.\"    \"How are you going?\" inquired his father, in the gentle, soothing tone  persons use in addressing maniacs.    \"Through the air,\" said Rob.    His father groaned.    \"Where's your balloon?\" inquired sister Mabel, sarcastically.    \"I don't need a balloon,\" returned the boy.  \"That's a clumsy way of  traveling, at best.  I shall go by electric propulsion.\"    \"Good gracious!\" cried Mr. Joslyn, and the mother murmured: \"My poor  boy! my poor boy!\"    \"As you are my nearest relatives,\" continued Rob, not noticing these  exclamations, \"I will allow you to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43607"],[0,"Builders of United Italy (#3)"],[1,"sions,  told him that such a result was impossible. With his ardor completely  cooled and his mind given to the bitterest thoughts he left London, and  after short stays in The Hague and Paris journeyed into Spain.    In Paris he had bought the best known Italian authors and at this time  commenced to read them, although it was not until much later that he  began to appreciate them at their real worth. He did, however, carry  them with him on his travels, and gradually learned something at first  hand of that great galaxy, Dante, Tasso, Petrarch, Ariosto, Boccaccio,  and Machiavelli. His mind was not yet ripe for any study, even as he  traveled in Spain he was still subject to those wild outbreaks of  despondency and passion which alternately seemed to seize upon him.  He became a creature of chance whims, now he was ready to yield to  the quiet contentment of a suitable marriage, now burning with rage  against all the customs of society. Morbid ideas continually pressed his  footsteps. The atmosphere of a malevolent passion seems almost always  surrounding the great tragedies he later penned, and that atmosphere was  generated by a nature which from earliest youth had been extraordinarily  violent. His temper was wholly ungovernable. One evening in Madrid, as  Alfieri's faithful valet, the companion of all his travels, was curling  his hair, he accidentally pulled it so sharply with the tongs that  Alfieri winced. Instantly he sprang from his chair, and seizing a heavy  candlestick, hurled it at the servant. It struck the man on the temple,  and instantly his face was covered with blood. He rushed at his master,  but fortunately a young Spaniard who was present came to the rescue,  and separated them. Immediately Alfieri was covered with shame. \"Had  you killed me,\" he said to the man, \"you would have acted rightly. If  you wish, kill me while I sleep to-night, for I deserve it.\" The valet  took no such reprisal, he had been with his young master long enough to  understand the sudden outbursts of his temper, and was content to keep  the two blood-stained handkerchiefs that had bandaged his head and show  them occasionally to Alfieri as a reminder.    In Lisbon the traveler formed a close friendship with the Abbot of  Caluso, whom he called a \"true, living Montaigne.\" The Abbot tried to  interest the young man in literature, induced him to write some verses,  and gave him the benefit of his criticism. For a short time the interest  in poetry lasted, then it flagged, and again Alfieri felt himself  without any purpose. He decided to return home, and in May, 1772,  arrived at Turin.    Now he took a house for himself, furnished it elaborately, and made  it the headquarters of a youthful society that sought amusement in  various forms. Some of them wrote, and Alfieri tried his pen for their  amusement, but soon tired of writing as a sport, and gave himself up  to other occupations. Continually searching for something to still  his restlessness he again fell in love, this time with a woman of  rank, some ten years his senior, and of a most unenviable reputation.  He became absolutely her slave, worked himself into frenzies on her  account, would consider nothing but the happiness of being with her. He  fell very ill, but when he recovered found himself as much in love as  ever. For two years he lived in this state of obsession, tormented by  self-reproach, but unable to rid himself of his own yoke.    Finally he decided to quit Turin and break his fetters. When he was  only a short distance on the road to Rome his resolution failed and  he returned. Again he resolved to leave the city for a year. The year  lasted eight days. He was thoroughly ashamed, disliked being seen in  Turin, but could not keep away. He felt finally that he must take  one last stand or lose all self-respect and control forever. He had  his hair cut so short that he dared not appear in society, and shut  himself into his house to read. He could not keep his thoughts on the  books, and tried composition. He wrote a sonnet, and sent it to a  friend, and received a reply highly praising it. Then he remembered  that a year before as he sat watching by the sick bed of the woman who  had so charmed him he had lightly outlined a tragedy on the life of  Cleopatra, taking his subject from tapestries that hung in the room.  He threw himself into the work of writing that tragedy now, and found  that interest in it drove all other thoughts away. He wrote rapidly,  continually, only stopping when he was completely tired. When those  times came, still frightened with the possibility of leaving the house,  he had himself tied into a chair. He only allowed himself freedom when  he knew he had won self-control. By that time he had finished his  tragedy in blank verse called \"Cleopatra,\" and a short farce called \"The  Poets,\" the latter ridiculing the former. He sent them to a theater in  Turin, where they were produced on June 16, 1775, and met with success.  The author did not value either play highly himself, and sought to have  them withdrawn. He wrote later, comparing these works with those of his  contemporaries, \"The sole difference which existed between their pieces  and mine was that the former were productions of learned incapacity,  whereas mine was the premature offspring of ignorance, which promised  one day to become something.\"    His battle against what he considered a highly unworthy infatuation had  restored Alfieri's self-respect and health, and out of this curious  struggle sprang his first real and lasting ambition. \"A devouring fire  took possession of my soul,\" he says, \"I thirsted one day to become  a deserving candidate for theatrical fame.\" The date of that first  performance marked a turning point, not only for Alfieri, but for his  country's literature. It was, said the Italian critic, Paravia, \"a day  and a year of eternal memory not only for the Turinese, but for all  Italians; because it was, so to speak, the dawn of the magnificent day  which, thanks to Alfieri, was to rise upon Italian tragedy.\"    The restless energy which had driven Alfieri across the various European  countries now concentrated in an all-pervading determination to become  a tragic poet. He launched into that effort with the same unbounded  ardor with which he had so frequently before launched into love. He  was twenty-seven years of age when he seriously set himself to work to  acquire command of Italian so that he might think in the language of his  native land rather than in that of France. He described his resources  as \"a resolute, obstinate, and ungovernable character, susceptible of  the warmest affections, among which, by an odd kind of a combination,  predominated the most ardent love, and hatred approaching to madness  against every species of tyranny; an imperfect and vague recollection  of several French tragedies which I had seen represented several years  before, but which I had then neither read nor studied; a total ignorance  of dramatic rules, and an incapability of expressing myself with  elegance and precision in my own language.\"    To accomplish his purpose Alfieri now began at the very beginning and  took up the study of Italian grammar, and thence made a first-hand  acquaintance with all the best of the early Italian writers. He would  not allow himself any longer to read French, and tried to break himself  of the habit of thinking in that tongue. He moved from town into a small  country village in order that nothing might distract him. There he  re-wrote for the third time his tragedy of \"Cleopatra,\" and practised  turning into Italian verses the outlines of two tragedies which he had  recently written in French. He pored over Tasso, Ariosto, Petrarch, and  Dante until he felt that he at last really caught the full spirit of  each author's style, then he tried writing poetry of his own.    His ignorance of Latin continually vexed him, and now he employed a  teacher to begin over those lessons he had so thoroughly disliked at  school. It was very hard work at first, but he would learn what he now  considered essential to his purpose, and after three months' study of  Horace he found that he could read Latin. He took up the other classics  and translated some of them into modern Italian for practice in their  varied styles.    Turin was too near France to satisfy his new passion for only the purest  Italian and so he went to Pisa, and thence to Florence. In the latter  city he found that his ideas were at last shaping themselves in the  rich and clear Italian he was seeking, he wrote verses which critical  friends pronounced at last worthy of the name of poetry, and planned  several poetic tragedies. He had worked hard and felt that he needed a  little rest. For this purpose he returned to Turin and had the pleasure  of entertaining his old friend the Abbot of Caluso there. He, as well as  other friends, urged Alfieri to make literature his field. He decided  that it was best for him to live in Tuscany, and as he hated to have  to ask royal permission each year to allow him to remain away from  Piedmont--as was the custom with the nobility--he gave his estates at  Asti to his sister, and contented himself with half his former income.  Then he moved to Florence, which, except for intervals spent at Rome and  Naples, was for a considerable time to be his home.    On his way to Florence Alfieri was obliged to stop at Sarzana, where  he chanced upon a copy of Livy, and was so impressed with the story  of Virginia and Icilius that he immediately planned a tragedy on the  subject. Soon after he reached Pisa, but there he did not dare stay,  fearful that he might be involved in a marriage with a young girl whom  he had met there before and with whom he says that he had almost fallen  in love. He himself contrasts his feelings at that time with those he  had entertained when he had first thought of marriage. \"Eight years  afterwards, my"]]]
