I have many enemies, citizen ... one especially ... a woman.... She is  always prying and spying on me.... So beware of any woman you see  lurking about at your heels.\"    Mole gave a half-audible grunt in reply.    \"You had best go after dark,\" the other rejoined after awhile. \"Come  back to me after nine o'clock. It is not far to the Chemin de  Pantin--just where it intersects the Route de Meaux. You can get there  and back before midnight. The people will admit you. I will give you a  ring--the only thing I possess.... It has little or no value,\" he added  with a harsh, grating laugh. \"It will not be worth your while to steal  it. You will have to see a brat and report to me on his condition--his  appearance, what?... Talk to him a bit.... See what he says and let me  know. It is not difficult.\"    \"No, citizen.\"    Mole helped the suffering wretch into his bath. Not a movement, not a  quiver of the eyelid betrayed one single emotion which he may have  felt--neither loathing nor sympathy, only placid indifference. He was  just a half-starved menial, thankful to accomplish any task for the sake  of satisfying a craving stomach. Marat stretched out his shrunken limbs  in the herbal water with a sigh of well-being.    \"And the ring, citizen?\" Mole suggested presently.    The demagogue held up his left hand--it was emaciated and disfigured by  disease. A cheap-looking metal ring, set with a false stone, glistened  upon the fourth finger.    \"Take it off,\" he said curtly.    The ring must have all along been too small for the bony hand of the  once famous Court physician. Even now it appeared embedded in the flabby  skin and refused to slide over the knuckle.    \"The water will loosen it,\" remarked Mole quietly.    Marat dipped his hand back into the water, and the other stood beside  him, silent and stolid, his broad shoulders bent, his face naught but a  mask, void and expressionless beneath its coating of grime.    One or two seconds went by. The air was heavy with steam and a medley of  evil-smelling fumes, which hung in the close atmosphere of the narrow  room. The sick man appeared to be drowsy, his head rolled over to one  side, his eyes closed. He had evidently forgotten all about the ring.    A woman's voice, shrill and peremptory, broke the silence which had  become oppressive:    \"Here, citizen Mole, I want you! There's not a bit of wood chopped up  for my fire, and how am I to make the coffee without firing, I should  like to know?\"    \"The ring, citizen,\" Mole urged gruffly.    Marat had been roused by the woman's sharp voice. He cursed her for a  noisy harridan; then he said fretfully:    \"It will do presently--when you are ready to start. I said nine o'clock  ... it is only four now. I am tired. Tell citizeness Evrard to bring me  some hot coffee in an hour's time.... You can go and fetch me the  Moniteur now, and take back these proofs to citizen Dufour. You will  find him at the 'Cordeliers,' or else at the printing works.... Come  back at nine o'clock.... I am tired now ... too tired to tell you where  to find the house which is off the Chemin de Pantin. Presently will  do....\"    Even while he spoke he appeared to drop into a fitful sleep. His two  hands were hidden under the sheet which covered the bath. Mole watched  him in silence for a moment or two, then he turned on his heel and  shuffled off through the ante-room into the kitchen beyond, where  presently he sat down, squatting in an angle by the stove, and started  with his usual stolidness to chop wood for the citizeness' fire.    When this task was done, and he had received a chunk of sour bread for  his reward from Jeannette Marechal, the cook, he shuffled out of the  place and into the street, to do his employer's errands.      IV    Paul Mole had been to the offices of the Moniteur and to the printing  works of L'Ami du Peuple. He had seen the citizen Dufour at the Club  and, presumably, had spent the rest of his time wandering idly about the  streets of the quartier, for he did not return to the Rue des Cordeliers  until nearly nine o'clock.    As soon as he came to the top of the street, he fell in with the crowd  which had collected outside No. 30. With his habitual slouchy gait and  the steady pressure of his powerful elbows, he pushed his way to the  door, whilst gleaning whisperings and rumours on his way.    \"The citizen Marat has been assassinated.\"    \"By a woman.\"    \"A mere girl.\"    \"A wench from Caen. Her name is Corday.\"    \"The people nearly tore her to pieces awhile ago.\"    \"She is as much as guillotined already.\"    The latter remark went off with a loud guffaw and many a ribald joke.    Mole, despite his great height, succeeded in getting through  unperceived. He was of no account, and he knew his way inside the house.  It was full of people: journalists, gaffers, women and men--the usual  crowd that come to gape. The citizen Marat was a great personage. The  Friend of the People. An Incorruptible, if ever there was one. Just look  at the simplicity, almost the poverty, in which he lived! Only the  aristos hated him, and the fat bourgeois who battened on the people.  Citizen Marat had sent hundreds of them to the guillotine with a stroke  of his pen or a denunciation from his fearless tongue.    Mole did not pause to listen to these comments. He pushed his way  through the throng up the stairs, to his late employer's lodgings on the  first floor.    The anteroom was crowded, so were the other rooms; but the greatest  pressure was around the door immediately facing him, the one which gave  on the bathroom. In the kitchen on his right, where awhile ago he had  been chopping wood under a flood of abuse from Jeannette Marechal, he  caught sight of this woman, cowering by the hearth, her filthy apron  thrown over her head, and crying--yes! crying for the loathsome  creature, who had expiated some of his abominable crimes at the hands of  a poor, misguided girl, whom an infuriated mob was even now threatening  to tear to pieces in its rage.    The parlour and even Simonne's room were also filled with people: men,  most of whom Mole knew by sight; friends or enemies of the ranting  demagogue who lay murdered in the very bath which his casual servant had  prepared for him. Every one was discussing the details of the murder,  the punishment of the youthful assassin. Simonne Evrard was being loudly  blamed for having admitted the girl into citizen Marat's room. But the  wench had looked so simple, so innocent, and she said she was the bearer  of a message from Caen. She had called twice during the day, and in the  evening the citizen himself said that he would see her. Simonne had been  for sending her away. But the citizen was peremptory. And he was so  helpless ... in his bath ... name of a name, the pitiable affair!    No one paid much attention to Mole. He listened for a while to Simonne's  impassioned voice, giving her version of the affair; then he worked his  way stolidly into the bathroom.    It was some time before he succeeded in reaching the side of that awful  bath wherein lay the dead body of Jean Paul Marat. The small room was  densely packed--not with friends, for there was not a man or woman  living, except Simonne Evrard and her sisters, whom the bloodthirsty  demagogue would have called \"friend\"; but his powerful personality had  been a menace to many, and now they came in crowds to see that he was  really dead, that a girl's feeble hand had actually done the deed which  they themselves had only contemplated. They stood about whispering,  their heads averted from the ghastly spectacle of this miserable  creature, to whom even death had failed to lend his usual attribute of  tranquil dignity.    The tiny room was inexpressibly hot and stuffy. Hardly a breath of  outside air came in through the narrow window, which only gave on the  bedroom beyond. An evil-smelling oil-lamp swung from the low ceiling and  shed its feeble light on the upturned face of the murdered man.    Mole stood for a moment or two, silent and pensive, beside that hideous  form. There was the bath, just as he had prepared it: the board spread  over with a sheet and laid across the bath, above which only the head  and shoulders emerged, livid and stained. One hand, the left, grasped  the edge of the board with the last convulsive clutch of supreme agony.    On the fourth finger of that hand glistened the shoddy ring which Marat  had said was not worth stealing. Yet, apparently, it roused the cupidity  of the poor wretch who had served him faithfully for these last few  days, and who now would once more be thrown, starving and friendless,  upon the streets of Paris.    Mole threw a quick, furtive glance around him. The crowd which had come  to gloat over the murdered Terrorist stood about whispering, with heads  averted, engrossed in their own affairs. He slid his hand  surreptitiously over that of the dead man. With dexterous manipulation  he lifted the finger round which glistened the metal ring. Death  appeared to have shrivelled the flesh still more upon the bones, to have  contracted the knuckles and shrunk the tendons. The ring slid off quite  easily. Mole had it in his hand, when suddenly a rough blow struck him  on the shoulder.    \"Trying to rob the dead?\" a stern voice shouted in his ear. \"Are you a  disguised aristo, or what?\"    At once the whispering ceased. A wave of excitement went round the room.  Some people shouted, others pressed forward to gaze on the abandoned  wretch who had been caught in the act of committing a gruesome deed.    \"Robbing the dead!\"    They were experts in evil, most of these men here. Their hands were  indelibly stained with some of the foulest crimes ever recorded in  history.

As the old gentleman  closed the door after him, Mr. Slick drew near to me,  and said in an under tone, that is what I call \"SOFT  SAWDER.\" An Englishman would pass that man as a sheep  passes a hog in a pasture, without looking at him; or,  said he, looking rather archly, if he was mounted on a  pretty smart horse, I guess he'd trot away, IF HE COULD.  Now I find--here his lecture on \"SOFT SAWDER\" was cut  short by the entrance of Mrs. Flint. Jist come to say  good bye, Mrs. Flint. What, have you sold all your  clocks? yes, and very low, too, for money is scarce, and  I wished to close the concarn; no, I am wrong in saying  all, for I have just one left. Neighbor Steel's wife  asked to have the refusal of it, but I guess I won't sell  it; I had but two of them, this one and the feller of  it, that I sold Governor Lincoln. General Green, the  Secretary of State for Maine, said he'd give me 50 dollars  for this here one--it has composition wheels and patent  axles, it is a beautiful article--a real first chop--no  mistake, genuine superfine, but I guess I'll take it  back; and beside, Squire Hawk might think kinder harder,  that I did not give him the offer. Dear me, said Mrs.  Flint, I should like to see it, where is it? It is in a  chest of mine over the way, at Tom Tape's store, I guess  he can ship it on to Eastport. That's a good man, said  Mrs. Flint, jist let's look at it Mr. Slick, willing to  oblige, yielded to these entreaties, and soon produced  the clock--a gawdy, highly varnished, trumpery looking  affair. He placed it on the chimney-piece, where its  beauties were painted out and duly appreciated by Mrs.  Flint, whose admiration was about ending in a proposal,  when Mr. Flint returned from giving his directions about  the care of the horses. The Deacon praised the clock, he  too thought it a handsome one; but the Deacon was a  prudent man, he had a watch, he was sorry, but he had no  occasion for a clock. I guess you're in the wrong furrow  this time, Deacon, it ant for sale, said Mr. Slick; and  if it was, I reckon neighbor Steel's wife would have it,  for she gives me no peace about it. Mrs. Flint said, that  Mr. Steele had enough to do, poor man, to pay his interest,  without buying clocks for his wife. It's no concarn of  mine, said Mr. Slick, as long as he pays me, what he has  to do, but I guess I don't want to sell it, and beside  it comes too high; that clock can't be made at Rhode  Island under 40 dollars. Why it ant possible, said the  Clockmaker, in apparent surprise, looking at his watch,  why as I'm alive it is 4 o'clock, and if I hav'nt been  two hours here--how on airth shall I reach River Philip  to-night? I'll tell you what, Mrs. Flint, I'll leave the  clock in your care till I return on my way to the States  --I'll set it a going and put it to the right time. As  soon as this operation was performed, he delivered the  key to the deacon with a sort of serio-comic injunction  to wind up the clock every Saturday night, which Mrs.  Flint said she would take care should be done, and promised  to remind her husband of it, in case he should chance to  forget it.    That, said the Clockmaker as soon as we were mounted,  that I call 'HUMAN NATUR!' Now that clock is sold for 40  dollars--it cost me just 6 dollars and 50 cents. Mrs.  Flint will never let Mrs. Steel have the refusal--nor  will the deacon learn until I call for the clock, that  having once indulged in the use of a superfluity, how  difficult it is to give it up. We can do without any  article of luxury we have never had, but when once  obtained, it is not 'IN HUMAN NATUR' to surrender it  voluntarily. Of fifteen thousand sold by myself and  partners in this Province, twelve thousand were left in  this manner, and only ten clocks were ever returned--  when we called for them they invariably bought them. We  trust to 'SOFT SAWDER' to get them into the house, and  to 'HUMAN NATUR' that they never come out of it.          No. III    The Silent Girls.    Do you see them are swallows, said the Clockmaker, how  low they fly? Well I presume we shall have rain right  away, and them noisy critters, them gulls how close they  keep to the water, down there in the Shubenacadie; well  that's a sure sign. If we study natur, we don't want no  thermometer. But I guess we shall be in time to get under  cover in a shingle-maker's shed about three miles ahead  on us. We had just reached the deserted hovel when the  rain fell in torrents.    I reckon, said the Clockmaker, as he sat himself down on  a bundle of shingles, I reckon they are bad off for inns  in this country. When a feller is too lazy to work here,  he paints his name over his door, and calls it a tavern,  and as like as not he makes the whole neighbourhood as  lazy as himself--it is about as easy to find a good inn  in Halifax, as it is to find wool on a goat's back. An  inn, to be a good concarn, must be built a purpose, you  can no more make a good tavern out of a common dwelling  house, I expect, than a good coat out of an old pair of  trowsers. They are etarnal lazy, you may depend--now  there might be a grand spec made there, in building a  good Inn and a good Church. What a sacrilegious and  unnatural union, said I, with most unaffected surprise.  Not at all, said Mr. Slick, we build both on speculation  in the States, and make a good deal of profit out of 'em  too, I tell you. We look out a good sightly place, in a  town like Halifax, that is pretty considerably well  peopled, with folks that are good marks; and if there is  no real right down good preacher among them, we build a  handsome Church, touched off like a New-York liner, a  real taking looking thing--and then we look out for a  preacher, a crack man, a regular ten horse power chap  --well, we hire him, and we have to give pretty high  wages too, say twelve hundred or sixteen hundred dollars  a year. We take him at first on trial for a Sabbath or  two, to try his paces, and if he takes with the folks,  if he goes down well, we clinch the bargain, and let and  sell the pews; and, I tell you it pays well and makes a  real good investment. There were few better specs among  us than Inns and Churches, until the Railroads came on  the carpet--as soon as the novelty of the new preacher  wears off, we hire another, and that keeps up the steam.  I trust it will be long, very long, my friend, said I,  ere the rage for speculation introduces \"the money changers  into the temple,\" with us. Mr. Slick looked at me with  a most ineffable expression of pity and surprise. Depend  on it, Sir, said he, with a most philosophical air, this  Province is much behind the intelligence of the age. But  if it is behind us in that respect, it is a long chalk  ahead on us in others.    I never seed or heard tell of a country that had so many  natural privileges as this. Why there are twice as many  harbors and water powers were, as we have all the way  from Eastport to New OrLEENS. They have all they can ax,  and more than they desarve. They have iron, coal, slate,  grindstone, lime, firestone, gypsum, freestone, and a  list as long as an auctioneer's catalogue. But they are  either asleep, or stone blind to them. Their shores are  crowded with fish, and their lands covered with wood. A  government that lays as light on 'em as a down counterpin,  and no taxes. Then look at their dykes. The Lord seems  to have made 'em on purpose for such lazy folks. If you  were to tell the citizens of our country, that these  dykes had been cropped for a hundred years without manure,  they'd say, they guessed you had seen Col. Crookett, the  greatest hand at a flam in our nation. You have heerd  tell of a man who could'nt see London for the houses, I  tell you, if we had this country, you could'nt see the  harbors for the shipping. There'd be a rush of folks to  it, as there is in one of our inns, to the dinner table,  when they sometimes get jammed together in the door-way,  and a man has to take a running leap over their heads,  afore he can get in. A little nigger boy in New York  found a diamond worth 2,000 dollars; well, he sold it to  a watchmaker for 50 cents--the little critter did'nt  know no better. Your people are just like the nigger boy,  they don't know the value of their diamond.    Do you know the reason monkeys are no good? because they  chatter all day long--so do the niggers--and so do the  Blue Noses of Nova Scotia--its all talk and no work; now,  with us its all work and no talk--in our ship yards,  our factories, our mills, and even in our Vessels, there's  no talk--a man can't work and talk too. I guess if you  were at the factories at Lowell we'd show you a wonder  --five hundred galls at work together, all in silence.  I don't think our great country has such a real natural  curiosity as that--I expect the world don't contain the  beat of that; for a woman's tongue goes so slick of  itself, without water power or steam, and moves so easy  on its hinges, that its no easy matter to put a spring  stop on it, I tell you--it comes as natural as drinkin  mint julip.    I don't pretend to say the galls don't nullify the rule,  sometimes at intermission and arter hours, but when they  do, if they don't let go, then its a pity. You have heerd  a school come out, of little boys, Lord its no touch to  it; or a flock of geese at it, they are no more a match  for em than a pony is for a coach-horse. But when they  are at work, all's as still as sleep and no snoring. I  guess we have a right to brag o' that invention--we  trained the dear critters, so they don't think of striking  the minutes and seconds no longer.    Now the folks of Halifax take it all out in talking--  they talk of steamboats, whalers and rail roads--but they  all end where they begin--in talk. I don't think I'd be  out in my latitude, if I was to say they beat the women  kind at that. One feller says, I talk of"]]]
