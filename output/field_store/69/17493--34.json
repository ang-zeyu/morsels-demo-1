Yesterday he was telling me in what great reverence people of this  locality hold the sacred river Ganges. If one of their relatives dies, he  said, and they have not the means of taking the ashes to the Ganges, they  powder a piece of bone from his funeral pyre and keep it till they come  across some one who, some time or other, has drunk of the Ganges. To him  they administer some of this powder, hidden in the usual offering of  _pan_[1], and thus are content to imagine that a portion of the  remains of their deceased relative has gained purifying contact with the  sacred water.    [Footnote 1: Spices wrapped in betel leaf.]    I smiled as I remarked: \"This surely must be an invention.\"    He pondered deeply before he admitted after a pause: \"Yes, it may be.\"          ON THE WAY.    _February_ 1891.      We have got past the big rivers and just turned into a little one.    The village women are standing in the water, bathing or washing clothes;  and some, in their dripping _saris_, with veils pulled well over  their faces, move homeward with their water vessels filled and clasped  against the left flank, the right arm swinging free. Children, covered all  over with clay, are sporting boisterously, splashing water on each other,  while one of them shouts a song, regardless of the tune.    Over the high banks, the cottage roofs and the tops of the bamboo clumps  are visible. The sky has cleared and the sun is shining. Remnants of  clouds cling to the horizon like fluffs of cotton wool. The breeze is  warmer.    There are not many boats in this little river; only a few dinghies, laden  with dry branches and twigs, are moving leisurely along to the tired  plash! plash! of their oars. At the river's edge the fishermen's nets are  hung out to dry between bamboo poles. And work everywhere seems to be over  for the day.          CHUHALI.    _June_ 1891.      I had been sitting out on the deck for more than a quarter of an hour when  heavy clouds rose in the west. They came up, black, tumbled, and tattered,  with streaks of lurid light showing through here and there. The little  boats scurried off into the smaller arm of the river and clung with their  anchors safely to its banks. The reapers took up the cut sheaves on their  heads and hied homewards; the cows followed, and behind them frisked the  calves waving their tails.    Then came an angry roar. Torn-off scraps of cloud hurried up from the  west, like panting messengers of evil tidings. Finally, lightning and  thunder, rain and storm, came on altogether and executed a mad dervish  dance. The bamboo clumps seemed to howl as the raging wind swept the  ground with them, now to the east, now to the west. Over all, the storm  droned like a giant snake-charmer's pipe, and to its rhythm swayed  hundreds and thousands of crested waves, like so many hooded snakes. The  thunder was incessant, as though a whole world was being pounded to pieces  away there behind the clouds.    With my chin resting on the ledge of an open window facing away from the  wind, I allowed my thoughts to take part in this terrible revelry; they  leapt into the open like a pack of schoolboys suddenly set free. When,  however, I got a thorough drenching from the spray of the rain, I had to  shut up the window and my poetising, and retire quietly into the darkness  inside, like a caged bird.          SHAZADPUR.    _June_ 1891.      From the bank to which the boat is tied a kind of scent rises out of the  grass, and the heat of the ground, given off in gasps, actually touches my  body. I feel that the warm, living Earth is breathing upon me, and that  she, also, must feel my breath.    The young shoots of rice are waving in the breeze, and the ducks are in  turn thrusting their heads beneath the water and preening their feathers.  There is no sound save the faint, mournful creaking of the gangway against  the boat, as she imperceptibly swings to and fro in the current.    Not far off there is a ferry. A motley crowd has assembled under the  banyan tree awaiting the boat's return; and as soon as it arrives, they  eagerly scramble in. I enjoy watching this for hours together. It is  market-day in the village on the other bank; that is why the ferry is so  busy. Some carry bundles of hay, some baskets, some sacks; some are going  to the market, others coming from it. Thus, in this silent noonday, the  stream of human activity slowly flows across the river between two  villages.    I sat wondering: Why is there always this deep shade of melancholy over  the fields arid river banks, the sky and the sunshine of our country? And  I came to the conclusion that it is because with us Nature is obviously  the more important thing. The sky is free, the fields limitless; and the  sun merges them into one blazing whole. In the midst of this, man seems so  trivial. He comes and goes, like the ferry-boat, from this shore to the  other; the babbling hum of his talk, the fitful echo of his song, is  heard; the slight movement of his pursuit of his own petty desires is seen  in the world's market-places: but how feeble, how temporary, how  tragically meaningless it all seems amidst the immense aloofness of the  Universe!    The contrast between the beautiful, broad, unalloyed peace of  Nature--calm, passive, silent, unfathomable,--and our own everyday  worries--paltry, sorrow-laden, strife-tormented, puts me beside myself as  I keep staring at the hazy, distant, blue line of trees which fringe the  fields across the river.    Where Nature is ever hidden, and cowers under mist and cloud, snow and  darkness, there man feels himself master; he regards his desires, his  works, as permanent; he wants to perpetuate them, he looks towards  posterity, he raises monuments, he writes biographies; he even goes the  length of erecting tombstones over the dead. So busy is he that he has not  time to consider how many monuments crumble, how often names are  forgotten!          SHAZADPUR.    _June_ 1891.      There was a great, big mast lying on the river bank, and some little  village urchins, with never a scrap of clothing, decided, after a long  consultation, that if it could be rolled along to the accompaniment of a  sufficient amount of vociferous clamour, it would be a new and altogether  satisfactory kind of game. The decision was no sooner come to than acted  upon, with a \"_Shabash_, brothers! All together! Heave ho!\" And at  every turn it rolled, there was uproarious laughter.    The demeanour of one girl in the party was very different. She was playing  with the boys for want of other companions, but she clearly viewed with  disfavour these loud and strenuous games. At last she stepped up to the  mast and, without a word, deliberately sat on it.    So rare a game to come to so abrupt a stop! Some of the players seemed to  resign themselves to giving it up as a bad job; and retiring a little way  off, they sulkily glared at the girl in her impassive gravity. One made as  if he would push her off, but even this did not disturb the careless ease  of her pose. The eldest lad came up to her and pointed to other equally  suitable places for taking a rest; at which she energetically shook her  head, and putting her hands in her lap, steadied herself down still more  firmly on her seat. Then at last they had recourse to physical argument  and were completely successful.    Once again joyful shouts rent the skies, and the mast rolled along so  gloriously that even the girl had to cast aside her pride and her  dignified exclusiveness and make a pretence of joining in the unmeaning  excitement. But one could see all the time that she was sure boys never  know how to play properly, and are always so childish! If only she had the  regulation yellow earthen doll handy, with its big, black top-knot, would  she ever have deigned to join in this silly game with these foolish boys?    All of a sudden the idea of another splendid pastime occurred to the boys.  Two of them got hold of a third by the arms and legs and began to swing  him. This must have been great fun, for they all waxed enthusiastic over  it. But it was more than the girl could stand, so she disdainfully left  the playground and marched off home.    Then there was an accident. The boy who was being swung was let fall. He  left his companions in a pet, and went and lay down on the grass with his  arms crossed under his head, desiring to convey thereby that never again  would he have anything to do with this bad, hard world, but would forever  lie, alone by himself, with his arms under his head, and count the stars  and watch the play of the clouds.    The eldest boy, unable to bear the idea of such untimely  world-renunciation, ran up to the disconsolate one and taking his head on  his own knees repentantly coaxed him. \"Come, my little brother! Do get up,  little brother! Have we hurt you, little brother?\" And before long I found  them playing, like two pups, at catching and snatching away each other's  hands! Two minutes had hardly passed before the little fellow was swinging  again.          SHAZADPUR,    _June_ 1891.      I had a most extraordinary dream last night. The whole of Calcutta seemed  enveloped in some awful mystery, the houses being only dimly visible  through a dense, dark mist, within the veil of which there were strange  doings.    I was going along Park Street in a hackney carriage, and as I passed St.  Xavier's College I found it had started growing rapidly and was fast  getting impossibly high within its enveloping haze. Then it was borne in  on me that a band of magicians had come to Calcutta who, if they were paid  for it, could bring about many such wonders.    When I arrived at our Jorasanko house, I found these magicians had turned  up there too.

Then it dawns upon us, that, after all,  Tacitus was not really an intimate at Capri; that he never received the  secret confidences of Tiberius, nor attended upon his diversions. And at  last it is borne in upon us, as we read, that, if we put aside rumours  and uncertain gossip, whatever Tiberius does and says is unusually fine:  but that Tacitus is not satisfied with recording words and actions;  that he supplies motives to them, and then passes judgment upon his  own assumptions: that the evidence for the murder of Germanicus, for  instance, would hardly be accepted in a court of law; and that if Piso  were there found guilty, the Emperor could not be touched. At any rate,  we find it stated in \"The Annals,\" that \"Tiberius by the temptations of  money was incorruptible;\" and he refused the legacies of strangers,  or of those who had natural heirs. \"He wished to restore the people to  severer manners,\" like many sovereigns; unlike the most of them, \"in his  own household, he observed the ancient parsimony.\" Besides the \"severa  paupertas\" of Camillus and Fabricius, he had something of their  primitive integrity; and he declined, with scorn, to be an accomplice in  the proposed assassination of Arminius: \"non fraude neque occultis, sed  palam et armatum, Populum Romanum hostes suos ulcisci.\" He protected  magistrates and poor suitors, against the nobles. He refused to add to  the public burdens, by pensioning needy Senators: but he was  charitable to poor debtors; and lavish to the people, whether Romans or  Provincials, in times of calamity and want. Not least admirable was his  quiet dignity, in periods of disturbance and of panic: he refused to  hurry to the mutinous legions, or to a mean rebellion in Gaul; and he  condescended to reason excellently about his behaviour, when his  people were sane enough to listen. He was both sensible and modest: he  restrained the worship of Augustus, \"lest through being too common  it should be turned into an idle ceremony;\" he refused the worship of  himself, except in one temple dedicated equally to the Senate and to  the Emperor. Tiberius could be pathetic, too: \"I bewail my son, and ever  shall bewail him,\" he says of Germanicus; and again, \"Eloquence is not  measured by fortune, and it is a sufficient honour, if he be ranked  among the ancient orators.\" \"Princes are mortal;\" he says again, \"the  Commonwealth, eternal.\" Then his wit, how fine it was; how quick his  humour: when he answered the tardy condolences from Troy, by lamenting  the death of Hector: when he advised an eager candidate, \"not to  embarrass his eloquence by impetuosity;\" when he said of another, a  low, conceited person, \"he gives himself the airs of a dozen ancestors,\"  \"videtur mihi ex se natus:\" when he muttered in the Senate, \"O homines  ad servitutem paratos:\" when he refused to become a persecutor; \"It  would be much better, if the Gods were allowed to manage their own  affairs,\" \"Deorum injurias Dis curae.\" In all this; in his leisured  ways, in his dislike of parade and ceremonial, in his mockery of  flatterers and venal \"patriots\"; how like to Charles II., \"the last  King of England who was a man of parts.\" And no one will deny \"parts\"  to Tiberius; he was equal to the burden of Imperial cares: the latest  researches have discovered, that his provincial administration was  most excellent; and even Tacitus admits, that his choice of magistrates  \"could not have been better.\" He says, in another passage, \"The  Emperor's domains throughout Italy, were thin; the behaviour of his  slaves modest; the freed-men, who managed his house, few; and, in his  disputes with particulars, the courts were open and the law equal.\" This  resembles the account of Antoninus Pius, by Marcus Aurelius; and it is  for this modesty, this careful separation between private and public  affairs, that Tacitus has praised Agricola. I am well contented, with  the virtues of the Antonines; but there are those, who go beyond. I have  seen a book entitled \"The History of that Inimitable Monarch Tiberius,  who in the xiv year of his Reign requested the Senate to permit the  worship of Jesus Christ; and who suppressed all Opposition to it.\" In  this learned volume, it is proved out of the Ancients, that Tiberius was  the most perfect of all sovereigns; and he is shown to be nothing  less than the forerunner of Saint Peter, the first Apostle and the  nursing-father of the Christian Church. The author was a Cambridge  divine, and one of their Professors of mathematics: \"a science,\"  Goldsmith says, \"to which the meanest intellects are equal.\"    Upon the other hand, we have to consider that view of Tiberius, which is  thus shown by Milton;      _This Emperor hath no son, and now is old;    Old and lascivious: and from Rome retired    To Capreae, an island small but strong,    On the Campanian shore; with purpose there,    His horrid lusts in private to enjoy._    This theme is enlarged by Suetonius, and evidently enjoyed: he  represents Tiberius, as addicted to every established form of vice;  and as the inventor of new names, new modes, and a new convenience, for  unheard-of immoralities. These propensities of the Emperor are handled  by Tacitus with more discretion, though he does not conceal them. I wish  neither to condemn nor to condone Tiberius: I desire, if it be  possible, to see him as he is; and whether he be good or bad, he is very  interesting. I have drawn attention to what is good in \"The Annals,\"  because Tacitus leans with all his weight upon the bad; and either  explains away what is favourable, or passes over it with too light a  stroke. At the end, I must conclude, as I began, that the character of  Tiberius is a mystery. It is a commonplace, that no man is entirely good  nor entirely evil; but the histories of Tiberius are too contradictory,  to be thus dismissed by a platitude. It is not easy to harmonise  Paterculus with Suetonius: it is impossible to reconcile Tacitus with  himself; or to combine the strong, benevolent ruler with the Minotaur of  Capri. The admirers of an almost perfect prose, must be familiar with a  story, which is not the highest effort of that prose: they will remember  a certain man with a double nature, like all of us; but, unlike us,  able to separate his natures, and to personate at will his good or evil  genius. Tiberius was fond of magic, and of the curious arts: it may be,  that he commanded the secrets of which Mr. Stevenson has dreamed!    The readers of \"The Annals\" have seen enough of blood, of crime, and of  Tiberius; and I would now engage their attention upon a more pleasing  aspect of Imperial affairs: I wish to speak about the Empire itself;  about its origin, its form, its history: and, if my powers were equal to  the task, I would sketch a model Emperor; Marcus Aurelius, or the elder  Antonine. Gibbon has described the limits of the Roman Empire; which  \"comprised the fairest part of the earth, and the most civilised portion  of mankind.\" Its boundaries were \"the Rhine and Danube, on the north;  the Euphrates, on the east; towards the south, the sandy deserts of  Arabia and Africa;\" and upon the west, the Atlantic ocean. It was over  this extensive monarchy, that Caesar reigned; by the providence of  Caesar, was the whole defended and administered.      _Quis Parthum paveat? Quis gelidum Scythen    Quis, Germania quos horrida parturit    Fetus, incolumi Caesare?_    The frontiers of the Empire, and its richest provinces, had been  obtained for the most part in the long wars of the Republic. The  conquest of Gaul, and the establishment of the Empire, was achieved  by Julius Caesar; and to him, the civilised world is indebted for that  majestic \"Roman Peace,\" under which it lived and prospered for nearly  nineteen centuries: the Eastern Empire was maintained in Constantinople,  until 1453; and the Empire of the West continued, though in waning  splendour, until the last Caesar abdicated his throne at the order of  Napoleon. The nations of modern Europe were developed out of the ruin  of Caesar's Empire; and from that, the more civilised among them have  obtained the politer share of their laws, their institutions, and their  language: and to Caesar, we are indebted for those inestimable treasures  of antiquity, which the Roman Empire and the Roman Church have preserved  from the barbarians, and have handed on for the delight and the  instruction of modern times. There are those, who can perceive in Caesar  nothing but a demagogue, and a tyrant; and in the regeneration of the  Commonwealth, nothing but a vulgar crime: among these, I am sorry to  inscribe the name of Thomas Gordon. The supporters of this view are  generally misled, by the specious allurements of the term \"Republic.\"  Tiberius, it may be, was not a perfect ruler, and other sovereigns were  even more ferocious; but the excesses of the most reckless Emperor are  hardly to be compared to the wholesale massacres and spoliations,  which attended the last agonies of the expiring Commonwealth. After  the Macedonian and Asiatic wars, we find a turbulent and servile crowd,  instead of the old families and tribes of Roman citizens; instead of  allies, oppressed and plundered provinces; instead of the heroes of the  young Republic, a set of worn-out, lewd, and greedy nobles. By these,  the spoils of the world were appropriated, and its government abused:  Caesar gave the helpless peoples a legal sovereign, and preserved them  from the lawless tyranny of a thousand masters. He narrates himself,  that \"he found the Romans enslaved by a faction, and he restored their  liberty:\" \"Caesar interpellat; ut Populum Romanum, paucorum factione  oppressum, in libertatem vindicat.\" The march of Caesar into Italy was  a triumphal progress; and"]]]
