And those princes  also, endued with great strength, who dressing themselves in deer-skins  learnt the science of weapons under Arjuna, waited upon Yudhishthira.  And O king, the princes also of the Vrishni race, viz., Pradyumna (the  son of Rukmini) and Samva, and Yuyudhana the son of Satyaki and  Sudharman and Aniruddha and Saivya that foremost of men who had learnt  the science of arms under Arjuna these and many other kings, O lord of  the Earth, used to wait on Yudhishthira on that occasion. And that  friend of Dhananjaya, Tumvuru, and the Gandharva Chittasena with his  ministers, any many other Gandharvas and Apsaras, well-skilled in vocal  and instrumental music and in cadence and Kinnaras also well-versed in  (musical) measures and motions singing celestial tunes in proper and  charming voices, waited upon and gladdened the sons of Pandu and the  Rishis who sat in that Sabha. And seated in that Sabha, those bull  among men, of rigid vows and devoted to truth, all waited upon  Yudhishthira like the celestials in heaven waiting upon Brahma.\"      SECTION V    (Lokapala Sabhakhayana Parva)    Vaisampayana said,--\"While the illustrious Pandavas were seated in that  Sabha along with the principal Gandharvas, there came, O Bharata, unto  that assembly the celestial Rishi Narada, conversant with the Vedas and  Upanishadas, worshipped by the celestials acquainted with histories and  Puranas, well-versed in all that occurred in ancient kalpas (cycles),  conversant with Nyaya (logic) and the truth of moral science,  possessing a complete knowledge of the six Angas (viz., pronunciation,  grammar, prosody, explanation of basic terms, description of religious  rites, and astronomy). He was a perfect master in reconciling  contradictory texts and differentiating in applying general principles  to particular cases, as also in interpreting contraries by reference to  differences in situation, eloquent, resolute, intelligent, possessed of  powerful memory. He was acquainted with the science of morals and  politics, learned, proficient in distinguishing inferior things from  superior ones, skilled in drawing inference from evidence, competent to  judge of the correctness or incorrectness of syllogistic statements  consisting of five propositions. He was capable of answering  successively Vrihaspati himself while arguing, with definite  conclusions properly framed about religion, wealth, pleasure and  salvation, of great soul and beholding this whole universe, above,  below, and around, as if it were present before his eyes. He was master  of both the Sankhya and Yoga systems of philosophy, ever desirous of  humbling the celestials and Asuras by fomenting quarrels among them,  conversant with the sciences of war and treaty, proficient in drawing  conclusions by judging of things not within direct ken, as also in the  six sciences of treaty, war, military campaigns, maintenance of posts  against the enemy and stratagems by ambuscades and reserves. He was a  thorough master of every branch of learning, fond of war and music,  incapable of being repulsed by any science or any course of action, and  possessed of these and numberless other accomplishments. The Rishi,  having wandered over the different worlds, came into that Sabha. And  the celestial Rishi of immeasurable splendour, endued with great energy  was accompanied, O monarch, by Parijata and the intelligent Raivata and  Saumya and Sumukha. Possessing the speed of the mind, the Rishi came  thither and was filled with gladness upon beholding the Pandavas. The  Brahmana, on arriving there, paid homage unto Yudhishthira by uttering  blessings on him and wishing him victory. Beholding the learned Rishi  arrive, the eldest of the Pandavas, conversant with all rules of duty,  quickly stood up with his younger brothers. Bending low with humility,  the monarch cheerfully saluted the Rishi, and gave with due ceremonies  a befitting seat unto him. The king also gave him kine and the usual  offerings of the Arghya including honey and the other ingredients.  Conversant with every duty the monarch also worshipped the Rishi with  gems and jewels with a whole heart. Receiving that worship from  Yudhishthira in proper form, the Rishi became gratified. Thus  worshipped by the Pandavas and the great Rishis, Narada possessing a  complete mastery over the Vedas, said unto Yudhishthira the following  words bearing upon religion, wealth, pleasures and salvation.    \"Narada said--'Is the wealth thou art earning being spent on proper  objects? Doth thy mind take pleasure in virtue? Art thou enjoying the  pleasures of life? Doth not thy mind sink under their weight? O chief  of men, continuest thou in the noble conduct consistent with religion  and wealth practised by thy ancestors towards the three classes of  subjects, (viz., good, indifferent, and bad)? Never injurest thou  religion for the sake of wealth, or both religion and wealth for the  sake of pleasure that easily seduces? O thou foremost of victorious men  ever devoted to the good of all, conversant as thou art with the  timeliness of everything, followest thou religion, wealth, pleasure and  salvation dividing thy time judiciously? O sinless one, with the six  attributes of kings (viz., cleverness of speech, readiness in providing  means, intelligence in dealing with the foe, memory, and acquaintance  with morals and politics), dost thou attend to the seven means (viz.,  sowing dissensions, chastisement, conciliation, gifts, incantations,  medicine and magic)? Examinest thou also, after a survey of thy own  strength and weakness, the fourteen possessions of thy foes? These are  the country, forts, cars, elephants, cavalry, foot-soldiers, the  principal officials of state, the zenana, food supply, computations of  the army and income, the religious treatises in force, the accounts of  state, the revenue, wine-shops and other secret enemies. Attendest thou  to the eight occupations (of agriculture, trade, &c), having examined,  O thou foremost of victorious monarchs, thy own and thy enemy's means,  and having made peace with thy enemies? O bull of the Bharata race, thy  seven principal officers of state (viz., the governor of the citadel,  the commander of forces, the chief judge, the general in interior  command, the chief priest, the chief physician, and the chief  astrologer), have not, I hope, succumbed to the influence of thy foes,  nor have they, I hope, become idle in consequence of the wealth they  have earned? They are, I hope, all obedient to thee. Thy counsels, I  hope, are never divulged by thy trusted spies in disguise, by thyself  or by thy ministers? Thou ascertainest, I hope, what thy friends, foes  and strangers are about? Makest thou peace and makest thou war at  proper times? Observest thou neutrality towards strangers and persons  that are neutral towards thee? And, O hero, hast thou made persons like  thyself, persons that are old, continent in behaviour, capable of  understanding what should be done and what should not, pure as regards  birth and blood, and devoted to thee, thy ministers? O Bharata, the  victories of kings can be attributed to good counsels. O child, is thy  kingdom protected by ministers learned in Sastras, keeping their  counsels close? Are thy foes unable to injure it? Thou hast not become  the slave of sleep? Wakest thou at the proper time? Conversant with  pursuits yielding profit, thinkest thou, during the small hours of  night, as to what thou shouldst do and what thou shouldst not do the  next day? Thou settlest nothing alone, nor takest counsels with many?  The counsels thou hast resolved upon, do not become known all over thy  kingdom? Commencest thou soon to accomplish measures of great utility  that are easy of accomplishment? Such measures are never obstructed?  Keepest thou the agriculturists not out of thy sight? They do not fear  to approach thee? Achievest thou thy measures through persons that are  trusted incorruptible, and possessed of practical experience? And, O  brave king, I hope, people only know the measures already accomplished  by thee and those that have been partially accomplished and are  awaiting completion, but not those that are only in contemplation and  uncommenced? Have experienced teachers capable of explaining the causes  of things and learned in the science of morals and every branch of  learning, been appointed to instruct the princes and the chiefs of the  army? Buyest thou a single learned man by giving in exchange a thousand  ignorant individuals? The man that is learned conferreth the greatest  benefit in seasons of distress. Are thy forts always filled with  treasure, food, weapons, water, engines and instruments, as also with  engineers and bowmen? Even a single minister that is intelligent,  brave, with his passions under complete control, and possessed of  wisdom and judgment, is capable of conferring the highest prosperity on  a king or a king's son. I ask thee, therefore, whether there is even  one such minister with thee? Seekest thou to know everything about the  eighteen Tirthas of the foe and fifteen of thy own by means of three  and three spies all unacquainted with one another? O slayer of all  foes, watchest thou all thy enemies with care and attention, and  unknown to them? Is the priest thou honourest, possessed of humility,  and purity of blood, and renown, and without jealousy and illiberality?  Hath any well-behaved, intelligent, and guileless Brahmana, well-up in  the ordinance, been employed by thee in the performance of thy daily  rites before the sacred fire, and doth he remind thee in proper time as  to when thy homa should be performed? Is the astrologer thou hast  employed skilled in reading physiognomy, capable of interpreting omens,  and competent to neutralise the"]]]
