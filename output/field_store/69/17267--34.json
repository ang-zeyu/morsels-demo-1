CHAPTER II    I COME TO MY JOURNEY'S END    On the forenoon of the second day, coming to the top of a hill, I saw  all the country fall away before me down to the sea; and in the midst  of this descent, on a long ridge, the city of Edinburgh smoking like  a kiln. There was a flag upon the castle, and ships moving or lying  anchored in the firth; both of which, for as far away as they were, I  could distinguish clearly; and both brought my country heart into my  mouth.    Presently after, I came by a house where a shepherd lived, and got a  rough direction for the neighbourhood of Cramond; and so, from one to  another, worked my way to the westward of the capital by Colinton, till  I came out upon the Glasgow road. And there, to my great pleasure and  wonder, I beheld a regiment marching to the fifes, every foot in time;  an old red-faced general on a grey horse at the one end, and at the  other the company of Grenadiers, with their Pope's-hats. The pride of  life seemed to mount into my brain at the sight of the red coats and the  hearing of that merry music.    A little farther on, and I was told I was in Cramond parish, and began  to substitute in my inquiries the name of the house of Shaws. It was a  word that seemed to surprise those of whom I sought my way. At first I  thought the plainness of my appearance, in my country habit, and that  all dusty from the road, consorted ill with the greatness of the place  to which I was bound. But after two, or maybe three, had given me the  same look and the same answer, I began to take it in my head there was  something strange about the Shaws itself.    The better to set this fear at rest, I changed the form of my inquiries;  and spying an honest fellow coming along a lane on the shaft of his  cart, I asked him if he had ever heard tell of a house they called the  house of Shaws.    He stopped his cart and looked at me, like the others.    \"Ay\" said he. \"What for?\"    \"It's a great house?\" I asked.    \"Doubtless,\" says he. \"The house is a big, muckle house.\"    \"Ay,\" said I, \"but the folk that are in it?\"    \"Folk?\" cried he. \"Are ye daft? There's nae folk there--to call folk.\"    \"What?\" say I; \"not Mr. Ebenezer?\"    \"Ou, ay\" says the man; \"there's the laird, to be sure, if it's him  you're wanting. What'll like be your business, mannie?\"    \"I was led to think that I would get a situation,\" I said, looking as  modest as I could.    \"What?\" cries the carter, in so sharp a note that his very horse  started; and then, \"Well, mannie,\" he added, \"it's nane of my affairs;  but ye seem a decent-spoken lad; and if ye'll take a word from me, ye'll  keep clear of the Shaws.\"    The next person I came across was a dapper little man in a beautiful  white wig, whom I saw to be a barber on his rounds; and knowing well  that barbers were great gossips, I asked him plainly what sort of a man  was Mr. Balfour of the Shaws.    \"Hoot, hoot, hoot,\" said the barber, \"nae kind of a man, nae kind of a  man at all;\" and began to ask me very shrewdly what my business was;  but I was more than a match for him at that, and he went on to his next  customer no wiser than he came.    I cannot well describe the blow this dealt to my illusions. The more  indistinct the accusations were, the less I liked them, for they left  the wider field to fancy. What kind of a great house was this, that all  the parish should start and stare to be asked the way to it? or what  sort of a gentleman, that his ill-fame should be thus current on the  wayside? If an hour's walking would have brought me back to Essendean, I  had left my adventure then and there, and returned to Mr. Campbell's.  But when I had come so far a way already, mere shame would not suffer me  to desist till I had put the matter to the touch of proof; I was bound,  out of mere self-respect, to carry it through; and little as I liked  the sound of what I heard, and slow as I began to travel, I still kept  asking my way and still kept advancing.    It was drawing on to sundown when I met a stout, dark, sour-looking  woman coming trudging down a hill; and she, when I had put my usual  question, turned sharp about, accompanied me back to the summit she had  just left, and pointed to a great bulk of building standing very bare  upon a green in the bottom of the next valley. The country was pleasant  round about, running in low hills, pleasantly watered and wooded, and  the crops, to my eyes, wonderfully good; but the house itself appeared  to be a kind of ruin; no road led up to it; no smoke arose from any of  the chimneys; nor was there any semblance of a garden. My heart sank.  \"That!\" I cried.    The woman's face lit up with a malignant anger. \"That is the house of  Shaws!\" she cried. \"Blood built it; blood stopped the building of it;  blood shall bring it down. See here!\" she cried again--\"I spit upon  the ground, and crack my thumb at it! Black be its fall! If ye see the  laird, tell him what ye hear; tell him this makes the twelve hunner and  nineteen time that Jennet Clouston has called down the curse on him  and his house, byre and stable, man, guest, and master, wife, miss, or  bairn--black, black be their fall!\"    And the woman, whose voice had risen to a kind of eldritch sing-song,  turned with a skip, and was gone. I stood where she left me, with my  hair on end. In those days folk still believed in witches and trembled  at a curse; and this one, falling so pat, like a wayside omen, to arrest  me ere I carried out my purpose, took the pith out of my legs.    I sat me down and stared at the house of Shaws. The more I looked,  the pleasanter that country-side appeared; being all set with hawthorn  bushes full of flowers; the fields dotted with sheep; a fine flight of  rooks in the sky; and every sign of a kind soil and climate; and yet the  barrack in the midst of it went sore against my fancy.    Country folk went by from the fields as I sat there on the side of the  ditch, but I lacked the spirit to give them a good-e'en. At last the sun  went down, and then, right up against the yellow sky, I saw a scroll of  smoke go mounting, not much thicker, as it seemed to me, than the smoke  of a candle; but still there it was, and meant a fire, and warmth, and  cookery, and some living inhabitant that must have lit it; and this  comforted my heart.    So I set forward by a little faint track in the grass that led in my  direction. It was very faint indeed to be the only way to a place  of habitation; yet I saw no other. Presently it brought me to stone  uprights, with an unroofed lodge beside them, and coats of arms upon  the top. A main entrance it was plainly meant to be, but never finished;  instead of gates of wrought iron, a pair of hurdles were tied across  with a straw rope; and as there were no park walls, nor any sign of  avenue, the track that I was following passed on the right hand of the  pillars, and went wandering on toward the house.    The nearer I got to that, the drearier it appeared. It seemed like the  one wing of a house that had never been finished. What should have been  the inner end stood open on the upper floors, and showed against the sky  with steps and stairs of uncompleted masonry. Many of the windows were  unglazed, and bats flew in and out like doves out of a dove-cote.    The night had begun to fall as I got close; and in three of the lower  windows, which were very high up and narrow, and well barred, the  changing light of a little fire began to glimmer. Was this the palace  I had been coming to? Was it within these walls that I was to seek  new friends and begin great fortunes? Why, in my father's house on  Essen-Waterside, the fire and the bright lights would show a mile away,  and the door open to a beggar's knock!    I came forward cautiously, and giving ear as I came, heard some one  rattling with dishes, and a little dry, eager cough that came in fits;  but there was no sound of speech, and not a dog barked.    The door, as well as I could see it in the dim light, was a great piece  of wood all studded with nails; and I lifted my hand with a faint heart  under my jacket, and knocked once. Then I stood and waited. The house  had fallen into a dead silence; a whole minute passed away, and nothing  stirred but the bats overhead. I knocked again, and hearkened again.  By this time my ears had grown so accustomed to the quiet, that I  could hear the ticking of the clock inside as it slowly counted out the  seconds; but whoever was in that house kept deadly still, and must have  held his breath.    I was in two minds whether to run away; but anger got the upper hand,  and I began instead to rain kicks and buffets on the door, and to shout  out aloud for Mr. Balfour. I was in full career, when I heard the cough  right overhead, and jumping back and looking up, beheld a man's head  in a tall nightcap, and the bell mouth of a blunderbuss, at one of the  first-storey windows.    \"It's loaded,\" said a voice.    \"I have come here with a letter,\" I said, \"to Mr. Ebenezer Balfour of  Shaws. Is he here?\"    \"From whom is it?\" asked the man with the blunderbuss.    \"That is neither here nor there,\" said I, for I was growing very wroth.    \"Well,\" was the reply, \"ye can put it down upon the doorstep, and be off  with ye.\"    \"I will do no such thing,\" I cried. \"I will deliver it into Mr.  Balfour's hands, as it was meant I should. It is a letter of  introduction.\"    \"A what?\" cried the voice, sharply.    I repeated what I had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4210"],[0,"Our War with Spain for Cuba's Freedom (#3)"],[1,"phrase,  \"the star-spangled banner,\" than are the people of Spain to the  people of the United States.    \"REMEMBER THE MAINE.\"    From the day of the outbreak of the Cuban revolution, early in  1895, until nearly the end of January, 1898, there had been no  flag of the United States seen in any harbor of Cuba except upon  merchant vessels. Always before, it had been the policy of our  government to have ships of war make friendly calls in the harbors  of all countries of the world at frequent intervals, and Cuban  waters had shared these courtesies.    So careful were the officers of the Cleveland administration to  avoid the appearance of offense or threat against the authority of  Spain, with which we were living in amity, that immediately upon  the outbreak of hostilities in Cuba this practice was suspended,  so far as it applied to that island. Our ships cruised through the  oceans of the world and called at all ports where they were not  needed, but the waters of Havana harbor for three years were never  disturbed by an American keel.    Out of deference to the expressed wishes of the local Spanish  authorities in Havana, Dr. Burgess, the splendid surgeon of the  United States Marine Hospital service in Havana, who for thirty  years has guarded our southern ports from the epidemics of yellow  fever and smallpox, which would invade us annually as a result of  Spanish misgovernment in Cuba, except for his watchfulness, ceased  flying the American flag on his steam launch, by means of which he  carried out his official duties in those foul waters. The American  flag was a disturbing influence upon the minds of the Cubans who  might see it flashing in the clear sunlight of the tropic sky,  suggested the Captain General.    It must have been the language of diplomacy that was in mind, when  the satirist explained that \"language was intended as a medium for  concealing thought.\" President McKinley, in his message to  Congress transmitting the report of the naval board concerning the  catastrophe to the Maine, explained that for some time prior to  the visit of the battle-ship to Havana harbor, it had been  considered a proper change in the policy, in order to accustom the  people to the presence of our flag as a symbol of good will. The  decision to send the vessel to that harbor was reached, it was  explained, after conference with the Spanish minister, and,  through our diplomats, with the Spanish authorities at Madrid and  Havana. It was declared that this intention was received by the  Spanish government with high appreciation of the courtesy  intended, which it was offered to return by sending Spanish ships  to the principal ports of the United States.    We are bound to accept this expression from the officials on both  sides as frankly indicative of their feelings. But it is just as  necessary to recognize that to the mass of the people in both  countries, the significance of the Maine's courtesy call was very  different. Americans believed that it indicated a changed policy  on the part of the national government at Washington which would  be more strenuous and more prompt in resenting outrages against  the life and property of American citizens in Cuba. The people of  the Cuban republic believed that the change meant an expression of  sympathy and friendship for their cause, with probable  interference in their behalf, and took courage from that sign.  Finally, the people of Spain resented the appearance of the Maine  in the harbor of Havana as an affront, and a direct threat against  them and in favor of the insurgents. If the policy of making  frequent calls in warships had never been interrupted, they would  not have had this sentiment in the matter, but the resumption of  the practice after three years' cessation, carried a threat with  it in their minds.    TREACHEROUS DESTRUCTION OF THE MAINE.    The Maine entered the harbor of Havana at sunrise on the 25th of  January and was anchored at a place indicated by the harbor-master.  Her arrival was marked with no special incident, except  the exchange of customary salutes and ceremonial visits. Three  weeks from that night, at forty minutes past nine o'clock in the  evening of the 15th of February, the Maine was destroyed by an  explosion, by which the entire forward part of the ship was  wrecked. In this frightful catastrophe 264 of her crew and two  officers perished, those who were not killed outright by the  explosion being penned between decks by the tangle of wreckage and  drowned by the immediate sinking of her hull.    In spite of the fact that the American public was urged to suspend  judgment as to the causes of this disaster, and that the Spanish  authorities in Havana and in Madrid expressed grief and sympathy,  it, was impossible to subdue a general belief that in some way  Spanish treachery was responsible for the calamity. With the  history of Spanish cruelty in Cuba before them, and the memory of  Spanish barbarities through all their existence as a nation, the  people could mot disabuse their minds of this suspicion.    One month later this popular judgment was verified by the finding  of the naval court of inquiry which had made an exhaustive  examination of the wreck, and had taken testimony from every  available source. With this confirmation and the aroused sentiment  of the country concerning conditions in Cuba, the logic of events  was irresistibly drawing the country toward war with Spain, and  all efforts of diplomacy and expressions of polite regard  exchanged between the governments of the two nations were unable  to avert it.    For a few weeks, history was made rapidly. Conservative and  eminent American senators visited Cuba in order to obtain personal  information of conditions there, and upon their return, gave to  Congress and to the country, in eloquent speeches, the story of  the sufferings they had found in that unhappy island. The loss of  the Maine had focused American attention upon the Cuban situation  as it had never been before, and though there were no more reasons  for sympathetic interference than there had been for many months,  people began to realize as they had not before, the horrors that  were being enacted at their thresholds.    The sailors who died with the Maine, even though they were not  able to fight their country's foes, have not died in vain, for it  is their death that will be remembered as the culminating  influence for American intervention and the salvation of scores of  thousands of lives of starving Cuban women and children. Vessels  were loaded with supplies of provisions and clothing for the  suffering and were sent to the harbors of Cuba, where distribution  was made by Miss Clara Barton and her trusted associates in the  American National Red Cross. Some of these vessels were merchant  steamers, but others were American cruisers, and Cubans were not  permitted to forget that there was a flag which typified liberty,  not far away. The strain upon the national patience increased  every day, and was nearing the breaking point.    PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS ACT.    After a period of restlessness in Congress which was shared by the  whole country, the President finally transmitted an important  message. It included a resume of the progress of the Cuban  revolution from its beginning and considered in some detail the  workings of that devastating policy of General Weyler, known as  reconcentration. The message related the progress of diplomatic  negotiations with Spain, and disclosed a surprising succession of  events in which the Spanish government had submitted to various  requests and recommendations of the American government. The  message ended with a request that Congress authorize and empower  the President to take measures to secure a full and final  termination of the intolerable conditions on the island of Cuba.  Having exhausted the powers of the executive in these efforts, it  was left to the legislative authority of the American people to  establish such policies as would be finally efficient.    Congress rose to the occasion. The facts were at command of both  houses, their sympathies were enlisted at the side of their reason  and there was little time lost in acting. The House and the  Senate, after mutual concessions on minor details, passed as a law  of the land for the President's signature, an act directing him  and empowering him to require Spain to withdraw her troops and  relinquish all authority over the island of Cuba. The President  was authorized to employ the army and navy of the United States  for the purpose of carrying into effect this instruction and the  interference was directed to be made at once. Best of all, from  the point of view of the Cuban patriots, the act declared that the  people of Cuba are and ought to be free and independent. But a few  days more of diplomacy, and war was to begin.    SPAIN DEFIES AMERICA.    It was hardly to be expected that the Spanish government and the  Spanish people would yield to the demands of the United States  without a protest. So feeble is the hold of the present dynasty  upon the throne of Spain, that it was readily understood that any  concession upon the part of the Queen Regent would arouse Spanish  indignation beyond the limits of endurance. The Queen-mother had  to think of her baby son's crown. If she were to yield to the  superior power of the United States without a struggle, Spanish  revolutionists would overthrow the dynasty before he could come to  the throne. However well she might know that the logical outcome  of a war would be overwhelming defeat to Spanish arms, political  necessities compelled her to take the position dictated by Spanish  pride.    The Spanish Cortes met in special session at Madrid, and on the  20th of April the Queen Regent delivered her speech before that  legislative body and declared that her parliament was summoned in  the hour of peril to defend her country's"]]]
