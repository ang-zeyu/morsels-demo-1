His picture, in an ornate frame, always graced our family altar in  the various cities to which Father was transferred by his office.  Many a morning and evening found Mother and me meditating before an  improvised shrine, offering flowers dipped in fragrant sandalwood  paste. With frankincense and myrrh as well as our united devotions,  we honored the divinity which had found full expression in Lahiri  Mahasaya.    His picture had a surpassing influence over my life. As I grew,  the thought of the master grew with me. In meditation I would often  see his photographic image emerge from its small frame and, taking  a living form, sit before me. When I attempted to touch the feet  of his luminous body, it would change and again become the picture.  As childhood slipped into boyhood, I found Lahiri Mahasaya transformed  in my mind from a little image, cribbed in a frame, to a living,  enlightening presence. I frequently prayed to him in moments of  trial or confusion, finding within me his solacing direction. At  first I grieved because he was no longer physically living. As I  began to discover his secret omnipresence, I lamented no more. He  had often written to those of his disciples who were over-anxious  to see him: \"Why come to view my bones and flesh, when I am ever  within range of your KUTASTHA (spiritual sight)?\"    I was blessed about the age of eight with a wonderful healing  through the photograph of Lahiri Mahasaya. This experience gave  intensification to my love. While at our family estate in Ichapur,  Bengal, I was stricken with Asiatic cholera. My life was despaired  of; the doctors could do nothing. At my bedside, Mother frantically  motioned me to look at Lahiri Mahasaya's picture on the wall above  my head.    \"Bow to him mentally!\" She knew I was too feeble even to lift my  hands in salutation. \"If you really show your devotion and inwardly  kneel before him, your life will be spared!\"    I gazed at his photograph and saw there a blinding light, enveloping  my body and the entire room. My nausea and other uncontrollable  symptoms disappeared; I was well. At once I felt strong enough to  bend over and touch Mother's feet in appreciation of her immeasurable  faith in her guru. Mother pressed her head repeatedly against the  little picture.    \"O Omnipresent Master, I thank thee that thy light hath healed my  son!\"    I realized that she too had witnessed the luminous blaze through  which I had instantly recovered from a usually fatal disease.    One of my most precious possessions is that same photograph. Given  to Father by Lahiri Mahasaya himself, it carries a holy vibration.  The picture had a miraculous origin. I heard the story from Father's  brother disciple, Kali Kumar Roy.    It appears that the master had an aversion to being photographed.  Over his protest, a group picture was once taken of him and  a cluster of devotees, including Kali Kumar Roy. It was an amazed  photographer who discovered that the plate which had clear images  of all the disciples, revealed nothing more than a blank space in  the center where he had reasonably expected to find the outlines  of Lahiri Mahasaya. The phenomenon was widely discussed.    A certain student and expert photographer, Ganga Dhar Babu, boasted  that the fugitive figure would not escape him. The next morning,  as the guru sat in lotus posture on a wooden bench with a screen  behind him, Ganga Dhar Babu arrived with his equipment. Taking every  precaution for success, he greedily exposed twelve plates. On each  one he soon found the imprint of the wooden bench and screen, but  once again the master's form was missing.    With tears and shattered pride, Ganga Dhar Babu sought out his  guru.  It was many hours before Lahiri Mahasaya broke his silence  with a pregnant comment:    \"I am Spirit. Can your camera reflect the omnipresent Invisible?\"    \"I see it cannot! But, Holy Sir, I lovingly desire a picture of  the bodily temple where alone, to my narrow vision, that Spirit  appears fully to dwell.\"    \"Come, then, tomorrow morning. I will pose for you.\"    Again the photographer focused his camera. This time the sacred  figure, not cloaked with mysterious imperceptibility, was sharp on  the plate. The master never posed for another picture; at least,  I have seen none.    The photograph is reproduced in this book. Lahiri Mahasaya's fair  features, of a universal cast, hardly suggest to what race he  belonged. His intense joy of God-communion is slightly revealed in  a somewhat enigmatic smile. His eyes, half open to denote a nominal  direction on the outer world, are half closed also. Completely  oblivious to the poor lures of the earth, he was fully awake at  all times to the spiritual problems of seekers who approached for  his bounty.    Shortly after my healing through the potency of the guru's picture,  I had an influential spiritual vision. Sitting on my bed one morning,  I fell into a deep reverie.    \"What is behind the darkness of closed eyes?\" This probing thought  came powerfully into my mind. An immense flash of light at once  manifested to my inward gaze. Divine shapes of saints, sitting in  meditation posture in mountain caves, formed like miniature cinema  pictures on the large screen of radiance within my forehead.    \"Who are you?\" I spoke aloud.    \"We are the Himalayan yogis.\" The celestial response is difficult  to describe; my heart was thrilled.    \"Ah, I long to go to the Himalayas and become like you!\" The vision  vanished, but the silvery beams expanded in ever-widening circles  to infinity.    \"What is this wondrous glow?\"    \"I am Iswara.{FN1-11} I am Light.\" The voice was as murmuring  clouds.    \"I want to be one with Thee!\"    Out of the slow dwindling of my divine ecstasy, I salvaged a permanent  legacy of inspiration to seek God. \"He is eternal, ever-new Joy!\"  This memory persisted long after the day of rapture.    Another early recollection is outstanding; and literally so, for  I bear the scar to this day. My elder sister Uma and I were seated  in the early morning under a NEEM tree in our Gorakhpur compound.  She was helping me with a Bengali primer, what time I could spare  my gaze from the near-by parrots eating ripe margosa fruit. Uma  complained of a boil on her leg, and fetched a jar of ointment. I  smeared a bit of the salve on my forearm.    \"Why do you use medicine on a healthy arm?\"    \"Well, Sis, I feel I am going to have a boil tomorrow. I am testing  your ointment on the spot where the boil will appear.\"    \"You little liar!\"    \"Sis, don't call me a liar until you see what happens in the  morning.\" Indignation filled me.    Uma was unimpressed, and thrice repeated her taunt. An adamant  resolution sounded in my voice as I made slow reply.    \"By the power of will in me, I say that tomorrow I shall have  a fairly large boil in this exact place on my arm; and YOUR boil  shall swell to twice its present size!\"    Morning found me with a stalwart boil on the indicated spot; the  dimensions of Uma's boil had doubled. With a shriek, my sister  rushed to Mother. \"Mukunda has become a necromancer!\" Gravely,  Mother instructed me never to use the power of words for doing  harm. I have always remembered her counsel, and followed it.    My boil was surgically treated. A noticeable scar, left by  the doctor's incision, is present today. On my right forearm is a  constant reminder of the power in man's sheer word.    Those simple and apparently harmless phrases to Uma, spoken  with deep concentration, had possessed sufficient hidden force to  explode like bombs and produce definite, though injurious, effects.  I understood, later, that the explosive vibratory power in speech  could be wisely directed to free one's life from difficulties, and  thus operate without scar or rebuke. {FN1-12}    Our family moved to Lahore in the Punjab. There I acquired a picture  of the Divine Mother in the form of the Goddess Kali. {FN1-13} It  sanctified a small informal shrine on the balcony of our home. An  unequivocal conviction came over me that fulfillment would crown any  of my prayers uttered in that sacred spot. Standing there with Uma  one day, I watched two kites flying over the roofs of the buildings  on the opposite side of the very narrow lane.    \"Why are you so quiet?\" Uma pushed me playfully.    \"I am just thinking how wonderful it is that Divine Mother gives  me whatever I ask.\"    \"I suppose She would give you those two kites!\" My sister laughed  derisively.    \"Why not?\" I began silent prayers for their possession.    Matches are played in India with kites whose strings are covered  with glue and ground glass. Each player attempts to sever the string  of his opponent. A freed kite sails over the roofs; there is great  fun in catching it. Inasmuch as Uma and I were on the balcony, it  seemed impossible that any loosed kite could come into our hands;  its string would naturally dangle over the roofs.    The players across the lane began their match. One string was cut;  immediately the kite floated in my direction. It was stationary  for a moment, through sudden abatement of breeze, which sufficed  to firmly entangle the string with a cactus plant on top of the  opposite house.  A perfect loop was formed for my seizure. I handed  the prize to Uma.    \"It was just an extraordinary accident, and not an answer to your  prayer. If the other kite comes to you, then I shall believe.\"  Sister's dark eyes conveyed more amazement than her words.    I continued my prayers with a crescendo intensity. A forcible tug  by the other player resulted in the abrupt loss of his kite. It  headed toward me, dancing in the wind. My helpful assistant, the  cactus plant, again secured the kite string in the necessary loop  by which I could grasp it. I presented my second trophy to Uma.    \"Indeed, Divine Mother listens to you! This is all too uncanny"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7471"],[0,"The Man with Two Left Feet, and Other Stories (#3)"],[1,"  he butted his way through the crowd and seized her hand  enthusiastically.    'Why, Henry! Where did you come from?'    'I _am_ glad to see you!'    'How did you get here?'    'I _am_ glad to see you!'    At this point the stage-manager, bellowing from the prompt-box, urged  Henry to desist. It is one of the mysteries of behind-the-scenes  acoustics that a whisper from any minor member of the company can be  heard all over the house, while the stage-manager can burst himself  without annoying the audience.    Henry, awed by authority, relapsed into silence. From the unseen stage  came the sound of someone singing a song about the moon. June was also  mentioned. He recognized the song as one that had always bored him. He  disliked the woman who was singing it--a Miss Clarice Weaver, who  played the heroine of the piece to Sidney Crane's hero.    In his opinion he was not alone. Miss Weaver was not popular in the  company. She had secured the role rather as a testimony of personal  esteem from the management than because of any innate ability. She sang  badly, acted indifferently, and was uncertain what to do with her  hands. All these things might have been forgiven her, but she  supplemented them by the crime known in stage circles as 'throwing her  weight about'. That is to say, she was hard to please, and, when not  pleased, apt to say so in no uncertain voice. To his personal friends  Walter Jelliffe had frequently confided that, though not a rich man, he  was in the market with a substantial reward for anyone who was man  enough to drop a ton of iron on Miss Weaver.    Tonight the song annoyed Henry more than usual, for he knew that very  soon the daffodils were due on the stage to clinch the verisimilitude  of the scene by dancing the tango with the rabbits. He endeavoured to  make the most of the time at his disposal.    'I _am_ glad to see you!' he said.    'Sh-h!' said the stage-manager.    Henry was discouraged. Romeo could not have made love under these  conditions. And then, just when he was pulling himself together to  begin again, she was torn from him by the exigencies of the play.    He wandered moodily off into the dusty semi-darkness. He avoided the  prompt-box, whence he could have caught a glimpse of her, being loath  to meet the stage-manager just at present.    Walter Jelliffe came up to him, as he sat on a box and brooded on life.    'A little less of the double forte, old man,' he said. 'Miss Weaver has  been kicking about the noise on the side. She wanted you thrown out,  but I said you were my mascot, and I would die sooner than part with  you. But I should go easy on the chest-notes, I think, all the same.'    Henry nodded moodily. He was depressed. He had the feeling, which comes  so easily to the intruder behind the scenes, that nobody loved him.    The piece proceeded. From the front of the house roars of laughter  indicated the presence on the stage of Walter Jelliffe, while now and  then a lethargic silence suggested that Miss Clarice Weaver was in  action. From time to time the empty space about him filled with girls  dressed in accordance with the exuberant fancy of the producer of the  piece. When this happened, Henry would leap from his seat and endeavour  to locate Alice; but always, just as he thought he had done so, the  hidden orchestra would burst into melody and the chorus would be called  to the front.    It was not till late in the second act that he found an opportunity for  further speech.    The plot of 'The Girl From Brighton' had by then reached a critical  stage. The situation was as follows: The hero, having been disinherited  by his wealthy and titled father for falling in love with the heroine,  a poor shop-girl, has disguised himself (by wearing a different  coloured necktie) and has come in pursuit of her to a well-known  seaside resort, where, having disguised herself by changing her dress,  she is serving as a waitress in the Rotunda, on the Esplanade. The  family butler, disguised as a Bath-chair man, has followed the hero,  and the wealthy and titled father, disguised as an Italian  opera-singer, has come to the place for a reason which, though  extremely sound, for the moment eludes the memory. Anyhow, he is there,  and they all meet on the Esplanade. Each recognizes the other, but  thinks he himself is unrecognized. _Exeunt_ all, hurriedly,  leaving the heroine alone on the stage.    It is a crisis in the heroine's life. She meets it bravely. She sings a  song entitled 'My Honolulu Queen', with chorus of Japanese girls and  Bulgarian officers.    Alice was one of the Japanese girls.    She was standing a little apart from the other Japanese girls. Henry  was on her with a bound. Now was his time. He felt keyed up, full of  persuasive words. In the interval which had elapsed since their last  conversation yeasty emotions had been playing the dickens with his  self-control. It is practically impossible for a novice, suddenly  introduced behind the scenes of a musical comedy, not to fall in love  with somebody; and, if he is already in love, his fervour is increased  to a dangerous point.    Henry felt that it was now or never. He forgot that it was perfectly  possible--indeed, the reasonable course--to wait till the performance  was over, and renew his appeal to Alice to marry him on the way back to  her hotel. He had the feeling that he had got just about a quarter of a  minute. Quick action! That was Henry's slogan.    He seized her hand.    'Alice!'    'Sh-h!' hissed the stage-manager.    'Listen! I love you. I'm crazy about you. What does it matter whether  I'm on the stage or not? I love you.'    'Stop that row there!'    'Won't you marry me?'    She looked at him. It seemed to him that she hesitated.    'Cut it out!' bellowed the stage-manager, and Henry cut it out.    And at this moment, when his whole fate hung in the balance, there came  from the stage that devastating high note which is the sign that the  solo is over and that the chorus are now about to mobilize. As if drawn  by some magnetic power, she suddenly receded from him, and went on to  the stage.    A man in Henry's position and frame of mind is not responsible for his  actions. He saw nothing but her; he was blind to the fact that  important manoeuvres were in progress. All he understood was that she  was going from him, and that he must stop her and get this thing  settled.    He clutched at her. She was out of range, and getting farther away  every instant.    He sprang forward.    The advice that should be given to every young man starting life is--if  you happen to be behind the scenes at a theatre, never spring forward.  The whole architecture of the place is designed to undo those who so  spring. Hours before, the stage-carpenters have laid their traps, and  in the semi-darkness you cannot but fall into them.    The trap into which Henry fell was a raised board. It was not a very  highly-raised board. It was not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a  church-door, but 'twas enough--it served. Stubbing it squarely with his  toe, Henry shot forward, all arms and legs.    It is the instinct of Man, in such a situation, to grab at the nearest  support. Henry grabbed at the Hotel Superba, the pride of the  Esplanade. It was a thin wooden edifice, and it supported him for  perhaps a tenth of a second. Then he staggered with it into the  limelight, tripped over a Bulgarian officer who was inflating himself  for a deep note, and finally fell in a complicated heap as exactly in  the centre of the stage as if he had been a star of years' standing.    It went well; there was no question of that. Previous audiences had  always been rather cold towards this particular song, but this one got  on its feet and yelled for more. From all over the house came rapturous  demands that Henry should go back and do it again.    But Henry was giving no encores. He rose to his feet, a little stunned,  and automatically began to dust his clothes. The orchestra, unnerved by  this unrehearsed infusion of new business, had stopped playing.  Bulgarian officers and Japanese girls alike seemed unequal to the  situation. They stood about, waiting for the next thing to break loose.  From somewhere far away came faintly the voice of the stage-manager  inventing new words, new combinations of words, and new throat noises.    And then Henry, massaging a stricken elbow, was aware of Miss Weaver at  his side. Looking up, he caught Miss Weaver's eye.    A familiar stage-direction of melodrama reads, 'Exit cautious through  gap in hedge'. It was Henry's first appearance on any stage, but he did  it like a veteran.    'My dear fellow,' said Walter Jelliffe. The hour was midnight, and he  was sitting in Henry's bedroom at the hotel. Leaving the theatre, Henry  had gone to bed almost instinctively. Bed seemed the only haven for  him. 'My dear fellow, don't apologize. You have put me under lasting  obligations. In the first place, with your unerring sense of the stage,  you saw just the spot where the piece needed livening up, and you  livened it up. That was good; but far better was it that you also sent  our Miss Weaver into violent hysterics, from which she emerged to hand  in her notice. She leaves us tomorrow.'    Henry was appalled at the extent of the disaster for which he was  responsible.    'What will you do?'    'Do! Why, it's what we have all been praying for--a miracle which  should eject Miss Weaver. It needed a genius like you to come to bring  it off. Sidney Crane's wife can play the part without rehearsal. She  understudied it all last season in London. Crane has just been speaking  to her on the phone, and she is catching the night express.'    Henry sat up in bed.    'What!'    'What's the trouble now?'    'Sidney Crane's wife?'    'What about her?'    A bleakness fell upon Henry's soul.    'She was the woman who was employing me. Now I shall be taken off the  job and have to go back to London.'    'You"]]]
