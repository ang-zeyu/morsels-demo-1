Then he narrated his devices to get into the house at night and obtain  some food, how a dog flew at him, how the whole household, black and  white, rose in pursuit, how he scrambled under a hedge and over a high  fence, etc., all in a style of which Gough alone among orators can give  the faintest impression, so thoroughly dramatized was every syllable.    Then he described his reaching the river-side at last, and trying to  decide whether certain vessels held friends or foes.    \"Den I see guns on board, and sure sartin he Union boat, and I pop my  head up. Den I been-a-tink [think] Seceshkey hab guns too, and my head  go down again. Den I hide in de bush till morning. Den I open my bundle,  and take ole white shut and tie him on ole pole and wave him, and  ebry time de wind blow, I been-a-tremble, and drap down in de bushes,\"  because, being between two fires, he doubted whether friend or foe would  see his signal first. And so on, with a succession of tricks beyond  Moliere, of acts of caution, foresight, patient cunning, which were  listened to with infinite gusto and perfect comprehension by every  listener.    And all this to a bivouac of negro soldiers, with the brilliant fire  lighting up their red trousers and gleaming from their shining black  faces, eyes and teeth all white with tumultuous glee. Overhead, the  mighty limbs of a great live-oak, with the weird moss swaying in the  smoke, and the high moon gleaming faintly through.    Yet to-morrow strangers will remark on the hopeless, impenetrable  stupidity in the daylight faces of many of these very men, the solid  mask under which Nature has concealed all this wealth of mother-wit.  This very comedian is one to whom one might point, as he hoed lazily  in a cotton-field, as a being the light of whose brain had utterly gone  out; and this scene seems like coming by night upon some conclave  of black beetles, and finding them engaged, with green-room and  foot-lights, in enacting \"Poor Pillicoddy.\" This is their university;  every young Sambo before me, as he turned over the sweet potatoes and  peanuts which were roasting in the ashes, listened with reverence to  the wiles of the ancient Ulysses, and meditated the same. It is Nature's  compensation; oppression simply crushes the upper faculties of the head,  and crowds everything into the perceptive organs. Cato, thou reasonest  well! When I get into any serious scrape, in an enemy's country, may I  be lucky enough to have you at my elbow, to pull me out of it!    The men seem to have enjoyed the novel event of Thanksgiving-Day; they  have had company and regimental prize-shootings, a minimum of speeches  and a maximum of dinner. Bill of fare: two beef-cattle and a thousand  oranges. The oranges cost a cent apiece, and the cattle were Secesh,  bestowed by General Saxby, as they all call him.      December 1, 1862.    How absurd is the impression bequeathed by Slavery in regard to these  Southern blacks, that they are sluggish and inefficient in labor! Last  night, after a hard day's work (our guns and the remainder of our tents  being just issued), an order came from Beaufort that we should be ready  in the evening to unload a steamboat's cargo of boards, being some of  those captured by them a few weeks since, and now assigned for their  use. I wondered if the men would grumble at the night-work; but the  steamboat arrived by seven, and it was bright moonlight when they went  at it. Never have I beheld such a jolly scene of labor. Tugging these  wet and heavy boards over a bridge of boats ashore, then across the  slimy beach at low tide, then up a steep bank, and all in one great  uproar of merriment for two hours. Running most of the time, chattering  all the time, snatching the boards from each other's backs as if they  were some coveted treasure, getting up eager rivalries between different  companies, pouring great choruses of ridicule on the heads of all  shirkers, they made the whole scene so enlivening that I gladly stayed  out in the moonlight for the whole time to watch it. And all this  without any urging or any promised reward, but simply as the most  natural way of doing the thing. The steamboat captain declared that they  unloaded the ten thousand feet of boards quicker than any white gang  could have done it; and they felt it so little, that, when, later in the  night, I reproached one whom I found sitting by a campfire, cooking a  surreptitious opossum, telling him that he ought to be asleep after such  a job of work, he answered, with the broadest grin, \"O no, Gunnel, da's  no work at all, Gunnel; dat only jess enough for stretch we.\"      December 2, 1862.    I believe I have not yet enumerated the probable drawbacks to the  success of this regiment, if any. We are exposed to no direct annoyance  from the white regiments, being out of their way; and we have as yet no  discomforts or privations which we do not share with them. I do not as  yet see the slightest obstacle, in the nature of the blacks, to making  them good soldiers, but rather the contrary. They take readily to  drill, and do not object to discipline; they are not especially dull  or inattentive; they seem fully to understand the importance of the  contest, and of their share in it. They show no jealousy or suspicion  towards their officers.    They do show these feelings, however, towards the Government itself; and  no one can wonder. Here lies the drawback to rapid recruiting. Were  this a wholly new regiment, it would have been full to overflowing, I  am satisfied, ere now. The trouble is in the legacy of bitter distrust  bequeathed by the abortive regiment of General Hunter, into which they  were driven like cattle, kept for several months in camp, and then  turned off without a shilling, by order of the War Department. The  formation of that regiment was, on the whole, a great injury to this  one; and the men who came from it, though the best soldiers we have in  other respects, are the least sanguine and cheerful; while those who  now refuse to enlist have a great influence in deterring others. Our  soldiers are constantly twitted by their families and friends with their  prospect of risking their lives in the service, and being paid nothing;  and it is in vain that we read them the instructions of the Secretary  of War to General Saxton, promising them the full pay of soldiers. They  only half believe it.*    *With what utter humiliation were we, their officers, obliged to confess  to them, eighteen months afterwards, that it was their distrust which  was wise, and our faith in the pledges of the United States Government  which was foolishness!    Another drawback is that some of the white soldiers delight in  frightening the women on the plantations with doleful tales of plans for  putting us in the front rank in all battles, and such silly talk,--the  object being perhaps, to prevent our being employed on active service  at all. All these considerations they feel precisely as white men  would,--no less, no more; and it is the comparative freedom from such  unfavorable influences which makes the Florida men seem more bold and  manly, as they undoubtedly do. To-day General Saxton has returned from  Fernandina with seventy-six recruits, and the eagerness of the captains  to secure them was a sight to see. Yet they cannot deny that some of the  very best men in the regiment are South Carolinians.      December 3, 1862.--7 P.M.    What a life is this I lead! It is a dark, mild, drizzling evening, and  as the foggy air breeds sand-flies, so it calls out melodies and strange  antics from this mysterious race of grown-up children with whom my lot  is cast. All over the camp the lights glimmer in the tents, and as I sit  at my desk in the open doorway, there come mingled sounds of stir and  glee. Boys laugh and shout,--a feeble flute stirs somewhere in some  tent, not an officer's,--a drum throbs far away in another,--wild  kildeer-plover flit and wail above us, like the haunting souls of dead  slave-masters,--and from a neighboring cook-fire comes the monotonous  sound of that strange festival, half pow-wow, half prayer-meeting,  which they know only as a \"shout.\" These fires are usually enclosed in  a little booth, made neatly of palm-leaves and covered in at top, a  regular native African hut, in short, such as is pictured in books, and  such as I once got up from dried palm-leaves for a fair at home. This  hut is now crammed with men, singing at the top of their voices, in  one of their quaint, monotonous, endless, negro-Methodist chants,  with obscure syllables recurring constantly, and slight variations  interwoven, all accompanied with a regular drumming of the feet and  clapping of the hands, like castanets. Then the excitement spreads:  inside and outside the enclosure men begin to quiver and dance, others  join, a circle forms, winding monotonously round some one in the centre;  some \"heel and toe\" tumultuously, others merely tremble and stagger on,  others stoop and rise, others whirl, others caper sideways, all keep  steadily circling like dervishes; spectators applaud special strokes of  skill; my approach only enlivens the scene; the circle enlarges,  louder grows the singing, rousing shouts of encouragement come in,  half bacchanalian, half devout, \"Wake 'em, brudder!\" \"Stan' up to 'em,  brudder!\"--and still the ceaseless drumming and clapping, in perfect  cadence, goes steadily on. Suddenly there comes a sort of snap, and the  spell breaks, amid general sighing and laughter. And this not rarely and  occasionally, but night after night, while in other parts of the camp  the soberest prayers and exhortations are proceeding sedately.

And when she cried, help met her: for now  there came over the rocks a tall and stately man, and looked down  wondering upon poor Danae tossing about in the chest among the waves.    He wore a rough cloak of frieze, and on his head a broad hat to shade his  face; in his hand he carried a trident for spearing fish, and over his  shoulder was a casting-net; but Danae could see that he was no common man  by his stature, and his walk, and his flowing golden hair and beard; and  by the two servants who came behind him, carrying baskets for his fish.  But she had hardly time to look at him, before he had laid aside his  trident and leapt down the rocks, and thrown his casting-net so surely  over Danae and the chest, that he drew it, and her, and the baby, safe  upon a ledge of rock.    Then the fisherman took Danae by the hand, and lifted her out of the  chest, and said--    'O beautiful damsel, what strange chance has brought you to this island  in so flail a ship?  Who are you, and whence?  Surely you are some king's  daughter; and this boy has somewhat more than mortal.'    And as he spoke he pointed to the babe; for its face shone like the  morning star.    But Danae only held down her head, and sobbed out--    'Tell me to what land I have come, unhappy that I am; and among what men  I have fallen!'    And he said, 'This isle is called Seriphos, and I am a Hellen, and dwell  in it.  I am the brother of Polydectes the king; and men call me Dictys  the netter, because I catch the fish of the shore.'    Then Danae fell down at his feet, and embraced his knees, and cried--    'Oh, sir, have pity upon a stranger, whom a cruel doom has driven to your  land; and let me live in your house as a servant; but treat me  honourably, for I was once a king's daughter, and this my boy (as you  have truly said) is of no common race.  I will not be a charge to you, or  eat the bread of idleness; for I am more skilful in weaving and  embroidery than all the maidens of my land.'    And she was going on; but Dictys stopped her, and raised her up, and  said--    'My daughter, I am old, and my hairs are growing gray; while I have no  children to make my home cheerful.  Come with me then, and you shall be a  daughter to me and to my wife, and this babe shall be our grandchild.  For I fear the Gods, and show hospitality to all strangers; knowing that  good deeds, like evil ones, always return to those who do them.'    So Danae was comforted, and went home with Dictys the good fisherman, and  was a daughter to him and to his wife, till fifteen years were past.        PART II  HOW PERSEUS VOWED A RASH VOW      Fifteen years were past and gone, and the babe was now grown to be a tall  lad and a sailor, and went many voyages after merchandise to the islands  round.  His mother called him Perseus; but all the people in Seriphos  said that he was not the son of mortal man, and called him the son of  Zeus, the king of the Immortals.  For though he was but fifteen, he was  taller by a head than any man in the island; and he was the most skilful  of all in running and wrestling and boxing, and in throwing the quoit and  the javelin, and in rowing with the oar, and in playing on the harp, and  in all which befits a man.  And he was brave and truthful, gentle and  courteous, for good old Dictys had trained him well; and well it was for  Perseus that he had done so.  For now Danae and her son fell into great  danger, and Perseus had need of all his wit to defend his mother and  himself.    I said that Dictys' brother was Polydectes, king of the island.  He was  not a righteous man, like Dictys; but greedy, and cunning, and cruel.  And when he saw fair Danae, he wanted to marry her.  But she would not;  for she did not love him, and cared for no one but her boy, and her boy's  father, whom she never hoped to see again.  At last Polydectes became  furious; and while Perseus was away at sea he took poor Danae away from  Dictys, saying, 'If you will not be my wife, you shall be my slave.'  So  Danae was made a slave, and had to fetch water from the well, and grind  in the mill, and perhaps was beaten, and wore a heavy chain, because she  would not marry that cruel king.  But Perseus was far away over the seas  in the isle of Samos, little thinking how his mother was languishing in  grief.    Now one day at Samos, while the ship was lading, Perseus wandered into a  pleasant wood to get out of the sun, and sat down on the turf and fell  asleep.  And as he slept a strange dream came to him--the strangest dream  which he had ever had in his life.    There came a lady to him through the wood, taller than he, or any mortal  man; but beautiful exceedingly, with great gray eyes, clear and piercing,  but strangely soft and mild.  On her head was a helmet, and in her hand a  spear.  And over her shoulder, above her long blue robes, hung a  goat-skin, which bore up a mighty shield of brass, polished like a  mirror.  She stood and looked at him with her clear gray eyes; and  Perseus saw that her eye-lids never moved, nor her eyeballs, but looked  straight through and through him, and into his very heart, as if she  could see all the secrets of his soul, and knew all that he had ever  thought or longed for since the day that he was born.  And Perseus  dropped his eyes, trembling and blushing, as the wonderful lady spoke.    'Perseus, you must do an errand for me.'    'Who are you, lady?  And how do you know my name?'    'I am Pallas Athene; and I know the thoughts of all men's hearts, and  discern their manhood or their baseness.  And from the souls of clay I  turn away, and they are blest, but not by me.  They fatten at ease, like  sheep in the pasture, and eat what they did not sow, like oxen in the  stall.  They grow and spread, like the gourd along the ground; but, like  the gourd, they give no shade to the traveller, and when they are ripe  death gathers them, and they go down unloved into hell, and their name  vanishes out of the land.    'But to the souls of fire I give more fire, and to those who are manful I  give a might more than man's.  These are the heroes, the sons of the  Immortals, who are blest, but not like the souls of clay.  For I drive  them forth by strange paths, Perseus, that they may fight the Titans and  the monsters, the enemies of Gods and men.  Through doubt and need,  danger and battle, I drive them; and some of them are slain in the flower  of youth, no man knows when or where; and some of them win noble names,  and a fair and green old age; but what will be their latter end I know  not, and none, save Zeus, the father of Gods and men.  Tell me now,  Perseus, which of these two sorts of men seem to you more blest?'    Then Perseus answered boldly: 'Better to die in the flower of youth, on  the chance of winning a noble name, than to live at ease like the sheep,  and die unloved and unrenowned.'    Then that strange lady laughed, and held up her brazen shield, and cried:  'See here, Perseus; dare you face such a monster as this, and slay it,  that I may place its head upon this shield?'    And in the mirror of the shield there appeared a face, and as Perseus  looked on it his blood ran cold.  It was the face of a beautiful woman;  but her cheeks were pale as death, and her brows were knit with  everlasting pain, and her lips were thin and bitter like a snake's; and  instead of hair, vipers wreathed about her temples, and shot out their  forked tongues; while round her head were folded wings like an eagle's,  and upon her bosom claws of brass.    And Perseus looked awhile, and then said: 'If there is anything so fierce  and foul on earth, it were a noble deed to kill it.  Where can I find the  monster?'    Then the strange lady smiled again, and said: 'Not yet; you are too  young, and too unskilled; for this is Medusa the Gorgon, the mother of a  monstrous brood.  Return to your home, and do the work which waits there  for you.  You must play the man in that before I can think you worthy to  go in search of the Gorgon.'    Then Perseus would have spoken, but the strange lady vanished, and he  awoke; and behold, it was a dream.  But day and night Perseus saw before  him the face of that dreadful woman, with the vipers writhing round her  head.    So he returned home; and when he came to Seriphos, the first thing which  he heard was that his mother was a slave in the house of Polydectes.    Grinding his teeth with rage, he went out, and away to the king's palace,  and through the men's rooms, and the women's rooms, and so through all  the house (for no one dared stop him, so terrible and fair was he), till  he found his mother sitting on the floor, turning the stone hand-mill,  and weeping as she turned it.  And he lifted her up, and kissed her, and  bade her follow him forth.  But before they could pass out of the room  Polydectes came in, raging.  And when Perseus saw him, he flew upon him  as the mastiff flies on the boar.  'Villain and tyrant!' he cried; 'is  this your respect for the Gods, and thy mercy to strangers and widows?  You shall die!'  And because he had no sword he caught up the stone  hand-mill, and lifted it to dash out Polydectes' brains.    But his mother clung to him, shrieking, 'Oh, my son, we are strangers and  helpless in the land; and if you kill the king, all the people will fall  on us, and we shall both die.'    Good Dictys, too, who had come in, entreated him.  'Remember that he is  my brother.  Remember how I have brought you up, and trained you as my  own son, and spare him for my sake.'    Then Perseus lowered his hand; and Polydectes, who had been trembling all  this while like a coward, because he knew that he was in the wrong, let  Perseus and his mother pass.    Perseus took his mother to the temple of Athene, and there the priestess  made her one of the temple-sweepers; for there they knew she would be  safe, and not even Polydectes would dare to drag her away from the altar.
