But in those days there were  fewer applicants from Ohio than now, and near the close of the term  the vacancies unasked for were usually filled from applicants on  the spot.  Neither of these parties, however, graduated, so the  State of Ohio lost nothing.  We went to Baltimore by rail, there  took a boat up to Havre de Grace, then the rail to Wilmington,  Delaware, and up the Delaware in a boat to Philadelphia.  I staid  over in Philadelphia one day at the old Mansion House, to visit the  family of my brother-in-law, Mr. Reese.  I found his father a fine  sample of the old merchant gentleman, in a good house in Arch  Street, with his accomplished daughters, who had been to Ohio, and  whom I had seen there.  From Philadelphia we took boat to  Bordentown, rail to Amboy, and boat again to New York City,  stopping at the American Hotel.  I staid a week in New York City,  visiting my uncle, Charles Hoyt, at his beautiful place on Brooklyn  Heights, and my uncle James, then living in White Street.  My  friend William Scott was there, the young husband of my cousin,  Louise Hoyt; a neatly-dressed young fellow, who looked on me as an  untamed animal just caught in the far West--\"fit food for  gunpowder,\" and good for nothing else.    About June 12th I embarked in the steamer Cornelius Vanderbilt for  West Point; registered in the office of Lieutenant C. F. Smith,  Adjutant of the Military Academy, as a new cadet of the class of  1836, and at once became installed as the \"plebe\" of my  fellow-townsman, William Irvin, then entering his Third Class.    Colonel R. E. De Russy was Superintendent; Major John Fowle, Sixth  United States Infantry, Commandant.  The principal Professors were:  Mahan, Engineering; Bartlett, Natural Philosophy; Bailey,  Chemistry; Church, Mathematics; Weir, Drawing; and Berard, French.    The routine of military training and of instruction was then fully  established, and has remained almost the same ever since.  To give  a mere outline would swell this to an inconvenient size, and I  therefore merely state that I went through the regular course of  four years, graduating in June, 1840, number six in a class of  forty-three.  These forty-three were all that remained of more than  one hundred which originally constituted the class.  At the Academy  I was not considered a good soldier, for at no time was I selected  for any office, but remained a private throughout the whole four  years.  Then, as now, neatness in dress and form, with a strict  conformity to the rules, were the qualifications required for  office, and I suppose I was found not to excel in any of these.  In  studies I always held a respectable reputation with the professors,  and generally ranked among the best, especially in drawing,  chemistry, mathematics, and natural philosophy.  My average  demerits, per annum, were about one hundred and fifty, which.  reduced my final class standing from number four to six.    In June, 1840, after the final examination, the class graduated and  we received our diplomas.  Meantime, Major Delafield, United States  Engineers, had become Superintendent; Major C. F. Smith, Commandant  of Cadets; but the corps of professors and assistants remained  almost unchanged during our whole term.  We were all granted the  usual furlough of three months, and parted for our homes, there to  await assignment to our respective corps and regiments.  In due  season I was appointed and commissioned second-lieutenant, Third  Artillery, and ordered to report at Governor's Island, New York  Harbor, at the end of September.  I spent my furlough mostly at  Lancaster and Mansfield, Ohio; toward the close of September  returned to New York, reported to Major Justin Dimock, commanding  the recruiting rendezvous at Governor's Island, and was assigned to  command a company of recruits preparing for service in Florida.  Early in October this company was detailed, as one of four, to  embark in a sailing-vessel for Savannah, Georgia, under command of  Captain and Brevet Major Penrose.  We embarked and sailed, reaching  Savannah about the middle of October, where we transferred to a  small steamer and proceeded by the inland route to St. Augustine,  Florida.  We reached St. Augustine at the same time with the Eighth  Infantry, commanded by Colonel and Brevet Brigadier-General William  J. Worth.  At that time General Zachary Taylor was in chief command  in Florida, and had his headquarters at Tampa Bay.  My regiment,  the Third Artillery, occupied the posts along the Atlantic coast of  Florida, from St. Augustine south to Key Biscayne, and my own  company, A, was at Fort Pierce, Indian River.  At St. Augustine I  was detached from the company of recruits, which was designed for  the Second Infantry, and was ordered to join my proper company at  Fort Pierce.  Colonel William Gates commanded the regiment, with  Lieutenant William Austine Brown as adjutant of the regiment.  Lieutenant Bragg commanded the post of St. Augustine with his own  company, E, and G (Garner's), then commanded by Lieutenant Judd.  In, a few days I embarked in the little steamer William Gaston down  the coast, stopping one day at New Smyrna, held by John R. Vinton's  company (B), with which was serving Lieutenant William H. Shover.    In due season we arrived off the bar of Indian River and anchored.  A whale-boat came off with a crew of four men, steered by a  character of some note, known as the Pilot Ashlock.  I transferred  self and baggage to this boat, and, with the mails, was carried  through the surf over the bar, into the mouth of Indian River  Inlet.  It was then dark; we transferred to a smaller boat, and the  same crew pulled us up through a channel in the middle of Mangrove  Islands, the roosting-place of thousands of pelicans and birds that  rose in clouds and circled above our heads.  The water below was  alive with fish, whose course through it could be seen by the  phosphoric wake; and Ashlock told me many a tale of the Indian war  then in progress, and of his adventures in hunting and fishing,  which he described as the best in the world.  About two miles from  the bar, we emerged into the lagoon, a broad expanse of shallow  water that lies parallel with the coast, separated from it by a  narrow strip of sand, backed by a continuous series of islands and  promontories, covered with a dense growth of mangrove and  saw-palmetto.  Pulling across this lagoon, in about three more  miles we approached the lights of Fort Pierce.  Reaching a  small wharf, we landed, and were met by the officers of the  post, Lieutenants George Taylor and Edward J. Steptoe, and  Assistant-Surgeon James Simons.  Taking the mail-bag, we walked up  a steep sand-bluff on which the fort was situated, and across the  parade-ground to the officers' quarters.  These were six or seven  log-houses, thatched with palmetto-leaves, built on high posts,  with a porch in front, facing the water.  The men's quarters were  also of logs forming the two sides of a rectangle, open toward the  water; the intervals and flanks were closed with log stockades.  I  was assigned to one of these rooms, and at once began service with  my company, A, then commanded by Lieutenant Taylor.    The season was hardly yet come for active operations against the  Indians, so that the officers were naturally attracted to Ashlock,  who was the best fisherman I ever saw.  He soon initiated us into  the mysteries of shark-spearing, trolling for red-fish, and taking  the sheep's-head and mullet.  These abounded so that we could at  any time catch an unlimited quantity at pleasure.  The companies  also owned nets for catching green turtles.  These nets had meshes  about a foot square, were set across channels in the lagoon, the  ends secured to stakes driven into the mad, the lower line sunk  with lead or stone weights and the upper line floated with cork.  We usually visited these nets twice a day, and found from one to  six green turtles entangled in the meshes.  Disengaging them, they  were carried to pens, made with stakes stuck in the mud, where they  were fed with mangrove-leaves, and our cooks had at all times an  ample supply of the best of green turtles.  They were so cheap and  common that the soldiers regarded it as an imposition when  compelled to eat green turtle steaks, instead of poor Florida beef,  or the usual barrelled mess-pork.  I do not recall in my whole  experience a spot on earth where fish, oysters, and green turtles  so abound as at Fort Pierce, Florida.    In November, Major Childs arrived with Lieutenant Van Vliet and a  detachment of recruits to fill our two companies, and preparations  were at once begun for active operations in the field.  At that  time the Indians in the Peninsula of Florida were scattered, and  the war consisted in hunting up and securing the small fragments,  to be sent to join the others of their tribe of Seminoles already  established in the Indian Territory west of Arkansas.  Our  expeditions were mostly made in boats in the lagoons extending from  the \"Haul-over,\" near two hundred miles above the fort, down to  Jupiter Inlet, about fifty miles below, and in the many streams  which emptied therein.  Many such expeditions were made during that  winter, with more or less success, in which we succeeded in picking  up small parties of men, women, and children.  On one occasion,  near the \"Haul-over,\" when I was not present, the expedition was  more successful.  It struck a party of nearly fifty Indians, killed  several warriors, and captured others.  In this expedition my  classmate, lieutenant Van Vliet, who was an excellent shot, killed  a warrior who was running at full speed among trees, and one of the  sergeants of our company (Broderick) was said to have dispatched  three warriors, and it was reported that he took the scalp of one  and brought it in to the fort as a trophy.  Broderick was so elated  that, on reaching the post, he had to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4362"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of P. H. Sheridan, General, United States Army — Complete (#3)"],[1,"Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte, of the  Mounted Rifles, who resigned in 1854 to accept service in the French  Imperial army, but to most of those about headquarters I was an  entire stranger.  Among the latter was Captain Stewart Van Vliet, of  the Quartermaster's Department, now on the retired list.  With him I  soon came in frequent contact, and, by reason of his connection with  the Quartermaster's Department, the kindly interest he took in  forwarding my business inaugurated between us--a lasting friendship.    A day or two after my arrival at Corpus Christi a train of Government  wagons, loaded with subsistence stores and quartermaster's supplies,  started for Laredo, a small town on the Rio Grande below Fort Duncan.  There being no other means of reaching my station I put my small  personal possessions, consisting of a trunk, mattress, two blankets,  and a pillow into one of the heavily loaded wagons and proceeded to  join it, sitting on the boxes or bags of coffee and sugar, as I might  choose.  The movement of the train was very slow, as the soil was  soft on the newly made and sandy roads.  We progressed but a few  miles on our first day's journey, and in the evening parked our train  at a point where there was no wood, a scant supply of water--and that  of bad quality--but an abundance of grass.  There being no  comfortable place to sleep in any of the wagons, filled as they were  to the bows with army supplies, I spread my blankets on the ground  between the wheels of one of them, and awoke in the morning feeling  as fresh and bright as would have been possible if all the comforts  of civilization had been at my command.    It took our lumbering train many days to reach Laredo, a distance of  about one hundred and sixty miles from Corpus Christi.  Each march  was but a repetition of the first day's journey, its monotony  occasionally relieved, though, by the passage of immense flocks of  ducks and geese, and the appearance at intervals of herds of deer,  and sometimes droves of wild cattle, wild horses and mules.  The  bands of wild horses I noticed were sometimes led by mules, but  generally by stallions with long wavy manes, and flowing tails which  almost touched the ground.    We arrived at Laredo during one of those severe storms incident to  that section, which are termed \"Northers\" from the fact that the  north winds culminate occasionally in cold windstorms, frequently  preceded by heavy rains.  Generally the blow lasts for three days,  and the cold becomes intense and piercing.  While the sudden  depression of the temperature is most disagreeable, and often causes  great suffering, it is claimed that these \"Northers\" make the climate  more healthy and endurable.  They occur from October to May, and in  addition to the destruction which, through the sudden depression of  the temperature, they bring on the herds in the interior, they are  often of sufficient violence to greatly injure the harbors on the  coast.    The post near Laredo was called Fort McIntosh, and at this period the  troops stationed there consisted of eight companies of the Fifth  Infantry and two of the First, one of the First Artillery, and three  of the Mounted Rifles.  Just before the \"Norther\" began these troops  had completed a redoubt for the defense of the post, with the  exception of the ditches, but as the parapet was built of sand--the  only material about Laredo which could be obtained for its  construction--the severity of the winds was too much for such a  shifting substance, and the work was entirely blown away early in the  storm.    I was pleasantly and hospitably welcomed by the officers at the post,  all of whom were living in tents, with no furniture except a cot and  trunk, and an improvised bed for a stranger, when one happened to  come along.  After I had been kindly taken in by one of the younger  officers, I reported to the commanding officer, and was informed by  him that he would direct the quartermaster to furnish me, as soon as  convenient, with transportation to Fort Duncan, the station of my  company.    In the course of a day or two, the quartermaster notified me that a  Government six-mule wagon would be placed at my disposal to proceed  to my destination.  No better means offering, I concluded to set out  in this conveyance, and, since it was also to carry a quantity of  quartermaster's property for Fort Duncan, I managed to obtain room  enough for my bed in the limited space between the bows and load,  where I could rest tolerably well, and under cover at night, instead  of sleeping on the ground under the wagon, as I had done on the road  from Corpus Christi to Laredo.    I reached Fort Duncan in March, 1854., and was kindly received by the  commanding officer of the, regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Thompson  Morris, and by the captain of my company (\"D\"), Eugene E. McLean, and  his charming wife the only daughter of General E. V. Sumner, who was  already distinguished in our service, but much better known in after  years in the operations of the Army of the Potomac, during its early  campaigns in Virginia.  Shortly after joining company \"D\" I was sent  out on scouting duty with another company of the regiment to Camp La  Pena, about sixty or seventy miles east of Fort Duncan, in a section  of country that had for some time past been subjected to raids by the  Lipan and Comanche Indians.  Our outpost at La Pena was intended as a  protection against the predatory incursions of these savages, so  almost constant scouting became a daily occupation.  This enabled me  soon to become familiar with and make maps of the surrounding  country, and, through constant association with our Mexican guide, to  pick up in a short time quite a smattering of the Spanish language,  which was very useful to one serving on that frontier.    At that early day western Texas was literally filled with game, and  the region in the immediate vicinity of La Pena contained its full  proportion of deer, antelope, and wild turkeys.  The temptation to  hunt was therefore constantly before me, and a desire to indulge in  this pastime, whenever free from the legitimate duty of the camp,  soon took complete possession of me, so expeditions in pursuit of  game were of frequent occurrence.  In these expeditions I was always  accompanied by a soldier named Frankman, belonging to \"D\" company,  who was a fine sportsman, and a butcher by trade.  In a short period  I learned from Frankman how to approach and secure the different  species of game, and also how to dress and care for it when killed.  Almost every expedition we made was rewarded with a good supply of  deer, antelope, and wild turkeys, and we furnished the command in  camp with such abundance that it was relieved from the necessity of  drawing its beef ration, much to the discomfiture of the disgruntled  beef contractor.    The camp at La Pena was on sandy ground, unpleasant for men and  animals, and by my advice it was moved to La Pendencia, not far from  Lake Espantosa.  Before removal from our old location, however, early  one bright morning Frankman and I started on one of our customary  expeditions, going down La Pena Creek to a small creek, at the head  of which we had established a hunting rendezvous.  After proceeding  along the stream for three or four miles we saw a column of smoke on  the prairie, and supposing it arose from a camp of Mexican rancheros  catching wild horses or wild cattle, and even wild mules, which were  very numerous in that section of country along the Nueces River, we  thought we would join the party and see how much success they were  having, and observe the methods employed in this laborious and  sometimes dangerous vocation.  With this object in view, we continued  on until we found it necessary to cross to the other side of the  creek to reach the point indicated by the smoke.  Just before  reaching the crossing I discovered moccasin tracks near the water's  edge, and realizing in an instant that the camp we were approaching  might possibly be one of hostile Indians--all Indians in that country  at that time were hostile--Frankman and I backed out silently, and  made eager strides for La Pena, where we had scarcely arrived when  Captain M. E. Van Buren, of the Mounted Rifle regiment, came in with  a small command, and reported that he was out in pursuit of a band of  Comanche Indians, which had been committing depredations up about  Fort Clark, but that he had lost the trail.  I immediately informed  him of what had occurred to me during the morning, and that I could  put him on the trail of the Indians he was desirous of punishing.    We hurriedly supplied with rations his small command of thirteen,  men, and I then conducted him to the point where I had seen the  smoke, and there we found signs indicating it to be the recently  abandoned camp of the Indians he was pursuing, and we also noticed  that prairie rats had formed the principal article of diet at the  meal they had just completed.  As they had gone, I could do no more  than put him on the trail made in their departure, which was well  marked; for Indians, when in small parties, and unless pressed,  usually follow each other in single file.  Captain Van Buren followed  the trail by Fort Ewell, and well down toward Corpus Christi, day and  night, until the Indians, exhausted and used up, halted, on an open  plain, unsaddled their horses, mounted bareback, and offered battle.  Their number was double that of Van Buren's detachment, but he  attacked them fearlessly, and in the fight was mortally wounded by an  arrow which entered his body in front, just above the sword belt, and  came through the belt behind.  The principal chief of the Indians was  killed, and the rest fled.  Captain Van Buren's men carried him to  Corpus Christi, where in a few days he died.    After our removal to La Pendencia a similar pursuit of savages  occurred, but with more fortunate results."]]]
