Now, though the human mind  deceives itself by a partial acquisition of the truth, it never  retreats, and this perseverance in progress is proof of its  infallibility.  Of this we shall soon see fresh evidence.    In making himself like God, man made God like himself: this  correlation, which for many centuries had been execrated, was the  secret spring which determined the new myth.  In the days of the  patriarchs God made an alliance with man; now, to strengthen the  compact, God is to become a man.  He will take on our flesh, our  form, our passions, our joys, and our sorrows; will be born of  woman, and die as we do.  Then, after this humiliation of the  infinite, man will still pretend that he has elevated the ideal  of his God in making, by a logical conversion, him whom he  had always called creator, a saviour, a redeemer.  Humanity does  not yet say, I am God: such a usurpation would shock its piety;  it says, God is in me, IMMANUEL, nobiscum Deus.  And, at the  moment when philosophy with pride, and universal conscience with  fright, shouted with unanimous voice, The gods are departing!  excedere deos! a period of eighteen centuries of fervent  adoration and superhuman faith was inaugurated.    But the fatal end approaches.  The royalty which suffers itself  to be limited will end by the rule of demagogues; the divinity  which is defined dissolves in a pandemonium.  Christolatry is the  last term of this long evolution of human thought.  The angels,  saints, and virgins reign in heaven with God, says the catechism;  and demons and reprobates live in the hells of eternal  punishment.  Ultramundane society has its left and its right: it  is time for the equation to be completed; for this mystical  hierarchy to descend upon earth and appear in its real character.    When Milton represents the first woman admiring herself in a  fountain, and lovingly extending her arms toward her own image as  if to embrace it, he paints, feature for feature, the human  race.--This God whom you worship, O man! this God whom you have  made good, just, omnipotent, omniscient, immortal, and holy, is  yourself: this ideal of perfection is your image, purified in the  shining mirror of your conscience.  God, Nature, and man are  three aspects of one and the same being; man is God himself  arriving at self-consciousness through a thousand evolutions.  In  Jesus Christ man recognized himself as God; and Christianity is  in reality the religion of God-man.  There is no other God than  he who in the beginning said, ME; there is no other God than  THEE.    Such are the last conclusions of philosophy, which dies in  unveiling religion's mystery and its own.      II.      It seems, then, that all is ended; it seems that, with the  cessation of the worship and mystification of humanity by itself,  the theological problem is for ever put aside.  The gods have  gone: there is nothing left for man but to grow weary and die in  his egoism.  What frightful solitude extends around me, and  forces its way to the bottom of my soul!  My exaltation resembles  annihilation; and, since I made myself a God, I seem but a  shadow.  It is possible that I am still a ME, but it is very  difficult to regard myself as the absolute; and, if I am not the  absolute, I am only half of an idea.    Some ironical thinker, I know not who, has said:  \"A little  philosophy leads away from religion, and much philosophy leads  back to it.\"  This proposition is humiliatingly true.    Every science develops in three successive periods, which may be  called--comparing them with the grand periods of  civilization--the religious period, the sophistical period, the  scientific period.[3]  Thus, alchemy represents the religious  period of the science afterwards called chemistry, whose  definitive plan is not yet discovered; likewise astrology was the  religious period of another science, since  established,--astronomy.      [3] See, among others, Auguste Comte, \"Course of Positive  Philosophy,\" and P. J. Proudhon, \"Creation of Order in Humanity.\"        Now, after being laughed at for sixty years about the  philosopher's stone, chemists, governed by experience, no longer  dare to deny the transmutability of bodies; while astronomers  are led by the structure of the world to suspect also an organism  of the world; that is, something precisely like astrology.  Are  we not justified in saying, in imitation of the philosopher just  quoted, that, if a little chemistry leads away from the  philosopher's stone, much chemistry leads back to it; and  similarly, that, if a little astronomy makes us laugh at  astrologers, much astronomy will make us believe in them?[4]      [4] I do not mean to affirm here in a positive manner the  transmutability of bodies, or to point it out as a subject for  investigation; still less do I pretend to say what ought to be  the opinion of savants upon this point.  I wish only to call  attention to the species of scepticism generated in every  uninformed mind by the most general conclusions of chemical  philosophy, or, better, by the irreconcilable hypotheses which  serve as the basis of its theories.  Chemistry is truly the  despair of reason: on all sides it mingles with the fanciful; and  the more knowledge of it we gain by experience, the more it  envelops itself in impenetrable mysteries.  This thought was  recently suggested to me by reading M. Liebig's \"Letters on  Chemistry\" (Paris, Masgana, 1845, translation of Bertet-Dupiney  and Dubreuil Helion).    Thus M. Liebig, after having banished from science hypothetical  causes and all the entities admitted by the ancients,--such as  the creative power of matter, the horror of a vacuum, the esprit  recteur, etc. (p. 22),--admits immediately, as necessary to the  comprehension of chemical phenomena, a series of entities no less  obscure,--vital force, chemical force, electric force, the force  of attraction, etc. (pp. 146, 149).  One might call it a  realization of the properties of bodies, in imitation of the  psychologists' realization of the faculties of the soul under the  names liberty, imagination, memory, etc.  Why not keep to the  elements?  Why, if the atoms have weight of their own, as M.  Liebig appears to believe, may they not also have electricity and  life of their own?  Curious thing! the phenomena of matter, like  those of mind, become intelligible only by supposing them to be  produced by unintelligible forces and governed by contradictory  laws: such is the inference to be drawn from every page of M.  Liebig's book.    Matter, according to M. Liebig, is essentially inert and entirely  destitute of spontaneous activity (p. 148): why, then, do the  atoms have weight?  Is not the weight inherent in atoms the real,  eternal, and spontaneous motion of matter?  And that which we  chance to regard as rest,--may it not be equilibrium rather?  Why, then, suppose now an inertia which definitions contradict,  now an external potentiality which nothing proves?    Atoms having WEIGHT, M. Liebig infers that they are INDIVISIBLE  (p. 58).  What logic!  Weight is only force, that is, a thing  hidden from the senses, whose phenomena alone are perceptible,--a  thing, consequently, to which the idea of division and indivision  is inapplicable; and from the presence of this force, from the  hypothesis of an indeterminate and immaterial entity, is inferred  an indivisible material existence!    For the rest, M. Liebig confesses that it is IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE  MIND to conceive of particles absolutely indivisible; he  recognizes, further, that the FACT of this indivisibility is not  proved; but he adds that science cannot dispense with this  hypothesis: so that, by the confession of its teachers, chemistry  has for its point of departure a fiction as repugnant to the mind  as it is foreign to experience.  What irony!    Atoms are unequal in weight, says M. Liebig, because unequal in  volume: nevertheless, it is impossible to demonstrate that  chemical equivalents express the relative weight of atoms, or, in  other words, that what the calculation of atomic equivalents  leads us to regard as an atom is not composed of several atoms.  This is tantamount to saying that MORE MATTER weighs more than  LESS MATTER; and, since weight is the essence of materiality, we  may logically conclude that, weight being universally identical  with itself, there is also an identity in matter; that the  differences of simple bodies are due solely, either to different  methods of atomic association, or to different degrees of  molecular condensation, and that, in reality, atoms are  transmutable: which M. Liebig does not admit.    \"We have,\" he says, \"no reason for believing that one element is  convertible into another element\" (p. 135).  What do you know  about it?  The reasons for believing in such a conversion can  very well exist and at the same time escape your attention; and  it is not certain that your intelligence in this respect has  risen to the level of your experience.  But, admitting the  negative argument of M. Liebig, what follows?  That, with about  fifty-six exceptions, irreducible as yet, all matter is in a  condition of perpetual metamorphosis.  Now, it is a law of our  reason to suppose in Nature unity of substance as well as unity  of force and system; moreover, the series of chemical compounds  and simple substances themselves leads us irresistibly to this  conclusion.  Why, then, refuse to follow to the end the road  opened by science, and to admit an hypothesis which is the  inevitable result of experience itself?    M. Liebig not only denies the transmutability of elements, but  rejects the spontaneous formation of germs.  Now, if we reject  the spontaneous formation of germs, we are forced to admit their  eternity; and as, on the other hand,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44414"],[0,"The Mormon Prophet and His Harem (#3)"],[1,"mptation, and, hankering  after the flesh-pots of Egypt, lose their birthright? They wept, they  hesitated, but the strong will and iron nerve of Brigham conquered, and  they obeyed.    In February, 1846, they crossed the Mississippi on the ice, and leaving  home, property, and kindred, they took up their line of march for the  land of the setting sun. As the long trains rolled by, Brigham  comforted, counselled, and blessed the weeping emigrants. He told them  of the land where they should worship \"under their own vine and  fig-tree, with none to molest or make them afraid.\" Alas for their  fainting hearts! Little did they suspect that the cruel ambition of  their God-man would lead them to a land as barren as the Desert of  Sahara, and as devoid of vegetation as the Rock of Gibraltar.    They established themselves in winter-quarters at Kanesville, now  Council Bluffs, Iowa. Here new difficulties arose. The church was poor,  and means were needed to supply the current necessities, as well as to  defray the expense of the journey to their new Zion. Various schemes  were resorted to for the purpose of \"raising the wind.\" A band of  Danites was sent out to steal cattle and horses, and convey them beyond  the jurisdiction of the State authorities. Others were detailed to make  and circulate counterfeit money. While these little speculations were  progressing, Brigham was trying his hand at diplomacy. He is reported to  have sent James C. Little to Washington, to request the privilege of  raising a battalion of Mormons for the Mexican war.    This movement was prompted by several considerations. First, it was  thought necessary for the safety of the church that they should make a  show of patriotism; secondly, these soldiers would draw pay from the  government, which Brigham could appropriate; and thirdly, they were to  be discharged in Mexico, where, at that time, he designed to found his  theocratic monarchy. It has been asserted by some persons that Brigham  received $20,000 from the government, as a bonus, for raising the  battalion; but I find no evidence to substantiate this assertion. The  following affidavit will show in what manner he was benefited by this  transaction:--         \"TERRITORY OF UTAH,    }         GREAT SALT LAKE CITY.}         \"Alexander McCord says that he was mustered into the U. S.       service in the Mormon Battalion, August 16th, 1846. That an       advance of $42.50 was issued by the government per man,       ostensibly for the purpose of clothing the command, making a       total to the battalion of $22,500. That this amount was       received by Parley P. Pratt, and forwarded by him to Brigham       Young, who proffered to apply the same for the benefit of the       families of the battalion, who were in a state of destitution.       That he, Brigham, informed them he would send to St Louis,       purchase goods, and deal them out for the benefit of said       families at wholesale prices. Also made a covenant with them,       calling upon God and angels to witness the same. That he would       transport their families to them in Mexico, now California,       even if he had to leave his own family behind; also would       provide houses for them. That in his public address to the       battalion, in relation to this subject, he strongly urged the       advantages that would accrue to his church by their compliance       with this requisition, making it entirely a matter of       self-interest, with the sole view of accomplishing certain       private ends; and not in anywise appealing to their loyalty,       or setting forth the necessity of rendering assistance to the       parent government.         \"That he did not fulfil the promises he had made. Some few       articles were served out to their families at enormous       rates,--his (McCord's) wife having to take sole-leather, for       which she had no use. That when their wives appealed to him,       expecting in good faith to receive according to promise, he       laughed, mimicked, and made fun of them on the public stand;       showing how they cried and whined. On the arrival of the money       at Council Bluffs, some of the women, being entirely       destitute, desired their husbands' share, and some cried for       the want of it. Young ridiculed them, and told them if they       insisted upon having the money, they must not look to him for       support or protection; thus compelling them to accept of his       terms.         \"Two agents, John D. Lee and Major Egan, followed the       battalion to Santa Fe, and there received a draft on       Leavenworth, for the first month and a half's pay, with the       understanding from the soldiers it was to be paid to their       families. The authorities of the church drew the amount, and       then took out the tithing for themselves, one tenth.         \"One of the inducements held out by the government, was to       discharge them, with their arms in Mexico, which was done.       When he (McCord) arrived in Utah, October, 1847, he found his       family not here, and was prevented by the church authorities       from going after them; and was not permitted to leave until       January following. When he reached his family at Winter       Quarters, Missouri, he found no preparations made for their       being forwarded to Utah, and there were none made afterwards.

Court, Utah_.\"    By this operation, Brigham must have realized the neat little sum of  $10,000. This enabled him to fit out an expedition to explore the  country west of the Rocky Mountains. Accordingly, in the spring of 1847,  with one hundred and forty-three of his tried adherents, he made the  journey to Salt Lake, where they arrived July 24, 1847. A colony was at  once established, and a part of the number left to commence farming  operations. Brigham, with the remainder, returned to \"Winter Quarters.\"  Here he found the people on the point of starvation, while fevers and  the cholera were rapidly thinning their ranks. Brigham at once commenced  alleviating their suffering, and in the excess of their gratitude, these  poor deluded creatures did not see that he was the cause of all their  misery.    Young was now ready to enact another scene in this Mormon drama. He was  ruling the church in the capacity of President of the Twelve Apostles.  He desired greater power; he wished to occupy the place of the Prophet  of the Lord. This was the more difficult, as the people venerated the  memory of Joseph Smith, sanctified as it was by the remembrance of his  cruel and untimely death. Brigham knew well the extent of this feeling,  and that it would be impossible to supplant Joseph in their affections,  and extremely difficult to occupy his position. But his plans demanded  that he should be in form what he was in fact,--the absolute head of the  church. He resolved to execute a brilliant _coup d'etat_, and risk the  consequences.    On the morning of the 24th of December, 1847, he ascended the pulpit to  preach; and with that power of mimicry and imitation for which he is so  remarkable, aided, doubtless, by works of art to enable him to represent  the features and _personnel_ of Smith, he so completely assumed the tone  and manner, and presented the appearance of Joseph, that the  congregation believed that their dead prophet stood before them. The  effect was electrical. Women screamed and fainted; strong men wept; the  delusion was complete. \"_The mantle of Joseph had fallen upon  Brigham_;\" he was henceforth their Prophet, Seer, and Revelator, the  rightful successor to the Presidency. One old brother told me that he  really believed that Joseph was present in the flesh, so strong was the  personal resemblance at the time. As soon as the tumult subsided, the  people elected Brigham \"President of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter Day Saints in all the world.\" He appointed Heber C. Kimball and  Willard Richards as his counsellors. These three constituted the \"First  Presidency.\" This action was subsequently confirmed, at a conference  held April 6, 1848, at the same place. Brigham was now the nominal as  well as the real leader of this strange community.    A greater trial demanded his forethought. The whole church was to be  removed over a thousand miles, through an almost unknown country, full  of dangers and difficulties.    The following account of the manner in which this difficult undertaking  was executed, is from the pen of John Hyde, Jr.:--         \"Some ability is required to efficiently remove bodies of       armed troops over such new and pioneering obstacles: well       supplied, equipped, and mounted, it takes a commander's skill;       but here were poor, unprovided, feeble men, women, and       children, shaking with ague, pale with suffering, hollow and       gaunt with recent hunger. Without strife, without discord,       almost without a murmur, this heterogeneous mass moved off.       Many groaned with anguish, but none with complaint. Brigham's       energy inspired them all; his genius controlled them all.       Marking their road with their gravestones, they arrived at       Salt Lake Valley, destitute and feeble, in 1848. The desert to       which they had come was as cheerless as their past history.       From cruel foes they had fled to as unfeeling a wilderness.       Renewed difficulties demanded a renewed effort from Brigham.       Everything depended on him. Starvation and nakedness stared in    "]]]
