yea, I have a             goodly heritage.    19:016:007 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins             also instruct me in the night seasons.    19:016:008 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my             right hand, I shall not be moved.    19:016:009 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh             also shall rest in hope.    19:016:010 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou             suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.    19:016:011 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness             of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.    19:017:001 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my             prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.    19:017:002 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes             behold the things that are equal.    19:017:003 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the             night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am             purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.    19:017:004 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have             kept me from the paths of the destroyer.    19:017:005 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.    19:017:006 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline             thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.    19:017:007 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy             right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that             rise up against them.    19:017:008 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of             thy wings,    19:017:009 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who             compass me about.    19:017:010 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they             speak proudly.    19:017:011 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their             eyes bowing down to the earth;    19:017:012 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a             young lion lurking in secret places.    19:017:013 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul             from the wicked, which is thy sword:    19:017:014 From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,             which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou             fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and             leave the rest of their substance to their babes.    19:017:015 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be             satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.    19:018:001 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.    19:018:002 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my             God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the             horn of my salvation, and my high tower.    19:018:003 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so             shall I be saved from mine enemies.    19:018:004 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly             men made me afraid.    19:018:005 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death             prevented me.    19:018:006 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God:             he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before             him, even into his ears.    19:018:007 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the             hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.    19:018:008 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his             mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.    19:018:009 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was             under his feet.    19:018:010 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon             the wings of the wind.    19:018:011 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about             him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.    19:018:012 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,             hail stones and coals of fire.    19:018:013 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave             his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.    19:018:014 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot             out lightnings, and discomfited them.    19:018:015 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of             the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast             of the breath of thy nostrils.    19:018:016 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.    19:018:017 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which             hated me: for they were too strong for me.    19:018:018 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was             my stay.    19:018:019 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,             because he delighted in me.    19:018:020 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according             to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.    19:018:021 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly             departed from my God.    19:018:022 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away             his statutes from me.    19:018:023 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine             iniquity.    19:018:024 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my             righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his             eyesight.    19:018:025 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an             upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;    19:018:026 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the             froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.    19:018:027 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down             high looks.    19:018:028 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten             my darkness.    19:018:029 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I             leaped over a wall.    19:018:030 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried:             he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.    19:018:031 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?    19:018:032 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way             perfect.    19:018:033 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my             high places.    19:018:034 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken             by mine arms.    19:018:035 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy             right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me             great.    19:018:036 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not             slip.    19:018:037 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I             turn again till they were consumed.    19:018:038 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are             fallen under my feet.    19:018:039 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou             hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.    19:018:040 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I             might destroy them that hate me.    19:018:041 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the             LORD, but he answered them not.    19:018:042 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did             cast them out as the dirt in the streets.    19:018:043 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and             thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I             have not known shall serve me.    19:018:044 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers             shall submit themselves unto me.    19:018:045 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their             close places.    19:018:046 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my             salvation be exalted.    19:018:047 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.    19:018:048 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up             above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me             from the violent man.    19:018:049 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the             heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.    19:018:050 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to             his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.    19:019:001 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament             sheweth his handywork.    19:019:002 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth             knowledge.    19:019:003 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not             heard.    19:019:004 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words             to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for             the sun,    19:019:005 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and             rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.    19:019:006 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit             unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat             thereof.    19:019:007 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the             testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.    19:019:008 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the             commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8020"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 20: Proverbs (#3)"],[1,", and kissed him, and with an impudent face             said unto him,    20:007:014 I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.    20:007:015 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy             face, and I have found thee.    20:007:016 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved             works, with fine linen of Egypt.    20:007:017 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.    20:007:018 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us             solace ourselves with loves.    20:007:019 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:    20:007:020 He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at             the day appointed.    20:007:021 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the             flattering of her lips she forced him.    20:007:022 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the             slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;    20:007:023 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the             snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.    20:007:024 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to             the words of my mouth.    20:007:025 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her             paths.    20:007:026 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have             been slain by her.    20:007:027 Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of             death.    20:008:001 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?    20:008:002 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the             places of the paths.    20:008:003 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the             coming in at the doors.    20:008:004 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.    20:008:005 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an             understanding heart.    20:008:006 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of             my lips shall be right things.    20:008:007 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an             abomination to my lips.    20:008:008 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is             nothing froward or perverse in them.    20:008:009 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to             them that find knowledge.    20:008:010 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather             than choice gold.    20:008:011 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may             be desired are not to be compared to it.    20:008:012 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty             inventions.    20:008:013 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy,             and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.    20:008:014 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have             strength.    20:008:015 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.    20:008:016 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the             earth.    20:008:017 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall             find me.    20:008:018 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and             righteousness.    20:008:019 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my             revenue than choice silver.    20:008:020 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths             of judgment:    20:008:021 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and             I will fill their treasures.    20:008:022 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his             works of old.    20:008:023 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the             earth was.    20:008:024 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there             were no fountains abounding with water.    20:008:025 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I             brought forth:    20:008:026 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor             the highest part of the dust of the world.    20:008:027 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a             compass upon the face of the depth:    20:008:028 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the             fountains of the deep:    20:008:029 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not             pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the             earth:    20:008:030 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily             his delight, rejoicing always before him;    20:008:031 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights             were with the sons of men.    20:008:032 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are             they that keep my ways.    20:008:033 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.    20:008:034 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my             gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.    20:008:035 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of             the LORD.    20:008:036 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they             that hate me love death.    20:009:001 Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven             pillars:    20:009:002 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she             hath also furnished her table.    20:009:003 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest             places of the city,    20:009:004 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that             wanteth understanding, she saith to him,    20:009:005 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have             mingled.    20:009:006 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of             understanding.    20:009:007 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he             that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.    20:009:008 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man,             and he will love thee.    20:009:009 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser:             teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.    20:009:010 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the             knowledge of the holy is understanding.    20:009:011 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy             life shall be increased.    20:009:012 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou             scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.    20:009:013 A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth             nothing.    20:009:014 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the             high places of the city,    20:009:015 To call passengers who go right on their ways:    20:009:016 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that             wanteth understanding, she saith to him,    20:009:017 Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is             pleasant.    20:009:018 But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her             guests are in the depths of hell.    20:010:001 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but             a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.    20:010:002 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness             delivereth from death.    20:010:003 The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish:             but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.    20:010:004 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand             of the diligent maketh rich.    20:010:005 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that             sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.    20:010:006 Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth             the mouth of the wicked.    20:010:007 The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked             shall rot.    20:010:008 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating             fool shall fall.    20:010:009 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that             perverteth his ways shall be known.    20:010:010 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating             fool shall fall.    20:010:011 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence             covereth the mouth of the wicked.    20:010:012 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.    20:010:013 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found:             but a rod is for the back of him that is void of             understanding.    20:010:014 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is             near destruction.    20:010:015 The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of             the poor is their poverty.    20:010:016 The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the             wicked to sin.    20:010:017 He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that             refuseth reproof erreth.    20:010:018 He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a             slander, is a fool.    20:010:019 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that             refraineth his lips is wise.    20:010:020 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the             wicked is little worth.    20:010:021 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of             wisdom.    20:010:022 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no             sorrow with it.    20:010:023 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of             understanding hath wisdom.    20:010:024 "]]]
