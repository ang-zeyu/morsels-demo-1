Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their  duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the  more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns,  he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence,  that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so  many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with  virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for  the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought  that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of  clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the  painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches.  He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of  life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his  entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving  which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping  favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening  countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he  opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and  his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours,  he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles  that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of  snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that  congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those  volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some  compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his  dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed  him in his career.    He watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the  character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other  signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to  their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing  his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity  to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a  romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather  than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him  attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was  always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs  were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in  ---- Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some  information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had  only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was  time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been  thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the  career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the  aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies,  whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of  pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in  carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning  his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a  proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him,  who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly  accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.    Hitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's  character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions  were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions  from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse  in his liberality;--the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received  from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But  Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous,  reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue,  that he bestowed his alms;--these were sent from the door with  hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask  something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his  lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away  with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater  importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring  bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about  the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his  mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there  was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or  sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other  towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent  eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all  fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro  table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the  known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he  gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he  generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he  encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a  numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law--this  apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled  with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the  half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth,  torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a  dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend;  whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute  hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth,  wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet  he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the  ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the  convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a  certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of  combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to  represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and  pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own  profit;--but he delayed it--for each day he hoped his friend would  give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him;  however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst  the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his  eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of  his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the  constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to  his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something  supernatural.    They soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his  companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of  an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of  another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters  arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first  was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were  from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before  entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in  his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the  belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his  friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that  the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his  licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered,  that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of  her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification,  that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the  pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and  degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought,  apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure,  thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole  deformity of their vices to the public gaze.    Aubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown  a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent  some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in  the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight  circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and  soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the  inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly  frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met  with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in  secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon  discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most  likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing  no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked  him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same  time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night.  Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed  all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether  he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and,  immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must  decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed  tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling  upon the mother of the lady, informed her"]]]
