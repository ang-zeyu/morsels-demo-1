If I went among them as a gentleman, there  would be restraints and conventionalities which would shut me out  from their private joys and troubles, and I should get no further  than the outside shell.    One morning I was out on a long walk to get up muscle for my trip,  and had climbed the ridge which bordered the northern extremity  of the valley, when I came upon an artificial opening in the face  of a low precipice, and recognized it by its location as a hermitage  which had often been pointed out to me from a distance as the den  of a hermit of high renown for dirt and austerity.  I knew he had  lately been offered a situation in the Great Sahara, where lions  and sandflies made the hermit-life peculiarly attractive and  difficult, and had gone to Africa to take possession, so I thought  I would look in and see how the atmosphere of this den agreed  with its reputation.    My surprise was great: the place was newly swept and scoured.  Then there was another surprise.  Back in the gloom of the cavern  I heard the clink of a little bell, and then this exclamation:    \"Hello Central!  Is this you, Camelot?--Behold, thou mayst glad  thy heart an thou hast faith to believe the wonderful when that  it cometh in unexpected guise and maketh itself manifest in  impossible places--here standeth in the flesh his mightiness  The Boss, and with thine own ears shall ye hear him speak!\"    Now what a radical reversal of things this was; what a jumbling  together of extravagant incongruities; what a fantastic conjunction  of opposites and irreconcilables--the home of the bogus miracle  become the home of a real one, the den of a mediaeval hermit turned  into a telephone office!    The telephone clerk stepped into the light, and I recognized one  of my young fellows.  I said:    \"How long has this office been established here, Ulfius?\"    \"But since midnight, fair Sir Boss, an it please you.  We saw many  lights in the valley, and so judged it well to make a station,  for that where so many lights be needs must they indicate a town  of goodly size.\"    \"Quite right.  It isn't a town in the customary sense, but it's  a good stand, anyway.  Do you know where you are?\"    \"Of that I have had no time to make inquiry; for whenas my  comradeship moved hence upon their labors, leaving me in charge,  I got me to needed rest, purposing to inquire when I waked, and  report the place's name to Camelot for record.\"    \"Well, this is the Valley of Holiness.\"    It didn't take; I mean, he didn't start at the name, as I had  supposed he would.  He merely said:    \"I will so report it.\"    \"Why, the surrounding regions are filled with the noise of late  wonders that have happened here!  You didn't hear of them?\"    \"Ah, ye will remember we move by night, and avoid speech with all.  We learn naught but that we get by the telephone from Camelot.\"    \"Why _they_ know all about this thing.  Haven't they told you anything  about the great miracle of the restoration of a holy fountain?\"    \"Oh, _that_?  Indeed yes.  But the name of _this_ valley doth woundily  differ from the name of _that_ one; indeed to differ wider were not pos--\"    \"What was that name, then?\"    \"The Valley of Hellishness.\"    \"_That_ explains it.  Confound a telephone, anyway.  It is the very  demon for conveying similarities of sound that are miracles of  divergence from similarity of sense.  But no matter, you know  the name of the place now.  Call up Camelot.\"    He did it, and had Clarence sent for.  It was good to hear my boy's  voice again.  It was like being home.  After some affectionate  interchanges, and some account of my late illness, I said:    \"What is new?\"    \"The king and queen and many of the court do start even in this  hour, to go to your valley to pay pious homage to the waters ye  have restored, and cleanse themselves of sin, and see the place  where the infernal spirit spouted true hell-flames to the clouds  --an ye listen sharply ye may hear me wink and hear me likewise  smile a smile, sith 'twas I that made selection of those flames  from out our stock and sent them by your order.\"    \"Does the king know the way to this place?\"    \"The king?--no, nor to any other in his realms, mayhap; but the lads  that holp you with your miracle will be his guide and lead the way,  and appoint the places for rests at noons and sleeps at night.\"    \"This will bring them here--when?\"    \"Mid-afternoon, or later, the third day.\"    \"Anything else in the way of news?\"    \"The king hath begun the raising of the standing army ye suggested  to him; one regiment is complete and officered.\"    \"The mischief!  I wanted a main hand in that myself.  There is  only one body of men in the kingdom that are fitted to officer  a regular army.\"    \"Yes--and now ye will marvel to know there's not so much as one  West Pointer in that regiment.\"    \"What are you talking about?  Are you in earnest?\"    \"It is truly as I have said.\"    \"Why, this makes me uneasy.  Who were chosen, and what was the  method?  Competitive examination?\"    \"Indeed, I know naught of the method.  I but know this--these  officers be all of noble family, and are born--what is it you  call it?--chuckleheads.\"    \"There's something wrong, Clarence.\"    \"Comfort yourself, then; for two candidates for a lieutenancy do  travel hence with the king--young nobles both--and if you but wait  where you are you will hear them questioned.\"    \"That is news to the purpose.  I will get one West Pointer in,  anyway.  Mount a man and send him to that school with a message;  let him kill horses, if necessary, but he must be there before  sunset to-night and say--\"    \"There is no need.  I have laid a ground wire to the school.  Prithee let me connect you with it.\"    It sounded good!  In this atmosphere of telephones and lightning  communication with distant regions, I was breathing the breath  of life again after long suffocation.  I realized, then, what a  creepy, dull, inanimate horror this land had been to me all these  years, and how I had been in such a stifled condition of mind as  to have grown used to it almost beyond the power to notice it.    I gave my order to the superintendent of the Academy personally.  I also asked him to bring me some paper and a fountain pen and  a box or so of safety matches.  I was getting tired of doing  without these conveniences.  I could have them now, as I wasn't  going to wear armor any more at present, and therefore could get  at my pockets.    When I got back to the monastery, I found a thing of interest  going on.  The abbot and his monks were assembled in the great  hall, observing with childish wonder and faith the performances  of a new magician, a fresh arrival.  His dress was the extreme of  the fantastic; as showy and foolish as the sort of thing an Indian  medicine-man wears.  He was mowing, and mumbling, and gesticulating,  and drawing mystical figures in the air and on the floor,--the  regular thing, you know.  He was a celebrity from Asia--so he  said, and that was enough.  That sort of evidence was as good  as gold, and passed current everywhere.    How easy and cheap it was to be a great magician on this fellow's  terms.  His specialty was to tell you what any individual on the  face of the globe was doing at the moment; and what he had done  at any time in the past, and what he would do at any time in the  future.  He asked if any would like to know what the Emperor of  the East was doing now?  The sparkling eyes and the delighted rubbing  of hands made eloquent answer--this reverend crowd _would_ like to  know what that monarch was at, just as this moment.  The fraud  went through some more mummery, and then made grave announcement:    \"The high and mighty Emperor of the East doth at this moment put  money in the palm of a holy begging friar--one, two, three pieces,  and they be all of silver.\"    A buzz of admiring exclamations broke out, all around:    \"It is marvelous!\"  \"Wonderful!\"  \"What study, what labor, to have  acquired a so amazing power as this!\"    Would they like to know what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing?  Yes.  He told them what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing.  Then  he told them what the Sultan of Egypt was at; also what the King  of the Remote Seas was about.  And so on and so on; and with each  new marvel the astonishment at his accuracy rose higher and higher.  They thought he must surely strike an uncertain place some time;  but no, he never had to hesitate, he always knew, and always with  unerring precision.  I saw that if this thing went on I should lose  my supremacy, this fellow would capture my following, I should  be left out in the cold.  I must put a cog in his wheel, and do it  right away, too.  I said:    \"If I might ask, I should very greatly like to know what a certain  person is doing.\"    \"Speak, and freely.  I will tell you.\"    \"It will be difficult--perhaps impossible.\"    \"My art knoweth not that word.  The more difficult it is, the more  certainly will I reveal it to you.\"    You see, I was working up the interest.  It was getting pretty  high, too; you could see that by the craning necks all around,  and the half-suspended breathing.  So now I climaxed it:    \"If you make no mistake--if you tell me truly what I want to  know--I will give you two hundred silver pennies.\"    \"The fortune is mine!  I will tell you what you would know.\"    \"Then tell me what I am doing with my right hand.\"    \"Ah-h!\"  There was a general gasp of surprise.  It had not occurred  to anybody in the crowd--that simple trick of inquiring about  somebody who wasn't ten thousand miles away.  The magician was  hit hard; it was an emergency that had never happened in his  experience before, and it corked him; he didn't know how to meet  it.  He looked stunned, confused; he couldn't say a word.  \"Come,\"  I said, \"what are you waiting for?  Is it possible you can answer up,  right off, and tell what anybody on the other side of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7247"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 6. (#3)"],[1,"people do not call _each other_ varlets.\"    \"Nay, is that true?\"    \"Yes; only those above them call them so.\"    \"Then must I try again.  I will call him villein.\"    \"No-no; for he may be a freeman.\"    \"Ah--so.  Then peradventure I should call him goodman.\"    \"That would answer, your grace, but it would be still better if  you said friend, or brother.\"    \"Brother!--to dirt like that?\"    \"Ah, but _we_ are pretending to be dirt like that, too.\"    \"It is even true.  I will say it.  Brother, bring a seat, and  thereto what cheer ye have, withal.  Now 'tis right.\"    \"Not quite, not wholly right.  You have asked for one, not _us_  --for one, not both; food for one, a seat for one.\"    The king looked puzzled--he wasn't a very heavy weight, intellectually.  His head was an hour-glass; it could stow an idea, but it had to do  it a grain at a time, not the whole idea at once.    \"Would _you_ have a seat also--and sit?\"    \"If I did not sit, the man would perceive that we were only pretending  to be equals--and playing the deception pretty poorly, too.\"    \"It is well and truly said!  How wonderful is truth, come it in  whatsoever unexpected form it may!  Yes, he must bring out seats  and food for both, and in serving us present not ewer and napkin  with more show of respect to the one than to the other.\"    \"And there is even yet a detail that needs correcting.  He must  bring nothing outside; we will go in--in among the dirt, and  possibly other repulsive things,--and take the food with the  household, and after the fashion of the house, and all on equal  terms, except the man be of the serf class; and finally, there  will be no ewer and no napkin, whether he be serf or free.  Please  walk again, my liege.  There--it is better--it is the best yet;  but not perfect.  The shoulders have known no ignobler burden  than iron mail, and they will not stoop.\"    \"Give me, then, the bag.  I will learn the spirit that goeth  with burdens that have not honor.  It is the spirit that stoopeth  the shoulders, I ween, and not the weight; for armor is heavy,  yet it is a proud burden, and a man standeth straight in it....  Nay, but me no buts, offer me no objections.  I will have the thing.  Strap it upon my back.\"    He was complete now with that knapsack on, and looked as little  like a king as any man I had ever seen.  But it was an obstinate  pair of shoulders; they could not seem to learn the trick of  stooping with any sort of deceptive naturalness.  The drill went on,  I prompting and correcting:    \"Now, make believe you are in debt, and eaten up by relentless  creditors; you are out of work--which is horse-shoeing, let us  say--and can get none; and your wife is sick, your children are  crying because they are hungry--\"    And so on, and so on.  I drilled him as representing in turn all  sorts of people out of luck and suffering dire privations and  misfortunes.  But lord, it was only just words, words--they meant  nothing in the world to him, I might just as well have whistled.  Words realize nothing, vivify nothing to you, unless you have  suffered in your own person the thing which the words try to  describe.  There are wise people who talk ever so knowingly and  complacently about \"the working classes,\" and satisfy themselves  that a day's hard intellectual work is very much harder than  a day's hard manual toil, and is righteously entitled to much  bigger pay.  Why, they really think that, you know, because they  know all about the one, but haven't tried the other.  But I know  all about both; and so far as I am concerned, there isn't money  enough in the universe to hire me to swing a pickaxe thirty days,  but I will do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as  near nothing as you can cipher it down--and I will be satisfied, too.    Intellectual \"work\" is misnamed; it is a pleasure, a dissipation,  and is its own highest reward.  The poorest paid architect,  engineer, general, author, sculptor, painter, lecturer, advocate,  legislator, actor, preacher, singer is constructively in heaven  when he is at work; and as for the musician with the fiddle-bow  in his hand who sits in the midst of a great orchestra with the  ebbing and flowing tides of divine sound washing over him--why,  certainly, he is at work, if you wish to call it that, but lord,  it's a sarcasm just the same.  The law of work does seem utterly  unfair--but there it is, and nothing can change it: the higher  the pay in enjoyment the worker gets out of it, the higher shall  be his pay in cash, also.  And it's also the very law of those  transparent swindles, transmissible nobility and kingship.        CHAPTER XXIX    THE SMALLPOX HUT    When we arrived at that hut at mid-afternoon, we saw no signs  of life about it.  The field near by had been denuded of its crop  some time before, and had a skinned look, so exhaustively had  it been harvested and gleaned.  Fences, sheds, everything had a  ruined look, and were eloquent of poverty.  No animal was around  anywhere, no living thing in sight.  The stillness was awful, it  was like the stillness of death.  The cabin was a one-story one,  whose thatch was black with age, and ragged from lack of repair.    The door stood a trifle ajar.  We approached it stealthily--on tiptoe  and at half-breath--for that is the way one's feeling makes him do,  at such a time.  The king knocked.  We waited.  No answer.  Knocked  again.  No answer.  I pushed the door softly open and looked in.  I made out some dim forms, and a woman started up from the ground  and stared at me, as one does who is wakened from sleep.  Presently  she found her voice:    \"Have mercy!\" she pleaded.  \"All is taken, nothing is left.\"    \"I have not come to take anything, poor woman.\"    \"You are not a priest?\"    \"No.\"    \"Nor come not from the lord of the manor?\"    \"No, I am a stranger.\"    \"Oh, then, for the fear of God, who visits with misery and death  such as be harmless, tarry not here, but fly!  This place is under  his curse--and his Church's.\"    \"Let me come in and help you--you are sick and in trouble.\"    I was better used to the dim light now.  I could see her hollow  eyes fixed upon me.  I could see how emaciated she was.    \"I tell you the place is under the Church's ban.  Save yourself  --and go, before some straggler see thee here, and report it.\"    \"Give yourself no trouble about me; I don't care anything for the  Church's curse.  Let me help you.\"    \"Now all good spirits--if there be any such--bless thee for that  word.  Would God I had a sup of water!--but hold, hold, forget  I said it, and fly; for there is that here that even he that  feareth not the Church must fear: this disease whereof we die.  Leave us, thou brave, good stranger, and take with thee such  whole and sincere blessing as them that be accursed can give.\"    But before this I had picked up a wooden bowl and was rushing  past the king on my way to the brook.  It was ten yards away.  When I got back and entered, the king was within, and was opening  the shutter that closed the window-hole, to let in air and light.  The place was full of a foul stench.  I put the bowl to the woman's  lips, and as she gripped it with her eager talons the shutter came  open and a strong light flooded her face.  Smallpox!    I sprang to the king, and said in his ear:    \"Out of the door on the instant, sire! the woman is dying of that  disease that wasted the skirts of Camelot two years ago.\"    He did not budge.    \"Of a truth I shall remain--and likewise help.\"    I whispered again:    \"King, it must not be.  You must go.\"    \"Ye mean well, and ye speak not unwisely.  But it were shame that  a king should know fear, and shame that belted knight should  withhold his hand where be such as need succor.  Peace, I will  not go.  It is you who must go.  The Church's ban is not upon me,  but it forbiddeth you to be here, and she will deal with you with  a heavy hand an word come to her of your trespass.\"    It was a desperate place for him to be in, and might cost him his  life, but it was no use to argue with him.  If he considered his  knightly honor at stake here, that was the end of argument; he  would stay, and nothing could prevent it; I was aware of that.  And so I dropped the subject.  The woman spoke:    \"Fair sir, of your kindness will ye climb the ladder there,  and bring me news of what ye find?  Be not afraid to report,  for times can come when even a mother's heart is past breaking  --being already broke.\"    \"Abide,\" said the king, \"and give the woman to eat.  I will go.\"  And he put down the knapsack.    I turned to start, but the king had already started.  He halted,  and looked down upon a man who lay in a dim light, and had not  noticed us thus far, or spoken.    \"Is it your husband?\" the king asked.    \"Yes.\"    \"Is he asleep?\"    \"God be thanked for that one charity, yes--these three hours.  Where shall I pay to the full, my gratitude! for my heart is  bursting with it for that sleep he sleepeth now.\"    I said:    \"We will be careful.  We will not wake him.\"    \"Ah, no, that ye will not, for he is dead.\"    \"Dead?\"    \"Yes, what triumph it is to know it!  None can harm him, none  insult him more.  He is in heaven now, and happy; or if not there,  he bides in hell and is content; for in that place he will find  neither abbot nor yet bishop.  We were boy and girl together; we  were man and wife these five and twenty years, and never separated  till this day.  Think how long that is to love and suffer together.  This morning was he out of his mind, and in his fancy we were  boy and girl again and wandering in the happy fields; and so in  that innocent glad converse wandered he far and farther, still  lightly gossiping, and entered into those other fields we know  not of, and was shut away from mortal sight.  And so there was  no parting, for in his fancy I went with him; he knew not but  I went with him, my hand in his--my young soft hand, not this"]]]
