The labor troubles, their causes,  course, and cure, took lead of all other topics in the public prints,  and in serious conversation.    The nervous tension of the public mind could not have been more  strikingly illustrated than it was by the alarm resulting from the talk  of a small band of men who called themselves anarchists, and proposed  to terrify the American people into adopting their ideas by threats of  violence, as if a mighty nation which had but just put down a rebellion  of half its own numbers, in order to maintain its political system,  were likely to adopt a new social system out of fear.    As one of the wealthy, with a large stake in the existing order of  things, I naturally shared the apprehensions of my class. The  particular grievance I had against the working classes at the time of  which I write, on account of the effect of their strikes in postponing  my wedded bliss, no doubt lent a special animosity to my feeling toward  them.        Chapter 2    The thirtieth day of May, 1887, fell on a Monday. It was one of the  annual holidays of the nation in the latter third of the nineteenth  century, being set apart under the name of Decoration Day, for doing  honor to the memory of the soldiers of the North who took part in the  war for the preservation of the union of the States. The survivors of  the war, escorted by military and civic processions and bands of music,  were wont on this occasion to visit the cemeteries and lay wreaths of  flowers upon the graves of their dead comrades, the ceremony being a  very solemn and touching one. The eldest brother of Edith Bartlett had  fallen in the war, and on Decoration Day the family was in the habit of  making a visit to Mount Auburn, where he lay.    I had asked permission to make one of the party, and, on our return to  the city at nightfall, remained to dine with the family of my  betrothed. In the drawing-room, after dinner, I picked up an evening  paper and read of a fresh strike in the building trades, which would  probably still further delay the completion of my unlucky house. I  remember distinctly how exasperated I was at this, and the  objurgations, as forcible as the presence of the ladies permitted,  which I lavished upon workmen in general, and these strikers in  particular. I had abundant sympathy from those about me, and the  remarks made in the desultory conversation which followed, upon the  unprincipled conduct of the labor agitators, were calculated to make  those gentlemen's ears tingle. It was agreed that affairs were going  from bad to worse very fast, and that there was no telling what we  should come to soon. \"The worst of it,\" I remember Mrs. Bartlett's  saying, \"is that the working classes all over the world seem to be  going crazy at once. In Europe it is far worse even than here. I'm sure  I should not dare to live there at all. I asked Mr. Bartlett the other  day where we should emigrate to if all the terrible things took place  which those socialists threaten. He said he did not know any place now  where society could be called stable except Greenland, Patagonia, and  the Chinese Empire.\" \"Those Chinamen knew what they were about,\"  somebody added, \"when they refused to let in our western civilization.  They knew what it would lead to better than we did. They saw it was  nothing but dynamite in disguise.\"    After this, I remember drawing Edith apart and trying to persuade her  that it would be better to be married at once without waiting for the  completion of the house, spending the time in travel till our home was  ready for us. She was remarkably handsome that evening, the mourning  costume that she wore in recognition of the day setting off to great  advantage the purity of her complexion. I can see her even now with my  mind's eye just as she looked that night. When I took my leave she  followed me into the hall and I kissed her good-by as usual. There was  no circumstance out of the common to distinguish this parting from  previous occasions when we had bade each other good-by for a night or a  day. There was absolutely no premonition in my mind, or I am sure in  hers, that this was more than an ordinary separation.    Ah, well!    The hour at which I had left my betrothed was a rather early one for a  lover, but the fact was no reflection on my devotion. I was a confirmed  sufferer from insomnia, and although otherwise perfectly well had been  completely fagged out that day, from having slept scarcely at all the  two previous nights. Edith knew this and had insisted on sending me  home by nine o'clock, with strict orders to go to bed at once.    The house in which I lived had been occupied by three generations of  the family of which I was the only living representative in the direct  line. It was a large, ancient wooden mansion, very elegant in an  old-fashioned way within, but situated in a quarter that had long since  become undesirable for residence, from its invasion by tenement houses  and manufactories. It was not a house to which I could think of  bringing a bride, much less so dainty a one as Edith Bartlett. I had  advertised it for sale, and meanwhile merely used it for sleeping  purposes, dining at my club. One servant, a faithful colored man by the  name of Sawyer, lived with me and attended to my few wants. One feature  of the house I expected to miss greatly when I should leave it, and  this was the sleeping chamber which I had built under the foundations.  I could not have slept in the city at all, with its never ceasing  nightly noises, if I had been obliged to use an upstairs chamber. But  to this subterranean room no murmur from the upper world ever  penetrated. When I had entered it and closed the door, I was surrounded  by the silence of the tomb. In order to prevent the dampness of the  subsoil from penetrating the chamber, the walls had been laid in  hydraulic cement and were very thick, and the floor was likewise  protected. In order that the room might serve also as a vault equally  proof against violence and flames, for the storage of valuables, I had  roofed it with stone slabs hermetically sealed, and the outer door was  of iron with a thick coating of asbestos. A small pipe, communicating  with a wind-mill on the top of the house, insured the renewal of air.    It might seem that the tenant of such a chamber ought to be able to  command slumber, but it was rare that I slept well, even there, two  nights in succession. So accustomed was I to wakefulness that I minded  little the loss of one night's rest. A second night, however, spent in  my reading chair instead of my bed, tired me out, and I never allowed  myself to go longer than that without slumber, from fear of nervous  disorder. From this statement it will be inferred that I had at my  command some artificial means for inducing sleep in the last resort,  and so in fact I had. If after two sleepless nights I found myself on  the approach of the third without sensations of drowsiness, I called in  Dr. Pillsbury.    He was a doctor by courtesy only, what was called in those days an  \"irregular\" or \"quack\" doctor. He called himself a \"Professor of Animal  Magnetism.\" I had come across him in the course of some amateur  investigations into the phenomena of animal magnetism. I don't think he  knew anything about medicine, but he was certainly a remarkable  mesmerist. It was for the purpose of being put to sleep by his  manipulations that I used to send for him when I found a third night of  sleeplessness impending. Let my nervous excitement or mental  preoccupation be however great, Dr. Pillsbury never failed, after a  short time, to leave me in a deep slumber, which continued till I was  aroused by a reversal of the mesmerizing process. The process for  awaking the sleeper was much simpler than that for putting him to  sleep, and for convenience I had made Dr Pillsbury teach Sawyer how to  do it.    My faithful servant alone knew for what purpose Dr. Pillsbury visited  me, or that he did so at all. Of course, when Edith became my wife I  should have to tell her my secrets. I had not hitherto told her this,  because there was unquestionably a slight risk in the mesmeric sleep,  and I knew she would set her face against my practice. The risk, of  course, was that it might become too profound and pass into a trance  beyond the mesmerizer's power to break, ending in death. Repeated  experiments had fully convinced me that the risk was next to nothing if  reasonable precautions were exercised, and of this I hoped, though  doubtingly, to convince Edith. I went directly home after leaving her,  and at once sent Sawyer to fetch Dr. Pillsbury. Meanwhile I sought my  subterranean sleeping chamber, and exchanging my costume for a  comfortable dressing-gown, sat down to read the letters by the evening  mail which Sawyer had laid on my reading table.    One of them was from the builder of my new house, and confirmed what I  had inferred from the newspaper item. The new strikes, he said, had  postponed indefinitely the completion of the contract, as neither  masters nor workmen would concede the point at issue without a long  struggle. Caligula wished that the Roman people had but one neck that  he might cut it off, and as I read this letter I am afraid that for a  moment I was capable of wishing the same thing concerning the laboring  classes of America. The return of Sawyer with the doctor interrupted my  gloomy meditations.    It appeared that he had with difficulty been able to secure his  services, as he was preparing to leave the city that very night. The  doctor explained that since he had seen me last he had learned of a  fine professional opening in a distant city, and decided to take prompt  advantage of it. On my asking, in some panic, what I was to do for some  one to put me to sleep, he gave me the names of several mesmerizers in  Boston who, he averred, had quite as great powers as he.    Somewhat relieved on this point, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/626"],[0,"The Love of Books: The Philobiblon of Richard de Bury (#3)"],[1," that the intellect of the students  may ascend and look from pole to pole, from the east and west, from the  north and from the south.  Therein the mighty and incomprehensible God  Himself is apprehensibly contained and worshipped; therein is revealed  the nature of things celestial, terrestrial, and infernal; therein are  discerned the laws by which every state is administered, the offices of  the celestial hierarchy are distinguished, and the tyrannies of demons  described, such as neither the ideas of Plato transcend, nor the chair  of Crato contained.    In books I find the dead as if they were alive; in books I foresee  things to come; in books warlike affairs are set forth; from books come  forth the laws of peace.  All things are corrupted and decay in time;  Saturn ceases not to devour the children that he generates; all the  glory of the world would be buried in oblivion, unless God had provided  mortals with the remedy of books.    Alexander, the conqueror of the earth, Julius, the invader of Rome and  of the world, who, the first in war and arts, assumed universal empire  under his single rule, faithful Fabricius and stern Cato, would now  have been unknown to fame, if the aid of books had been wanting.  Towers have been razed to the ground; cities have been overthrown;  triumphal arches have perished from decay; nor can either pope or king  find any means of more easily conferring the privilege of perpetuity  than by books.  The book that he has made renders its author this  service in return, that so long as the book survives its author remains  immortal and cannot die, as Ptolemy declares in the Prologue to his  Almagest: He is not dead, he says, who has given life to science.    Who therefore will limit by anything of another kind the price of the  infinite treasure of books, from which the scribe who is instructed  bringeth forth things new and old?  Truth that triumphs over all  things, which overcomes the king, wine, and women, which it is reckoned  holy to honour before friendship, which is the way without turning and  the life without end, which holy Boethius considers to be threefold in  thought, speech, and writing, seems to remain more usefully and to  fructify to greater profit in books.  For the meaning of the voice  perishes with the sound; truth latent in the mind is wisdom that is hid  and treasure that is not seen; but truth which shines forth in books  desires to manifest itself to every impressionable sense.  It commends  itself to the sight when it is read, to the hearing when it is heard,  and moreover in a manner to the touch, when it suffers itself to be  transcribed, bound, corrected, and preserved.   The undisclosed truth  of the mind, although it is the possession of the noble soul, yet  because it lacks a companion, is not certainly known to be delightful,  while neither sight nor hearing takes account of it.  Further the truth  of the voice is patent only to the ear and eludes the sight, which  reveals to us more of the qualities of things, and linked with the  subtlest of motions begins and perishes as it were in a breath.  But  the written truth of books, not transient but permanent, plainly offers  itself to be observed, and by means of the pervious spherules of the  eyes, passing through the vestibule of perception and the courts of  imagination, enters the chamber of intellect, taking its place in the  couch of memory, where it engenders the eternal truth of the mind.    Finally we must consider what pleasantness of teaching there is in  books, how easy, how secret! How safely we lay bare the poverty of  human ignorance to books without feeling any shame!  They are masters  who instruct us without rod or ferule, without angry words, without  clothes or money.  If you come to them they are not asleep; if you ask  and inquire of them they do not withdraw themselves; they do not chide  if you make mistakes; they do not laugh at you if you are ignorant.  O  books, who alone are liberal and free, who give to all who ask of you  and enfranchise all who serve you faithfully!  By how many thousand  types are ye commended to learned men in the Scriptures given us by  inspiration of God!  For ye are the minds of profoundest wisdom, to  which the wise man sends his son that he may dig out treasures: Prov.  ii.  Ye are the wells of living waters, which father Abraham first  digged, Isaac digged again, and which the Philistines strive to fill  up: Gen. xxvi.  Ye are indeed the most delightful ears of corn, full of  grain, to be rubbed only by apostolic hands, that the sweetest food may  be produced for hungry souls: Matt. xii.  Ye are the golden pots in  which manna is stored, and rocks flowing with honey, nay, combs of  honey, most plenteous udders of the milk of life, garners ever full; ye  are the tree of life and the fourfold river of Paradise, by which the  human mind is nourished, and the thirsty intellect is watered and  refreshed.  Ye are the ark of Noah and the ladder of Jacob, and the  troughs by which the young of those who look therein are coloured; ye  are the stones of testimony and the pitchers holding the lamps of  Gideon, the scrip of David, from which the smoothest stones are taken  for the slaying of Goliath.  Ye are the golden vessels of the temple,  the arms of the soldiers of the Church with which to quench all the  fiery darts of the wicked, fruitful olives, vines of Engadi, fig-trees  that are never barren, burning lamps always to be held in  readiness--and all the noblest comparisons of Scripture may be applied  to books, if we choose to speak in figures.        CHAPTER II    THE DEGREE OF AFFECTION THAT IS PROPERLY DUE TO BOOKS    Since the degree of affection a thing deserves depends upon the degree  of its value, and the previous chapter shows that the value of books is  unspeakable, it is quite clear to the reader what is the probable  conclusion from this.  I say probable, for in moral science we do not  insist upon demonstration, remembering that the educated man seeks such  degree of certainty as he perceives the subject-matter will bear, as  Aristotle testifies in the first book of his Ethics.  For Tully does  not appeal to Euclid, nor does Euclid rely upon Tully.  This at all  events we endeavour to prove, whether by logic or rhetoric, that all  riches and all delights whatsoever yield place to books in the  spiritual mind, wherein the Spirit which is charity ordereth charity.  Now in the first place, because wisdom is contained in books more than  all mortals understand, and wisdom thinks lightly of riches, as the  foregoing chapter declares.  Furthermore, Aristotle, in his Problems,  determines the question, why the ancients proposed prizes to the  stronger in gymnastic and corporeal contests, but never awarded any  prize for wisdom.  This question he solves as follows:  In gymnastic  exercises the prize is better and more desirable than that for which it  is bestowed; but it is certain that nothing is better than wisdom:  wherefore no prize could be assigned for wisdom.  And therefore neither  riches nor delights are more excellent than wisdom.  Again, only the  fool will deny that friendship is to be preferred to riches, since the  wisest of men testifies this; but the chief of philosophers honours  truth before friendship, and the truthful Zorobabel prefers it to all  things.  Riches, then, are less than truth.  Now truth is chiefly  maintained and contained in holy books--nay, they are written truth  itself, since by books we do not now mean the materials of which they  are made.  Wherefore riches are less than books, especially as the most  precious of all riches are friends, as Boethius testifies in the second  book of his Consolation; to whom the truth of books according to  Aristotle is to be preferred.  Moreover, since we know that riches  first and chiefly appertain to the support of the body only, while the  virtue of books is the perfection of reason, which is properly speaking  the happiness of man, it appears that books to the man who uses his  reason are dearer than riches.  Furthermore, that by which the faith is  more easily defended, more widely spread, more clearly preached, ought  to be more desirable to the faithful.  But this is the truth written in  books, which our Saviour plainly showed, when he was about to contend  stoutly against the Tempter, girding himself with the shield of truth  and indeed of written truth, declaring \"it is written\" of what he was  about to utter with his voice.    And, again, no one doubts that happiness is to be preferred to riches.  But happiness consists in the operation of the noblest and diviner of  the faculties that we possess--when the whole mind is occupied in  contemplating the truth of wisdom, which is the most delectable of all  our virtuous activities, as the prince of philosophers declares in the  tenth book of the Ethics, on which account it is that philosophy is  held to have wondrous pleasures in respect of purity and solidity, as  he goes on to say.  But the contemplation of truth is never more  perfect than in books, where the act of imagination perpetuated by  books does not suffer the operation of the intellect upon the truths  that it has seen to suffer interruption.  Wherefore books appear to be  the most immediate instruments of speculative delight, and therefore  Aristotle, the sun of philosophic truth, in considering the principles  of choice, teaches that in itself to philosophize is more desirable  than to be rich, although in certain cases, as where for instance one  is in need of necessaries, it may be more desirable to be rich than to  philosophize.    Moreover, since books are the aptest teachers, as the previous chapter  assumes, it is fitting to bestow on them the honour and the affection  that we owe to our teachers.  In fine, since all men naturally desire  to know, and since by means of books we can attain the knowledge of the  ancients, which is to be"]]]
