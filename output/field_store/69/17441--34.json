This he presented with his blessing to be  competed for by the dozen houses that made up the school of Wrykyn, and  it was formally established as the house cricket cup. The question now  arose: what was to be done with the other cup? The School House, who  happened to be the holders at the time, suggested disinterestedly that  it should become the property of the house which had won it last. \"Not  so,\" replied the Field Sports Committee, \"but far otherwise. We will  have it melted down in a fiery furnace, and thereafter fashioned into  eleven little silver bats. And these little silver bats shall be the  guerdon of the eleven members of the winning team, to have and to hold  for the space of one year, unless, by winning the cup twice in  succession, they gain the right of keeping the bat for yet another  year. How is that, umpire?\" And the authorities replied, \"O men of  infinite resource and sagacity, verily is it a cold day when _you_  get left behind. Forge ahead.\" But, when they had forged ahead, behold!  it would not run to eleven little silver bats, but only to ten little  silver bats. Thereupon the headmaster, a man liberal with his cash,  caused an eleventh little bat to be fashioned--for the captain of the  winning team to have and to hold in the manner aforesaid. And, to  single it out from the others, it was wrought, not of silver, but of  gold. And so it came to pass that at the time of our story Trevor was  in possession of the little gold bat, because Donaldson's had won the  cup in the previous summer, and he had captained them--and,  incidentally, had scored seventy-five without a mistake.    \"Well, I'm hanged if I would trust O'Hara with my bat,\" said Clowes,  referring to the silver ornament on his own watch-chain; \"he's probably  pawned yours in the holidays. Why did you lend it to him?\"    \"His people wanted to see it. I know him at home, you know. They asked  me to lunch the last day but one of the holidays, and we got talking  about the bat, because, of course, if we hadn't beaten Dexter's in the  final, O'Hara would have had it himself. So I sent it over next day  with a note asking O'Hara to bring it back with him here.\"    \"Oh, well, there's a chance, then, seeing he's only had it so little  time, that he hasn't pawned it yet. You'd better rush off and get it  back as soon as possible. It's no good waiting for me. I shan't be  ready for weeks.\"    \"Where's Paget?\"    \"Teaing with Donaldson. At least, he said he was going to.\"    \"Then I suppose I shall have to go alone. I hate walking alone.\"    \"If you hurry,\" said Clowes, scanning the road from his post of  vantage, \"you'll be able to go with your fascinating pal Ruthven. He's  just gone out.\"    Trevor dashed downstairs in his energetic way, and overtook the youth  referred to.    Clowes brooded over them from above like a sorrowful and rather  disgusted Providence. Trevor's liking for Ruthven, who was a  Donaldsonite like himself, was one of the few points on which the two  had any real disagreement. Clowes could not understand how any person  in his senses could of his own free will make an intimate friend of  Ruthven.    \"Hullo, Trevor,\" said Ruthven.    \"Come over to the baths,\" said Trevor, \"I want to see O'Hara about  something. Or were you going somewhere else.\"    \"I wasn't going anywhere in particular. I never know what to do in  term-time. It's deadly dull.\"    Trevor could never understand how any one could find term-time dull.  For his own part, there always seemed too much to do in the time.    \"You aren't allowed to play games?\" he said, remembering something  about a doctor's certificate in the past.    \"No,\" said Ruthven. \"Thank goodness,\" he added.    Which remark silenced Trevor. To a person who thanked goodness that he  was not allowed to play games he could find nothing to say. But he  ceased to wonder how it was that Ruthven was dull.    They proceeded to the baths together in silence. O'Hara, they were  informed by a Dexter's fag who met them outside the door, was not  about.    \"When he comes back,\" said Trevor, \"tell him I want him to come to tea  tomorrow directly after school, and bring my bat. Don't forget.\"    The fag promised to make a point of it.          III    THE MAYOR'S STATUE      One of the rules that governed the life of Donough O'Hara, the  light-hearted descendant of the O'Haras of Castle Taterfields, Co.  Clare, Ireland, was \"Never refuse the offer of a free tea\". So, on  receipt--per the Dexter's fag referred to--of Trevor's invitation, he  scratched one engagement (with his mathematical master--not wholly  unconnected with the working-out of Examples 200 to 206 in Hall and  Knight's Algebra), postponed another (with his friend and ally Moriarty,  of Dexter's, who wished to box with him in the gymnasium), and made his  way at a leisurely pace towards Donaldson's. He was feeling particularly  pleased with himself today, for several reasons. He had begun the day  well by scoring brilliantly off Mr Dexter across the matutinal rasher  and coffee. In morning school he had been put on to translate the one  passage which he happened to have prepared--the first ten lines, in  fact, of the hundred which formed the morning's lesson. And in the  final hour of afternoon school, which was devoted to French, he had  discovered and exploited with great success an entirely new and original  form of ragging. This, he felt, was the strenuous life; this was living  one's life as one's life should be lived.    He met Trevor at the gate. As they were going in, a carriage and pair  dashed past. Its cargo consisted of two people, the headmaster, looking  bored, and a small, dapper man, with a very red face, who looked  excited, and was talking volubly. Trevor and O'Hara raised their caps  as the chariot swept by, but the salute passed unnoticed. The Head  appeared to be wrapped in thought.    \"What's the Old Man doing in a carriage, I wonder,\" said Trevor,  looking after them. \"Who's that with him?\"    \"That,\" said O'Hara, \"is Sir Eustace Briggs.\"    \"Who's Sir Eustace Briggs?\"    O'Hara explained, in a rich brogue, that Sir Eustace was Mayor of  Wrykyn, a keen politician, and a hater of the Irish nation, judging by  his letters and speeches.    They went into Trevor's study. Clowes was occupying the window in his  usual manner.    \"Hullo, O'Hara,\" he said, \"there is an air of quiet satisfaction about  you that seems to show that you've been ragging Dexter. Have you?\"    \"Oh, that was only this morning at breakfast. The best rag was in  French,\" replied O'Hara, who then proceeded to explain in detail the  methods he had employed to embitter the existence of the hapless Gallic  exile with whom he had come in contact. It was that gentleman's custom  to sit on a certain desk while conducting the lesson. This desk chanced  to be O'Hara's. On the principle that a man may do what he likes with  his own, he had entered the room privily in the dinner-hour, and  removed the screws from his desk, with the result that for the first  half-hour of the lesson the class had been occupied in excavating M.  Gandinois from the ruins. That gentleman's first act on regaining his  equilibrium had been to send O'Hara out of the room, and O'Hara, who  had foreseen this emergency, had spent a very pleasant half-hour in the  passage with some mixed chocolates and a copy of Mr Hornung's  _Amateur Cracksman_. It was his notion of a cheerful and instructive  French lesson.    \"What were you talking about when you came in?\" asked Clowes. \"Who's  been slanging Ireland, O'Hara?\"    \"The man Briggs.\"    \"What are you going to do about it? Aren't you going to take any  steps?\"    \"Is it steps?\" said O'Hara, warmly, \"and haven't we----\"    He stopped.    \"Well?\"    \"Ye know,\" he said, seriously, \"ye mustn't let it go any further. I  shall get sacked if it's found out. An' so will Moriarty, too.\"    \"Why?\" asked Trevor, looking up from the tea-pot he was filling, \"what  on earth have you been doing?\"    \"Wouldn't it be rather a cheery idea,\" suggested Clowes, \"if you began  at the beginning.\"    \"Well, ye see,\" O'Hara began, \"it was this way. The first I heard of it  was from Dexter. He was trying to score off me as usual, an' he said,  'Have ye seen the paper this morning, O'Hara?' I said, no, I had not.  Then he said, 'Ah,' he said, 'ye should look at it. There's something  there that ye'll find interesting.' I said, 'Yes, sir?' in me  respectful way. 'Yes,' said he, 'the Irish members have been making  their customary disturbances in the House. Why is it, O'Hara,' he said,  'that Irishmen are always thrusting themselves forward and making  disturbances for purposes of self-advertisement?' 'Why, indeed, sir?'  said I, not knowing what else to say, and after that the conversation  ceased.\"    \"Go on,\" said Clowes.    \"After breakfast Moriarty came to me with a paper, and showed me what  they had been saying about the Irish. There was a letter from the man  Briggs on the subject. 'A very sensible and temperate letter from Sir  Eustace Briggs', they called it, but bedad! if that was a temperate  letter, I should like to know what an intemperate one is. Well, we read  it through, and Moriarty said to me, 'Can we let this stay as it is?'  And I said, 'No. We can't.' 'Well,' said Moriarty to me, 'what are we  to do about it? I should like to tar and feather the man,' he said. 'We  can't do that,' I said, 'but why not tar and feather his statue?' I  said. So we thought we would. Ye know where the statue is, I suppose?  It's in the recreation ground just across the river.\"    \"I know the place,\" said Clowes. \"Go on. This is ripping. I always knew  you were pretty mad, but this sounds as if it were going to beat all  previous records.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6886"],[0,"First Footsteps in East Africa (#3)"],[1,"only by the vague reports of native  travellers. All the Abyssinian discoverers had traversed the Dankali and  other northern tribes: the land of the Somal was still a _terra  incognita_. Harar, moreover, had never been visited, and few are the  cities of the world which in the present age, when men hurry about the  earth, have not opened their gates to European adventure. The ancient  metropolis of a once mighty race, the only permanent settlement in Eastern  Africa, the reported seat of Moslem learning, a walled city of stone  houses, possessing its independent chief, its peculiar population, its  unknown language, and its own coinage, the emporium of the coffee trade,  the head-quarters of slavery, the birth-place of the Kat plant, [9] and  the great manufactory of cotton-cloths, amply, it appeared, deserved the  trouble of exploration. That the writer was successful in his attempt, the  following pages will prove. Unfortunately it was found impossible to use  any instruments except a pocket compass, a watch, and a portable  thermometer more remarkable for convenience than correctness. But the way  was thus paved for scientific observation: shortly after the author's  departure from Harar, the Amir or chief wrote to the Acting Political  Resident at Aden, earnestly begging to be supplied with a \"Frank  physician,\" and offering protection to any European who might be persuaded  to visit his dominions.    The Appendix contains the following papers connected with the movements of  the expedition in the winter of 1854.    1. The diary and observations made by Lieut. Speke, when attempting to  reach the Wady Nogal.    2. A sketch of the grammar, and a vocabulary of the Harari tongue. This  dialect is little known to European linguists: the only notices of it  hitherto published are in Salt's Abyssinia, Appendix I. p. 6-10.; by Balbi  Atlas Ethnogr. Tab. xxxix. No. 297.; Kielmaier, Ausland, 1840, No. 76.;  and Dr. Beke (Philological Journal, April 25. 1845.)    3. Meteorological observations in the cold season of 1854-55 by Lieuts.  Herne, Stroyan, and the Author.    4. A brief description of certain peculiar customs, noticed in Nubia, by  Brown and Werne under the name of fibulation.    5. The conclusion is a condensed account of an attempt to reach Harar from  Ankobar. [10] On the 14th October 1841, Major Sir William Cornwallis  Harris (then Captain in the Bombay Engineers), Chief of the Mission sent  from India to the King of Shoa, advised Lieut. W. Barker, I. N., whose  services were imperatively required by Sir Robert Oliver, to return from  Abyssinia _via_ Harar, \"over a road hitherto untrodden by Europeans.\" As  His Majesty Sahalah Selassie had offered friendly letters to the Moslem  Amir, Capt. Harris had \"no doubt of the success of the enterprise.\"  Although the adventurous explorer was prevented by the idle fears of the  Bedouin Somal and the rapacity of his guides from visiting the city, his  pages, as a narrative of travel, will amply reward perusal. They have been  introduced into this volume mainly with the view of putting the reader in  possession of all that has hitherto been written and not published, upon  the subject of Harar. [11] For the same reason the author has not  hesitated to enrich his pages with observations drawn from Lieutenants  Cruttenden and Rigby. The former printed in the Transactions of the Bombay  Geographical Society two excellent papers: one headed a \"Report on the  Mijjertheyn Tribe of Somallies inhabiting the district forming the North  East Point of Africa;\" secondly, a \"Memoir on the Western or Edoor Tribes,  inhabiting the Somali coast of North East Africa; with the Southern  Branches of the family of Darood, resident on the banks of the Webbe  Shebayli, commonly called the River Webbe.\" Lieut. C. P. Rigby, 16th  Regiment Bombay N. I., published, also in the Transactions of the  Geographical Society of Bombay, an \"Outline of the Somali Language, with  Vocabulary,\" which supplied a great lacuna in the dialects of Eastern  Africa.    A perusal of the following pages will convince the reader that the  extensive country of the Somal is by no means destitute of capabilities.  Though partially desert, and thinly populated, it possesses valuable  articles of traffic, and its harbours export the produce of the Gurague,  Abyssinian, Galla, and other inland races. The natives of the country are  essentially commercial: they have lapsed into barbarism by reason of their  political condition--the rude equality of the Hottentots,--but they appear  to contain material for a moral regeneration. As subjects they offer a  favourable contrast to their kindred, the Arabs of El Yemen, a race  untameable as the wolf, and which, subjugated in turn by Abyssinian,  Persian, Egyptian, and Turk, has ever preserved an indomitable spirit of  freedom, and eventually succeeded in skaking off the yoke of foreign  dominion. For half a generation we have been masters of Aden, filling  Southern Arabia with our calicos and rupees--what is the present state of  affairs there? We are dared by the Bedouins to come forth from behind our  stone walls and fight like men in the plain,--British _proteges_ are  slaughtered within the range of our guns,--our allies' villages have been  burned in sight of Aden,--our deserters are welcomed and our fugitive  felons protected,--our supplies are cut off, and the garrison is reduced  to extreme distress, at the word of a half-naked bandit,--the miscreant  Bhagi who murdered Capt. Mylne in cold blood still roams the hills  unpunished,--gross insults are the sole acknowledgments of our peaceful  overtures,--the British flag has been fired upon without return, our  cruizers being ordered to act only on the defensive,--and our forbearance  to attack is universally asserted and believed to arise from mere  cowardice. Such is, and such will be, the character of the Arab!    The Sublime Porte still preserves her possessions in the Tahamah, and the  regions conterminous to Yemen, by the stringent measures with which  Mohammed Ali of Egypt opened the robber-haunted Suez road. Whenever a Turk  or a traveller is murdered, a few squadrons of Irregular Cavalry are  ordered out; they are not too nice upon the subject of retaliation, and  rarely refuse to burn a village or two, or to lay waste the crops near the  scene of outrage.    A civilized people, like ourselves, objects to such measures for many  reasons, of which none is more feeble than the fear of perpetuating a  blood feud with the Arabs. Our present relations with them are a \"very  pretty quarrel,\" and moreover one which time must strengthen, cannot  efface. By a just, wholesome, and unsparing severity we may inspire the  Bedouin with fear instead of contempt: the veriest visionary would deride  the attempt to animate him with a higher sentiment.    \"Peace,\" observes a modern sage, \"is the dream of the wise, war is the  history of man.\" To indulge in such dreams is but questionable wisdom. It  was not a \"peace-policy\" which gave the Portuguese a seaboard extending  from Cape Non to Macao. By no peace policy the Osmanlis of a past age  pushed their victorious arms from the deserts of Tartary to Aden, to  Delhi, to Algiers, and to the gates of Vienna. It was no peace policy  which made the Russians seat themselves upon the shores of the Black, the  Baltic, and the Caspian seas: gaining in the space of 150 years, and,  despite war, retaining, a territory greater than England and France  united. No peace policy enabled the French to absorb region after region  in Northern Africa, till the Mediterranean appears doomed to sink into a  Gallic lake. The English of a former generation were celebrated for  gaining ground in both hemispheres: their broad lands were not won by a  peace policy, which, however, in this our day, has on two distinct  occasions well nigh lost for them the \"gem of the British Empire\"--India.  The philanthropist and the political economist may fondly hope, by outcry  against \"territorial aggrandizement,\" by advocating a compact frontier, by  abandoning colonies, and by cultivating \"equilibrium,\" to retain our rank  amongst the great nations of the world. Never! The facts of history prove  nothing more conclusively than this: a race either progresses or  retrogrades, either increases or diminishes: the children of Time, like  their sire, cannot stand still.    The occupation of the port of Berberah has been advised for many reasons.    In the first place, Berberah is the true key of the Red Sea, the centre of  East African traffic, and the only safe place for shipping upon the  western Erythroean shore, from Suez to Guardafui. Backed by lands capable  of cultivation, and by hills covered with pine and other valuable trees,  enjoying a comparatively temperate climate, with a regular although thin  monsoon, this harbour has been coveted by many a foreign conqueror.  Circumstances have thrown it as it were into our arms, and, if we refuse  the chance, another and a rival nation will not be so blind.    Secondly, we are bound to protect the lives of British subjects upon this  coast. In A.D. 1825 the crew of the \"Mary Ann\" brig was treacherously  murdered by the Somal. The consequence of a summary and exemplary  punishment [12] was that in August 1843, when the H.E.I.C.'s war-steamer  \"Memnon\" was stranded at Ras Assayr near Cape Guardafui, no outrage was  attempted by the barbarians, upon whose barren shores our seamen remained  for months labouring at the wreck. In A.D. 1855 the Somal, having  forgotten the old lesson, renewed their practices of pillaging and  murdering strangers. It is then evident that this people cannot be trusted  without supervision, and equally certain that vessels are ever liable to  be cast ashore in this part of the Red Sea. But a year ago the French  steam corvette, \"Le Caiman,\" was lost within sight of Zayla; the Bedouin  Somal, principally Eesa, assembled a fanatic host, which"]]]
