[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5992"],[0,"Station Amusements in New Zealand (#3)"],[1,"of New Zealand colonists  than the two men, Trew and Domville, who stood before us in their  working dress of red flannel shirts and moleskin trousers, \"Cookham\"  boots and digger's plush hats. Three years before this day they had  landed at Port Lyttleton, with no other capital than their strong,  willing arms, and their sober, sensible heads. Very different is their  appearance to-day from what it was on their arrival; and the change in  their position and circumstances is as great. Their bodily frames have  filled out and developed under the influence of the healthy climate  and abundance of mutton, until they look ten years younger and twice as  strong, and each man owns a cottage and twenty acres of freehold land,  at which he works in spare time, as well as having more pounds than he  ever possessed pence in the old country, put safely away in the bank.  There can be no doubt about the future of any working man or woman  in our New Zealand colonies. It rests in their own hands, under God's  blessing, and the history of the whole human race shows us that He  always has blessed honest labour and rightly directed efforts to do our  duty in this world. Sobriety and industry are the first essentials to  success. Possessing these moral qualifications, and a pair of hands,  a man may rear up his children in those beautiful distant lands in  ignorance of what hunger; or thirst, or grinding poverty means. Hitherto  the want of places of worship, and schools for the children, have been  a sad drawback to the material advantages of colonization at the  Antipodes; but these blessings are increasing every day, and the need of  them creates the supply.    The great mistake made in England, next to that of sending out worthless  idle paupers, who have never done a hand's turn for themselves here, and  are still less likely to do it elsewhere, is for parents and guardians  to ship off to New Zealand young men who have received the up-bringing  and education of gentlemen, without a shilling in their pockets, under  the vague idea that something will turn up for them in a new place.  There is nothing which can turn up, for the machinery of civilization is  reduced to the most primitive scale in these countries; and I have known  500 pounds per annum regarded as a monstrous salary to be drawn by a  hard-worked official of some twenty years standing and great experience  in the colony. From this we may judge of the chances of remunerative  employment for a raw unfledged youth, with a smattering of classical  learning. At first they simply \"loaf\" (as it is called there) on their  acquaintances and friends. At the end of six months their clothes are  beginning to look shabby; they feel they _ought_ to do something, and  they make day by day the terrible discovery that there is nothing for  them to do in their own rank of life. Many a poor clergyman's son,  sooner than return to the home which has been so pinched to furnish  forth his passage money and outfit, takes a shepherd's billet, though he  generally makes a very bad shepherd for the first year or two; or drives  bullocks, or perhaps wanders vaguely over the country, looking for work,  and getting food and lodging indeed, for inhospitality is unknown, but  no pay. Sometimes they go to the diggings, only to find that money is as  necessary there as anywhere, and that they are not fitted to dig in wet  holes for eight or ten hours a day. Often these poor young men go home  again, and it is the best thing they can do, for at least they have  gained some knowledge of life, on its dark as well as its brighter side.  But still oftener, alas, they go hopelessly to the bad, degenerating  into billiard markers, piano players at dancing saloons, cattle drivers,  and their friends probably lose sight of them.    Once I was riding with my husband up a lovely gulley, when we heard  the crack of a stockwhip, sounding strangely through the deep eternal  silence of a New Zealand valley, and a turn of the track showed us a  heavy, timber-laden bullock-waggon labouring slowly along. At the head  of the long team sauntered the driver, in the usual rough-and-ready  costume, with his soft plush hat pulled low over his face, and pulling  vigorously at a clay pipe. In spite of all the outer surroundings,  something in the man's walk and dejected attitude struck my imagination,  and I made some remark to my companion. The sound of my voice reached  the bullock-driver's ears; he looked up, and on seeing a lady, took his  pipe out of his mouth, his hat off his head, and forcing his beasts a  little aside, stood at their head to let us pass. I smiled and nodded,  receiving in return a perfect and profound bow, and the most melancholy  glance I have ever seen in human eyes. \"Good gracious, F----,\" I cried,  when we had passed, \"who is that man?\" \"That is Sir So-and-So's third  son,\" he replied: \"they sent him out here without a shilling, five years  ago, and that is what he has come to: a working man, living with working  men. He looks heart-broken, poor fellow, doesn't he?\" I, acting upon  impulse, as any woman would have done, turning back and rode up to him,  finding it very difficult to frame my pity and sympathy in coherent  words. \"No thank you, ma'am,\" was all the answer I could get, in the  most refined, gentlemanly tone of voice: \"I'm very well as I am. I  should only have the struggle all over again if I made any change now.  It is the truest kindness to leave me alone.\" He would not even shake  hands with me; so I rode back; discomfited, to hear from F---- that he  had made many attempts to befriend him, but without success. \"In fact,\"  concluded F----, with some embarrassment, \"he drinks dreadfully, poor  fellow. Of course that is the secret of all his wretchedness, but I  believe despair drove him to it in the first instance.\"    I have also known an ex-dragoon officer working as a clerk in an  attorney's office at fifteen shillings a week, who lived like a  mechanic, and yet spake and stepped like his old self; one listened  involuntarily for the clink of the sabre and spur whenever he moved  across the room.    This has been a terrible digression, almost a social essay in fact; but  I have it so much at heart to dissuade fathers and mothers from sending  their sons so far away without any certainty of employment. Capitalists,  even small ones, do well in New Zealand: the labouring classes still  better; but there is no place yet for the educated gentleman without  money, and with hands unused to and unfit for manual labour and the  downward path is just as smooth and pleasant at first there, as anywhere  else.    Trew and Domville soon got over their momentary shyness, and answered my  inquiries about their families. Then I had a short talk with them, but  on the principle that it is \"ill speaking to a fasting man,\" we agreed  to adjourn to the clearing, where they had built a rough log hut for  temporary shelter, and have our dinner. They had provided themselves  with some bacon; but were very glad to accept of F----'s offer of  mutton, to be had for the trouble of fetching it. When we reached  the little shanty, Trew produced some capital bread, he had baked the  evening before in a camp-oven; F----'s pockets were emptied of their  load of potatoes, which were put to roast in the wood embers; rashers of  bacon and mutton chops spluttered and fizzed side-by-side on a monster  gridiron with tall feet, so as to allow it to stand by itself over the  clear fire, and we turned our chops from time to time by means of a fork  extemporized out of a pronged stick.    Over another fire, a little way to leeward, hung the bushmen's kettle on  an iron tripod, and, so soon as it boiled, my little teapot was filled  before Domville threw in his great fist-full of tea. I had brought a  tiny phial of cream in the pocket of my saddle, but the men thought it  spoiled the flavour of the tea, which they always drink \"_neat_,\"  as they call it. The Temperance Society could draw many interesting  statistics from the amount of hard work which is done in New Zealand on  tea. Now, I am sorry to say, beer is creeping up to the stations, and is  served out at shearing time and so on; but in the old days all the hard  work used to be done on tea, and tea alone, the men always declaring  they worked far better on it than on beer. \"When we have as much good  bread and mutton as we can eat,\" they would say, \"we don't feel to miss  the beer we used to drink in England;\" and at the end of a year or  two of tea and water-drinking, their bright eyes and splendid physical  condition showed plainly enough which was the best kind of beverage to  work, and work hard too, upon.    So there we sat round the fire: F---- with the men, and I, a little way  off, out of the smoke, with the dogs. Overhead, the sunlight streamed  down on the grass which had sprung up, as it always does in a clearing;  the rustle among the lofty tree tops made a delicious murmur high up in  the air; a waft of cool breeze flitted past us laden with the scent  of newly-cut wood (and who does not know that nice, _clean_ perfume?);  innumerable paroquets almost brushed us with their emerald-green wings,  whilst the tamer robin or the dingy but melodious bell-bird came near  to watch the intruders. The sweet clear whistle of the tui or  parson-bird--so called from his glossy black suit and white wattles  curling exactly where a clergy-man's bands would be,--could be heard at  a distance; whilst overhead the soft cooing of the wild pigeons, and  the hoarse croak of the ka-ka or native parrot, made up the music of  the birds' orchestra. Ah, how delicious it all was,--the Robinson Crusoe  feel of the whole thing; the heavenly air, the fluttering leaves, the  birds' chirrups and whistle, and the foreground of happy, healthy men!    Rose and I had enough to do, even with Nettle's assistance, in acting as  police to keep off those bold thieves, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5994"],[0,"Our Nervous Friends — Illustrating the Mastery of Nervousness (#3)"],[1,".  But it was a great wedding, and the eating and dancing and merry-  making continued late into the night with ample hospitality through  the morrow for the many who had come far. \"Perfectly suited,\" the  women said of the young couple.    Sam Clayton had nothing which could be discounted at the bank, but the  bride was given fifty fertile acres, and they both had industry and  thrift, ambition and pluck. The fifty acres blossomed--Sam was a good  farmer, but he proved himself a better trader, and before many years  was running a small store in town. They soon added other fifty acres--  one-hundred-and-fifty in fifteen years, and out of debt--then a  partner with money, and a thriving business. At forty-five it was: Mr.  Samuel Clayton, President of the Farmers' and Merchants' Bank, rated  at $150,000. Mrs. Clayton's ability had early been manifest. Before  her marriage she had taken prizes at the County Fair in crocheting and  plum-jell. In after years no one pretended to compete with her annual  exhibit of canned fruits, and the coveted prize to the County's best  butter-maker was awarded her many successive autumns.    Our real interest in the Claytons must begin twenty-five years after  the happy wedding. Their town, the county seat, had pushed its limits  to the skirts of the broad Clayton acres; theirs was now the leading  family in that section. Mr. Clayton, quiet, active, practical, was  capable of adjusting himself without disturbance to whatever  conditions he met. Three children had been born during the early  years--a girl and two younger boys. The daughter was of the father's  type--reserved, studious and truly worthy, for during the years that  were to come, with the man she loved waiting, she remained at home a  pillar of strength to which her mother clung. She turned from wifehood  in response to the selfish needs of this mother. She and the older  brother finished classical courses in the near-by \"University,\" for  their mother, particularly, believed in education. The brother and  sister had much in common, were indeed much alike; he, however, soon  married and moved into the new West and deservingly prospered. Fred,  the youngest, was different. During his second summer he was very ill  with cholera infantum--the days came and went--doctors came and went--  and the wonder was how life clung to the emaciated form. The mother's  love flamed forth with intensity and the nights without sleep  multiplied until she, too, looked wan and ill. She did not know how to  pray. Her parents had been Universalists--she termed herself a  Moralist; for her, heaven held no God that can hear, no Great Heart  that cares, no Understanding that notes a mother's agony. The doctors  offered no hope. The child was starving; no food nor medicine had  agreed, and the end was near. A neighboring grandmother told how her  child had been sick the same way, and how she had given him baked  sweet potato which was the first thing he had digested for days. As  fate would have it, it was even so with Fred, and he recovered leaving  his mother devoid of faith in any one calling himself doctor, and  fanatically devoted to the child she had so nearly lost. From that  sickness she hovered over him, protecting him from the training she  gave her other children--the kind she herself had received. His wish  became her law; he was humored into weakness. He never became robust  physically, and early showed defects quite unknown in either branch of  the family. He failed in college, for which failure his mother found  adequate excuse. He entered the bank, but within a few months his  peculations would have been discovered had he not confessed to his  mother, who made the discrepancy good from her private funds. During  the next few years she found it necessary on repeated occasions to  draw cheeks on her personal account to save him from trouble--but  never a word of censure for him, always excuses. He was drinking,  those days, and gambling. In the near-by state capitol the cards went  his way one night. Hilarious with success and drink, he started for  his room. There was a mix-up with his companions. He was left in the  snow, unconscious--his winnings gone. The wealth of his father and the  devotion of his mother could not save him, and he went with pneumonia  a few days later. It was said that this caused her breakdown--let us  see.    As a girl, Elizabeth had lived in a home of plenty, in a home of local  aristocracy. She was perfectly trained in all household activities  and, for that period, had an excellent education, having spent one  year in a far-away \"Female Seminary.\" Her mind was good, her pride in  appearance almost excessive. She said she \"loved Sam Clayton,\" and  probably did, though with none of the devotion she gave her son, nor  with sufficient trust to share her patrimony which amounted to a small  fortune with him when it came. In fact, she ran her own business, nor  relied upon the safety of the \"Farmers' and Merchants' Bank\" in making  her deposits. She was a housewife of repute, devoted to every detail  of housewifery and economics. There was always plenty to eat and of  the best; perfect order and cleanliness of the immaculate type were  her pride. Excellent advice she frequently gave her husband about  finances and management, but otherwise she added no interest to his  life, and there was peace between husband and wife--because Sam was a  peaceable man. As a mother, she taught the two older children domestic  usefulness, with every care; they were always clad in good, clean  clothes, clad better than the neighbors' children, and education was  made to take first rank in their minds. Her sense of duty to them was  strong; she frequently said: \"I live and save and slave for my  children.\" Fred, as we have seen, was her weakness. For him she broke  every rule and law of her life.    At forty-five she was thin, her face already deeply seamed with worry  lines, a veritable slave to her home, but an autocrat to servants,  agents and merchants. They said her will was strong; at least,  excepting Fred, she had never been known to give in to any one. We  have not spoken of Mary. Poor woman! She, too, was a slave--she was  the hired girl. Meek almost to automatism, a machine which never  varied from one year's end to another, faithful as the proverbial dog,  she noiselessly slipped through her unceasing round of duties for  twenty-three years--then catastrophe. \"That fool hired man has  hoodwinked Mary.\" No wedding gift, no note of well-wishing, but a  rabid bundling out of her effects. Howbeit, Central Ohio could not  produce another Mary, and from then on a new interest was added to the  Claytons' table-talk as one servant followed another into the Mother's  bad graces. She was already worn to a feather-edge before Mary's  ingratitude. But the shock of Fred's death completed the  demoralization of wrongly lived years. For weeks she railed at a  society which did not protect its citizens, at a church which failed  to make men good, while she now recognized a God against whom she  could express resentment.    This woman endowed with an excellent physical and mental organization  had allowed her ability and capacity to become perverted. Orderliness,  at first a well planned daily routine, gradually degenerated into an  obsession for cleanliness. Each piece of furniture went through its  weekly polishing, rugs were swept and dusted, sponged and sunned--even  Mary could not do the table-linen to her taste--and Tuesday afternoon  through the years went to immaculate ironing. The obsession for  cleanliness bred a fear of uncleanliness, and for years each dish was  examined by reflected light, to be condemned by one least streak. The  milk and butter especially must receive care equaled only by surgical  asepsis. Then there were the doors. The front door was for company,  and then only for the elect--and Fred; the side door was for the  family, and woe to the neighbor's child or the green delivery boy who  tracked mud through this portal. No amount of foot-wiping could render  the hired man fit for the kitchen steps after milking time--he used a  step-ladder to bring up the milk to the back porch. Such intensity of  attention to detail could not long fail to make this degenerating  neurotic take note of her own body, which gradually became more and  more sensitive, till she was fairly distraught between her fear of  draughts and her mania for ventilation. It was windows up and windows  down, opening the dampers and closing the dampers, something for her  shoulders and more fresh air. Church, lecture-halls and theaters  gradually became impossible. Finally she was practically a prisoner in  the semiobscurity of her home--a prisoner to bodily sensation. Then  came the autos to curse. The Clayton home was within a hundred yards  of the county road, and when the wind was from the west really visible  dust from passing motors presumed to invade the sanctity of parlor and  spare rooms, and with kindling resentment windows were closed and  windows were opened, rooms were dusted and redusted until she hated  the sound of an auto-horn, until the smell of burning gasoline caused  her nausea--but each year the autos multiplied.    At last the family realized that her loss of control was becoming  serious, that she was really a sufferer; but her antagonism to  physicians was deep-set, so the osteopath was called. Had he been  given a fair chance, he might have helped, but her obsessions were  such that she resented the touch of his manipulations, fearing that  some unknown infection might exude from his palms to her undoing.  Reason finally became helpless in the grip of her phobias. Her stomach  lining was \"destroyed,\" and into this \"raw stomach\" only the rarest of  foods and those of her own preparation could be taken. She had fainted  at Fred's funeral, and repeatedly became dazed, practically  unconscious, at the mention of his"]]]
