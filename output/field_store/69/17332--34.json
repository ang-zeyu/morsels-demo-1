Thus there is the correctional school,  which Roeder brought into special prominence not many years ago.  But though it flourished in Germany, less in Italy and France, and  somewhat more in Spain, it had no long existence as an independent  school, for it was only too easily confuted by the close sequence  of inexorable facts.  Moreover, it could do no more than oppose a  few humanitarian arguments on the reformation of offenders to the  traditional arguments of the theories of jurisprudence, of  absolute and relative justice, of intimidation, utility, and the  like.    No doubt the principle that punishment ought to have a reforming  effect upon the criminal survives as a rudimentary organ in nearly  all the schools which concern themselves with crime.  But this is  only a secondary principle, and as it were the indirect object of  punishment; and besides, the observations of anthropology,  psychology, and criminal statistics have finally disposed of it,  having established the fact that, under any system of punishment,  with the most severe or the most indulgent methods, there are  always certain types of criminals, representing a large number of  individuals, in regard to whom amendment is simply impossible, or  very transitory, on account of their organic and moral  degeneration.  Nor must we forget that, since the natural roots of  crime spring not only from the individual organism, but also, in  large measure, from its physical and social environment,  <p xix>correction of the individual is not sufficient to prevent  relapse if we do not also, to the best of our ability, reform the  social environment.  The utility and the duty of reformation none  the less survive, even for the positive school, whenever it is  possible, and for certain classes of criminals; but, as a  fundamental principle of a scientific theory, it has passed away.    Hitherto, then, the classical school stands alone, with varying  shades of opinion, but one and distinct as a method, and as a body  of principles and consequences.  And whilst it has achieved its  aim in the most recent penal codes, with a great, and too  frequently an excessive diminution of punishments, so in respect  of theory, in Italy, Germany, and France it has crowned its work  with a series of masterpieces amongst which I will only mention  Carrara's ``Programme of Criminal Law.''  As the author tells us  in one of his later editions, from the <_a!> priori_ principle  that ``crime is a fact dependent upon law, an infraction rather  than an action,'' he deduced--and that by the sheer force of an  admirable logic--a complete symmetrical scheme of legal and  abstract consequences, wherein judges are compelled, whether they  like it or not, to determine the position of every criminal who  comes before them.    But now the classical school, which sprang from the marvellous  little work of Beccaria, has completed its historic cycle.  It has  yielded all it could, and writers of the present day who still  cling to it can only recast the old material.  The youngest of  them, indeed, are condemned to a sort of Byzantine discussion of  <p xx>scholastic formulas, and to a sterile process of scientific  rumination.    And meantime, outside our universities and academies, criminality  continues to grow, and the punishments hitherto inflicted, though  they can neither protect nor indemnify the honest, succeed in  corrupting and degrading evil-doers.  And whilst our treatises and  codes (which are too often mere treatises cut up into segments)  lose themselves in the fog of their legal abstractions, we feel  more strongly every day, in police courts and at assizes, the  necessity for those biological and sociological studies of crime  and criminals which, when logically directed, can throw light as  nothing else can upon the administration of  the penal law.        CHAPTER I.    THE DATA OF CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.    THE experimental school of criminal sociology took its original  title from its studies of anthropology; it is still commonly  regarded as little more than a ``criminal anthropology school.''  And though this title no longer corresponds with the development  of the school, which also takes into account and investigates the  data of psychology, statistics, and sociology, it is none the less  true that the most characteristic impetus of the new scientific  movement was due to anthropological studies.  This was  conspicuously the case when Lombroso, giving a scientific form to  sundry scattered and fragmentary observations upon criminals,  added fresh life to them by a collection of inquiries which were  not only original but also governed by a distinct idea, and  established the new science of criminal anthropology.    It is possible, of course, to discover a very early origin for  criminal anthropology, as for general anthropology; for, as Pascal  said, man has always been the most wonderful object of study to  himself.  For observations on physiognomy in particular we may go  as far backwards as to Plato, and his comparisons of the human  face and character with those<p 1> of the brutes, or even to  Aristotle, who still earlier observed the physical and  psychological correspondence between the passions of men and their  facial expression.  And after the medi<ae>val gropings in  chiromancy, metoscopy, podomancy and so forth, one comes to the  seventeenth century studies in physiognomy by the Jesuit  Niquetius, by Cortes, Cardanus, De la Chambre, Della Porta, &c.,  who were precursors of Gall, Spurzheim, and Lavater on one side,  and, on the other, of the modern scientific study of the emotions,  with their expression in face and gesture, conducted by Camper,  Bell, Engel, Burgess, Duchenne, Gratiolet, Piderit, Mantegazza,  Schaffhausen, Schack, Heiment, and above all by Darwin.    With regard to the special observation of criminals, over and  above the limited statements of the old physiognomists and  phrenologists, Lauvergne (1841) in France and Attomyr (1842) in  Germany had accurately applied the theories of Gall to the  examination of convicts; and their works, in spite of certain  exaggerations of phrenology, are still a valuable treasury of  observations in anthropology.  In Italy, De Rolandis (1835) had  published his observations on a deceased criminal; in America,  Sampson (1846) had traced the connection between criminality and  cerebral organisation; in Germany, Camper (1854) published a study  on the physiognomy of murderers; and Ave Lallemant (1858-62)  produced a long work on criminals, from the psychological point of  view.    But the science of criminal anthropology, more <p 3>strictly  speaking, only begins with the observations of English gaol  surgeons and other learned men, such as Forbes Winslow (1854),  Mayhew (1860), Thomson (1870), Wilson (1870), Nicolson (1872),  Maudsley (1873), and with the very notable work of Despine (1868),  which indeed gave rise to the inquiries of Thomson, and which, in  spite of its lack of synthetic treatment and systematic unity, is  still, taken in conjunction with the work of Ave Lallemant, the  most important inquiry in the psychological domain anterior to the  work of Lombroso.    Nevertheless, it was only with the first edition of ``The  Criminal'' (1876) that criminal anthropology asserted itself as an  independent science, distinct from the main trunk of general  anthropology, itself quite recent in its origin, having come into  existence with the works of Daubenton, Blumenbach, Soemmering,  Camper, White, and Pritchard.    The work of Lombroso set out with two original faults: the mistake  of having given undue importance, at any rate apparently, to the  data of craniology and anthropometry, rather than to those of  psychology; and, secondly, that of having mixed up, in the first  two editions, all criminals in a single class.  In later editions  these defects were eliminated, Lombroso having adopted the  observation which I made in the first instance, as to the various  anthropological categories of criminals.  This does not prevent  certain critics of criminal anthropology from repeating, with a  strange monotony, the venerable objections as to the  ``impossibility of distinguishing a criminal from an honest man by  the shape of his skull,'' or of <p 4>``measuring human  responsibility in accordance with different craniological  types.''[2]      [2] Vol. ii. of the fourth edition of ``The Criminal'' (1889) is  specially concerned with the epileptic and idiotic criminal  (referred to alcoholism, hysteria, mattoidism) whether occasional  or subject to violent impulse; whilst vol. i. is concerned only  with congenital criminality and moral insanity.      But these original faults in no way obscure the two following  noteworthy facts--that within a few years after the publication of  ``The Criminal'' there were published, in Italy and elsewhere, a  whole library of studies in criminal anthropology, and that a new  school has been established, having a distinct method and  scientific developments, which are no longer to be looked for in  the classical school of criminal law.      I.      What, then, is criminal anthropology?  And of what nature are its  fundamental data, which lead us up to the general conclusions of  criminal sociology?    If general anthropology is, according to the definition of M. de  Quatrefages, the natural history of man, as zoology is the natural  history of animals, criminal anthropology is but the study of a  single variety of mankind.  In other words, it is the natural  history of the criminal man.    Criminal anthropology studies the criminal man in his organic and  psychical constitution, and in his life as related to his physical  and social environment--just as anthropology has done for man in  general, and for the various races of mankind.

BIRTH AND GENEALOGY, 1807.    A Chosen Spirit.--Divine Guidance.--Genealogy.--A Miller by Trade.    Wilford Woodruff was the fourth president of the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints. He belonged to that class of men of whom the  Lord said to Abraham, \"These will I make my rulers.\" Of our primeval  childhood that ancient Prophet informs us that the Lord stood among  those that were spirits and He saw that they were good. Of these  spirits the Lord said to Abraham, \"Thou art one of them, thou wert  chosen before thou wast born.\" If the Lord knew Abraham and Jeremiah  before they were born in the flesh, He also must have known Wilford  Woodruff in the spirit world. The latter's integrity and unbounded  devotion to the worship and purposes of his God are not surpassed by  any prophet of either ancient or modern times. Like those of ancient  times, Wilford Woodruff was undoubtedly foreordained of God to a noble  mission in life, and to the great responsibilities which he filled  with honor and to the glory of God. To him there was a reality of the  spirit world rarely enjoyed by men, he constantly felt the influence of  spiritual associations which were above and beyond the ordinary affairs  of life. That he had an existence prior to this probation in life, he  never doubted. He felt that life was a mission to which he had been  called and which in the goodness of God he had been permitted to fill.  His own spiritual existence was never overshadowed by temporalities or  by constant misgivings that so frequently beset the lives of other men.    Wilford Woodruff looked upon the brotherhood of men as {2} a natural  sequence of his assurance that God was the Father of our spirits in  a former life. He understood that prayer of the Savior addressing  Himself to His Father in heaven. His own spirit was in harmony with the  revelations of Christ. In the light of scriptural declarations and of  his own spiritual nature, he was simply here in life in the performance  of great duties which had been assigned him before the world was. He  sincerely believed that in returning again to the God who had given him  life he would have to account for his talents and his time. Speaking  of the Athenians, Paul said: \"God that made the world hath made of  one blood all nations of men to dwell on the face of the earth, and  hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their  habitation.\"    In the life of Wilford Woodruff there was unfolded day by day the  duties and obligations that linked him with the chain of eternal life.  When the new revelation of God to men in this dispensation broke in  upon him he was happily prepared to enjoy the new light. To be a  Latter-day Saint from the outset seemed as natural as to breathe the  air of heaven. He marvelled at the purposes of God but did not wonder,  and doubt did not obscure from his vision the divine truth of this  dispensation while he sojourned in the flesh. The love of God had  always abounded in his heart, and the divine message found him eager  and willing.    He was not among those who sought divine assurance and spiritual  satisfaction in some one creed of the day. The Bible was his highest  authority and he believed implicitly in the divinity of its teachings.  He was a devoted student of Holy Writ and prayerfully sought the gifts  and blessings bestowed upon the Saints of old. He was waiting for  precisely that which came to him and he took up the new mission of life  with a strenuous desire to serve God and to be a witness that he was  the same God yesterday, to-day, and forever.    The story of Wilford Woodruff's life was consistent, faithful and in  harmony with scriptural examples. The dealings of God with His children  in other dispensations were always before his mind as illustrations  and evidences. If the Bible had been"]]]
