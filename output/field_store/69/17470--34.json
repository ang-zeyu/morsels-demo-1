And now I began to suspect that they were not quite so undisturbed  as the old dame had led me to believe; that they had not found a  paradise in the village after all. One morning, as I moved softly along  the hedge in my nightingale's lane, all at once I heard, in the old  grassy orchard, to which it formed a boundary, swishing sounds of  scuttling feet and half-suppressed exclamations of alarm; then a  crushing through the hedge, and out, almost at my feet, rushed and  leaped and tumbled half-a-dozen urchins, who had suddenly been  frightened from a bird-nesting raid. Clothes torn, hands and faces  scratched with thorns, hat-less, their tow-coloured hair all disordered  or standing up like a white crest above their brown faces, rounded eyes  staring--what an extraordinarily wild appearance they had! I was back  in very old times, in the Britain of a thousand years before the coming  of the Romans, and these were her young barbarians, learning their  life's business in little things.    No, the birds of the village were not undisturbed while breeding; but  happily the young savages never found my nightingale's nest. One day the  bird came to the gate as usual, and was more alert and pugnacious than  ever; and no wonder, for his mate came too, and with them four young  birds. For a week they were about the cottage every day, when they  dispersed, and one beautiful bright morning the male bird, in his old  place near my window, attempted to sing, beginning with that rich,  melodious throbbing, which is usually called \"_jugging_,\" and following  with half-a-dozen beautiful notes. That was all. It was July, and I  heard no more music from him or from any other of his kind.    * * *    I have perhaps written at too great length of this bird. The nightingale  was after all only one of the fifty-nine species I succeeded in  identifying during my sojourn at the village. There were more. I heard  the calls and cries of others in the wood and various places, but  refused, except in the case of the too elusive crake, to set down any in  my list that I did not see. It was not my ambition to make a long list.  My greatest desire was to see well those that interested me most. But  those who go forth, as I did, to look for birds that are a sight for  sore eyes, must meet with many a disappointment. In all those fruit and  shade trees that covered the village with a cloud of verdure, and in the  neighbouring woods, not once did I catch a glimpse of the green  woodpecker, a beautiful conspicuous bird, supposed to be increasing in  many places in England. Its absence from so promising a locality seemed  strange.  Another species, also said to be increasing in the  country--the turtledove, was extremely abundant. In the tall beech woods  its low, monotonous crooning note was heard all day long from all sides.  In shady places, where the loud, shrill bird-voices are few, one prefers  this sound to the set song of the woodpigeon, being more continuous and  soothing, and of the nature of a lullaby. It sometimes reminded me of  the low monotone I have heard from a Patagonian mother when singing her  \"swart papoose\" to sleep. Still, I would gladly have spared many of  these woodland crooners for the sake of one magpie--that bird of fine  feathers and a bright mind, which I had not looked on for a whole year,  and now hoped to see again. But he was not there; and after I had looked  for myself, some of the natives assured me that no magpie had been seen  for years in that wood.    For a time I feared that I was to be just as unlucky with regard to the  jay, seeing that the owner of the extensive beech woods adjoining the  village permitted his keeper to kill the most interesting birds in  it--kestrels and sparrowhawks, owls, jays, and magpies. He was a new  man, comparatively, in the place, and wanted to increase his preserves,  but to do this it was necessary first to exclude the villagers--the  Badgers, who were no doubt partial to pheasants' eggs. Now, to close an  ancient right-of-way is a ticklish business, and this was an important  one, seeing that the village women did their Saturday marketing in the  town beyond the wood and river, and with the path closed they would have  two miles further to walk. The new lord wisely took this into  consideration, and set himself to win the goodwill of the people before  attempting any strong measures. He walked in the lanes and was affable  to the cottage women and nice to the children, and by and bye he  exclaimed, \"What! No institute! no hall, or any place where you can meet  and spend the long winter evenings? Well, I'll soon see to that.\" And  soon, to their delight, they had a nice building reared on a piece of  land which he bought for the purpose, furnished with tables, chairs,  bagatelle boards, and all accessories; and he also supplied them with  newspapers and magazines. He was immensely popular, but appeared to  think little of what he had done. When they expressed their gratitude to  him he would move his hand, and answer, \"Oh, I'm going to do a great  deal more than that for you!\"    A few months went by, then he caused a notice to be put up about the  neighbourhood that the path through the wood was going to be closed \"by  order.\" No one took any notice, and a few weeks later his workmen  appeared on the scene and erected a huge oakwood barrier across the  path; also a notice on a board that the wood was strictly private and  trespassers would be prosecuted. The villagers met in force at the  institute and the inn that evening, and after discussing the matter over  their ale, they armed themselves with axes and went in a body and  demolished the barrier.    The owner was disgusted, but took no action. \"This,\" he said, \"is their  gratitude\"; and from that day he ceased to subscribe to the local  charities or take his walks in the village. He had given the institute,  and so could not pull it down nor prevent them from using it.    It was refreshing to hear that the Badgers had shown a proper spirit in  the matter, and I was grateful to them for having kept the right-of-way,  as on most days I spent several hours in the beautiful woods.    To return to the jay. In spite of the keeper's persecution, I knew that  he was there; every morning when I got up to look out of the window  between four and five o'clock, I heard from some quarter of the village  that curious subdued, but far-reaching, scolding note he is accustomed  to utter when his suspicions have been aroused.    That was the jay's custom--to come from the woods before even the  earliest risers were up, and forage in the village. By and bye I  discovered that, by lying motionless for an hour or so on the dry moss  in the wood, he would at length grow so bold as to allow himself to be  seen, but high up among the topmost branches. Then, by means of my  binocular, I had the wild thing on my thumb, so to speak, exhibiting  himself to me, inquisitive, perplexed, suspicious, enraged by turns, as  he flirted wings and tail, lifted and lowered his crest, glancing down  with bright, wild eyes. What a beautiful hypocrisy and delightful power  this is which enables us, sitting or lying motionless, feigning sleep  perhaps, thus to fool this wild, elusive creature, and bring all its  cunning to naught! He is so much smaller and keener-sighted, able to  fly, to perch far up above me, to shift his position every minute or  two, masking his small figure with this or that tuft of leaves, while  still keeping his eyes on me--in spite of it all to have him so close,  and without moving or taking any trouble, to see him so much better than  he can see me! But this is a legitimate trickery of science, so innocent  that we can laugh at our dupe when we practise it; nor do we afterwards  despise our superior cunning and feel ashamed, as when we slaughter wild  birds with far-reaching shot, which they cannot escape.    * * *    All these corvine birds, which the gamekeeper pursues so relentlessly,  albeit they were before him, killing when they killed to better purpose;  and, let us hope, will exist after him--all these must greatly surpass  other kinds in sagacity to have escaped extermination. In the present  condition of things, the jay is perhaps the best off, on account of his  smaller size and less conspicuous colouring; but whether more cunning  than the crow or magpie or not, in perpetual alertness and restless  energy or intensity of life, he is without an equal among British birds.  And this quality forms his chief attraction; it is more to the mind than  his lifted crest and bright eyes, his fine vinaceous brown and the patch  of sky-blue on his wings. One would miss him greatly from the woods;  some of the melody may well be spared for the sake of the sudden,  brain-piercing, rasping, rending scream with which he startles us in our  solitary forest walks.    It is this extreme liveliness of the jay which makes it more distressing  to the mind to see it pent in a cage than other birds of its family,  such as the magpie; just as it is more distressing to see a skylark than  a finch in prison, because the lark has an irresistible impulse to rise  when his singing fit is on. Sing he must, in or out of prison, yet there  can be little joy in the performance when the bird is incessantly teased  with the unsatisfied desire to mount and pour out his music at heaven's  gate.    Out of the cages, jays make charming and beautiful pets, and some who  have kept them have assured me that they are not mischievous birds. The  late Mark Melford one time when I visited him, had two jays, handsome  birds, in bright, glossy plumage, always free to roam where they liked,  indoors or out. We were sitting talking in his garden when one of the  jays came flying to us and perched on a wooden ledge a few feet from and  above our heads, and after sitting quietly for a little while he  suddenly made a dash"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7386"],[0,"Egyptian Tales, Translated from the Papyri: First series, IVth to XIIth dynasty (#3)"],[1,"ought, and its head cast on the ground. And Dedi spake his magic  speech. And the ox stood upright behind him, and followed him with his  halter trailing on the ground.    And King Khufu said, \"And is it true what is said, that thou knowest the  number of the designs of the dwelling of Tahuti?\" And Dedi replied,  \"Pardon me, I know not their number, O king (life, wealth, and health),  but I know where they are.\" And his majesty said, \"Where is that?\" And  Dedi replied, \"There is a chest of whetstone in a chamber named the  plan-room, in Heli-opolis; they are in this chest.\" And Dedi said  further unto him, \"O king (life, wealth, and health), my lord, it is not  I that is to bring them to thee.\" And his m'jesty said, \"Who, then, is  it that shall bring them to me?\" And Dedi answered to him, \"It is the  eldest of the three children who are in the body of Rud-didet who  shall bring them to thee.\" And his majesty said, \"Would that it may be  as thou sayest! And who is this Rud-didet?\" And Dedi replied, \"She is  the wife of a priest of Ra, lord of Sakhebu. And she has conceived  these three sons by Ra, lord of Sakhebu, and the god has promised her  that they shall fulfil this noble office (of reigning) over all this  land, and that the eldest of them shall be high priest in Heliopolis.\"  And his majesty's heart became troubled for this; but Dedi spake unto  him, \"What is this that thou thinkest, O king (life, wealth, health),  my lord? Is it because of these three children? I tell thee thy son  shall reign, and thy son's son, and then one of them.\" His majesty  said, \"And when shall Rud-didet bear these?\" And he replied, \"She  shall bear them on the 26th of the month Tybi.\" And his majesty said,  \"When the banks of the canal of Letopolis are cut, I will walk there  that I may see the temple of Ra, lord of Sakhebu.\" And Dedi replied,  \"Then I will cause that there be four cubits of water by the banks of  the canal of Letopolis.\" When his majesty returned to his palace, his  majesty said, \"Let them place Dedi in the house of the royal son  Hordedef, that he may dwell with him, and let them give him a daily  portion of a thousand loaves, a hundred draughts of beer, an ox, and a  hundred bunches of onions.\" And they did everything as his majesty  commanded.    And one day it came to pass that Rud-didet felt the pains of birth. And  the majesty of Ra, lord of Sakhebu, said unto Isis, to Nebhat, to  Meskhent, to Hakt, and to Khnumu, \"Go ye, and deliver Rud-didet of these  three children that she shall bear, who are to fulfil this noble office  over all this land; that they may build up your temples, furnish your  altars with offerings, supply your tables of libation, and increase your  endowments.\" Then went these deities; their fashion they made as that of  dancing-girls, and Khnumu was with them as a porter. They drew near  unto the house of Ra-user, and found him standing, with his girdle  fallen. And they played before him with their instruments of music.  But he said unto them, \"My ladies, behold, here is a woman who feels  the pains of birth.\" They said to him, \"Let us see her, for we know  how to help her.\" And he replied, \"Come, then.\" And they entered in  straightway to Rud-didet, and they closed the door on her and on  themselves. Then Isis stood before her, and Nebhat stood behind her,  and Hakt helped her. And Isis said, \"O child, by thy name of User-ref,  do not do violence.\" And the child came upon her hands, as a child of  a cubit; its bones were strong, the beauty of its limbs was like gold,  and its hair was like true lapis lazuli. They washed him, and prepared  him, and placed him on a carpet on the brickwork. Then Meskhent  approached him and said, \"This is a king who shall reign over all the  land.\" And Khnumu gave strength to his limbs. Then Isis stood before  her, and Nebhat stood behind her, and Hakt helped her.  And Isis said,  \"O child, by thy name of Sah-ra, stay not in her.\" Then the child came  upon her hands, a child of a cubit; its bones were strong, the beauty  of its limbs was like gold, and its hair was like true lapis lazuli.  They washed him, and prepared him, and layed him on a carpet on the  brickwork. Then Meskhent approached him and said, \"This is a king who  shall reign over all the land.\" And Khnumu gave strength to his limbs.  Then Isis stood before her, and Nebhat stood behind her, and Hakt  helped her. And Isis said, \"O child, by thy name of Kaku, remain not  in darkness in her.\" And the child came upon her hands, a child of a  cubit; its bones were strong, the beauty of its limbs was like gold,  and its hair was like true lapis lazuli. And Meskhent approached him  and said, \"This is a king who shall reign over all the land.\" And  Khnumu gave strength to his limbs.  And they washed him, and prepared  him, and layed him on a carpet on the brickwork.    And the deities went out, having delivered Rud-didet of the three  children. And they said, \"Rejoice! O Ra-user, for behold three children  are born unto thee.\" And he said unto them, \"My ladies, and what shall I  give unto ye? Behold, give this bushel of barley here unto your porter,  that ye may take it as your reward to the brew-house.\" And Khnumu loaded  himself with the bushel of barley. And they went away toward the place  from which they came. And Isis spake unto these goddesses, and said,  \"Wherefore have we come without doing a marvel for these children, that  we may tell it to their father who has sent us?\" Then made they the  divine diadems of the king (life, wealth, and health), and laid them in  the bushel of barley. And they caused the clouds to come with wind and  rain; and they turned back again unto the house. And they said, \"Let us  put this barley in a closed chamber, sealed up, until we return  northward, dancing.\" And they placed the barley in a close chamber.    And Rud-didet purified herself, with a purification of fourteen days.  And she said to her handmaid, \"Is the house made ready?\" And she  replied, \"All things are made ready, but the brewing barley is not yet  brought.\" And Rud-didet said, \"Wherefore is the brewing barley not yet  brought?\" And the servant answered, \"It would all of it long since  be ready if the barley had not been given to the dancing-girls, and lay  in the chamber under their seal.\" Rud didet said, \"Go down, and bring of  it, and Ra-user shall give them in its stead when he shall come,\" And  the handmaid went, and opened the chamber. And she heard talking and  singing, music and dancing, quavering, and all things which are  performed for a king in his chamber. And she returned and told to  Rud-didet all that she had heard. And she went through the chamber, but  she found not the place where the sound was. And she layed her temple to  the sack, and found that the sounds were in it. She placed it in a  chest, and put that in another locker, and tied it fast with leather,  and layed it in the store-room, where the things were, and sealed it.  And Ra-user came returning from the field; and Rud-didet repeated unto  him these things; and his heart was glad above all things; and they sat  down and made a joyful day.    And after these days it came to pass that Rud-didet was wroth with her  servant, and beat her with stripes. And the servant said unto those that  were in the house, \"Shall it be done thus unto me? She has borne three  kings, and I will go and tell this to his majesty King Khufu the  blessed.\" And she went, and found the eldest brother of her mother, who  was binding his flax on the floor. And he said to her, \"Whither goest  thou, my little maid?\" And she told him of all these things. And her  brother said to her, \"Wherefore comest thou thus to me?  Shall I agree  to treachery?\" And he took a bunch of the flax to her, and laid on  her a violent blow. And the servant went to fetch a handful of water,  and a crocodile carried her away.    Her uncle went therefore to tell of this to Rud-didet; and he found  Rud-didet sitting, her head on her knees, and her heart beyond measure  sad. And he said to her, \"My lady, why makest thou thy heart thus?\" And  she answered, \"It is because of this little wretch that was in the  house; behold she went out saying, 'I will go and tell it.'\" And he  bowed his head unto the ground, and said, \"My lady, she came and told me  of these things, and made her complaint unto me; and I laid on her a  violent blow. And she went forth to draw water, and a crocodile carried  her away.\"    _(The rest of the tale is lost.)_          Remarks      The tales or the magicians are only preserved in a single copy, and of  that the beginning is entirely lost. The papyrus was brought from Egypt  by an English traveller, and was purchased by the Berlin Museum from the  property of Lepsius, who had received it from the owner, Miss Westcar:  hence it is known as the Westcar papyrus. It was written probably in the  XIIth Dynasty, but doubtless embodied tales, which had been floating  for generations before, about the names of the early kings. It shows us  probably the kind of material that existed for the great recension of  the pre-monu-mental history, made in the time of Seti I. Those ages of  the first three dynasties were as long before that recension as we are  after it; and this must always be remembered in considering the  authority of the Egyptian records.    This papyrus has been more thoroughly studied than most, perhaps more  than any other. Erman has devoted two volumes to it; publishing the  whole in photographic facsimile, transcribed in hieroglyphs,  transcribed in the modern alphabet, translated literally, translated  freely, commented on and discussed word by word, and with a complete  glossary of all words used in it. This exhaustive publication is named  \"Der Marchen des Papyrus Westcar.\" Moreover, Maspero has given a  current translation in the \"Contes Populaires,\" 2nd edit. pp. 53-86.
