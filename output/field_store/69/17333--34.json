Volume Three concludes, for the present, the history of the Church in  Missouri. I think it proper, therefore, that here should be considered  the causes of the Missouri persecutions, which resulted in the  expulsion of the entire Church from that state.    There have been, of course, more extensive persecutions than those  inflicted on the Saints in Missouri; but I doubt if there has ever been  a persecution more cruel or terror-laden in its character. Viewed from  the standpoint of its net results there were some fifty people, men,  women, and children, killed outright; about as many more were wounded  or cruelly beaten, and many more perished indirectly because of the  exposure to which they were subjected through the winters of 1833-4 and  1838-9.    In round numbers it is estimated that between twelve and fifteen  thousand people, citizens of the United States, after being  dispossessed of their lands, were forcibly driven from the state.  It is known that they paid to the United States government for land  alone, three hundred and eighteen thousand dollars, which, at the  minimum price of one dollar and a quarter per acre, would give them  land holdings of over two hundred and fifty thousand acres, which  represented for that day very large interests. [1]    To this list of results must be added the more horrible one of several  cases of ravishment at Far West; and also, after barely escaping  from the sentence of death pronounced by a court martial, the cruel  imprisonment through weary months of a number of Church leaders.    In passing judgment upon such matters as these account must be taken of  the age and country in which they occurred; likewise the pretensions  to right views of life, and devotion to freedom on the part of the  perpetrators of the injustice. Undoubtedly a heavier debt is incurred  to history, to humanity and to God, when the parties who resort to such  acts of mob violence and injustice live in an enlightened age, and  where the free institutions of their country guarantee both the freedom  and security of its citizens.    {XVIII} If in the jungle a man meets a tiger and is torn to pieces, no  one thinks of holding the tiger to any moral accountability. Perhaps  the hunt will be formed to destroy the beast, but that is merely to be  rid of a dangerous animal, and prevent the repetition of the deed. If  another meets a cruel death among savages in heathen lands, while some  moral responsibility would hold against them, according to their degree  of enlightenment, yet the fact that it was an act of savages would be  held to reduce the degree of moral turpitude. And likewise even in  civilized states, in localities to which the vicious may gravitate,  when acts of violence are committed there, some allowance may be, and  generally is, made for the ignorance and general brutality of the  particular neighborhood.    By this process of reasoning I think it will appear quite clear that  moral responsibility, both on the part of individuals and communities  or nations, increases in proportion to their enlightenment. If,  therefore, this principle be kept in view, the persecution of the  Latter-day Saints by the people of Missouri was a very heinous offense.    True it may be said that the worst acts of cruelty were perpetrated  by low, brutish men among the mob or in the militia--for these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47708"],[0,"Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow (#3)"],[1,"lfilled.--Sermon on the ship.--An earthquake.--Return  home.--Interview with President Young.
