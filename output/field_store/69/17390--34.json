But next morning they all came  back again to Owl Island; and  Twinkleberry and the others brought  a fine fat mole, and laid it on the  stone in front of Old Brown's  doorway, and said--    \"Mr. Brown, will you favour us with  your gracious permission to gather  some more nuts?\"    But Nutkin, who had no respect,  began to dance up and down, tickling  old Mr. Brown with a NETTLE and  singing--              \"Old Mr. B! Riddle-me-ree!            Hitty Pitty within the wall,            Hitty Pitty without the wall;            If you touch Hitty Pitty,            Hitty Pitty will bite you!\"      Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and  carried the mole into his house.      He shut the door in Nutkin's face.  Presently a little thread of blue SMOKE  from a wood fire came up from the  top of the tree, and Nutkin peeped  through the key-hole and sang--              \"A house full, a hole full!            And you cannot gather a bowl-full!\"      The squirrels searched for nuts all  over the island and filled their little  sacks.    But Nutkin gathered oak-apples--  yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a  beech-stump playing marbles, and  watching the door of old Mr. Brown.    On the third day the squirrels got  up very early and went fishing; they  caught seven fat minnows as a  present for Old Brown.    They paddled over the lake and  landed under a crooked chestnut tree  on Owl Island.      Twinkleberry and six other little  squirrels each carried a fat minnow;  but Nutkin, who had no nice  manners, brought no present at all.  He ran in front, singing--         \"The man in the wilderness said to me,       `How may strawberries grow in the sea?'       I answered him as I thought good--       `As many red herrings as grow in the wood.\"'      But old Mr. Brown took no interest  in riddles--not even when the answer  was provided for him.    On the fourth day the squirrels  brought a present of six fat beetles,  which were as good as plums in  PLUM-PUDDING for Old Brown. Each  beetle was wrapped up carefully in a  dockleaf, fastened with a pine-needle-  pin.    But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever--         \"Old Mr. B! riddle-me-ree!       Flour of England, fruit of Spain,       Met together in a shower of rain;       Put in a bag tied round with a string,       If you'll tell me this riddle,       I'll give you a ring!\"      Which was ridiculous of Nutkin,  because he had not got any ring to  give to Old Brown.    The other squirrels hunted up and  down the nut bushes; but Nutkin  gathered robin's pin-cushions off a  briar bush, and stuck them full of  pine-needle-pins.      On the fifth day the squirrels  brought a present of wild honey; it  was so sweet and sticky that they  licked their fingers as they put it down  upon the stone. They had stolen it out  of a bumble BEES' nest on the tippity  top of the hill.    But Nutkin skipped up and down,  singing--         \"Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! Hum-a-bum buzz!            As I went over Tipple-tine            I met a flock of bonny swine;       Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!            They were the very bonniest swine            That e'er went over the Tipple-tine.\"      Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes  in disgust at the impertinence of  Nutkin.    But he ate up the honey!    The squirrels filled their little sacks  with nuts.    But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock,  and played ninepins with a crab apple  and green fir-cones.      On the sixth day, which was  Saturday, the squirrels came again for  the last time; they brought a new-laid  EGG in a little rush basket as a last  parting present for Old Brown.    But Nutkin ran in front laughing,  and shouting--         \"Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck,       With a white counterpane round his neck,       Forty doctors and forty wrights,       Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!\"      Now old Mr. Brown took an interest  in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it  again. But still he did not speak.    Nutkin became more and more  impertinent--         \"Old Mr. B! Old Mr. B!       Hickamore, Hackamore, on the King's            kitchen door;       All the King's horses, and all the King's men,       Couldn't drive Hickamore, Hackamore,       Off the King's kitchen door!\"      Nutkin danced up and down like a  SUNBEAM; but still Old Brown said  nothing at all.    Nutkin began again--         \"Authur O'Bower has broken his band,       He comes roaring up the land!       The King of Scots with all his power,       Cannot turn Arthur of the Bower!\"      Nutkin made a whirring noise to  sound like the WIND, and he took a  running jump right onto the head of  Old Brown! . . .    Then all at once there was a  flutterment and a scufflement and a  loud \"Squeak!\"    The other squirrels scuttered away  into the bushes.    When they came back very  cautiously, peeping round the tree--  there was Old Brown sitting on his  door-step, quite still, with his eyes  closed, as if nothing had happened.     * * * * * * * *    BUT NUTKIN WAS IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET!    This looks like the end of the story;  but it isn't.      Old Brown carried Nutkin into his  house, and held him up by the tail,  intending to skin him; but Nutkin  pulled so very hard that his tail broke  in two, and he dashed up the  staircase, and escaped out of the attic  window.    And to this day, if you meet Nutkin  up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will  throw sticks at you, and stamp his  feet and scold, and shout--    \"Cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k!\"          THE TALE OF  BENJAMIN BUNNY      [For the Children of Sawrey  from Old Mr. Bunny]          One morning a little rabbit sat on a  bank.    He pricked his ears and listened to  the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.    A gig was coming along the road; it  was driven by Mr. McGregor, and  beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her  best bonnet.    As soon as they had passed, little  Benjamin Bunny slid down into the  road, and set off--with a hop, skip,  and a jump--to call upon his  relations, who lived in the wood at the  back of Mr. McGregor's garden.    That wood was full of rabbit holes;  and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all  lived Benjamin's aunt and his  cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail,  and Peter.    Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she  earned her living by knitting  rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (I  once bought a pair at a bazaar). She  also sold herbs, and rosemary tea,  and rabbit-tobacco (which is what  we call lavender).      Little Benjamin did not very much  want to see his Aunt.    He came round the back of the fir-  tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top  of his Cousin Peter.    Peter was sitting by himself. He  looked poorly, and was dressed in a  red cotton pocket-handkerchief.    \"Peter,\" said little Benjamin, in a  whisper, \"who has got your clothes?\"    Peter replied, \"The scarecrow in Mr.  McGregor's garden,\" and described  how he had been chased about the  garden, and had dropped his shoes  and coat.    Little Benjamin sat down beside his  cousin and assured him that Mr.  McGregor had gone out in a gig, and  Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for  the day, because she was wearing her  best bonnet.      Peter said he hoped that it would  rain.    At this point old Mrs. Rabbit's voice  was heard inside the rabbit hole,  calling: \"Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! fetch  some more camomile!\"    Peter said he thought he might feel  better if he went for a walk.    They went away hand in hand, and  got upon the flat top of the wall at the  bottom of the wood. From here they  looked down into Mr. McGregor's  garden. Peter's coat and shoes were  plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow,  topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of  Mr. McGregor's.    Little Benjamin said: \"It spoils  people's clothes to squeeze under a  gate; the proper way to get in is to  climb down a pear-tree.\"    Peter fell down head first; but it  was of no consequence, as the bed  below was newly raked and quite  soft.    It had been sown with lettuces.    They left a great many odd little  footmarks all over the bed, especially  little Benjamin, who was wearing  clogs.    Little Benjamin said that the first  thing to be done was to get back  Peter's clothes, in order that they  might be able to use the pocket-  handkerchief.    They took them off the scarecrow.  There had been rain during the night;  there was water in the shoes, and the  coat was somewhat shrunk.    Benjamin tried on the tam-o'-  shanter, but it was too big for him.    Then he suggested that they should  fill the pocket-handkerchief with  onions, as a little present for his Aunt.    Peter did not seem to be enjoying  himself; he kept hearing noises.      Benjamin, on the contrary, was  perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce  leaf. He said that he was in the habit  of coming to the garden with his  father to get lettuces for their Sunday  dinner.    (The name of little Benjamin's papa  was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)    The lettuces certainly were very  fine.    Peter did not eat anything; he said  he should like to go home. Presently  he dropped half the onions.    Little Benjamin said that it was not  possible to get back up the pear-tree  with a load of vegetables. He led the  way boldly towards the other end of  the garden. They went along a little  walk on planks, under a sunny, red  brick wall.      The mice sat on their doorsteps  cracking cherry-stones; they winked  at Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin  Bunny.    Presently Peter let the pocket-  handkerchief go again.    They got amongst flower-pots, and  frames, and tubs. Peter heard noises  worse than ever; his eyes were as big  as lolly-pops!    He was a step or two in front of his  cousin when he suddenly stopped.    This is what those little rabbits saw  round that corner!    Little Benjamin took one look, and  then, in half a minute less than no  time, he hid himself and Peter and the  onions underneath a large basket. . . .      The cat got up and stretched  herself, and came and sniffed at the  basket.  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5747"],[0,"Do and Dare — a Brave Boy's Fight for Fortune (#3)"],[1,"r. He had the same features, and was quite as  mean, so far as others were concerned, but willing to spend money for  his own selfish pleasures. He was fond of playing pool, and cards, and  had contracted a dangerous fondness for whisky, which consumed all the  money he could spare from necessary expenses, and even more, so that, as  will presently appear, he failed to meet his board bills regularly.  Eben had served an apprenticeship in his father's store, having been,  in fact, Tom Tripp's predecessor; he tired of his father's strict  discipline, and the small pay out of which he was required to purchase  his clothes, and went to Boston to seek a wider sphere.    To do Eben justice, it must be admitted that he had good business  capacity, and if he had been able, like his father, to exercise  self-denial, and make money-getting his chief enjoyment, he would no  doubt have become a rich man in time. As it was, whenever he could make  his companions pay for his pleasures, he did so.    I now come to the letter which had brought disquietude to the  storekeeper.    It ran thus:    \"DEAR SIR: I understand that you are the father of Mr. Eben Graham,  who has been a boarder at my house for the last six months. I regret to  trouble you, but he is now owing me six weeks board, and I cannot get  a cent out of him, though he knows I am a poor widow, dependent on my  board money for my rent and house expenses. As he is a minor, the law  makes you responsible for his bills, and, though I dislike to trouble  you, I am obliged, in justice to myself, to ask you to settle his board  bill, which I inclose.    \"You will do me a great favor if you will send me the amount--thirty  dollars--within a week, as my rent is coming due.    \"Yours respectfully, SUSAN JONES.\"    The feelings of a man like Ebenezer Graham can be imagined when he read  this unpleasant missive.    \"Thirty dollars!\" he groaned. \"What can the graceless boy be thinking  of, to fool away his money, and leave his bills to be settled by me. If  this keeps on, I shall be ruined! It's too bad, when I am slaving here,  for Eben to waste my substance on riotous living. I've a great mind to  disown him. Let him go his own way, and fetch up in the poorhouse, if he  chooses.\"    But it is not easy for a man to cast off an only son, even though he is  as poorly supplied with natural affections as Ebenezer Graham. Besides,  Eben's mother interceded for him, and the father, in bitterness of  spirit, was about to mail a registered letter to Mrs. Jones, when the  cause of his anguish suddenly made his appearance in the store.    \"How are you, father?\" he said, nonchalantly, taking a cigar from his  mouth. \"Didn't expect to see me, did you?\"    \"What brings you here, Eben?\" asked Mr. Graham, uneasily.    \"Well, the cars brought me to Stockton, and I've walked the rest of the  way.\"    \"I've heard of you,\" said his father, frowning. \"I got a letter last  night from Mrs. Jones.\"    \"She said she was going to write,\" said Eben, shrugging his shoulders.    \"How came it,\" said his father, his voice trembling with anger, \"that  you haven't paid your board bill for six weeks?\"    \"I didn't have the money,\" said Eben, with a composure which was  positively aggravating to his father.    \"And why didn't you have the money? Your wages are ample to pay all your  expenses.\"    \"It costs more money to live in Boston than you think for, father.\"    \"Don't you get ten dollars a week, sir? At your age I got only seven,  and saved two dollars a week.\"    \"You didn't live in Boston, father.\"    \"I didn't smoke cigars,\" said his father, angrily, as he fixed his eye  on the one his son was smoking. \"How much did you pay for that miserable  weed?\"    \"You're mistaken, father. It's a very good article. I paid eight dollars  a hundred.\"    \"Eight dollars a hundred!\" gasped Mr. Graham. \"No wonder you can't pay  your board bill--I can't afford to spend my money on cigars.\"    \"Oh, yes, you can, father, if you choose. Why, you're a rich man.\"    \"A rich man!\" repeated Mr. Graham, nervously. \"It would take a rich man  to pay your bills. But you haven't told me why you have come home.\"    \"I lost my situation, father--some meddlesome fellow told my employer  that I occasionally played a game of pool, and my tailor came to the  store and dunned me; so old Boggs gave me a long lecture and my walking  papers, and here I am.\"    Ebenezer Graham was sorely troubled, and, though he isn't a favorite of  mine, I confess, that in this matter he has my sincere sympathy.          CHAPTER IV. HERBERT LOSES HIS PLACE.        Ebenezer Graham with some difficulty ascertained from Eben that he had  other bills, amounting in the aggregate to forty-seven dollars. This  added to the board bill, made a total of seventy-seven dollars. Mr.  Graham's face elongated perceptibly.    \"That is bad enough,\" he said; \"but you have lost your income also, and  that makes matters worse. Isn't there a chance of the firm taking you  back?\"    \"No, sir,\" replied the prodigal. \"You see, we had a flare up, and I  expressed my opinion of them pretty plainly. They wouldn't take me back  if I'd come for nothing.\"    \"And they won't give you a recommendation, either?\" said Ebenezer, with  a half groan.    \"No, sir; I should say not.\"    \"So you have ruined your prospects so far as Boston is concerned,\" said  his father, bitterly. \"May I ask how you expect to get along?\"    \"I have a plan,\" said Eben, with cheerful confidence.    \"What is it?\"    \"I would like to go to California. If I can't get any situation in San  Francisco, I can go to the mines.\"    \"Very fine, upon my word!\" said his father, sarcastically. \"And how do  you propose to get to California?\"    \"I can go either by steamer, across the isthmus, or over the Union  Pacific road.\"    \"That isn't what I mean. Where are you to get the money to pay your fare  with?\"    \"I suppose you will supply that,\" said Eben.    \"You do? Well, it strikes me you have some assurance,\" ejaculated Mr.  Graham. \"You expect me to advance hundreds of dollars, made by working  early and late, to support a spendthrift son!\"    \"I'll pay you back as soon as I am able,\" said Eben, a little abashed.    \"No doubt! You'd pay me in the same way you pay your board bills,\" said  Ebenezer, who may be excused for the sneer. \"I can invest my money to  better advantage than upon you.\"    \"Then, if you will not do that,\" said Eben, sullenly, \"I will leave you  to suggest a plan.\"    \"There is only one plan I can think of, Eben. Go back to your old place  in the store. I will dismiss the Carr boy, and you can attend to the  post office, and do the store work.\"    \"What, go back to tending a country grocery, after being a salesman in a  city store!\" exclaimed Eben, disdainfully.    \"Yes, it seems the only thing you have left. It's your own fault that  you are not still a salesman in the city.\"    Eben took the cigar from his mouth, and thought rapidly.    \"Well,\" he said, after a pause, \"if I agree to do this, what will you  pay me?\"    \"What will I pay you?\"    \"Yes, will you pay me ten dollars a week--the same as I got at Hanbury &  Deane's?\"    \"Ten dollars a week!\" ejaculated Ebenezer, \"I don't get any more than  that myself.\"    \"I guess there's a little mistake in your calculations, father,\" said  Eben, significantly. \"If you don't make at least forty dollars a week,  including the post office, then I am mistaken.\"    \"So you are--ridiculously mistaken!\" said his father, sharply. \"What  you presume is entirely out of the question. You forget that you will  be getting your board, and Tom Tripp only received a dollar and a half a  week without board.\"    \"Is that all you pay to Herbert Carr?\"    \"I pay him a leetle more,\" admitted Ebenezer.    \"What will you give me?\"    \"I'll give you your board and clothes,\" said Ebenezer, \"and that seems  to be more than you made in Boston.\"    \"Are you in earnest?\" asked Eben, in genuine dismay.    \"Certainly. It isn't a bad offer, either.\"    \"Do you suppose a young man like me can get along without money?\"    \"You ought to get along without money for the next two years, after the  sums you've wasted in Boston. It will cripple me to pay your bills,\" and  the storekeeper groaned at the thought of the inroads the payment would  make on his bank account.    \"You're poorer than I thought, if seventy-five dollars will cripple  you,\" said Eben, who knew his father's circumstances too well to be  moved by this representation.    \"I shall be in the poorhouse before many years if I undertake to pay all  your bills, Eben.\"    After all, this was not, perhaps, an exaggeration, for a spendthrift son  can get through a great deal of money.    \"I can't get along without money, father,\" said Eben, decidedly. \"How  can I buy cigars, let alone other things?\"    \"I don't want you to smoke cigars. You'll be a great deal better off  without them,\" said his father, sharply.    \"I understand; it's necessary to my health,\" said Eben, rather absurdly.    \"You won't smoke at my expense,\" said Ebenezer, decidedly. \"I don't  smoke myself, and I never knew any good come of it.\"    \"All the same, I must have some money. What will people say about a  young man of my age not having a cent in his pocket? They think my  father is very mean.\"    \"I'll allow you fifty cents a week,\" said Mr. Graham, after a pause.    \"That won't do! You seem to think I am only six or seven years old!\"    Finally, after considerable haggling, Mr. Graham agreed to pay his son  a dollar and a half a week, in cash, besides board and clothes. He  reflected that he should be obliged to board and clothe his son at any  rate, and should save a dollar and a half from Herbert's wages.    \"Well,\" he said, \"when will you be ready to go to work?\"    \"I must have a few days to loaf, father. I have been hard at work for a  long time, and need some rest.\"    \"Then you can begin next Monday morning. I'll get Herbert to show you  how to prepare"]]]
