Still, it was  something of a relief that the other had not opened the conversation  with an indictment of Drummond.    \"You see,\" he said apologetically, \"I'm in for the Gotford.\"    \"So am _I_. What's the good of swotting, though? I'm not going to  do a stroke.\"    As Stanning was the only one of his rivals of whom he had any real  fear, Sheen might have replied with justice that, if that was the case,  the more he swotted the better. But he said nothing. He looked at the  stove, and dog's-eared the Thucydides.    \"What a worm you are, always staying in!\" said Stanning.    \"I caught a cold watching the match yesterday.\"    \"You're as flabby as--\" Stanning looked round for a simile, \"as a  dough-nut. Why don't you take some exercise?\"    \"I'm going to play fives, I think. I do need some exercise.\"    \"Fives? Why don't you play footer?\"    \"I haven't time. I want to work.\"    \"What rot. I'm not doing a stroke.\"    Stanning seemed to derive a spiritual pride from this admission.    \"Tell you what, then,\" said Stanning, \"I'll play you tomorrow after  school.\"    Sheen looked a shade more uncomfortable, but he made an effort, and  declined the invitation.    \"I shall probably be playing Drummond,\" he said.    \"Oh, all right,\" said Stanning. \"_I_ don't care. Play whom you  like.\"    There was a pause.    \"As a matter of fact,\" resumed Stanning, \"what I came here for was to  tell you about last night. I got out, and went to Mitchell's. Why  didn't you come? Didn't you get my note? I sent a kid with it.\"    Mitchell was a young gentleman of rich but honest parents, who had left  the school at Christmas. He was in his father's office, and lived in  his father's house on the outskirts of the town. From time to time his  father went up to London on matters connected with business, leaving  him alone in the house. On these occasions Mitchell the younger would  write to Stanning, with whom when at school he had been on friendly  terms; and Stanning, breaking out of his house after everybody had gone  to bed, would make his way to the Mitchell residence, and spend a  pleasant hour or so there. Mitchell senior owned Turkish cigarettes and  a billiard table. Stanning appreciated both. There was also a piano,  and Stanning had brought Sheen with him one night to play it. The  getting-out and the subsequent getting-in had nearly whitened Sheen's  hair, and it was only by a series of miracles that he had escaped  detection. Once, he felt, was more than enough; and when a fag from  Appleby's had brought him Stanning's note, containing an invitation to  a second jaunt of the kind, he had refused to be lured into the  business again.    \"Yes, I got the note,\" he said.    \"Then why didn't you come? Mitchell was asking where you were.\"    \"It's so beastly risky.\"    \"Risky! Rot.\"    \"We should get sacked if we were caught.\"    \"Well, don't get caught, then.\"    Sheen registered an internal vow that he would not.    \"He wanted us to go again on Monday. Will you come?\"    \"I--don't think I will, Stanning,\" said Sheen. \"It isn't worth it.\"    \"You mean you funk it. That's what's the matter with you.\"    \"Yes, I do,\" admitted Sheen.    As a rule--in stories--the person who owns that he is afraid gets  unlimited applause and adulation, and feels a glow of conscious merit.  But with Sheen it was otherwise. The admission made him if possible,  more uncomfortable than he had been before.    \"Mitchell will be sick,\" said Stanning.    Sheen said nothing.    Stanning changed the subject.    \"Well, at anyrate,\" he said, \"give us some tea. You seem to have been  victualling for a siege.\"    \"I'm awfully sorry,\" said Sheen, turning a deeper shade of red and  experiencing a redoubled attack of the warm shooting, \"but the fact is,  I'm waiting for Drummond.\"    Stanning got up, and expressed his candid opinion of Drummond in a few  words.    He said more. He described Sheen, too in unflattering terms.    \"Look here,\" he said, \"you may think it jolly fine to drop me just  because you've got to know Drummond a bit, but you'll be sick enough  that you've done it before you've finished.\"    \"It isn't that--\" began Sheen.    \"I don't care what it is. You slink about trying to avoid me all day,  and you won't do a thing I ask you to do.\"    \"But you see--\"    \"Oh, shut up,\" said Stanning.          III    SHEEN RECEIVES VISITORS AND ADVICE      While Sheen had been interviewing Stanning, in study twelve, farther  down the passage, Linton and his friend Dunstable, who was in Day's  house, were discussing ways and means. Like Stanning, Dunstable had  demanded tea, and had been informed that there was none for him.    \"Well, you are a bright specimen, aren't you?\" said Dunstable, seating  himself on the table which should have been groaning under the weight  of cake and biscuits. \"I should like to know where you expect to go to.  You lure me in here, and then have the cheek to tell me you haven't got  anything to eat. What have you done with it all?\"    \"There was half a cake--\"    \"Bring it on.\"    \"Young Menzies bagged it after the match yesterday. His brother came  down with the Oxford A team, and he had to give him tea in his study.  Then there were some biscuits--\"    \"What's the matter with biscuits? _They're_ all right. Bring them  on. Biscuits forward. Show biscuits.\"    \"Menzies took them as well.\"    Dunstable eyed him sorrowfully.    \"You always were a bit of a maniac,\" he said, \"but I never thought you  were quite such a complete gibberer as to let Menzies get away with all  your grub. Well, the only thing to do is to touch him for tea. He owes  us one. Come on.\"    They proceeded down the passage and stopped at the door of study three.    \"Hullo!\" said Menzies, as they entered.    \"We've come to tea,\" said Dunstable. \"Cut the satisfying sandwich. Let's  see a little more of that hissing urn of yours, Menzies. Bustle about,  and be the dashing host.\"    \"I wasn't expecting you.\"    \"I can't help your troubles,\" said Dunstable.    \"I've not got anything. I was thinking of coming to you, Linton.\"    \"Where's that cake?\"    \"Finished. My brother simply walked into it.\"    \"Greed,\" said Dunstable unkindly, \"seems to be the besetting sin of the  Menzies'. Well, what are you going to do about it? I don't wish to  threaten, but I'm a demon when I'm roused. Being done out of my tea is  sure to rouse me. And owing to unfortunate accident of being stonily  broken, I can't go to the shop. You're responsible for the slump in  provisions, Menzies, and you must see us through this. What are you  going to do about it?\"    \"Do either of you chaps know Sheen at all?\"    \"I don't,\" said Linton. \"Not to speak to.\"    \"You can't expect us to know all your shady friends,\" said Dunstable.  \"Why?\"    \"He's got a tea on this evening. If you knew him well enough, you might  borrow something from him. I met Herbert in the dinner-hour carrying in  all sorts of things to his study. Still, if you don't know him--\"    \"Don't let a trifle of that sort stand in the way,\" said Dunstable.  \"Which is his study?\"    \"Come on, Linton,\" said Dunstable. \"Be a man, and lead the way. Go in  as if he'd invited us. Ten to one he'll think he did, if you don't  spoil the thing by laughing.\"    \"What, invite ourselves to tea?\" asked Linton, beginning to grasp the  idea.    \"That's it. Sheen's the sort of ass who won't do a thing. Anyhow, its  worth trying. Smith in our house got a tea out of him that way last  term. Coming, Menzies?\"    \"Not much. I hope he kicks you out.\"    \"Come on, then, Linton. If Menzies cares to chuck away a square meal,  let him.\"    Thus, no sooner had the door of Sheen's study closed upon Stanning than  it was opened again to admit Linton and Dunstable.    \"Well,\" said Linton, affably, \"here we are.\"    \"Hope we're not late,\" said Dunstable. \"You said somewhere about five.  It's just struck. Shall we start?\"    He stooped, and took the kettle from the stove.    \"Don't you bother,\" he said to Sheen, who had watched this manoeuvre  with an air of amazement, \"I'll do all the dirty work.\"    \"But--\" began Sheen.    \"That's all right,\" said Dunstable soothingly. \"I like it.\"    The intellectual pressure of the affair was too much for Sheen. He  could not recollect having invited Linton, with whom he had exchanged  only about a dozen words that term, much less Dunstable, whom he merely  knew by sight. Yet here they were, behaving like honoured guests. It  was plain that there was a misunderstanding somewhere, but he shrank  from grappling with it. He did not want to hurt their feelings. It  would be awkward enough if they discovered their mistake for  themselves.    So he exerted himself nervously to play the host, and the first twinge  of remorse which Linton felt came when Sheen pressed upon him a bag of  biscuits which, he knew, could not have cost less than one and sixpence  a pound. His heart warmed to one who could do the thing in such style.    Dunstable, apparently, was worried by no scruples. He leaned back  easily in his chair, and kept up a bright flow of conversation.    \"You're not looking well, Sheen,\" he said. \"You ought to take more  exercise. Why don't you come down town with us one of these days and do  a bit of canvassing? It's a rag. Linton lost a tooth at it the other  day. We're going down on Saturday to do a bit more.\"    \"Oh!\" said Sheen, politely.    \"We shall get one or two more chaps to help next time. It isn't good  enough, only us two. We had four great beefy hooligans on to us when  Linton got his tooth knocked out. We had to run. There's a regular gang  of them going about the town, now that the election's on.

He made Andrea a money offer  and to court he went.    He took a pupil with him, but he left his wife at home. At the court  of Francis I. he was received with great honours, and amid those new  and gracious surroundings, away from the tantalising charms of his  wife and her shrewish tongue, he began to have an honest ambition to  do great things. His work for France was undertaken with enthusiasm,  but no sooner was he settled and at peace, than the irrepressible wife  began to torment him with letters to return. Each letter distracted  him more and more, till he told the King in his despair, that he must  return home, but that he would come back to France and continue his  work, almost at once. Francis I., little suspecting the cause of  Andrea's uneasiness, gave him permission to go, and also a large sum  of money to spend upon certain fine works of art which he was to bring  back to France.    We can well believe that Andrea started back to his home with every  good intention; that he meant to appease his wife and also his own  longing to see her; to buy the King his pictures with the money  entrusted to him, and to return to France and finish his work; but,  alas, he no sooner got back to his wife than his virtuous purpose  fled. She wanted this; she wanted that--and especially she wanted a  fine house which could just about be built for the sum of money which  the King of France had entrusted to Andrea.    Andrea is a pitiable figure, but he was also a vagabond, if we are to  believe Vasari. He took the King's money, built his wretched wife a  mansion, and never again dared return to France, where his dishonesty  made him forever despised.    Afterward he was overwhelmed with despair for what he had done, and he  tried to make his peace with Francis; but while that monarch did not  punish him directly for his knavery; he would have no more to do with  him, and this was the worst punishment the artist could have  had. However, his genius was so great that other than French people  forgot his dishonesty and he began life anew in his native place.    Almost all his pictures were on sacred subjects; and finally, when  driven from Florence to Luco by the plague, taking with him his wife  and stepdaughter, he began a picture called the \"Madonna del Sacco\"  (the Madonna of the Sack).    This fresco was to adorn the convent of the Servi, and the sketches  for it were probably made in Luco. When the plague passed and the  artist was able to return to Florence, he began to paint it upon the  cloister walls.    Andrea, like Leonardo, painted a famous \"Last Supper,\" although the  two pictures cannot be compared. In Andrea's picture it is said that  all the faces are portraits.    Just before the plague sent him and his family from Florence a most  remarkable incident took place. Raphael had painted a celebrated  portrait of Pope Leo X. in a group, and the picture belonged to  Ottaviano de Medici. Duke Frederick II., of Mantua, longed to own this  picture, and at last requested the Medici to give it to him. The Duke  could not well be refused, but Ottaviano wanted to keep so great a  work for himself. What was to be done? He was in great trouble over  the affair. The situation seemed hopeless. It seemed certain that he  must part with his beloved picture to the Duke of Mantua; but one day  Andrea del Sarto declared that he could make a copy of it that even  Raphael himself could not tell from his original. Ottaviano could  scarcely believe this, but he begged Andrea to set about it, hoping  that it might be true.    Going at the work in good earnest, Andrea painted a copy so exact that  the pupil of Raphael, who had more or less to do with the original  picture, could not tell which was which when he was asked to  choose. This pupil, Giulio Romano, was so familiar with every stroke  of Raphael's that if he were deceived surely any one might be; so the  replica was given to the Duke of Mantua, who never found out the  difference.    Years afterward Giulio Romano showed the picture to Vasari, believing  it to be the original Raphael, neither Andrea nor the Medici having  told Romano the truth. But Vasari, who knew the whole story, declared  to Romano that what he showed him was but a copy. Romano would not  believe it, but Vasari told him that he would find upon the canvas a  certain mark, known to be Andrea's. Romano looked, and behold, the  original Raphael became a del Sarto! The original picture hangs in the  Pitti Palace, while the copy made by Andrea is in the Naples Gallery.    The introduction of Andrea to Vasari was one of the few gracious  things, that Michael Angelo ever did. About Andrea he said to Raphael  at the time: \"There is a little fellow in Florence who will bring  sweat to your brows if ever he is engaged in great works.\" Raphael,  would certainly have agreed, with him had he known what was to happen  in regard to the Leo X. picture.    Notwithstanding Andrea's unfortunate temperament, which caused him to  be guided mostly by circumstances instead of guiding them, he was said  to be improving all the time in his art. He had a great many pupils,  but none of them could tolerate his wife for long, so they were always  changing.    Throughout his life the artist longed for tenderness and encouragement  from his wife, and finally, without ever receiving it, he died in a  desolate way, untended even by her. After the siege of Florence there  came a pestilence, and Andrea was overtaken by it. His wife, afraid  that she too would become ill, would have nothing to do with him. She  kept away and he died quite alone, few caring that he was dead and no  one taking the trouble to follow him to his grave. Thus one of the  greatest of Florentine painters lived and died. Years after his death,  the artist Jacopo da Empoli, was copying Andrea's \"Birth of the  Virgin\" when an old woman of about eighty years on her way to mass  stopped to speak with him. She pointed to the beautiful Virgin's face  in the picture and said: \"I am that woman.\" And so she was--the widow  of the great Andrea. Though she had treated him so cruelly, she was  glad to have it known that she was the widow of the dead genius.      PLATE--THE MADONNA DEL SACCO    _(Madonna of the Sack)_    This picture is a fresco in the cloister of the Annunziata at  Florence, and it is called \"of the sack\" because Joseph is posed  leaning against a sack, a book open upon his knees.    Doubtless the model for this Madonna is Andrea del Sarto's abominable  wife, but she looks very sweet and simple in the picture. The folds of  Mary's garments are beautifully painted, so is the poise of her head,  and all the details of the picture except the figure of the  child. There is a line of stiffness there and it lacks the softness of  many other pictures of the Infant Jesus.      PLATE--THE HOLY FAMILY    In this picture in the Pitti Palace, Florence, Andrea del Sarto  represents all the characters in a serious mood. There are St. John  and Elizabeth, Mary and the Infant Jesus, and there is no touch of  playfulness such as may be found in similar groups by other artists of  the time. Attention is concentrated upon Jesus who seems to be  learning from his young cousin. The left hand, resting upon Mary's arm  is badly drawn and in character does not seem to belong to the figure  of the child. A full, overhanging upper lip is a dominant feature in  each face.    Other works of Andrea del Sarto are \"Charity,\" which is in the Louvre;  \"Madonna dell' Arpie,\" \"A Head of Christ,\" \"The Dead Christ,\" \"Four  Saints,\" \"Joseph in Egypt,\" his own portrait, and \"Joseph's Dream.\"            II    MICHAEL ANGELO (BUONARROTI)        (Pronounced Meek-el-ahn-jel-o (Bwone-ar-ro'tee))    _Florentine School_    1475-1564    _Pupil of Ghirlandajo_    This wonderful man did more kinds of things, at a time when almost all  artists were versatile, than any other but one. Probably Leonardo da  Vinci was gifted in as many different ways as Michael Angelo, and in  his own lines was as powerful. This Florentine's life was as tragic as  it was restless.    There is a tablet in a room of a castle which stands high upon a rocky  mount, near the village of Caprese, which tells that Michael Angelo  was born in that place. The great castle is now in ruins, and more  than four hundred years of fame have passed since the little child was  born therein.    The unhappy existence of the artist seems to have been foreshadowed by  an accident which happened to his mother before he was born. She was  on horseback, riding with her husband to his official post at Chiusi,  for he was governor of Chiusi and Caprese. Her horse stumbled, fell,  and badly hurt her. This was two months before Michael Angelo was  born, and misfortune ever pursued him.    The father of Angelo was descended from an aristocratic house--the  Counts of Canossa were his ancestors--and in that day the profession  of an artist was not thought to be dignified. Hence the father had  quite different plans for the boy; but the son persisted and at last  had his way. When he was still a little child his father finished his  work as an official at Caprese and returned to Florence; but he left  the little Angelo behind with his nurse. That nurse was the wife of a  stonemason, and almost as soon as the boy could toddle he used to  wander about the quarries where the stonecutters worked, and doubtless  the baby joy of Angelo was to play at chiseling as it is the pleasure  of modern babies to play at peg-top. After a time he was sent for to  go to Florence to begin his education.    In Florence he fell in with a young chap who, like himself, loved art,  but who was fortunate enough already to be apprenticed to the great  painter of his time--Ghirlandajo. One happy day this young Granacci  volunteered to take Michael Angelo to his master's studio, and there  Angelo made such an impression on "]]]
