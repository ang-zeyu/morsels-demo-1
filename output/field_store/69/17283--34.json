[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4357"],[0,"American Fairy Tales (#3)"],[1," is one drop of liquid in it,\" was the wizard's reply.    \"Will one drop cure my rheumatism?\" inquired the glass-blower, in  wonder.    \"Most certainly. That is a marvelous remedy. The one drop contained  in the vial will cure instantly any kind of disease ever known to  humanity. Therefore it is especially good for rheumatism. But guard  it well, for it is the only drop of its kind in the world, and I've  forgotten the recipe.\"    \"Thank you,\" said the glass-blower, and went back to his room.    Then the wizard cast a wizzy spell and mumbled several very learned  words in the wizardese language over the glass dog. Whereupon the  little animal first wagged its tail from side to side, then winked  his left eye knowingly, and at last began barking in a most  frightful manner--that is, when you stop to consider the noise came  from a pink glass dog. There is something almost astonishing in the  magic arts of wizards; unless, of course, you know how to do the  things yourself, when you are not expected to be surprised at them.    The wizard was as delighted as a school teacher at the success of  his spell, although he was not astonished. Immediately he placed the  dog outside his door, where it would bark at anyone who dared knock  and so disturb the studies of its master.    The glass-blower, on returning to his room, decided not to use the  one drop of wizard cure-all just then.    \"My rheumatism is better to-day,\" he reflected, \"and I will be wise  to save the medicine for a time when I am very ill, when it will be  of more service to me.\"    So he placed the vial in his cupboard and went to work blowing more  roses out of glass. Presently he happened to think the medicine  might not keep, so he started to ask the wizard about it. But when  he reached the door the glass dog barked so fiercely that he dared  not knock, and returned in great haste to his own room. Indeed, the  poor man was quite upset at so unfriendly a reception from the dog  he had himself so carefully and skillfully made.    The next morning, as he read his newspaper, he noticed an article  stating that the beautiful Miss Mydas, the richest young lady in  town, was very ill, and the doctors had given up hope of her  recovery.    The glass-blower, although miserably poor, hard-working and homely  of feature, was a man of ideas. He suddenly recollected his precious  medicine, and determined to use it to better advantage than  relieving his own ills. He dressed himself in his best clothes,  brushed his hair and combed his whiskers, washed his hands and tied  his necktie, blackened his hoes and sponged his vest, and then put  the vial of magic cure-all in his pocket. Next he locked his door,  went downstairs and walked through the streets to the grand mansion  where the wealthy Miss Mydas resided.    The butler opened the door and said:    \"No soap, no chromos, no vegetables, no hair oil, no books, no  baking powder. My young lady is dying and we're well supplied for  the funeral.\"    The glass-blower was grieved at being taken for a peddler.    \"My friend,\" he began, proudly; but the butler interrupted him,  saying:    \"No tombstones, either; there's a family graveyard and the  monument's built.\"    \"The graveyard won't be needed if you will permit me to speak,\" said  the glass-blower.    \"No doctors, sir; they've given up my young lady, and she's given up  the doctors,\" continued the butler, calmly.    \"I'm no doctor,\" returned the glass-blower.    \"Nor are the others. But what is your errand?\"    \"I called to cure your young lady by means of a magical compound.\"    \"Step in, please, and take a seat in the hall. I'll speak to the  housekeeper,\" said the butler, more politely.    So he spoke to the housekeeper and the housekeeper mentioned the  matter to the steward and the steward consulted the chef and the  chef kissed the lady's maid and sent her to see the stranger. Thus  are the very wealthy hedged around with ceremony, even when dying.    When the lady's maid heard from the glass-blower that he had a  medicine which would cure her mistress, she said:    \"I'm glad you came.\"    \"But,\" said he, \"if I restore your mistress to health she must marry  me.\"    \"I'll make inquiries and see if she's willing,\" answered the maid,  and went at once to consult Miss Mydas.    The young lady did not hesitate an instant.    \"I'd marry any old thing rather than die!\" she cried. \"Bring him  here at once!\"    So the glass-blower came, poured the magic drop into a little water,  gave it to the patient, and the next minute Miss Mydas was as well  as she had ever been in her life.    \"Dear me!\" she exclaimed; \"I've an engagement at the Fritters'  reception to-night. Bring my pearl-colored silk, Marie, and I will  begin my toilet at once. And don't forget to cancel the order for  the funeral flowers and your mourning gown.\"    \"But, Miss Mydas,\" remonstrated the glass-blower, who stood by, \"you  promised to marry me if I cured you.\"    \"I know,\" said the young lady, \"but we must have time to make proper  announcement in the society papers and have the wedding cards  engraved. Call to-morrow and we'll talk it over.\"    The glass-blower had not impressed her favorably as a husband, and  she was glad to find an excuse for getting rid of him for a time.  And she did not want to miss the Fritters' reception.    Yet the man went home filled with joy; for he thought his stratagem  had succeeded and he was about to marry a rich wife who would keep  him in luxury forever afterward.    The first thing he did on reaching his room was to smash his  glass-blowing tools and throw them out of the window.    He then sat down to figure out ways of spending his wife's money.    The following day he called upon Miss Mydas, who was reading a novel  and eating chocolate creams as happily as if she had never been ill  in her life.    \"Where did you get the magic compound that cured me?\" she asked.    \"From a learned wizard,\" said he; and then, thinking it would  interest her, he told how he had made the glass dog for the wizard,  and how it barked and kept everybody from bothering him.    \"How delightful!\" she said. \"I've always wanted a glass dog that  could bark.\"    \"But there is only one in the world,\" he answered, \"and it belongs  to the wizard.\"    \"You must buy it for me,\" said the lady.    \"The wizard cares nothing for money,\" replied the glass-blower.    \"Then you must steal it for me,\" she retorted. \"I can never live  happily another day unless I have a glass dog that can bark.\"    The glass-blower was much distressed at this, but said he would see  what he could do. For a man should always try to please his wife,  and Miss Mydas has promised to marry him within a week.    On his way home he purchased a heavy sack, and when he passed the  wizard's door and the pink glass dog ran out to bark at him he threw  the sack over the dog, tied the opening with a piece of twine, and  carried him away to his own room.    The next day he sent the sack by a messenger boy to Miss Mydas, with  his compliments, and later in the afternoon he called upon her in  person, feeling quite sure he would be received with gratitude for  stealing the dog she so greatly desired.    But when he came to the door and the butler opened it, what was his  amazement to see the glass dog rush out and begin barking at him  furiously.    \"Call off your dog,\" he shouted, in terror.    \"I can't, sir,\" answered the butler. \"My young lady has ordered the  glass dog to bark whenever you call here. You'd better look out,  sir,\" he added, \"for if it bites you, you may have glassophobia!\"    This so frightened the poor glass-blower that he went away  hurriedly. But he stopped at a drug store and put his last dime in  the telephone box so he could talk to Miss Mydas without being  bitten by the dog.    \"Give me Pelf 6742!\" he called.    \"Hello! What is it?\" said a voice.    \"I want to speak with Miss Mydas,\" said the glass-blower.    Presently a sweet voice said: \"This is Miss Mydas. What is it?\"    \"Why have you treated me so cruelly and set the glass dog on me?\"  asked the poor fellow.    \"Well, to tell the truth,\" said the lady, \"I don't like your looks.  Your cheeks are pale and baggy, your hair is coarse and long, your  eyes are small and red, your hands are big and rough, and you are  bow-legged.\"    \"But I can't help my looks!\" pleaded the glass-blower; \"and you  really promised to marry me.\"    \"If you were better looking I'd keep my promise,\" she returned. \"But  under the circumstances you are no fit mate for me, and unless you  keep away from my mansion I shall set my glass dog on you!\" Then she  dropped the 'phone and would have nothing more to say.    The miserable glass-blower went home with a heart bursting with  disappointment and began tying a rope to the bedpost by which to  hang himself.    Some one knocked at the door, and, upon opening it, he saw the  wizard.    \"I've lost my dog,\" he announced.    \"Have you, indeed?\" replied the glass-blower tying a knot in the  rope.    \"Yes; some one has stolen him.\"    \"That's too bad,\" declared the glass-blower, indifferently.    \"You must make me another,\" said the wizard.    \"But I cannot; I've thrown away my tools.\"    \"Then what shall I do?\" asked the wizard.    \"I do not know, unless you offer a reward for the dog.\"    \"But I have no money,\" said the wizard.    \"Offer some of your compounds, then,\" suggested the glass-blower,  who was making a noose in the rope for his head to go through.    \"The only thing I can spare,\" replied the wizard, thoughtfully, \"is  a Beauty Powder.\"    \"What!\" cried the glass-blower, throwing down the rope, \"have you  really such a thing?\"    \"Yes, indeed. Whoever takes the powder will become the most  beautiful person in the world.\"    \"If you will offer that as a reward,\" said the glass-blower,  eagerly, \"I'll try to find the dog for you, for above everything  else I long to be beautiful.\"    \"But I warn you the beauty will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4358"],[0,"The Sea Fairies (#3)"],[1," brown-haired one smilingly, \"and we wanted to prove to  him that they were wrong.\"    \"I on'y said what I've heard,\" protested Cap'n Bill. \"Never havin'  seen a mermaid afore, I couldn't be ackerate, an' I never expected  to see one an' live to tell the tale.\"    Again the cave rang with merry laughter, and as it died away, Trot  said, \"May I see your scales, please? And are they green and purple  and pink like Cap'n Bill said?\" They seemed undecided what to say to  this and swam a little way off, where the beautiful heads formed a  group that was delightful to see. Perhaps they talked together, for  the brown-haired mermaid soon came back to the side of the boat and  asked, \"Would you like to visit our kingdom and see all the wonders  that exist below the sea?\"    \"I'd like to,\" replied Trot promptly, \"but I couldn't. I'd get  drowned.\"    \"That you would, mate!\" cried Cap'n Bill.    \"Oh no,\" said the mermaid. \"We would make you both like one of  ourselves, and then you could live within the water as easily as we  do.\"    \"I don't know as I'd like that,\" said the child, \"at least for  always.\"    \"You need not stay with us a moment longer than you please,\"  returned the mermaid, smiling as if amused at the remark. \"Whenever  you are ready to return home, we promise to bring you to this place  again and restore to you the same forms you are now wearing.\"    \"Would I have a fish's tail?\" asked Trot earnestly.    \"You would have a mermaid's tail,\" was the reply.    \"What color would my scales be--pink, or purple?\"    \"You may choose the color yourself.\"    \"Look ahere, Trot!\" said Cap'n Bill in excitement. \"You ain't  thinkin' o' doin' such a fool thing, are you?\"    \"'Course I am,\" declared the little girl. \"We don't get such  inv'tations every day, Cap'n, and if I don't go now I may never find  out how the mermaids live.\"    \"I don't care how they live, myself,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I jes' want  'em to let ME live.\"    \"There's no danger,\" insisted Trot.    \"I do' know 'bout that. That's what all the other folks said when  they dove after the mermaids an' got drownded.\"    \"Who?\" asked the girl.    \"I don't know who, but I've heard tell--\"    \"You've heard that no one ever saw a mermaid and lived,\" said Trot.    \"To tell the tale,\" he added, nodding. \"An' if we dives down like  they says, we won't live ourselves.\"    All the mermaids laughed at this, and the brown-haired one said,  \"Well, if you are afraid, don't come. You may row your boat out of  this cave and never see us again, if you like. We merely thought it  would please little Mayre, and were willing to show her the sights  of our beautiful home.\"    \"I'd like to see 'em, all right,\" said Trot, her eyes glistening  with pleasure.    \"So would I,\" admitted Cap'n Bill, \"if we would live to tell the  tale.\"    \"Don't you believe us?\" asked the mermaid, fixing her lovely eyes on  those of the old sailor and smiling prettily. \"Are you afraid to  trust us to bring you safely back?\"    \"N-n-no,\" said Cap'n Bill, \"'tain't that. I've got to look after  Trot.\"    \"Then you'll have to come with me,\" said Trot decidedly, \"for I'm  going to 'cept this inv'tation. If you don't care to come, Cap'n  Bill, you go home and tell mother I'm visitin' the mermaids.\"    \"She'd scold me inter shivers!\" moaned Cap'n Bill with a shudder. \"I  guess I'd ruther take my chance down below.\"    \"All right, I'm ready, Miss Mermaid,\" said Trot. \"What shall I do?  Jump in, clothes and all?\"    \"Give me your hand, dear,\" answered the mermaid, lifting a lovely  white arm from the water. Trot took the slender hand and found it  warm and soft and not a bit \"fishy.\"    \"My name is Clia,\" continued the mermaid, \"and I am a princess in  our deep-sea kingdom.\"    Just then Trot gave a flop and flopped right out of the boat into  the water. Cap'n Bill caught a gleam of pink scales as his little  friend went overboard, and the next moment there was Trot's face in  the water among those of the mermaids. She was laughing with glee as  she looked up into Cap'n Bill's face and called, \"Come on in, Cap'n!  It didn't hurt a bit!\"          CHAPTER 3    THE DEPTHS OF THE DEEP BLUE SEA      Cap'n Bill stood up in the boat as if undecided what to do. Never a  sailor man was more bewildered than this old fellow by the  strangeness of the adventure he had encountered. At first he could  hardly believe it was all true and that he was not dreaming; but  there was Trot in the water, laughing with the mermaids and floating  comfortably about, and he couldn't leave his dear little companion  to make the trip to the depths of the ocean alone.    \"Take my hand, please, Cap'n Bill,\" said Princess Clia, reaching her  dainty arm toward him; and suddenly the old man took courage and  clasped the soft fingers in his own. He had to lean over the boat to  do this, and then there came a queer lightness to his legs and he  had a great longing to be in the water. So he gave a flop and  flopped in beside Trot, where he found himself comfortable enough,  but somewhat frightened.    \"Law sakes!\" he gasped. \"Here's me in the water with my rheumatics!  I'll be that stiff termorrer I can't wiggle.\"    \"You're wigglin' all right now,\" observed Trot. \"That's a fine tail  you've got, Cap'n, an' its green scales is jus' beautiful.\"    \"Are they green, eh?\" he asked, twisting around to try to see them.    \"Green as em'ralds, Cap'n. How do they feel?\"    \"Feel, Trot, feel? Why, this tail beats that ol' wooden leg all  holler! I kin do stunts now that I couldn't o' done in a thousand  years with ol' peg.\"    \"And don't be afraid of the rheumatism,\" advised the Princess. \"No  mermaid ever catches cold or suffers pain in the water.\"    \"Is Cap'n Bill a mermaid now?\" asked Trot.    \"Why, he's a merMAN, I suppose,\" laughed the pretty princess. \"But  when he gets home, he will be just Cap'n Bill again.\"    \"Wooden leg an' all?\" inquired the child.    \"To be sure, my dear.\"    The sailor was now trying his newly discovered power of swimming,  and became astonished at the feats he could accomplish. He could  dart this way and that with wonderful speed, and turn and dive, and  caper about in the water far better than he had ever been able to do  on land--even before he got the wooden leg. And a curious thing  about this present experience was that the water did not cling to  him and wet him as it had always done before. He still wore his  flannel shirt and pea jacket and his sailor cap; but although he was  in the water and had been underneath the surface, the cloth still  seemed dry and warm. As he dived down and came up again, the drops  flashed from his head and the fringe of beard, but he never needed  to wipe his face or eyes at all.    Trot, too, was having queer experiences and enjoying them. When she  ducked under water, she saw plainly everything about her as easily  and distinctly as she had ever seen anything above water. And by  looking over her shoulder she could watch the motion of her new  tail, all covered with pretty iridescent pink scales, which gleamed  like jewels. She wore her dress the same as before, and the water  failed to affect it in the least.    She now noticed that the mermaids were clothed, too, and their  exquisite gowns were the loveliest thing the little girl had ever  beheld. They seemed made of a material that was like sheeny silk,  cut low in the neck and with wide, flowing sleeves that seldom  covered the shapely, white arms of her new friends. The gowns had  trains that floated far behind the mermaids as they swam, but were  so fleecy and transparent that the sparkle of their scales might be  seen reaching back of their waists, where the human form ended and  the fish part began. The sea fairies wore strings of splendid pearls  twined around their throats, while more pearls were sewn upon their  gowns for trimmings. They did not dress their beautiful hair at all,  but let it float around them in clouds.    The little girl had scarcely time to observe all this when the  princess said, \"Now, my dear, if you are ready, we will begin our  journey, for it is a long way to our palaces.\"    \"All right,\" answered Trot, and took the hand extended to her with a  trustful smile.    \"Will you allow me to guide you, Cap'n Bill?\" asked the blonde  mermaid, extending her hand to the old sailor.    \"Of course, ma'am,\" he said, taking her fingers rather bashfully.    \"My name is Merla,\" she continued, \"and I am cousin to Princess  Clia. We must all keep together, you know, and I will hold your hand  to prevent your missing the way.\"    While she spoke they began to descend through the water, and it grew  quite dark for a time because the cave shut out the light. But  presently Trot, who was eagerly looking around her, began to notice  the water lighten and saw they were coming into brighter parts of  the sea. \"We have left the cave now,\" said Clia, \"and may swim  straight home.\"    \"I s'pose there are no winding roads in the ocean,\" remarked the  child, swimming swiftly beside her new friend.    \"Oh yes indeed. At the bottom, the way is far from being straight or  level,\" replied Clia. \"But we are in mid-water now, where nothing  will hinder our journey, unless--\"    She seemed to hesitate, so Trot asked, \"Unless what?\"    \"Unless we meet with disagreeable creatures,\" said the Princess.  \"The mid-water is not as safe as the very bottom, and that is the  reason we are holding your hands.\"    \"What good would that do?\" asked Trot.    \"You must remember that we are fairies,\" said Princess Clia. \"For  that reason, nothing in the ocean can injure us, but you two are  mortals and therefore not entirely safe at all times unless we  protect you.\"    Trot was thoughtful for a few moments and looked around her a little  anxiously. Now and then a dark form would shoot across their pathway  or pass them at some distance, but none was near enough for the girl  to see plainly what it might be. Suddenly they swam right into a big  school "]]]
