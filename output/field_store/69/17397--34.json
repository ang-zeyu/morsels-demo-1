'Sir,' I say (for this  last question of his outrages me, and I have done being familiar with  him--) 'Sir! the immortal fire of genius burns in this Englishman's  bosom, and, what is more, his father had it before him!'  'Never mind,'  says the golden barbarian of a Papa, 'never mind about his genius, Mr.  Pesca.  We don't want genius in this country, unless it is accompanied  by respectability--and then we are very glad to have it, very glad  indeed.  Can your friend produce testimonials--letters that speak to  his character?'  I wave my hand negligently. 'Letters?' I say.  'Ha!  my-soul-bless-my-soul! I should think so, indeed! Volumes of letters  and portfolios of testimonials, if you like!' 'One or two will do,'  says this man of phlegm and money. 'Let him send them to me, with his  name and address.  And--stop, stop, Mr. Pesca--before you go to your  friend, you had better take a note.' 'Bank-note!' I say, indignantly.  'No bank-note, if you please, till my brave Englishman has earned it  first.'  'Bank-note!' says Papa, in a great surprise, 'who talked of  bank-note? I mean a note of the terms--a memorandum of what he is  expected to do.  Go on with your lesson, Mr. Pesca, and I will give you  the necessary extract from my friend's letter.' Down sits the man of  merchandise and money to his pen, ink, and paper; and down I go once  again into the Hell of Dante, with my three young Misses after me.  In  ten minutes' time the note is written, and the boots of Papa are  creaking themselves away in the passage outside.  From that moment, on  my faith, and soul, and honour, I know nothing more! The glorious  thought that I have caught my opportunity at last, and that my grateful  service for my dearest friend in the world is as good as done already,  flies up into my head and makes me drunk.  How I pull my young Misses  and myself out of our Infernal Region again, how my other business is  done afterwards, how my little bit of dinner slides itself down my  throat, I know no more than a man in the moon.  Enough for me, that  here I am, with the mighty merchant's note in my hand, as large as  life, as hot as fire, and as happy as a king! Ha! ha! ha!  right-right-right-all-right!\" Here the Professor waved the memorandum  of terms over his head, and ended his long and voluble narrative with  his shrill Italian parody on an English cheer.\"    My mother rose the moment he had done, with flushed cheeks and  brightened eyes.  She caught the little man warmly by both hands.    \"My dear, good Pesca,\" she said, \"I never doubted your true affection  for Walter--but I am more than ever persuaded of it now!\"    \"I am sure we are very much obliged to Professor Pesca, for Walter's  sake,\" added Sarah.  She half rose, while she spoke, as if to approach  the arm-chair, in her turn; but, observing that Pesca was rapturously  kissing my mother's hands, looked serious, and resumed her seat.  \"If  the familiar little man treats my mother in that way, how will he treat  ME?\" Faces sometimes tell truth; and that was unquestionably the  thought in Sarah's mind, as she sat down again.    Although I myself was gratefully sensible of the kindness of Pesca's  motives, my spirits were hardly so much elevated as they ought to have  been by the prospect of future employment now placed before me.  When  the Professor had quite done with my mother's hand, and when I had  warmly thanked him for his interference on my behalf, I asked to be  allowed to look at the note of terms which his respectable patron had  drawn up for my inspection.    Pesca handed me the paper, with a triumphant flourish of the hand.    \"Read!\" said the little man majestically.  \"I promise you my friend,  the writing of the golden Papa speaks with a tongue of trumpets for  itself.\"    The note of terms was plain, straightforward, and comprehensive, at any  rate.  It informed me,    First, That Frederick Fairlie, Esquire, of Limmeridge House.  Cumberland, wanted to engage the services of a thoroughly competent  drawing-master, for a period of four months certain.    Secondly, That the duties which the master was expected to perform  would be of a twofold kind.  He was to superintend the instruction of  two young ladies in the art of painting in water-colours; and he was to  devote his leisure time, afterwards, to the business of repairing and  mounting a valuable collection of drawings, which had been suffered to  fall into a condition of total neglect.    Thirdly, That the terms offered to the person who should undertake and  properly perform these duties were four guineas a week; that he was to  reside at Limmeridge House; and that he was to be treated there on the  footing of a gentleman.    Fourthly, and lastly, That no person need think of applying for this  situation unless he could furnish the most unexceptionable references  to character and abilities.  The references were to be sent to Mr.  Fairlie's friend in London, who was empowered to conclude all necessary  arrangements.  These instructions were followed by the name and address  of Pesca's employer in Portland Place--and there the note, or  memorandum, ended.    The prospect which this offer of an engagement held out was certainly  an attractive one.  The employment was likely to be both easy and  agreeable; it was proposed to me at the autumn time of the year when I  was least occupied; and the terms, judging by my personal experience in  my profession, were surprisingly liberal. I knew this; I knew that I  ought to consider myself very fortunate if I succeeded in securing the  offered employment--and yet, no sooner had I read the memorandum than I  felt an inexplicable unwillingness within me to stir in the matter.  I  had never in the whole of my previous experience found my duty and my  inclination so painfully and so unaccountably at variance as I found  them now.    \"Oh, Walter, your father never had such a chance as this!\" said my  mother, when she had read the note of terms and had handed it back to  me.    \"Such distinguished people to know,\" remarked Sarah, straightening  herself in the chair; \"and on such gratifying terms of equality too!\"    \"Yes, yes; the terms, in every sense, are tempting enough,\" I replied  impatiently.  \"But before I send in my testimonials, I should like a  little time to consider----\"    \"Consider!\" exclaimed my mother.  \"Why, Walter, what is the matter with  you?\"    \"Consider!\" echoed my sister.  \"What a very extraordinary thing to say,  under the circumstances!\"    \"Consider!\" chimed in the Professor.  \"What is there to consider about?  Answer me this! Have you not been complaining of your health, and have  you not been longing for what you call a smack of the country breeze?  Well! there in your hand is the paper that offers you perpetual choking  mouthfuls of country breeze for four months' time.  Is it not so? Ha!  Again--you want money.  Well! Is four golden guineas a week nothing?  My-soul-bless-my-soul! only give it to me--and my boots shall creak  like the golden Papa's, with a sense of the overpowering richness of  the man who walks in them! Four guineas a week, and, more than that,  the charming society of two young misses! and, more than that, your  bed, your breakfast, your dinner, your gorging English teas and lunches  and drinks of foaming beer, all for nothing--why, Walter, my dear good  friend--deuce-what-the-deuce!--for the first time in my life I have not  eyes enough in my head to look, and wonder at you!\"    Neither my mother's evident astonishment at my behaviour, nor Pesca's  fervid enumeration of the advantages offered to me by the new  employment, had any effect in shaking my unreasonable disinclination to  go to Limmeridge House.  After starting all the petty objections that I  could think of to going to Cumberland, and after hearing them answered,  one after another, to my own complete discomfiture, I tried to set up a  last obstacle by asking what was to become of my pupils in London while  I was teaching Mr. Fairlie's young ladies to sketch from nature.  The  obvious answer to this was, that the greater part of them would be away  on their autumn travels, and that the few who remained at home might be  confided to the care of one of my brother drawing-masters, whose pupils  I had once taken off his hands under similar circumstances. My sister  reminded me that this gentleman had expressly placed his services at my  disposal, during the present season, in case I wished to leave town; my  mother seriously appealed to me not to let an idle caprice stand in the  way of my own interests and my own health; and Pesca piteously  entreated that I would not wound him to the heart by rejecting the  first grateful offer of service that he had been able to make to the  friend who had saved his life.    The evident sincerity and affection which inspired these remonstrances  would have influenced any man with an atom of good feeling in his  composition.  Though I could not conquer my own unaccountable  perversity, I had at least virtue enough to be heartily ashamed of it,  and to end the discussion pleasantly by giving way, and promising to do  all that was wanted of me.    The rest of the evening passed merrily enough in humorous anticipations  of my coming life with the two young ladies in Cumberland.  Pesca,  inspired by our national grog, which appeared to get into his head, in  the most marvellous manner, five minutes after it had gone down his  throat, asserted his claims to be considered a complete Englishman by  making a series of speeches in rapid succession, proposing my mother's  health, my sister's health, my health, and the healths, in mass, of Mr.  Fairlie and the two young Misses, pathetically returning thanks  himself, immediately afterwards, for the whole party.  \"A secret,  Walter,\" said my little friend confidentially, as we walked home  together. \"I am flushed by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/584"],[0,"Our Nig; Or, Sketches from the Life of a Free Black, in a Two-story White House, (#3)"],[1,"is wearing the badge of  age. Most of his children were from home; some seeking employment; some  were already settled in homes of their own. A maiden sister shared with  him the estate on which he resided, and occupied a portion of the house.    Within sight of the house, Seth seated himself with his bundles and the  child he had been leading, while Mag walked onward to the house leading  Frado. A knock at the door brought Mrs. Bellmont, and Mag asked if she  would be willing to let that child stop there while she went to the  Reed's house to wash, and when she came back she would call and get her.  It seemed a novel request, but she consented. Why the impetuous child  entered the house, we cannot tell; the door closed, and Mag hastily  departed. Frado waited for the close of day, which was to bring back her  mother. Alas! it never came. It was the last time she ever saw or heard  of her mother.          CHAPTER III.    A NEW HOME FOR ME.        Oh! did we but know of the shadows so nigh,      The world would indeed be a prison of gloom;      All light would be quenched in youth's eloquent eye,      And the prayer-lisping infant would ask for the tomb.        For if Hope be a star that may lead us astray,      And \"deceiveth the heart,\" as the aged ones preach;      Yet 'twas Mercy that gave it, to beacon our way,      Though its halo illumes where it never can reach.        ELIZA COOK.        As the day closed and Mag did not appear, surmises were expressed by the  family that she never intended to return. Mr. Bellmont was a kind,  humane man, who would not grudge hospitality to the poorest wanderer,  nor fail to sympathize with any sufferer, however humble. The child's  desertion by her mother appealed to his sympathy, and he felt inclined  to succor her. To do this in opposition to Mrs. Bellmont's wishes, would  be like encountering a whirlwind charged with fire, daggers and spikes.  She was not as susceptible of fine emotions as her spouse. Mag's opinion  of her was not without foundation. She was self-willed, haughty,  undisciplined, arbitrary and severe. In common parlance, she was a  SCOLD, a thorough one. Mr. B. remained silent during the consultation  which follows, engaged in by mother, Mary and John, or Jack, as he was  familiarly called.    \"Send her to the County House,\" said Mary, in reply to the query what  should be done with her, in a tone which indicated self-importance in  the speaker. She was indeed the idol of her mother, and more nearly  resembled her in disposition and manners than the others.    Jane, an invalid daughter, the eldest of those at home, was reclining on  a sofa apparently uninterested.    \"Keep her,\" said Jack. \"She's real handsome and bright, and not very  black, either.\"    \"Yes,\" rejoined Mary; \"that's just like you, Jack. She'll be of no use  at all these three years, right under foot all the time.\"    \"Poh! Miss Mary; if she should stay, it wouldn't be two days before you  would be telling the girls about OUR nig, OUR nig!\" retorted Jack.    \"I don't want a nigger 'round ME, do you, mother?\" asked Mary.    \"I don't mind the nigger in the child. I should like a dozen better than  one,\" replied her mother. \"If I could make her do my work in a few  years, I would keep her. I have so much trouble with girls I hire, I am  almost persuaded if I have one to train up in my way from a child, I  shall be able to keep them awhile. I am tired of changing every few  months.\"    \"Where could she sleep?\" asked Mary. \"I don't want her near me.\"    \"In the L chamber,\" answered the mother.    \"How'll she get there?\" asked Jack. \"She'll be afraid to go through that  dark passage, and she can't climb the ladder safely.\"    \"She'll have to go there; it's good enough for a nigger,\" was the reply.    Jack was sent on horseback to ascertain if Mag was at her home. He  returned with the testimony of Pete Greene that they were fairly  departed, and that the child was intentionally thrust upon their family.    The imposition was not at all relished by Mrs. B., or the pert, haughty  Mary, who had just glided into her teens.    \"Show the child to bed, Jack,\" said his mother. \"You seem most pleased  with the little nigger, so you may introduce her to her room.\"    He went to the kitchen, and, taking Frado gently by the hand, told her  he would put her in bed now; perhaps her mother would come the next  night after her.    It was not yet quite dark, so they ascended the stairs without any  light, passing through nicely furnished rooms, which were a source of  great amazement to the child. He opened the door which connected with  her room by a dark, unfinished passage-way. \"Don't bump your head,\" said  Jack, and stepped before to open the door leading into her  apartment,--an unfinished chamber over the kitchen, the roof slanting  nearly to the floor, so that the bed could stand only in the middle of  the room. A small half window furnished light and air. Jack returned to  the sitting room with the remark that the child would soon outgrow those  quarters.    \"When she DOES, she'll outgrow the house,\" remarked the mother.    \"What can she do to help you?\" asked Mary. \"She came just in the right  time, didn't she? Just the very day after Bridget left,\" continued she.    \"I'll see what she can do in the morning,\" was the answer.    While this conversation was passing below, Frado lay, revolving in her  little mind whether she would remain or not until her mother's return.  She was of wilful, determined nature, a stranger to fear, and would not  hesitate to wander away should she decide to. She remembered the  conversation of her mother with Seth, the words \"given away\" which she  heard used in reference to herself; and though she did not know their  full import, she thought she should, by remaining, be in some relation  to white people she was never favored with before. So she resolved to  tarry, with the hope that mother would come and get her some time. The  hot sun had penetrated her room, and it was long before a cooling breeze  reduced the temperature so that she could sleep.    Frado was called early in the morning by her new mistress. Her first  work was to feed the hens. She was shown how it was ALWAYS to be done,  and in no other way; any departure from this rule to be punished by a  whipping. She was then accompanied by Jack to drive the cows to pasture,  so she might learn the way. Upon her return she was allowed to eat her  breakfast, consisting of a bowl of skimmed milk, with brown bread  crusts, which she was told to eat, standing, by the kitchen table, and  must not be over ten minutes about it. Meanwhile the family were taking  their morning meal in the dining-room. This over, she was placed on a  cricket to wash the common dishes; she was to be in waiting always to  bring wood and chips, to run hither and thither from room to room.    A large amount of dish-washing for small hands followed dinner. Then the  same after tea and going after the cows finished her first day's work.  It was a new discipline to the child. She found some attractions about  the place, and she retired to rest at night more willing to remain. The  same routine followed day after day, with slight variation; adding a  little more work, and spicing the toil with \"words that burn,\" and  frequent blows on her head. These were great annoyances to Frado, and  had she known where her mother was, she would have gone at once to her.  She was often greatly wearied, and silently wept over her sad fate. At  first she wept aloud, which Mrs. Bellmont noticed by applying a  raw-hide, always at hand in the kitchen. It was a symptom of discontent  and complaining which must be \"nipped in the bud,\" she said.    Thus passed a year. No intelligence of Mag. It was now certain Frado was  to become a permanent member of the family. Her labors were multiplied;  she was quite indispensable, although but seven years old. She had never  learned to read, never heard of a school until her residence in the  family.    Mrs. Bellmont was in doubt about the utility of attempting to educate  people of color, who were incapable of elevation. This subject  occasioned a lengthy discussion in the family. Mr. Bellmont, Jane and  Jack arguing for Frado's education; Mary and her mother objecting. At  last Mr. Bellmont declared decisively that she SHOULD go to school. He  was a man who seldom decided controversies at home. The word once spoken  admitted of no appeal; so, notwithstanding Mary's objection that she  would have to attend the same school she did, the word became law.    It was to be a new scene to Frado, and Jack had many queries and  conjectures to answer. He was himself too far advanced to attend the  summer school, which Frado regretted, having had too many opportunities  of witnessing Miss Mary's temper to feel safe in her company alone.    The opening day of school came. Frado sauntered on far in the rear of  Mary, who was ashamed to be seen \"walking with a nigger.\" As soon as she  appeared, with scanty clothing and bared feet, the children assembled,  noisily published her approach: \"See that nigger,\" shouted one. \"Look!  look!\" cried another. \"I won't play with her,\" said one little girl.  \"Nor I neither,\" replied another.    Mary evidently relished these sharp attacks, and saw a fair prospect of  lowering Nig where, according to her views, she belonged. Poor Frado,  chagrined and grieved, felt that her anticipations of pleasure at such a  place were far from being realized. She was just deciding to return  home, and never come there again, when the teacher appeared, and  observing the downcast looks of the child, took her by the hand, and led  her into the school-room. All followed, and, after the bustle of  securing seats was over, Miss Marsh inquired if the children knew \"any  cause for the sorrow of that little girl?\" pointing to Frado. It was  soon all told. She then reminded them of their duties to the poor and  friendless;"]]]
