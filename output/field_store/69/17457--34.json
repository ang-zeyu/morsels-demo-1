Whosoever gets  to the second arrow, shall have the second thing--the bag. He who gets  to the third arrow, shall have the third thing--the bowl. And he who  gets to the fourth arrow, shall have the last things--the stick and  rope.\" To this they agreed, and the prince shot off his first arrow.  Away raced the fakirs to get it. When they brought it back to him he  shot off the second, and when they had found and brought it to him he  shot off his third, and when they had brought him the third he shot  off the fourth.    While they were away looking for the fourth arrow the Raja's son let  his horse loose in the jungle, and sat on the bed, taking the bowl,  the stick and rope, and the bag with him. Then he said, \"Bed, I wish  to go to the Princess Labam's country.\" The little bed instantly rose  up into the air and began to fly, and it flew and flew till it came to  the Princess Labam's country, where it settled on the ground. The  Raja's son asked some men he saw, \"Whose country is this?\"    \"The Princess Labam's country,\" they answered. Then the prince went on  till he came to a house where he saw an old woman.    \"Who are you?\" she said. \"Where do you come from?\"    \"I come from a far country,\" he said; \"do let me stay with you  to-night.\"    \"No,\" she answered, \"I cannot let you stay with me; for our king has  ordered that men from other countries may not stay in his country. You  cannot stay in my house.\"    \"You are my aunty,\" said the prince; \"let me remain with you for this  one night. You see it is evening, and if I go into the jungle, then  the wild beasts will eat me.\"    \"Well,\" said the old woman, \"you may stay here to-night; but to-morrow  morning you must go away, for if the king hears you have passed the  night in my house, he will have me seized and put into prison.\"    Then she took him into her house, and the Raja's son was very glad.  The old woman began preparing dinner, but he stopped her, \"Aunty,\" he  said, \"I will give you food.\" He put his hand into his bag, saying,  \"Bag, I want some dinner,\" and the bag gave him instantly a delicious  dinner, served up on two gold plates. The old woman and the Raja's son  then dined together.    When they had finished eating, the old woman said, \"Now I will fetch  some water.\"    \"Don't go,\" said the prince. \"You shall have plenty of water  directly.\" So he took his bowl and said to it, \"Bowl, I want some  water,\" and then it filled with water. When it was full, the prince  cried out, \"Stop, bowl,\" and the bowl stopped filling. \"See, aunty,\"  he said, \"with this bowl I can always get as much water as I want.\"    By this time night had come. \"Aunty,\" said the Raja's son, \"why don't  you light a lamp?\"    \"There is no need,\" she said. \"Our king has forbidden the people in  his country to light any lamps; for, as soon as it is dark, his  daughter, the Princess Labam, comes and sits on her roof, and she  shines so that she lights up all the country and our houses, and we  can see to do our work as if it were day.\"    When it was quite black night the princess got up. She dressed herself  in her rich clothes and jewels, and rolled up her hair, and across her  head she put a band of diamonds and pearls. Then she shone like the  moon, and her beauty made night day. She came out of her room, and sat  on the roof of her palace. In the daytime she never came out of her  house; she only came out at night. All the people in her father's  country then went about their work and finished it.    The Raja's son watched the princess quietly, and was very happy. He  said to himself, \"How lovely she is!\"    At midnight, when everybody had gone to bed, the princess came down  from her roof, and went to her room; and when she was in bed and  asleep, the Raja's son got up softly, and sat on his bed. \"Bed,\" he  said to it, \"I want to go to the Princess Labam's bed-room.\" So the  little bed carried him to the room where she lay fast asleep.    The young Raja took his bag and said, \"I want a great deal of  betel-leaf,\" and it at once gave him quantities of betel-leaf. This he  laid near the princess's bed, and then his little bed carried him back  to the old woman's house.    Next morning all the princess's servants found the betel-leaf, and  began to eat it. \"Where did you get all that betel-leaf?\" asked the  princess.    \"We found it near your bed,\" answered the servants. Nobody knew the  prince had come in the night and put it all there.    In the morning the old woman came to the Raja's son. \"Now it is  morning,\" she said, \"and you must go; for if the king finds out all I  have done for you, he will seize me.\"    \"I am ill to-day, dear aunty,\" said the prince; \"do let me stay till  to-morrow morning.\"    \"Good,\" said the old woman. So he stayed, and they took their dinner  out of the bag, and the bowl gave them water.    When night came the princess got up and sat on her roof, and at twelve  o'clock, when every one was in bed, she went to her bed-room, and was  soon fast asleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed, and it carried  him to the princess. He took his bag and said, \"Bag, I want a most  lovely shawl.\" It gave him a splendid shawl, and he spread it over the  princess as she lay asleep. Then he went back to the old woman's house  and slept till morning.    In the morning, when the princess saw the shawl she was delighted.  \"See, mother,\" she said; \"Khuda must have given me this shawl, it is  so beautiful.\" Her mother was very glad too.    \"Yes, my child,\" she said; \"Khuda must have given you this splendid  shawl.\"    When it was morning the old woman said to the Raja's son, \"Now you  must really go.\"    \"Aunty,\" he answered, \"I am not well enough yet. Let me stay a few  days longer. I will remain hidden in your house, so that no one may  see me.\" So the old woman let him stay.    When it was black night, the princess put on her lovely clothes and  jewels, and sat on her roof. At midnight she went to her room and went  to sleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed and flew to her bed-room.  There he said to his bag, \"Bag, I want a very, very beautiful ring.\"  The bag gave him a glorious ring. Then he took the Princess Labam's  hand gently to put on the ring, and she started up very much  frightened.    \"Who are you?\" she said to the prince. \"Where do you come from? Why do  you come to my room?\"    \"Do not be afraid, princess,\" he said; \"I am no thief. I am a great  Raja's son. Hiraman parrot, who lives in the jungle where I went to  hunt, told me your name, and then I left my father and mother, and  came to see you.\"    \"Well,\" said the princess, \"as you are the son of such a great Raja,  I will not have you killed, and I will tell my father and mother that  I wish to marry you.\"    The prince then returned to the old woman's house; and when morning  came the princess said to her mother, \"The son of a great Raja has  come to this country, and I wish to marry him.\" Her mother told this  to the king.    \"Good,\" said the king; \"but if this Raja's son wishes to marry my  daughter, he must first do whatever I bid him. If he fails I will kill  him. I will give him eighty pounds weight of mustard seed, and out of  this he must crush the oil in one day. If he cannot do this he shall  die.\"    In the morning the Raja's son told the old woman that he intended to  marry the princess. \"Oh,\" said the old woman, \"go away from this  country, and do not think of marrying her. A great many Rajas and  Rajas' sons have come here to marry her, and her father has had them  all killed. He says whoever wishes to marry his daughter must first do  whatever he bids him. If he can, then he shall marry the princess; if  he cannot, the king will have him killed. But no one can do the things  the king tells him to do; so all the Rajas and Rajas' sons who have  tried have been put to death. You will be killed too, if you try. Do  go away.\" But the prince would not listen to anything she said.    The king sent for the prince to the old woman's house, and his  servants brought the Raja's son to the king's court-house to the king.  There the king gave him eighty pounds of mustard seed, and told him to  crush all the oil out of it that day, and bring it next morning to him  to the court-house. \"Whoever wishes to marry my daughter,\" he said to  the prince, \"must first do all I tell him. If he cannot, then I have  him killed. So if you cannot crush all the oil out of this mustard  seed, you will die.\"    The prince was very sorry when he heard this. \"How can I crush the oil  out of all this mustard seed in one day?\" he said to himself; \"and if  I do not, the king will kill me.\" He took the mustard seed to the old  woman's house, and did not know what to do. At last he remembered the  Ant-Raja, and the moment he did so, the Ant-Raja and his ants came to  him. \"Why do you look so sad?\" said the Ant-Raja.    The prince showed him the mustard seed, and said to him, \"How can I  crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day? And if I do not  take the oil to the king to-morrow morning, he will kill me.\"    \"Be happy,\" said the Ant-Raja; \"lie down and sleep; we will crush all  the oil out for you during the day, and to-morrow morning you shall  take it to the king.\" The Raja's son lay down and slept, and the ants  crushed out the oil for him. The prince was very glad when he saw the  oil.    The next morning he took it to the court-house to the king. But the  king said, \"You cannot yet marry my daughter. If you wish to do so,  you must first fight with my two demons and kill them.\" The king a  long time ago had caught two demons, and then, as he did not know what  to do with them, he had shut them up in a cage. He was afraid to let  them loose for fear they would eat up all the people in his country;  and he did not know how to kill them. So all the kings and kings' sons  who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/713"],[0,"Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions — Volume 2 (#3)"],[1,"zeal, as warm and as blind as that of Peter the Hermit. The  latter opinion seems to be the true one. Society did not calculate the  consequences of what it was doing. Every man seemed to act from impulse  only; and the Pope, in throwing himself into the heart of France, acted  as much from impulse as the thousands who responded to his call. A  council was eventually summoned to meet him at Clermont, in Auvergne,  to consider the state of the church, reform abuses, and, above all,  make preparations for the war. It was in the midst of an extremely cold  winter, and the ground was covered with snow. During seven days the  council sat with closed doors, while immense crowds from all parts of  France flocked into the town, in expectation that the Pope himself  would address the people. All the towns and villages for miles around  were filled with the multitude; even the fields were encumbered with  people, who, unable to procure lodging, pitched their tents under the  trees and by the way-side. All the neighbourhood presented the  appearance of a vast camp.    During the seven days' deliberation, a sentence of excommunication was  passed upon King Philip for adultery with Bertrade de Montfort,  Countess of Anjou, and for disobedience to the supreme authority of the  apostolic see. This bold step impressed the people with reverence for  so stern a church, which in the discharge of its duty showed itself no  respecter of persons. Their love and their fear were alike increased,  and they were prepared to listen with more intense devotion to the  preaching of so righteous and inflexible a pastor. The great square  before the cathedral church of Clermont became every instant more  densely crowded as the hour drew nigh when the Pope was to address the  populace. Issuing from the church in his frill canonicals, surrounded  by his cardinals and bishops in all the splendour of Romish  ecclesiastical costume, the Pope stood before the populace on a high  scaffolding erected for the occasion, and covered with scarlet cloth.  A brilliant array of bishops and cardinals surrounded him; and among  them, humbler in rank, but more important in the world's eye, the  Hermit Peter, dressed in his simple and austere habiliments.  Historians differ as to whether or not Peter addressed the crowd, but  as all agree that he was present, it seems reasonable to suppose that  he spoke. But it was the oration of the Pope that was most important.  As he lifted up his hands to ensure attention, every voice immediately  became still. He began by detailing the miseries endured by their  brethren in the Holy Land; how the plains of Palestine were desolated  by the outrageous heathen, who with the sword and the firebrand carried  wailing into the dwellings and flames into the possessions of the  faithful; how Christian wives and daughters were defiled by pagan lust;  how the altars of the true God were desecrated, and the relics of the  saints trodden under foot. \"You,\" continued the eloquent pontiff, (and  Urban the Second was one of the most eloquent men of the day,) \"you,  who hear me, and who have received the true faith, and been endowed by  God with power, and strength, and greatness of soul,--whose ancestors  have been the prop of Christendom, and whose kings have put a barrier  against the progress of the infidel,--I call upon you to wipe off these  impurities from the face of the earth, and lift your oppressed  fellow-christians from the depths into which they have been trampled.  The sepulchre of Christ is possessed by the heathen, the sacred places  dishonoured by their vileness. Oh, brave knights and faithful people!  offspring of invincible fathers! ye will not degenerate from your  ancient renown. Ye will not be restrained from embarking in this great  cause by the tender ties of wife or little ones, but will remember the  words of the Saviour of the world himself, 'Whosoever loves father and  mother more than me is not worthy of me.  Whosoever shall abandon for  my name's sake his house, or his brethren, or his sisters, or his  father, or his mother, or his wife, or his children, or his lands,  shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.'\"    The warmth of the pontiff communicated itself to the crowd, and the  enthusiasm of the people broke out several times ere he concluded his  address. He went on to pourtray, not only the spiritual but the  temporal advantages, that should accrue to those who took up arms in  the service of the Cross. Palestine was, he said, a land flowing with  milk and honey, and precious in the sight of God, as the scene of the  grand events which had saved mankind. That land, he promised, should be  divided among them. Moreover, they should have full pardon for all  their offences, either against God or man. \"Go, then,\" he added, \"in  expiation of your sins; and go assured, that after this world shall  have passed away, imperishable glory shall be yours in the world which  is to come.\" The enthusiasm was no longer to be restrained, and loud  shouts interrupted the speaker; the people exclaiming as if with one  voice, \"Dieu le veult! Dieu le veult!\" With great presence of mind  Urban took advantage of the outburst, and as soon as silence was  obtained, continued: \"Dear brethren, to-day is shown forth in you that  which the Lord has said by his evangelist, 'When two or three are  gathered together in my name, there will I be in the midst of them to  bless them.' If the Lord God had not been in your souls, you would not  all have pronounced the same words; or rather God himself pronounced  them by your lips, for it was He that put them in your hearts. Be they,  then, your war-cry in the combat, for those words came forth from God.  Let the army of the Lord when it rushes upon His enemies shout but that  one cry, 'Dieu le veult! Dieu le veult!'  Let whoever is inclined to  devote himself to this holy cause make it a solemn engagement, and bear  the cross of the Lord either on his breast or his brow till he set out,  and let him who is ready to begin his march place the holy emblem on  his shoulders, in memory of that precept of our Saviour, 'He who does  not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.'\"    The news of this council spread to the remotest parts of Europe in an  incredibly short space of time. Long before the fleetest horseman could  have brought the intelligence it was known by the people in distant  provinces, a fact which was considered as nothing less than  supernatural. But the subject was in everybody's mouth, and the minds  of men were prepared for the result. The enthusiastic only asserted  what they wished, and the event tallied with their prediction. This  was, however, quite enough in those days for a miracle, and as a  miracle every one regarded it.    For several months after the council of Clermont, France and Germany  presented a singular spectacle. The pious, the fanatic, the needy, the  dissolute, the young and the old, even women and children, and the halt  and lame, enrolled themselves by hundreds. In every village the clergy  were busied in keeping up the excitement, promising eternal rewards to  those who assumed the red cross, and fulminating the most awful  denunciations against all the worldly-minded who refused or even  hesitated. Every debtor who joined the crusade was freed by the papal  edict from the claims of his creditors; outlaws of every grade were  made equal with the honest upon the same conditions.  The property of  those who went was placed under the protection of the church, and St.  Paul and St. Peter themselves were believed to descend from their high  abode, to watch over the chattels of the absent pilgrims. Signs and  portents were seen in the air to increase the fervour of the multitude.  An aurora-borealis of unusual brilliancy appeared, and thousands of the  crusaders came out to gaze upon it, prostrating themselves upon the  earth in adoration. It was thought to be a sure prognostic of the  interposition of the Most High; and a representation of his armies  fighting with and overthrowing the infidels. Reports of wonders were  everywhere rife. A monk had seen two gigantic warriors on horseback,  the one representing a Christian and the other a Turk, fighting in the  sky with flaming swords, the Christian of course overcoming the Paynim.  Myriads of stars were said to have fallen from heaven, each  representing the fall of a Pagan foe.  It was believed at the same time  that the Emperor Charlemagne would rise from the grave, and lead on to  victory the embattled armies of the Lord. A singular feature of the  popular madness was the enthusiasm of the women. Everywhere they  encouraged their lovers and husbands to forsake all things for the holy  war. Many of them burned the sign of the cross upon their breasts and  arms, and coloured the wound with a red dye, as a lasting memorial of  their zeal. Others, still more zealous, impressed the mark by the same  means upon the tender limbs of young children and infants at the breast.    Guibert de Nogent tells of a monk who made a large incision upon his  forehead in the form of a cross, which he coloured with some powerful  ingredient, telling the people that an angel had done it when he was  asleep. This monk appears to have been more of a rogue than a fool, for  he contrived to fare more sumptuously than any of his brother pilgrims,  upon the strength of his sanctity. The crusaders everywhere gave him  presents of food and money, and he became quite fat ere he arrived at  Jerusalem, notwithstanding the fatigues of the way. If he had  acknowledged in the first place that he had made the wound himself, he  would not have been thought more holy than his fellows; but the story  of the angel was a clincher.    All those who had property of any description rushed to the mart to  change it into hard cash. Lands and houses could be had for a quarter  of their value, while arms and"]]]
