The child had kissed her uncle and aunt affectionately before she went  upstairs, and now she looked around her little room rather wistfully,  gazing at the simple trinkets and worn calico and gingham dresses, as  if they were old friends.  She was tempted at first to make a bundle of  them, yet she knew very well that they would be of no use to her in her  future life.    She sat down upon a broken-backed chair--the only one the room  contained--and holding Toto in her arms waited patiently until the  clock struck four.    Then she made the secret signal that had been agreed upon between her  and Ozma.    Uncle Henry and Aunt Em waited downstairs.  They were uneasy and a good  deal excited, for this is a practical humdrum world, and it seemed to  them quite impossible that their little niece could vanish from her  home and travel instantly to fairyland.    So they watched the stairs, which seemed to be the only way that  Dorothy could get out of the farmhouse, and they watched them a long  time.  They heard the clock strike four but there was no sound from  above.    Half-past four came, and now they were too impatient to wait any  longer.  Softly, they crept up the stairs to the door of the little  girl's room.    \"Dorothy!  Dorothy!\" they called.    There was no answer.    They opened the door and looked in.    The room was empty.        3.  How Ozma Granted Dorothy's Request    I suppose you have read so much about the magnificent Emerald City that  there is little need for me to describe it here.  It is the Capital  City of the Land of Oz, which is justly considered the most attractive  and delightful fairyland in all the world.    The Emerald City is built all of beautiful marbles in which are set a  profusion of emeralds, every one exquisitely cut and of very great  size.  There are other jewels used in the decorations inside the houses  and palaces, such as rubies, diamonds, sapphires, amethysts and  turquoises.  But in the streets and upon the outside of the buildings  only emeralds appear, from which circumstance the place is named the  Emerald City of Oz.  It has nine thousand, six hundred and fifty-four  buildings, in which lived fifty-seven thousand three hundred and  eighteen people, up to the time my story opens.    All the surrounding country, extending to the borders of the desert  which enclosed it upon every side, was full of pretty and comfortable  farmhouses, in which resided those inhabitants of Oz who preferred  country to city life.    Altogether there were more than half a million people in the Land of  Oz--although some of them, as you will soon learn, were not made of  flesh and blood as we are--and every inhabitant of that favored country  was happy and prosperous.    No disease of any sort was ever known among the Ozites, and so no one  ever died unless he met with an accident that prevented him from  living.  This happened very seldom, indeed.  There were no poor people  in the Land of Oz, because there was no such thing as money, and all  property of every sort belonged to the Ruler.  The people were her  children, and she cared for them.  Each person was given freely by his  neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as any one  may reasonably desire.  Some tilled the lands and raised great crops of  grain, which was divided equally among the entire population, so that  all had enough.  There were many tailors and dressmakers and shoemakers  and the like, who made things that any who desired them might wear.  Likewise there were jewelers who made ornaments for the person, which  pleased and beautified the people, and these ornaments also were free  to those who asked for them.  Each man and woman, no matter what he or  she produced for the good of the community, was supplied by the  neighbors with food and clothing and a house and furniture and  ornaments and games.  If by chance the supply ever ran short, more was  taken from the great storehouses of the Ruler, which were afterward  filled up again when there was more of any article than the people  needed.    Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people  enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be  occupied and to have something to do.  There were no cruel overseers  set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with  them.  So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and  neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.    You will know by what I have here told you, that the Land of Oz was a  remarkable country.  I do not suppose such an arrangement would be  practical with us, but Dorothy assures me that it works finely with the  Oz people.    Oz being a fairy country, the people were, of course, fairy people; but  that does not mean that all of them were very unlike the people of our  own world.  There were all sorts of queer characters among them, but  not a single one who was evil, or who possessed a selfish or violent  nature.  They were peaceful, kind hearted, loving and merry, and every  inhabitant adored the beautiful girl who ruled them and delighted to  obey her every command.    In spite of all I have said in a general way, there were some parts of  the Land of Oz not quite so pleasant as the farming country and the  Emerald City which was its center.  Far away in the South Country there  lived in the mountains a band of strange people called Hammer-Heads,  because they had no arms and used their flat heads to pound any one who  came near them.  Their necks were like rubber, so that they could shoot  out their heads to quite a distance, and afterward draw them back again  to their shoulders.  The Hammer-Heads were called the \"Wild People,\"  but never harmed any but those who disturbed them in the mountains  where they lived.    In some of the dense forests there lived great beasts of every sort;  yet these were for the most part harmless and even sociable, and  conversed agreeably with those who visited their haunts.  The  Kalidahs--beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers--had once  been fierce and bloodthirsty, but even they were now nearly all tamed,  although at times one or another of them would get cross and  disagreeable.    Not so tame were the Fighting Trees, which had a forest of their own.  If any one approached them these curious trees would bend down their  branches, twine them around the intruders, and hurl them away.    But these unpleasant things existed only in a few remote parts of the  Land of Oz.  I suppose every country has some drawbacks, so even this  almost perfect fairyland could not be quite perfect.  Once there had  been wicked witches in the land, too; but now these had all been  destroyed; so, as I said, only peace and happiness reigned in Oz.    For some time Ozma had ruled over this fair country, and never was  Ruler more popular or beloved.  She is said to be the most beautiful  girl the world has ever known, and her heart and mind are as lovely as  her person.    Dorothy Gale had several times visited the Emerald City and experienced  adventures in the Land of Oz, so that she and Ozma had now become firm  friends.  The girl Ruler had even made Dorothy a Princess of Oz, and  had often implored her to come to Ozma's stately palace and live there  always; but Dorothy had been loyal to her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, who  had cared for her since she was a baby, and she had refused to leave  them because she knew they would be lonely without her.    However, Dorothy now realized that things were going to be different  with her uncle and aunt from this time forth, so after giving the  matter deep thought she decided to ask Ozma to grant her a very great  favor.    A few seconds after she had made the secret signal in her little  bedchamber, the Kansas girl was seated in a lovely room in Ozma's  palace in the Emerald City of Oz.  When the first loving kisses and  embraces had been exchanged, the fair Ruler inquired:    \"What is the matter, dear?  I know something unpleasant has happened to  you, for your face was very sober when I saw it in my Magic Picture.  And whenever you signal me to transport you to this safe place, where  you are always welcome, I know you are in danger or in trouble.\"    Dorothy sighed.    \"This time, Ozma, it isn't I,\" she replied.  \"But it's worse, I guess,  for Uncle Henry and Aunt Em are in a heap of trouble, and there seems  no way for them to get out of it--anyhow, not while they live in  Kansas.\"    \"Tell me about it, Dorothy,\" said Ozma, with ready sympathy.    \"Why, you see Uncle Henry is poor; for the farm in Kansas doesn't  'mount to much, as farms go.  So one day Uncle Henry borrowed some  money, and wrote a letter saying that if he didn't pay the money back  they could take his farm for pay.  Course he 'spected to pay by making  money from the farm; but he just couldn't.  An' so they're going to  take the farm, and Uncle Henry and Aunt Em won't have any place to  live.  They're pretty old to do much hard work, Ozma; so I'll have to  work for them, unless--\"    Ozma had been thoughtful during the story, but now she smiled and  pressed her little friend's hand.    \"Unless what, dear?\" she asked.    Dorothy hesitated, because her request meant so much to them all.    \"Well,\" said she, \"I'd like to live here in the Land of Oz, where  you've often 'vited me to live.  But I can't, you know, unless Uncle  Henry and Aunt Em could live here too.\"    \"Of course not,\" exclaimed the Ruler of Oz, laughing gaily.  \"So, in  order to get you, little friend, we must invite your Uncle and Aunt to  live in Oz, also.\"    \"Oh, will you, Ozma?\" cried Dorothy, clasping her chubby little hands  eagerly.  \"Will you bring them here with the Magic Belt, and give them  a nice little farm in the Munchkin Country, or the Winkie Country--or  some other place?\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5173"],[0,"The Religion of the Samurai (#3)"],[1,"times.      [FN#15]  \"If a wise man hold his body with its three parts (chest,  neck, and head) erect, and turn his senses with the mind towards the  heart, he will then in the boat of Brahman cross all the torrents  which cause fear.    \"Compressing his breathings let him, who has subdued all motions,  breathe forth through the nose with the gentle breath.  Let the wise  man without fail restrain his mind, that chariot yoked with vicious  horses.    \"Let him perform his exercises in a place level, pure, free from  pebbles, fire, and dust, delightful by its sounds, its water, and  bowers; not painful to the eye, and full of shelters and eaves.    \"When Yoga, is being performed, the forms which come first, producing  apparitions in Brahman, are those of misty smoke, sun, fire, wind,  fire-flies, lightnings, and a crystal moon.    \"When, as earth, water, light, heat, and ether arises, the fivefold  quality of Yoga takes place, then there is no longer illness, old  age, or pain for him who has obtained a body produced by the fire of  Yoga.    The first results of Yoga they call lightness, healthiness,  steadiness, a good complexion, an easy pronunciation, a sweet odour,  and slight excretions \"(Cvet. Upanisad, ii. 8-13).    \"When the five instruments of knowledge stand still together with the  mind, and when the intellect does not move, that is called the  highest state.    \"This, the firm holding back of the senses, is what is called Yoga.  He must be free from thoughtlessness then, for Yoga comes and goes\"  (Katha Upanisad, ii. 10, 11).    \"This is the rule for achieving it (viz., concentration of the mind  on the object of meditation): restraint of the breath, restraint of  the senses, meditation, fixed attention, investigation,  absorption-these are called the sixfold Yoga.  When beholding by this  Yoga, be beholds the gold-coloured maker, the lord, the person,  Brahman, the cause; then the sage, leaving behind good and evil,  makes everything (breath, organs of sense, body, etc.) to be one in  the Highest Indestructible (in the pratyagatman or Brahman) \" (Maitr.  Upanisad, vi. 18).    \"And thus it has been elsewhere: There is the superior fixed  attention (dharana) for him-viz., if he presses the tip of the tongue  down the palate, and restrain the voice, mind, and breath, he sees  Brahman by discrimination (taraka).  And when, after the cessation of  mind, he sees his own Self, smaller than small, and shining as the  Highest Self, then, having seen his Self as the Self, he becomes  Self-less, and because he is Self-less, he is without limit, without  cause, absorbed in thought.  This is the highest mystery--viz., final  liberation \" (Maitr. Upanisad, vi. 20).    Amrtab. Upanisad, 18, describes three modes of sitting-namely, the  Lotus-seat (Padmasana), the sitting with legs bent underneath; the  mystic diagram seat (Svastika); and the auspicious-seat  (Bhadrasana);--while Yogacikha directs the choice of the  Lotus-posture, with attention concentrated on the tip of the nose,  hands and feet closely joined.      But Brahmanic Zen was carefully distinguished even by early  Buddhists[FN#16] as the heterodox Zen from that taught by the Buddha.   Our Zen originated in the Enlightenment of Shakya Muni, which took  place in his thirtieth year, when he was sitting absorbed in profound  meditation under the Bodhi Tree.      [FN#16]  The anonymous author of Lankavatara-sutra distinguishes the  heterodox Zen from the Hinayana Zen, the Hinayana Zen from the  Mahayana Zen, and calls the last by the name of the Buddha's Holy  Zen.  The sutra is believed by many Buddhists, not without reason, to  be the exposition of that Mahayana doctrine which Acvaghosa restated  in his Craddhotpada-castra.  The sutra was translated, first, into  Chinese by Gunabbadra, in A.D. 443; secondly, by Bodhiruci in A.D.  513; and, thirdly, by Ciksanada in A.D. 700-704.  The book is famous  for its prophecy about Nagdrajuna, which (according to Dr. Nanjo's  translation) is as follows:    \"After the Nirvana of the Tathagata,  There will be a man in the future,  Listen to me carefully, O Mahatma,  A man who will hold my law.  In the great country of South,  There will be a venerable Bhiksu  The Bodhisattva Nagarjuna by name,  Who will destroy the views of Astikas and Nastikas,  Who will preach unto men my Yana,  The highest Law of the Mahayana,  And will attain to the Pramudita-bhumi.\"      It is said that then he awoke to the perfect truth and declared: \"All  animated and inanimate beings are Enlightened at the same time.\"  According to the tradition[FN#17] of this sect Shakya Muni  transmitted his mysterious doctrine from mind to mind to his oldest  disciple Mahakacyapa at the assembly hold on the Mount of Holy  Vulture, and the latter was acknowledged as the first patriarch, who,  in turn, transmitted the doctrine to Ananda, the second patriarch,  and so till Bodhidharma, the twenty-eighth[FN#18] patriarch.  We have  little to say about the historical value of this tradition, but it is  worth while to note that the list of the names of these twenty-eight  patriarchs contains many eminent scholars of Mahayanism, or the later  developed school of Buddhism, such as Acvaghosa,[FN#19]  Nagarjuna,[FN#20] Kanadeva,[FN#21] and Vasubhandhu.[FN#22]      [FN#17]  The incident is related as follows: When the Buddha was at  the assembly on the Mount of Holy Vulture, there came a Brahmaraja  who offered the Teacher a golden flower, and asked him to preach the  Dharma.  The Buddha took the flower and held it aloft in his hand,  gazing at it in perfect silence.  None in the assembly could  understand what he meant, except the venerable Mahakacyapa, who  smiled at the Teacher.  Then the Buddha said: \"I have the Eye and  Treasury of Good Dharma, Nirvana, the Wonderful Spirit, which I now  hand over to Mahakacyapa.\"  The book in which this incident is  described is entitled 'Sutra on the Great Brahman King's Questioning  Buddha to Dispel a Doubt,' but there exists no original text nor any  Chinese translation in the Tripitaka.  It is highly probable that  some early Chinese Zen scholar of the Sung dynasty (A.D. 960-1126)  fabricated the tradition, because Wang Ngan Shih (O-an-seki), a  powerful Minister under the Emperor Shan Tsung (Shin-so, A.D.  1068-1085), is said to have seen the book in the Imperial Library.  There is, however, no evidence, as far as we know, pointing to the  existence of the Sutra in China.  In Japan there exists, in a form of  manuscript, two different translations of that book, kept in secret  veneration by some Zen masters, which have been proved to be  fictitious by the present writer after his close examination of the  contents.  See the Appendix to his Zen-gaku-hi-han-ron.    [FN#18]  The following is the list of the names of the twenty-eight  patriarchs:    1. Mahakacyapa.  2. Ananda.  3. Canavasu.  4. Upagupta.  5. Dhrtaka.  6. Micchaka.  7. Vasumitra.  8. Buddhanandi.  9. Buddhamitra.  10. Parcva.  11. Punyayacas.  12. Acvaghosa.  13. Kapimala.  14. Nagarjuna.  15. Kanadeva.  16. Rahulata.  17. Samghanandi.  18. Samghayacas.  19. Kumarata.  20. Jayata.  21. Vasubandhu.  22. Manura.  23. Haklanayacas.  24. Simha.  25. Vacasuta.  26. Punyamitra.  27. Prajnyatara.  28. Bodhidharma.    The first twenty-three patriarchs are exactly the same as those given  in 'The Sutra on the Nidana of transmitting Dharmapitaka,' translated  in A.D. 472.  King Teh Chwen Tang Iuh (Kei-toku-den-to-roku), a  famous Zen history of China, gives two elaborate narratives about the  transmission of Right Dharma from teacher to disciple through these  twenty-eight patriarchs, to be trusted without hesitation.  It would  not be difficult for any scholar of sense to find these statements  were made from the same motive as that of the anonymous author who  gives a short life, in Dirghagama-sutra, of each of the six Buddhas,  the predecessors of Shakya Muni, if he carefully compare the list  given above with the lists of the patriarchs of the Sarvastivada  school given by San Yin (So-yu died A.D. 518) in his Chuh San Tsung  Ki (Shutsu-san zo-ki).    [FN#19]  One of the founders of Mahayana Buddhism, who flourished in  the first century A.D.  There exists a life of his translated into  Chinese by Kumarajiva in A.D. 401-409.

[FN#21]  Sometimes called Aryadeva, a successor of Nagarjuna.  A life  of his was translated into Chinese by Kumarajiva in A.D. 401-409.  The following are his important works: Cata-castra, 'Castra by the  Bodhisattva Deva on the refutation of four heretical Hinayana schools  mentioned in the Lankatvatara-sutra'; 'Castra by the Bodhisattva Deva  on the explanation of the Nirvana by twenty Hinayana teachers  mentioned in the Lankavatara-sutra.'
