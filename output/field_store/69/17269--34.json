All truth is of  value--above price indeed in its place; yet with respect to their  possible application, some truths are of incomparably greater worth  than are others. A knowledge of the principles of trade is essential  to the success of the merchant; an acquaintance with the laws of  navigation is demanded of the mariner; familiarity with the relation  of soil and crops is indispensable to the farmer; an understanding of  the profound principles of mathematics is necessary to the engineer  and the astronomer; so too is a practical knowledge of God essential  to the salvation of every human soul that has attained to powers of  judgment and discretion. The value of theological knowledge,  therefore, ought not to be under-rated; it is doubtful if its  importance can in any way be over-estimated.    =2. What is Theology?=--The word \"theology\" is of Greek origin; it  comes to us from _Theos_, meaning God, and _logos_--a treatise, or  discourse, signifying by derivation, therefore, collated knowledge of  Divinity, or the science that teaches us of God, implying also the  relation existing between the Supreme Being and His creatures. The  term is of very ancient usage, and may be traced to pagan sources.  Plato and Aristotle speak of theology as the doctrine of Deity and  divine things. Concisely defined, theology \"is that revealed science  which treats of the being and attributes of God, His relations to us,  the dispensations of His providence, His will with respect to our  actions, and His purposes with respect to our end.\"[1]      [1] See Doc. & Cov. supplement to Lecture I on Faith; Buck's    Theological Dictionary, p. 582.    =3.= It has been held by some as a truth, that theological knowledge  is not properly a subject for analytical and otherwise scientific  treatment on the part of man; that inasmuch as a true conception of  Deity, with which theology has primarily to deal, must necessarily be  based upon revelation from the source divine, we can but receive such  knowledge as it is graciously given; and that to attempt critical  investigation thereof by the fallible powers of human judgment would  be to apply as a measure of the doings of God the utterly inadequate  wisdom of man. Many truths are beyond the scope of unaided human  reason, and theological facts have been declared to be above reason;  this is true so far as the same remark might be applied to any other  kind of truth; for all truth, being eternal, is superior to reason in  the sense of being manifest to reason, but not a creation of reason;  nevertheless truths are to be estimated and compared by the exercise  of reason.    =4. The Extent of Theology.=--Who can survey the boundaries of this  science? It deals with Deity--the fountain of knowledge, the source of  wisdom; with the proofs of the existence of a Supreme Being, and of  other supernatural personalities; with the conditions under which, and  the means by which, divine revelation is imparted; with the eternal  principles governing the creation of worlds; with the laws of nature  in all their varied manifestations. Primarily, theology is the science  of God and religion; it seeks to present \"the systematic exhibition of  revealed truth, the science of Christian faith and life.\" But in a  more general sense, theology has to do with other truths than those  which are specifically called spiritual; its domain is co-extensive  with that of truth.    =5.= The industrial pursuits that benefit mankind, the arts that  please and refine, the sciences that enlarge and exalt the mind, are  but fragments of the great though yet uncompleted volume of truth that  has come to earth from a source of eternal and infinite supply. The  comprehensive study of theology, therefore, would embrace all known  truths. God has constituted Himself as the great teacher;[2] by  personal manifestations or through the ministrations of His appointed  servants, He instructs His mortal children. To Adam He introduced the  art of agriculture,[3] and even taught by example that of  tailoring;[4] to Noah and Nephi He gave instructions in ship  building;[5] Lehi and Nephi were taught of Him in the arts of  navigation;[6] and for their guidance on the water, as in their  journeyings on land, He prepared for them the Liahona.[7] a compass  operated by a force more effective than that of terrestrial  magnetism; furthermore, Moses received divine instructions in  architecture.[8]      [2] See Key to Theology, by Parley P. Pratt, chap. i.      [3] Gen. ii, 8; Pearl of Great Price: Moses iii, 15.      [4] Gen. iii, 21; Pearl of Great Price: Moses iv, 27.      [5] Gen. vi, 14: I Nephi xvii, 8; xviii, 1-4.      [6] I Nephi xviii, 12, 21.      [7] I Nephi xvi, 10, 16, 26-30; xviii, 12, 21; Alma xxxvii, 38.      [8] Exo. xxv, xxvi, xxvii.    =6. Theology and Religion=, though closely related, are by no means  identical. A person may be deeply versed in theological lore, and yet  be lacking in religious, and even in moral traits. Theology may be  compared to theory, while religion represents practice; if theology be  precept, then religion is example. Each should be the complement of  the other; theological knowledge should strengthen religious faith and  practice. As accepted by the Latter-day Saints, theology comprehends  the whole plan of the gospel. \"Theology is ordered knowledge,  representing in the region of the intellect what religion represents  in the heart and life of man.\"[9] Knowledge may have to do with the  intellect only, and however sublime its import, it may fail to affect  the hardened heart.      [9] W. E. Gladstone.    =7. The \"Articles of Faith.\"=--The beliefs and prescribed practices of  most religious sects are usually set forth in formal creeds. The  Latter-day Saints announce no creed as a complete code of their faith;  for while they hold that the precepts of eternal life are  unchangeable, they accept the principle of continuous revelation as a  characteristic feature of their belief. However, when asked for a  concise presentation of the principal religious views of his people,  Joseph Smith, the first prophet of the Church in the present  dispensation, announced as a declaration of belief the \"Articles of  Faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\" These  include the more essential and characteristic features of the gospel  as accepted by this Church; but they are not complete as an exposition  of our belief, for by one of the Articles it is declared, \"We believe  all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we  believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things  pertaining to the Kingdom of God.\" From the time of their first  promulgation, the Articles of Faith have been accepted by the  people,[10] and on October 6, 1890, the Latter-day Saints, in general  conference assembled, re-adopted the Articles as part of their guide  in faith and conduct. As these Articles of Faith present the leading  tenets of the Church in systematic order, they suggest themselves as a  convenient outline for our plan of study.      [10] See Note 1.    =8. The Standard Works of the Church= form our written authority in  doctrine; but they are by no means our only sources of information and  instruction on the theology of the Church. We believe that God is as  willing to-day as He ever has been to reveal His mind and will to man,  and that He does so through chosen and appointed channels. We rely  therefore on the teachings of the living oracles of God as of equal  validity with the doctrines of the written word, the men in chief  authority being acknowledged and accepted by the Church as prophets  and revelators, and as being in possession of the power of the holy  Priesthood. The written works adopted by the vote of the Church as  authoritative guides in faith and doctrine are four,--the Bible, the  Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great  Price. Other works have been and are being issued by officers and  members of the Church, and many such books are unreservedly sanctioned  by the people and their ecclesiastical authorities; but the four  publications named are the only regularly constituted standard works  of the Church. Of the doctrine treated in the authorized standards,  the Articles of Faith may be regarded as a fair, though necessarily  but an incomplete epitome.      JOSEPH SMITH, THE PROPHET.    =9. Joseph Smith=, whose name is appended to the Articles of Faith,  was the prophet through whom the Lord restored to earth in these the  last days the Gospel, and this in accordance with predictions made in  previous dispensations. The question of the divine authenticity of  this man's mission is an all-important one to earnest investigators of  Latter-day Saint doctrines. If his claims to a God-given appointment  be false, forming, as they do, the foundation of the Church in the  last dispensation, the superstructure cannot be stable; if, however,  his purported ordination under the hands of heavenly personages be a  fact, one need search no further for the cause of the phenomenal  strength and growing power of the restored Church. The circumstances  of the divine dealings with Joseph Smith, the marvelous development of  the work instituted by this modern prophet, the fulfilment through his  instrumentality of many of the grandest predictions of old, and his  own prophetic utterances with their literal realizations, will yet be  widely acknowledged as proof conclusive of the validity of his  ministry.[11] The exalted claims maintained for him and his life's  work, the fame that has made his name known for good or evil among  most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42243"],[0,"The Hour of the Dragon (#3)"],[1,"out on Mitra, and muttered against the king; for somehow,  throughout the kingdom, the word was whispered that the king was  secretly addicted to loathsome practises and foul debauches in the  seclusion of his nighted palace. And then in that palace death stalked  grinning on feet about which swirled the monstrous vapors of the plague.  In one night the king died with his three sons, and the drums that  thundered their dirge drowned the grim and ominous bells that rang from  the carts that lumbered through the streets gathering up the rotting  dead.    That night, just before dawn, the hot wind that had blown for weeks  ceased to rustle evilly through the silken window curtains. Out of the  north rose a great wind that roared among the towers, and there was  cataclysmic thunder, and blinding sheets of lightning, and driving rain.  But the dawn shone clean and green and clear; the scorched ground veiled  itself in grass, the thirsty crops sprang up anew, and the plague was  gone--its miasma swept clean out of the land by the mighty wind.    Men said the gods were satisfied because the evil king and his spawn  were slain, and when his young brother Tarascus was crowned in the great  coronation hall, the populace cheered until the towers rocked,  acclaiming the monarch on whom the gods smiled.    Such a wave of enthusiasm and rejoicing as swept the land is frequently  the signal for a war of conquest. So no one was surprised when it was  announced that King Tarascus had declared the truce made by the late  king with their western neighbors void, and was gathering his hosts to  invade Aquilonia. His reason was candid; his motives, loudly proclaimed,  gilded his actions with something of the glamor of a crusade. He  espoused the cause of Valerius, 'rightful heir to the throne'; he came,  he proclaimed, not as an enemy of Aquilonia, but as a friend, to free  the people from the tyranny of a usurper and a foreigner.    If there were cynical smiles in certain quarters, and whispers  concerning the king's good friend Amalric, whose vast personal wealth  seemed to be flowing into the rather depleted royal treasury, they were  unheeded in the general wave of fervor and zeal of Tarascus' popularity.  If any shrewd individuals suspected that Amalric was the real ruler of  Nemedia, behind the scenes, they were careful not to voice such heresy.  And the war went forward with enthusiasm.    The king and his allies moved westward at the head of fifty thousand  men--knights in shining armor with their pennons streaming above their  helmets, pikemen in steel caps and brigandines, cross-bowmen in leather  jerkins. They crossed the border, took a frontier castle and burned  three mountain villages, and then, in the valley of the Valkia, ten  miles west of the boundary line, they met the hosts of Conan, king of  Aquilonia--forty-five thousand knights, archers and men-at-arms, the  flower of Aquilonian strength and chivalry. Only the knights of Poitain,  under Prospero, had not yet arrived, for they had far to ride up from  the southwestern corner of the kingdom. Tarascus had struck without  warning. His invasion had come on the heels of his proclamation, without  formal declaration of war.    The two hosts confronted each other across a wide, shallow valley, with  rugged cliffs, and a shallow stream winding through masses of reeds and  willows down the middle of the vale. The camp-followers of both hosts  came down to this stream for water, and shouted insults and hurled  stones across at one another. The last glints of the sun shone on the  golden banner of Nemedia with the scarlet dragon, unfurled in the breeze  above the pavilion of King Tarascus on an eminence near the eastern  cliffs. But the shadow of the western cliffs fell like a vast purple  pall across the tents and the army of Aquilonia, and upon the black  banner with its golden lion that floated above King Conan's pavilion.    All night the fires flared the length of the valley, and the wind  brought the call of trumpets, the clangor of arms, and the sharp  challenges of the sentries who paced their horses along either edge of  the willow-grown stream.           *       *       *       *       *    It was in the darkness before dawn that King Conan stirred on his couch,  which was no more than a pile of silks and furs thrown on a dais, and  awakened. He started up, crying out sharply and clutching at his sword.  Pallantides, his commander, rushing in at the cry, saw his king sitting  upright, his hand on his hilt, and perspiration dripping from his  strangely pale face.    'Your Majesty!' exclaimed Pallantides. 'Is aught amiss?'    'What of the camp?' demanded Conan. 'Are the guards out?'    'Five hundred horsemen patrol the stream, your Majesty,' answered the  general. 'The Nemedians have not offered to move against us in the  night. They wait for dawn, even as we.'    'By Crom,' muttered Conan. 'I awoke with a feeling that doom was  creeping on me in the night.'    He stared up at the great golden lamp which shed a soft glow over the  velvet hangings and carpets of the great tent. They were alone; not even  a slave or a page slept on the carpeted floor; but Conan's eyes blazed  as they were wont to blaze in the teeth of great peril, and the sword  quivered in his hand. Pallantides watched him uneasily. Conan seemed to  be listening.    'Listen!' hissed the king. 'Did you hear it? A furtive step!'    'Seven knights guard your tent, your Majesty,' said Pallantides. 'None  could approach it unchallenged.'    'Not outside,' growled Conan. 'It seemed to sound inside the tent.'    Pallantides cast a swift, startled look around. The velvet hangings  merged with shadows in the corners, but if there had been anyone in the  pavilion besides themselves, the general would have seen him. Again he  shook his head.    'There is no one here, sire. You sleep in the midst of your host.'    'I have seen death strike a king in the midst of thousands,' muttered  Conan. 'Something that walks on invisible feet and is not seen--'    'Perhaps you were dreaming, your Majesty,' said Pallantides, somewhat  perturbed.    'So I was,' grunted Conan. 'A devilish dream it was, too. I trod again  all the long, weary roads I traveled on my way to the kingship.'    He fell silent, and Pallantides stared at him unspeaking. The king was  an enigma to the general, as to most of his civilized subjects.  Pallantides knew that Conan had walked many strange roads in his wild,  eventful life, and had been many things before a twist of Fate set him  on the throne of Aquilonia.    'I saw again the battlefield whereon I was born,' said Conan, resting  his chin moodily on a massive fist. 'I saw myself in a pantherskin  loin-cloth, throwing my spear at the mountain beasts. I was a mercenary  swordsman again, a hetman of the _kozaki_ who dwell along the Zaporoska  River, a corsair looting the coasts of Kush, a pirate of the Barachan  Isles, a chief of the Himelian hillmen. All these things I've been, and  of all these things I dreamed; all the shapes that have been I passed  like an endless procession, and their feet beat out a dirge in the  sounding dust.    'But throughout my dreams moved strange, veiled figures and ghostly  shadows, and a faraway voice mocked me. And toward the last I seemed to  see myself lying on this dais in my tent, and a shape bent over me,  robed and hooded. I lay unable to move, and then the hood fell away and  a moldering skull grinned down at me. Then it was that I awoke.'    'This is an evil dream, your Majesty,' said Pallantides, suppressing a  shudder. 'But no more.'    Conan shook his head, more in doubt than in denial. He came of a  barbaric race, and the superstitions and instincts of his heritage  lurked close beneath the surface of his consciousness.    'I've dreamed many evil dreams,' he said, 'and most of them were  meaningless. But by Crom, this was not like most dreams! I wish this  battle were fought and won, for I've had a grisly premonition ever since  King Nimed died in the black plague. Why did it cease when he died?'    'Men say he sinned--'    'Men are fools, as always,' grunted Conan. 'If the plague struck all who  sinned, then by Crom there wouldn't be enough left to count the living!  Why should the gods--who the priests tell me are just--slay five hundred  peasants and merchants and nobles before they slew the king, if the  whole pestilence were aimed at him? Were the gods smiting blindly, like  swordsmen in a fog? By Mitra, if I aimed my strokes no straighter,  Aquilonia would have had a new king long ago.    'No! The black plague's no common pestilence. It lurks in Stygian  tombs, and is called forth into being only by wizards. I was a swordsman  in Prince Almuric's army that invaded Stygia, and of his thirty  thousand, fifteen thousand perished by Stygian arrows, and the rest by  the black plague that rolled on us like a wind out of the south. I was  the only man who lived.'    'Yet only five hundred died in Nemedia,' argued Pallantides.    'Whoever called it into being knew how to cut it short at will,'  answered Conan. 'So I know there was something planned and diabolical  about it. Someone called it forth, someone banished it when the work was  completed--when Tarascus was safe on the throne and being hailed as the  deliverer of the people from the wrath of the gods. By Crom, I sense a  black, subtle brain behind all this. What of this stranger who men say  gives counsel to Tarascus?'    'He wears a veil,' answered Pallantides; 'they say he is a foreigner; a  stranger from Stygia.'    'A stranger from Stygia!' repeated Conan scowling. 'A stranger from  hell, more like!--Ha! What is that?'    'The trumpets of the Nemedians!' exclaimed Pallantides. 'And hark, how  our own blare upon their heels! Dawn is breaking, and the captains are  marshaling the hosts for the onset! Mitra be with them, for many will  not see the sun go down behind the crags.'    'Send "]]]
