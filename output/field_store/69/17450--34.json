But, if the voice is held back by your palate, tongue, teeth, or lips,  _one_ kind of _consonant_ sounds is made. If the _breath_ is driven out  _without voice_, and is held back by these same parts of the mouth, the  _other_ kind of _consonant_ sounds is formed. Ex. of both: _b, d, g; p, t,  k_.    The teacher and pupils should practice on these sounds till the three kinds  can easily be distinguished.    You are now prepared to understand what I mean when I say that the +vowels+  are the +letters+ which stand for the +open sounds of the voice+, and that  the +consonants+ are the +letters+ which stand for the sounds made by the  +obstructed voice+ and the +obstructed breath+.    The teacher can here profitably spend a few minutes in showing how ideas  may be communicated by _Natural Language_, the language of _sighs, groans,  gestures_ of the hands, _attitudes_ of the body, _expressions_ of the face,  _tones_ of the voice, etc. He can show that, in conversation, we sometimes  couple this _Natural Language_ of _tone_ and _gesture_ with our language of  words, in order to make a stronger impression. Let the pupil be told that,  if the passage contain feeling, he should do the same in _Reading_ and  _Declaiming_.    Let the following definitions be learned, and given at the next recitation.    +DEFINITION.--Artificial Language, or _Language Proper_, consists of the  spoken and written words used to communicate ideas and thoughts+.    +DEFINITION.--_English Grammar_ is the science which teaches the forms,  uses, and relations of the words of the English Language+.          LESSON 3    Let the pupils be required to tell what they learned in the previous  lessons.    +Teacher+.--When I pronounce the two words _star_ and _bud_ thus: _star  bud_, how many ideas, or mental pictures, do I call up to you?    +Pupil+.--Two.    +T+.--Do you see any connection between these ideas?    +P+.--No.    +T+.--When I utter the two words _bud_ and _swelling_, thus: _bud  swelling_, do you see any connection in the ideas they stand for?    +P+.--Yes, I imagine that I see a bud expanding, or growing larger.    +T+.--I will connect two words more closely, so as to express a thought:  _Buds swell_. A thought has been formed in my mind when I say, _Buds  swell_; and these two words, in which something is said of something else,  express that thought, and make what we call a _sentence_. In the former  expression, _bud swelling_ it is assumed, or taken for granted, that buds  perform the act; in the latter, the swelling is asserted as a fact.    _Leaves falling_. Do these two words express two ideas merely associated,  or do they express a thought?    +P+.--They express ideas merely associated.    +T+.--_Leaves fall_.    Same question.    +P+.--A thought.    +T+.--Why?    +P+.--Because, in these words, there is something _said_ or _asserted_ of  leaves.    +T+.--When I say, _Falling leaves rustle_, does _falling_ tell what is  thought of leaves?    +P+.--No.    +T+.--What does _falling_ do?    +P+.--It tells the _kind_ of leaves you are thinking and speaking of.    +T+.--What word _does_ tell what is thought of leaves?    +P+.--_Rustle_.    +T+.--You see then that in the thought there are two parts; something of  which we think, and that which we think about it.    Let the pupils give other examples.          LESSON 4.    Commit to memory all definitions.    +DEFINITION.--A _Sentence_ is the expression of a thought in words+.    Which of the following expressions contain words that have _no connection_,  which contain words _merely associated_, and which are _sentences_?    1. Flowers bloom.  2. Ice melts.  3. Bloom ice.  4. Grass grows.  5. Brooks babble.  6. Babbling brooks.  7. Grass soar.  8. Doors open.  9. Open doors.  10. Cows graze.  11. Curling smoke.  12. Sugar graze.  13. Dew sparkles.  14. Hissing serpents.  15. Smoke curls.  16. Serpents hiss.  17. Smoke curling.  18. Serpents sparkles.  19. Melting babble.  20. Eagles soar.  21. Birds chirping.  22. Birds are chirping.  23. Birds chirp.  24. Gentle cows.  25. Eagles are soaring.  26. Bees ice.  27. Working bees.  28. Bees work.  29. Crawling serpents.  30. Landscape piano.  31. Serpents crawl.  32. Eagles clock.  33. Serpents crawling.          LESSON 5.    REVIEW QUESTIONS.    Illustrate, by the use of _a_, _b_, and _p_, the difference between the  _sounds_ of letters and their _names_. Letters are the signs of what? What  is an idea? A _spoken_ word is the sign of what? A _written_ word is the  sign of what? How do they differ? To what four different things did we call  attention in Lesson 1?    How are _vowel_ sounds made? How are the two kinds of _consonant_ sounds  made? What are vowels? Name them. What are consonants? What is artificial  language, or language proper? What do you understand by natural language?  What is English grammar?    What three kinds of expressions are spoken of in Lessons 3 and 4? Give  examples of each. What is a sentence?          LESSON 6.    ANALYSIS.    On the following sentences, let the pupils be exercised according to the  model.    +Model+.--_Intemperance degrades_. Why is this a _sentence?_ Ans.--Because  it expresses a thought. Of what is something thought? Ans.--Intemperance.  Which word tells what is thought? Ans.--_Degrades_.    1. Magnets attract.  2. Horses neigh.  3. Frogs leap.  4. Cold contracts.  5. Sunbeams dance.  6. Heat expands.  7. Sunlight gleams.  8. Banners wave.  9. Grass withers.  10. Sailors climb.  11. Rabbits burrow.  12. Spring advances.    You see that in these sentences there are two parts. The parts are the  _+Subject+_ and the _+Predicate+_.    +DEFINITION.--The _Subject of a sentence_ names that of which something is  thought+.    +DEFINITION.--The _Predicate of a sentence_ tells what is thought+.    +DEFINITION.--The _Analysis of a sentence_ is the separation of it into its  parts+.    Analyze, according to the model, the following sentences.    +Model+.--_Stars twinkle_. This is a _sentence_, because it expresses a  thought. _Stars_ is the _subject_, because it names that of which something  is thought; _twinkle_ is the _predicate_, because it tells what is thought.    +To the Teacher+.--After the pupils become familiar with the definitions,  the \"Models\" may be varied, and some of the reasons maybe made specific;  as, \"_Plants_ names the things we tell about; _droop_ tells what plants  do,\" etc.    Guard against needless repetition.    1. Plants droop.  2. Books help.  3. Clouds float.  4. Exercise strengthens.  5. Rain falls.  6. Time flies.  7. Rowdies fight.  8. Bread nourishes.  9. Boats capsize.  10. Water flows.  11. Students learn.  12. Horses gallop.          LESSON  7.    ANALYSIS AND THE DIAGRAM.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--I will draw on the board a heavy, or shaded,  line, and divide it into two parts, thus:               |  ===========|============             |    We will consider the first part as the sign of the _subject_ of a  sentence, and the second part as the sign of the _predicate_ of a  sentence.    Now, if I write a word over the first line, thus--(doing it)--you will  understand that that word is the subject of a sentence. If I write a word  over the second line, thus--you will understand that that word is the  predicate of a sentence.      Planets   |  revolve  ============|===========              |    The class can see by this picture that _Planets revolve_ is a sentence,  that _planets_ is the subject, and that _revolve_ is the predicate.    These signs, or illustrations, made up of straight lines, we call  +Diagrams+.    +DEFINITION.--A _Diagram_ is a picture of the offices and relations of the  different parts of a sentence+.    _Analyze_ and _diagram_ the following sentences.    1. Waves dash.  2. Kings reign.  3. Fruit ripens.  4. Stars shine.  5. Steel tarnishes.  6. Insects buzz.  7. Paul preached.  8. Poets sing.  9. Nero fiddled.  10. Larks sing.  11. Water ripples.  12. Lambs frisk.  13. Lions roar.  14. Tigers growl.  15. Breezes sigh.  16. Carthage fell.  17. Morning dawns.  18. Showers descended.  19. Diamonds sparkle.  20. Alexander conquered.  21. Jupiter thunders.  22. Columbus sailed,  23. Grammarians differ.  24. Cornwallis surrendered.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 8.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    You have now learned to analyze sentences, that is, to separate them into  their parts. You must next learn to put these parts together, that is, to  _build sentences_.    We will find one part, and you must find the other and do the building.    +To the Teacher+.--Let some of the pupils write their sentences on the  board, while others are reading theirs. Then let the work on the board be  corrected.    Correct any expression that does not make _good sense_, or that asserts  something not strictly true; for the pupil should early be taught to _think  accurately_, as well as to write and speak grammatically.    Correct all mistakes in _spelling_, and in the use of _capital letters_ and  the _period_.    Call attention to the agreement in form of the predicate with the subject.  See Notes, p. 163.    Insist on neatness. Collect the papers before the recitation closes.    +CAPITAL LETTER-RULE.--The first word of every sentence must begin with a  _capital letter_+.    +PERIOD--RULE.--A _period_ must be placed after every sentence that simply  affirms, denies, or expresses a command+.    Construct sentences by supplying a _subject_ to each of the following  _predicates_.    Ask yourself the question, What swim, sink, hunt, etc.?    1. ---- swim.  2. ---- sinks.  3. ---- hunt.  4. ---- skate.  5. ---- jingle.  6. ---- decay.  7. ---- climb.  8. ---- creep.  9. ---- run.  10. ---- walk.  11. ---- snort.  12. ---- kick.  13. ---- flashes.  14. ---- flutters.  15. ---- paddle.  16. ---- toil.  17. ---- terrifies.  18. ---- rages.  19. ---- expand.  20. ---- jump.  21. ---- hop.  22. ----"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7014"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#3)"],[1,"confessing it,  sometimes repeat popular opinions in scientific language. We hear of  subterranean gulfs and outlets in the New World, as on the shores of  the Caspian sea, though the lake of Tacarigua is two hundred and  twenty-two toises higher, and the Caspian sea fifty-four toises lower,  than the sea; and though it is well known, that fluids find the same  level, when they communicate by a lateral channel.    The changes which the destruction of forests, the clearing of plains,  and the cultivation of indigo, have produced within half a century in  the quantity of water flowing in on the one hand, and on the other the  evaporation of the soil, and the dryness of the atmosphere, present  causes sufficiently powerful to explain the progressive diminution of  the lake of Valencia. I cannot concur in the opinion of M. Depons*  (who visited these countries since I was there) \"that to set the mind  at rest, and for the honour of science,\" a subterranean issue must be  admitted. (* In his Voyage a la Terre Ferme M. Depons says, \"The small  extent of the surface of the lake renders impossible the supposition  that evaporation alone, however considerable within the tropics, could  remove as much water as the rivers furnish.\" In the sequel, the author  himself seems to abandon what he terms \"this occult case, the  hypothesis of an aperture.\") By felling the trees which cover the tops  and the sides of mountains, men in every climate prepare at once two  calamities for future generations; want of fuel and scarcity of water.  Trees, by the nature of their perspiration, and the radiation from  their leaves in a sky without clouds, surround themselves with an  atmosphere constantly cold and misty. They affect the copiousness of  springs, not, as was long believed, by a peculiar attraction for the  vapours diffused through the air, but because, by sheltering the soil  from the direct action of the sun, they diminish the evaporation of  water produced by rain. When forests are destroyed, as they are  everywhere in America by the European planters, with imprudent  precipitancy, the springs are entirely dried up, or become less  abundant. The beds of the rivers, remaining dry during a part of the  year, are converted into torrents whenever great rains fall on the  heights. As the sward and moss disappear with the brushwood from the  sides of the mountains, the waters falling in rain are no longer  impeded in their course; and instead of slowly augmenting the level of  the rivers by progressive filtrations, they furrow, during heavy  showers, the sides of the hills, bearing down the loosened soil, and  forming sudden and destructive inundations. Hence it results, that the  clearing of forests, the want of permanent springs, and the existence  of torrents, are three phenomena closely connected together. Countries  situated in opposite hemispheres, as, for example, Lombardy bordered  by the Alps, and Lower Peru inclosed between the Pacific and the  Cordillera of the Andes, afford striking proofs of the justness of  this assertion.    Till the middle of the last century, the mountains round the valleys  of Aragua were covered with forests. Great trees of the families of  mimosa, ceiba, and the fig-tree, shaded and spread coolness along the  banks of the lake. The plain, then thinly inhabited, was filled with  brushwood, interspersed with trunks of scattered trees and parasite  plants, enveloped with a thick sward, less capable of emitting radiant  caloric than the soil that is cultivated and consequently not  sheltered from the rays of the sun. With the destruction of the trees,  and the increase of the cultivation of sugar, indigo, and cotton, the  springs, and all the natural supplies of the lake of Valencia, have  diminished from year to year. It is difficult to form a just idea of  the enormous quantity of evaporation which takes place under the  torrid zone, in a valley surrounded with steep declivities, where a  regular breeze and descending currents of air are felt towards  evening, and the bottom of which is flat, and looks as if levelled by  the waters. It has been remarked, that the heat which prevails  throughout the year at Cura, Guacara, Nueva Valencia, and on the  borders of the lake, is the same as that felt at midsummer in Naples  and Sicily. The mean annual temperature of the valleys of Aragua is  nearly 25.5 degrees; my hygrometrical observations of the month of  February, taking the mean of day and night, gave 71.4 degrees of the  hair hygrometer. As the words great drought and great humidity have no  determinate signification, and air that would be called very dry in  the lower regions of the tropics would be regarded as humid in Europe,  we can judge of these relations between climates only by comparing  spots situated in the same zone. Now at Cumana, where it sometimes  does not rain during a whole year, and where I had the means of  collecting a great number of hygrometric observations made at  different hours of the day and night, the mean humidity of the air is  86 degrees; corresponding to the mean temperature of 27.7 degrees.  Taking into account the influence of the rainy months, that is to say,  estimating the difference observed in other parts of South America  between the mean humidity of the dry months and that of the whole  year; an annual mean humidity is obtained, for the valleys of Aragua,  at farthest of 74 degrees, the temperature being 25.5 degrees. In this  air, so hot, and at the same time so little humid, the quantity of  water evaporated is enormous. The theory of Dalton estimates, under  the conditions just stated, for the thickness of the sheet of water  evaporated in an hour's time, 0.36 mill., or 3.8 lines in twenty-four  hours. Assuming for the temperate zone, for instance at Paris, the  mean temperature to be 10.6 degrees, and the mean humidity 82 degrees,  we find, according to the same formulae, 0.10 mill., an hour, and 1  line for twenty-four hours. If we prefer substituting for the  uncertainty of these theoretical deductions the direct results of  observation, we may recollect that in Paris, and at Montmorency, the  mean annual evaporation was found by Sedileau and Cotte, to be from 32  in. 1 line to 38 in. 4 lines. Two able engineers in the south of  France, Messrs. Clausade and Pin, found, that in subtracting the  effects of filtrations, the waters of the canal of Languedoc, and the  basin of Saint Ferreol lose every year from 0.758 met. to 0.812 met.,  or from 336 to 360 lines. M. de Prony found nearly similar results in  the Pontine marshes. The whole of these experiments, made in the  latitudes of 41 and 49 degrees, and at 10.5 and 16 degrees of mean  temperature, indicate a mean evaporation of one line, or one and  three-tenths a day. In the torrid zone, in the West India Islands for  instance, the effect of evaporation is three times as much, according  to Le Gaux, and double according to Cassan. At Cumana, in a place  where the atmosphere is far more loaded with humidity than in the  valley of Aragua, I have often seen evaporate during twelve hours, in  the sun, 8.8 mill., in the shade 3.4 mill.; and I believe, that the  annual produce of evaporation in the rivers near Cumana is not less  than one hundred and thirty inches. Experiments of this kind are  extremely delicate, but what I have stated will suffice to demonstrate  how great must be the quantity of vapour that rises from the lake of  Valencia, and from the surrounding country, the waters of which flow  into the lake. I shall have occasion elsewhere to resume this subject;  for, in a work which displays the great laws of nature in different  zones, we must endeavour to solve the problem of the mean tension of  the vapours contained in the atmosphere in different latitudes, and at  different heights above the surface of the ocean.    A great number of local circumstances cause the produce of evaporation  to vary; it changes in proportion as more or less shade covers the  basin of the waters, with their state of motion or repose, with their  depth, and the nature and colour of their bottom; but in general  evaporation depends only on three circumstances, the temperature, the  tension of the vapours contained in the atmosphere, and the resistance  which the air, more or less dense, more or less agitated, opposes to  the diffusion of vapour. The quantity of water that evaporates in a  given spot, everything else being equal, is proportionate to the  difference between the quantity of vapour which the ambient air can  contain when saturated, and the quantity which it actually contains.  Hence it follows that the evaporation is not so great in the torrid  zone as might be expected from the enormous augmentation of  temperature; because, in those ardent climates, the air is habitually  very humid.    Since the increase of agricultural industry in the valleys of Aragua,  the little rivers which run into the lake of Valencia can no longer be  regarded as positive supplies during the six months succeeding  December. They remain dried up in the lower part of their course,  because the planters of indigo, coffee, and sugar-canes, have made  frequent drainings (azequias), in order to water the ground by  trenches. We may observe also, that a pretty considerable river, the  Rio Pao, which rises at the entrance of the Llanos, at the foot of the  range of hills called La Galera, heretofore mingled its waters with  those of the lake, by uniting with the Cano de Cambury, on the road  from the town of Nueva Valencia to Guigue. The course of this river  was from south to north. At the end of the seventeenth century, the  proprietor of a neighbouring plantation dug at the back of the hill a  new bed for the Rio Pao. He turned the river; and, after having  employed part of the water for the irrigation of his fields, he caused  the rest to flow at a venture southward, following the declivity of  the Llanos.
