If the first work of the  poor voters is to try to create a \"poor man's paradise,\" as poor men  are apt to fancy that Paradise, and as they are apt to think they can  create it, the great political trial now beginning will simply fail.  The wide gift of the elective franchise will be a great calamity to the  whole nation, and to those who gain it as great a calamity as to any.    I do not of course mean that statesmen can choose with absolute freedom  what topics they will deal with and what they will not. I am of course  aware that they choose under stringent conditions. In excited states of  the public mind they have scarcely a discretion at all; the tendency of  the public perturbation determines what shall and what shall not be  dealt with. But, upon the other hand, in quiet times statesmen have  great power; when there is no fire lighted, they can settle what fire  shall be lit. And as the new suffrage is happily to be tried in a quiet  time, the responsibility of our statesmen is great because their power  is great too.    And the mode in which the questions dealt with are discussed is almost  as important as the selection of these questions. It is for our  principal statesmen to lead the public, and not to let the public lead  them. No doubt when statesmen live by public favour, as ours do, this  is a hard saying, and it requires to be carefully limited. I do not  mean that our statesmen should assume a pedantic and doctrinaire tone  with the English people; if there is anything which English people  thoroughly detest, it is that tone exactly. And they are right in  detesting it; if a man cannot give guidance and communicate instruction  formally without telling his audience \"I am better than you; I have  studied this as you have not,\" then he is not fit for a guide or an  instructor. A statesman who should show that gaucherie would exhibit a  defect of imagination, and expose an incapacity for dealing with men  which would be a great hindrance to him in his calling. But much  argument is not required to guide the public, still less a formal  exposition of that argument. What is mostly needed is the manly  utterance of clear conclusions; if a statesman gives these in a  felicitous way (and if with a few light and humorous illustrations, so  much the better), he has done his part. He will have given the text,  the scribes in the newspapers will write the sermon. A statesman ought  to show his own nature, and talk in a palpable way what is to him  important truth. And so he will both guide and benefit the nation. But  if, especially at a time when great ignorance has an unusual power in  public affairs, he chooses to accept and reiterate the decisions of  that ignorance, he is only the hireling of the nation, and does little  save hurt it.    I shall be told that this is very obvious, and that everybody knows  that 2 and 2 make 4, and that there is no use in inculcating it. But I  answer that the lesson is not observed in fact; people do not so do  their political sums. Of all our political dangers, the greatest I  conceive is that they will neglect the lesson. In plain English, what I  fear is that both our political parties will bid for the support of the  working man; that both of them will promise to do as he likes if he  will only tell them what it is; that, as he now holds the casting vote  in our affairs, both parties will beg and pray him to give that vote to  them. I can conceive of nothing more corrupting or worse for a set of  poor ignorant people than that two combinations of well-taught and rich  men should constantly offer to defer to their decision, and compete for  the office of executing it. Vox populi will be Vox diaboli if it is  worked in that manner.    And, on the other hand, my imagination conjures up a contrary danger. I  can conceive that questions BEING raised which, if continually  agitated, would combine the working men as a class together, the higher  orders might have to consider whether they would concede the measure  that would settle such questions, or whether they would risk the effect  of the working men's combination.    No doubt the question cannot be easily discussed in the abstract; much  must depend on the nature of the measures in each particular case; on  the evil they would cause if conceded; on the attractiveness of their  idea to the working classes if refused. But in all cases it must be  remembered that a political combination of the lower classes, as such  and for their own objects, is an evil of the first magnitude; that a  permanent combination of them would make them (now that so many of them  have the suffrage) supreme in the country; and that their supremacy, in  the state they now are, means the supremacy of ignorance over  instruction and of numbers over knowledge. So long as they are not  taught to act together, there is a chance of this being averted, and it  can only be averted by the greatest wisdom and the greatest foresight  in the higher classes. They must avoid, not only every evil, but every  appearance of evil; while they have still the power they must remove,  not only every actual grievance, but, where it is possible, every  seeming grievance too; they must willingly concede every claim which  they can safely concede, in order that they may not have to concede  unwillingly some claim which would impair the safety of the country.    This advice, too, will be said to be obvious; but I have the greatest  fear that, when the time comes, it will be cast aside as timid and  cowardly. So strong are the combative propensities of man that he would  rather fight a losing battle than not fight at all. It is most  difficult to persuade people that by fighting they may strengthen the  enemy, yet that would be so here; since a losing battle--especially a  long and well-fought one--would have thoroughly taught the lower orders  to combine, and would have left the higher orders face to face with an  irritated, organised, and superior voting power. The courage which  strengthens an enemy and which so loses, not only the present battle,  but many after battles, is a heavy curse to men and nations.    In one minor respect, indeed, I think we may see with distinctness the  effect of the Reform Bill of 1867. I think it has completed one change  which the Act of 1832 began; it has completed the change which that Act  made in the relation of the House of Lords to the House of Commons. As  I have endeavoured in this book to explain, the literary theory of the  English Constitution is on this point quite wrong as usual. According  to that theory, the two Houses are two branches of the legislature,  perfectly equal and perfectly distinct. But before the Act of 1832 they  were not so distinct; there was a very large and a very strong common  element. By their commanding influence in many boroughs and counties  the Lords nominated a considerable part of the Commons; the majority of  the other part were the richer gentry--men in most respects like the  Lords, and sympathising with the Lords. Under the Constitution as it  then was the two Houses were not in their essence distinct; they were  in their essence similar; they were, in the main, not Houses of  contrasted origin, but Houses of like origin. The predominant part of  both was taken from the same class--from the English gentry, titled and  untitled. By the Act of 1832 this was much altered. The aristocracy and  the gentry lost their predominance in the House of Commons; that  predominance passed to the middle class. The two Houses then became  distinct, but then they ceased to be co-equal. The Duke of Wellington,  in a most remarkable paper, has explained what pains he took to induce  the Lords to submit to their new position, and to submit, time after  time, their will to the will of the Commons.    The Reform Act of 1867 has, I think, unmistakably completed the effect  which the Act of 1832 began, but left unfinished. The middle class  element has gained greatly by the second change, and the aristocratic  element has lost greatly. If you examine carefully the lists of  members, especially of the most prominent members, of either side of  the House, you will not find that they are in general aristocratic  names. Considering the power and position of the titled aristocracy,  you will perhaps be astonished at the small degree in which it  contributes to the active part of our governing assembly. The spirit of  our present House of Commons is plutocratic, not aristocratic; its most  prominent statesmen are not men of ancient descent or of great  hereditary estate; they are men mostly of substantial means, but they  are mostly, too, connected more or less closely with the new trading  wealth. The spirit of the two Assemblies has become far more contrasted  than it ever was.    The full effect of the Reform Act of 1832 was indeed postponed by the  cause which I mentioned just now. The statesmen who worked the system  which was put up had themselves been educated under the system which  was pulled down. Strangely enough, their predominant guidance lasted as  long as the system which they created. Lord Palmerston, Lord Russell,  Lord Derby, died or else lost their influence within a year or two of  1867. The complete consequences of the Act of 1832 upon the House of  Lords could not be seen while the Commons were subject to such  aristocratic guidance. Much of the change which might have been  expected from the Act of 1832 was held in suspense, and did not begin  till that measure had been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4352"],[0,"Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic (#3)"],[1,"acquainted with the  particular vice, in introducing us, the spectators, to such a degree of  intimacy with it, that in the end we get hold of some of the strings of  the marionette with which he is playing, and actually work them  ourselves; this it is that explains part of the pleasure we feel. Here,  too, it is really a kind of automatism that makes us laugh--an  automatism, as we have already remarked, closely akin to mere  absentmindedness. To realise this more fully, it need only be noted  that a comic character is generally comic in proportion to his  ignorance of himself. The comic person is unconscious. As though  wearing the ring of Gyges with reverse effect, he becomes invisible to  himself while remaining visible to all the world. A character in a  tragedy will make no change in his conduct because he will know how it  is judged by us; he may continue therein, even though fully conscious  of what he is and feeling keenly the horror he inspires in us. But a  defect that is ridiculous, as soon as it feels itself to be so,  endeavours to modify itself, or at least to appear as though it did.  Were Harpagon to see us laugh at his miserliness, I do not say that he  would get rid of it, but he would either show it less or show it  differently. Indeed, it is in this sense only that laughter \"corrects  men's manners.\" It makes us at once endeavour to appear what we ought  to be, what some day we shall perhaps end in being.    It is unnecessary to carry this analysis any further. From the runner  who falls to the simpleton who is hoaxed, from a state of being hoaxed  to one of absentmindedness, from absentmindedness to wild enthusiasm,  from wild enthusiasm to various distortions of character and will, we  have followed the line of progress along which the comic becomes more  and more deeply imbedded in the person, yet without ceasing, in its  subtler manifestations, to recall to us some trace of what we noticed  in its grosser forms, an effect of automatism and of inelasticity. Now  we can obtain a first glimpse--a distant one, it is true, and still  hazy and confused--of the laughable side of human nature and of the  ordinary function of laughter.    What life and society require of each of us is a constantly alert  attention that discerns the outlines of the present situation, together  with a certain elasticity of mind and body to enable us to adapt  ourselves in consequence. TENSION and ELASTICITY are two forces,  mutually complementary, which life brings into play. If these two  forces are lacking in the body to any considerable extent, we have  sickness and infirmity and accidents of every kind. If they are lacking  in the mind, we find every degree of mental deficiency, every variety  of insanity. Finally, if they are lacking in the character, we have  cases of the gravest inadaptability to social life, which are the  sources of misery and at times the causes of crime. Once these elements  of inferiority that affect the serious side of existence are  removed--and they tend to eliminate themselves in what has been called  the struggle for life--the person can live, and that in common with  other persons. But society asks for something more; it is not satisfied  with simply living, it insists on living well. What it now has to dread  is that each one of us, content with paying attention to what affects  the essentials of life, will, so far as the rest is concerned, give way  to the easy automatism of acquired habits. Another thing it must fear  is that the members of whom it is made up, instead of aiming after an  increasingly delicate adjustment of wills which will fit more and more  perfectly into one another, will confine themselves to respecting  simply the fundamental conditions of this adjustment: a cut-and-dried  agreement among the persons will not satisfy it, it insists on a  constant striving after reciprocal adaptation. Society will therefore  be suspicious of all INELASTICITY of character, of mind and even of  body, because it is the possible sign of a slumbering activity as well  as of an activity with separatist tendencies, that inclines to swerve  from the common centre round which society gravitates: in short,  because it is the sign of an eccentricity. And yet, society cannot  intervene at this stage by material repression, since it is not  affected in a material fashion. It is confronted with something that  makes it uneasy, but only as a symptom--scarcely a threat, at the very  most a gesture. A gesture, therefore, will be its reply. Laughter must  be something of this kind, a sort of SOCIAL GESTURE. By the fear which  it inspires, it restrains eccentricity, keeps constantly awake and in  mutual contact certain activities of a secondary order which might  retire into their shell and go to sleep, and, in short, softens down  whatever the surface of the social body may retain of mechanical  inelasticity. Laughter, then, does not belong to the province of  esthetics alone, since unconsciously (and even immorally in many  particular instances) it pursues a utilitarian aim of general  improvement. And yet there is something esthetic about it, since the  comic comes into being just when society and the individual, freed from  the worry of self-preservation, begin to regard themselves as works of  art. In a word, if a circle be drawn round those actions and  dispositions--implied in individual or social life--to which their  natural consequences bring their own penalties, there remains outside  this sphere of emotion and struggle--and within a neutral zone in which  man simply exposes himself to man's curiosity--a certain rigidity of  body, mind and character, that society would still like to get rid of  in order to obtain from its members the greatest possible degree of  elasticity and sociability. This rigidity is the comic, and laughter is  its corrective.    Still, we must not accept this formula as a definition of the comic. It  is suitable only for cases that are elementary, theoretical and  perfect, in which the comic is free from all adulteration. Nor do we  offer it, either, as an explanation. We prefer to make it, if you will,  the leitmotiv which is to accompany all our explanations. We must ever  keep it in mind, though without dwelling on it too much, somewhat as a  skilful fencer must think of the discontinuous movements of the lesson  whilst his body is given up to the continuity of the fencing-match. We  will now endeavour to reconstruct the sequence of comic forms, taking  up again the thread that leads from the horseplay of a clown up to the  most refined effects of comedy, following this thread in its often  unforeseen windings, halting at intervals to look around, and finally  getting back, if possible, to the point at which the thread is dangling  and where we shall perhaps find--since the comic oscillates between  life and art--the general relation that art bears to life.      III    Let us begin at the simplest point. What is a comic physiognomy? Where  does a ridiculous expression of the face come from? And what is, in  this case, the distinction between the comic and the ugly? Thus stated,  the question could scarcely be answered in any other than an arbitrary  fashion. Simple though it may appear, it is, even now, too subtle to  allow of a direct attack. We should have to begin with a definition of  ugliness, and then discover what addition the comic makes to it; now,  ugliness is not much easier to analyse than is beauty. However, we will  employ an artifice which will often stand us in good stead. We will  exaggerate the problem, so to speak, by magnifying the effect to the  point of making the cause visible. Suppose, then, we intensify ugliness  to the point of deformity, and study the transition from the deformed  to the ridiculous.    Now, certain deformities undoubtedly possess over others the sorry  privilege of causing some persons to laugh; some hunchbacks, for  instance, will excite laughter. Without at this point entering into  useless details, we will simply ask the reader to think of a number of  deformities, and then to divide them into two groups: on the one hand,  those which nature has directed towards the ridiculous; and on the  other, those which absolutely diverge from it. No doubt he will hit  upon the following law: A deformity that may become comic is a  deformity that a normally built person, could successfully imitate.    Is it not, then, the case that the hunchback suggests the appearance of  a person who holds himself badly? His back seems to have contracted an  ugly stoop. By a kind of physical obstinacy, by rigidity, in a word, it  persists in the habit it has contracted. Try to see with your eyes  alone. Avoid reflection, and above all, do not reason. Abandon all your  prepossessions; seek to recapture a fresh, direct and primitive  impression. The vision you will reacquire will be one of this kind. You  will have before you a man bent on cultivating a certain rigid  attitude--whose body, if one may use the expression, is one vast grin.    Now, let us go back to the point we wished to clear up. By toning down  a deformity that is laughable, we ought to obtain an ugliness that is  comic. A laughable expression of the face, then, is one that will make  us think of something rigid and, so to speak, coagulated, in the wonted  mobility of the face. What we shall see will be an ingrained twitching  or a fixed grimace. It may be objected that every habitual expression  of the face, even when graceful and beautiful, gives us this same  impression of something stereotyped? Here an important distinction must  be drawn. When we speak of expressive beauty or even expressive  ugliness, when we say that a face possesses expression, we mean  expression that may be stable, but which we conjecture to be mobile. It  maintains, in the midst of its fixity, a certain indecision in which  are obscurely portrayed all possible shades of the state of"]]]
