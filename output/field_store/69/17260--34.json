This check was photographed and was handed back to  Duval by some one of the French military or civil secret service  officials.    Almeyreda had hardly reached prison when he fell seriously ill and was  removed to the infirmary prison at Fresnes. There he died. The official  doctors first of all declared that he had been strangled, and then gave  it as their opinion that he had committed suicide.    Louis J. Malvy, who was at the time Under Secretary of the Interior, and  was Minister of the Interior under Ribot, will be tried by a  parliamentary court on the charge of having been in personal relations  with Duval and of having delivered to the Germans the scheme of the  abruptly ended French offensive in the Champagne in April, 1917.      THE CITY OF AMIENS.    Amiens, the old capital city of Picardy, goes far back into the military  history of Europe. Probably deriving its name from the Belgic tribe of  Ambiani, it was the centre of Julius Caesar's campaigns against those  warlike tribes. Several Roman Emperors had military headquarters there,  and it early gained importance as a bishopric. Evrard de Fouilloy, the  forty-fifth Bishop, began the great Gothic cathedral of Amiens, one of  the finest in the world, in the year 1220, the plans being made by Rene  de Luzarches, while the work was completed by Thomas de Cormont and his  son Renault in the year 1288, though the two great towers were not  finished until a century later. Because it is intersected by eleven  canals Louis XI. called Amiens \"the little Venice.\"    Only second to the great cathedral in fame is the Hotel de Ville, built  between 1660 and 1760, in which, on May 25, 1802, was signed the famous  treaty of Amiens, Napoleon's brother, Joseph Bonaparte, being  plenipotentiary for France. The parties to the Peace of Amiens were  France, England, Holland, and Spain. To Holland were restored the Cape  of Good Hope, Guiana, and other colonies; France received Martinique and  Guadeloupe; Spain received Minorca; Malta went to the Knights of Saint  John of Jerusalem, while Egypt was restored to Turkey. England was  secured in the control of India, and received Ceylon, (which had been  first Portuguese and later Dutch,) and the island of Trinidad. But many  of these dispositions were greatly modified thirteen years later, at the  close of the Napoleonic wars.    In Amiens there is a famous Napoleonic Museum, which has many fine  paintings by Puvis de Chavannes, including \"War,\" \"Peace,\" \"Work,\" and  \"Rest.\" When, on Nov. 28, 1876, Amiens was captured by the army of the  Prussians all religious monuments, including the cathedral, were  scrupulously guarded against any possible damage, and the rights of  private property were respected. Another of the titles of Amiens to fame  is the fact that Peter the Hermit, leader of the First Crusade, was born  there in 1050.      THE RUMANIAN NATION    Of the Emperor Hadrian's colony of Roman veterans at the mouth of the  Danube there remain many architectural monuments, including parts of two  fine bridges across the great river, a language largely Latin in  substance, and the name Romania. The Roman colony spread through the  Carpathians along the Roman road into Transylvania. It was in part  submerged by Hun and Magyar waves of invasion, and the western part of  the Rumanian people, west of the Carpathians, is still under Magyar  rule, while a small number of Rumanians inhabit the Austrian crownland  of Bukowina, once Rumanian soil. The Turks, following in the track of  the Huns and Magyars, once more swept over Rumania and on toward Vienna  and Russia, completely submerging the Balkan Peninsula, with the  exception of the Black Mountain, Montenegro, held by Serbs.    In the nineteenth century the Balkan nations began to extricate  themselves: Greece, with the aid of France, England, and Russia; Serbia,  with the aid of Russia; and the two principalities of Wallachia and  Moldavia, which were later to become Rumania. In the wars of Catherine  the Great and Suvoroff, which Byron has embodied in his comedy epic,  making Don Juan take part in the siege of Ismail, Russia took from  Turkey the Province of Bessarabia, named from an old Rumanian princely  house and largely populated by Rumanians.    The western half of Bessarabia was taken back from Russia and restored  to Turkey after the Crimean War, immediately after which, in 1861, the  two principalities were united in the single principality of Rumania,  under Colonel Cuza, a Rumanian, as Hospodar, or Lord, Turkish suzerainty  being acknowledged. In this way the strip of Bessarabia which had been  Russian for half a century became not Turkish, but Rumanian. When Russia  declared war against Turkey in 1877 she announced to Rumania that she  sought the restoration of her strip of Bessarabian land; and, knowing  this, Rumania became Russia's ally in the war against Turkey, with  Prince Carol as commander of her forces, he being of the Roman Catholic  branch of the Hohenzollerns. In 1881 he took the title of King, to which  his nephew Ferdinand succeeded in 1914.      THE HETMAN OF THE UKRAINE    Writing in 1818, Byron described Mazeppa as \"the Ukraine Hetman, calm  and bold,\" and it is to the period of Mazeppa and even earlier that this  title and office goes back. The word Hetman is of uncertain origin, but  is probably derived from the Bohemian Heitman, a modification of  Hauptmann or Headman. When the Ukraine, the \"borderland,\" was under  Polish suzerainty, in the period from 1592 to 1654, the epoch of \"Fire  and Sword,\" \"Pan Michael,\" and \"The Deluge,\" the Hetman of the  Cossacks, (a Tartar word, kazak, meaning warrior,) was a  semi-independent viceroy.    After the acceptance of Russian suzerainty by the Ukraine under the  great Hetman, Khmelnitski, in 1654, the title and authority of the  Hetman were at first continued, but his power and privileges were  gradually curtailed and finally abolished. It is not certain whether the  word Ataman is a modification of Hetman or a Tartar title; at any rate,  we find the title, \"Ataman of all the Cossacks,\" coming into use as an  appanage of the Czarevitch, or heir apparent of Russia, somewhat as the  title of Prince of Wales is an appanage of the heir apparent of England.  The Czarevitch was represented by Hetmans by delegation, for each  division of the Cossacks, these divisions being military colonies  westward as far as the Caspian, like that described by Tolstoy in his  novel, \"The Cossacks.\"    Writing in 1799, W. Tooke, in his \"View of the Russian Empire,\"  described the insignia of the Hetman as being the truncheon, the  national standard, the horsetail, kettledrums and signet, a group of  emblems strongly suggesting Tartar influence; the dress of the Cossacks  was, likewise, borrowed from that of the Caucasus Mohammedan tribes, and  in this Caucasian dress the new Hetman of the Ukraine, Skoropadski, took  office at Kiev. His name indicates that he is not a Ruthenian, (Little  Russian,) but a Pole. It has been a consistent element of Austrian  policy to favor the Poles at the expense of the Ruthenians, with the  result that many Poles are strongly pro-Austrian, and hold high office  under the Austrian crown.      PRECEDENTS FOR A SEPARATE ULSTER.    When the Dominion of Canada was formed by the British North America act  of 1867, it included only four provinces, Upper and Lower Canada,  (Ontario and Quebec,) Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Provision was made  in the act for the voluntary admission of Prince Edward's Island, the  Northwest Territories and Newfoundland into the Dominion. While the  Northwest Territories took advantage of this provision, and are now  organized as the Provinces of Manitoba, British Columbia, Alberta,  Saskatchewan, Yukon and the Northwest Territories, Newfoundland, with  Labrador, the latter 120,000 square miles in area, preferred to remain  outside the Dominion of Canada, and has a wholly distinct Constitution  and administration, as independent of Canada as is that, for example, of  British Guiana. Compulsion was never suggested to bring Newfoundland and  Labrador within the Dominion of Canada, though Labrador is  geographically a part of the Canadian mainland.    In Australia likewise the union of the colonies was entirely voluntary.  Five of these, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia,  and Tasmania, by legislative enactments, approved by the direct vote of  the electors, declared their desire for a federal union, and the  Imperial Parliament gave effect to this by the act of July 9, 1900. This  act provided for the inclusion of Western Australia in the Australian  Commonwealth, if that colony so desired; and Western Australia shortly  expressed and carried out that desire.    The population of Ulster in 1911 was 1,581,696, (that of Belfast being  386,947;) the population of Newfoundland with Labrador in 1914 was  251,726; the population of Western Australia when it exercised the  option of inclusion in the Commonwealth of Australia was 184,114; it has  since nearly doubled. A similar case of separate treatment, this time  within the United States, is that of West Virginia, which, in 1862,  determined to remain within the Union when the rest of Virginia seceded.  West Virginia became a State on Dec. 31, 1862, and was not re-integrated  in the Old Dominion at the close of the civil war.      COURT-MARTIAL IN ITALY.    Four principal Directors of the Genoese Electrical Power Company, named  Koenigsheim, Ampt, Martelli, and Hess, early in April were sentenced to  death by court-martial at Milan by being \"shot in the spine,\" and a  decoy girl was doomed to twenty "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41481"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science January 1930 (#3)"],[1,"gauge presented a still more startling sight,  for a glance showed that either there was a leak or else the oil had  frozen.    Tommy looked around at Dodd and pointed downward. Dodd responded with a  vicious forward wave of his hand.    Tommy shook his head, and Dodd started forward along the cabin,  apparently with the intention of committing assault and battery upon  him. Instead, the archaeologist collapsed upon the floor as the plane  spun completely around under the impact of a blast that was like a  giant's slap.    The plane was no longer controllable. True, she responded in some sort  to the controls, but all Tommy was able to do was to keep her from going  into a crazy sideslip or nose dive as he fought with the elements. And  those elements were like a devil unchained. One moment he was dropping  like a plummet, the next he was shooting up like a rocket as a vertical  blast of air caught the plane and tossed her like a cork into the  invisible heavens. Then she was revolving, as if in a maelstrom, and by  degrees this rotary movement began to predominate.    Round and round went the plane, in circles that gradually narrowed, and  it was all Tommy could do to swing the stick so as to keep her from  skidding or sideslipping. And as he worked desperately at his task Tommy  began to realize something that made him wonder if he was not dreaming.           *       *       *       *       *    The snow was no longer snow, but rain--mist, rather, warm mist that had  already cleared the windshield and covered it with tiny drops.    And that white, opaque world into which he was looking was no longer  snow but fog--the densest fog that Tommy had ever encountered.    Fog like white wool, drifting past him in fleecy flakes that looked as  if they had solid substance. Warm fog that was like balm upon his frozen  skin, but of a warmth that was impossible within a few miles of the  frozen pole.    Then there came a momentary break in it, and Tommy looked down and  uttered a cry of fear. Fear, because he knew that he must be dreaming.    Not more than a thousand feet beneath him he saw patches of snow, and  patches of--green grass, the brightest and most verdant green that he  had ever seen in his life.    He turned round at a touch on his shoulder. Dodd was leaning over him,  one hand pointing menacingly upward and onward.    \"You fool,\" Tommy bellowed in his ear, \"d'you think the south pole lies  over there? It's here! Yeah, don't you get it, Jimmy? Look down! This  valley--God, Jimmy, the south pole's a hole in the ground!\"    And as he spoke he remembered vaguely some crank who had once insisted  that the two poles were hollow because--what was the fellow's reasoning?  Tommy could not remember it.    But there was no longer any doubt but that they were dropping into a  hole. Not more than a mile around, which explained why neither Scott nor  Amundsen had found it when they approximated to the site of the pole. A  hole--a warm hole, up which a current of warm air was rushing, forming  the white mist that now gradually thinned as the plane descended. The  plateau with its covering of eternal snows loomed in a white circle high  overhead. Underneath was green grass now--grass and trees!           *       *       *       *       *    The fog was nearly gone. The plane responded to the controls again.  Tommy pushed the stick forward and came round in a tighter circle.    And then something happened that he had not in the least expected. One  moment he seemed to be traveling in a complete calm, a sort of clear  funnel with a ring of swirling fog outside it--the next he was dropping  into a void!    There was no air resistance--there seemed hardly any air, for he felt a  choking in his throat, and a tearing at his lungs as he strove to  breathe. He heard a strangled cry from Dodd, and saw that he was  clutching with both hands at his throat, and his face was turning  purple.    The controls went limp in Tommy's hands. The plane, gyrating more  slowly, suddenly nosed down, hung for a moment in that void, and then  plunged toward the green earth, two hundred feet below, with appalling  swiftness.    Tommy realized that a crash was inevitable. He threw his goggles up over  his forehead, turned and waved to Dodd in ironic farewell. He saw the  earth rush up at him--then came the shattering crash, and then oblivion!          CHAPTER II    _Beetles and Humans_      How long he had remained unconscious, Tommy had no means of determining.  Of a sudden he found himself lying on the ground beside the shattered  plane, with his eyes wide open.    He stared at it, and stared about him, without understanding where he  was, or what had happened to him. His first idea was that he had crashed  on the golf links near Mitchell Field, Long Island, for all about him  were stretches of verdant grass and small shrubby plants. Then, when he  remembered the expedition, he was convinced that he had been dreaming.    What brought him to a saner view was the discovery that he was enveloped  in furs which were insufferably hot. He half raised himself and  succeeded in unfastening his fur coat, and thus discovered that  apparently none of his bones was broken.    But the plane must have fallen from a considerable height to have been  smashed so badly. Then Tommy discovered that he was lying upon an  extensive mound of sand, thrown up as by some gigantic mole, for burrow  tracks ran through it in every direction. It was this that had saved his  life.    Something was moving at his side. It was half-submerged in the  sand-pile, and it was moving parallel to him with great rapidity.    A grayish body, half-covered with grains of sand emerged, waving two  enormously long tentacles. It was a shrimp, but fully three feet in  length, and Tommy had never before had any idea what an unpleasant  object a shrimp is.    Tommy staggered to his feet and dropped nearer the plane, eyeing the  shrimp with horror. But he was soon relieved as he discovered that it  was apparently harmless. It slithered away and once more buried itself  in the pile of sand.    Now Tommy was beginning to remember. He looked into the wreckage of the  plane. Jim Dodd was not there. He called his name repeatedly, and there  was no response, except a dull echo from the ice-mountains behind the  veil of fog.           *       *       *       *       *    He went to the other side of the plane, he scanned the ground all about  him. Jimmy had disappeared. It was evident that he was nowhere near, for  Tommy could see the whole of the lower scope of the bowl on every side  of him. He had walked away--or he had been carried away! Tommy thought  of the shrimp, and shuddered. What other fearsome monsters might inhabit  that extraordinary valley?    He sat down, leaning against the wreck of the fuselage, and tried to  adjust his mind, tried to keep himself from going mad. He knew now that  the flight had been no dream, that he was a member of his uncle's  expedition, that he had flown with Jim toward the pole, had crashed in a  vacuum. But where was Jim? And how were they going to get out of the  damn place?    Something like a heap of stones not far away attracted Tommy's  attention. Perhaps Jim Dodd was lying behind that. Once more Tommy got  upon his feet and began walking toward it. On the way, he stumbled  against the sharp edge of something that protruded from the ground.    It cut his leg sharply, and, with a curse, he began rubbing his shin and  looking at the thing. Then he saw that it was another of the fossil  shells, half-buried in the marshy ooze on which he was treading. The  ground in this lower part of the valley was a swamp, on account of the  very fine mist falling from the fog clouds that surrounded it  impenetrably on every side.    Then Tommy came upon another shell, and then another. And now he saw  that there were piles of what he had taken to be rock everywhere, and  that this was not rock but great heaps of the shells, all equally  intact.    Hundreds of thousands of the prehistoric beetles must have died in that  valley, perhaps overcome by some cataclysm.           *       *       *       *       *    Tommy examined the heap near which he stood; he yelled Dodd's name, but  again no answer came.    Instead, something began to stir among the heaps of shells. For a moment  Tommy hoped against hope that it was Dodd, but it wasn't Dodd.    _It was a living beetle!_    A beetle fully five feet high as it stood erect, a pair of enormous  wings outspread. And the head, which was larger than a man's, was the  most frightful object Tommy had ever seen.    Jim Dodd would have said at once that this was one of the Curculionidae,  or snout beetles, for a prolongation of the head between the eyes formed  a sort of beak a foot in length. The mouth, which opened downward, was  armed with terrific mandibles, while the huge, compound eyes looked like  enormous crystals of cut glass. Immediately in front of the eyes were  two mandibles as long as a man's arms, with feathery processes at the  ends. In addition to these there were three pairs of legs, the front  pair as long as a man's, the hind pair almost as long as a horse's.           *       *       *       *       *    Paralyzed with horror, Tommy watched the monster, which had apparently  been disturbed by the vibrations of his voice, extract itself from among  the shells. Then, with a bound that covered fifteen feet, it had  lessened the distance between them by half.    And then a still more amazing thing happened. For of a sudden the hard  shell slipped from the thorax, the wing-cases dropped off, the whole of  the bony parts slipped to the ground with a clang, and a soft,  defenseless thing went slithering away among the rocks.    The beetle had moulted!    Tommy dropped to the ground in the throes of violent nausea.    Then, looking up again, he saw the girl!           *       *       *       *       *    She was"]]]
