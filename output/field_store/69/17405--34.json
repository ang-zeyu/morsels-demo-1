[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60235"],[0,"The Seventy's Course in Theology, First Year (#3)"],[1," the main, of  the class our Seventies would do well to read. The Era has been the  vehicle through which very many important doctrinal articles have been  published; and having become the organ of the Seventies, as well as of  the Young Men's association, is a guarantee that it will continue that  line of work, and perhaps more abundantly in the future than in the  past. There will be a Seventies' department opened in the magazine, of  several pages, in which will be published each month suggestions and  directions relative to Seventies' class work, quorum discipline and  general management. Of the advantages of such an arrangement little  need be urged since they must be obvious to all. Hereafter, then, the  Improvement Era will be known as the \"ORGAN OF THE SEVENTIES AND THE  YOUNG MEN'S MUTUAL IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS.\"    The First Council bespeak for our organ the hearty support of all the  Seventies. Its success has depended heretofore on the love and loyalty  of the Young Men's Association; hereafter that will be supplemented by  the love and loyalty of the Seventies' quorums. The attention of the  members of the quorums should at once be called to this new adjunct in  our work and they be invited to become subscribers to our magazine. We  suggest that one or two members in each quorum be appointed to solicit  subscriptions within the quorum, that each member be given the direct  opportunity to become a subscriber. The Era, it will be understood, has  no other agents except those appointed by the Young Men's Association  in the respective wards and branches of the Church, and now, of course,  those who will be appointed by our quorums. The service is to be given  without remuneration--soliciting subscriptions within our quorums is to  be a work of love and interest. The price is two dollars per year, paid  in advance, and subscriptions should be sent by the quorum agent to the  manager of the Era, Elder Alpha J. Higgs, Era office, 214 Templeton  Building, Salt Lake City. Promptness and efficiency in dealing with  this matter is expected.    It is a fortunate circumstance that this inauguration of better working  conditions for the quorums of Seventies, and the beginning of the  volume of the Era--volume XI--should start off together, viz., in the  month of November. But is it not a co-ordination of circumstances  brought about by the operation of the Spirit of the Lord upon the minds  of the brethren rather than a matter of good fortune? So many things  have conjoined for this new movement among the Seventies to augur  success that those of us who have been watching its development cannot  doubt but that                              _\"God Wills It!\"_    _CONCLUSION_.    And now, brethren of the Seventies, in conclusion: Be earnest in this  work. Be thorough, patient, self-denying. A great opportunity has come  to us--let us make the most of it, and be grateful that it has come.  Let no difficulties appall us. We can overcome them. Let us say of  difficulties, what Napoleon said of the Alps, when the difficulty, if  not the impossibility, of crossing them with an army was suggested, he  answered:                          \"There Shall Be No Alps!\"_    REMEMBER! _To become a Seventy means mental activity, intellectual  development, and the attainment of spiritual power_.    _A SUGGESTED LIST OF BOOKS OF REFERENCE_.    The following named books of reference will be especially useful in  the present year's course of study. It is not expected, of course,  that all our Seventies will be able to secure the entire collection  suggested, but it would be well for our members to purchase so many of  them as they can afford to buy as the beginning of a small personal  library. The books recommended will not only be useful for the present  year's lessons, but are standard books that will be useful in all the  courses of study yet to be prescribed. Inasmuch as individuals may not  be able to purchase these books, we suggest that it would be well for  each quorum to take under consideration the propriety of the quorum  as a body obtaining this complete list as the foundation of a quorum  reference library, that might be available to all for preparation.    1. _\"The Seventy's Indispensible Library:\"_ This consists of the  Cambridge Bible, the Book of Mormon, The Doctrine and Covenants,  Pearl of Great Price, (bound in one volume) and the Richards-Little  Compendium; price, post-paid, $9.00.    _Webster's New Standard Dictionary of the English Language_, adapted  for High School, Academic and Collegiate Courses; price, $1.50.    _The Works of Flavius-Josephus,_ in one volume, by William Whiston, A.  M., David McKay, Publisher, 23 South Ninth Street, Philadelphia, $1.50.    _Dictionary of the Bible_ (Dr. William Smith's). The most desirable  edition of this work is the four volume edition of Prof. H. B. Hackett,  D. D., published by Houghton-Mifflin & Co., Boston. It is a very  valuable work and contains, \"by universal consent, the fruit of the  ripest biblical scholarship of England, and constitutes a library of  itself, superceding the use of many books otherwise necessary.\" The  price in leather binding, $25.00. The Seventies individually may not be  able to purchase this edition, but where quorums unite for the purchase  of books this is the edition that should be secured.    There is, however, a one volume edition of this work, known as    _Smith's Smaller Dictionary of the Bible,_ published by Fleming H.  Revell Co., New York and Chicago, $1.25, post-paid.    _Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature,_ edited by John Kitto, two  volumes, S. W. Green's Son, Publishers, 74, 76 Beekmen St., New York.  If Smith's Dictionary is not secured then the work next in value is the  one here named.    _\"A Commentary Critical and Explanatory of the Old and New Testament,\"_  Jamieson-Fausset-Brown, S. S. Scranton & Co., Hartford, Publishers.  This is a very excellent work, and frequently quoted in the references  and also in the notes of the present year's course of study. As  remarked in one of the notes, the Elders who make up our ministry  may not accept the doctrinal interpretation of this or any other  commentary, yet its historical and critical treatises are among the  most recent and valuable.    _The Old Testament History,_ by William Smith, Harper & Brothers,  Publishers, New York; price, $2.00. This work is designed by the  compiler and editor as a manual in relation to Hebrew history and on a  par with the histories of Greece and Rome, generally used in our best  schools. As a digest of Biblical History, it is a most valuable work.    _Dr. Smith's New Testament History,_ with introduction, connecting the  history of the Old Testament with the New, Harper Brothers, New York.  This work stands in the same relationship to the New Testament History  that the previously mentioned work does to the Old.    _\"Illustrated Bible Treasury,\"_ edited by William Wright, D. D. To  those who may have neither Cambridge or Oxford or Nelson Bible Helps,  we recommend this as a very valuable collection of material, including  a Concordance, a Dictionary and Maps, and upwards of 350 illustrations,  on Bible subjects; price, post-paid, seventy-five cents.    As helps in the study of the Book of Mormon we recommend:    _Reynolds' Dictionary of the Book of Mormon._    _Y. M. M. I. A. Manuals, Nos. 7, 8 and 9,_ containing Elder Roberts'  treatise on the Book of Mormon, including a consideration of External  and Internal Evidences, price twenty-five cents per number.    _Defense of the Faith and the Saints_ (just out from the press), price  $1.50.    _Y. M. M. I. A. Manual, No. 10;_ subject, Modern Revelation, especially  valuable in the study of the Doctrine and Covenants; price twenty-five  cents. Manuals can be obtained from the Era office, Templeton Building,  Salt Lake City.    _The Book of Abraham._ Its Authenticity as a Divine and Ancient Record,  (Elder George Reynolds).    _The Improvement Era, organ of the Seventies and Y. M. M. I.  Associations,_ for current literature, comment and special articles  on subjects of first year's Seventies' work, price $2.00 per year, in  advance.        _The Seventy's Course in Theology._    __FIRST YEAR_._        _PART I._    _Outline History of the Seventy._        LESSON I.    _THE SEVENTY IN THREE DISPENSATIONS._      ANALYSIS.

A heavily sleeping  person is often so sodden in slumber that his senses of smell and  hearing are temporarily dead; and many a sleeping man has been  asphyxiated by gas or smoke, or burned to death, because his  deadened senses failed to arouse him at the critical moment. (This  dangerous condition of mind can be cured by efforts of the will,  exercised prior to sleep, through a determination resolutely to  arouse and investigate every unusual sensation that registers  \"danger\" on any one of the senses.) The normal individual sleeps  with a subconscious and sensitive mind, from which thought and  reason have not been entirely eliminated.    Every act of a man or animal, vertebrate or invertebrate, is based  upon either _reason_ or _hereditary instinct._ It is a  mistake to assume that because an organism is small it  necessarily has no \"mind,\" and none of the propelling impulse that  we call thought. The largest whale may have less intelligence and  constructive reasoning than a trap-door spider, a bee or an ant.  To deny this is to deny the evidence of one's senses.    A MEASURE FOR ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE. The intelligence of an animal  may be estimated by taking into account, separately, its mental  qualities, about as follows:    1. General knowledge of surrounding conditions.  2. Powers of independent observation and reasoning.  3. Memory.  4. Comprehension under tuition.  5. Accuracy in the execution of man's orders.    Closely allied to these are the _moral qualities_ which go to  make up an animal's temperament and disposition, about as follows:    1. Amiability, which guarantees security to its associates.  2. Patience, or submission to discipline and training.  3. Courage, which gives self-confidence and steadiness.  4. A disposition to obedience, with cheerfulness.    All normal vertebrate animals exercise their intelligence in  accordance with their own rules of logic. Had they not been able  to do so, it is reasonable to suppose that they could never have  developed into vertebrates, reaching even up to man himself.    According to the laws of logic, this proposition is no more open  to doubt or dispute than is the existence of the Grand Canyon of  the Colorado. But few persons have seen the Canyon, and far fewer  ever have proven its existence by descending to its bottom; but  none the less Reason admonishes all of us that the great chasm  exists, and is not a debatable question.    To men and women who really know the vertebrate animals by contact  with some of them upon their own levels, the reasoning power of  the latter is not a debatable question. The only real question is:  how far does their intelligence carry them? It is with puzzled  surprise that we have noted the curious diligence of the  professors of animal psychology in always writing of \"animal  _behavior_,\" and never of old-fashioned, common-sense  _animal intelligence_. Can it be possible that any one of  them really refuses to concede to the wild animal the possession  of a mind, and a working intelligence?    Yes. Animals do reason. If any one truth has come out of all the  critical or uncritical study of the animal mind that has been  going on for two centuries, it is this. Animals do reason; they  always have reasoned, and as long as animals live they never will  cease to reason.    The higher wild animals possess and display the same fundamental  passions and emotions that animate the human race. This fact is  subject to intelligent analysis, discussion and development, but  it is not by any means a \"question\" subject to debate. In the most  intellectual of the quadrupeds, birds and reptiles, the display of  fear, courage, love, hate, pleasure, displeasure, confidence,  suspicion, jealousy, pity, greed and generosity are so plainly  evident that even children can and do recognize them. To the  serious and open-minded student who devotes prolonged thought to  these things, they bring the wild animal very near to the \"lord of  creation.\"    To the question, \"Have wild animals souls?\" we reply, \"That is a  debatable question. Read; then think it over.\"    METHODS WITH THE ANIMAL MIND. In the study of animal minds, much  depends upon the method employed. It seems to me that the problem-  box method of the investigators of \"animal behavior\" leaves much  to be desired. Certainly it is not calculated to develop the  mental status of animals along lines of natural mental  progression. To place a wild creature in a great artificial  contrivance, fitted with doors, cords, levers, passages and what  not, is enough to daze or frighten any timid animal out of its  normal state of mind and nerves. To put a wild sapajou monkey,--  weak, timid and afraid,--in a strange and formidable prison box  filled with strange machinery, and call upon it to learn or to  invent strange mechanical processes, is like bringing a boy of ten  years up to a four-cylinder duplex Hoe printing-and-folding press,  and saying to him: \"Now, go ahead and find out how to run this  machine, and print both sides of a signature upon it.\"    The average boy would shrink from the mechanical monster, and have  no stomach whatever for \"trial by error.\"    I think that the principle of determining the mind of a wild  animal _along the lines of the professor_ is not the best  way. It should be developed _along the natural lines of the  wild-animal mind._ It should be stimulated to do what it feels  most inclined to do, and educated to achieve real mental progress.    I think that the ideal way to study the minds of apes, baboons and  monkeys would be to choose a good location in a tropical or sub-  tropical climate that is neither too wet nor too dry, enclose an  area of five acres with an unclimbable fence, and divide it into  as many corrals as there are species to be experimented upon. Each  corral would need a shelter house and indoor playroom. The stage  properties should be varied and abundant, and designed to  stimulate curiosity as well as activity.    Somewhere in the program I would try to teach orang-utans and  chimpanzees the properties of fire, and how to make and tend  fires. I would try to teach them the seed-planting idea, and the  meaning of seedtime and harvest. I would teach sanitation and  cleanliness of habit,--a thing much more easily done than most  persons suppose. I would teach my apes to wash dishes and to cook,  and I am sure that some of them would do no worse than some human  members of the profession who now receive $50 per month, or more,  for spoiling food.    In one corral I would mix up a chimpanzee, an orang-utan, a golden  baboon and a good-tempered rhesus monkey. My apes would begin at  two years old, because after seven or eight years of age all apes  are difficult, or even impossible, as subjects for peaceful  experimentation.    I would try to teach a chimpanzee the difference between a noise  and music, between heat and cold, between good food and bad food.  Any trainer can teach an animal the difference between the  blessings of peace and the horrors of war, or in other words,  obedience and good temper versus cussedness and punishment.    Dr. Yerkes' laboratory in Montecito, California, and his  experiments there with an orang-utan and other primates, were in a  good place, and made a good beginning. It is very much to be hoped  that means will be provided by which his work can be prosecuted  indefinitely, and under the most perfect conditions that money can  provide.    I hope that I will live long enough to see Dr. Yerkes develop the  mind of a young grizzly bear in a four-acre lot, to the utmost  limits of that keen and sagacious personality.          II    WILD ANIMAL TEMPERAMENT AND INDIVIDUALITY      In man and in vertebrate animals generally, temperament is the  foundation of intelligence and progress. Fifty years ago Fowler  and Wells, the founders of the science of phrenology and  physiognomy, very wisely differentiated and defined four  \"temperaments\" of mankind. The six types now recognized by me are  the _morose, lymphatic, sanguine, nervous, hysterical_ and  _combative_; and their names adequately describe them.    This classification applies to the higher wild animals, quite as  truly as to men. By the manager of wild animals in captivity,  wild-animal temperament universally is recognized and treated as a  factor of great practical importance. Mistakes in judging the  temper of dangerous animals easily lead to tragedies and sudden  death.    Fundamentally the temperament of a man or an animal is an  inheritance from ancestors near or remote. In the human species a  morose or hysterical temperament may possibly be corrected or  improved, by education and effort. With animals this is rarely  possible. The morose gorilla gives way to cheerfulness only when  it is placed in ideally pleasant and stimulating social  conditions. This, however, very seldom is possible. The nervous  deer, bear or monkey is usually nervous to the end of its days.    The morose and hysterical temperaments operate against mental  development, progress and happiness. In the human species among  individuals of equal mental calibre, the sanguine individual is  due to rise higher and go farther than his nervous or lymphatic  rivals. A characteristic temperament may embrace the majority of  a whole species, or be limited to a few individuals. Many species  are permanently characterized by the temperament common to the  majority of their individual members. Thus, among the great apes  the gorilla species is either morose or lymphatic; and it is  manifested by persistent inactivity and sullenness. This leads to  loss of appetite, indigestion, inactivity and early death. Major  Penny's \"John Gorilla\" was a notable exception, as will appear in  Chapter IX.    The orang-utan is sanguine, optimistic and cheerful, a good  boarder, affectionate toward his keepers, and friendly toward  strangers. He eats well,"]]]
