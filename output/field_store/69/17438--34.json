He  entered several large tracts of fertile land, and returning to  Virginia disposed of his property there, and with his wife and five  children went back to Kentucky and settled in Jefferson County. Little  is known of this pioneer Lincoln or of his father. Most of the records  belonging to that branch of the family were destroyed in the civil  war. Their early orphanage, the wild and illiterate life they led on  the frontier, severed their connection with their kindred in the East.  This, often happened; there are hundreds of families in the West  bearing historic names and probably descended from well-known houses  in the older States or in England, which, by passing through one or  two generations of ancestors who could not read or write, have lost  their continuity with the past as effectually as if a deluge had  intervened between the last century and this. Even the patronymic has  been frequently distorted beyond recognition by slovenly pronunciation  during the years when letters were a lost art, and by the phonetic  spelling of the first boy in the family who learned the use of the  pen. There are Lincolns in Kentucky and Tennessee belonging to the  same stock with the President, whose names are spelled \"Linkhorn\" and  \"Linkhern.\" All that was known of the emigrant, Abraham Lincoln, by  his immediate descendants was that his progenitors, who were Quakers,  came from Berks County, Pennsylvania, into Virginia, and there throve  and prospered. [Footnote: We desire to express our obligations to  Edwin Salter, Samuel L. Smedley, Samuel Shackford, Samuel W.  Pennypacker, Howard M. Jenkins, and John T. Harris, Jr., for  information and suggestions which have been of use to us in this  chapter.] But we now know, with sufficient clearness, through the  wide-spread and searching luster which surrounds the name, the history  of the migrations of the family since its arrival on this continent,  and the circumstances under which the Virginia pioneer started for  Kentucky.    The first ancestor of the line of whom we have knowledge was Samuel  Lincoln, of Norwich, England, who came to Hingham, Massachusetts, in  1638, and died there. He left a son, Mordecai, whose son, of the same  name,--and it is a name which persists in every branch of the family,  [Footnote: The Lincolns, in naming their children, followed so strict  a tradition that great confusion has arisen in the attempt to trace  their genealogy. For instance, Abraham Lincoln, of Chester County, son  of one Mordecai and brother of another, the President's ancestors,  left a fair estate, by will, to his children, whose names were John,  Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Mordecai, Rebecca, and Sarah--precisely the  same names we find in three collateral families.]--removed to  Monmouth, New Jersey, and thence to Amity township, now a part of now  a part of Berks County, Pennsylvania, where he died in 1735, fifty  years old. From a copy of his will, recorded in the office of the  Register in Philadelphia, we gather that he was a man of considerable  property. In the inventory of his effects, made after his death, he is  styled by the appraisers, \"Mordecai Lincoln, Gentleman.\" His son John  received by his father's will \"a certain piece of land lying in the  Jerseys, containing three hundred acres,\" the other sons and daughters  having been liberally provided for from the Pennsylvania property.  This John Lincoln left New Jersey some years later, and about 1750  established himself in Rockingham County, Virginia. He had five sons,  to whom he gave the names which were traditional in the family:--  Abraham, the pioneer first mentioned,--Isaac, Jacob, Thomas, and John.  Jacob and John remained in Virginia; the former was a soldier in the  War of the Revolution, and took part as lieutenant in a Virginia  regiment at the siege of Yorktown. Isaac went to a place on the  Holston River in Tennessee; Thomas followed his brother to Kentucky,  lived and died there, and his children then emigrated to Tennessee  [Footnote: It is an interesting coincidence for the knowledge of which  we are indebted to Colonel John B. Brownlow, that a minister named  Mordecai Lincoln a relative of the President, performed, on the 17th  of May, 1837, the marriage ceremony of Andrew Johnson, Mr. Lincoln's  succesor, in the Presidency.] With the one memorable exception the  family seem to have been modest, thrifty, unambitious people. Even the  great fame and conspicuousness of the President did not tempt them out  of their retirement. Robert Lincoln, of Hancock County, Illinois, a  cousin--German, became a captain and commissary of volunteers; none of  the others, so far as we know, ever made their existence known to  their powerful kinsman during the years of his glory. [Transcriber's  Note: Lengthy footnote relocated to chapter end.]    It was many years after the death of the President that his son  learned the probable circumstances under which the pioneer Lincoln  removed to the West, and the intimate relations which subsisted  between his family and the most celebrated man in early Western  annals. There is little doubt that it was on account of his  association with the, famous Daniel Boone that Abraham Lincoln went to  Kentucky. The families had for a century been closely allied. There  were frequent intermarriages [Footnote: A letter from David J.  Lincoln, of Birdsboro, Berks County, Pennsylvania, to the writers,  says, \"My grandfather, Abraham Lincoln, was married to Anna Boone, a  first cousin of Daniel Boone, July 10, 1760.\" He was half-brother of  John Lincoln, and afterwards became a man of some prominence in  Pennsylvania, serving in the Constitutional Convention in 1789-90.]  among them--both being of Quaker lineage. By the will of Mordecai  Lincoln, to which reference has been made, his \"loving friend and  neighbor\" George Boone was made a trustee to assist his widow in the  care of the property. Squire Boone, the father of Daniel, was one of  the appraisers who made the inventory of Mordecai Lincoln's estate.  The intercourse between the families was kept up after the Boones had  removed to North Carolina and John Lincoln had gone to Virginia.  Abraham Lincoln, son of John, and grandfather of the President, was  married to Miss Mary Shipley [Transcriber's Note: Lengthy footnote  relocated to chapter end.] in North Carolina. The inducement which led  him to leave Virginia, where his standing and his fortune were  assured, was, in all probability, his intimate family relations with  the great explorer, the hero of the new country of Kentucky, the land  of fabulous richness and unlimited adventure. At a time when the  Eastern States were ringing with the fame of the mighty hunter who was  then in the prime of his manhood, and in the midst of those  achievements which will forever render him one of the most picturesque  heroes in all our annals, it is not to be wondered at that his own  circle of friends should have caught the general enthusiasm and felt  the desire to emulate his career.    Boone's exploration of Kentucky had begun some ten years before  Lincoln set out to follow his trail. In 1769 he made his memorable  journey to that virgin wilderness of whose beauty he always loved to  speak even to his latest breath. During all that year he hunted,  finding everywhere abundance of game. \"The buffalo,\" Boone says, \"were  more frequent than I have seen cattle in the settlements, browsing on  the leaves of the cane, or cropping the herbage on these extensive  plains, fearless because ignorant of the violence of man. Sometimes we  saw hundreds in a drove, and the numbers about the salt springs were  amazing.\" In the course of the winter, however, he was captured by the  Indians while hunting with a comrade, and when they had contrived to  escape they never found again any trace of the rest of their party.  But a few days later they saw two men approaching and hailed them with  the hunter's caution, \"Hullo, strangers; who are you?\" They replied,  \"White men and friends.\" They proved to be Squire Boone and another  adventurer from North Carolina. The younger Boone had made that long  pilgrimage through the trackless woods, led by an instinct of doglike  affection, to find his elder brother and share his sylvan pleasures  and dangers. Their two companions were soon waylaid and killed, and  the Boones spent their long winter in that mighty solitude  undisturbed. In the spring their ammunition, which was to them the  only necessary of life, ran low, and one of them must return to the  settlements to replenish the stock. It need not be said which assumed  this duty; the cadet went uncomplaining on his way, and Daniel spent  three months in absolute loneliness, as he himself expressed it, \"by  myself, without bread, salt, or sugar, without company of my fellow-  creatures, or even a horse or dog.\" He was not insensible to the  dangers of his situation. He never approached his camp without the  utmost precaution, and always slept in the cane-brakes if the signs  were unfavorable. But he makes in his memoirs this curious reflection,  which would seem like affectation in one less perfectly and simply  heroic: \"How unhappy such a situation for a man tormented with fear,  which is vain if no danger comes, and if it does, only augments the  pain. It was my happiness to be destitute of this afflicting passion,  with which I had the greatest reason to be afflicted.\" After his  brother's return, for a year longer they hunted in those lovely wilds,  and then returned to the Yadkin to bring their families to the new  domain. They made the long journey back, five hundred miles, in peace  and safety.    For some time after this Boone took no conspicuous part in the  settlement of Kentucky. The expedition with which he left the Yadkin  in 1773 met with a terrible disaster"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6818"],[0,"The Arctic Prairies : a Canoe-Journey of 2,000 Miles in Search of the Caribou; (#3)"],[1,"friend had given me a pint flask of pure brandy--\"for  emergencies.\" An emergency had come.    \"John! you shall have some extra fine brandy, nicely thinned with  pepper-juice.\" I poured half an inch of brandy into a tin cup, then  added half an inch of \"pain-killer.\"    \"Here, take this, and if you don't feel it, it means your insides  are dead, and you may as well order your coffin.\"    John took it at a gulp. His insides were not dead; but I might have  been, had I been one of his boatmen.    He doubled up, rolled around, and danced for five minutes. He did  not squeal--John never squeals--but he suffered some, and an hour  later announced that he was about cured.    Next day he came to say he was all right, and would soon again be  as good as half a dozen men.    At this same camp in Grand Rapids another cure on a much larger  scale was added to my list. An Indian had \"the bones of his foot  broken,\" crushed by a heavy weight, and was badly crippled. He  came leaning on a friend's shoulder. His foot was blackened and much  swollen, but I soon satisfied myself that no bones were broken,  because he could wriggle all the toes and move the foot in any  direction.    \"You'll be better in three days and all right in a week,\" I said,  with calm assurance. Then I began with massage. It seemed necessary  in the Indian environment to hum some tune, and I found that the  \"Koochy-Koochy\" lent itself best to the motion, so it became my  medicine song.    With many \"Koochy-Koochy\"-ings and much ice-cold water he was  nearly cured in three days, and sound again in a week. But in the  north folk have a habit (not known elsewhere) of improving the  incident. Very soon it was known all along the river that the Indian's  leg was broken, and I had set and healed it in three days. In a  year or two, I doubt not, it will be his neck that was broken, not  once, but in several places.    Grand Island yielded a great many Deermice of the arctic form, a  few Red-backed Voles, and any number of small birds migrant.    As we floated down the river the eye was continually held by tall  and prominent spruce trees that had been cut into peculiar forms  as below. These were known as \"lob-sticks,\" or \"lop-sticks,\" and  are usually the monuments of some distinguished visitor in the  country or records of some heroic achievement. Thus, one would be  pointed out as Commissioner Wrigley's lob-stick, another as John  MacDonald's the time he saved the scow.    The inauguration of a lob-stick is quite a ceremony. Some person  in camp has impressed all with his importance or other claim to  notice. The men, having talked it over, announce that they have  decided on giving him a lob-stick. \"Will he make choice of some  prominent tree in view?\" The visitor usually selects one back from  the water's edge, often on some far hilltop, the more prominent the  better; then an active young fellow is sent up with an axe to trim  the tree. The more embellishment the higher the honor. On the trunk  they then inscribe the name of the stranger, and he is supposed  to give each of the men a plug of tobacco and a drink of whiskey.  Thus they celebrate the man and his monument, and ever afterwards  it is pointed out as \"So-and-so's lob-stick.\"    It was two months before my men judged that I was entitled to a  lob-stick. We were then on Great Slave Lake where the timber was  small, but the best they could get on a small island was chosen  and trimmed into a monument. They were disappointed however, to  find that I would by no means give whiskey to natives, and my treat  had to take a wholly different form.    Grand Rapids, with its multiplicity of perfectly round pot-hole  boulders, was passed in four days, and then, again in company with  the boats, we entered the real canyon of the river.    Down Athabaska's boiling flood  Of seething, leaping, coiling mud.          CHAPTER III    HUMAN NATURE ON THE RIVER        Sunday morning, 26th of May, there was something like a strike  among the sixty half-breeds and Indians that composed the crews.  They were strict Sabbatarians (when it suited them); they believed  that they should do no work, but give up the day to gambling and  drinking. Old John, the chief pilot, wished to take advantage of the  fine flood on the changing river, and drift down at least to the  head of the Boiler Rapids, twenty miles away, The breeds maintained,  with many white swear words, for lack of strong talk in Indian, that  they never yet knew Sunday work to end in anything but disaster,  and they sullenly scattered among the trees, produced their cards,  and proceeded to gamble away their property, next year's pay,  clothes, families, anything, and otherwise show their respect for  the Lord's Day and defiance of old John MacDonald. John made no  reply to their arguments; he merely boarded the cook's boat, and  pushed off into the swift stream with the cooks and all the grub.  In five minutes the strikers were on the twelve big boats doing  their best to live up to orders. John said nothing, and grinned at  me only with his eyes.    The breeds took their defeat in good part after the first minute,  and their commander rose higher in their respect.    At noon we camped above the Boiler Rapids. In the evening I climbed  the 400- or 500-foot hill behind camp and sketched the canyon  looking northward. The spring birds were now beginning to arrive,  but were said to be a month late this year. The ground was everywhere  marked with moose sign; prospects, were brightening.    The mania for killing that is seen in many white men is evidently  a relic of savagery, for all of these Indians and half-breeds  are full of it. Each carries a rifle, and every living thing that  appears on the banks or on the water is fusilladed with Winchesters  until it is dead or out of sight. This explains why we see so  little from the scows. One should be at least a day ahead of them  to meet with wild life on the river.    This morning two Bears appeared on the high bank--and there was the  usual uproar and fusillading; so far as could be learned without  any effect, except the expenditure of thirty or forty cartridges  at five cents each.    On the 27th we came to the Cascade Rapids. The first or Little  Cascade has about two feet fall, the second or Grand Cascade, a  mile farther, is about a six foot sheer drop. These are considered  very difficult to run, and the manner of doing it changes with  every change in season or water level.    We therefore went through an important ceremony, always carried  out in the same way. All 13 boats were beached, the 13 pilots went  ahead on the bank to study the problem, they decided on the one  safe place and manner, then returned, and each of the 13 boats was  run over in 13 different places and manners. They always do this.  You are supposed to have run the Cascades successfully if you cross  them alive, but to have failed if you drown.. In this case all were  successful.    Below the Cascades I had a sample of Indian gratitude that set me  thinking. My success with John MacDonald and others had added the  whole community to my medical practice, for those who were not  sick thought they were. I cheerfully did my best for all, and was  supposed to be persona grata. Just below the Cascade Rapids was  a famous sucker pool, and after we had camped three Indians came,  saying that the pool was full of suckers--would I lend them my  canoe to get some?    Away they went, and from afar I was horrified to see them clubbing  the fish with my beautiful thin-bladed maple paddles. They returned  with a boat load of 3- and 4-pound Suckers (Catostomus) and 2  paddles broken. Each of their friends came and received one or two  fine fish, for there were plenty. I, presumably part owner of the  catch, since I owned the boat, selected one small one for myself,  whereupon the Indian insolently demanded 25 cents for it; and  these were the men I had been freely doctoring for two weeks! Not  to speak of the loaned canoe and broken paddles! Then did I say a  few things to all and sundry--stinging, biting things, ungainsayable  and forcible things--and took possession of all the fish that were  left, so the Indians slunk off in sullen silence.    Gratitude seems an unknown feeling among these folk; you may give  presents and help and feed them all you like, the moment you want  a slight favour of them they demand the uttermost cent. In attempting  to analyse this I was confronted by the fact that among themselves  they are kind and hospitable, and at length discovered that their  attitude toward us is founded on the ideas that all white men are  very rich, that the Indian has made them so by allowing them to  come into this country, that the Indian is very poor because he  never was properly compensated, and that therefore all he can get  out of said white man is much less than the white man owes him.    As we rounded a point one day a Lynx appeared statuesque on a stranded  cake of ice, a hundred yards off, and gazed at the approaching  boats. True to their religion, the half-breeds seized their rifles,  the bullets whistled harmlessly about the \"Peeshoo\"--whereupon he  turned and walked calmly up the slope, stopping to look at each  fresh volley, but finally waved his stumpy tail and walked unharmed  over the ridge. Distance fifty yards.    On May 28 we reached Fort MacMurray.    Here I saw several interesting persons: Miss Christine Gordon, the  postmaster; Joe Bird, a half-breed with all the advanced ideas of  a progressive white man; and an American ex-patriot, G------, a  tall, raw-boned Yank from Illinois. He was a typical American of  the kind, that knows little of America and nothing of Europe; but  shrewd and successful in spite of these limitations. In appearance  he was not unlike Abraham Lincoln. He was a rabid American, and  why he stayed here was a question.    He had had no detailed tidings from home for years, and I never saw  "]]]
