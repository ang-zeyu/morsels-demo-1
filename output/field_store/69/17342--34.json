MIME        Though thou hast searched,      And though much thou hast found,  I need neither seeker nor finder.      Lonely am I,      And lone would be;  Idlers I harbour not here.    WANDERER [_Again coming a little nearer._        There were many      Thought they were wise,      Yet what they needed      Knew not at all;      Useful lore was      Theirs for the asking,  Wisdom was their reward.    MIME            [_More and more anxious as he sees the Wanderer          approach._        Idle knowledge      Some may covet;  I know enough for my needs.            [_The Wanderer reaches the hearth._        My own wits suffice,      I want no more,  So, wise one, keep on thy way.    WANDERER [_Sitting down at the hearth._        Nay, here at thy hearth      I vow by my head  To answer all thou shalt ask.      My head is thine,      'Tis forfeit to thee,      Unless I can give      Answers good,  Deftly redeeming the pledge.    MIME            [_Who has been staring at the Wanderer          open-mouthed, now shrinks back; aside, dejectedly._    Now how to get rid of the spy?  The questions asked must be artful.            [_He summons up courage for an assumption of          sternness; aloud._        Thy head for thy      Lodging pays:  'Tis pawned; now seek to redeem it.      Three the questions      Thou shalt be asked.    WANDERER    Thrice then I must answer.    MIME [_Pulls himself together and reflects._        Since, far on the back      Of the wide earth roving,  Thy feet have ranged o'er the world,      Come, answer me this:      Tell me what race  Dwells in the earth's deep gorges.    WANDERER        In the depths of earth  The Nibelungs have their home;  Nibelheim is their land.      Black elves they all are;      Black Alberich  Once was their ruler and lord.      He subdued the busy      Folk by a ring  Gifted with magical might;      And they piled up      Shimmering gold,      Precious, fine-wrought,  To win him the world and its glory.    Proceed with thy questions, dwarf.    MIME            [_Sinks into deeper and deeper meditation._        Thou knowest much,      Wanderer,  Of the hidden depths of earth.      Now, answer me this:      Tell me what race  Breathes on earth's back and moves there.    WANDERER        On the earth's broad back  The race of the giants arose;  Riesenheim is their land.      Fasolt and Fafner,      The rude folk's rulers,  Envied the Nibelung's might.      So his wonderful hoard      They won for themselves,  And with it gained the ring too.      The brothers quarrelled      About the ring,      And slain was Fasolt.      In dragon's form  Fafner now watches the hoard.    One question threatens me still.    MIME [_Quite lost in thought._        Much, Wanderer,      Thou dost know  Of the earth's back rude and rugged.      Now answer aright:      Tell me what race  Dwells above in the clouds.    WANDERER        Above in the clouds      Dwell the Immortals;  Walhall is their home.      They are light-spirits;      Light-Alberich,  Wotan, rules as their lord.      From the world-ash-tree's      Holiest bough once  Wotan made him a shaft.      Though the stem rot,      The spear shall endure,      And with that spear-point  Wotan rules the world.      Trustworthy runes      Of holy treaties  Deep in the shaft he cut.      Who wields the spear      Carried by Wotan      The haft of the world  Holds in his hand.      Before him kneels      The Nibelung host;      The giants, tamed,      Bow to his will.  All must obey, and for ever,  The spear's eternal lord.            [_He strikes the ground with the spear as if by          accident, and a low growl of thunder is heard, by          which Mime is violently alarmed._    Confess now, cunning dwarf,  Are not my answers right,  And is not my head redeemed?    MIME            [_After attentively watching the Wanderer with the          spear, becomes very frightened, seeks in a confused          manner for his tools, and looks timidly aside._        Both thou hast won,      Wager and head;  Thy way now, Wanderer, go.    WANDERER        Knowledge useful to thee      Thou wert to ask for;  Forfeit my head if I failed.      Forfeit be thine,      Knowest thou not  The thing it would serve thee to know.      Greeting thou      Gavest me not;      My head into thy hand      I gave  That I might rest by thy hearth.      By wager fair      Forfeit thy head,      Canst thou not answer      Three things when asked;  So sharpen well, Mime, thy wits!    [Illustration:    \"In dragon's form                Fafner now watches the hoard\"                             --See p. 21]    MIME            [_Very much frightened, and after much hesitation,          at last composes himself with timid submission._        Long it is      Since I left my land;      Long it seems to me      Since I was born.  I saw here the eye of Wotan  Shine, peering into my cave;      His glance dazes      My mother-wit.  But well were it now to be wise.  Come then, Wanderer, ask.  Perhaps fortune will favour  The dwarf, and redeem his head.    WANDERER [_Comfortably sitting down again._        Then first, honest dwarf,      Answer this question:  Tell the name of the race  That Wotan treats most harshly,            [_Very softly, but audibly._    And yet loves beyond all the rest.    MIME [_With more cheerfulness._        Though unlearnèd      In heroes' kinship,  This question I answer with ease.      The Wälsungs are Wotan's      Chosen stock,      By him begotten      And loved with passion,  Though they are shown no grace.      Siegmund and Sieglinde      Born were to Wälse,      A wild and desperate      Twin-born pair;  Siegfried had they as son,  The strongest shoot from the tree.      My head, say, is it      Still, Wanderer, mine?    WANDERER [_Pleasantly._        How well thou knowest      And namest the race!  Rogue, I see thou art clever.      The foremost question      Thou hast solved;  The second answer me, dwarf.      A crafty Niblung      Shelters Siegfried,  Hoping he will slay Fafner,  That the dwarf may be lord of the hoard,  The ring being his.      Say, what sword,      If Fafner to fall is,  Must be by Siegfried swung?    MIME            [_Forgetting his present situation more and more,          rubs his hands joyfully._        Nothung is      The name of the sword;      Into an ash-tree's stem      Wotan struck it;  One only might bear it:  He who could draw it forth.      The strongest heroes      Tried it and failed;      Only by Siegmund      Was it done;  Well he fought with the sword  Till on Wotan's spear it was split.      By a crafty smith      Are the fragments kept,      For he knows that alone      With the Wotan sword  A brave and foolish boy,  Siegfried, can slay the foe.            [_Much pleased._        A second time      My head have I saved?      [Illustration: Mime and the Wanderer. See p. 17]      WANDERER [_Laughing_.        The wisest of wise ones      Thou must be, surely;  Who else could so clever be!      But wouldst thou by craft      Employ the boy-hero  As instrument of thy purpose,      With one question more      I threaten thee.      Tell me, thou artful      Armourer,  Whose skill from the doughty splinters  Nothung the sword shall fashion.    MIME [_Starts up in great terror._        The splinters! The sword!      Alas! my head reels!      What shall I do?      What can I say?      Accursèd sword!      I was mad to steal it!      A perilous pass      It has brought me to.      Always too hard      To yield to my hammer!      Rivet, solder--      Useless are both.            [_He throws his tools about as if he had gone          crazy, and breaks out in utter despair._        The cleverest smith      Living has failed;      And, that being so,      Who shall succeed?  How rede aright such a riddle?    WANDERER [_Has risen quietly from the hearth._    Three things thou wert to ask me;  Thrice was I to reply.      Thy questions were      Of far-off things,  But what stood here at thy hand--  Needed much--that was forgot,      Now that I guess it,      Thou goest crazed,      And won by me      Is the cunning one's head.  Now, Fafner's dauntless subduer,  Hear, thou death-doomed dwarf.      By him who knows not      How to fear  Nothung shall be forged.            [_Mime stares at him; he turns to go._        So ward thy head      Well from to-day.  I leave it forfeit to him  Who has never learned to fear.            [_He turns away smiling, and disappears quickly          in the wood. Mime has sunk on to the bench          overwhelmed._    MIME            [_Stares before him into the sunlit wood, and          begins to tremble more and more violently._        Accursèd light!      The air is on fire!      What flickers and flashes?      What buzzes and whirs?      What sways there and swings      And circles about?      What glitters and gleams      In the sun's hot glow?      What rustles and hums      And rings so loud?      With roll and roar      It crashes this way!      It bursts through the wood,      Making for me!            [_He rises up in terror._        Its jaws are wide open,      Eager for prey;      The dragon will catch me!      Fafner! Fafner!

[_He enters the cave._    Quick, come show me the sword.            [_He pauses in surprise._        Where hides the smith?      Has he made off?  Hey, there! Mime, thou coward!  Where art thou? Where hidest thou?    MIME            [_In a small voice, from behind the anvil._        'Tis thou then, child?      Art thou alone?    SIEGFRIED [_Laughing._        Under the anvil?

Even less than the  Eddorians could they be killed by any possible application of physical  force. Past masters of mental science, they knew that no possible  concentration of Eddorian mental force could kill any one of them. And  if they were to be forced out of normal space, what matter? To such  mentalities as theirs, any given space would serve as well as any other.    No, they were fighting for an ideal; for the peaceful, harmonious,  liberty-loving Civilization which they had envisaged as developing  throughout, and eventually entirely covering the myriads of planets  of, two tremendous Island Universes. Also, they felt a heavy weight  of responsibility. Since all these races, existing and yet to appear,  had sprung from and would spring from the Arisian life-spores which  permeated this particular space, they all were and would be, at bottom,  Arisian. It was starkly unthinkable that Arisia would leave them to  the eternal dominance of such a rapacious, such a tyrannical, such a  hellishly insatiable breed of monsters.    Therefore the Arisians fought; efficiently if insidiously. They did  not--they could not--interfere openly with Eddore's ruthless conquest  of world after world; with Eddore's ruthless smashing of Civilization  after Civilization. They did, however, see to it, by selective matings  and the establishment of blood-lines upon numberless planets, that the  trend of the level of intelligence was definitely and steadily upward.    Four Molders of Civilization--Drounli, Kriedigan, Nedanillor, and  Brolenteen, who, in fusion, formed the \"Mentor of Arisia\" who was to  become known to every wearer of Civilization's Lens--were individually  responsible for the Arisian program of development upon the four  planets of Tellus, Rigel IV, Velantia, and Palain VII. Drounli  established upon Tellus two principal lines of blood. In unbroken male  line of descent the Kinnisons went back to long before the dawn of  even mythical Tellurian history. Kinnexa of Atlantis, daughter of one  Kinnison and sister of another, is the first of the blood to be named  in these annals; but the line was then already old. So was the other  line; characterized throughout its tremendous length, male and female,  by peculiarly spectacular red-bronze-auburn hair and equally striking  gold-flecked, tawny eyes.    Nor did these strains mix. Drounli had made it psychologically  impossible for them to mix until the penultimate stage of development  should have been reached.    While that stage was still in the future Virgil Samms appeared, and  all Arisia knew that the time had come to engage the Eddorians openly,  mind to mind. Gharlane-Roger was curbed, savagely and sharply. Every  Eddorian, wherever he was working, found his every line of endeavor  solidly blocked.    Gharlane, as has been intimated, constructed a supposedly irresistible  weapon and attacked his Arisian blocker, with results already told. At  that failure Gharlane knew that there was something terribly amiss;  that it had been amiss for over two thousand million Tellurian years.  Really alarmed for the first time in his long life, he flashed back to  Eddore; to warn his fellows and to take counsel with them as to what  should be done. And the massed and integrated force of all Arisia was  only an instant behind him.           *       *       *       *       *    Arisia struck Eddore's outermost screen, and in the instant of impact  that screen went down. And then, instantaneously and all unperceived  by the planet's defenders, the Arisian forces split. The Elders,  including all the Molders, seized the Eddorian who had been handling  that screen--threw around him an impenetrable net of force--yanked him  out into inter-galactic space.    Then, driving in resistlessly, they turned the luckless wight inside  out. And before the victim died under their poignant probings, the  Elders of Arisia learned everything that the Eddorian and all of his  ancestors had ever known. They then withdrew to Arisia, leaving their  younger, weaker, partially-developed fellows to do whatever they could  against mighty Eddore.    Whether the attack of these lesser forces would be stopped at the  second, the third, the fourth, or the innermost screen; whether they  would reach the planet itself and perhaps do some actual damage before  being driven off; was immaterial. Eddore must be allowed and would  be allowed to repel that invasion with ease. For cycles to come the  Eddorians must and would believe that they had nothing really to fear  from Arisia.    The real battle, however, had been won. The Arisian visualizations  could now be extended to portray every essential element of the  climactic conflict which was eventually to come. It was no cheerful  conclusion at which the Arisians arrived, since their visualizations  all agreed in showing that the only possible method of wiping out the  Eddorians would also of necessity end their own usefulness as Guardians  of Civilization.    Such an outcome having been shown necessary, however, the Arisians  accepted it, and worked toward it, unhesitatingly.          CHAPTER 2      As has been said, The Hill, which had been built to be the Tellurian  headquarters of the Triplanetary Service and which was now the  headquarters of the half-organized Solarian Patrol, was--and is--a  truncated, alloy-sheathed, honey-combed mountain. But, since human  beings do not like to live eternally underground, no matter how  beautifully lighted or how carefully and comfortably air-conditioned  the dungeon may be, the Reservation spread far beyond the foot of  that gray, forbidding, mirror-smooth cone of metal. Well outside that  farflung Reservation there was a small city; there were hundreds  of highly productive farms; and, particularly upon this bright May  afternoon, there was a Recreation Park, containing, among other things,  dozens of tennis courts.    One of these courts was three-quarters enclosed by stands, from which  a couple of hundred people were watching a match which seemed to be of  some little local importance. Two men sat in a box which had seats for  twenty, and watched admiringly the pair who seemed in a fair way to win  in straight sets the mixed-doubles championship of the Hill.    \"Fine-looking couple, Rod, if I do say so myself, as well as being  smooth performers.\" Solarian Councillor Virgil Samms spoke to his  companion as the opponents changed courts. \"I still think, though, the  young hussy ought to wear some clothes--those white nylon shorts make  her look nakeder even than usual. I told her so, too, the jade, but she  keeps on wearing less and less.\"    \"Of course,\" Commissioner Roderick K. Kinnison laughed quietly. \"What  did you expect? She got her hair and eyes from you, why not your  hard-headedness, too? One thing, though, that's all to the good--she's  got what it takes to strip ship that way, and most of 'em haven't. But  what I can't understand is why they don't....\" He paused.    \"I don't either. Lord knows we've thrown them at each other hard  enough, and Jack Kinnison and Jill Samms would certainly make a pair to  draw to. But if they won't ... but maybe they will yet. They're still  youngsters, and they're friendly enough.\"    If Samms père could have been out on the court, however, instead of in  the box, he would have been surprised; for young Kinnison, although  smiling enough as to face, was addressing his gorgeous partner in terms  which carried little indeed of friendliness.    \"Listen, you bird-brained, knot-headed, grand-standing half-wit!\" he  stormed, voice low but bitterly intense. \"I ought to beat your alleged  brains out! I've told you a thousand times to watch your own territory  and _stay out of mine_! If you had been where you belonged, or even  taken my signal, Frank couldn't have made that thirty-all point; and  if Lois hadn't netted she'd've caught you flat-footed, a kilometer  out of position, and made it deuce. What do you think you're doing,  anyway--playing tennis or seeing how many innocent bystanders you can  bring down out of control?\"    \"What do _you_ think?\" the girl sneered, sweetly. Her tawny eyes, only  a couple of inches below his own, almost emitted sparks. \"And just  look at who's trying to tell who how to do what! For your information,  Master Pilot John K. Kinnison, I'll tell you that just because you  can't quit being 'Killer' Kinnison even long enough to let two good  friends of ours get a point now and then, or maybe even a game, is no  reason why I've got to turn into 'Killer' Samms. And I'll also tell  you....\"    \"You'll tell me nothing, Jill--I'm telling _you_! Start giving away  points in anything and you'll find out some day that you've given away  too many. I'm not having any of that kind of game--and as long as  you're playing with me you aren't either--or else. If you louse up this  match just once more, the next ball I serve will hit the tightest part  of those fancy white shorts of yours--right where the hip pocket would  be if they had any--and it'll raise a welt that will make you eat off  of the mantel for three days. So watch your step!\"    \"You insufferable lug! I'd like to smash this racket over your head!  I'll do it, too, and walk off the court, if you don't....\"    The whistle blew. Virgilia Samms, all smiles, toed the base-line and  became the personification and embodiment of smoothly flowing motion.  The ball whizzed over the net, barely clearing it--a sizzling service  ace. The game went on.    And a few minutes later, in the shower room, where Jack Kinnison was  caroling lustily while plying a towel, a huge young man strode up and  slapped him ringingly between the shoulder blades.    \"Congratulations, Jack, and so forth. But there's a thing I want to ask  you. Confidential, sort of...?\"    \"Shoot! Haven't we been eating out of the same dish for lo, these many  moons? Why the diffidence all of a sudden, Mase? It isn't in character.\""]]]
