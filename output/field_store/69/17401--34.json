HRUT SAILS OUT TO ICELAND    Hrut stayed with the king that winter in good cheer, but when  spring came he grew very silent.  Gunnhillda finds that out, and  said to him when they two were alone together, \"Art thou sick at  heart?\"    \"So it is,\" said Hrut, \"as the saying runs -- `Ill goes it with  those who are born on a barren land.'\"    \"Wilt thou to Iceland?\" she asks.    \"Yes,\" he answered.    \"Hast thou a wife out there?\" she asked; and he answers, \"No.\"    \"But I am sure that is true,\" she says; and so they ceased  talking about the matter.    Shortly after Hrut went before the king and bade him Good-day;  and the king said, \"What dost thou want now, Hrut?\"    \"I am come to ask, lord, that you give me leave to go to  Iceland.\"    \"Will thine honour be greater there than here?\" asks the king.    \"No, it will not,\" said Hrut; \"but every one must win the work  that is set before him.\"    \"It is pulling a rope against a strong man,\" said Gunnhillda, \"so  give him leave to go as best suits him.\"    There was a bad harvest that year in the land, yet Gunnhillda  gave Hrut as much meal as he chose to have; and now he busks him  to sail out to Iceland, and Auzur with him; and when they were  \"all-boun,\" Hrut went to find the king and Gunnhillda.  She led  him aside to talk alone, and said to him, \"Here is a gold ring  which I will give thee;\" and with that she clasped it round his  wrist.    \"Many good gifts have I had from thee,\" said Hrut.    Then she put her hands round his neck and kissed him, and said,  \"If I have as much power over thee as I think, I lay this spell  on thee that thou mayst never have any pleasure in living with  that woman on whom thy heart is set in Iceland, but with other  women thou mayst get on well enough, and now it is like to go  well with neither of us; but thou hast not believed what I have  been saying.\"    Hrut laughed when he heard that, and went away; after that he  came before the king and thanked him; and the king spoke kindly  to him, and bade him \"farewell.\"  Hrut went straight to his ship,  and they had a fair wind all the way until they ran into  Borgarfirth.    As soon as the ship was made fast to the land, Hrut rode west  home, but Auzur stayed by the ship to unload her and lay her up.  Hrut rode straight to Hauskuldstede, and Hauskuld gave him a  hearty welcome, and Hrut told him all about his travels.  After  that they send men east across the rivers to tell Fiddle Mord to  make ready for the bridal feast; but the two brothers rode to the  ship, and on the way Hauskuld told Hrut how his money-matters  stood, and his goods had gained much since he was away.  Then  Hrut said, \"The reward is less worth than it ought to be, but I  will give thee as much meal as thou needst for thy household next  winter.\"    Then they drew the ship on land on rollers, and made her snug in  her shed, but all the wares on board her they carried away into  the Dales westward.  Hrut stayed at home at Hrutstede till winter  was six weeks off, and then the brothers made ready and Auzur  with them, to ride to Hrut's wedding.  Sixty men ride with them,  and they rode east till they came to Rangriver plains.  There  they found a crowd of guests, and the men took their seats on  benches down the length of the hall, but the women were seated on  the cross-benches on the dais, and the bride was rather downcast.  So they drank out the feast and it went off well.  Mord pays down  his daughter's portion, and she rides west with her husband and  his train.  So they ride till they reach home.  Hrut gave over  everything into her hands inside the house, and all were pleased  at that; but for all that she and Hrut did not pull well together  as man and wife, and so things went on till spring, and when  spring came Hrut had a journey to make to the Westfirths, to get  in the money for which he had sold his wares; but before he set  off his wife says to him, \"Dost thou mean to be back before men  ride to the Thing?\"    \"Why dost thou ask?\" said Hrut.    \"I will ride to the Thing,\" she said, \"to meet my father.\"    \"So it shall be,\" said he, \"and I will ride to the Thing along  with thee.\"    \"Well and good,\" she says.    After that Hrut rode from home west to the Firths, got in all his  money, and laid it out anew, and rode home again.  When he came  home he busked him to ride to the Thing, and made all his  neighbours ride with him.  His brother Hauskuld rode among the  rest.  Then Hrut said to his wife, \"If thou hast as much mind now  to go to the Thing as thou saidst a while ago, busk thyself and  ride along with me.\"    She was not slow in getting herself ready, and then they all  rode to the Thing.  Unna went to her father's booth, and he gave  her a hearty welcome, but she seemed somewhat heavy-hearted, and  when he saw that he said to her, \"I have seen thee with a merrier  face.  Hast thou anything on thy mind?\"    She began to weep, and answered nothing.  Then he said to her  again.  \"Why didst thou ride to the Thing, if thou wilt not tell  me thy secret?  Dost thou dislike living away there in the west?\"    Then she answered him, \"I would give all I own in the world that  I had never gone thither.\"    \"Well!\" said Mord, \"I'll soon get to the bottom of this.\"  Then  he sends men to fetch Hauskuld and Hrut, and they came  straightway; and when they came in to see Mord, he rose up to  meet them and gave them a hearty welcome, and asked them to sit  down.  Then they talked a long time in a friendly way, and at  last Mord said to Hauskuld, \"Why does my daughter think so ill of  life in the west yonder?\"    \"Let her speak out,\" said Hrut, \"if she has anything to lay to my  charge.\"    But she brought no charge against him.  Then Hrut made them ask  his neighbours and household how he treated her, and all bore him  good witness, saying that she did just as she pleased in the  house.    Then Mord said, \"Home thou shalt go, and be content with thy lot;  for all the witness goes better for him than for thee.\"    After that Hrut rode home from the Thing, and his wife with him,  and all went smoothly between them that summer; but when spring  came it was the old story over again, and things grew worse and  worse as the spring went on.  Hrut had again a journey to make  west to the Firths, and gave out that he would not ride to the  Althing, but Unna his wife said little about it.  So Hrut went  away west to the Firths.        7. UNNA SEPARATES FROM HRUT    Now the time for the Thing was coming on.  Unna spoke to Sigmund,  Auzur's son, and asked if he would ride to the Thing with her; he  said he could not ride if his kinsman Hrut set his face against  it.    \"Well!\" says she, \"I spoke to thee because I have better right to  ask this from thee than from any one else.\"    He answered, \"I will make a bargain with thee: thou must promise  to ride back west with me, and to have no underhand dealings  against Hrut or myself.\"    So she promised that, and then they rode to the Thing.  Her  father Mord was at the Thing, and was very glad to see her, and  asked her to stay in his booth while the Thing lasted, and she  did so.    \"Now,\" said Mord, \"what hast thou to tell me of thy mate, Hrut?\"    Then she sung him a song, in which she praised Hrut's liberality,  but said he was not master of himself.  She herself was ashamed  to speak out.    Mord was silent a short time, and then said, \"Thou hast now that  on thy mind I see, daughter, which thou dost not wish that any  one should know save myself, and thou wilt trust to me rather  than any one else to help thee out of thy trouble.\"    Then they went aside to talk, to a place where none could  overhear what they said; and then Mord said to his daughter,  \"Now, tell me all that is between you two, and don't make more of  the matter than it is worth.\"    \"So it shall be,\" she answered, and sang two songs, in which she  revealed the cause of their misunderstanding; and when Mord  pressed her to speak out, she told him how she and Hrut could not  live together, because he was spellbound, and that she wished to  leave him.    \"Thou didst right to tell me all this,\" said Mord, \"and now I  will give thee a piece of advice, which will stand thee in good  stead, if thou canst carry it out to the letter.  First of all,  thou must ride home from the Thing, and by that time thy husband  will have come back, and will be glad to see thee; thou must be  blithe and buxom to him, and he will think a good change has come  over thee, and thou must show no signs of coldness or ill-temper,  but when spring comes thou must sham sickness, and take to thy  bed.  Hrut will not lose time in guessing what thy sickness can  be, nor will he scold thee at all, but he will rather beg every  one to take all the care they can of thee.  After that he will  set off west to the Firths, and Sigmund with him, for he will  have to flit all his goods home from the Firths west, and he will  be away till the summer is far spent.  But when men ride to the  Thing, and after all have ridden from the Dales that mean to ride  thither; then thou must rise from thy bed and summon men to go  along with thee to the Thing; and when thou art 'all-boun,' then  shalt thou go to thy bed, and the men with thee who are to bear  thee company, and thou shalt take witness before thy husband's  bed, and declare thyself separated from him by such a lawful  separation as may hold good according to the judgment of the  Great Thing, and the laws of the land; and at the man's door the  main door of the house, thou shalt take the same witness.  After  that ride away, and ride over Laxriverdale Heath, and so on over  Holtbeacon Heath; for they will look for thee by way of  Hrutfirth.  And so ride on till thou comest to me; then I will  see after the matter.  But into his hands thou"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/599"],[0,"Vanity Fair (#3)"],[1,"and Roman-nosed  head (on the top of which figured a large and solemn turban), she said,  \"Miss Sharp, I wish you a good morning.\" As the Hammersmith Semiramis  spoke, she waved one hand, both by way of adieu, and to give Miss Sharp  an opportunity of shaking one of the fingers of the hand which was left  out for that purpose.    Miss Sharp only folded her own hands with a very frigid smile and bow,  and quite declined to accept the proffered honour; on which Semiramis  tossed up her turban more indignantly than ever.  In fact, it was a  little battle between the young lady and the old one, and the latter  was worsted.  \"Heaven bless you, my child,\" said she, embracing Amelia,  and scowling the while over the girl's shoulder at Miss Sharp.  \"Come  away, Becky,\" said Miss Jemima, pulling the young woman away in great  alarm, and the drawing-room door closed upon them for ever.    Then came the struggle and parting below.  Words refuse to tell it. All  the servants were there in the hall--all the dear friends--all the young  ladies--the dancing-master who had just arrived; and there was such a  scuffling, and hugging, and kissing, and crying, with the hysterical  YOOPS of Miss Swartz, the parlour-boarder, from her room, as no pen can  depict, and as the tender heart would fain pass over. The embracing was  over; they parted--that is, Miss Sedley parted from her friends.  Miss  Sharp had demurely entered the carriage some minutes before.  Nobody  cried for leaving HER.    Sambo of the bandy legs slammed the carriage door on his young weeping  mistress.  He sprang up behind the carriage.  \"Stop!\" cried Miss  Jemima, rushing to the gate with a parcel.    \"It's some sandwiches, my dear,\" said she to Amelia. \"You may be  hungry, you know; and Becky, Becky Sharp, here's a book for you that my  sister--that is, I--Johnson's Dixonary, you know; you mustn't leave us  without that.  Good-by.  Drive on, coachman.  God bless you!\"    And the kind creature retreated into the garden, overcome with emotion.    But, lo! and just as the coach drove off, Miss Sharp put her pale face  out of the window and actually flung the book back into the garden.    This almost caused Jemima to faint with terror.  \"Well, I never\"--said  she--\"what an audacious\"--Emotion prevented her from completing either  sentence.  The carriage rolled away; the great gates were closed; the  bell rang for the dancing lesson.  The world is before the two young  ladies; and so, farewell to Chiswick Mall.        CHAPTER II    In Which Miss Sharp and Miss Sedley Prepare to Open the Campaign    When Miss Sharp had performed the heroical act mentioned in the last  chapter, and had seen the Dixonary, flying over the pavement of the  little garden, fall at length at the feet of the astonished Miss  Jemima, the young lady's countenance, which had before worn an almost  livid look of hatred, assumed a smile that perhaps was scarcely more  agreeable, and she sank back in the carriage in an easy frame of mind,  saying--\"So much for the Dixonary; and, thank God, I'm out of Chiswick.\"    Miss Sedley was almost as flurried at the act of defiance as Miss  Jemima had been; for, consider, it was but one minute that she had left  school, and the impressions of six years are not got over in that space  of time.  Nay, with some persons those awes and terrors of youth last  for ever and ever.  I know, for instance, an old gentleman of  sixty-eight, who said to me one morning at breakfast, with a very  agitated countenance, \"I dreamed last night that I was flogged by Dr.  Raine.\" Fancy had carried him back five-and-fifty years in the course  of that evening.  Dr. Raine and his rod were just as awful to him in  his heart, then, at sixty-eight, as they had been at thirteen.  If the  Doctor, with a large birch, had appeared bodily to him, even at the age  of threescore and eight, and had said in awful voice, \"Boy, take down  your pant--\"? Well, well, Miss Sedley was exceedingly alarmed at this  act of insubordination.    \"How could you do so, Rebecca?\" at last she said, after a pause.    \"Why, do you think Miss Pinkerton will come out and order me back to  the black-hole?\" said Rebecca, laughing.    \"No: but--\"    \"I hate the whole house,\" continued Miss Sharp in a fury.  \"I hope I  may never set eyes on it again.  I wish it were in the bottom of the  Thames, I do; and if Miss Pinkerton were there, I wouldn't pick her  out, that I wouldn't.  O how I should like to see her floating in the  water yonder, turban and all, with her train streaming after her, and  her nose like the beak of a wherry.\"    \"Hush!\" cried Miss Sedley.    \"Why, will the black footman tell tales?\" cried Miss Rebecca, laughing.  \"He may go back and tell Miss Pinkerton that I hate her with all my  soul; and I wish he would; and I wish I had a means of proving it, too.  For two years I have only had insults and outrage from her. I have been  treated worse than any servant in the kitchen. I have never had a  friend or a kind word, except from you.  I have been made to tend the  little girls in the lower schoolroom, and to talk French to the Misses,  until I grew sick of my mother tongue. But that talking French to Miss  Pinkerton was capital fun, wasn't it? She doesn't know a word of  French, and was too proud to confess it.  I believe it was that which  made her part with me; and so thank Heaven for French.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Empereur! Vive Bonaparte!\"    \"O Rebecca, Rebecca, for shame!\" cried Miss Sedley; for this was the  greatest blasphemy Rebecca had as yet uttered; and in those days, in  England, to say, \"Long live Bonaparte!\" was as much as to say, \"Long  live Lucifer!\" \"How can you--how dare you have such wicked, revengeful  thoughts?\"    \"Revenge may be wicked, but it's natural,\" answered Miss Rebecca. \"I'm  no angel.\" And, to say the truth, she certainly was not.    For it may be remarked in the course of this little conversation (which  took place as the coach rolled along lazily by the river side) that  though Miss Rebecca Sharp has twice had occasion to thank Heaven, it  has been, in the first place, for ridding her of some person whom she  hated, and secondly, for enabling her to bring her enemies to some sort  of perplexity or confusion; neither of which are very amiable motives  for religious gratitude, or such as would be put forward by persons of  a kind and placable disposition.  Miss Rebecca was not, then, in the  least kind or placable.  All the world used her ill, said this young  misanthropist, and we may be pretty certain that persons whom all the  world treats ill, deserve entirely the treatment they get.  The world  is a looking-glass, and gives back to every man the reflection of his  own face.  Frown at it, and it will in turn look sourly upon you; laugh  at it and with it, and it is a jolly kind companion; and so let all  young persons take their choice. This is certain, that if the world  neglected Miss Sharp, she never was known to have done a good action in  behalf of anybody; nor can it be expected that twenty-four young ladies  should all be as amiable as the heroine of this work, Miss Sedley (whom  we have selected for the very reason that she was the best-natured of  all, otherwise what on earth was to have prevented us from putting up  Miss Swartz, or Miss Crump, or Miss Hopkins, as heroine in her place!)  it could not be expected that every one should be of the humble and  gentle temper of Miss Amelia Sedley; should take every opportunity to  vanquish Rebecca's hard-heartedness and ill-humour; and, by a thousand  kind words and offices, overcome, for once at least, her hostility to  her kind.    Miss Sharp's father was an artist, and in that quality had given  lessons of drawing at Miss Pinkerton's school. He was a clever man; a  pleasant companion; a careless student; with a great propensity for  running into debt, and a partiality for the tavern.  When he was drunk,  he used to beat his wife and daughter; and the next morning, with a  headache, he would rail at the world for its neglect of his genius, and  abuse, with a good deal of cleverness, and sometimes with perfect  reason, the fools, his brother painters.  As it was with the utmost  difficulty that he could keep himself, and as he owed money for a mile  round Soho, where he lived, he thought to better his circumstances by  marrying a young woman of the French nation, who was by profession an  opera-girl.  The humble calling of her female parent Miss Sharp never  alluded to, but used to state subsequently that the Entrechats were a  noble family of Gascony, and took great pride in her descent from them.  And curious it is that as she advanced in life this young lady's  ancestors increased in rank and splendour.    Rebecca's mother had had some education somewhere, and her daughter  spoke French with purity and a Parisian accent.  It was in those days  rather a rare accomplishment, and led to her engagement with the  orthodox Miss Pinkerton.  For her mother being dead, her father,  finding himself not likely to recover, after his third attack of  delirium tremens, wrote a manly and pathetic letter to Miss Pinkerton,  recommending the orphan child to her protection, and so descended to  the grave, after two bailiffs had quarrelled over his corpse.  Rebecca  was seventeen when she came to Chiswick, and was bound over as an  articled pupil; her duties being to talk French, as we have seen; and  her privileges to live cost free, and, with a few guineas a year, to  gather scraps of knowledge from the professors who attended the school.    She was small and slight in person; pale, sandy-haired, and with eyes  habitually cast down: when they looked up they were very large, odd,  and attractive; so attractive that the Reverend Mr. Crisp, fresh from  Oxford, and curate to the Vicar of Chiswick, the Reverend Mr.  Flowerdew, fell in love with Miss Sharp; being shot dead by a glance of  her eyes which was fired all the way"]]]
