APPENDIX    GENEALOGY    TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE      CHAPTER I.  ------------------------    Parentage:--Childhood:--Youth:--Education:--Early  Impressions:--Journey Westward:--Making a New Farm in the  Wilderness of Oswego.    Parley Parker Pratt, the subject and author of these sketches,  and third son of Jared and Charity Pratt, of Canaan, Columbia  County, New York, was born April 12, 1807, in Burlington, Otsego  County, N.Y.*    [Footnote] *For genealogy in full see Appendix.    Of my early youth I shall say but little. My father was a hard  working man, and generally occupied in agricultural pursuits; and,  although limited in education, he sometimes taught school, and even  vocal music.    He was a man of excellent morals; and he exerted himself  diligently, by stern example as well as precept, to instill into  the minds of his children every principle of integrity, honesty,  honor and virtue.    He taught us to venerate our Father in Heaven, Jesus Christ, His  prophets and Apostles, as well as the Scriptures written by them;  while at the same time he belonged to no religious sect, and was  careful to preserve his children free from all prejudice in favor  of or against any particular denomination, into which the so-called  Christian world was then unhappily divided.    We frequently attended public worship, with Presbyterians,  Baptists and Methodists in turn, or, as circumstances rendered  convenient--having equal respect for these several forms of worship  and their adherents. Though my father did sometimes manifest a  decided disapprobation of a hireling clergy, who seemed, in his  estimation, to prefer the learning and wisdom of man to the gifts  and power of the Holy Ghost.    His means to educate his children were very limited; but that  excellent system of common school education early established in  the Eastern and Middle States afforded to them, in common with  others, an opportunity to learn, and even to become familiar with  the four great branches, which are the foundation of literature and  the sciences.    My opportunity, even in these institutions, was far more limited  than most of the youths of my country, on account of my time being  mostly required in physical exertion to assist in sustaining the  family of my father.    But I always loved a book. If I worked hard, a book was in my  hand in the morning while others were sitting down to breakfast;  the same at noon; if I had a few moments, a _book_! a BOOK!  A book at evening, while others slept or sported; a book on  Sundays; a book at every leisure moment of my life.    At the age of seven years my mother gave me lessons to read in  the Scriptures; I read of Joseph in Egypt, his dreams, his  servitude, his temptation and exaltation; his kindness and  affection for his father and brethren. All this inspired me with  love, and with the noblest sentiments ever planted in the bosom of  man.    I read of David and Goliath;--of Saul and Samuel;--of Samson and  the Philistines:--all these inspired me with hatred to the deeds of  evil doers and love for good men and their deeds.    After this I read of Jesus and his Apostles; and O, how I loved  them! How I longed to fall at the feet of Jesus; to worship him, or  to offer my life for his.    At about twelve years of age I read of the first resurrection,  as described by John the Apostle, in the 20th chapter of his  Revelation; how they, martyrs of Jesus, and those who kept His  commandments would live and reign with Christ a thousand years,  while the rest of the dead lived not again till the thousand years  were ended. O, what an impression this made on my mind; I retired  to rest after an evening spent in this way; but I could not sleep.  I felt a longing desire and an inexpressible anxiety to secure to  myself a part in a resurrection so glorious. I felt a weight of  worlds,--of _eternal_ worlds resting upon me; for fear I  might still remain in uncertainty, and at last fall short and still  sleep on in the cold embrace of death; while the great, the good,  the blessed and the holy of this world would awake from the gloom  of the grave and be renovated, filled with life and joy, and enter  upon life with all its joys: while for a thousand years their busy,  happy tribes should trample on my sleeping dust, and still my  spirit wait in dread suspense, impatient of its doom. I tried to  pray; but O, how weak!    At the age of fifteen I was separated from my father's house,  and placed as an assistant on a farm, with a gentleman by the name  of William S. Herrick. This gentleman and his family were exemplary  members of the Presbyterian Church; and better, kinder, or more  agreeable people are seldom met with in this wicked world. They  treated me as if I had been an only son, instead of a hired  servant.    I was with them eight months, during which time our mutual  affection for each other increased; and I felt grieved when my time  expired and duty called me elsewhere.    During the winter following, being in the sixteenth year of my  age, I boarded with one of my aunts (my father's sister), named Van  Cott; she was an excellent and kind-hearted woman, and acted as a  mother to me. This winter I spent mostly at school, and it was my  last opportunity to improve my education by any means, except my  own unaided exertion--at least for many years.    In this school, by close application, I made such extraordinary  progress that the teacher often spoke of me to the whole school,  and exhorted them to learn as Parley Pratt did;--said he (to some  of them who were more fond of mischief than of study), if you would  learn as he does, you would become men of wisdom and talent in the  world; but if you continue the course you have done you will remain  in obscurity and unknown; while he will be known, and fill  important stations in society. I do not mention these circumstances  by way of boasting; but simply because they are true. How little  did I then realize, or even dream of the station I should be called  to fill.    Again the spring returned;--I was sixteen years of age. I left  the school of my boyhood forever, and commenced again a life of  toil. I assisted my cousin, William Pratt, in the cultivation of  the farm of my aunt (where I had boarded the previous winter) until  September, when I started a journey to the West, in company with my  brother William, in search of some spot of ground in the wilderness  which we might prepare as our future home.    We travelled about two hundred miles on foot, and at length  selected a spot for a farm in the woods, about two miles from  Oswego, a small town situated on Lake Ontario, in the State of New  York. We purchased seventy acres of land, which was covered with an  immense growth of timber, principally beech, maple and hemlock. For  this we bargained with one Mr. Morgan, and agreed to pay four  dollars per acre, in four annual payments with interest--paying  some seventy dollars in hand.    We then repaired again to the East, and, by dint of hard labor,  endeavored to earn the money. Wages were very low, and at length my  brother William entirely failed in raising his part of the money  for our next installment.    The next spring found me in the employment of a wealthy farmer,  by the name of Eliphet Bristol, in the neighborhood of my aunt Van  Cott's. Here I experienced no kindness; no friendship from my  employer or his family. I always commenced work before sunrise, and  continued till dark; losing only three days in eight months. I was  then but a lad--being only seventeen years of age--and stood in  need of fatherly and motherly care and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/449"],[0,"Pathology of Lying, Accusation, and Swindling: A Study in Forensic Psychology (#3)"],[1,"to be the only delinquency of the given  individual.  We should hesitate to deny the possibility of its  being the sole offense, but in our study of a long list of cases,  and after review of those reported by other authors, it seems  practically impossible to find a case of this.  The tendencies  soon carry the person over to the production of other  delinquencies, and if these do not come in the category of  punishable offenses, at least, through the trouble and suffering  caused others, they are to be regarded essentially as misconduct.    The reverse of the above question deserves a word or two of  attention; are there marked cases of delinquency which do not  show lying?  Surveying the figures of Ferriani[6] who enumerated  thousands of lies, belonging to his nine classes of  prevarications, which a group of 500 young offenders indulged in,  one would think that all delinquents are liars many times over.  But as a matter of fact we have been profoundly astonished to  discover that a considerable percentage of the cases we have  studied, even of repeated offenders, have proved notably  truthful.  Occasionally the very person who will engage in a  major form of delinquency will hesitate to lie.  Our experience  shows this to be less true, however, of sex delinquency than  perhaps of any other.  This statement is based on general  observations; the accurate correlations have not been worked up.  Occasionally the professional criminal of many misdeeds is proud  of his uprightness in other spheres of behavior, including  veracity.  But even here one would have to classify carefully,  for it is obvious that the typical swindler would find lying his  best cloak of disguise.  On the other hand, a bold safe-blower  may look down with scorn upon a form of criminality which demands  constant mendacity.      [6] loc. cit.        Realizing that pathological lying is a type of delinquency, and  following the rule that for explanation of conduct tendencies one  must go to youthful beginnings, we have attempted to gain the  fullest possible information about the fundamentals of  developmental and family history, early environment, and early  mental experiences.  Fortunately we have often been able to  obtain specific and probably accurate data on heredity.  The many  cases which have been only partially studied are not included.  Successive cross-section studies have been made in a number of  cases, and it has been possible to get a varying amount of  after-history.  Observational, historical, and analytical data  thus accumulated have given us a particularly favorable  opportunity for discerning the bases of this special delinquent  tendency.  The results of the various kinds of social treatment  which have been undertaken are not the least interesting of our  facts.    To enumerate the results obtained on the many mental tests given  in most cases seems quite unnecessary for the purpose of this  monograph.  We have referred to a few points of special interest  and rarely have designated the results on tests in our series.  In general, the reader probably will be better off with merely  the statement of the principal findings and of the mental  diagnosis.    Of much interest for the present subject is the development of  psychological studies of testimony or report.  Because of the  natural expectation that the pathological liar might prove to be  an unreliable witness our studies on this point will be offered  in detail.  For years we have been giving a picture memory test  on the order of one used extensively abroad.  This ``Aussage''  Test is the one described as Test VI in our monograph on  Practical Mental Classification.[7]  More recently our studies on  the psychology of testimony have led us into wider fields of  observation, and here the group of cases now under discussion may  have to stand by themselves.  The picture, the record of  testimony on which is given in some detail in our case histories,  is that of a butcher's shop with objects and actions that are  universally comprehended.  After careful and fair explanation of  what is about to be undertaken, the picture is exposed for ten  seconds, and then the examinee is asked to give a free recital of  all he saw.  When he states that no more is remembered he is  questioned on omitted details.  (All told, there are about 50  details of varying importance in the picture.)  During the  progress of this part of the examination he is asked if he saw 7  objects which might well be in a butcher shop, but which are not  in the picture.  This is the test for susceptibility to  suggestion.  All points are carefully scored.  Norms on this  test, as on many others, it seems hardly fair to give by  averages--there is much variation according to mentality and even  personality groups.  Practically all of our cases of pathological  lying range above the age of young childhood, so it is not  necessary here to discuss the characteristics of young children's  testimony.  Perhaps it is sufficient to say that the ordinary  individual recalls voluntarily or upon questioning upwards of 20  items, and does not give incorrect items to any extent.  On  questioning he may perhaps accept one or two of the seven  suggestions, but when details in general are asked for he does  not add fictional items more than are accounted for by some  little slip of memory.  One can find definite types of  intellectual honesty, even among children of 10 or 12 years of  age, when there is no tampering with the truth; if an item has  not been observed, there is no effort to make it seem otherwise.  For discussion of the results on this test among our pathological  liars we refer to our chapter on conclusions.      [7] ``Tests for Practical Mental Classification,'' by William  Healy and Grace M. Fernald, Monograph No. 54. Psychological  Review Pub. Co., 1911, Princeton University, Princeton, N. J.        The short summary of causative factors given at the end of the  case study deals only with the factors of delinquency.  To avoid  misinterpretation of the coordinated facts, what they are focused  upon should ever be remembered.  The statement of these  ascertained factors brings out many incidental points which  should be of interest to lawyers and other students of  criminalistics.    It should be needless to state to our professional readers that  the personalities represented in our case histories are entirely  fictitious, but that alterations have been made only in such  facts as will not impair scientific values.  We confess to no  particular pleasure in writing up this rather sordid material;  the task is undertaken because such studies offer the only way to  gain that better understanding which is necessary for adequate  treatment of special types of human beings.          CHAPTER II    PREVIOUS STUDIES    The subject of pathological lying was first definitely brought to  the attention of the medical and legal professions by the studies  of Delbruck.[8]  The aim of this work was to follow the  development of a symptom but little commented upon up to this  time, a symptom, as he says, found in every healthy person in  slight degree, but in some cases rising to pathological  significance and perhaps dominating the entire picture of  abnormal traits--thus becoming pathognomonic.  This symptom he at  the outset calls lying.      [8] ``Die pathologische Luge und die psychisch abnormen  Schwindler.  Eine Untersuchung Uber den allmahlichen Uebergang  eines normalen psychologischen Vorgangs in ein pathologisches  Symptom, fur Aerzte und Juristen.''  Pp. 131, Stuttgart, 1891.        Through an elaborate and exhaustive investigation of the lies  told by five patients over a period of years, he came to the  conclusion that the form of falsifying in these cases deserves a  new and separate name.  It was not ordinary lying, or delusion,  or false memory, these words express only part of the conception;  hence he coined the new term, pseudologia phantastica, to cover  the species of lying with which he was concerned.  Later German  writers have also adopted his terminology.    To emphasize the method by which he arrived at this conclusion  and to gain at the same time some knowledge of the problems he  dealt with, we may review in bare outline his case-studies.    The first patient presented by Delbruck was an Austrian  maid-servant who in her wanderings through Austria and  Switzerland had played at various times the roles of Roumanian  princess, Spaniard of royal lineage, a poor medical student, and  the rich friend of a bishop.  Her lying revealed a mixture of  imagination, boastfulness, deception, delusion, and  dissimulation.  She romanced wonderfully about her royal birth  and wrote letters purporting to be from a cardinal to herself.  She fled disguised as a man from an educational institution to  Switzerland where her sex was discovered.  It appeared that she  was subject to contrary sex feelings and thought of herself as a  man.  She was under the observation of Krafft-Ebing at one time.  He considered it at least as a case of paranoia.  Others had  determined the girl to be a psychopath who indulged in  simulations and lies.  Delbruck denominated it a case of direct  lying with a tendency to phantasies, delusions, and  dissimulations.  Delbruck from this case argues that a mixture of  lies and delusions is possible, comparing such a state with  dreaming and with the hypnotic condition in which one follows the  suggestion of the hypnotizer and is still aware of the fact.  It  was evident at times that this girl half believed her own  stories, then again that she had forgotten her former lies.  In  her, Delbruck considers perverted sex feeling and hysteria  revealed a brain organization abnormal from birth.  There was the  instinctive tendency to lie.    The second patient, an epileptic girl, had been many times  imprisoned and also sent to the Charite for examination into her  sanity before"]]]
