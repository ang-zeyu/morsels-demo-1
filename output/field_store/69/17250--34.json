In the most easterly of these, Easter Island, have been  found ruined temples and remains of great earthworks on a scale so vast  that to believe them the work of a small community of islanders is  difficult. The fact that they bear some resemblance to the buildings  and works of the ancient inhabitants of Chile and Peru has suggested  that perhaps South America was once merely a part of a great Pacific  continent. Or again, turning to the other side of the continent, it may  be argued with some show of evidence that America and Africa were once  connected by land, and that a sunken continent is to be traced between  Brazil and the Guinea coast.    Nevertheless, it appears to be impossible to say whether or not an  early branch of the human race ever 'migrated' to America. Conceivably  the race may have originated there. Some authorities suppose that the  evolution of mankind occurred at the same time and in the same fashion  in two or more distinct quarters of the globe. Others again think that  mankind evolved and spread over the surface of the world just as did  the various kinds of plants and animals. Of course, the higher  endowment of men enabled them to move with greater ease from place to  place than could beings of lesser faculties. Most writers of to-day,  however, consider this unlikely, and think it more probable that man  originated first in some one region, and spread from it throughout the  earth. But where this region was, they cannot tell. We always think of  the races of Europe as having come westward from some original home in  Asia. This is, of course, perfectly true, since nearly all the peoples  of Europe can be traced by descent from the original stock of the Aryan  family, which certainly made such a migration. But we know also that  races of men were dwelling in Europe ages before the Aryan migration.  What particular part of the globe was the first home of mankind is a  question on which we can only speculate.    Of one thing we may be certain. If there was a migration, there must  have been long ages of separation between mankind in America and  mankind in the Old World; otherwise we should still find some trace of  kinship in language which would join the natives of America to the  great racial families of Europe, Asia, and Africa. But not the  slightest vestige of such kinship has yet been found. Everybody knows  in a general way how the prehistoric relationships among the peoples of  Europe and Asia are still to be seen in the languages of to-day. The  French and Italian languages are so alike that, if we did not know it  already, we could easily guess for them a common origin. We speak of  these languages, along with others, as Romance languages, to show that  they are derived from Latin, in contrast with the closely related  tongues of the English, Dutch, and German peoples, which came from  another common stock, the Teutonic. But even the Teutonic and the  Romance languages are not entirely different. The similarity in both  groups of old root words, like the numbers from one to ten, point again  to a common origin still more remote. In this way we may trace a whole  family of languages, and with it a kinship of descent, from Hindustan  to Ireland. Similarly, another great group of tongues--Arabic, Hebrew,  etc.--shows a branch of the human family spread out from Palestine and  Egypt to Morocco.    Now when we come to inquire into the languages of the American Indians  for evidence of their relationship to other peoples we are struck with  this fact: we cannot connect the languages of America with those of any  other part of the world. This is a very notable circumstance. The  languages of Europe and Asia are, as it were, dovetailed together, and  run far and wide into Africa. From Asia eastward, through the Malay  tongues, a connection may be traced even with the speech of the Maori  of New Zealand, and with that of the remotest islanders of the Pacific.  But similar attempts to connect American languages with the outside  world break down. There are found in North America, from the Arctic to  Mexico, some fifty-five groups of languages still existing or recently  extinct. Throughout these we may trace the same affinities and  relationships that run through the languages of Europe and Asia. We can  also easily connect the speech of the natives of North America with  that of natives of Central and of South America. Even if we had not the  similarities of physical appearance, of tribal customs, and of general  manners to argue from, we should be able to say with certainty that the  various families of American Indians all belonged to one race. The  Eskimos of Northern Canada are not Indians, and are perhaps an  exception; it is possible that a connection may be traced between them  and the prehistoric cave-men of Northern Europe. But the Indians belong  to one great race, and show no connection in language or customs with  the outside world. They belong to the American continent, it has been  said, as strictly as its opossums and its armadillos, its maize and its  golden rod, or any other of its aboriginal animals and plants.    But, here again, we must not conclude too much from the fact that the  languages of America have no relation to those of Europe and Asia. This  does not show that men originated separately on this continent. For  even in Europe and Asia, where no one supposes that different races  sprung from wholly separate beginnings, we find languages isolated in  the same way. The speech of the Basques in the Pyrenees has nothing in  common with the European families of languages.    We may, however, regard the natives of America as an aboriginal race,  if any portion of mankind can be viewed as such. So far as we know,  they are not an offshoot, or a migration, from any people of what is  called the Old World, although they are, like the people of the other  continents, the descendants of a primitive human stock.    We may turn to geology to find how long mankind has lived on this  continent. In a number of places in North and South America are found  traces of human beings and their work so old that in comparison the  beginning of the world's written history becomes a thing of yesterday.  Perhaps there were men in Canada long before the shores of its lakes  had assumed their present form; long before nature had begun to hollow  out the great gorge of the Niagara river or to lay down the outline of  the present Lake Ontario. Let us look at some of the notable evidence  in respect to the age of man in America. In Nicaragua, in Central  America, the imprints of human feet have been found, deeply buried over  twenty feet below the present surface of the soil, under repeated  deposits of volcanic rock. These impressions must have been made in  soft muddy soil which was then covered by some geological convulsion  occurring long ages ago. Even more striking discoveries have been made  along the Pacific coast of South America. Near the mouth of the  Esmeraldas river in Ecuador, over a stretch of some sixty miles, the  surface soil of the coast covers a bed of marine clay. This clay is  about eight feet thick. Underneath it is a stratum of sand and loam  such as might once have itself been surface soil. In this lower bed  there are found rude implements of stone, ornaments made of gold, and  bits of broken pottery. Again, if we turn to the northern part of the  continent we find remains of the same kind, chipped implements of stone  and broken fragments of quartz buried in the drift of the Mississippi  and Missouri valleys. These have sometimes been found lying beside or  under the bones of elephants and animals unknown in North America since  the period of the Great Ice. Not many years ago, some men engaged in  digging a well on a hillside that was once part of the beach of Lake  Ontario, came across the remains of a primitive hearth buried under the  accumulated soil. From its situation we can only conclude that the men  who set together the stones of the hearth, and lighted on it their  fires, did so when the vast wall of the northern glacier was only  beginning to retreat, and long before the gorge of Niagara had begun to  be furrowed out of the rock.    Many things point to the conclusion that there were men in North and  South America during the remote changes of the Great Ice Age. But how  far the antiquity of man on this continent reaches back into the  preceding ages we cannot say.        CHAPTER III    THE ABORIGINES OF CANADA    Of the uncounted centuries of the history of the red man in America  before the coming of the Europeans we know very little indeed. Very few  of the tribes possessed even a primitive art of writing. It is true  that the Aztecs of Mexico, and the ancient Toltecs who preceded them,  understood how to write in pictures, and that, by this means, they  preserved some record of their rulers and of the great events of their  past. The same is true of the Mayas of Central America, whose ruined  temples are still to be traced in the tangled forests of Yucatan and  Guatemala. The ancient Peruvians also had a system, not exactly of  writing, but of record by means of QUIPUS or twisted woollen cords of  different colours: it is through such records that we have some  knowledge of Peruvian history during about a hundred years before the  coming of the Spaniards, and some traditions reaching still further  back. But nowhere was the art of writing sufficiently developed in  America to give us a real history of the thoughts and deeds of its  people before the arrival of Columbus.    This is especially true of those families of the great red race which  inhabited what is now Canada. They spent a primitive existence, living  thinly scattered along the sea-coast, and in the forests and open  glades of the district of the Great Lakes, or wandering over"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4075"],[0,"The Intrusion of Jimmy (#3)"],[1,"boys  together. Tell me about this girl--the girl you loved, and were  idiot enough to lose.\"    Jimmy drew a deep breath.    \"Very well,\" said Mifflin complacently, \"sigh if you like; it's  better than nothing.\"    Jimmy sat up.    \"Yes, dozens of times,\" said Mifflin.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"You were just going to ask me if I had ever been in love, weren't  you?\"    \"I wasn't, because I know you haven't. You have no soul. You don't  know what love is.\"    \"Have it your own way,\" said Mifflin, resignedly.    Jimmy bumped back on the sofa.    \"I don't either,\" he said. \"That's the trouble.\"    Mifflin looked interested.    \"I know,\" he said. \"You've got that strange premonitory fluttering,  when the heart seems to thrill within you like some baby bird  singing its first song, when--\"    \"Oh, cut it out!\"    \"--when you ask yourself timidly, 'Is it? Can it really be?' and  answer shyly, 'No. Yes. I believe it is!' I've been through it  dozens of times; it is a recognized early symptom. Unless prompt  measures are taken, it will develop into something acute. In these  matters, stand on your Uncle Arthur. He knows.\"    \"You make me sick,\" Jimmy retorted.    \"You have our ear,\" said Mifflin, kindly. \"Tell me all.\"    \"There's nothing to tell.\"    \"Don't lie, James.\"    \"Well, practically nothing.\"    \"That's better.\"    \"It was like this.\"    \"Good.\"    Jimmy wriggled himself into a more comfortable position, and took a  sip from his glass.    \"I didn't see her until the second day out.\"    \"I know that second day out. Well?\"    \"We didn't really meet at all.\"    \"Just happened to be going to the same spot, eh?\"    \"As a matter of fact, it was like this. Like a fool, I'd bought a  second-class ticket.\"    \"What? Our young Rockerbilt Astergould, the boy millionaire,  traveling second-class! Why?\"    \"I had an idea it would be better fun. Everybody's so much more  cheery in the second cabin. You get to know people so much quicker.  Nine trips out of ten, I'd much rather go second.\"    \"And this was the tenth?\"    \"She was in the first-cabin,\" said Jimmy.    Mifflin clutched his forehead.    \"Wait!\" he cried. \"This reminds me of something--something in  Shakespeare. Romeo and Juliet? No. I've got it--Pyramus and Thisbe.\"    \"I don't see the slightest resemblance.\"    \"Read your 'Midsummer Night's Dream.' 'Pyramus and Thisbe,' says the  story, 'did talk through the chink of a wall,'\" quoted Mifflin.    \"We didn't.\"    \"Don't be so literal. You talked across a railing.\"    \"We didn't.\"    \"Do you mean to say you didn't talk at all?\"    \"We didn't say a single word.\"    Mifflin shook his head sadly.    \"I give you up,\" he said. \"I thought you were a man of enterprise.  What did you do?\"    Jimmy sighed softly.    \"I used to stand and smoke against the railing opposite the barber's  shop, and she used to walk round the deck.\"    \"And you used to stare at her?\"    \"I would look in her direction sometimes,\" corrected Jimmy, with  dignity.    \"Don't quibble! You stared at her. You behaved like a common rubber-neck,  and you know it. I am no prude, James, but I feel compelled to  say that I consider your conduct that of a libertine. Used she to  walk alone?\"    \"Generally.\"    \"And, now, you love her, eh? You went on board that ship happy,  careless, heart-free. You came off it grave and saddened.  Thenceforth, for you, the world could contain but one woman, and  her you had lost.\"    Mifflin groaned in a hollow and bereaved manner, and took a sip from  his glass to buoy him up.    Jimmy moved restlessly on the sofa.    \"Do you believe in love at first sight?\" he asked, fatuously. He was  in the mood when a man says things, the memory of which makes him  wake up hot all over for nights to come.    \"I don't see what first sight's got to do with it,\" said Mifflin.  \"According to your own statement, you stood and glared at the girl  for five days without letting up for a moment. I can quite imagine  that you might glare yourself into love with anyone by the end of  that time.\"    \"I can't see myself settling down,\" said Jimmy, thoughtfully. \"And,  until you feel that you want to settle down, I suppose you can't be  really in love.\"    \"I was saying practically that about you at the club just before you  came in. My somewhat neat expression was that you were one of the  gypsies of the world.\"    \"By George, you're quite right!\"    \"I always am.\"    \"I suppose it's having nothing to do. When I was on the News, I was  never like this.\"    \"You weren't on the News long enough to get tired of it.\"    \"I feel now I can't stay in a place more than a week. It's having  this money that does it, I suppose.\"    \"New York,\" said Mifflin, \"is full of obliging persons who will be  delighted to relieve you of the incubus. Well, James, I shall leave  you. I feel more like bed now. By the way, I suppose you lost sight  of this girl when you landed?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, there aren't so many girls in the United States--only twenty  million. Or is it forty million? Something small. All you've got to  do is to search around a bit. Good-night.\"    \"Good-night.\"    Mr. Mifflin clattered down the stairs. A minute later, the sound of  his name being called loudly from the street brought Jimmy to the  window. Mifflin was standing on the pavement below, looking up.    \"Jimmy.\"    \"What's the matter now?\"    \"I forgot to ask. Was she a blonde?\"    \"What?\"    \"Was she a blonde?\" yelled Mifflin.    \"No,\" snapped Jimmy.    \"Dark, eh?\" bawled Mifflin, making night hideous.    \"Yes,\" said Jimmy, shutting the window.    \"Jimmy!\"    The window went up again.    \"Well?\"    \"Me for blondes!\"    \"Go to bed!\"    \"Very well. Good-night.\"    \"Good-night.\"    Jimmy withdrew his head, and sat down in the chair Mifflin had  vacated. A moment later, he rose, and switched off the light. It was  pleasanter to sit and think in the dark. His thoughts wandered off  in many channels, but always came back to the girl on the Lusitania.  It was absurd, of course. He didn't wonder that Arthur Mifflin had  treated the thing as a joke. Good old Arthur! Glad he had made a  success! But was it a joke? Who was it that said, the point of a  joke is like the point of a needle, so small that it is apt to  disappear entirely when directed straight at oneself? If anybody  else had told him such a limping romance, he would have laughed  himself. Only, when you are the center of a romance, however  limping, you see it from a different angle. Of course, told badly,  it was absurd. He could see that. But something away at the back of  his mind told him that it was not altogether absurd. And yet--love  didn't come like that, in a flash. You might just as well expect a  house to spring into being in a moment, or a ship, or an automobile,  or a table, or a--He sat up with a jerk. In another instant, he  would have been asleep.    He thought of bed, but bed seemed a long way off--the deuce of a  way. Acres of carpet to be crawled over, and then the dickens of a  climb at the end of it. Besides, undressing! Nuisance--undressing.  That was a nice dress the girl had worn on the fourth day out.  Tailor-made. He liked tailor-mades. He liked all her dresses. He  liked her. Had she liked him? So hard to tell if you don't get a  chance of speaking! She was dark. Arthur liked blondes, Arthur was a  fool! Good old Arthur! Glad he had made a success! Now, he could  marry if he liked! If he wasn't so restless, if he didn't feel that  he couldn't stop more than a day in any place! But would the girl  have him? If they had never spoken, it made it so hard to--    At this point, Jimmy went to sleep.          CHAPTER III    MR. McEACHERN      At about the time when Jimmy's meditations finally merged themselves  in dreams, a certain Mr. John McEachern, Captain of Police, was  seated in the parlor of his up-town villa, reading. He was a man  built on a large scale. Everything about him was large--his hands,  his feet, his shoulders, his chest, and particularly his jaw, which  even in his moments of calm was aggressive, and which stood out,  when anything happened to ruffle him, like the ram of a battle-ship.  In his patrolman days, which had been passed mainly on the East  side, this jaw of his had acquired a reputation from Park Row to  Fourteenth Street. No gang-fight, however absorbing, could retain  the undivided attention of the young blood of the Bowery when Mr.  McEachern's jaw hove in sight with the rest of his massive person in  close attendance. He was a man who knew no fear, and he had gone  through disorderly mobs like an east wind.    But there was another side to his character. In fact, that other  side was so large that the rest of him, his readiness in combat and  his zeal in breaking up public disturbances, might be said to have  been only an off-shoot. For his ambition was as large as his fist  and as aggressive as his jaw. He had entered the force with the  single idea of becoming rich, and had set about achieving his object  with a strenuous vigor that was as irresistible as his mighty  locust-stick. Some policemen are born grafters, some achieve graft,  and some have graft thrust upon them. Mr. McEachern had begun by  being the first, had risen to the second, and for some years now had  been a prominent member of the small and hugely prosperous third  class, the class that does not go out seeking graft, but sits at  home and lets graft come to it.    In his search for wealth, he had been content to abide his time. He  did not want the trifling sum that every New York policeman  acquires. His object was something bigger, and he was prepared to  wait for it. He knew that small beginnings were an annoying but  unavoidable preliminary to all great fortunes. Probably, Captain  Kidd had started in a small way. Certainly, Mr. Rockefeller had. He  was content to follow in the footsteps of the masters.    A patrolman's opportunities of amassing wealth are not great. Mr.  McEachern had"]]]
