The blind mouse was speedily deserted by her two sisters, who went off  to hunt flies, but as she wandered sadly along the shore she found a  dead fish, and was eating it, when she felt something very hard. At her  cries the other two mice ran up.    \"It is the bronze ring! It is the talisman!\" they cried joyfully, and,  getting into their boat again, they soon reached the mouse island. It  was time they did, for the captain was just going to land his cargo of  cats, when a deputation of mice brought him the precious bronze ring.    \"Bronze ring,\" commanded the young man, \"obey thy master. Let my ship  appear as it was before.\"    Immediately the genii of the ring set to work, and the old black vessel  became once more the wonderful golden ship with sails of brocade; the  handsome sailors ran to the silver masts and the silken ropes, and very  soon they set sail for the capital.    Ah! how merrily the sailors sang as they flew over the glassy sea!    At last the port was reached.    The captain landed and ran to the palace, where he found the wicked  old man asleep.

Carnoy et Nicolaides.  Paris: Maisonneuve, 1889.          PRINCE HYACINTH AND THE DEAR LITTLE PRINCESS      Once upon a time there lived a king who was deeply in love with a  princess, but she could not marry anyone, because she was under an  enchantment. So the King set out to seek a fairy, and asked what he  could do to win the Princess's love. The Fairy said to him:    \"You know that the Princess has a great cat which she is very fond of.  Whoever is clever enough to tread on that cat's tail is the man she is  destined to marry.\"    The King said to himself that this would not be very difficult, and he  left the Fairy, determined to grind the cat's tail to powder rather than  not tread on it at all.    You may imagine that it was not long before he went to see the Princess,  and puss, as usual, marched in before him, arching his back. The King  took a long step, and quite thought he had the tail under his foot, but  the cat turned round so sharply that he only trod on air. And so it went  on for eight days, till the King began to think that this fatal tail  must be full of quicksilver--it was never still for a moment.    At last, however, he was lucky enough to come upon puss fast asleep and  with his tail conveniently spread out. So the King, without losing a  moment, set his foot upon it heavily.    With one terrific yell the cat sprang up and instantly changed into a  tall man, who, fixing his angry eyes upon the King, said:    \"You shall marry the Princess because you have been able to break the  enchantment, but I will have my revenge. You shall have a son, who will  never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long, and if you  ever tell anyone what I have just said to you, you shall vanish away  instantly, and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again.\"    Though the King was horribly afraid of the enchanter, he could not help  laughing at this threat.    \"If my son has such a long nose as that,\" he said to himself, \"he  must always see it or feel it; at least, if he is not blind or without  hands.\"    But, as the enchanter had vanished, he did not waste any more time in  thinking, but went to seek the Princess, who very soon consented to  marry him. But after all, they had not been married very long when the  King died, and the Queen had nothing left to care for but her little  son, who was called Hyacinth. The little Prince had large blue eyes, the  prettiest eyes in the world, and a sweet little mouth, but, alas!  his nose was so enormous that it covered half his face. The Queen was  inconsolable when she saw this great nose, but her ladies assured her  that it was not really as large as it looked; that it was a Roman nose,  and you had only to open any history to see that every hero has a large  nose. The Queen, who was devoted to her baby, was pleased with what they  told her, and when she looked at Hyacinth again, his nose certainly did  not seem to her _quite_ so large.    The Prince was brought up with great care; and, as soon as he could  speak, they told him all sorts of dreadful stories about people who had  short noses. No one was allowed to come near him whose nose did not more  or less resemble his own, and the courtiers, to get into favor with the  Queen, took to pulling their babies' noses several times every day  to make them grow long. But, do what they would, they were nothing by  comparison with the Prince's.    When he grew sensible he learned history; and whenever any great prince  or beautiful princess was spoken of, his teachers took care to tell him  that they had long noses.    His room was hung with pictures, all of people with very large noses;  and the Prince grew up so convinced that a long nose was a great beauty,  that he would not on any account have had his own a single inch shorter!    When his twentieth birthday was passed the Queen thought it was time  that he should be married, so she commanded that the portraits of  several princesses should be brought for him to see, and among the  others was a picture of the Dear Little Princess!    Now, she was the daughter of a great king, and would some day possess  several kingdoms herself; but Prince Hyacinth had not a thought to spare  for anything of that sort, he was so much struck with her beauty. The  Princess, whom he thought quite charming, had, however, a little saucy  nose, which, in her face, was the prettiest thing possible, but it was  a cause of great embarrassment to the courtiers, who had got into such  a habit of laughing at little noses that they sometimes found themselves  laughing at hers before they had time to think; but this did not do at  all before the Prince, who quite failed to see the joke, and actually  banished two of his courtiers who had dared to mention disrespectfully  the Dear Little Princess's tiny nose!    The others, taking warning from this, learned to think twice before they  spoke, and one even went so far as to tell the Prince that, though it  was quite true that no man could be worth anything unless he had a  long nose, still, a woman's beauty was a different thing; and he knew  a learned man who understood Greek and had read in some old manuscripts  that the beautiful Cleopatra herself had a \"tip-tilted\" nose!    The Prince made him a splendid present as a reward for this good  news, and at once sent ambassadors to ask the Dear Little Princess in  marriage. The King, her father, gave his consent; and Prince Hyacinth,  who, in his anxiety to see the Princess, had gone three leagues to meet  her was just advancing to kiss her hand when, to the horror of all who  stood by, the enchanter appeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning,  and, snatching up the Dear Little Princess, whirled her away out of  their sight!    The Prince was left quite unconsolable, and declared that nothing should  induce him to go back to his kingdom until he had found her again, and  refusing to allow any of his courtiers to follow him, he mounted his  horse and rode sadly away, letting the animal choose his own path.    So it happened that he came presently to a great plain, across which  he rode all day long without seeing a single house, and horse and rider  were terribly hungry, when, as the night fell, the Prince caught sight  of a light, which seemed to shine from a cavern.    He rode up to it, and saw a little old woman, who appeared to be at  least a hundred years old.    She put on her spectacles to look at Prince Hyacinth, but it was quite  a long time before she could fix them securely because her nose was so  very short.    The Prince and the Fairy (for that was who she was) had no sooner looked  at one another than they went into fits of laughter, and cried at the  same moment, \"Oh, what a funny nose!\"    \"Not so funny as your own,\" said Prince Hyacinth to the Fairy; \"but,  madam, I beg you to leave the consideration of our noses--such as  they are--and to be good enough to give me something to eat, for I am  starving, and so is my poor horse.\"    \"With all my heart,\" said the Fairy. \"Though your nose is so ridiculous  you are, nevertheless, the son of my best friend. I loved your father as  if he had been my brother. Now _he_ had a very handsome nose!\"    \"And pray what does mine lack?\" said the Prince.    \"Oh! it doesn't _lack_ anything,\" replied the Fairy. \"On the contrary  quite, there is only too much of it. But never mind, one may be a very  worthy man though his nose is too long. I was telling you that I was  your father's friend; he often came to see me in the old times, and you  must know that I was very pretty in those days; at least, he used to say  so. I should like to tell you of a conversation we had the last time I  ever saw him.\"    \"Indeed,\" said the Prince, \"when I have supped it will give me the  greatest pleasure to hear it; but consider, madam, I beg of you, that I  have had nothing to eat to-day.\"    \"The poor boy is right,\" said the Fairy; \"I was forgetting. Come in,  then, and I will give you some supper, and while you are eating I can  tell you my story in a very few words--for I don't like endless tales  myself. Too long a tongue is worse than too long a nose, and I remember  when I was young that I was so much admired for not being a great  chatterer.

Nauvoo is situated just at the head of what are usually called the  Des Moines Rapids, about one hundred and ninety miles above St.  Louis. These rapids were a serious obstacle to the navigation of the  Mississippi at this point, in an early day, as in the season of low  water they could not be passed by the steamboats plying the river.  This difficulty of late, however, has been obviated by the general  government building a fine canal, running parallel with the west bank  of the river, from Keokuk to Montrose, a distance of twelve or fifteen  miles. I was unable to learn the cost of the construction, but judge it  must have required at least several millions of dollars.    Such is the location of Nauvoo; such its immediate surroundings. It  now remains for me to relate the events which led to the establishment  of a thriving city on the site we have briefly described; how it was  converted from a sickly wilderness to the most desirable section of the  great State of Illinois; and then how, through acts of injustice and  treachery, some of its principal founders were murdered and the rest  of its inhabitants cruelly driven from the city by mob violence into  the wilderness; and how the city sank from its prosperous condition,  to become the semi-desolate place it is today; and, what is of more  importance, to trace the development of that faith taught by Joseph  Smith, which is destined to become, and indeed now is, one of the  world's great religions.

THE RECEPTION OF THE EXILES IN ILLINOIS.    IN what is properly a companion volume to this--\"The Missouri  Persecutions\"--I have told how the Latter-day Saints were driven from  Missouri under a threat of extermination from the executive of that  State, Lilburn W. Boggs. When fleeing from Missouri, where they had  suffered so much from mob violence, and from the State government  officials, the Mormon exiles crossed the Mississippi into the State of  Illinois, at the point near where the city of Quincy is located--in  fact, at the Quincy Ferry. Their destitute condition, together with  the injustice they had suffered in Missouri--the spectacle of a people  in free America being driven from their homes and exiled from one of  the States of the American Union because of religious beliefs--aroused  the indignation and excited the sympathy of the people of Quincy and  vicinity. A kind reception was given to the exiles by the people of  this section of Illinois, one very similar to that given to many of the  same people by the inhabitants of Clay County, when a cruel persecution  had driven some twelve hundred of them from their homes in Jackson  County, Missouri, five years before. [1] The Democratic Association of  Quincy was especially active in the interests of the exiles. In the  month of February a meeting was called by this association to inquire  into the situation of the Mormon exiles. At this first meeting all that  was done was to pass a resolution, to the effect that the people called  Latter-day Saints were in a situation requiring the aid of the people  of Quincy. A committee of eight was appointed to call a general meeting  of both citizens and Mormons, and to receive a statement from the  latter of their condition, with a view to relieving their necessities.  The committee was instructed to get the Congregational church in  which to hold the next meeting, but the directors having in charge  that building would not allow it to be used for that purpose. I speak  of this to show the kind of charity existing in the breasts of some  pretended followers of Him who taught that charity was the crowning  virtue. Failing to secure the church, the second meeting was held in  the courthouse.    At this meeting the special committee appointed at the first meeting  reported its labors. The committee had received statements from Sidney  Rigdon and others in relation to the expulsion of the Mormons from  Missouri, and suggested a series of resolutions setting forth that the  exiled strangers were entitled to the sympathy and aid of the people of  Quincy;    That a numerous committee, composed of individuals from every part  of the town, be appointed to allay the prejudices of the misguided  citizens of Quincy, and explain that it was not the design of the  exiled Saints to lower the wages of the laboring classes, but to secure  something to save them from starvation;    That a standing committee be appointed to relieve, so far as in their  power, the wants of the destitute and homeless; and to use their utmost  endeavors to procure employment for those who were able and willing to  labor.    The report closed by saying:--        We recommend to all the citizens of Quincy that in all their      intercourse with the strangers, they use and observe a becoming      decorum and delicacy, and be particularly careful not to indulge in      any conversation or expression calculated to wound their feelings,      or in any way to reflect upon those who, by every law of humanity,      are entitled to our sympathy and commiseration.    This good work begun by the Democratic Association was continued by  them, and substantial assistance was given to the suffering Saints  through their exertions. At a subsequent meeting of the association the  following resolutions were adopted:        That we regard the right of conscience as natural and inalienable,      and the most sacredly guaranteed by the Constitution of our free      government;        That we regard the acts of all mobs in violation of law; and those      who compose them individually responsible, both to the laws of God      and man, for every depredation committed upon the property, rights,      or life of any citizen;        That the inhabitants upon the western frontier of the State of      Missouri, in their late persecution of the people denominated      Mormons, have violated the sacred rights of conscience and every      law of justice and humanity;        That the governor of Missouri, in refusing protection to this class      of people, when pressed upon by a heartless mob, and turning upon      them a band of unprincipled militia, with orders encouraging their      extermination, has brought a lasting disgrace upon the State over      which he presides.    Thus with expressions of sympathy and material aid did the people of  Quincy assist the exiles and bid them hope for better days. Nor was  this kindly feeling confined to the people of Quincy and vicinity;  it extended throughout the State; and especially was it exhibited by  some of the leading men thereof, including Governor Carlin, Stephen A.  Douglas, Dr. Isaac Galland and many others.    Footnotes    1. Missouri Persecutions, Chapter xiv.        CHAPTER III.    COMMERCE--LAND PURCHASES.    IN the fall of 1838 a brother by the name of Israel Barlow left the  State of Missouri under the exterminating order of Governor Boggs. By  missing his way, or, what is more likely, directed by the hand of a  kind Providence, he did not leave the State by the same route as the  great body of his people, but taking a northeasterly course, struck the  Des Moines River a short distance above its mouth, in the Territory of  Iowa. He was without food and destitute of clothing. Making his wants  known to the people living in that locality, they kindly supplied him  with food and raiment. To them he related the story of the persecution  of the Latter-day Saints in Missouri, and how his people, poor and  destitute as himself, were fleeing from the State _en masse_. His  relation of the sufferings of the Saints, and the cruelties heaped  upon them by their heartless persecutors, enlisted the sympathies of  his hearers, and they gave him letters of introduction to several  gentlemen, among which was one to Dr. Isaac Galland, a gentleman of  some influence living at Commerce, a small settlement on the banks of  the Mississippi, in Illinois, and which afterward became the site of  Nauvoo.    Dr. Galland owned considerable land in Commerce, and he wrote the  Saints located in Quincy that several farms could doubtless be rented  in his locality, and that perhaps some fifty families could be  accommodated at Commerce. In addition to this offer of lands made to  The Church, another and a previous one had been made of twenty thousand  acres, between the Des Moines and the Mississippi rivers. This tract  could have been purchased at two dollars per acre, to be paid in twenty  annual payments without interest. A conference was convened at Quincy  in February, and the advisability of making the purchase and settling  the Saints in a body came up for consideration. It was decided by the  conference that it was not advisable to locate lands at that time.    Subsequently, however, on the ninth day of March, the Saints having  received further offers of land in Illinois and Iowa, called another  public meeting and appointed a committee to go and examine the lands  offered. In Iowa, the people and officers of the Territory expressed a  kindly feeling toward the exiled Saints. The governor of Iowa--Robert  Lucas--had known the Saints in Ohio, and testified to Dr. Galland that  the Mormon people, when they were in Ohio, were good citizens, and he  respected them as such now, and would treat them accordingly, should  they, or any part of them, decide to settle in his Territory. The  statement is made in answer to a letter of inquiry on the subject of  the Mormons settling in Iowa. He wrote to Dr. Isaac Galland as follows:                                       EXECUTIVE OFFICE, IOWA, BURLINGTON"]]]
