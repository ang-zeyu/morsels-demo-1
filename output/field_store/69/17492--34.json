A fine precaution, considering that we are  direct from New York! After breakfast, I went to the mole, to see the  Consular Agent, on duty. While waiting in our boat, we were stared at by  thirty or forty loafers (a Yankee phrase, but strictly applicable to these  foreign vagabonds), of the most wretched kind. Some were dressed in coarse  shirts and trowsers, and some had only one of these habiliments. None  interested me, except a dirty, swarthy boy, with most brilliant black  eyes, who lay flat on his stomach, and gazed at us in silence. His  elf-like glance sparkles brightly in my memory.    One of the seamen in our boat spoke to the persons on shore in Spanish. I  inquired whether that were his mother-tongue, and learned that he was a  native of Mahon. On questioning him further, I ascertained that he was  concerned in a tragedy of which I had often heard, while on the  Mediterranean station, two or three years ago. A beautiful girl of  sixteen, of highly respectable family, fell in love with a young man, her  inferior in social rank, though of reputable standing. The affair was kept  secret between them. At length, the lover became jealous, and, one  evening, called his mistress out of her father's house, and stabbed her  five or six times. She died instantly, and her murderer fled. It was  believed in Mahon that he was drowned by falling overboard from the vessel  in which he escaped. Nevertheless, that murderer was the man with whom I  was speaking in the boat, now bearing another name, and a common sailor of  our ship. He told me his real name; and I heard, afterwards, that, when  drunk, he had confessed the murder to one of his messmates.    This incident illustrates what I have often thought, that the private  history of a man-of-war's crew, if truly told, would be full of high  romance, varied with stirring incident, and too often darkened with, deep  and deadly crime. Many go to sea with the old Robinson Crusoe spirit,  seeking adventure for its own sake; many, to escape the punishment of  guilt, which has made them outlaws of the land; some, to drown the memory  of slighted love; while others flee from the wreck of their broken  fortunes ashore, to hazard another shipwreck on the deep. The jacket of  the common sailor often covers a figure that has walked Broadway in a  fashionable coat. An officer sometimes sees his old school-fellow and  playmate taken to the gangway and flogged. Many a blackguard on board has  been bred in luxury; and many a good seaman has been a slaver and a  pirate. It is well for the ship's company, that the sins of individuals do  not, as in the days of Jonas, stir up tempests that threaten the  destruction of the whole.    The island of Grand Canary is one of the most interesting of the group at  which we have now arrived. The population of its capital, the city of Las  Palmas, is variously estimated at from nine thousand inhabitants, to twice  that number. The streets, however, have none of the bustle and animation  that would enliven an American town, of similar size. Around the city  there is an aspect of great fertility; fields of corn and grain,  palm-trees, and vineyards, occupy the valleys among the hills, and extend  along the shores, twining a glad green wreath about the circuit of the  island. The vines of Canary produce a wine which, two or three centuries  ago, was held in higher estimation than at present, and is supposed by  some to have been the veritable \"sack\" that so continually moistened the  throat of Falstaff. The very name of Canary is a cheerful one, associated  as it is with the idea of bounteous vineyards, and of those little golden  birds that make music all over the world.    The high hills that surround the city of Las Palmas are composed of soft  stone, the yielding quality of which has caused these cliffs to be  converted to a very singular purpose. The poorer people, who can find no  shelter above ground, burrow into the sides of the hill, and thus form  caves for permanent habitation, where they dwell like swallows in a  sand-bank. Judging from the number of these excavations, the mouths of  which appear on the hill-sides, there cannot be less than a thousand  persons living in the manner here described. Not only the destitute  inhabitants of Grand Canary, but vagabonds from Teneriffe and the other  islands, creep thus into the heart of the rock; and children play about  the entrances of the caverns as merrily as at a cottage-door: while, in  the gloom of the interior, you catch a glimpse of household furniture, and  women engaged in domestic avocations. It is like discovering a world  within the world.          CHAPTER II.    Nelson's defeat at Santa Cruz--The Mantilla--Arrival at Porto  Grande--Poverty of the inhabitants--Portuguese Exiles at the Cape de  Verds--City of Porto Prayo--Author's submersion--Green Turtle--Rainy  Season--Anchor at Cape Mesurado.      _July_ 1.--Ashore at Santa Cruz. The population of the city is reckoned  at six or eight thousand. The streets are clean, and the houses built in  the Spanish fashion. Camels are frequent in the streets.    The landing at the Mole is generally bad, as Nelson found to his cost. It  is easy to perceive that, even in ordinary times, the landing of a large  party, though unopposed, must be a work of considerable difficulty. How  much more arduous, then, was the enterprise of the great Naval Hero, who  made his attack in darkness, and in the face of a well-manned battery,  which swept away all who gained foot-hold on the shore! The latter  obstacle might have been overcome by English valor, under Nelson's  guidance; but night, and the heavy surf, were the enemies that gave him  his first and only defeat. The little fort, under whose guns he was  carried by his step-son, after the loss of his arm, derived its chief  interest, in my eyes, from that circumstance. The glory of the great  Admiral sheds a lustre even upon the spot where success deserted him. In  the Cathedral of Santa Cruz are to be seen two English flags, which were  taken on that occasion, and are still pointed out with pride by the  inhabitants. I saw them five years ago, when they hung from the walls,  tattered and covered with dust; they are now enclosed in glass cases, to  which the stranger's attention is eagerly directed by the boys who swarm  around him. The defeat of Nelson took place on the anniversary of the  patron-saint of Santa Cruz; a coincidence which has added not a little to  the saint's reputation. It was by no means his first warlike exploit; for  he is said to have come to the assistance of the inhabitants, and routed  the Moors, when pressing the city hard, in the olden time.    We wandered about the city until evening, and then walked in the Plaza.  Here the ladies and gentlemen of the city promenade for an hour or two,  occasionally seating themselves on the stone benches which skirt the  square. Like other Spanish ladies, the lovely brunettes of Santa Cruz  generally wear the mantilla, so much more becoming than the bonnet. There  are just enough of bonnets worn by foreigners, and travelled Spanish  dames, to show what deformities they are, when contrasted with the  graceful veil. This head-dress could only be used in a climate like that  of Teneriffe, where there are no extremes of heat or cold. It is a proverb  that there is no winter and no summer here. So equable and moderate is the  temperature, that, we were assured, a person might, without inconvenience,  wear either thick or thin clothing, all the year round. With such a  climate, and with a fertile soil, it would seem that this must be almost a  Paradise. There is a great obstruction, however, to the welfare of the  inhabitants, in the want of water. It rains so seldom that the ground is  almost burnt up, and many cattle actually perish from thirst. It is said  that no less than thirty thousand persons have emigrated from the island,  within three years.    The productions of Teneriffe, for export, are wine and barilla. Of the  first, the greater part is sent to England, Russia and the United States.  About thirty thousand pipes are made annually, of which two thirds are  exported. Little or no wine is produced on the southern slope of the  island. The hills around Santa Cruz are little more than rugged peaks of  naked rock. The scenery is wild and bold, but sterile; and scattered  around are stupendous hills of lava, the products of former volcanic  eruptions, but which have, for ages, been cold and wave-washed.    14.--Arrived at Porto Grande, in the island of St. Vincent's, one of the  Cape de Verds. The harbor is completely landlocked by the island of St.  Antonio, which stretches across its mouth. Still, there is, at times, a  considerable swell. The appearance of the land is barren, desolate, and  unpromising in the highest degree; and the town is in keeping with the  scenery. Eighty or ninety miserable hovels, constructed of small, loose  stones, in the manner of our stone-fences, stand in rows, with some  pretence of regularity. Besides the Governor and his aid, there are here  five white men, or rather Portuguese (for their claim to white blood is  not apparent in their complexions), viz. the Collector, the American  Consular Agent, a shop-keeper, whose goods are all contained in a couple  of trunks, and two private soldiers. We called to see the Governor, and  were politely received; he offered seats, and did the honors of the place  with dignity and affability. His pay is one dollar per diem. He has five  soldiers under his command, two of them Portuguese, and three native  negroes, one of whom has a crooked leg.    The people here are wretchedly poor, subsisting chiefly by fishing, and by  their precarious gains from ships which anchor in the port. The Collector  informed me that there had been sixty whale-ships in the harbor, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7947"],[0,"The Diary of a U-boat Commander (#3)"],[1,"there are thousands who slept their last  sleep in the wrecked hulls of the battle cruisers which will rust for  eternal ages upon the Jutland banks.    Sad as our losses are--and the gallant _Lutzow_ has sunk in sight of  home--I am filled with pride.    We have met that great armada the British Fleet, we have struck them  with a hammer blow and we have returned. I was asleep in my cabin when  the news came that Hipper was coming south with the British battle  cruisers on his beam. In five minutes we were at our action stations.  We made contact with Hipper at 5.30 p.m., [1] and Beatty turned north  with his cruisers and fast battleships and we pursued.    [Footnote 1: This is 4.30 G.M.T.--Etienne]    Two of the great ships had been sunk by our battle cruisers, and we had  hopes of destroying the remainder, when at 6.55 the mist on the  northern horizon was pierced by the formidable line of the British  Battle Fleet.    Jellicoe had arrived!    Three battle cruisers became involved between the lines, and in an  instant one was blown up, and another crawled west in a sinking  condition. Sudden and terrible are events in a modern sea-battle.    Confronted with the concentrated force of Britain's Battle Fleet we  turned to east, and for twenty minutes our High Seas Fleet sustained  the unequal contest.    It was during this period that we were hit seventeen times by heavy  shell, though, in my position in the after torpedo control tower, I  only realized one hit had taken place, which was when a shell plunged  into the after turret and, blowing the roof off, killed every member of  the turret's crew.    From my position, when the smoke and dust had blown away, I looked down  into a mass of twisted machinery, amongst which I seemed to detect the  charred remains of bodies.    At about 7.40 we turned, under cover of our smoke screen, and steered  south-west.    Our position was not satisfactory, as the last information of the enemy  reported them as turning to the southward; consequently they were  between us and Heligoland.    At 11 p.m. we received a signal for divisions of battle fleets to steer  independently for the Horn Reef swept channel.    Ten minutes later we underwent the first of five destroyer attacks.    The British destroyers, searching wide in the night, had located us,  and with desperate gallantry pressed home the attack again and again.  So close did they come that about 1.30 a.m. we rammed one, passing  through her like a knife through a cheese.    It was a wonderful spectacle to see those sinister craft, rushing madly  to their destruction down the bright beam of our powerful searchlights.  It was an avenue of death for them, but to the credit of their Service  it must stand that throughout the long nightmare they did not hesitate.    The surrounding darkness seemed to vomit forth flotilla after flotilla  of these cavalry of the sea.    And they struck us once, a torpedo right forward, which will keep us in  dock for a month, but did no vital injury.    When morning dawned, misty and soft, as is its way in June in the  Bight, we were to the eastward of the British, and so we came  honourably home to Wilhelmshaven, feeling that the young Navy had laid  worthy foundations for its tradition to grow upon.    We are to report at Kiel, and shall be six weeks upon the job.          _Frankfurt_.      Back on seventeen days' leave, and everyone here very anxious to hear  details of the battle of Skajerack.    It is very pleasant to have something to talk to the women about.  Usually the gallant field greys hold the drawing-room floor, with their  startling tales from the Western Front, of how they nearly took Verdun,  and would have if the British hadn't insisted on being slaughtered on  the Somme.    It is quite impossible in many ways to tell that there is a war on as  far as social life in this place is concerned.    There is a shortage of good coffee and that is about all.           *       *       *       *       *    Arrived back on board last night.    They have made a fine job of us, and we go through the canal to the  Schillig Roads early next week.    We are to do three weeks' gunnery practices from there, to train the  new drafts.        1916 (_about August_).    At last! Thank Heavens, my application has been granted. Schmitt (the  Secretary) told me this morning that a letter has come from the  Admiralty to say that I am to present myself for medical examination at  the board at Wilhelmshaven to-morrow.    What joy! to strike a blow at last, finished for ever the cursed  monotony of inactivity of this High Seas Fleet life. But the U-boat  war! Ah! that goes well. We shall bring those stubborn, blood-sucking  islanders to their knees by striking at them through their bellies.    When I think of London and no food, and Glasgow and no food, then who  can say what will happen? Revolt! rebellion in England, and our brave  field greys on the west will smash them to atoms in the spring of 1917,  and I, Karl Schenk, will have helped directly in this! Great  thought--but calm! I am not there yet, there is still this confounded  medical board. I almost wish I had not drunk so much last night, not  that it makes any difference, but still one must run no risks, for I  hear that the medical is terribly strict for the U-boat service. Only  the cream is skimmed! Well, to-morrow we shall see.           *       *       *       *       *    Passed! and with flying colours; it seemed absurdly easy and only took  ten minutes, but then my physique is magnificent, thanks to the  physical training I have always done. I am now due to get three weeks'  leave, and then to Zeebrugge.    I have wired to the little mother at Frankfurt.           *       *       *       *       *    _At Zeebrugge, or rather Bruges._      I spent three weeks at home, all the family are pleased except mother;  she has a woman's dread of danger; it is a pleasing characteristic in  peace time, but a cloy on pleasure in days of war. To her, with the  narrowness of a female's intellect, I really believe I am of more  importance than the Fatherland--how absurd. Whilst at Frankfurt I saw a  good deal of Rosa; she seems better looking each time I meet her;  doubtless she is still developing to full womanhood. Moritz was home  from Flanders. He had ten days' leave from Ypres, and, though I have a  dislike for him, he certainly was interesting, though why the English  cling to those wretched ruins is more than I can understand.    I felt instinctively that in a sense Moritz and I were rivals where  Rosa was concerned, though I have never considered her in that  light--as yet. One day, perhaps? These women are much the same  everywhere, and I could see that having entered the U-boat service made  a difference with Rosa, though her logic should have told her that I  was no different. But is that right? After all, it is something to have  joined this service; the Guards themselves have no better cachet, and  it is certainly cheaper.    Here we live in billets and in a commandeered hotel. The life ashore is  pleasant enough; the damned Belgians are sometimes sulky, but they know  who is master. Bissing (a splendid chap) sees to that.    As a matter of fact we have benefited them by our occupation, the shops  do a roaring trade at preposterous prices, and shamefully enough the  German shopkeepers are most guilty. These pot-bellied merchants don't  seem to realize that they exist owing to our exertions.    I was much struck with the beautiful orderliness of the small gardens  which we have laid out since 1914, and, in fact, wherever one looks  there is evidence of the genius of the German race for thorough  organization. Yet these Belgians don't seem to appreciate it. I can't  understand it.    I find here that social life is very much gayer than at that mad town  of Wilhelmshaven. At the High Seas Fleet bases there was the strictness  and austerity that some people seem to consider necessary to show that  we are at war, though Heaven knows there was precious little war in the  High Seas Fleet; perhaps that was why the \"blood and iron\" regime was  in full order ashore. Here, in Bruges, at any rate as far as the  submarine officers are concerned, the matter is far different. When the  boats are in, one seems to do as one likes, with a perfunctory visit to  the ship in the course of the day.    Witnitz (the Commodore) favours complete relaxation when in from a  trip. In the evenings there are parties, for which there are always  ladies, and I find it is necessary to have a \"smoking.\"[1] I went to  the best tailor to buy one, and found that I must have one made at the  damnable price of 140 marks; the fitter, an oily Jew, had the  incredible impertinence to assure me it would be cut on London lines!    [Footnote 1: A dinner jacket.]    I nearly felled him to the ground; can one never get away from England  and things English? I'll see his account waits a bit before I settle  it.    There are several fellows I know here. Karl Mueller, who was 3rd  watchkeeper in the _Yorck_, and Adolf Hilfsbaumer, who was captain of  G.176, are the two I know best. They are both doing a few trips as  second in commands of the later U.C. boats, which are mine-laying off  the English coasts. This is a most dangerous operation, and nearly all  the U.C. boats are commanded by reserve officers, of whom there are a  good many in the Mess.    Excellent fellows, no doubt, but somewhat uncouth and lacking the finer  points of breeding; as far as I can see in the short time I have been  here they keep themselves to themselves a good deal. I certainly don't  wish to mix with them. Unfortunately, it appears that I am almost bound  to be appointed as second in command of one of the U.C. boats, for at  least one trip before I go to the periscope school and train for a  command of my own.
