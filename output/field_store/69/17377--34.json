That nod was one of infinite shrewdness which  commended itself to Miss Crane. These courtesies, far from making  awkward the material discussion which followed; did not affect it in the  least.    \"So you want me to board you?\" said she, as if in consternation.    Eliphalet calculated, if they could come to terms. And Mr. Barbo keyed  himself to enjoyment.    \"Single gentlemen,\" said she, \"pay as high as twelve dollars.\" And she  added that they had no cause to complain of her table.    Eliphalet said he guessed he'd have to go somewhere else. Upon this the  lady vouchsafed the explanation that those gentlemen had high positions  and rented her large rooms. Since Mr. Hopper was from Willesden and knew  the Salters, she would be willing to take him for less. Eliphalet said  bluntly he would give three and a half. Barbo gasped. This particular  kind of courage was wholly beyond him.    Half an hour later Eliphalet carried his carpet-bag up three flights and  put it down in a tiny bedroom under the eaves, still pulsing with  heat waves. Here he was to live, and eat at Miss Crane's table for the  consideration of four dollars a week.    Such is the story of the humble beginning of one substantial prop of the  American Nation. And what a hackneyed story it is! How many other young  men from the East have travelled across the mountains and floated down  the rivers to enter those strange cities of the West, the growth of  which was like Jonah's gourd.    Two centuries before, when Charles Stuart walked out of a window in  Whitehall Palace to die; when the great English race was in the throes  of a Civil War; when the Stern and the Gay slew each other at Naseby and  Marston Moor, two currents flowed across the Atlantic to the New World.  Then the Stern men found the stern climate, and the Gay found the  smiling climate.    After many years the streams began to move again, westward, ever  westward. Over the ever blue mountains from the wonderland of Virginia  into the greater wonderland of Kentucky. And through the marvels of the  Inland Seas, and by white conestogas threading flat forests and floating  over wide prairies, until the two tides met in a maelstrom as fierce as  any in the great tawny torrent of the strange Father of Waters. A city  founded by Pierre Laclede, a certain adventurous subject of Louis who  dealt in furs, and who knew not Marly or Versailles, was to be the place  of the mingling of the tides. After cycles of separation, Puritan and  Cavalier united on this clay-bank in the Louisiana Purchase, and swept  westward together--like the struggle of two great rivers when they meet  the waters for a while were dangerous.    So Eliphalet was established, among the Puritans, at Miss Crane's. The  dishes were to his taste. Brown bread and beans and pies were plentiful,  for it was a land of plenty. All kinds of Puritans were there, and they  attended Mr. Davitt's Congregational Church. And may it be added in  justice to Mr. Hopper, that he became not the least devout of the  boarders.          CHAPTER. II. THE MOLE    For some years, while Stephen A. Douglas and Franklin Pierce and other  gentlemen of prominence were playing at bowls on the United States of  America; while Kansas was furnishing excitement free of charge to any  citizen who loved sport, Mr. Eliphalet Hopper was at work like the  industrious mole, underground. It is safe to affirm that Colonel Carvel  forgot his new hand as soon as he had turned him over to Mr. Hood, the  manager. As for Mr. Hopper, he was content. We can ill afford to dissect  motives. Genius is willing to lay the foundations of her structure  unobserved.    At first it was Mr. Barbo alone who perceived Eliphalet's  greatness,--Mr. Barbo, whose opinions were so easily had that they  counted for nothing. The other clerks, to say the least, found the  newcomer uncompanionable. He had no time for skylarking, the heat of the  day meant nothing to him, and he was never sleepy. He learned the stock  as if by intuition, and such was his strict attention to business that  Mr. Hood was heard is say, privately, he did not like the looks of it.  A young man should have other interests. And then, although he would not  hold it against him, he had heard that Mr. Hopper was a teacher in Mr.  Davitt's Sunday School.    Because he did not discuss his ambitions at dinner with the other clerks  in the side entry, it must not be thought that Eliphalet was without  other interests. He was likewise too shrewd to be dragged into political  discussions at the boarding-house table. He listened imperturbably to  the outbursts against the Border Ruffian, and smiled when Mr. Abner  Reed, in an angry passion, asked him to declare whether or not he was  a friend of the Divine Institution. After a while they forgot about him  (all save Miss Crane), which was what Mr. Hopper of all things desired.    One other friend besides Miss Crane did Eliphalet take unto himself,  wherein he showed much discrimination. This friend was none other than  Mr. Davitt, minister for many years of the Congregational Church. For  Mr. Davitt was a good man, zealous in his work, unpretentious, and  kindly. More than once Eliphalet went to his home to tea, and was  pressed to talk about himself and his home life. The minister and his  wife ware invariably astonished, after their guest was gone, at the  meagre result of their inquiries.    If Love had ever entered such a discreet soul as that into which we are  prying, he used a back entrance. Even Mr. Barbo's inquiries failed in  the discovery of any young person with whom Eliphalet \"kept company.\"  Whatever the notions abroad concerning him, he was admittedly a model.  There are many kinds of models. With some young ladies at the Sunday  School, indeed, he had a distant bowing acquaintance. They spoke of him  as the young man who knew the Bible as thoroughly as Mr. Davitt himself.  The only time that Mr. Hopper was discovered showing embarrassment was  when Mr. Davitt held his hand before them longer than necessary on the  church steps. Mr. Hopper was not sentimental.    However fascinating the subject, I do not propose to make a whole book  about Eliphalet. Yet sidelights on the life of every great man are  interesting. And there are a few incidents in his early career which  have not gotten into the subscription biographical Encyclopaedias. In  several of these volumes, to be sure, we may see steel engravings of  him, true likenesses all. His was the type of face which is the glory of  the steel engraving,--square and solid, as a corner-stone should be. The  very clothes he wore were made for the steel engraving, stiff and wiry  in texture, with sharp angles at the shoulders, and sombre in hue, as  befit such grave creations.    Let us go back to a certain fine morning in the September of the year  1857, when Mr. Hopper had arrived, all unnoticed, at the age of two and  thirty. Industry had told. He was now the manager's assistant; and, be  it said in passing, knew more about the stock than Mr. Hood himself. On  this particular morning, about nine o'clock, he was stacking bolts of  woollen goods near that delectable counter where the Colonel was wont  to regale his principal customers, when a vision appeared in the door.  Visions were rare at Carvel & Company's. This one was followed by an  old negress with leathery wrinkles, whose smile was joy incarnate.  They entered the store, paused at the entrance to the Colonel's private  office, and surveyed it with dismay.    \"Clar t' goodness, Miss Jinny, yo' pa ain't heah! An' whah's Ephum, dat  black good-fo'-nuthin'!\"    Miracle number one,--Mr. Hopper stopped work and stared. The vision was  searching the store with her eyes, and pouting.    \"How mean of Pa!\" she exclaimed, \"when I took all this trouble to  surprise him, not to be here! Where are they all? Where's Ephum? Where's  Mr. Hood?\"    The eyes lighted on Eliphalet. His blood was sluggish, but it could be  made to beat faster. The ladies he had met at Miss Crane's were not of  this description. As he came forward, embarrassment made him shamble,  and for the first time in his life he was angrily conscious of a poor  figure. Her first question dashed out the spark of his zeal.    \"Oh,\" said she, \"are you employed here?\"    Thoughtless Virginia! You little know the man you have insulted by your  haughty drawl.    \"Yes.\"    \"Then find Mr. Carvel, won't you, please? And tell him that his daughter  has come from Kentucky, and is waiting for him.\"    \"I callate Mr. Carvel won't be here this morning,\" said Eliphalet. He  went back to the pile of dry goods, and began to work. But he was unable  to meet the displeasure in her face.    \"What is your name?\" Miss Carvel demanded.    \"Hopper.\"    \"Then, Mr. Hopper, please find Ephum, or Mr. Hood.\"    Two more bolts were taken off the truck. Out of the corner of his eye he  watched her, and she seemed very tall, like her father. She was taller  than he, in fact.    \"I ain't a servant, Miss Carvel,\" he said, with a meaning glance at the  negress.    \"Laws, Miss Jinny,\" cried she, \"I may's 'ell find Ephum. I knows he's  loafin' somewhar hereabouts. An' I ain't seed him dese five month.\" And  she started for the back of the store.    \"Mammy!\"    The old woman stopped short. Eliphalet, electrified, looked up and  instantly down again.    \"You say you are employed by Mr. Carvel, and refuse to do what I ask?\"    \"I ain't a servant,\" Mr. Hopper repeated doggedly. He felt that he was  in the right,--and perhaps he was.    It was at this critical juncture in the proceedings that a young man  stepped lightly into the store behind Miss Jinny. Mr. Hopper's eye was  on him, and had taken in the details of his costume before realizing  the import of his presence. He was perhaps twenty, and wore a coat that  sprung in at the waist, and trousers of a light buff-color that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54"],[0,"The Marvelous Land of Oz (#3)"],[1," lighted Mombi ordered him to build a fire in the  hearth, and while Tip was thus engaged the old woman ate her supper. When  the flames began to crackle the boy came to her and asked a share of the  bread and cheese; but Mombi refused him.    \"I'm hungry!\" said Tip, in a sulky tone.    \"You won't be hungry long,\" replied Mombi, with a grim look.    The boy didn't like this speech, for it sounded like a threat; but he  happened to remember he had nuts in his pocket, so he cracked some of those  and ate them while the woman rose, shook the crumbs from her apron, and hung  above the fire a small black kettle.    Then she measured out equal parts of milk and vinegar and poured them into  the kettle. Next she        25  produced several packets of herbs and powders and began adding a portion of  each to the contents of the kettle. Occasionally she would draw near the  candle and read from a yellow paper the recipe of the mess she was  concocting.    As Tip watched her his uneasiness increased.    \"What is that for?\" he asked.    \"For you,\" returned Mombi, briefly.    Tip wriggled around upon his stool and stared awhile at the kettle, which  was beginning to bubble. Then he would glance at the stern and wrinkled  features of the witch and wish he were any place but in that dim and smoky  kitchen, where even the shadows cast by the candle upon the wall were enough  to give one the horrors. So an hour passed away, during which the silence  was only broken by the bubbling of the pot and the hissing of the flames.    Finally, Tip spoke again.    \"Have I got to drink that stuff?\" he asked, nodding toward the pot.    \"Yes,\" said Mombi.    \"What'll it do to me?\" asked Tip.    \"If it's properly made,\" replied Mombi, \"it will change or transform you  into a marble statue.\"    Tip groaned, and wiped the perspiration from his forehead with his sleeve.        26    \"I don't want to be a marble statue!\" he protested.    \"That doesn't matter I want you to be one,\" said the old woman, looking at  him severely.    \"What use'll I be then?\" asked Tip. \"There won't be any one to work for  you.\"    \"I'll make the Pumpkinhead work for me,\" said Mombi.    Again Tip groaned.    \"Why don't you change me into a goat, or a chicken?\" he asked, anxiously.  \"You can't do anything with a marble statue.\"    \"Oh, yes, I can,\" returned Mombi. \"I'm going to plant a flower garden, next  Spring, and I'll put you in the middle of it, for an ornament. I wonder I  haven't thought of that before; you've been a bother to me for years.\"    At this terrible speech Tip felt the beads of perspiration starting all  over his body, but he sat still and shivered and looked anxiously at the  kettle.    \"Perhaps it won't work,\" he mutttered, in a voice that sounded weak and  discouraged.    \"Oh, I think it will,\" answered Mombi, cheerfully. \"I seldom make a  mistake.\"    Again there was a period of silence a silence so long and gloomy that when  Mombi finally lifted the kettle from the fire it was close to midnight.        27               Full page line-art drawing.                   \"I DON'T WANT TO BE A MARBLE STATUE.\"        28    \"You cannot drink it until it has become quite cold,\" announced the old  witch for in spite of the law she had acknowledged practising witchcraft.  \"We must both go to bed now, and at daybreak I will call you and at once  complete your transformation into a marble statue.\"    With this she hobbled into her room, bearing the steaming kettle with her,  and Tip heard her close and lock the door.    The boy did not go to bed, as he had been commanded to do, but still sat  glaring at the embers of the dying fire.                   Line-Art Drawing        29               The Flight of the Fugitives      Tip reflected.    \"It's a hard thing, to be a marble statue,\" he thought, rebelliously, \"and  I'm not going to stand it. For years I've been a bother to her, she says; so  she's going to get rid of me. Well, there's an easier way than to become a  statue. No boy could have any fun forever standing in the middle of a flower  garden! I'll run away, that's what I'll do--and I may as well go before  she makes me drink that nasty stuff in the kettle.\" He waited until the  snores of the old witch announced she was fast asleep, and then he arose  softly and went to the cupboard to find something to eat.        30    \"No use starting on a journey without food,\" he decided, searching upon the  narrow shelves.    He found some crusts of bread; but he had to look into Mombi's basket to  find the cheese she had brought from the village. While turning over the  contents of the basket he came upon the pepper-box which contained the  \"Powder of Life.\"    \"I may as well take this with me,\" he thought, \"or Mombi'll be using it to  make more mischief with.\" So he put the box in his pocket, together with the  bread and cheese.    Then he cautiously left the house and latched the door behind him. Outside  both moon and stars shone brightly, and the night seemed peaceful and  inviting after the close and ill-smelling kitchen.    \"I'll be glad to get away,\" said Tip, softly; \"for I never did like that old  woman. I wonder how I ever came to live with her.\"    He was walking slowly toward the road when a thought made him pause.    \"I don't like to leave Jack Pumpkinhead to the tender mercies of old Mombi,\"  he muttered. \"And Jack belongs to me, for I made him even if the old witch  did bring him to life.\"    He retraced his steps to the cow-stable and opened the door of the stall  where the pumpkin-        31               Full page line-art drawing.                   \"TIP LED HIM ALONG THE PATH.\"        32  headed man had been left.    Jack was standing in the middle of the stall, and by the moonlight Tip could  see he was smiling just as jovially as ever.    \"Come on!\" said the boy, beckoning.    \"Where to?\" asked Jack.    \"You'll know as soon as I do,\" answered Tip, smiling sympathetically into  the pumpkin face.    \"All we've got to do now is to tramp.\"    \"Very well,\" returned Jack, and walked awkwardly out of the stable and into  the moonlight.    Tip turned toward the road and the man followed him. Jack walked with a sort  of limp, and occasionally one of the joints of his legs would turn backward,  instead of frontwise, almost causing him to tumble. But the Pumpkinhead was  quick to notice this, and began to take more pains to step carefully; so  that he met with few accidents.    Tip led him along the path without stopping an instant. They could not go  very fast, but they walked steadily; and by the time the moon sank away and  the sun peeped over the hills they had travelled so great a distance that  the boy had no reason to fear pursuit from the old witch. Moreover, he had  turned first into one path, and then into another, so that should anyone  follow them it        33  would prove very difficult to guess which way they had gone, or where to  seek them.    Fairly satisfied that he had escaped--for a time, at least--being turned  into a marble statue, the boy stopped his companion and seated himself upon  a rock by the roadside.    \"Let's have some breakfast,\" he said.    Jack Pumpkinhead watched Tip curiously, but refused to join in the repast.  \"I don't seem to be made the same way you are,\" he said.    \"I know you are not,\" returned Tip; \"for I made you.\"    \"Oh! Did you?\" asked Jack.    \"Certainly. And put you together. And carved your eyes and nose and ears and                   Line-Art Drawing along the right side of the page        34    mouth,\" said Tip proudly. \"And dressed you.\"    Jack looked at his body and limbs critically.    \"It strikes me you made a very good job of it,\" he remarked.    \"Just so-so,\" replied Tip, modestly; for he began to see certain defects in  the construction of his man. \"If I'd known we were going to travel together  I might have been a little more particular.\"    \"Why, then,\" said the Pumpkinhead, in a tone that expressed surprise, \"you  must be my creator my parent my father!\"    \"Or your inventor,\" replied the boy with a laugh. \"Yes, my son; I really  believe I am!\"    \"Then I owe you obedience,\" continued the man, \"and you owe me--support.\"    \"That's it, exactly\", declared Tip, jumping up. \"So let us be off.\"    \"Where are we going?\" asked Jack, when they had resumed their journey.    \"I'm not exactly sure,\" said the boy; \"but I believe we are headed South,  and that will bring us, sooner or later, to the Emerald City.\"    \"What city is that?\" enquired the Pumpkinhead.    \"Why, it's the center of the Land of Oz, and the biggest town in all the  country. I've never been there, myself, but I've heard all about its        35  history. It was built by a mighty and wonderful Wizard named Oz, and  everything there is of a green color--just as everything in this Country  of the Gillikins is of a purple color.\"    \"Is everything here purple?\" asked Jack.    \"Of course it is. Can't you see?\" returned the boy.    \"I believe I must be color-blind,\" said the Pumpkinhead, after staring about  him.    \"Well, the grass is purple, and the trees are purple, and the houses and  fences are purple,\" explained Tip. \"Even the mud in the roads is purple. But  in the Emerald City everything is green that is purple here. And in the  Country of the Munchkins, over at the East, everything is blue; and in the  South country of the Quadlings everything is red; and in the West country of  the Winkies, where the Tin Woodman rules, everything is yellow.\"    \"Oh!\" said Jack. Then, after a pause, he asked: \"Did you say a Tin Woodman  rules the Winkies?\"    \"Yes; he was one of those who helped Dorothy to destroy the Wicked Witch of  the West, and the Winkies were so grateful that they invited him to become  their ruler,--just as the people of the Emerald City invited the Scarecrow  to rule them.\"    \"Dear me!\" said Jack. \"I'm getting confused with all this history. Who is  the Scarecrow?\"        36    \"Another friend of Dorothy's,\" replied"]]]
