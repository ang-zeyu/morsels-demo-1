It is  stated by a person who saw him mount that, although he leaped upon his  horse with most unseemly haste, he trotted away around the corner of the  block with circumspect deliberation.    Around both the house on Tenth street and the residence of Secretary  Seward, as the fact of both tragedies became generally known, crowds  soon gathered so vast and tumultuous that military guards scarcely  sufficed to keep them from the doors.    The room to which the President had been conveyed is on the first floor,  at the end of the hall. It is only fifteen feet square, with a Brussels  carpet, papered with brown, and hung with a lithograph of Rosa Bonheur's  \"Horse Fair,\" an engraved copy of Herring's \"Village Blacksmith,\" and  two smaller ones, of \"The Stable\" and \"The Barn Yard,\" from the same  artist. A table and bureau, spread with crotchet work, eight chairs and  the bed, were all the furniture. Upon this bed, a low walnut  four-poster, lay the dying President; the blood oozing from the  frightful wound in his head and staining the pillow. All that the  medical skill of half a dozen accomplished surgeons could do had been  done to prolong a life evidently ebbing from a mortal hurt.    Secretary Stanton, just arrived from the bedside of Mr. Seward, asked  Surgeon-General Barnes what was Mr. Lincoln's condition. \"I fear, Mr.  Stanton, that there is no hope.\" \"O, no, general; no, no;\" and the man,  of all others, apparently strange to tears, sank down beside the bed,  the hot, bitter evidences of an awful sorrow trickling through his  fingers to the floor. Senator Sumner sat on the opposite side of the  bed, holding one of the President's hands in his own, and sobbing with  kindred grief. Secretary Welles stood at the foot of the bed, his face  hidden, his frame shaken with emotion. General Halleck, Attorney-General  Speed, Postmaster-General Dennison, M. B. Field, Assistant Secretary of  the Treasury, Judge Otto, General Meigs, and others, visited the chamber  at times, and then retired. Mrs. Lincoln--but there is no need to speak  of her. Mrs. Senator Dixon soon arrived, and remained with her through  the night. All through the night, while the horror-stricken crowds  outside swept and gathered along the streets, while the military and  police were patrolling and weaving a cordon around the city; while men  were arming and asking each other, \"What victim next?\" while the  telegraph was sending the news from city to city over the continent, and  while the two assassins were speeding unharmed upon fleet horses far  away--his chosen friends watched about the death-bed of the highest of  the nation. Occasionally Dr. Gurley, pastor of the church where Mr.  Lincoln habitually attended, knelt down in prayer. Occasionally Mrs.  Lincoln and her sons, entered, to find no hope and to go back to  ceaseless weeping. Members of the cabinet, senators, representatives,  generals, and others, took turns at the bedside. Chief-Justice Chase  remained until a late hour, and returned in the morning. Secretary  McCulloch remained a constant watcher until 5 A. M. Not a gleam of  consciousness shone across the visage of the President up to his  death--a quiet, peaceful death at last--which came at twenty-two minutes  past seven A. M. Around the bedside at this time were Secretaries  Stanton, Welles, Usher, Attorney-General Speed, Postmaster-General  Dennison, M. B. Field, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Judge Otto,  Assistant Secretary of the Interior, General Halleck, General Meigs,  Senator Sumner, F. R. Andrews, of New-York, General Todd, of Dacotah,  John Hay, private secretary, Governor Oglesby, of Illinois, General  Farnsworth, Mrs. and Miss Kenny, Miss Harris, Captain Robert Lincoln,  son of the President, and Drs. E. W. Abbott, R. K. Stone, C. D. Gatch,  Neal Hall, and Leiberman. Rev. Dr. Gurley, after the event, knelt with  all around in prayer, and then, entering the adjoining room where were  gathered Mrs. Lincoln, Captain Robert Lincoln, Mr. John Hay, and others,  prayed again. Soon after 9 o'clock the remains were placed in a  temporary coffin and conveyed to the White House under a small escort.    In Secretary Seward's chamber, a similar although not so solemn a scene  prevailed; between that chamber and the one occupied by President  Lincoln, visitors alternated to and fro through the night. It had been  early ascertained that the wounds of the secretary were not likely to  prove mortal. A wire instrument, to relieve the pain which he suffered  from previous injuries, prevented the knife of the assassin from  striking too deep. Mr. Frederick Seward's injuries were more serious.  His forehead was broken in by the blow from, the pistol, and up to this  hour he has remained perfectly unconscious. The operation of trepanning  the skull has been performed, but little hope is had of his recovery.  Major Seward will get well. Mr. Hansell's condition is somewhat  doubtful.    Secretary Seward, who cannot speak, was not informed of the  assassination of the President, and the injury of his son, until  yesterday. He had been worrying as to why Mr. Lincoln did not visit him.  \"Why does'nt the President come to see me?\" he asked with his pencil.  \"Where is Frederick--what is the matter with him?\" Perceiving the  nervous excitement which these doubts occasioned, a consultation was  had, at which it was finally determined that it would be best to let the  secretary know the worst. Secretary Stanton was chosen to tell him.  Sitting down beside Mr. Seward's bed, yesterday afternoon, he therefore  related to him a full account of the whole affair. Mr. Seward was so  surprised and shocked that he raised one hand involuntarily, and  groaned. Such is the condition of affairs at this stage of the terror.  The pursuit of the assassins has commenced; the town is full of wild and  baseless rumors; much that is said is stirring, little is reliable. I  tell it to you as I get it, but fancy is more prolific than truth: be  patient! [Footnote: The facts above had been collected by Mr. Jerome B.  Stillion, before my arrival in Washington: the arrangement of them is my  own.]          LETTER II.    THE OBSEQUIES IN WASHINGTON.      Washington, April 19, (Evening).    The most significant and most creditable celebration ever held in  Washington has just transpired. A good ruler has been followed from his  home to the Capitol by a grand cortege, worthy of the memory and of the  nation's power. As description must do injustice to the extent of the  display, so must criticism fail to sufficiently commend its perfect  tastefulness, Rarely has a Republican assemblage been so orderly. The  funeral of Mr. Lincoln is something to be remembered for a _cycle_. It  caps all eulogy upon his life and services, and was, without exception,  the most representative, spontaneous, and remarkable testimonial ever  rendered to the remains of an American citizen.    The night before the funeral showed the probable character of the  cortege. At Willard's alone four hundred applications by telegraph for  beds were refused. As many as six thousand persons spent Tuesday night  in the streets, in depots and in outbuildings. The population of the  city this morning was not far short of a hundred thousand, and of these  as many at thirty thousand walked in procession with Mr. Lincoln's  ashes.    All orders of folks were at hand. The country adjacent sent in  hay-wagons, donkey-carts, dearborns. All who could slip away from the  army came to town, and every attainable section of the Union forwarded  mourners. At no time in his life had Mr. Lincoln so many to throng about  him as in this hour, when he is powerless to do any one a service. For  once in history, office-seekers were disinterested, and contractors and  hangers-on human. These came, for this time only, to the capital of the  republic without an axe to grind or a curiosity to subserve; respect and  grief were all their motive. This day was shown that the great public  heart beats unselfish and reverent, even after a dynasty of plunder and  war.    The arrangements for the funeral were made by Mr. Harrington,  Assistant-Secretary of the Treasury, who was beset by applicants for  tickets. The number of these were reduced to six hundred, the clergy  getting sixty and the press twenty. I was among the first to pass the  White House guards and enter the building.    Its freestone columns were draped in black, and all the windows were  funereal. The ancient reception-room was half closed, and the famous  East room, which is approached by a spacious hall, had been reserved for  the obsequies. There are none present here but a few silent attendants  of the late owner of the republican palace. Deeply ensconced in the  white satin stuffing of his coffin, the President lies like one asleep.  The broad, high, beautiful room is like the varnished interior of a  vault. The frescoed ceiling wears the national shield, some pointed  vases filled with flowers and fruit, and three emblazonings of gilt  pendant from which are shrouded chandeliers. A purplish gray is the  prevailing tint of the ceiling. The cornice is silver white, set off by  a velvet crimson. The wall paper is gold and red, broken by eight lofty  mirrors, which are chastely margined with black and faced with fleece.    Their imperfect surfaces reflect the lofty catafalque, an open canopy of  solemn alapaca, lined with tasteful satin of creamish lead, looped at  the curving roof and dropping to the four corners in half transparent  tapestry. Beneath the roof, the half light shines upon a stage of fresh  and fragrant flowers, up-bearing a long, high coffin. White lace of pure  silver pendant from the border throws a mild shimmer upon the solid  silver tracery hinges and emblazonings. A cross of lilies stands at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6630"],[0,"Curiosities of the Sky (#3)"],[1,"billows of immensity. From such conclusions the mind  instinctively shrinks. It prefers to think that there is something  beyond, though we cannot see it. Even the universe could not bear to  be alone -- a Crusoe lost in the Cosmos! As the inhabitants of the  most elegant chateau, with its gardens, parks, and crowds of  attendants, would die of loneliness if they did not know that they  have neighbors, though not seen, and that a living world of indefinite  extent surrounds them, so we, when we perceive that the universe has  limits, wish to feel that it is not solitary; that beyond the hedges  and the hills there are other centers of life and activity. Could  anything be more terrible than the thought of an isolated universe?  The greater the being, the greater the aversion to seclusion. Only the  infinite satisfies; in that alone the mind finds rest.    We are driven, then, to believe that the universal night which  envelopes us is not tenantless; that as we stare out of the  star-framed windows of the Galaxy and see nothing but uniform  blackness, the fault is with our eyes or is due to an obscuring  medium. Since our universe is limited in extent, there must be other  universes beyond it on all sides. Perhaps if we could carry our  telescopes to the verge of the great ``Coal-sack'' near the ``Cross,''  being then on the frontier of our starry system, we could discern,  sparkling afar off in the vast night, some of the outer galaxies. They  may be grander than ours, just as many of the suns surrounding us are  immensely greater than ours. If we could take our stand somewhere in  the midst of immensity and, with vision of infinite reach, look about  us, we should perhaps see a countless number of stellar systems, amid  which ours would be unnoticeable, like a single star among the  multitude glittering in the terrestial sky on a clear night. Some  might be in the form of a wreath, like our own; some might be  globular, like the great star-clusters in Hercules and Centaurus; some  might be glittering circles, or disks, or rings within rings. If we  could enter them we should probably find a vast variety of  composition, including elements unknown to terrestrial chemistry; for  while the visible universe appears to contain few if any substances  not existing on the earth or in the sun, we have no warrant to assume  that others may not exist in infinite space.    And how as to gravitation? We do not know that gravitation acts beyond  the visible universe, but it is reasonable to suppose that it does. At  any rate, if we let go its sustaining hand we are lost, and can only  wander hopelessly in our speculations, like children astray. If the  empire of gravitation is infinite, then the various outer systems must  have some, though measuring by our standards an imperceptible,  attractive influence upon each other, for gravitation never lets go  its hold, however great the space over which it is required to act.  Just as the stars about us are all in motion, so the starry systems  beyond our sight may be in motion, and our system as a whole may be  moving in concert with them. If this be so, then after interminable  ages the aspect of the entire system of systems must change, its  various members assuming new positions with respect to one another. In  the course of time we may even suppose that our universe will approach  relatively close to one of the others; and then, if men are yet living  on the earth, they may glimpse through the openings which reveal  nothing to us now, the lights of another nearing star system, like the  signals of a strange squadron, bringing them the assurance (which can  be but an inference at present) that the ocean of space has other  argosies venturing on its limitless expanse.    There remains the question of the luminiferous ether by whose agency  the waves of light are borne through space. The ether is as mysterious  as gravitation. With regard to ether we only infer its existence from  the effects which we ascribe to it. Evidently the ether must extend as  far as the most distant visible stars. But does it continue on  indefinitely in outer space? If it does, then the invisibility of the  other systems must be due to their distance diminishing the quantity  of light that comes from them below the limit of perceptibility, or to  the interposition of absorbing media; if it does not, then the reason  why we cannot see them is owing to the absence of a means of  conveyance for the light waves, as the lack of an interplanetary  atmosphere prevents us from hearing the thunder of sun-spots. (It is  interesting to recall that Mr Edison was once credited with the  intention to construct a gigantic microphone which should render the  roar of sun-spots audible by transforming the electric vibrations into  sound-waves). On this supposition each starry system would be  enveloped in its own globule of ether, and no light could cross from  one to another. But the probability is that both the ether and  gravitation are ubiquitous, and that all the stellar systems are  immersed in the former like clouds of phosphorescent organisms in the  sea.    So astronomy carries the mind from height to greater height. Men were  long in accepting the proofs of the relative insignificance of the  earth; they were more quickly convinced of the comparative littleness  of the solar system; and now the evidence assails their reason that  what they had regarded as the universe is only one mote gleaming in  the sunbeams of Infinity.    Star-Clouds, Star-Clusters, and Star-Streams    In the preceding chapter we have seen something of the strangely  complicated structure of the Galaxy, or Milky Way. We now proceed to  study more comprehensively that garlanded ``Pathway of the Gods.''    Judged by the eye alone, the Milky Way is one of the most delicately  beautiful phenomena in the entire realm of nature -- a shimmer of  silvery gauze stretched across the sky; but studied in the light of  its revelations, it is the most stupendous object presented to human  ken. Let us consider, first, its appearance to ordinary vision. Its  apparent position in the sky shifts according to the season. On a  serene, cloudless summer evening, in the absence of the moon, whose  light obscures it, one sees the Galaxy spanning the heavens from north  to southeast of the zenith like a phosphorescent arch. In early spring  it forms a similar but, upon the whole, less brilliant arch west of  the zenith. Between spring and summer it lies like a long, faint,  twilight band along the northern horizon. At the beginning of winter  it again forms an arch, this time spanning the sky from east to west,  a little north of the zenith. These are its positions as viewed from  the mean latitude of the United States. Even the beginner in  star-gazing does not have to watch it throughout the year in order to  be convinced that it is, in reality, a great circle, extending  entirely around the celestial sphere. We appear to be situated near  its center, but its periphery is evidently far away in the depths of  space.    Although to the casual observer it seems but a delicate scarf of  light, brighter in some places than in others, but hazy and indefinite  at the best, such is not its appearance to those who study it with  care. They perceive that it is an organic whole, though marvelously  complex in detail. The telescope shows that it consists of stars too  faint and small through excess of distance to be separately visible.  Of the hundred million suns which some estimates have fixed as the  probable population of the starry universe, the vast majority (at  least thirty to one) are included in this strange belt of misty light.  But they are not uniformly distributed in it; on the contrary, they  are arrayed in clusters, knots, bunches, clouds, and streams. The  appearance is somewhat as if the Galaxy consisted of innumerable  swarms of silver-winged bees, more or less intermixed, some massed  together, some crossing the paths of others, but all governed by a  single purpose which leads them to encircle the region of space in  which we are situated.    From the beginning of the systematic study of the heavens, the fact  has been recognized that the form of the Milky Way denotes the scheme  of the sidereal system. At first it was thought that the shape of the  system was that of a vast round disk, flat like a cheese, and filled  with stars, our sun and his relatively few neighbors being placed near  the center. According to this view, the galactic belt was an effect of  perspective; for when looking in the direction of the plane of the  disk, the eye ranged through an immense extension of stars which  blended into a glimmering blur, surrounding us like a ring; while when  looking out from the sides of the disk we saw but few stars, and in  those directions the heavens appeared relatively blank. Finally it was  recognized that this theory did not correspond with the observed  appearances, and it became evident that the Milky Way was not a mere  effect of perspective, but an actual band of enormously distant stars,  forming a circle about the sphere, the central opening of the ring  (containing many scattered stars) being many times broader than the  width of the ring itself. Our sun is one of the scattered stars in the  central opening.    As already remarked, the ring of the Galaxy is very irregular, and in  places it is partly broken. With its sinuous outline, its pendant  sprays, its graceful and accordant curves, its bunching of masses, its  occasional interstices, and the manifest order of a general plan  governing the jumble of its details, it bears a remarkable resemblance  to a garland -- a fact which appears the more wonderful when we recall  its composition. That an elm-tree should trace the lines of beauty  with its leafy and pendulous branches does not surprise us; but we can  only gaze with growing amazement when we behold a hundred million"]]]
