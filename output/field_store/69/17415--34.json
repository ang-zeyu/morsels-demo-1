Dicky took it all in at a glance, and wondered with a bitter wonder; for  this was an Englishman, and behind him and around him, though not  very near him, were Arabs, Soudanese, and Fellaheen, with sneering yet  apprehensive faces.    As Dicky's hand dropped away from his pistol, the other shot out  trembling, graceful, eager fingers, the one inexpressibly gentlemanly  thing about him.    \"Give it to me--quick!\" he said, and he threw a backward glance towards  the approaching group--Fielding, the egregious Pasha, and the rest.    Dicky did not hesitate; he passed the pistol over. The Lost One took the  pistol, cocked it, and held it to the head of the waler, which feebly  turned to him in recognition.    \"Good-bye, old man!\" he said, and fired.    The horse dropped, kicked, struggled once or twice, and was gone.    \"If you know the right spot, there's hardly a kick,\" said the Lost One,  and turned to face the Pasha, who had whipped his donkey forward on  them, and sat now livid with rage, before the two. He stood speechless  for a moment, for his anger had forced the fat of his neck up into his  throat.    But Dicky did not notice the Pasha. His eye was fixed on Fielding Bey,  and the eye of Fielding Bey was on the Lost One. All at once Dicky  understood why it was that Fielding Bey had shrunk from coming to Hasha.  Fielding might have offered many reasons, but this figure before them  was the true one. Trouble, pity, anxiety, pride, all were in Fielding's  face. Because the Lost One was an Englishman, and the race was shamed  and injured by this outcast? Not that alone. Fielding had the natural  pride of his race, but this look was personal. He glanced at the dead  horse, at the scarred sides, the raw shoulders, the corrugated haunches,  he saw the pistol in the Lost One's hand, and then, as a thread of  light steals between the black trees of a jungle, a light stole across  Fielding's face for a moment. He saw the Lost One hand the pistol back  to Dicky and fix his debauched blue eyes on the Pasha. These blue eyes  did not once look at Fielding, though they were aware of his presence.    \"Son of a dog!\" said the Pasha, and his fat forefinger convulsively  pointed to the horse.    The Lost One's eyes wavered a second, as though their owner had not  the courage to abide the effect of his action, then they quickened to a  point of steadiness, as a lash suddenly knots for a crack in the hand of  a postilion.    \"Swine!\" said the Lost One into the Pasha's face, and his round  shoulders drew up a little farther, so that he seemed more like a man  among men. His hands fell on his hips as, in his mess, an officer with  no pockets drops his knuckles on his waist-line for a stand-at-ease.    The egregious Selamlik Pasha stood high in favour with the Khedive: was  it not he who had suggested a tax on the earnings of the dancing girls,  the Ghazeeyehs, and did he not himself act as the first tax-gatherer?  Was it not Selamlik Pasha also who whispered into the ear of the  Mouffetish that a birth-tax and a burial-tax should be instituted?  And had he not seen them carried out in the mudiriehs under his own  supervision? Had he not himself made the Fellaheen pay thrice over for  water for their onion-fields? Had he not flogged an Arab to death with  his own hand, the day before Fielding's and Dicky's arrival, and had he  not tried to get this same Arab's daughter into his harem--this Selamlik  Pasha!    The voice of the Lost One suddenly rose shrill and excited, and he  shouted at the Pasha. \"Swine! swine! swine!... Kill your slaves with a  kourbash if you like, but a bullet's the thing for a waler!--Swine of a  leper!\"    The whole frame of the Lost One was still, but the voice was shaking,  querulous, half hysterical; the eyes were lighted with a terrible  excitement, the lips under the grey moustache twitched; the nervous  slipshod dignity of carriage was in curious contrast to the disordered  patchwork dress.    The trouble on Fielding's face glimmered with a little ray of hope  now. Dicky came over to him, and was about to speak, but a motion of  Fielding's hand stopped him. The hand said: \"Let them fight it out.\"    In a paroxysm of passion Selamlik Pasha called two Abyssinian slaves  standing behind. \"This brother of a toad to prison!\" he said.    The Lost One's eyes sought Dicky like a flash. Without a word, and as  quick as the tick of a clock, Dicky tossed over his pistol to the Lost  One, who caught it smoothly, turned it in his hand, and levelled it at  the Abyssinians.    \"No more of this damned nonsense, Pasha,\" said Fielding suddenly.  \"He doesn't put a high price on his life, and you do on yours. I'd be  careful!\"    \"Steady, Trousers!\" said Dicky in a soft voice, and smiled his girlish  smile.    Selamlik Pasha stared for a moment in black anger, then stuttered forth:  \"Will you speak for a dog of a slave that his own country vomits out?\"    \"Your mother was a slave of Darfur, Pasha,\" answered Fielding, in a low  voice; \"your father lost his life stealing slaves. Let's have no airs  and graces.\"    Dicky's eyes had been fixed on the Lost One, and his voice now said in  its quaint treble: \"Don't get into a perspiration. He's from where we  get our bad manners, and he messes with us to-night, Pasha.\"    The effect of these words was curious. Fielding's face was a blank  surprise, and his mouth opened to say no, but he caught Dicky's look and  the word was not uttered. The Pasha's face showed curious incredulity;  under the pallor of the Lost One's a purplish flush crept, stayed a  moment, then faded away, and left it paler than before.    \"We've no more business, I think, Pasha,\" said Fielding brusquely, and  turned his donkey towards the river. The Pasha salaamed without a word,  his Abyssinian slaves helped him on his great white donkey, and he  trotted away towards the palace, the trousers flapping about his huge  legs. The Lost One stood fingering the revolver. Presently he looked up  at Dicky, and, standing still, held out the pistol.    \"Better keep it,\" said Dicky; \"I'll give you some peas for it to-night.  Speak to the poor devil, Fielding,\" he added quickly, in a low tone.    Fielding turned in his saddle. \"Seven's the hour,\" he said, and rode on.    \"Thanks, you fellows,\" said the Lost One, and walked swiftly away.    As they rode to the Amenhotep Dicky did not speak, but once he turned  round to look after the outcast, who was shambling along the bank of the  canal.    When Fielding and Dicky reached the deck of the Amenhotep, and Mahommed  Seti had brought refreshment, Dicky said: \"What did he do?\"    Fielding's voice was constrained and hard: \"Cheated at cards.\"    Dicky's lips tightened. \"Where?\"    \"At Hong Kong.\"    \"Officer?\"    \"In the Buffs.\"    Dicky drew a long breath. \"He's paid the piper.\"    \"Naturally. He cheated twice.\"    \"Cheated twice--at cards!\" Dicky's voice was hard now. \"Who was he?\"    \"Heatherby--Bob Heatherby!\"    \"Bob Heatherby--gad! Fielding, I'm sorry--I couldn't have guessed, old  man. Mrs. Henshaw's brother!\"    Fielding nodded. Dicky turned his head away; for Fielding was in love  with Mrs. Henshaw, the widow of Henshaw of the Buffs. He realised now  why Fielding loathed Hasha so.    \"Forgive me for asking him to mess, guv'nor.\"    Fielding laughed a little uneasily. \"Never mind. You see, it isn't the  old scores only that bar him. He's been a sweep out here. Nothing  he hasn't done. Gone lower and lower and lower. Tax-gatherer with a  kourbash for old Selamlik the beast. Panderer for the same. Sweep of the  lowest sort!\"    Dicky's eyes flashed. \"I say, Fielding, it would be rather strange if he  hadn't gone down, down, down. A man that's cheated at cards never finds  anybody to help him up, up, up. The chances are dead against him. But he  stood up well to-day, eh?\"    \"I suppose blood will tell at last in the very worst.\"           \"'And while the lamp holds out to burn          The vilest sinner may return--'\"    hummed Dicky musingly. Then he added slowly: \"Fielding, fellows of that  kind always flare up a bit according to Cavendish, just before the end.  I've seen it once or twice before. It's the last clutch at the grass as  they go slip--slip--slipping down. Take my word for it, Heatherby's near  the finish.\"    \"I shouldn't wonder. Selamlik, the old leper, 'll lay in wait for him.  He'll get lost in the sugar-cane one of these evenings soon.\"    \"Couldn't we...\" Dicky paused.    Fielding started, looked at Dicky intently, and then shook his head  sadly. \"It's no good, Dicky. It never is.\"    \"'While the lamp holds out to burn...'\" said Dicky, and lighted another  cigarette.    Precisely at seven o'clock Heatherby appeared. He had on a dress-suit,  brown and rusty, a white tie made of a handkerchief torn in two, and a  pair of patent leather shoes, scraggy and cracked.    Fielding behaved well, Dicky was amiable and attentive, and the dinner  being ready to the instant, there was no waiting, there were no awkward  pauses. No names of English people were mentioned, England was not  named; nor Cairo, nor anything that English people abroad love to  discuss. The fellah, the pasha, the Soudan were the only topics. Under  Fielding's courtesy and Dicky's acute suggestions, Heatherby's weakened  brain awaked, and he talked intelligently, till the moment coffee was  brought in. Then, as Mahommed Seti retired, Heatherby suddenly threw  himself forward, his arms on the table, and burst into sobs.    \"Oh, you fellows, you fellows!\" he said. There was silence for a minute,  then he sobbed out again: \"It's the first time I've been treated like  a gentleman by men that knew me, these fifteen years. It--it gets me in  the throat!\"    His body shook with sobs. Fielding and Dicky were uncomfortable, for  these were not the sobs"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6267"],[0,"The Weavers: a tale of England and Egypt of fifty years ago - Complete (#3)"],[1," profane words in the Cloistered House. Feeling trouble ahead, and  liking the young man and his brother Elder, Luke Claridge, John Fairley  sought now to take the case into his own hands.    \"Thee shall never find a better name, David,\" he said, \"if thee live a  hundred years. It hath served well in England. This thee didst do.  While the young Earl of Eglington was being brought home, with noise  and brawling, after his return to Parliament, thee mingled among the  brawlers; and because some evil words were said of thy hat and thy  apparel, thee laid about thee, bringing one to the dust, so that his  life was in peril for some hours to come. Jasper Kimber was his name.\"    \"Were it not that the smitten man forgave thee, thee would now be in a  prison cell,\" shrilly piped the Elder who had asked his name.    \"The fight was fair,\" was the young man's reply. \"Though I am a Friend,  the man was English.\"    \"Thee was that day a son of Belial,\" rejoined the shrill Elder. \"Thee  did use thy hands like any heathen sailor--is it not the truth?\"    \"I struck the man. I punished him--why enlarge?\"    \"Thee is guilty?\"    \"I did the thing.\"    \"That is one charge against thee. There are others. Thee was seen  to drink of spirits in a public-house at Heddington that day.  Twice--thrice, like any drunken collier.\"    \"Twice,\" was the prompt correction.    There was a moment's pause, in which some women sighed and others folded  and unfolded their hands on their laps; the men frowned.    \"Thee has been a dark deceiver,\" said the shrill Elder again, and with  a ring of acrid triumph; \"thee has hid these things from our eyes many  years, but in one day thee has uncovered all. Thee--\"    \"Thee is charged,\" interposed Elder Fairley, \"with visiting a play this  same day, and with seeing a dance of Spain following upon it.\"    \"I did not disdain the music,\" said the young man drily; \"the flute,  of all instruments, has a mellow sound.\" Suddenly his eyes darkened, he  became abstracted, and gazed at the window where the twig flicked softly  against the pane, and the heat of summer palpitated in the air. \"It has  good grace to my ear,\" he added slowly.    Luke Claridge looked at him intently. He began to realize that there  were forces stirring in his grandson which had no beginning in Claridge  blood, and were not nurtured in the garden with the fruited wall. He was  not used to problems; he had only a code, which he had rigidly kept. He  had now a glimmer of something beyond code or creed.    He saw that the shrill Elder was going to speak. He intervened. \"Thee is  charged, David,\" he said coldly, \"with kissing a woman--a stranger and  a wanton--where the four roads meet 'twixt here and yonder town.\" He  motioned towards the hills.    \"In the open day,\" added the shrill Elder, a red spot burning on each  withered cheek.    \"The woman was comely,\" said the young man, with a tone of irony,  recovering an impassive look.    A strange silence fell, the women looked down; yet they seemed not so  confounded as the men. After a moment they watched the young man with  quicker flashes of the eye.    \"The answer is shameless,\" said the shrill Elder. \"Thy life is that of a  carnal hypocrite.\"    The young man said nothing. His face had become very pale, his lips were  set, and presently he sat down and folded his arms.    \"Thee is guilty of all?\" asked John Fairley.    His kindly eye was troubled, for he had spent numberless hours in this  young man's company, and together they had read books of travel and  history, and even the plays of Shakespeare and Marlowe, though drama was  anathema to the Society of Friends--they did not realize it in the life  around them. That which was drama was either the visitation of God or  the dark deeds of man, from which they must avert their eyes. Their own  tragedies they hid beneath their grey coats and bodices; their dirty  linen they never washed in public, save in the scandal such as this  where the Society must intervene. Then the linen was not only washed,  but duly starched, sprinkled, and ironed.    \"I have answered all. Judge by my words,\" said David gravely.    \"Has repentance come to thee? Is it thy will to suffer that which we  may decide for thy correction?\" It was Elder Fairley who spoke. He was  determined to control the meeting and to influence its judgment. He  loved the young man.    David made no reply; he seemed lost in thought. \"Let the discipline  proceed--he hath an evil spirit,\" said the shrill Elder.    \"His childhood lacked in much,\" said Elder Fairley patiently.    To most minds present the words carried home--to every woman who had a  child, to every man who had lost a wife and had a motherless son. This  much they knew of David's real history, that Mercy Claridge, his mother,  on a visit to the house of an uncle at Portsmouth, her mother's brother,  had eloped with and was duly married to the captain of a merchant ship.  They also knew that, after some months, Luke Claridge had brought her  home; and that before her child was born news came that the ship her  husband sailed had gone down with all on board. They knew likewise that  she had died soon after David came, and that her father, Luke Claridge,  buried her in her maiden name, and brought the boy up as his son,  not with his father's name but bearing that name so long honoured in  England, and even in the far places of the earth--for had not Benn  Claridge, Luke's brother, been a great carpet-merchant, traveller, and  explorer in Asia Minor, Egypt, and the Soudan--Benn Claridge of the  whimsical speech, the pious life? All this they knew; but none of them,  to his or her knowledge, had ever seen David's father. He was legendary;  though there was full proof that the girl had been duly married. That  had been laid before the Elders by Luke Claridge on an occasion when  Benn Claridge, his brother was come among them again from the East.    At this moment of trial David was thinking of his uncle, Benn Claridge,  and of his last words fifteen years before when going once again to the  East, accompanied by the Muslim chief Ebn Ezra, who had come with him  to England on the business of his country. These were Benn Claridge's  words: \"Love God before all, love thy fellow-man, and thy conscience  will bring thee safe home, lad.\"    \"If he will not repent, there is but one way,\" said the shrill Elder.    \"Let there be no haste,\" said Luke Claridge, in a voice that shook a  little in his struggle for self-control.    Another heretofore silent Elder, sitting beside John Fairley, exchanged  words in a whisper with him, and then addressed them. He was a very  small man with a very high stock and spreading collar, a thin face, and  large wide eyes. He kept his chin down in his collar, but spoke at the  ceiling like one blind, though his eyes were sharp enough on occasion.  His name was Meacham.    \"It is meet there shall be time for sorrow and repentance,\" he said.  \"This, I pray you all, be our will: that for three months David live  apart, even in the hut where lived the drunken chair-maker ere he  disappeared and died, as rumour saith--it hath no tenant. Let it be that  after to-morrow night at sunset none shall speak to him till that time  be come, the first day of winter. Till that day he shall speak to no  man, and shall be despised of the world, and--pray God--of himself. Upon  the first day of winter let it be that he come hither again and speak  with us.\"    On the long stillness of assent that followed there came a voice across  the room, from within a grey-and-white bonnet, which shadowed a delicate  face shining with the flame of the spirit within. It was the face of  Faith Claridge, the sister of the woman in the graveyard, whose soul  was \"with the Lord,\" though she was but one year older and looked much  younger than her nephew, David.    \"Speak, David,\" she said softly. \"Speak now. Doth not the spirit move  thee?\"    She gave him his cue, for he had of purpose held his peace till all had  been said; and he had come to say some things which had been churning  in his mind too long. He caught the faint cool sarcasm in her tone, and  smiled unconsciously at her last words. She, at least, must have reasons  for her faith in him, must have grounds for his defence in painful days  to come; for painful they must be, whether he stayed to do their  will, or went into the fighting world where Quakers were few and life  composite of things they never knew in Hamley.    He got to his feet and clasped his hands behind his back. After an  instant he broke silence.    \"All those things of which I am accused, I did; and for them is asked  repentance. Before that day on which I did these things was there  complaint, or cause for it? Was my life evil? Did I think in secret that  which might not be done openly? Well, some things I did secretly. Ye  shall hear of them. I read where I might, and after my taste, many  plays, and found in them beauty and the soul of deep things. Tales  I have read, but a few, and John Milton, and Chaucer, and Bacon, and  Montaigne, and Arab poets also, whose books my uncle sent me. Was this  sin in me?\"    \"It drove to a day of shame for thee,\" said the shrill Elder.    He took no heed, but continued: \"When I was a child I listened to the  lark as it rose from the meadow; and I hid myself in the hedge that,  unseen, I might hear it sing; and at night I waited till I could hear  the nightingale. I have heard the river singing, and the music of the  trees. At first I thought that this must be sin, since ye condemn the  human voice that sings, but I could feel no guilt. I heard men and women  sing upon the village green, and I sang also. I heard bands of music.  One instrument seemed to me more than all the rest. I bought one  like it, and learned to play. It was the flute--its note so soft and  pleasant. I learned to play it--years ago--in the woods of Beedon beyond  the hill, and I have felt no guilt from"]]]
