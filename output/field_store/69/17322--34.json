[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/470"],[0,"Heretics (#3)"],[1," All the people make a rush for the lamp-post,  the lamp-post is down in ten minutes, and they go about congratulating  each other on their unmediaeval practicality. But as things go on they  do not work out so easily.  Some people have pulled the lamp-post down  because they wanted the electric light; some because they wanted old  iron; some because they wanted darkness, because their deeds were evil.  Some thought it not enough of a lamp-post, some too much; some acted  because they wanted to smash municipal machinery; some because they  wanted to smash something. And there is war in the night, no man  knowing whom he strikes. So, gradually and inevitably, to-day,  to-morrow, or the next day, there comes back the conviction that the  monk was right after all, and that all depends on what is the  philosophy of Light. Only what we might have discussed under the  gas-lamp, we now must discuss in the dark.        II.  On the negative spirit    Much has been said, and said truly, of the monkish morbidity, of the  hysteria which as often gone with the visions of hermits or nuns. But  let us never forget that this visionary religion is, in one sense,  necessarily more wholesome than our modern and reasonable morality. It  is more wholesome for this reason, that it can contemplate the idea of  success or triumph in the hopeless fight towards the ethical ideal, in  what Stevenson called, with his usual startling felicity, \"the lost  fight of virtue.\"  A modern morality, on the other hand, can only point  with absolute conviction to the horrors that follow breaches of law;  its only certainty is a certainty of ill. It can only point to  imperfection.  It has no perfection to point to. But the monk  meditating upon Christ or Buddha has in his mind an image of perfect  health, a thing of clear colours and clean air. He may contemplate this  ideal wholeness and happiness far more than he ought; he may  contemplate it to the neglect of exclusion of essential THINGS; he may  contemplate it until he has become a dreamer or a driveller; but still  it is wholeness and happiness that he is contemplating. He may even go  mad; but he is going mad for the love of sanity. But the modern student  of ethics, even if he remains sane, remains sane from an insane dread  of insanity.    The anchorite rolling on the stones in a frenzy of submission is a  healthier person fundamentally than many a sober man in a silk hat who  is walking down Cheapside.  For many such are good only through a  withering knowledge of evil. I am not at this moment claiming for the  devotee anything more than this primary advantage, that though he may  be making himself personally weak and miserable, he is still fixing his  thoughts largely on gigantic strength and happiness, on a strength that  has no limits, and a happiness that has no end. Doubtless there are  other objections which can be urged without unreason against the  influence of gods and visions in morality, whether in the cell or  street.  But this advantage the mystic morality must always have--it is  always jollier.  A young man may keep himself from vice by continually  thinking of disease. He may keep himself from it also by continually  thinking of the Virgin Mary.  There may be question about which method  is the more reasonable, or even about which is the more efficient. But  surely there can be no question about which is the more wholesome.    I remember a pamphlet by that able and sincere secularist, Mr. G. W.  Foote, which contained a phrase sharply symbolizing and dividing these  two methods.  The pamphlet was called BEER AND BIBLE, those two very  noble things, all the nobler for a conjunction which Mr. Foote, in his  stern old Puritan way, seemed to think sardonic, but which I confess to  thinking appropriate and charming. I have not the work by me, but I  remember that Mr. Foote dismissed very contemptuously any attempts to  deal with the problem of strong drink by religious offices or  intercessions, and said that a picture of a drunkard's liver would be  more efficacious in the matter of temperance than any prayer or praise.  In that picturesque expression, it seems to me, is perfectly embodied  the incurable morbidity of modern ethics. In that temple the lights are  low, the crowds kneel, the solemn anthems are uplifted.  But that upon  the altar to which all men kneel is no longer the perfect flesh, the  body and substance of the perfect man; it is still flesh, but it is  diseased. It is the drunkard's liver of the New Testament that is  marred for us, which we take in remembrance of him.    Now, it is this great gap in modern ethics, the absence of vivid  pictures of purity and spiritual triumph, which lies at the back of the  real objection felt by so many sane men to the realistic literature of  the nineteenth century.  If any ordinary man ever said that he was  horrified by the subjects discussed in Ibsen or Maupassant, or by the  plain language in which they are spoken of, that ordinary man was  lying.  The average conversation of average men throughout the whole of  modern civilization in every class or trade is such as Zola would never  dream of printing. Nor is the habit of writing thus of these things a  new habit. On the contrary, it is the Victorian prudery and silence  which is new still, though it is already dying.  The tradition of  calling a spade a spade starts very early in our literature and comes  down very late.  But the truth is that the ordinary honest man,  whatever vague account he may have given of his feelings, was not  either disgusted or even annoyed at the candour of the moderns. What  disgusted him, and very justly, was not the presence of a clear  realism, but the absence of a clear idealism. Strong and genuine  religious sentiment has never had any objection to realism; on the  contrary, religion was the realistic thing, the brutal thing, the thing  that called names.  This is the great difference between some recent  developments of Nonconformity and the great Puritanism of the  seventeenth century.  It was the whole point of the Puritans that they  cared nothing for decency. Modern Nonconformist newspapers distinguish  themselves by suppressing precisely those nouns and adjectives which  the founders of Nonconformity distinguished themselves by flinging at  kings and queens. But if it was a chief claim of religion that it spoke  plainly about evil, it was the chief claim of all that it spoke plainly  about good. The thing which is resented, and, as I think, rightly  resented, in that great modern literature of which Ibsen is typical, is  that while the eye that can perceive what are the wrong things  increases in an uncanny and devouring clarity, the eye which sees what  things are right is growing mistier and mistier every moment, till it  goes almost blind with doubt.  If we compare, let us say, the morality  of the DIVINE COMEDY with the morality of Ibsen's GHOSTS, we shall see  all that modern ethics have really done. No one, I imagine, will accuse  the author of the INFERNO of an Early Victorian prudishness or a  Podsnapian optimism. But Dante describes three moral  instruments--Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell, the vision of perfection, the  vision of improvement, and the vision of failure.  Ibsen has only  one--Hell. It is often said, and with perfect truth, that no one could  read a play like GHOSTS and remain indifferent to the necessity of an  ethical self-command. That is quite true, and the same is to be said of  the most monstrous and material descriptions of the eternal fire. It is  quite certain the realists like Zola do in one sense promote  morality--they promote it in the sense in which the hangman promotes  it, in the sense in which the devil promotes it. But they only affect  that small minority which will accept any virtue of courage.  Most  healthy people dismiss these moral dangers as they dismiss the  possibility of bombs or microbes. Modern realists are indeed  Terrorists, like the dynamiters; and they fail just as much in their  effort to create a thrill. Both realists and dynamiters are  well-meaning people engaged in the task, so obviously ultimately  hopeless, of using science to promote morality.    I do not wish the reader to confuse me for a moment with those vague  persons who imagine that Ibsen is what they call a pessimist. There are  plenty of wholesome people in Ibsen, plenty of good people, plenty of  happy people, plenty of examples of men acting wisely and things ending  well.  That is not my meaning. My meaning is that Ibsen has throughout,  and does not disguise, a certain vagueness and a changing attitude as  well as a doubting attitude towards what is really wisdom and virtue in  this life--a vagueness which contrasts very remarkably with the  decisiveness with which he pounces on something which he perceives to  be a root of evil, some convention, some deception, some ignorance. We  know that the hero of GHOSTS is mad, and we know why he is mad. We do  also know that Dr. Stockman is sane; but we do not know why he is sane.  Ibsen does not profess to know how virtue and happiness are brought  about, in the sense that he professes to know how our modern sexual  tragedies are brought about. Falsehood works ruin in THE PILLARS OF  SOCIETY, but truth works equal ruin in THE WILD DUCK.  There are no  cardinal virtues of Ibsenism. There is no ideal man of Ibsen.  All this  is not only admitted, but vaunted in the most valuable and thoughtful  of all the eulogies upon Ibsen, Mr. Bernard Shaw's QUINTESSENCE OF  IBSENISM. Mr. Shaw sums up Ibsen's teaching in the phrase, \"The golden  rule is that there is no golden rule.\"  In his eyes this absence of an  enduring and positive ideal, this absence of a permanent key to virtue,  is the one great Ibsen merit. I am not discussing now with any fullness  whether this is so or not. All I venture to point out, with an  increased firmness, is that this omission, good or bad,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47109"],[0,"Gospel Doctrine: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Joseph F.

Our hope of salvation must be founded upon  the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, for we cannot  build upon error and ascend into the courts of eternal truth and enjoy  the glory and exaltation of the kingdom of our God. That cannot be  done.--_Oct. C. R.,_[A] 1917, p. 3.    [Footnote A: _October Conference Report_.]    THE GOSPEL FOUNDED IN TRUTH. I have no fears in my heart, or mind, that  that which is called \"Mormonism\"--which is indeed the gospel of Jesus  Christ--will not bear the scrutiny of science and the researches of the  learned and literate into all truth. The gospel of Jesus is founded in  truth. Every principle of it is susceptible of demonstration beyond any  just reason for contradiction. The Lord is doing his work and will do  it, and no power can stay it.--_Oct. C. R.,_ 1908, p. 127.    TRUTH THE FOUNDATION. We believe in righteousness. We believe in all  truth, no matter to what subject it may refer. No sect or religious  denomination in the world possesses a single principle of truth that  we do not accept or that we will reject. We are willing to receive  all truth, from whatever source it may come; for truth will stand,  truth will endure. No man's faith, no man's religion, no religious  organization in all the world, can ever rise above the truth. The truth  must be at the foundation of religion, or it is in vain and it will  fail of its purpose. I say that the truth is at the foundation, at the  bottom and top of, and it {2} entirely permeates this great work of the  Lord that was established through the instrumentality of Joseph Smith,  the prophet. God is with it; it is his work, not that of man; and it  will succeed, no matter what the opposition may be. We look now at the  opposition arrayed against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints, and smile, so to speak, with feelings of confidence, doubly  assured by the experience of the past, in comparison to the feelings  that possessed the souls of our fathers and mothers in the early days  of the Church, when they were but a handful, with all the world arrayed  against them; just a few poor, homeless people, driven from their  possessions, cast out from the communities in which they sought to  establish themselves and build their homes. When I think of our people,  thrust into the wilderness wandering and seeking for a place where  the soles of their feet might rest, and see, then, the world arrayed  against them, and think of the little chance that appeared before them,  for success and the accomplishment of their purposes, I wonder that  more of them did not tremble and falter than did; but some of them were  true in the midst of it all, even unto death. If it had been necessary  for them to have been martyred for the truth, willingly would they have  given their lives, as they gave all else that they possessed in the  world, for the knowledge they had of the divinity of the work in which  they were engaged. Are we as faithful today? Are we as devout as our  fathers were? Oh, my God, help me to be as true as they were! Help me  to stand as they stood, upon the pedestal of eternal truth, that no  power on earth, or in hell, may remove me from that foundation. This  is my prayer to the Lord for my own sake, and it is my prayer to him  for every Latter-day Saint throughout the length and breadth of the  world.--_Apr. C. R.,_[A] 1909, p. 7.    [Footnote A: _April Conference Report_.]    MAN SAVED BY TRUTH. We have no ill feelings in our {3} hearts toward  any living creature. We forgive those who trespass against us. Those  who have spoken evil of us, and who have misrepresented us before the  world, we have no malice in our hearts toward them. We say, let God  judge between them and us; let him recompense them for their work. We  will not raise a hand against them; but we will extend the hand of  fellowship and friendship to them, if they will repent of their sins  and come unto the Lord and live. No matter how malicious they may have  been, or how foolish they may have acted, if they will repent of it we  will receive them with open arms and we will do all we can to help them  to save themselves. I cannot save you; you cannot save me; we cannot  save each other, only so far as we can persuade each other to receive  the truth, by teaching it. When a man receives the truth he will be  saved by it. He will not be saved merely because some one talks to him,  but because he received and acted upon it. The gospel is consistent,  it is common sense, reason, revelation; it is almighty truth from the  heavens made known to man.--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1902, p. 86.    GOSPEL TRUTH CAN NOT BE SUPERSEDED. There is no science, nor  philosophy, that can supersede God Almighty's truth. The Lord has said,  \"My word is truth,\" and indeed it is; and I believe that the Latter-day  Saints know enough about the word of God to know it is his word when  they see it and shun whatever is not; and that they win abide by the  word of God, for it is truth. As the Savior said, \"If ye continue in my  word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and  the truth shall make you free.\" I believe that the Latter-day Saints,  and especially the leading men in Israel, have sufficient knowledge  and understanding of the principles of the gospel that they know the  truth, and they are made free by its possession--free from sin, free  from error, free from darkness, from the traditions of men, from vain  philosophy, and from {4} the untried, unproven theories of scientists,  that need demonstration beyond the possibility of a doubt. We have had  science and philosophy through all the ages, and they have undergone  change after change. Scarcely a century has passed but they have  introduced new theories of science and of philosophy that supersede  the old traditions and the old faith and the old doctrines entertained  by philosophers and scientists. These things may undergo continuous  changes, but the word of God is always true, is always right. I want  to say to you that the principles of the gospel are always true--the  principles of faith in God, of repentance from sin, of baptism for  the remission of sins by authority of God, and the laying on of hands  for the gift of the Holy Ghost;"]]]
