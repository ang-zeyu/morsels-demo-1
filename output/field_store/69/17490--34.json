The rose and the lily were fighting together in her face,  and one could not tell which of them got the victory. Her arms and  hands were like the lime, her mouth as red as a strawberry when it is  ripe, her foot was as small and as light as another one's hand, her  form was smooth and slender, and her hair was falling down from her  head in buckles of gold. Her garments and dress were woven with gold  and silver, and the bright stone that was in the ring on her hand was  as shining as the sun.    Guleesh was nearly blinded with all the loveliness and beauty that was  in her; but when he looked again, he saw that she was crying, and that  there was the trace of tears in her eyes. \"It can't be,\" said Guleesh,  \"that there's grief on her, when everybody round her is so full of  sport and merriment.\"    \"Musha, then, she is grieved,\" said the little man; \"for it's against  her own will she's marrying, and she has no love for the husband she is  to marry. The king was going to give her to him three years ago, when  she was only fifteen, but she said she was too young, and requested him  to leave her as she was yet. The king gave her a year's grace, and when  that year was up he gave her another year's grace, and then another;  but a week or a day he would not give her longer, and she is eighteen  years old to-night, and it's time for her to marry; but, indeed,\" says  he, and he crooked his mouth in an ugly way--\"indeed, it's no king's  son she'll marry, if I can help it.\"    Guleesh pitied the handsome young lady greatly when he heard that, and  he was heart-broken to think that it would be necessary for her to  marry a man she did not like, or, what was worse, to take a nasty  sheehogue for a husband. However, he did not say a word, though he  could not help giving many a curse to the ill-luck that was laid out  for himself, to be helping the people that were to snatch her away from  her home and from her father.    He began thinking, then, what it was he ought to do to save her, but he  could think of nothing. \"Oh! if I could only give her some help and  relief,\" said he, \"I wouldn't care whether I were alive or dead; but I  see nothing that I can do for her.\"    He was looking on when the king's son came up to her and asked her for  a kiss, but she turned her head away from him. Guleesh had double pity  for her then, when he saw the lad taking her by the soft white hand,  and drawing her out to dance. They went round in the dance near where  Guleesh was, and he could plainly see that there were tears in her eyes.    When the dancing was over, the old king, her father, and her mother the  queen, came up and said that this was the right time to marry her, that  the bishop was ready, and it was time to put the wedding-ring on her  and give her to her husband.    The king took the youth by the hand, and the queen took her daughter,  and they went up together to the altar, with the lords and great people  following them.    When they came near the altar, and were no more than about four yards  from it, the little sheehogue stretched out his foot before the girl,  and she fell. Before she was able to rise again he threw something that  was in his hand upon her, said a couple of words, and upon the moment  the maiden was gone from amongst them. Nobody could see her, for that  word made her invisible. The little man_een_ seized her and raised her  up behind Guleesh, and the king nor no one else saw them, but out with  them through the hall till they came to the door.    Oro! dear Mary! it's there the pity was, and the trouble, and the  crying, and the wonder, and the searching, and the _rookawn_, when that  lady disappeared from their eyes, and without their seeing what did it.  Out of the door of the palace they went, without being stopped or  hindered, for nobody saw them, and, \"My horse, my bridle, and saddle!\"  says every man of them. \"My horse, my bridle, and saddle!\" says  Guleesh; and on the moment the horse was standing ready caparisoned  before him. \"Now, jump up, Guleesh,\" said the little man, \"and put the  lady behind you, and we will be going; the morning is not far off from  us now.\"    Guleesh raised her up on the horse's back, and leaped up himself before  her, and, \"Rise, horse,\" said he; and his horse, and the other horses  with him, went in a full race until they came to the sea.    \"Hie over cap!\" said every man of them.    \"Hie over cap!\" said Guleesh; and on the moment the horse rose under  him, and cut a leap in the clouds, and came down in Erin.    They did not stop there, but went of a race to the place where was  Guleesh's house and the rath. And when they came as far as that,  Guleesh turned and caught the young girl in his two arms, and leaped  off the horse.    \"I call and cross you to myself, in the name of God!\" said he; and on  the spot, before the word was out of his mouth, the horse fell down,  and what was in it but the beam of a plough, of which they had made a  horse; and every other horse they had, it was that way they made it.  Some of them were riding on an old besom, and some on a broken stick,  and more on a bohalawn or a hemlock-stalk.    The good people called out together when they heard what Guleesh said:    \"Oh! Guleesh, you clown, you thief, that no good may happen you, why  did you play that trick on us?\"    But they had no power at all to carry off the girl, after Guleesh had  consecrated her to himself.    \"Oh! Guleesh, isn't that a nice turn you did us, and we so kind to you?  What good have we now out of our journey to France. Never mind yet, you  clown, but you'll pay us another time for this. Believe us, you'll  repent it.\"    \"He'll have no good to get out of the young girl,\" said the little man  that was talking to him in the palace before that, and as he said the  word he moved over to her and struck her a slap on the side of the  head. \"Now,\" says he, \"she'll be without talk any more; now, Guleesh,  what good will she be to you when she'll be dumb? It's time for us to  go--but you'll remember us, Guleesh!\"    When he said that he stretched out his two hands, and before Guleesh  was able to give an answer, he and the rest of them were gone into the  rath out of his sight, and he saw them no more.    He turned to the young woman and said to her: \"Thanks be to God,  they're gone. Would you not sooner stay with me than with them?\" She  gave him no answer. \"There's trouble and grief on her yet,\" said  Guleesh in his own mind, and he spoke to her again: \"I am afraid that  you must spend this night in my father's house, lady, and if there is  anything that I can do for you, tell me, and I'll be your servant.\"    The beautiful girl remained silent, but there were tears in her eyes,  and her face was white and red after each other.    \"Lady,\" said Guleesh, \"tell me what you would like me to do now. I  never belonged at all to that lot of sheehogues who carried you away  with them. I am the son of an honest farmer, and I went with them  without knowing it. If I'll be able to send you back to your father  I'll do it, and I pray you make any use of me now that you may wish.\"    He looked into her face, and he saw the mouth moving as if she was  going to speak, but there came no word from it.    \"It cannot be,\" said Guleesh, \"that you are dumb. Did I not hear you  speaking to the king's son in the palace to-night? Or has that devil  made you really dumb, when he struck his nasty hand on your jaw?\"    The girl raised her white smooth hand, and laid her finger on her  tongue, to show him that she had lost her voice and power of speech,  and the tears ran out of her two eyes like streams, and Guleesh's own  eyes were not dry, for as rough as he was on the outside he had a soft  heart, and could not stand the sight of the young girl, and she in that  unhappy plight.    He began thinking with himself what he ought to do, and he did not like  to bring her home with himself to his father's house, for he knew well  that they would not believe him, that he had been in France and brought  back with him the king of France's daughter, and he was afraid they  might make a mock of the young lady or insult her.    As he was doubting what he ought to do, and hesitating, he chanced to  remember the priest. \"Glory be to God,\" said he, \"I know now what I'll  do; I'll bring her to the priest's house, and he won't refuse me to  keep the lady and care for her.\" He turned to the lady again and told  her that he was loth to take her to his father's house, but that there  was an excellent priest very friendly to himself, who would take good  care of her, if she wished to remain in his house; but that if there  was any other place she would rather go, he said he would bring her to  it.    She bent her head, to show him she was obliged, and gave him to  understand that she was ready to follow him any place he was going. \"We  will go to the priest's house, then,\" said he; \"he is under an  obligation to me, and will do anything I ask him.\"    They went together accordingly to the priest's house, and the sun was  just rising when they came to the door. Guleesh beat it hard, and as  early as it was the priest was up, and opened the door himself. He  wondered when he saw Guleesh and the girl, for he was certain that it  was coming wanting to be married they were.    \"Guleesh, Guleesh, isn't it the nice boy you are that you can't wait  till ten o'clock or till twelve, but that you must be coming to me at  this hour, looking for marriage, you and your sweetheart? You ought to  know that I can't marry you at such a time, or, at all events, can't  marry you lawfully. But ubbubboo!\" said he, suddenly, as he looked  again at the young girl, \"in the name of God, who have you here? Who is  she, or how did you get her?\"    \"Father,\" said Guleesh, \"you can marry me, or anybody else, if you  wish; but it's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7889"],[0,"Erotica Romana (#3)"],[1,"eyes, holding hands, giving kisses, exchanging        Syllables sweet and those words lovers alone understand,      Murmuring our conversations we stutter in sweet oratory.        Hymns of such sort pass away, wanting prosodical tact.      Goddess of morning, Aurora, as friend of my muse I once knew you.        Has the unprincipled god, Cupid, seduced you now too?      So that these mornings you come as his sweetheart, awakening me at        His festive altar again, where I must celebrate him?      Here on my breast flows her hair, an abundance of curls, while her head rests,        Pressing my arm as it's bent, so as to pillow her neck.      What a delicious condition, if only these few tranquil moments        Could in my memory fix firmly that image of joy      When the night rocked us to sleep--but in slumber she's moving away now,        From my side turns, as she goes leaving her hand in my hand.      Love in our hearts makes us one, as the genuine need there stays constant;        Only returning desire knows oscillation or change.      Gently her hand presses mine, now she opens her eyes and is looking        Into my own eyes. No--don't. Let my thoughts rest on your form!      Please close your eyes. They're inebriation, confusion, they rob me        All too soon of the joy quiet reflection affords.      Grand are the forms of this body and nobly positioned each member.        Had Ariadne lain thus, Theseus never had fled.      Only a single kiss for these lips and then, O Theseus, leave her;        Look at her eyes--she's awake! Now you're eternally bound.          XVI      Boy, won't you light me a lamp. \"But dear master, there's light in the sky yet.        Don't waste your oil and the wick. Don't close the shutters so soon.      Only the houses are blocking the sun there, it's not yet the mountains.        Until the curfew shall ring, full half an hour must pass.\"      Wretched young fellow, be gone and obey me! My loved one is coming.        Lamplight, console me till then, harbinger warm of the night.          XVII      Poets of old in chorus cried out against those two serpents,        Making them horrible names, hated in all of the world:      Python the one, the other the Hydra of Lerna. These monsters        Both have now been destroyed, thanks to the deeds of the gods.      Fire-breathing, venomous once, they no longer now depredate our        Flocks and meadows and woods, fields of golden grain.      How is it then that some spiteful god in his wrath has        Raised from the poisonous slime offspring so monstrous again?      There's an insidious viper creeps into the loveliest gardens,        Lying in wait to attack all who seek pleasure therein.      Noble Hesperian dragon, I call you courageous and forthright.        Boldly defending your own beautiful apples of gold.      As for this worm, why he is not guarding at all, for his presence        Sullies both garden and fruit, till they deserve no defense.      Secretly coiled beneath bushes, where he befouls the sweet wellsprings,        Turning to poisonous drool Cupid's lifegiving dew.      Happy Lucretius knew how in his day to forego love completely,        Fearing not to enjoy pleasure in anyone's arms.      Fortunate Ancient, Propertius, for you a slave fetched the girls down        From the Aventine Hill, from Tarpeia's grove.      Cynthia then, when driving you out of such unchaste embraces,        Found you unfaithful, it's true, but she did find you whole.      Who would today dare attempt to escape from fidelity's ennui?        Love does not hold one back--only concern for one's health.      Even the woman we love may afford us uncertain enjoyment;        Nowhere can feminine lap safely encouch a man's head.      Matrimonial bed's insecure and so's fornication;        Husband, lover and wife pass to each other the hurt.      Think of those ages of gold when Jupiter followed his urges,        Chose Callisto one day, turned to Semel the next.      It was important to him to find thresholds of temples so sacred        Pure when, enamoured, he sought powerful entry to them.      Can you imagine the ragings of Juno if in love's skirmish        Poisonous weapons on her by her own spouse had been turned?      But we neo-pagans may not after all be abandoned entirely:        Yet there is speeding a god mercifully over the earth,      Quick and assiduous. Everyone knows him and ought to adore him,        Herald of Zeus: Hermes, the healing god.      Although his father's temple be fallen, and though of its pillars        Scarcely a pair yet records ancient glory adored,      Nevertheless the son's place of worship still stands, and forever        Will there the ardent requests alternate with the thanks.      Only one favor I beg of you, Graces (I ask it in secret--        Fervent my prayer and deep, out of a passionate breast):      My little garden, my sweet one, protect it and do not let any        Evil come near it nor me. Cupid will hold out his hand:      O, and entrusting myself to the rascal, I beg you please may I        Do so in pleasure with no danger or worry or fear.          XVIII      I cannot think I'd have gone with Julius Caesar to Britain;        To the Popina right here, Florus would tug me with ease.      Fogs of the dreary north remain a more baleful remembrance        Than in the kitchens of Rome tribes of assiduous fleas.      After today, I'll remember you even more kindly, tavernas,        You osterias, as you are called, aptly by those here in Rome.      That was the place I encountered my mistress today with the uncle        Whom she so often deceives, so that she can have me.      Here's where I sat at a table surrounded by good-natured Germans;        Over on that side the girl, finding a seat for herself      Next to her mother where, frequently shifting her bench, she arranged        Nicely for me to perceive profile and curve of her neck;      Speaks just a little more loudly than women in Rome are accustomed;        Significant glance as she pours--misses the glass with the wine      So that it spills on the table, and she with a delicate finger        Over its surface can draw circles in damp arabesque:      Her name entwining in mine, while my eyes most eagerly follow        All that her fingertip writes. She is of course well aware      That I am watching, so finally makes the V of the Roman        Five, with a virgule before. Quickly, as soon as I've seen,      She interlaces the circles, reducing them all to ornatest        Patterns--but still the sweet IV stood as engraved in my eye.      I sat there mutely and biting my passionate lips almost bloody        Half from delight at the ruse, partly from stifled desire:      Such a long time until dark, then another four hours of waiting.        --Sun, who tarries on high, contemplating Rome:      Greater never you've nor shall you in future see greater        Than Rome, O sun, as your priest, Horace, enraptured foretold.      Tarry no longer today. Go seek other realms beneath heaven.        Sooner depart and leave Rome's seven famed hills to me.      Please do the poet a favor and shorten the glorious hours        Which the painter devours, eagerly filling his eyes.      Cast now but one ardent glance, while descending, on noble facades and        Cupolas, pillars, and--last--up at the obelisks. Then      Hastily plunge to the ocean. Come view all the sooner tomorrow        That which, for centuries now, gods have let you enjoy:      Italy's shoreline so long overgrown with moist reeds, elevations        Somberly rising to shades cast by the bushes and trees.      First were but few simple dwellings here, suddenly sunlight discovered        Nations enlivening hills teeming with fortunate thieves.      Onto this spot they assembled such plunder, in your eye so splendid        All earth's remaining orb scarcely was worthy of note.      You watched a world being born here, watched the same world sink to ruin,        And from those ruins yet arise world again greater, perhaps.      O may I long by your light now behold this Rome. May the Parcae        Spin the fine thread of my life slowly, taking great care.      O but come rushing the moment my love designated so sweetly.        Wonderful! Sound already the chimes? --No, but I heard at least three.      Thus, my dear muses, again you've beguiled the monotony for me.        Of this long interval while I was apart from my love.      All of you now, farewell! I'll be going now--don't be offended.        For, though you're proud, you'll concede: Cupid in my heart comes first.          XIX      Why did you fail to appear at the cot in the vineyard today, Love?        As I had promised I would, long I awaited you there.      \"Dear, I had almost arrived when I saw, by good fortune, your uncle        Standing right there by the vines, looking now this way, now that.      Stealthily I slipped away.\" --Alas, what a misapprehension!        You saw the scarecrow, that's all. Nothing else drove you away.      Reeds and some discarded garments all hastily cobbled together--        I helped to make it myself: diligent in my own grief.      \"Well, now his wish is fulfilled. The old gardner's most dissolute crow has        Left on this day unscathed nice little garden and niece.\"          XX      While there is many an unpleasant sound, I hate to hear barking        Worse than anything else. Bellowing dogs split my ears.      Nevertheless I do like to hear, and take pleasure in listening        To the loud howl of the dog raised from a pup next door.      That is the dog that so bayed one time at my girl that he almost        Gave our secret away (when she was visiting me).      Now, when I hear the dog barking I think my beloved is coming--        Or I remember the time, when long awaited she came.          XXI      I can tell not only about a discomfort far greater than others,        But of a horror besides,"]]]
