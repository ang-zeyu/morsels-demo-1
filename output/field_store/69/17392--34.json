[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5762"],[0,"Grammar and Vocabulary of the Lau Language, Solomon Islands (#3)"],[1," third are generally  used together as subjects: _gami mi langi si saetamana_ we do not  know; but the short forms _gu_, _o_, _mi_, _mu_, _da_, may be used  alone as subjects: _gu si saea_ I do not know. The forms in _lu_ are  not used as a trial number, but denote a more restricted number of  persons.    3. _Nia_ is used as meaning, there is, it is: _efita fe bread nia  agamolu_, how many loaves have you? It may be used before a proper  name as the equivalent to a genitive: _ana maaedangi nia Abiathar_  in the days of Abiathar. When the meaning is, there is, it is, _nia_  is preceded by _e_: _na liqa gera enia ada_ they have their holes;  _ma te ai enia i luma_ there is only one person in the house; with  _na_ demonstrative added: _nia na_ that is it, that is so.    4. The form _ni_ is seen in _nifai_ what? where? It occurs in  certain phrases as meaning, it is, there is: _e uta ro si lio ni  agamu_ how is it ye are of two minds? _na light fuana noni ni maa_  the light of the body it is the eye.    5. The plural sign _gi_ is used with the forms in the plural but not  with those ending in _lu_: _gia gi fi dao na_ we have just come.    6. The forms in the plural third _igera_ and _gera_ are used as  equivalent to a plural article: _igera na judea_ the Jews.    7. The pronouns of the third person singular and plural may be used  of impersonal or inanimate things.    B.   PRONOUNS SUFFIXED TO VERBS OR TO PREPOSITIONS AS OBJECT.    Singular: (1) _nau_. (2) _oe_. (3) _a_.    Plural:    Inclusive: (1) _gia_, _golu_.    Exclusive: (1) _gami_, _gamelu_. (2) _gamu_, _gamolu_.               (3) _gera_, _da_, _dalu_.    Dual:    Inclusive: (1) _goro_.    Exclusive: (1) _gamere_. (2) _gamoro_. (3) _daro_.    1. Examples of usage are, _gera saegera sui_ they were all summoned,  _nia lea fonosia_ he went to get it. A second object of the verb  always appears in the suffixed pronoun singular and plural third:  _gu langi si adasia na ola_ I did not see a canoe, _gera gutafigera  na mwane gi_ they persecuted the men.  All prepositions governing  nouns have the pronoun suffixed as an anticipatory object in  agreement with the noun: _gera lea fonosia fera_ they went to harm  the land, _fafia si doo_ concerning the matter.    2. The verb _dori_ (to wish) has the pronoun suffixed where in Sa'a  none would be used: _nia langi si doria gwou ana_ he would not drink  (it) of it.    3. To _taifili_ (alone) the pronouns are suffixed: _te taifilia_ he  alone, _taifiligera_ they alone.    C.   PRONOUNS SUFFIXED TO NOUNS OR TO VERBAL NOUNS USED AS  PREPOSITIONS.    Singular: (1) _gu_. (2) _mu_. (3) _na_.    Plural:    Inclusive: (1) _gia_, _golu_.    Exclusive: (1) _gami_, _gamelu_. (2) _gamu_, _gamolu_. (3) _gera_,  _da_, _dalu_.    Dual:    Inclusive: (1) _goro_.    Exclusive: (1) _gamere_. (2) _gamoro_. (3) _dar      1. These are the pronouns denoting possession and they are suffixed  to a certain class of nouns only, those which denote names of parts  of the body, or of family relationship, or of things in close  relationship to the possessor.  In all other cases possession is  denoted by the use of the ordinary personal pronouns.    2. When things and not persons are in question _ni_ is used in place  of _da_ in plural third: _lea alua i fulini_ go and put them in  their places.    3. Of the plural forms those ending in _lu_ denote a restriction in  the number of the persons concerned.    4. These pronouns are also suffixed to the preposition _fua_ to,  used as a dative, to _afuta_ all, and to certain other words which  show a noun termination but which have no independent existence as  nouns: _otofa_ concerning, _oofa_ approaching to, enceinte, _sie_,  at the house of (in the vocabulary all such words are followed by a  hyphen); also to _mara_ of one's own accord, alone, _te taifilia  marana_ he alone; also to the verb _too_ to hit, _toogu_, _toona_,  hit me, etc.      DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS.    These are _na_, _ne_, this; _nena_, _nana_, _nane_, that.    1. These all follow a noun or a pronoun: _a mwela ne_ this person,  _nia nana_ that is it.    2. _Na_ is added after the negative _langi_: _langi na no_, not  that; and after _sui_ finished: _sui na_ that is finished.    3. _Go_ an adverb, there, is used as a demonstrative: _tefe doo go  ana_ only one thing, _inau go agu_ I for my part; _ne_ may be added,  _gone_ that, _inia gone_ that is so. _Ba_ means that, there: _diena  ba_ good! _bago_ is used following a noun or a pronoun: _a doo bago_  that person there.      INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS.    1. The words used are _ati_, who; _taa, tafa_, what. The personal  article _a_ makes _ati_ who, singular, _gerati_ plural.  Both _ti_  and _taa_ are nouns. The adverb _ba_ may be added to _ati_ for the  purpose of emphasis: _ati ba_ who? _Ti_ stands for the name of the  person and _ati_ means, what is the name? _ati mwane_ what man? The  demonstrative _ne_ may be added for emphasis: _ati ne_ who is it  then? _Ati_ has also an indefinite use: _ati susulia_ who knows?    2. With _taa_, _tafa_, the definite article _si_ may be used: _si  taa_ what, that which, _taa_ may follow the noun, _ta si doo taa_  what sort of thing? _si doo taa ne_ what? The adverb _fai_ (where)  may be used as an interrogative pronoun: _nifai_ which, what?      INDEFINITE PRONOUNS.    The uses of _ta_, _te__, have been dealt with under \"articles.\"  These two words are used as signifying, any, some, other.    The noun _sai_ place, thing, has an indefinite use: _sai ai_ that  which, what, _sai na_ that which, _ta sai ai_, one, another (of  things), _sai oe_ your place, your duty, _tani oto ni sai ai_ some  people. (The Rev. A. I. Hopkins states in a note that _sai_ in Lau  is used of food only).      RELATIVE PRONOUNS.    There are no relative pronouns. Their place is supplied by various  locutions.    1. By the suffixed pronoun: _inia nane gu bae kekerofana fasi uri_  this is he of whom I spoke. The addition of the demonstrative _ne,  nena_, serves to make the meaning clearer: _inia nena ai garni mi  maasia_ he is the person for whom we are waiting.    2. By making use of a coordinate clause: _igami ne too gera ada  fuada na_ we are the people whom they have chosen.      POSSESSIVES.    Singular: (1) _agu_. (2) _amu_. (3) _ana_.    Plural:    Inclusive: (1) _aga_, _agolu_.    Exclusive: (1) _agami_, _agamelu_. (2) _agamu_, _agamolu_.               (3) _agera_, _ada_, _adalu_.    Dual:    Inclusive: (1) _agoro_.    Exclusive: (1) _agamere_. (2) _agamoro_. (3) _adaro_.    The possessive is used:    1. Of things to eat and drink: _si fangala agu_ something for me to  eat, _o ngalia amu_ take it for your eating, _si doo ana gera priest  tafiligera_ food for the priests only.    When the sense relates to food in general and not to a particular  meal the ordinary personal pronouns are employed as possessives: _si  doo ni gwou inau_ a drink for me.    2. As meaning, for me, for my part, etc., belonging to, at, with:  _geni agu_ a wife for me, _nia lea ana_ he went his way, _gu ka gele  dau go agu_ if I but touch, _fuana ngalia fera nia agolu_ to get his  land for ourselves, _si mamana nia ana_ power in himself, his power,  _si doo oro agu_ I have many things, _e langi ana_ not in it, lost,  _nia soe agera_ he questioned them, _soea satana ana a doo bago_ ask  so-and-so his name, _nia ledia tasi doo agu_ he asked me about  something, _ooganga agera_ their debt.    3. As the object of a neuter verb (i. e., a verb which does not take  a transitive suffix): _gera da qele ana_ they marvelled at him, _gu  ingo amu_ I beseech thee, _dau agu_ touch me, _bota ana_ blessed is  he.    4. With verbs when the object is separated from the verb: _nia bubu  tete adalu_ he regarded them fixedly, _ka lugatai saufini ana_ let  him go secretly, _da bae aisile ana_ they spoke scornfully of him:  _ala meme gamu_ to bite and rend you, is a variant.    5. To express, of, from, among: _ati mwane agamu_ what man of you?    6. The forms ending in _lu_ denote a restriction in the number of  the people concerned.    7. The adverb _afoa_ apart is also followed by the possessive: _afoa  ana_ apart from him.    8. It will be seen that the one possessive in Lau does the work of  the three that are used in Sa'a.   A Port Adam man asking for a wife  at Sa'a and saying _geni ana_ (as has happened at times) would be  asked whether he wanted to eat her--the Sa'a use being _keni nana_,  _'ana_ being reserved of things to eat.      ADJECTIVES.    1. Words which are qualifying terms may also be used in the form of  verbs, but some may be used without verbal particles and follow the  qualified word. _Mwane baita_ a big man, _mwela tou_ a little child.    2. Some words have a form which is used only of adjectives, either  of termination or of prefix.    a. Adjectival terminations are: _a_, _la_.    The termination _a_ is suffixed to substantives and verbs: _rodo_  night, _rorodoa_ dark, darkness, cloud; _bulu_ to be black,  _bubulua_ black.    _La_ is suffixed to substantives and verbs: _mwai_ a bag, _mwaila_  rich, _kobu_ to be fat, _kobukobula_ fat, whole, big; _tagalo_ to be  wandering, _tagalola_ matted, thick, of forest.    b. Adjectival prefixes are _a_, _ma_, _tata_, _m_. These are all  prefixed to verbs.    The _a_ is prefixed to verbs to form participles: _luga_ to loose,  _aluga_ loose; _la_ to lift up, _alaa_ upwards, up.    _Ma_ denotes condition: _lingi_ to pour, _malingi_ spilled, _ngi_ to  divide, _mangisingisi_ broken, divided, _matala_ only, merely; _tefe  mwela matala_ an only child.    _Tata_ denotes spontaneity: _tatagwelu_ headlong.    _M_ as a prefix appears to be used in the word _moi_ broken, (Sa'a  _'o'i_ to break, _ma'o'i_ broken).    3. Comparison: Degrees of comparison are shown by the use of  prepositions or adverbs, or by a simple positive statement. The  prepositions used are _fasi_ from, _tasa_ beyond, in excess. The  suffixed pronoun is used with _fasi_, but the possessive is used  with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5767"],[0,"The Fireside Chats of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (#3)"],[1,"between government and  farming and industry and transportation, not partnership in  profits, for the profits still go to the citizens, but rather a  partnership in planning and partnership to see that the plans are  carried out.    Let me illustrate with an example.  Take the cotton goods industry.  It is probably true that ninety percent of the cotton manufacturers  would agree to eliminate starvation wages, would agree to stop long  hours of employment, would agree to stop child labor, would agree  to prevent an overproduction that would result in unsalable  surpluses.  But, what good is such an agreement if the other ten  percent of cotton manufacturers pay starvation wages, require long  hours, employ children in their mills and turn out burdensome  surpluses?  The unfair ten percent could produce goods so cheaply  that the fair ninety percent would be compelled to meet the unfair  conditions.  Here is where government comes in.  Government ought to  have the right and will have the right, after surveying and  planning for an industry to prevent, with the assistance of the  overwhelming majority of that industry, unfair practice and to  enforce this agreement by the authority of government.  The so-  called anti-trust laws were intended to prevent the creation of  monopolies.  That purpose of the anti-trust laws must be continued,  but these laws were never intended to encourage the kind of unfair  competition that results in long hours, starvation wages and  overproduction.    The same principle applies to farm products and to transportation  and every other field of organized private industry.    We are working toward a definite goal, which is to prevent the  return of conditions which came very close to destroying what we  call modern civilization.  The actual accomplishment of our purpose  cannot be attained in a day.  Our policies are wholly within  purposes for which our American constitutional government was  established 150 years ago.    I know that the people of this country will understand this and  will also understand the spirit in which we are undertaking this  policy.  I do not deny that we may make mistakes of procedure as we  carry out the policy.  I have no expectation of making a hit every  time I come to bat.  What I seek is the highest possible batting  average, not only for myself but for the team.  Theodore Roosevelt  once said to me:  \"If I can be right 75 percent of the time I shall  come up to the fullest measure of my hopes.\"    Much has been said of late about federal finances and inflation,  the gold standard, etc.  Let me make the facts very simple and my  policy very clear.  In the first place, government credit and  government currency are really one and the same thing.  Behind  government bonds there is only a promise to pay.  Behind government  currency we have, in addition to the promise to pay, a reserve of  gold and a small reserve of silver.  In this connection it is worth  while remembering that in the past the government has agreed to  redeem nearly thirty billions of its debts and its currency in  gold, and private corporations in this country have agreed to  redeem another sixty or seventy billions of securities and  mortgages in gold.  The government and private corporations were  making these agreements when they knew full well that all of the  gold in the United States amounted to only between three and four  billions and that all of the gold in all of the world amounted to  only about eleven billions.    If the holders of these promises to pay started in to demand gold  the first comers would get gold for a few days and they would  amount to about one twenty-fifth of the holders of the securities  and the currency.  The other twenty-four people out of twenty-five,  who did not happen to be at the top of the line, would be told  politely that there was no more gold left.  We have decided to treat  all twenty-five in the same way in the interest of justice and the  exercise of the constitutional powers of this government.  We have  placed everyone on the same basis in order that the general good  may be preserved.    Nevertheless, gold, and to a partial extent silver, are perfectly  good bases for currency and that is why I decided not to let any of  the gold now in the country go out of it.    A series of conditions arose three weeks ago which very readily  might have meant, first, a drain on our gold by foreign countries,  and second, as a result of that, a flight of American capital, in  the form of gold, out of our country.  It is not exaggerating the  possibility to tell you that such an occurrence might well have  taken from us the major part of our gold reserve and resulted in  such a further weakening of our government and private credit as to  bring on actual panic conditions and the complete stoppage of the  wheels of industry.    The administration has the definite objective of raising commodity  prices to such an extent that those who have borrowed money will,  on the average, be able to repay that money in the same kind of  dollar which they borrowed.  We do not seek to let them get such a  cheap dollar that they will be able to pay back a great deal less  than they borrowed.  In other words, we seek to correct a wrong and  not to create another wrong in the opposite direction.  That is why  powers are being given to the administration to provide, if  necessary, for an enlargement of credit, in order to correct the  existing wrong.  These powers will be used when, as, and if it may  be necessary to accomplish the purpose.    Hand in hand with the domestic situation which, of course, is our  first concern, is the world situation, and I want to emphasize to  you that the domestic situation is inevitably and deeply tied in  with the conditions in all of the other nations of the world.  In  other words, we can get, in all probability, a fair measure of  prosperity to return in the United States, but it will not be  permanent unless we get a return to prosperity all over the world.    In the conferences which we have held and are holding with the  leaders of other nations, we are seeking four great objectives:  First, a general reduction of armaments and through this the  removal of the fear of invasion and armed attack, and, at the same  time, a reduction in armament costs, in order to help in the  balancing of government budgets and the reduction of taxation;  second, a cutting down of the trade barriers, in order to restart  the flow of exchange of crops and goods between nations; third, the  setting up of a stabilization of currencies, in order that trade  can make contracts ahead; fourth, the reestablishment of friendly  relations and greater confidence between all nations.    Our foreign visitors these past three weeks have responded to these  purposes in a very helpful way.  All of the nations have suffered  alike in this great depression.  They have all reached the  conclusion that each can best be helped by the common action of  all.  It is in this spirit that our visitors have met with us and  discussed our common problems.  The international conference that  lies before us must succeed.  The future of the world demands it and  we have each of us pledged ourselves to the best joint efforts to  this end.    To you, the people of this country, all of us, the Members of the  Congress and the members of this administration, owe a profound  debt of gratitude.  Throughout the depression you have been patient.  You have granted us wide powers; you have encouraged us with a  widespread approval of our purposes.  Every ounce of strength and  every resource at our command we have devoted to the end of  justifying your confidence.  We are encouraged to believe that a  wise and sensible beginning has been made.  In the present spirit of  mutual confidence and mutual encouragement we go forward.        July 24, 1933.      After the adjournment of the historical special session of the  Congress five weeks ago I purposely refrained from addressing you  for two very good reasons.    First, I think that we all wanted the opportunity of a little quiet  thought to examine and assimilate in a mental picture the crowding  events of the hundred days which had been devoted to the starting  of the wheels of the New Deal.    Secondly, I wanted a few weeks in which to set up the new  administrative organization and to see the first fruits of our  careful planning.    I think it will interest you if I set forth the fundamentals of  this planning for national recovery; and this I am very certain  will make it abundantly clear to you that all of the proposals and  all of the legislation since the fourth day of March have not been  just a collection of haphazard schemes but rather the orderly  component parts of a connected and logical whole.    Long before inauguration day I became convinced that individual  effort and local effort and even disjointed federal effort had  failed and of necessity would fail and, therefore, that a rounded  leadership by the federal government had become a necessity both of  theory and of fact.  Such leadership, however, had its beginning in  preserving and strengthening the credit of the United States  government, because without that no leadership was a possibility.  For years the government had not lived within its income.  The  immediate task was to bring our regular expenses within our  revenues.  That has been done.    It may seem inconsistent for a government to cut down its regular  expenses and at the same time to borrow and to spend billions for  an emergency.  But it is not inconsistent because a large portion of  the emergency money has been paid out in the form of sound loans  which will be repaid to the treasury over a period of years; and to  cover the rest of the emergency money we have imposed taxes to pay  the interest and the installments on that part of the debt.    So you will see that we have kept our credit good."]]]
