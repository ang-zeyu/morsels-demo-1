The new cemetery, surrounded by a tall stone wall and approached  by a large locked gate, contains only four tombs; the old burial  ground opposite is unwalled, open, and painfully crowded; the  trees have run wild, the crosses cumber the ground, the  gravestones are tilted up and down; in fact the foul Golgotha of  Santos, São Paulo, the Brazil, is not more ragged, shabby, and  neglected. We were shown the last resting-place of M. du Chaillu  pere, agent to Messrs. Oppenheim, the old Parisian house: he died  here in 1856.    Resuming our way parallel with, but distant from the river, we  passed a bran-new military storehouse, bright with whitewash.  Outside the compound lay the lines of the \"Zouaves,\" some forty  negroes whom Goree has supplied to the Gaboon; they were  accompanied by a number of intelligent mechanics, who loudly  complained of having been kidnapped, coolie-fashion. We then  debouched upon Fort Aumale; from the anchorage it appears a  whitewashed square, whose feet are dipped in bright green  vegetation, and its head wears a dingy brown roof-thatch. A  nearer view shows a pair of semi-detached houses, built upon  arches, and separated by a thoroughfare; the cleaner of the two  is a hospital; the dingier, which is decorated with the brown-  green stains, the normal complexion of tropical masonry, lodges  the station Commandant and the medical officers. Fronting the  former and by the side of an avenue that runs towards the sea is  an unfinished magazine of stone, and to the right, as you front  the sun, lies the garden of the \"Commandant du Comptoir,\" choked  with tropical weeds. Altogether there is a scattered look about  the metropolis of the \"Gabon,\" which numbers one foot of house to  a thousand of \"compound.\"    Suddenly a bonnet like a pair of white gulls wings and a blue  serge gown fled from us, despite the weight of years, like a  young gazelle; the wearer was a sister of charity, one of five  bonnes surs. Their bungalow is roomy and comfortable, near a  little chapel and a largish school, whence issue towards sunset  the well-known sounds of the Angelus. At some distance down  stream and on the right or northern bank lies a convent, and a  house superintended by the original establisher of the mission in  1844, the bishop, Mgr. Bessieux, who died in 1872, aged 70. There  are extensive plantations, but the people are too lazy to take  example from them.    Before we hear the loud cry à table, we may shortly describe the  civilized career of the Gaboon. In 1842, when French and English  rivalry, burning hot on both sides of the Channel, extended deep  into the tropics and spurned the equator, and when every naval  officer, high and low, went mad about concluding treaties and  conquering territory on paper, France was persuaded to set up a  naval station in Gorilla-land. The northern and the southern  shore each had a king, whose consent, after a careless fashion,  was considered decorous. His Majesty of the North was old King  Glass[FN#1] and his chief \"tradesman,\" that is, his premier, was  the late Toko, a shrewd and far-seeing statesman. His Majesty of  the South was Rapwensembo, known to the English as King William,  to the French as Roi Denis.    Matters being in this state, M. le Comte Bouët-Willaumez, then  Capitaine de Vaisseau and Governor of Senegal, resolved, coûte  que coûte, to have his fortified Comptoir. Evidently the northern  shore was preferable; it was more populous and more healthy,  facing the fresh southerly winds. During the preliminary  negotiations Toko, partial to the English, whose language he  spoke fluently, and with whom the Glass family had ever been  friendly, thwarted the design with all his might, and, despite  threats and bribes, honestly kept up his opposition to the last.  Roi Denis, on the other hand, who had been decorated with the  Légion d'Honneur for saving certain shipwrecked sailors, who knew  French well, and who hoped to be made king of the whole country,  favoured to the utmost Gallic views, taking especial care,  however, to place the broad river between himself and his white  friends. M. de Moleon, Capitaine de Frégate, and commanding the  brig \"Le Zèbre,\" occupied the place, Mr. Wilson[FN#2](\"Western  Africa,\" p. 254) says by force of arms, but that is probably an  exaggeration. To bring our history to an end, the sons of Japheth  overcame the children of Ham, and, as the natives said, \"Toko he  muss love Frenchman, all but out of (anglicè 'in') his heart.\"    As in the streets of Paris, so in every French city at home and  abroad,      \"Verborum vetus interit ætas,\"    and an old colonial chart often reads like a lesson in modern  history. Here we still find under the Empire the Constitutional  Monarchy of 1842-3. Mount Bouët leads to Fort \"Aumale:\" Point  Joinville, at the north jaw of the river, faces Cap Montagnies:  Parrot has become \"Adelaide,\" and Coniquet \"Orleans\" Island.  Indeed the love of Louis-Philippe's family has lingered in many a  corner where one would least expect to meet it, and in 1869 I  found \"Port Saeed\" a hot-bed of Orleanism.    The hotel verandah was crowded with the minor officials, the  surgeons, and the clerks of the comptoir, drinking absinthe and  colicky vermouth, smoking veritable \"weeds,\" playing at dominoes,  and contending who could talk longest and loudest. At 7 P.M. the  word was given to \"fall to.\" The room was small and exceedingly  close; the social board was big and very rickety. The clientèle  rushed in like backwoodsmen on board a Mississippi floating-  palace, stripped off their coats, tucked up their sleeves, and,  knife in one hand and bread in the other, advanced gallantly to  the fray. They began by quarrelling about carving; one made a  sporting offer to découper la soupe, but he would go no farther;  and Madame, as the head of the table, ended by asking my  factotum, Selim Agha, to \"have the kindness.\" The din, the heat,  the flare of composition candles which gave 45 per cent. less of  light than they ought, the blunders of the slaves, the  objurgations of the hostess, and the spectacled face opposite me,  were as much as I could bear, and a trifle more. No wonder that  the resident English merchants avoid the table-d'hôte.    Provisions are dear and scarce at the Gaboon, where, as in other  parts of West Africa, the negro will not part with his animals,  unless paid at the rate of some twenty-two or twenty-three  shillings for a lean goat or sheep. Yet the dinner is copious;  the employés contribute, their rations; and thus the table shows  beef twice a week. Black cattle are imported from various parts  of the coast, north and south; perhaps those of the Kru country  stand the climate best; the Government yard is well stocked, and  the polite Commodore readily allows our cruizers to buy bullocks.  Madame also is not a \"bird with a long bill;\" the dinner,  including piquette, alias vin ordinaire, coffee, and the petit  verre, costs five francs to the stranger, and one franc less pays  the déjeuner a la fourchette--most men here eat two dinners. The  soi-disant Médoc (forty francs per dozen) is tolerable, and the  cassis (thirty francs) is drinkable. I am talking in the present  of things twelve years past. What a shadowy, ghostly table d'hôte  it has now become to me!    After dinner appeared cigar and pipe, which were enjoyed in the  verandah: I sat up late, admiring the intense brilliancy of the  white and blue lightning, but auguring badly for the future,--  natives will not hunt during the rains. A strong wind was blowing  from the north-east, which, with the north-north-east, is here,  as at Fernando Po and Camaronen, the stormy quarter. A \"dry  tornado,\" however, was the only result that night.    My trip to Gorilla-land was limited by the cruise upon which  H.M.S.S. \"Griffon\" had been ordered, namely, to and from the  South Coast with mail-bags. Many of those whom I had wished to  see were absent; but Mr. Hogg set to work in the most business-  like style. He borrowed a boat from the Rev. William Walker, of  the Gaboon Mission, who kindly wrote that I should have something  less cranky if I could wait awhile; he manned it with three of  his own Krumen, and he collected the necessary stores and  supplies of cloth, pipes and tobacco, rum, white wine, and  absinthe for the natives.    My private stores cost some 200 francs. They consisted of  candles, sugar, bread, cocoa, desiccated milk, and potatoes;  Cognac and Médoc; ham, sausages, soups, and preserved meats, the  latter French and, as usual, very good and very dear. The total  expenditure for twelve days was 300 francs.    My indispensables were reduced to three loads, and I had four  \"pull-a-boys,\" one a Mpongwe, Mwáká alias Captain Merrick, a  model sluggard; and Messrs. Smoke, Joe Williams, and Tom Whistle-  -Kru-men, called Kru-boys. This is not upon the principle, as  some suppose, of the grey-headed post-boy and drummer-boy: all  the Kraoh tribes end their names in bo, e.g. Worebo, from \"wore,\"  to capsize a canoe; Grebo, from the monkey \"gre\" or \"gle;\" and  many others. Bo became \"boy,\" even as Sipahi (Sepoy) became Sea-  pie, and Sukhani (steersman) Sea-Coney.    Gaboon is French, with a purely English trade. Gambia is English,  with a purely French trade; the latter is the result of many  causes, but especially of the large neighbouring establishments  at Goree, Saint Louis de Sénégal, and Saint Joseph de Galam.  Exchanging the two was long held the soundest of policy. The  French hoped by it to secure their darling object,--exclusive  possession of the maritime regions, as well as the interior,  leading to the gold mines of the Mandengas (Mandingas), and  allowing overland connection with their Algerine colony. The  English also seemed willing enough to \"swop\" an effete and  dilapidated settlement,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5761"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 2 (#3)"],[1,"of study with watching the huge  gulls, which are skinned and found good food at Fernando Po, and  in collecting the paper-nautilus. The Ocythoë Cranchii was often  found inside the shell, and the sea was streaked as with cotton-  flecks by lines of eggs several inches long, a mass of mucus with  fine membraneous structure adhering to the rocks, and coagulating  in spirits or salt water. The drum-fish was not heard except when  we were at anchor; its sound somewhat suggests a distant frog-  concert, and I soon learned to enjoy what M. Dufosse has  learnedly named \"ichthyopsophosis,\" the song of the fish. Passing  Cabinda, 57 miles from Loanda, but barely in sight, we fell in  with H.M. Steamship \"Espoir,\" Commander Douglas, who had just  made his second capture of a slave-schooner carrying some 500  head of Congos. In these advanced days, the representative man  walks up to you as you come on board; touches his cap or his  wool, and expresses his best thanks in West Coast English; when  you offer him a dram he compares it with the trade article which  \"only ting, he no burn.\" The characteristic sights are the  captured Moleques or negrokins, who, habited in sacks to the  knees, choose an M.C. to beat time, whilst they sing in chorus,  extending the right arm, and foully abusing their late masters,  who skulk about the forecastle.    Ten days sped by before we sighted the beginning of the end, Cape  Spilemberta and Dande Point, two bluffs in distinct serrations;  the aspect of the land was pleasant, a vista of tall cliffs,  white or red, rising wall-like from a purple sea, jagged with  sharp, black reef and \"diabolito,\" and bearing on the summit a  plateau well grown with grass and tree. We then opened a deep  bight, which has the honour of being entitled the longest  indentation from Cape Lopez to Great Fish Bay, some 17° or a  thousand miles of coast. A gap in the cliff line and darker  vegetation showed the Zenza River, generally called Bengo from  the district (Icolo e Bengo) which it traverses. Here was once a  busy settlement much frequented by shipping, which thus escaped  harbour dues. The mosquito-haunted stream, clear in the dries,  and, as usual, muddy during the rains, supports wild duck, and,  carried some ten miles in \"dongos\" or flat-bottomed boats,  supplies the capital of Angola with drinking water and dysentery.    As we glide towards the anchorage two features attract my  attention: the Morro or hill-ridge on the mainland, and the  narrow strip which forms the harbour. The escarpment, sweeping  from a meridian to a parallel, juts westward in the bluff Cape  Lagostas (Lobsters), a many-coloured face, in places not unlike  the white cliffs of Dover; it then trends from north-east to  south-west, bending at last in a picturesque bow, with a shallow  sag. The material is the tauá or blood-red marl of the Brazil,  banded with white and brown, green, chocolate, and yellow; huge  heaps of \"rotten earth,\" washed down by the rains, cumber the  base of the ruined sea-wall north of the town; in front is a  pellucid sea with the usual trimmings, while behind roll the  upland stubbles of autumn, here mottled black with fire, there  scattered with the wild ficus and the cashew, a traveller from  the opposite hemisphere.    The Ilha de Loanda, which gave its name to the city, according to  Mr. W. Winwood Reade (\"Savage Africa,\" chapter xxv.), is \"derived  from a native word meaning bald:\" I believe it to be the Angolan  Luánda, or tribute. Forming the best harbour of the South African  coast, it is made by the missionaries of the seventeenth century  to extend some ten leagues long. James Barbot's plan (A.D. 1700)  shows seven leagues by one in breadth, disposed from north-east  to south-west, and, in the latter direction, fitting into the  \"Mar Aparcelado\" or shoaly sea, a curious hook-shaped bight with  a southern entrance, the \"Barra de Curinba\" (Corimba). But the  influences which formed the island, or rather islands (for there  are two) have increased the growth, reducing the harbour to three  and a half miles by two in breadth, and they are still  contracting it; even in the early nineteenth century large ships  floated off the custom house, and it is dry land where boats once  rode. Dr. Livingstone (\"First Expedition,\" chapter xx.) believes  the causa causans to be the sand swept over the southern part of  the island: Douville more justly concludes that it is the gift of  the Cuanza River, whose mud and ooze, silt and débris are swept  north by the great Atlantic current. Others suppose that it  results from the meeting of the Cuanza and the Bengo streams; but  the latter outfall would be carried up coast. The people add the  washings of the Morro, and the sand and dust of the sea-shore  south of the city.    This excellent natural breakwater perfectly shelters the shipping  from the \"calemas,\" or perilous breakers on the seaward side, and  the surface is dotted with huts and groves, gardens and palm  orchards. At the Ponta do Norte once stood a fort appropriately  called Na. Sa. Flór de Rosa; it has wholly disappeared, but  lately, when digging near the sea, heaps of building stone were  found. Barbot here shows a \"toll-house to collect the customs,\"  and at the southern extremity a star-shaped \"Fort Fernand.\"    This island was the earliest of Portuguese conquests on this part  of the coast. The Conquistador Paulo Dias de Novaes, a grandson  of Bartholomeo Dias, was sent a second time, in A.D. 1575, to  treat with the king of \"Dongo,\" who caused trouble to trade.  Accompanied by 700 Portuguese, he reached the Cuanza River,  coasted north, and entered by the Barra de Corimba, then  accessible to caravels. He landed without opposition amongst a  population already Christianized, and, after occupying for a few  months the island, which then belonged to Congo, he founded,  during the next year, the Villa de São Paulo de Loanda on the  mainland.    The importance of the island arose from its being the great money  bank of the natives, who here collected the zimbo, buzio, cowrie,  or cypræa moneta. Ample details concerning this industry are  given by the old writers. The shell was considered superior to  the \"impure or Braziles,\" brought from the opposite Bahia (de  Todos os Santos), though much coarser than the small Indian, and  not better than the large blue Zanzibar. M. Du Chaillu (\"Second  Expedition,\" chap, iv.) owns to having been puzzled whence to  derive the four sacred cowries: \"They are unknown on the Fernand  Vaz, and I believe them to have come across the continent from  eastern Africa.\" There are, indeed, few things which have  travelled so far and have lasted so long as cowries--they have  been found even amongst \"Anglo-Saxon\" remains.    The modern Muxi-Loandas hold aloof from the shore-folk, who  return the compliment in kind. They dress comparatively well, and  they spend considerable sums in their half-heathen lembamentos  (marriages) and mutambé (funerals).    As might be expected, after three centuries of occupation, the  Portuguese, both in East and West Africa, have naturalized a  multitude of native words, supplying them with a Lusitanian  termination. The practice is very useful to the traveller, and  the despair of the lexicographer. During the matumbé the  relations \"wake\" the toasted, swaddled, and aromatized corpse  with a singular vigour of drink and general debauchery.    I arrived with curiosity at the capital of Angola, the first  Portuguese colony visited by me in West Africa. The site is  pleasing and picturesque, contrasting favourably with all our  English settlements and with the French Gaboon; for the first  time after leaving Teneriffe, I saw something like a city. The  escarpment and the sea-bordering shelf, allowing a double town  like Athenæ or Thebæ, a Cidade Alta and a Cidade Baixa, are  favourites with the Lusitanians from Lisbon to the China seas,  and African São Paulo is reflected in the Brazilian Bahia. So  Greece affected the Acropolis, and Rome everywhere sought to  build a Capitol. The two lines follow the shore from north-east  to south-west, and they form a graceful amphitheatre by bending  westward at the jutting headland, Morro de São Miguel, of old de  São Paulo. Three hundred years of possession have built forts and  batteries, churches and chapels, public buildings and large  private houses,white or yellow, withample green verandahs--each  an ugly cube, but massing well together. The general decline of  trade since 1825, and especially the loss of the lucrative slave  export, leave many large tenements unfinished or uninhabited,  while the aspect is as if a bombardment had lately    026--- taken place. Africa shows herself in heaps of filthy  hovels, wattle and daub and dingy thatch; in \"umbrella-trees\"  (ficus), acacias and calabashes, palms and cotton-trees, all  wilted, stunted, and dusty as at Cairo. We are in the latitude of  East African Kilwa and of Brazilian Pernambuco; but this is a  lee-land, and the suffering is from drought. Yet, curious to say,  the flora, as will appear, is here richer than in the well-  watered eastern regions.    Steaming onwards, at one mile off shore, we turned from south-  east to south-west, and presently rounded the north-east point of  Loanda Island, where a moored boat and a lantern showed the way.  We passed the first fort, São Pedro do Morro (da Cassandama),  which reminded me of the Aguada at the mouth of Goa Harbour. The  two bastions and their batteries date from A.D. 1700, and have  been useful in administering a strongish hint--in A.D. 1826 they  fired into Captain Owen. The next work is the little four-gun  work, Na. Sa. da Conceição. We anchored in five fathoms about  1,200 yards off shore, in company with some fifteen craft, large  and small, including a neat despatch cruizer, built after the  \"Nimrod\" model. Fort São Francisco, called \"do Penedo,\" because  founded upon and let into a rock,"]]]
