But the most material thing in breeding all animals, and to which  we pay the least regard, either in the race of men or Horses, is  the choice of the female, who not only joins in the production of  the foetus, but in the formation of it also. And that the female  has even the greatest share in the production of the foetus, will  be proved by this instance: if you take a dunghill cock and put to  a game hen, and also put a brother of that game hen to a sister of  the dunghill cock, those chickens bred from the game hen will be  found much superior to those chickens bred from the dunghill hen.    And here I beg leave to be allowed (without the imputation of  pedantry) one quotation from Virgil, who is supposed to have well  understood the laws of nature. In his description of the choice of  animals for procreation, in the third chapter of his Georgic's,  and the 49th verse, you will find it thus written:         \"Seu quis Olympiacea mieratus praemia palme,       \"Pascit Equos, feu quis fortes ad aratra Juvencos,       \"Corpora praecipue matrum legat.\"    But I should not escape the censure of the critics on this  occasion, I expect the thanks of all the handsome well-made women  in the kingdom, for this hint, who understand Latin; and where  they do not, I hope their paramours will instill the meaning of  it, as deeply as they can into them. But to return to the breeding  of Horses.    We pay little regard to the mechanism of the female, or of the  Horse to which we put her, but generally choose some particular  Horse for the sake of the cross, or because he is called an  Arabian; whereas, in fact, every Stallion will not be suited to  every Mare, but he who has a fine female, and judgment enough to  adapt her shapes with propriety to a fine male, will always breed  the best racer, let the sort of blood be what it will, always  supposing it to be totally foreign. The truth of this will be  confirmed by our observation, which shews us, that Horses do race,  and do not race, of all families and all crosses.    We find also, that affinity of blood in the brute creation, if not  continued too long in the same channel, is no impediment to the  perfection of the animal, for experience teaches us, it will hold  good many years in the breed of game cocks. Besides, we know that  Childers, which was perhaps the best racer ever bred in this  kingdom, had in his veins a consanguinity of blood; his pedigree  informing us, that his great grandam was got by Spanker, the dam  of which Mare was also the dam of the said Spanker.    If we inquire a little farther into the different species of the  creation, we shall find this principle concerning perfection of  shape still more verified. Amongst game cocks we shall find, that  wheresoever power and propriety of shape prevails most, that side  (condition alike) will generally prevail. We shall find also, that  one cock perfectly made, will beat two or three of his own  brothers imperfectly made. If any man should boast of the blood of  his cocks, and say that the uncommon virtue of this animal, which  we call game, is innate, I answer no, for that all principles, and  all ideas arise from sensation and reflection, and are therefore  acquired.    We perceive this spirit of fighting in game chicken, which they  exert occasionally from their infancy; even so it is amongst  dunghill chickens, though not carried to that degree of  perseverance.    When arrived at maturity, we see these different birds will still  continue to fight if they meet; if I should be asked why the  perseverance of fighting in one does not continue to death, as in  the other, I answer, that from a different texture of the organs  of the body, different sensations will arise, and consequently  different effects be produced; and this will be proved by  instances from the best of those very cocks which are called game,  who (it is well know) when they suffer a variation in their  texture, or as cockers term it, become rotten, run away  themselves, and their descendants also; which sensation of fear  could not be produced by any alteration in the body, if this  principle of game was innate.    Amongst men, do we not perceive agility and strength stand forth  confessed in the fabric of their bodies? do not even the passions  and pleasures of mankind greatly depend on the organs of their  bodies? Amongst dogs, we shall find the foxhound prevailing over  all others in speed and in bottom; but if not in speed, in bottom  at least I hope it will be allowed. To what shall we impute this  perfection in him? Shall we impute it to his blood, or to that  elegance of form in which is found no unnecessary weight to  oppress the muscles, or detract from his ability of perseverance?  if to blood, from whence shall we deduce it? or from what origin  is it derived? Surely no man means more, when he talks of the  blood of foxhounds, than to intimate that they are descended from  such, whose ancestors have been eminent for their good  qualifications, and have shone conspicuous in the front of the  pack for many generations.    But allowing this system of blood to exist in hounds and Horses,  let us consider how inconsistently and differently we act with  respect to each; with respect to hounds, if when arrived at  maturity, we think them ill shaped and loosely made, we at once  dispose of them without any trial, well knowing they will not  answer our expectations: whereas, in Horses, let the shape be what  it will, we are persuaded to train, because the jockey says thay  are very HIGH-BRED. If we now compare the blood of Horses with  that of dogs, shall not we find the case to be similar? will not  the origin be as uncertain in Horses as in dogs? it is true, in  some foreign countries they have long pedigrees of their Horses as  well as we, but what proofs have they themselves of this  excellence of the blood in one Horse more than another of the same  country? I never heard they made any trial of their Horses in the  racing way, but if they did, their decision would be as uncertain  as ours with respect to the blood, because their decision must be  determined by events alone, and therefore, by no means a proper  foundation whereon to build a system, or establish a fact, which  can be accounted for by causes.    The jockeys have an expression which, if this system be true, is  the most senseless imaginable: I have heard it often said, Such a  Horse has speed enough if his heart do but lie in the right place.  In answer to this, let us consider a Horse as a piece of animated  machinery (for it is in reality no other); let us set this piece  of machinery going, and strain the works of it; if the works are  are** not analogous to each other, will not the weakest give way?  and when that happens, will not the whole be out of tune? But if  we suppose a piece of machinery, whose works bear a true  proportion and analogy to each other, these will bear a greater  stress, will act with greater force, more regularity and  continuance of time. If it be objected, that foreign Horses seldom  race themselves, and therefore it must be in the blood, I think  nothing more easily answered; for we seldom see any of these  Horses sent us from abroad, especially from Arabia, but what are  more or less disproportioned, crooked, and deformed in some part  or other; and when we see this deformity of shape, can we any  longer wonder at their inability of racing: add to this, many of  them are perhaps full-aged before they arrive in this kingdom;  whereas, it is generally understood, that a proper training from  his youth is necessary to form a good racer.    But be this as it will, let us consider how it happens, that these  awkward, cross-shaped, disproportioned Horses, seemingly contrary  to the laws of nature, beget Horses of much finer shapes than  themselves, as we daily see produced in this Kingdom. And here I  acknowledge myself to have been long at a loss how to account for  this seeming difficulty.    I have been often conversant with travelers, concerning the nature  and breed of these Horses; few of whom could give any account of  the matter, from having had no taste therein, or any delight in  that animal: but, at length, I became acquainted with a gentleman  of undoubted veracity; whose word may be relied on, whose taste  and judgment in Horses inferior to no man's.    He says, that having spent a considerable part of his life at  Scanderoon and Alleppo**, he frequently made excursions amongst  the Arabs; excited by curiosity, as well as to gratify his  pleasures. (The Arabs, here meant, are subjects of the grand  seignior**, and receive a stipend from that court, to keep the  wild Arabs in awe, who are a fierce banditti**, and live by  plunder.) He says also, that these stipendiary Arabs are a very  worthy set of people, exactly resembling another worthy set of  people we have in England called Lawyers; for that they receive  fees from both parties; and when they can do it with impunity,  occasionally rob themselves.  These Arabs encamp on the deserts  together in large numbers, and with them moves all their  houshold**; that these people keep numbers of greyhound, for the  sake of coursing the game and procuring their subsistance: and  that he has often been with parties for the sake of coursing  amongst those people, and continued with them occasionally for a  considerable space of time.  That by them you are furnished with  dogs and horses; for the use of which you give them a reward. He  says they live all together; men, horses, dogs, colts, women, and  children. That these colts, having no green herbage to feed upon  when taken from the mare, are brought up by hand, and live as the  children do; and that the older Horses have no other food, than  straw and choped** barley, which these Arabs procure from the  villages most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5713"],[0,"Tales of War (#3)"],[1,"truly  vain care only to be talked of in many mouths; they hysterically love  to be thought of, and the notice of mankind is to them a mirror which  reflects their futile postures. The admiration of fools they love, and  the praise of a slavelike people, but they would sooner be hated by  mankind than be ignored and forgotten as is their due. And the truly  selfish care only for their imperial selves.    Let us leave him to pass in thought from ruin to ruin, from wasted  field to field, from crater to crater; let us leave his fancy haunting  cemeteries in the stricken lands of the world, to find what glee he  can in this huge manifestation of his imperial will.    We neither know to what punishment he moves nor can even guess what  fitting one is decreed. But the time is surely appointed and the  place. Poor trifler with Destiny, who ever had so much to dread?          A Walk to the Trenches      To stand at the beginning of a road is always wonderful; for on all  roads before they end experience lies, sometimes adventure. And a  trench, even as a road, has its beginnings somewhere. In the heart of  a very strange country you find them suddenly. A trench may begin in  the ruins of a house, may run up out of a ditch; may be cut into a  rise of ground sheltered under a hill, and is built in many ways by  many men. As to who is the best builder of trenches there can be  little doubt, and any British soldier would probably admit that for  painstaking work and excellence of construction there are few to rival  Von Hindenburg. His Hindenburg line is a model of neatness and  comfort, and it would be only a very ungrateful British soldier who  would deny it.    You come to the trenches out of strangely wasted lands, you come  perhaps to a wood in an agony of contortions, black, branchless,  sepulchral trees, and then no more trees at all. The country after  that is still called Picardy or Belgium, still has its old name on the  map as though it smiled there yet, sheltering cities and hamlet and  radiant with orchards and gardens, but the country named Belgium--or  whatever it be--is all gone away, and there stretches for miles  instead one of the world's great deserts, a thing to take its place no  longer with smiling lands, but with Sahara, Gobi, Kalahari, and the  Karoo; not to be thought of as Picardy, but more suitably to be named  the Desert of Wilhelm. Through these sad lands one goes to come to the  trenches. Overhead floats until it is chased away an aeroplane with  little black crosses, that you can scarcely see at his respectful  height, peering to see what more harm may be done in the desolation  and ruin. Little flashes sparkle near him, white puffs spread out  round the flashes: and he goes, and our airmen go away after him;  black puffs break out round our airmen. Up in the sky you hear a faint  tap-tapping. They have got their machine guns working.    You see many things there that are unusual in deserts: a good road, a  railway, perhaps a motor bus; you see what was obviously once a  village, and hear English songs, but no one who has not seen it can  imagine the country in which the trenches lie, unless he bear a desert  clearly in mind, a desert that has moved from its place on the map by  some enchantment of wizardry, and come down on a smiling country.  Would it not be glorious to be a Kaiser and be able to do things like  that?    Past all manner of men, past no trees, no hedges, no fields, but only  one field from skyline to skyline that has been harrowed by war, one  goes with companions that this event in our history has drawn from all  parts of the earth. On that road you may hear all in one walk where is  the best place to get lunch in the City; you may hear how they laid a  drag for some Irish pack, and what the Master said; you may hear a  farmer lamenting over the harm that rhinoceroses do to his coffee  crop; you may hear Shakespeare quoted and La vie Parisienne.    In the village you see a lot of German orders, with their silly notes  of exclamation after them, written up on notice boards among the  ruins. Ruins and German orders. That turning movement of Von Kluck's  near Paris in 1914 was a mistake. Had he not done it we might have had  ruins and German orders everywhere. And yet Von Kluck may comfort  himself with the thought that it is not by his mistakes that Destiny  shapes the world: such a nightmare as a world-wide German domination  can have had no place amongst the scheme of things.    Beyond the village the batteries are thick. A great howitzer near the  road lifts its huge muzzle slowly, fires and goes down again, and  lifts again and fires. It is as though Polyphemus had lifted his huge  shape slowly, leisurely, from the hillside where he was sitting, and  hurled the mountain top, and sat down again. If he is firing pretty  regularly you are sure to get the blast of one of them as you go by,  and it can be a very strong wind indeed. One's horse, if one is  riding, does not very much like it, but I have seen horses far more  frightened by a puddle on the road when coming home from hunting in  the evening: one 12-inch howitzer more or less in France calls for no  great attention from man or beast.    And so we come in sight of the support trenches where we are to dwell  for a week before we go on for another mile over the hills, where the  black fountains are rising.          A Walk in Picardy      Picture any village you know. In such a village as that the trench  begins. That is to say, there are duck-boards along a ditch, and the  ditch runs into a trench. Only the village is no longer there. It was  like some village you know, though perhaps a little merrier, because  it was further south and nearer the sun; but it is all gone now. And  the trench runs out of the ruins, and is called Windmill Avenue. There  must have been a windmill standing there once.    When you come from the ditch to the trench you leave the weeds and  soil and trunks of willows and see the bare chalk. At the top of those  two white walls is a foot or so of brown clay. The brown clay grows  deeper as you come to the hills, until the chalk has disappeared  altogether. Our alliance with France is new in the history of man, but  it is an old, old union in the history of the hills. White chalk with  brown clay on top has dipped and gone under the sea; and the hills of  Sussex and Kent are one with the hills of Picardy.    And so you may pass through the chalk that lies in that desolate lane  with memories of more silent and happier hills; it all depends on what  the chalk means to you: you may be unfamiliar with it and in that case  you will not notice it; or you may have been born among those  thyme-scented hills and yet have no errant fancies, so that you will  not think of the hills that watched you as a child, but only keep your  mind on the business in hand; that is probably best.    You come after a while to other trenches: notice boards guide you, and  you keep to Windmill Avenue. You go by Pear Lane, Cherry Lane, and  Plum Lane. Pear trees, cherry trees and plum trees must have grown  there. You are passing through either wild lanes banked with briar,  over which these various trees peered one by one and showered their  blossoms down at the end of spring, and girls would have gathered the  fruit when it ripened, with the help of tall young men; or else you  are passing through an old walled garden, and the pear and the cherry  and plum were growing against the wall, looking southwards all through  the summer. There is no way whatever of telling which it was; it is  all one in war; whatever was there is gone; there remain to-day, and  survive, the names of those three trees only. We come next to Apple  Lane. You must not think that an apple tree ever grew there, for we  trace here the hand of the wit, who by naming Plum Lane's neighbour  \"Apple Lane\" merely commemorates the inseparable connection that  plum has with apple forever in the minds of all who go to modern war.  For by mixing apple with plum the manufacturer sees the opportunity of  concealing more turnip in the jam, as it were, at the junction of the  two forces, than he might be able to do without this unholy alliance.    We come presently to the dens of those who trouble us (but only for  our own good), the dugouts of the trench mortar batteries. It is noisy  when they push up close to the front line and play for half an hour or  so with their rivals: the enemy sends stuff back, our artillery join  in; it is as though, while you were playing a game of croquet, giants  hundreds of feet high, some of them friendly, some unfriendly,  carnivorous and hungry, came and played football on your croquet lawn.    We go on past Battalion Headquarters, and past the dugouts and  shelters of various people having business with History, past stores  of bombs and the many other ingredients with which history is made,  past men coming down who are very hard to pass, for the width of two  men and two packs is the width of a communication trench and sometimes  an inch over; past two men carrying a flying pig slung on a pole  between them; by many turnings; and Windmill Avenue brings you at last  to Company Headquarters in a dugout that Hindenburg made with his  German thoroughness.    And there, after a while, descends the Tok Emma man, the officer  commanding a trench mortar battery, and is given perchance a whiskey  and water, and sits on the best empty box that we have to offer, and  lights one of our cigarettes.    \"There's going to be a bit of a strafe at 5.30,\" he says.
