Klumpy-Dumpy fell  downstairs and yet he got a princess,\" and he thought at the moment of a  nice little Birch-tree growing out in the woods; to the Fir, that would  be a real charming princess.    \"Who is Klumpy-Dumpy?\" asked the Mice. So then the Fir-tree told the  whole fairy tale, for he could remember every single word of it; and the  little Mice jumped for joy up to the very top of the Tree. Next night  two more Mice came, and on Sunday two Rats, even; but they said the  stories were not interesting, which vexed the little Mice; and they,  too, now began to think them not so very amusing either.    \"Do you know only one story?\" asked the Rats.    \"Only that one,\" answered the Tree. \"I heard it on my happiest evening;  but I did not then know how happy I was.\"    \"It is a very stupid story. Don't you know one about bacon and tallow  candles? Can't you tell any larder stories?\"    \"No,\" said the Tree.    \"Then good-bye,\" said the Rats; and they went home.    At last the little Mice stayed away also; and the Tree sighed: \"After  all, it was very pleasant when the sleek little Mice sat around me and  listened to what I told them. Now that too is over. But I will take good  care to enjoy myself when I am brought out again.\"    But when was that to be? Why, one morning there came a quantity of  people and set to work in the loft. The trunks were moved, the Tree was  pulled out and thrown--rather hard, it is true--down on the floor, but a  man drew him toward the stairs, where the daylight shone.    \"Now a merry life will begin again,\" thought the Tree. He felt the fresh  air, the first sunbeam--and now he was out in the courtyard. All passed  so quickly, there was so much going on around him, that the Tree quite  forgot to look to himself. The court adjoined a garden, and all was in  flower; the roses hung so fresh and odorous over the balustrade, the  lindens were in blossom, the Swallows flew by, and said, \"Quirre-vit! my  husband is come!\" but it was not the Fir-tree that they meant.    \"Now, then, I shall really enjoy life,\" said he, exultingly, and spread  out his branches; but, alas! they were all withered and yellow. It was  in a corner that he lay, among weeds and nettles. The golden star of  tinsel was still on the top of the Tree, and glittered in the sunshine.    In the courtyard some of the merry children were playing who had danced  at Christmas round the Fir-tree, and were so glad at the sight of him.  One of the youngest ran and tore off the golden star.    \"Only look what is still on the ugly old Christmas tree!\" said he,  trampling on the branches, so that they all cracked beneath his feet.  And the Tree beheld all the beauty of the flowers, and the freshness in  the garden; he beheld himself, and wished he had remained in his dark  corner in the loft; he thought of his first youth in the woods, of the  merry Christmas Eve, and of the little Mice who had listened with so  much pleasure to the story of Klumpy-Dumpy.    \"'Tis over--'tis past!\" said the poor Tree. \"Had I but rejoiced when I  had reason to do so! But now 'tis past, 'tis past!\"    And the gardener's boy chopped the Tree into small pieces; there was a  whole heap lying there. The wood flamed up splendidly under the large  brewing copper, and it sighed so deeply! Each sigh was like a shot.    The boys played about in the court, and the youngest wore the gold star  on his breast which the Tree had had on the happiest evening of his  life. However, that was over now--the Tree gone, the story at an end.  All, all was over; every tale must end at last.          III. THE CHRISTMAS MASQUERADE*    * From \"The Pot of Gold\", copyright by Lothrop, Lee & Shepherd Co.    MARY E. WILKINS FREEMAN    On Christmas Eve the Mayor's stately mansion presented a beautiful  appearance. There were rows of different coloured wax candles burning in  every window, and beyond them one could see the chandeliers of gold  and crystal blazing with light. The fiddles were squeaking merrily, and  lovely little forms flew past the windows in time to the music.    There were gorgeous carpets laid from the door to the street, and  carriages were constantly arriving and fresh guests tripping over them.  They were all children. The Mayor was giving a Christmas Masquerade  tonight to all the children in the city, the poor as well as the rich.  The preparation for this ball had been making an immense sensation for  the last three months. Placards had been up in the most conspicuous  points in the city, and all the daily newspapers had at least a column  devoted to it, headed with \"THE MAYOR'S CHRISTMAS MASQUERADE,\" in very  large letters.    The Mayor had promised to defray the expenses of all the poor children  whose parents were unable to do so, and the bills for their costumes  were directed to be sent in to him.    Of course there was great excitement among the regular costumers of the  city, and they all resolved to vie with one another in being the most  popular, and the best patronized on this gala occasion. But the placards  and the notices had not been out a week before a new Costumer appeared  who cast all the others into the shade directly. He set up his shop on  the corner of one of the principal streets, and hung up his beautiful  costumes in the windows. He was a little fellow, not much bigger than  a boy of ten. His cheeks were as red as roses, and he had on a  long curling wig as white as snow. He wore a suit of crimson velvet  knee-breeches, and a little swallow-tailed coat with beautiful golden  buttons. Deep lace ruffles fell over his slender white hands, and he  wore elegant knee buckles of glittering stones. He sat on a high stool  behind his counter and served his customers himself; he kept no clerk.    It did not take the children long to discover what beautiful things he  had, and how superior he was to the other costumers, and they begun to  flock to his shop immediately, from the Mayor's daughter to the poor  ragpicker's. The children were to select their own costumes; the Mayor  had stipulated that. It was to be a children's ball in every sense of  the word.    So they decided to be fairies and shepherdesses, and princesses  according to their own fancies; and this new Costumer had charming  costumes to suit them.    It was noticeable that, for the most part, the children of the rich,  who had always had everything they desired, would choose the parts of  goose-girls and peasants and such like; and the poor children jumped  eagerly at the chance of being princesses or fairies for a few hours in  their miserable lives.    When Christmas Eve came and the children flocked into the Mayor's  mansion, whether it was owing to the Costumer's art, or their own  adaptation to the characters they had chosen, it was wonderful how  lifelike their representations were. Those little fairies in their short  skirts of silken gauze, in which golden sparkles appeared as they moved  with their little funny gossamer wings, like butterflies, looked like  real fairies. It did not seem possible, when they floated around to the  music, half supported on the tips of their dainty toes, half by their  filmy purple wings, their delicate bodies swaying in time, that they  could be anything but fairies. It seemed absurd to imagine that they  were Johnny Mullens, the washerwoman's son, and Polly Flinders, the  charwoman's little girl, and so on.    The Mayor's daughter, who had chosen the character of a goose-girl,  looked so like a true one that one could hardly dream she ever was  anything else. She was, ordinarily, a slender, dainty little lady rather  tall for her age. She now looked very short and stubbed and brown, just  as if she had been accustomed to tend geese in all sorts of weather. It  was so with all the others--the Red Riding-hoods, the princesses, the  Bo-Peeps and with every one of the characters who came to the Mayor's  ball; Red Riding-hood looked round, with big, frightened eyes, all ready  to spy the wolf, and carried her little pat of butter and pot of honey  gingerly in her basket; Bo-Peep's eyes looked red with weeping for the  loss of her sheep; and the princesses swept about so grandly in their  splendid brocaded trains, and held their crowned heads so high that  people half-believed them to be true princesses.    But there never was anything like the fun at the Mayor's Christmas ball.  The fiddlers fiddled and fiddled, and the children danced and danced on  the beautiful waxed floors. The Mayor, with his family and a few grand  guests, sat on a dais covered with blue velvet at one end of the dancing  hall, and watched the sport. They were all delighted. The Mayor's eldest  daughter sat in front and clapped her little soft white hands. She was  a tall, beautiful young maiden, and wore a white dress, and a little cap  woven of blue violets on her yellow hair. Her name was Violetta.    The supper was served at midnight--and such a supper! The mountains of  pink and white ices, and the cakes with sugar castles and flower gardens  on the tops of them, and the charming shapes of gold and ruby-coloured  jellies. There were wonderful bonbons which even the Mayor's daughter  did not have every day; and all sorts of fruits, fresh and candied. They  had cowslip wine in green glasses, and elderberry wine in red, and  they drank each other's health. The glasses held a thimbleful each; the  Mayor's wife thought that was all the wine they ought to have. Under  each child's plate there was a pretty present and every one had a basket  of bonbons and cake to carry home.    At four o'clock the fiddlers put up their fiddles and the children went  home; fairies and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],[0,"Dave Dawson at Singapore (#3)"],[1," water that was streaked and smeared with the gold of the blazing  sun. True, the rays of the sun bouncing off the rolling blue swells  seemed to shower up clusters of golden specks in all directions that  dazzled his eyes. But no matter how hard he strained his eyes he could  see not the slightest sign of a surface ship, to say nothing of the  telltale ribbon of smoke trailing back from her stacks. Eventually he  gave it up and turned to look at his pal again.    \"Is this some kind of a gag?\" he demanded. \"Or did you really see  something? Maybe it was just sunbeams dancing off the water, huh?\"    Freddy Farmer wiped a hand across his eyes, sighed and shrugged.    \"Maybe,\" he said in a puzzled voice. \"But, if so, it's the first time I  ever saw sunbeams send out dots and dashes.\"    \"Dots and dashes?\" Dave echoed. \"Did you catch any of them? The  letters, I mean?\"    \"Too fast,\" Freddy said with a shake of his head. \"And what little I  did catch didn't mean any letters in the Morse Code. But ... maybe I  was just seeing things. Sorry.\"    Dave grinned and winked, and turned front once more.    \"Think nothing of it, my little pal,\" he said. \"Even the best of us  make mistakes now and....\"    Dave clamped his lips shut on the last, sat up straight in the seat and  stared hard down at the water to his right and some four or five miles  away. Perhaps it actually was a sunbeam dancing back up at him, but for  a brief instant he was certain he had seen four or five rapid flashes  of light down on the surface of the water. Another moment and he was  positive beyond all shadow of a doubt. There was a light flashing down  there on the water. Rather it was the reflection of the sun's rays on a  heliograph mirror. However, the flashes were both long and short, and  Dave didn't have to look twice to realize perfectly well that some kind  of a message was being flashed from down there on the water.    \"But how, and who's doing it?\" Dave gulped out the question aloud.  \"Unless I'm completely nuts, or stone blind, there's nothing but water  down there. Hey, Freddy!\"    \"Yes, I see it, too,\" the English youth spoke up. \"Thought I'd let you  see it for yourself this time. What do you make of it, Dave? A bit  weird, isn't it?\"    \"And a lot more than that!\" Dave grunted and was uncomfortably  conscious of an eerie tingling at the back of his neck. \"I don't see a  darn thing else but water and that flashing light. Hey! Do you suppose  it could be a sheet of metal, or something, that's being caught by the  sun as it rides those swells?\"    \"It could be, but I'm sure it isn't!\" Freddy Farmer replied in a tight  voice. \"Dave, those are real dot and dash signals. Three dots--two  dashes, then one dot and four dashes. Neither of those are Morse Code  letters. Or International Morse, either. But, I'll eat my parachute  pack if those aren't some kind of signals.\"    \"Check and double check!\" Dave grunted and scowled.    On impulse he took his eyes off the strange flashing signals far below  and ahead, and twisting all the way around in the seat he took a good  look at the surrounding heavens. Finally, he lowered his eyes to meet  Freddy Farmer's puzzled gaze.    \"Notice something else, Freddy, that seems to be a little out of  whack?\" he asked.    The English born R.A.F. ace took a quick look around, and shook his  head.    \"Can't say I do,\" he said. \"Unless you mean us tooting around up here  for no apparent reason ... at least, not to us. Why? What do you mean?\"    Dave made a little gesture with one hand that included a sweep of the  surrounding air.    \"Just that,\" he said. \"Full of nothing but sky and air. How come? How  come we're the only plane that's burning gas and oil in these parts?  Why isn't there a sign of any Singapore Base planes out on patrol?  Particularly the U-boat patrol planes. Don't they care any more if  supply ships heading for Singapore get torpedoed? In short, where is  everybody?\"    \"By jove, that's right, Dave!\" Freddy Farmer breathed with a catch in  his voice. \"Of course, they may have scared U-boats and surface raiders  away from here for good, yet.... Yet you'd think they'd still maintain  some kind of daylight patrol just in case.\"    \"Took the words right out of my mouth,\" Dawson said with a grave nod.  \"Of course, it is the month of December, and maybe they've declared  a truce out here until Xmas comes and goes. But it's darn queer. No  planes in the air. No ships on the water. Even the Harkness is out of  sight, now. Just us.\"    \"And those queer light flashes down there,\" Freddy Farmer added. \"Dave!  I think we should....\"    \"Doggone right!\" Dave cut in and shoved the stick forward. \"We'll  take us a better look anyway. Hang on, pal! These Swordfish jobs lose  altitude in plenty hurry!\"          CHAPTER THREE    _The Voice of Doom_      Dave wasn't kidding when he said that an aerial torpedo carrying Fairey  Swordfish can go down in a hurry. The plane streaked seaward like a  meteor in high gear. Dave held it in its steep dive until the rolling  blue swells of the China sea came rushing up a little too close for  comfort. Skillfully working the controls, he leveled off and shot the  plane forward toward the spot where they had first noticed the weird  flashes of light.    There were no flashes of light to be seen now, however. There was  nothing but sun flooded rolling water. Dave stared hard, and so did  Freddy Farmer, too. But it was just a waste of eyesight for all the  good it did them.    \"That makes us nuts, Freddy!\" Dave sang out. \"I don't see a thing, do  you?\"    \"Not a thing!\" Freddy called to him. \"I fancy it must have been the  sun's rays playing tricks on the water.\"    \"Well, some trick, is all I've got to say,\" Dave grunted and climbed  the Swordfish slightly for a better look. \"The same combinations of  dots and dashes were repeated over and over again.\"    \"I know,\" Freddy said. \"Like a blasted call signal on the short-wave  radio. If they'd been different and jumbled up then you could put  it down to sunlight bouncing off the water, but ... _Dave!_ To the  left! To the left! See that spot of white water? Foam? Dave! There's  something there!\"    Dave had already snapped his eyes to the left and was staring at a  patch of foamy white water on the surface of the seemingly limitless  stretch of rolling blue. The white foamy patch was there for a very  good reason. It was the telltale wake left by a diving submarine. And  even as Dave realized that he caught sight of a long cigar shaped  shadow sliding forward just under the surface of the water.    \"That's a submarine, Dave!\" Freddy Farmer's excited voice confirmed  Dawson's belief at practically the same instant. \"It was on the surface  and signalling us, but we couldn't see anything but the flash signals.\"    \"Sure, so what?\" Dave growled and veered the Swordfish around toward  the shadow of the undersea craft. \"But why signal _us_? And, also, why  signal us and then dive when we start to come down? Our markings are  plain enough.\"    \"Maybe it's a German U-boat!\" Freddy cried excitedly.    \"Maybe,\" Dave said with a shrug. \"But it still doesn't make sense.  _Why_ was the guy signalling to us?\"    \"Maybe he wasn't signalling to us,\" Freddy Farmer ventured.    Dave snorted and made a little gesture with his free hand.    \"Then who was he signalling to?\" he demanded. \"The man in the moon  above us? I took a good look, Freddy. I'll swear on a ten foot stack  of bibles that we're the only plane aloft in these parts. No, that  underwater boat was signalling to us, and....\"    He left the rest hanging in midair as he suddenly saw the moving shadow  of the submarine grow clearer and clearer as it rose to the surface. A  moment later the surface of the blue water boiled white and the conning  tower mast and hatch rose up into view. Another moment and the whole  bridge and decks were awash. Like a man in a dream Dave blinked his  eyes at the strange sight. It was a submarine sure enough, but it  was of a type he had never seen in his life. And what was even more  astonishing, it was painted a dull greenish blue to make it blend in  well nigh perfectly with the surrounding waters.    \"Good Lord!\" Freddy Farmer gasped. \"What is it? Nazi, or one of our  new types? And look at those two bow guns, Dave. And.... Dave! Look  at those seamen spill out of that opened conning tower hatch! They're  coming out like blasted rabbits. Get closer to the thing. It's like  something out of a fairy story book.\"    Dave Dawson only half heard his friend's exclamations, for all of his  attention and his eyes were fixed on the strange craft just off and  below the left wings. Just as Freddy Farmer had said, the figures of  seamen were popping out of the opened conning tower hatch like rabbits  out of a hat. They looked neither German nor English. They were all  short and stocky, and they moved about as though operated by strings  held by invisible hands.    Wide eyed, Dave stared at them; watched them pop out and go scrambling  down the bridge ladder and forward toward the bow. And then things  happened so fast that both Dave and Freddy were too stunned and  paralyzed to even think, let alone move. The two forward guns were  swung around toward them, covers were ripped off, and in the next  instant the muzzle of each gun belched out smoke and flame, and the  Swordfish heeled over drunkenly on the opposite wings as though it had  crashed full out into an invisible brick wall suspended in the sky.    A thousand steel fists hammered against Dave's body and his brain  became filled with flashing white light. As though from a million miles  away he heard the wild, excited yells from Freddy Farmer's lips. He  heard also the scream of the Bristol Pegasus engine over-revving. And,  although he was not conscious of doing so, he reached out and cut the  ignition and hauled back the throttle with a single movement of his  hand.    Then, just as suddenly as the"]]]
