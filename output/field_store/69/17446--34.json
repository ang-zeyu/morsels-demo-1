[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],[0,"The Prince and Betty (#3)"],[1,"of the late Prince,  once a passably imposing mansion, there rose beside the harbor a  mammoth Casino of shining stone.    Imposing as was the exterior, it was on the interior that Mr. Scobell  more particularly prided himself, and not without reason. Certainly, a  man with money to lose could lose it here under the most charming  conditions. It had been Mr. Scobell's object to avoid the cheerless  grandeur of the rival institution down the coast. Instead of one large  hall sprinkled with tables, each table had a room to itself, separated  from its neighbor by sound-proof folding-doors. And as the building  progressed, Mr. Scobell's active mind had soared above the original  idea of domestic coziness to far greater heights of ingenuity. Each of  the rooms was furnished and arranged in a different style. The note of  individuality extended even to the _croupiers_. Thus, a man with  money at his command could wander from the Dutch room, where, in the  picturesque surroundings of a Dutch kitchen, _croupiers_ in the  costume of Holland ministered to his needs, to the Japanese room, where  his coin would be raked in by quite passable imitations of the Samurai.  If he had any left at this point, he was free to dispose of it under  the auspices of near-Hindoos in the Indian room, of merry Swiss  peasants in the Swiss room, or in other appropriately furnished  apartments of red-shirted, Bret Harte miners, fur-clad Esquimaux, or  languorous Spaniards. He could then, if a man of spirit, who did not  know when he was beaten, collect the family jewels, and proceed down  the main hall, accompanied by the strains of an excellent band, to the  office of a gentlemanly pawnbroker, who spoke seven languages like a  native and was prepared to advance money on reasonable security in all  of them.    It was a colossal venture, but it suffered from the defect from which  most big things suffer; it moved slowly. That it also moved steadily  was to some extent a consolation to Mr. Scobell. Undoubtedly it would  progress quicker and quicker, as time went on, until at length the  Casino became a permanent gold mine. But at present it was being  conducted at a loss. It was inevitable, but it irked Mr. Scobell. He  paced the island and brooded. His mind dwelt incessantly on the  problem. Ideas for promoting the prosperity of his nursling came to him  at all hours--at meals, in the night watches, when he was shaving,  walking, washing, reading, brushing his hair.    And now one had come to him as he stood looking at the view from the  window of his morning-room, listening absently to his sister Marion as  she read stray items of interest from the columns of the _New York  Herald_, and had caused him to utter the exclamation recorded at the  beginning of the chapter.           *       *       *       *       *    \"By Heck!\" he said. \"Read that again, Marion. I gottan idea.\"    Miss Scobell, deep in her paper, paid no attention. Few people would  have taken her for the sister of the financier. She was his exact  opposite in almost every way. He was small, jerky and aggressive; she,  tall, deliberate and negative. She was one of those women whom nature  seems to have produced with the object of attaching them to some man in  a peculiar position of independent dependence, and who defy the  imagination to picture them in any other condition whatsoever. One  could not see Miss Scobell doing anything but pour out her brother's  coffee, darn his socks, and sit placidly by while he talked. Yet it  would have been untrue to describe her as dependent upon him. She had a  detached mind. Though her whole life had been devoted to his comfort  and though she admired him intensely, she never appeared to give his  conversation any real attention. She listened to him much as she would  have listened to a barking Pomeranian.    \"Marion!\" cried Mr. Scobell.    \"A five-legged rabbit has been born in Carbondale, Southern Illinois,\"  she announced.    Mr. Scobell cursed the five-legged rabbit.    \"Never mind about your rabbits. I want to hear that piece you read  before. The one about the Prince of Monaco. Will--you--listen, Marion!\"    \"The Prince of Monaco, dear? Yes. He has caught another fish or  something of that sort, I think. Yes. A fish with 'telescope eyes,' the  paper says. And very convenient too, I should imagine.\"    Mr. Scobell thumped the table.    \"I've got it. I've found out what's the matter with this darned place.  I see why the Casino hasn't struck its gait.\"    \"_I_ think it must be the _croupiers_, dear. I'm sure I never  heard of _croupiers_ in fancy costume before. It doesn't seem  right. I'm sure people don't like those nasty Hindoos. I am quite  nervous myself when I go into the Indian room. They look at me so  oddly.\"    \"Nonsense! That's the whole idea of the place, that it should be  different. People are sick and tired of having their money gathered in  by seedy-looking Dagoes in second-hand morning coats. We give 'em  variety. It's not the Casino that's wrong: it's the darned island.  What's the use of a republic to a place like this? I'm not saying that  you don't want a republic for a live country that's got its way to make  in the world; but for a little runt of a sawn-off, hobo, one-night  stand like this you gotta have something picturesque, something that'll  advertise the place, something that'll give a jolt to folks' curiosity,  and make 'em talk! There's this Monaco gook. He snoops around in his  yacht, digging up telescope-eyed fish, and people talk about it.  'Another darned fish,' they say. 'That's the 'steenth bite the Prince of  Monaco has had this year.' It's like a soap advertisement. It works by  suggestion. They get to thinking about the Prince and his pop-eyed  fishes, and, first thing they know, they've packed their grips and come  along to Monaco to have a peek at him. And when they're there, it's a  safe bet they aren't going back again without trying to get a mess of  easy money from the Bank. That's what this place wants. Whoever heard  of this blamed Republic doing anything except eat and sleep? They used  to have a prince here 'way back in eighty-something. Well, I'm going to  have him working at the old stand again, right away.\"    Miss Scobell looked up from her paper, which she had been reading with  absorbed interest throughout tins harangue.    \"Dear?\" she said enquiringly.    \"I say I'm going to have him back again,\" said Mr. Scobell, a little  damped. \"I wish you would listen.\"    \"I think you're quite right, dear. Who?\"    \"The Prince. Do listen, Marion. The Prince of this island, His  Highness, the Prince of Mervo. I'm going to send for him and put him on  the throne again.\"    \"You can't, dear. He's dead.\"    \"I know he's dead. You can't faze me on the history of this place. He  died in ninety-one. But before he died he married an American girl, and  there's a son, who's in America now, living with his uncle. It's the  son I'm going to send for. I got it all from General Poineau. He's a  royalist. He'll be tickled to pieces when Johnny comes marching home  again. Old man Poineau told me all about it. The Prince married a girl  called Westley, and then he was killed in an automobile accident, and  his widow went back to America with the kid, to live with her brother.  Poineau says he could lay his hand on him any time he pleased.\"    \"I hope you won't do anything rash, dear,\" said his sister comfortably.  \"I'm sure we don't want any horrid revolution here, with people  shooting and stabbing each other.\"    \"Revolution?\" cried Mr. Scobell. \"Revolution! Well, I should say nix!  Revolution nothing. I'm the man with the big stick in Mervo. Pretty  near every adult on this island is dependent on my Casino for his  weekly envelope, and what I say goes--without argument. I want a  prince, so I gotta have a prince, and if any gazook makes a noise like  a man with a grouch, he'll find himself fired.\"    Miss Scobell turned to her paper again.    \"Very well, dear,\" she said. \"Just as you please. I'm sure you know  best.\"    \"Sure!\" said her brother. \"You're a good guesser. I'll go and beat up  old man Poineau right away.\"          CHAPTER III    JOHN      Ten days after Mr. Scobell's visit to General Poineau, John, Prince of  Mervo, ignorant of the greatness so soon to be thrust upon him, was  strolling thoughtfully along one of the main thoroughfares of that  outpost of civilization, Jersey City. He was a big young man, tall and  large of limb. His shoulders especially were of the massive type  expressly designed by nature for driving wide gaps in the opposing line  on the gridiron. He looked like one of nature's center-rushes, and had,  indeed, played in that position for Harvard during two strenuous  seasons. His face wore an expression of invincible good-humor. He had a  wide, good-natured mouth, and a pair of friendly gray eyes. One felt  that he liked his follow men and would be surprised and pained if they  did not like him.    As he passed along the street, he looked a little anxious. Sherlock  Holmes--and possibly even Doctor Watson--would have deduced that he had  something on his conscience.    At the entrance to a large office building, he paused, and seemed to  hesitate. Then, as if he had made up his mind to face an ordeal, he  went in and pressed the button of the elevator.    Leaving the elevator at the third floor, he went down the passage, and  pushed open a door on which was inscribed the legend, \"Westley, Martin  & Co.\"    A stout youth, walking across the office with his hands full of papers,  stopped in astonishment.    \"Hello, John Maude!\" he cried.    The young man grinned.    \"Say, where have you been? The old man's been as mad as a hornet since  he found you had quit without leave. He was asking for you just now.\"    \"I guess I'm up against it,\" admitted John cheerfully.    \"Where did you go yesterday?\"    John put the thing to him candidly, as man to man.    \"See here,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6971"],[0,"Judaism (#3)"],[1,"more than two centuries. While Christianity was  producing the Gospels and the rest of the New Testament--the work in large  part of Jews, or of men born in the circle of Judaism--Judaism in its  other manifestation was working at the Code known as the _Mishnah_.  This word means 'repetition,' or 'teaching by repetition'; it was an  oral tradition reduced to writing long after much of its contents had  been sifted in the discussions of the schools. In part earlier and in  part later than the _Mishnah_ was the _Midrash_ ('inquiry,'  'interpretation'), not a Code, but a two-fold exposition of Scripture;  homiletic with copious use of parable, and legalistic with an eye  to the regulation of conduct. Then came the _Talmud_ in two  recensions, the Palestinian and the Babylonian, the latter completed  about 500 A.D. For some centuries afterwards the Geonim (heads of the  Rabbinical Universities in Persia) continued to analyse and define  the legal prescriptions and ritual of Judaism, adding and changing in  accord with the needs of the day; for Tradition was a living, fluid  thing. Then in the eleventh century Isaac of Fez (Alfasi) formulated  a guide to Talmudic Law, and about a hundred years later (1180)  Maimonides produced his _Strong Hand_, a Code of law and custom  which influenced Jewish life ever after. Other codifications were made;  but finally, in the sixteenth century, Joseph Caro (mystic and legalist)  compiled the _Table Prepared_ (_Shulchan Aruch_), which, with  masterly skill, collected the whole of the traditional law, arranged  it under convenient heads in chapters and paragraphs, and carried down  to our own day the Rabbinic conception of life. Under this Code, with  more or less relaxation, the great bulk of Jews still live. But the  revolt against it, or emancipation from it, is progressing every year,  for the olden Jewish conception of religion and the old Jewish theory  of life are, as hinted above, becoming seriously undermined.    Now in what precedes there has been some intentional ambiguity in  the use of the word Law. Much of the misunderstanding of Judaism has  arisen from this ambiguity. 'Law' is in no adequate sense what the Jews  themselves understood by the nomism of their religion. In modern times  Law and Religion tend more and more to separate, and to speak of Judaism  as Law _eo ipso_ implies a divorce of Judaism from Religion. The  old antithesis between letter and spirit is but a phase of the same  criticism. Law must specify, and the lawyer interprets Acts of Parliament  by their letter; he refuses to be guided by the motives of the Act, he  is concerned with what the Act distinctly formulates in set terms. In  this sense Judaism never was a Legal Religion. It did most assiduously  seek to get to the underlying motives of the written laws, and all the  expansions of the Law were based on a desire more fully to realise the  meaning and intention of the written Code. In other words, the Law was  looked upon as the expression of the Will of God. Man was to yield to  that Will for two reasons. First, because God is the perfect ideal of  goodness. That ideal was for man to revere, and, so far as in him lay,  to imitate. 'As I am merciful, be thou merciful; because I am gracious,  be thou gracious.' The 'Imitation of God' is a notion which constantly  meets us in Rabbinic literature. It is based on the Scriptural text:  'Be ye holy, for I the Lord am holy.' 'God, the ideal of all morality,  is the founder of man's moral nature.' This is Professor Lazarus'  modern way of putting it. But in substance it is the Jewish conception  through all the ages. And there is a second reason. The Jew would not  have understood the possibility of any other expression of the Divine  Will than the expression which Judaism enshrined. For though he held that  the Law was something imposed from without, he identified this imposed  Law with the law which his own moral nature posited. The Rabbis tell us  that certain things in the written Law could have been reached by man  without the Law. The Law was in large part a correspondence to man's moral  nature. This Rabbinic idea Lazarus sums up in the epigram: 'Moral laws,  then, are not laws because they are written; they are written because  they are laws.' The moral principle is autonomous, but its archetype is  God. The ultimate reason, like the highest aim of morality, should be  in itself. The threat of punishment and the promise of reward are the  psychologic means to secure the fulfilment of laws, never the reasons for  the laws, nor the motives to action. It is easy and necessary sometimes  to praise and justify eudemonism, but, as Lazarus adds, 'Not a state to  be reached, not a good to be won, not an evil to be warded off, is the  impelling force of morality, but itself furnishes the creative impulse,  the supreme commanding authority' (_Ethics of Judaism_, I. chap,  ii.). And so the Rabbi of the third century B.C., Antigonos of Socho, put  it in the memorable saying: 'Be not like servants who minister to their  master upon the condition of receiving a reward; but be like servants  who minister to their master without the condition of receiving a reward;  and let the Fear of heaven be upon you' (Aboth, i. 3).    Clearly the multiplication of rules obscures principles. The object of  codification, to get at the full meaning of principles, is defeated by  its own success. For it is always easier to follow rules than to apply  principles. Virtues are more attainable than virtue, characteristics than  character. And while it is false to assert that Judaism attached more  importance to ritual than to religion, yet, the two being placed on one  and the same plane, it is possible to find in co-existence ritual piety  and moral baseness. Such a combination is ugly, and people do not stop  to think whether the baseness would be more or less if the ritual piety  were absent instead of present. But it is the fact that on the whole  the Jewish codification of religion did not produce the evil results  possible or even likely to accrue. The Jew was always distinguished for  his domestic virtues, his purity of life, his sobriety, his charity,  his devotion. These were the immediate consequence of his Law-abiding  disposition and theory. Perhaps there was some lack of enthusiasm,  something too much of the temperate. But the facts of life always  brought their corrective. Martyrdom was the means by which the Jewish  consciousness was kept at a glowing heat. And as the Jew was constantly  called upon to die for his religion, the religion ennobled the life  which was willingly surrendered for the religion. The Messianic Hope  was vitalised by persecution. The Jew, devotee of practical ideals,  became also a dreamer. His visions of God were ever present to remind  him that the law which he codified was to him the Law of God.        CHAPTER III    ARTICLES OF FAITH      It is often said that Judaism left belief free while it put conduct  into fetters. Neither half of this assertion is strictly true. Belief  was not free altogether; conduct was not altogether controlled. In the  _Mishnah_ (Sanhedrin, x. 1) certain classes of unbelievers are  pronounced portionless in the world to come. Among those excluded  from Paradise are men who deny the resurrection of the dead, and men  who refuse assent to the doctrine of the Divine origin of the Torah,  or Scripture. Thus it cannot be said that belief was, in the Rabbinic  system, perfectly free. Equally inaccurate is the assertion that conduct  was entirely a matter of prescription. Not only were men praised for  works of supererogation, performance of more than the Law required; not  only were there important divergences in the practical rules of conduct  formulated by the various Rabbis; but there was a whole class of actions  described as 'matters given over to the heart,' delicate refinements  of conduct which the law left untouched and were a concern exclusively  of the feeling, the private judgment of the individual. The right of  private judgment was passionately insisted on in matters of conduct, as  when Rabbi Joshua refused to be guided as to his practical decisions by  the Daughter of the Voice, the supernatural utterance from on high. The  Law, he contended, is on earth, not in heaven; and man must be his own  judge in applying the Law to his own life and time. And, the Talmud adds,  God Himself announced that Rabbi Joshua was right.    Thus there was neither complete fluidity of doctrine nor complete rigidity  of conduct. There was freedom of conduct within the law, and there was  law within freedom of doctrine.    But Dr. Emil Hirsch puts the case fairly when he says: 'In the  same sense as Christianity or Islam, Judaism cannot be credited with  Articles of Faith. Many attempts have indeed been made at systematising  and reducing to a fixed phraseology and sequence the contents of the  Jewish religion. But these have always lacked the one essential element:  authoritative sanction on the part of a supreme ecclesiastical body'  (_Jewish Encyclopedia_, ii. 148).    Since the epoch of the Great Sanhedrin, there has been no central  authority recognised throughout Jewry. The Jewish organisation has long  been congregational. Since the fourth century there has been no body  with any jurisdiction over the mass of Jews. At that date the Calendar  was fixed by astronomical calculations. The Patriarch, in Babylon,  thereby voluntarily abandoned the hold he had previously had over the  scattered Jews, for it was no longer the fiat of the Patriarch that  settled the dates of the Festivals. While there was something like a  central authority, the Canon of Scripture had been fixed by Synods, but  there is no record of any attempt to promulgate articles of faith. During  the revolt against Hadrian an Assembly of Rabbis was held at Lydda. It was  then decided that a Jew must yield his life rather than accept safety from  "]]]
