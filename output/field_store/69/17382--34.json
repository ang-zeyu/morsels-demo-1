[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5460"],[0,"An Egyptian Princess â€” Complete (#3)"],[1,"more on this subject, but will  permit myself only one remark in conclusion. Lovers delighted in nature  then as now; the moon was their chosen confidante, and I know of no  modern poem in which the mysterious charm of a summer night and the  magic beauty which lies on flowers, trees and fountains in those silent  hours when the world is asleep, is more exquisitely described than in  the following verses, also by Sappho, at the reading of which we seem  forced to breathe more slowly, \"kuhl bis an's Herz hinan.\"              \"Planets, that around the beauteous moon            Attendant wait, cast into shade            Their ineffectual lustres, soon            As she, in full-orb'd majesty array'd,            Her silver radiance pours            Upon this world of ours.\"    and:--              \"Thro' orchard plots with fragrance crown'd,            The clear cold fountain murm'ring flows;            And forest leaves, with rustling sound,            Invite to soft repose.\"    The foregoing remarks seemed to me due to those who consider a love such  as that of Sappho and Bartja to have been impossible among the ancients.  Unquestionably it was much rarer then than in these days: indeed I  confess to having sketched my pair of lovers in somewhat bright colors.  But may I not be allowed, at least once, to claim the poet's freedom?    How seldom I have availed myself of this freedom will be evident from  the notes included in each volume. They seemed to me necessary, partly  in order to explain the names and illustrate the circumstances mentioned  in the text, and partly to vindicate the writer in the eyes of the  learned. I trust they may not prove discouraging to any, as the text  will be found easily readable without reference to the explanations.       Jena, November 23, 1868.                 GEORG EBERS, DR.          PREFACE TO THE FOURTH GERMAN EDITION.    Two years and a half after the appearance of the third edition of \"An  Egyptian Princess,\" a fourth was needed. I returned long since from  the journey to the Nile, for which I was preparing while correcting the  proof-sheets of the third edition, and on which I can look back with  special satisfaction. During my residence in Egypt, in 1872-73, a  lucky accident enabled me to make many new discoveries; among them one  treasure of incomparable value, the great hieratic manuscript, which  bears my name. Its publication has just been completed, and it is now in  the library of the Leipzig University.    The Papyrus Ebers, the second in size and the best preserved of all the  ancient Egyptian manuscripts which have come into our possession,  was written in the 16th century B. C., and contains on 110 pages the  hermetic book upon the medicines of the ancient Egyptians, known also to  the Alexandrine Greeks. The god Thoth (Hermes) is called \"the guide\" of  physicians, and the various writings and treatises of which the work is  composed are revelations from him. In this venerable scroll diagnoses  are made and remedies suggested for the internal and external diseases  of most portions of the human body. With the drugs prescribed are  numbers, according to which they are weighed with weights and measured  with hollow measures, and accompanying the prescriptions are noted the  pious axioms to be repeated by the physician, while compounding and  giving them to the patient. On the second line of the first page of our  manuscript, it is stated that it came from Sais. A large portion of  this work is devoted to the visual organs. On the twentieth line of the  fifty-fifth page begins the book on the eyes, which fills eight large  pages. We were formerly compelled to draw from Greek and Roman authors  what we knew about the remedies used for diseases of the eye among the  ancient Egyptians. The portion of the Papyrus Ebers just mentioned  is now the only Egyptian source from whence we can obtain instruction  concerning this important branch of ancient medicine.    All this scarcely seems to have a place in the preface of a historical  romance, and yet it is worthy of mention here; for there is something  almost \"providential\" in the fact that it was reserved for the author  of \"An Egyptian Princess\" to bestow the gift of this manuscript upon the  scientific world. Among the characters in the novel the reader will meet  an oculist from Sais, who wrote a book upon the diseases of the visual  organs. The fate of this valuable work exactly agrees with the course  of the narrative. The papyrus scroll of the Sais oculist, which a short  time ago existed only in the imagination of the author and readers of  \"An Egyptian Princess,\" is now an established fact. When I succeeded in  bringing the manuscript home, I felt like the man who had dreamed of a  treasure, and when he went out to ride found it in his path.    A reply to Monsieur Jules Soury's criticism of \"An Egyptian Princess\" in  the Revue des deux Mondes, Vol. VII, January 1875, might appropriately  be introduced into this preface, but would scarcely be possible without  entering more deeply into the ever-disputed question, which will be  answered elsewhere, whether the historical romance is ever justifiable.  Yet I cannot refrain from informing Monsieur Soury here that \"An  Egyptian Princess\" detained me from no other work. I wrote it in my  sick-room, before entering upon my academic career, and while composing  it, found not only comfort and pleasure, but an opportunity to give dead  scientific material a living interest for myself and others.    Monsieur Soury says romance is the mortal enemy of history; but this  sentence may have no more justice than the one with which I think myself  justified in replying: Landscape painting is the mortal enemy of botany.  The historical romance must be enjoyed like any other work of art.  No one reads it to study history; but many, the author hopes, may be  aroused by his work to make investigations of their own, for which the  notes point out the way. Already several persons of excellent mental  powers have been attracted to earnest Egyptological researches by  \"An Egyptian Princess.\" In the presence of such experiences, although  Monsieur Soury's clever statements appear to contain much that is true,  I need not apply his remark that \"historical romances injure the cause  of science\" to the present volume.         Leipzig, April 19, 1875.                        GEORG EBERS.          PREFACE TO THE FIFTH GERMAN EDITION.    Again a new edition of \"An Egyptian Princess\" has been required, and  again I write a special preface because the printing has progressed so  rapidly as unfortunately to render it impossible for me to correct  some errors to which my attention was directed by the kindness of  the well-known botanist, Professor Paul Ascherson of Berlin, who has  travelled through Egypt and the Oases.    In Vol. I, page 7, I allow mimosas to grow among other plants in  Rhodopis' garden. I have found them in all the descriptions of the Nile  valley, and afterwards often enjoyed the delicious perfume of the golden  yellow flowers in the gardens of Alexandria and Cairo. I now learn that  this very mimosa (Acacia farnesiana) originates in tropical America, and  was undoubtedly unknown in ancient Egypt. The bananas, which I mentioned  in Vol. I, p. 64, among other Egyptian plants, were first introduced  into the Nile valley from India by the Arabs. The botanical errors  occurring in the last volume I was able to correct. Helm's admirable  work on \"Cultivated Plants and Domestic Animals\" had taught me to notice  such things. Theophrastus, a native of Asia Minor, gives the first  description of a citron, and this proves that he probably saw the  so-called paradise-apple, but not our citron, which I am therefore not  permitted to mention among the plants cultivated in ancient Lydia. Palms  and birches are both found in Asia Minor; but I permitted them to grow  side by side, thereby committing an offense against the geographical  possibility of vegetable existence. The birch, in this locality,  flourishes in the mountainous region, the palm, according to Griesbach  (Vegetation of the Earth, Vol. I, p. 319) only appears on the southern  coast of the peninsula. The latter errors, as I previously mentioned,  will be corrected in the new edition. I shall of course owe special  thanks to any one who may call my attention to similar mistakes.       Leipzig, March 5, 1877                      GEORG EBERS          PREFACE TO THE NINTH GERMAN EDITION.    I have nothing to add to the ninth edition of \"An Egyptian Princess\"  except that it has been thoroughly revised. My sincere thanks are due  to Dr. August Steitz of Frankfort on the Main, who has travelled through  Egypt and Asia Minor, for a series of admirable notes, which he kindly  placed at my disposal. He will find that they have not remained unused.       Leipzig, November 13, 1879.                      GEORG EBERS            AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS.    By Georg Ebers          BOOK 1.          CHAPTER I.    The Nile had overflowed its bed. The luxuriant corn-fields and blooming  gardens on its shores were lost beneath a boundless waste of waters; and  only the gigantic temples and palaces of its cities, (protected from the  force of the water by dikes), and the tops of the tall palm-trees and  acacias could be seen above its surface. The branches of the sycamores  and plane-trees drooped and floated on the waves, but the boughs of the  tall silver poplars strained upward, as if anxious to avoid the watery  world beneath. The full-moon had risen; her soft light fell on the  Libyan range of mountains vanishing on the western horizon, and in the  north the shimmer of the Mediterranean could faintly be discerned. Blue  and white lotus-flowers floated on the clear water, bats of all  kinds darted softly through the still air, heavy with the scent of  acacia-blossom and jasmine; the wild pigeons and other birds were at  roost in the tops of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/548"],[0,"Project Trinity, 1945-1946 (#3)"],[1,"to determine if it would  work and what its effects would be.  In addition, the scientists were  concerned about the possible effects if the conventional explosives in  a nuclear device, particularly the more complex implosion-type device,  failed to trigger the nuclear reaction when detonated over enemy  territory.  Not only would the psychological impact of the weapon be  lost, but the enemy might recover large amounts of fissionable  material.    In March 1944, planning began to test-fire a plutonium-fueled  implosion device.  At LASL, an organization designated the X-2 Group  was formed within the Explosives Division.  Its duties were \"to make  preparations for a field test in which blast, earth shock, neutron and  gamma radiation would be studied and complete photographic records  made of the explosion and any atmospheric phenomena connected with the  explosion\" (13).  Dr. Oppenheimer chose the name TRINITY for the  project in September 1944 (12).      1.2  THE PROJECT TRINITY SITE    The TRINITY site was chosen by Manhattan Project scientists after  thorough study of eight different sites.  The site selected was an  area measuring 29 by 39 kilometers* in the northwest corner of the  Alamogordo Bombing Range.  The Alamogordo Bombing Range was located in  a desert in south-central New Mexico called the Jornada del Muerto  (\"Journey of Death\").  Figure 1-1 shows the location of the bombing  range.  The site was chosen for its remote location and good weather  and because it was already owned by the Government.  MED obtained  permission to use the site from the Commanding General of the Second  Air Force (Army Air Forces) on 7 September 1944 (12).  Figure 1-2  shows the TRINITY site with its major installations.     * Throughout this report, surface distances are given in metric units.   The metric conversion factors include: 1 meter = 3.28 feet; 1 meter =   1.09 yards; and 1 kilometer = 0.62 miles.  Vertical distances are   given in feet; altitudes are measured from mean sea level, while   heights are measured from surface level, unless otherwise noted.    Ground zero for the TRINITY detonation was at UTM coordinates  630266.**  Three shelters, located approximately 9,150 meters (10,000  yards) north, west, and south of ground zero, were built for the  protection of test personnel and instruments.  The shelters had walls  of reinforced concrete and were buried under a few feet of earth.  The  south shelter was the Control Point for the test (12).  The Base Camp,  which was the headquarters for Project TRINITY, was located  approximately 16 kilometers southwest of ground zero.  The principal  buildings of the abandoned McDonald Ranch, where the active parts of  the TRINITY device were assembled, stood 3,660 meters southeast of  ground zero.  Seven guard posts, which were simply small tents or  parked trucks like the ones shown in figures 1-3 and 1-4, dotted the  test site (9).     ** Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates are used in this   report.  The first three digits refer to a point on an east- west   axis, and the second three digits refer to a point on a north-south   axis.  The point so designated is the southwest corner of an area 100   meters square.      1.3 THE PROJECT TRINITY ORGANIZATION    The organization that planned and conducted Project TRINITY grew out  of the X-2 Group.  LASL, though administered by the University of  California, was part of the Manhattan Project, supervised by the Army  Corps of Engineers Manhattan Engineer District.  The chief of MED was  Maj. Gen. Leslie Groves of the Army Corps of Engineers.  Major General  Groves reported to both the Chief of Engineers and the Army Chief of  Staff.  The Army Chief of Staff reported to the Secretary of War, a  Cabinet officer directly responsible to the President.  Figure 1-5  outlines the organization of Project TRINITY.    The director of the Project TRINITY organization was Dr. Kenneth  Bainbridge.  Dr. Bainbridge reported to Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, the  director of LASL.  A team of nine research consultants advised Dr.  Bainbridge on scientific and technical matters (3).    The Project TRINITY organization was divided into the following  groups (3):    o The TRINITY Assembly Group, responsible for assembling and arming  the nuclear device    o The TR-1 (Services) Group, responsible for construction, utilities,  procurement, transportation, and communications    o  The TR-2 Group, responsible for air-blast and earth-shock measurements    o The TR-3 (Physics) Group, responsible for experiments concerning  measurements of ionizing radiation    o The TR-4 Group, responsible for meteorology    o The TR-5 Group, responsible for spectrographic and photographic  measurements    o The TR-6 Group, responsible for the airblast-airborne condenser  gauges    o The TR-7 (Medical) Group, responsible for the radiological safety  and general health of the Project TRINITY participants.    Each of these groups was divided into several units.  Individuals were  also assigned special tasks outside their groups, such as  communications and tracking the TRINITY cloud with a searchlight (3).      1.4 MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PARTICIPANTS IN PROJECT TRINITY    From March 1944 until the beginning of 1946, several thousand people  participated in Project TRINITY.  These included not only the LASL  scientists, but also scientists, technicians, and workmen employed at  MED installations throughout the United States.  According to entrance  logs, film badge data, and other records, about 1,000 people either  worked at or visited the TRINITY site from 16 July 1945 through 1946  (1; 3; 8; 15; 16).    Although supervised by Major General Groves and the Army Corps of  Engineers, many Manhattan Project personnel were civilians.  Military  personnel were assigned principally to support services, such as  security and logistics, although soldiers with special skills worked  with the civilians (7; 12).  Most of the military personnel were part  of the Army Corps of Engineers, although Navy and other Army personnel  were also assigned to the project (4; 12).        CHAPTER 2    THE ACTIVITIES AT PROJECT TRINITY      The TRINITY nuclear device was detonated on a 100-foot tower (shown in  figure 2-1) at UTM coordinates 630266 on the Alamogordo Bombing Range,  New Mexico, at 0530 Mountain War Time, on 16 July 1945.  The  detonation had a yield of 19 kilotons and left an impression 2.9  meters deep and 335 meters wide.  The cloud resulting from the  detonation rose to an altitude of 35,000 feet (5).  The TRINITY  detonation is shown in figure 2-2.    At shot-time, the temperature was 21.8 degrees Celsius, and the  surface air pressure was 850 millibars.  Winds at shot-time were  nearly calm at the surface but attained a speed of 10 knots from the  southwest at 10,300 feet.  At 34,600 feet, the wind speed was 23 knots  from the southwest.  The winds blew the cloud to the northeast (5).      2.1  PRESHOT ACTIVITIES    Construction of test site facilities on the Alamogordo Bombing Range  began in December 1944.  The first contingent of personnel, 12  military policemen, arrived just before Christmas.  The number of  personnel at the test site gradually increased until the peak level of  about 325 was reached the week before the detonation (2; 12).    On 7 May 1945 at 0437 hours, 200 LASL scientists and technicians  exploded 100 tons of conventional high explosives at the test site.  The explosives were stacked on top of a 20-foot tower and contained  tubes of radioactive solution to simulate, at a low level of activity,  the radioactive products expected from a nuclear explosion.  The test  produced a bright sphere which spread out in an oval form.  A column  of smoke and debris rose as high as 15,000 feet before drifting  eastward.  The explosion left a shallow crater 1.5 meters deep and 9  meters wide.  Monitoring in the area revealed a level of radioactivity  low enough to allow workers to spend several hours in the area (3;  12).    The planned firing date for the TRINITY device was 4 July 1945.  On 14  June 1945, Dr. Oppenheimer changed the test date to no earlier than 13  July and no later than 23 July.  On 30 June, the earliest firing date  was moved to 16 July, even though better weather was forecast for 18  and 19 July.  Because the Allied conference in Potsdam, Germany, was  about to begin and the President needed the results of the test as  soon as possible, the TRINITY test organization adjusted its schedules  accordingly and set shot-time at 0400 hours on 16 July (3; 12; 14).    The final preparations for the detonation started at 2200 on 15 July.  To prevent unnecessary danger, all personnel not essential to the  firing activities were ordered to leave the test site.  During the  night of 15 July, these people left for viewing positions on Compania  Hill,* 32 kilometers northwest of ground zero.  They were joined by  several spectators from LASL (3; 12).     * \"Compania\" also appears as \"Compana,\" \"Campagne,\" or \"Compagna\" in   various sources.    Project personnel not required to check instruments within the ground  zero area stationed themselves in the three shelters or at other  assigned locations.  The military police at Guard Posts 1, 2, and 4  blocked off all roads leading into the test site, and the men at Guard  Post 8, the only access to the ground zero area from the Base Camp,  ensured that no unauthorized individuals entered the area (9; 12).    At 0100 hours on 16 July, military policemen from Guard Posts 3, 5, 6,  and 7 met to compare their logs of personnel authorized to be in the  ground zero area.  The guards then traveled along the access roads to  clear out all project personnel.  As individuals left for their  assigned shelters or stations, their departures from the test area  were recorded in the military police logs.  By 0200 the area sweep was  completed, and the military police went to their shelters and  stations.  A"]]]
