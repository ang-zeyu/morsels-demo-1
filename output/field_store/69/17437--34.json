Would  that it were in my power to force him to witness the humiliation  and degradation of the red woman.\"    \"You shall have your way with her before another day has passed,  Matai Shang,\" said Thurid, \"if you but say the word.\"    \"I have heard of the Temple of the Sun, Dator,\" replied Matai Shang,  \"but never have I heard that its prisoners could be released before  the allotted year of their incarceration had elapsed.  How, then,  may you accomplish the impossible?\"    \"Access may be had to any cell of the temple at any time,\" replied  Thurid.  \"Only Issus knew this; nor was it ever Issus' way to  divulge more of her secrets than were necessary.  By chance, after  her death, I came upon an ancient plan of the temple, and there I  found, plainly writ, the most minute directions for reaching the  cells at any time.    \"And more I learned--that many men had gone thither for Issus in the  past, always on errands of death and torture to the prisoners; but  those who thus learned the secret way were wont to die mysteriously  immediately they had returned and made their reports to cruel  Issus.\"    \"Let us proceed, then,\" said Matai Shang at last.  \"I must trust  you, yet at the same time you must trust me, for we are six to your  one.\"    \"I do not fear,\" replied Thurid, \"nor need you.  Our hatred of  the common enemy is sufficient bond to insure our loyalty to each  other, and after we have defiled the Princess of Helium there will  be still greater reason for the maintenance of our allegiance--unless  I greatly mistake the temper of her lord.\"    Matai Shang spoke to the paddlers.  The boat moved on up the  tributary.    It was with difficulty that I restrained myself from rushing upon  them and slaying the two vile plotters; but quickly I saw the mad  rashness of such an act, which would cut down the only man who could  lead the way to Dejah Thoris' prison before the long Martian year  had swung its interminable circle.    If he should lead Matai Shang to that hallowed spot, then, too,  should he lead John Carter, Prince of Helium.    With silent paddle I swung slowly into the wake of the larger craft.          UNDER THE MOUNTAINS      As we advanced up the river which winds beneath the Golden Cliffs  out of the bowels of the Mountains of Otz to mingle its dark waters  with the grim and mysterious Iss the faint glow which had appeared  before us grew gradually into an all-enveloping radiance.    The river widened until it presented the aspect of a large lake  whose vaulted dome, lighted by glowing phosphorescent rock, was  splashed with the vivid rays of the diamond, the sapphire, the ruby,  and the countless, nameless jewels of Barsoom which lay incrusted  in the virgin gold which forms the major portion of these magnificent  cliffs.    Beyond the lighted chamber of the lake was darkness--what lay behind  the darkness I could not even guess.    To have followed the thern boat across the gleaming water would  have been to invite instant detection, and so, though I was loath  to permit Thurid to pass even for an instant beyond my sight, I  was forced to wait in the shadows until the other boat had passed  from my sight at the far extremity of the lake.    Then I paddled out upon the brilliant surface in the direction they  had taken.    When, after what seemed an eternity, I reached the shadows at the  upper end of the lake I found that the river issued from a low  aperture, to pass beneath which it was necessary that I compel  Woola to lie flat in the boat, and I, myself, must need bend double  before the low roof cleared my head.    Immediately the roof rose again upon the other side, but no longer was  the way brilliantly lighted.  Instead only a feeble glow emanated  from small and scattered patches of phosphorescent rock in wall  and roof.    Directly before me the river ran into this smaller chamber through  three separate arched openings.    Thurid and the therns were nowhere to be seen--into which of the  dark holes had they disappeared?  There was no means by which I  might know, and so I chose the center opening as being as likely  to lead me in the right direction as another.    Here the way was through utter darkness.  The stream was narrow--so  narrow that in the blackness I was constantly bumping first one  rock wall and then another as the river wound hither and thither  along its flinty bed.    Far ahead I presently heard a deep and sullen roar which increased  in volume as I advanced, and then broke upon my ears with all the  intensity of its mad fury as I swung round a sharp curve into a  dimly lighted stretch of water.    Directly before me the river thundered down from above in a mighty  waterfall that filled the narrow gorge from side to side, rising  far above me several hundred feet--as magnificent a spectacle as  I ever had seen.    But the roar--the awful, deafening roar of those tumbling waters  penned in the rocky, subterranean vault!  Had the fall not entirely  blocked my further passage and shown me that I had followed the  wrong course I believe that I should have fled anyway before the  maddening tumult.    Thurid and the therns could not have come this way.  By stumbling  upon the wrong course I had lost the trail, and they had gained so  much ahead of me that now I might not be able to find them before  it was too late, if, in fact, I could find them at all.    It had taken several hours to force my way up to the falls against  the strong current, and other hours would be required for the  descent, although the pace would be much swifter.    With a sigh I turned the prow of my craft down stream, and with  mighty strokes hastened with reckless speed through the dark and  tortuous channel until once again I came to the chamber into which  flowed the three branches of the river.    Two unexplored channels still remained from which to choose; nor  was there any means by which I could judge which was the more likely  to lead me to the plotters.    Never in my life, that I can recall, have I suffered such an agony  of indecision.  So much depended upon a correct choice; so much  depended upon haste.    The hours that I had already lost might seal the fate of the  incomparable Dejah Thoris were she not already dead--to sacrifice  other hours, and maybe days in a fruitless exploration of another  blind lead would unquestionably prove fatal.    Several times I essayed the right-hand entrance only to turn back  as though warned by some strange intuitive sense that this was not  the way.  At last, convinced by the oft-recurring phenomenon, I  cast my all upon the left-hand archway; yet it was with a lingering  doubt that I turned a parting look at the sullen waters which  rolled, dark and forbidding, from beneath the grim, low archway on  the right.    And as I looked there came bobbing out upon the current from the  Stygian darkness of the interior the shell of one of the great,  succulent fruits of the sorapus tree.    I could scarce restrain a shout of elation as this silent, insensate  messenger floated past me, on toward the Iss and Korus, for it told  me that journeying Martians were above me on that very stream.    They had eaten of this marvelous fruit which nature concentrates  within the hard shell of the sorapus nut, and having eaten had  cast the husk overboard.  It could have come from no others than  the party I sought.    Quickly I abandoned all thought of the left-hand passage, and a  moment later had turned into the right.  The stream soon widened,  and recurring areas of phosphorescent rock lighted my way.    I made good time, but was convinced that I was nearly a day behind  those I was tracking.  Neither Woola nor I had eaten since the  previous day, but in so far as he was concerned it mattered but  little, since practically all the animals of the dead sea bottoms  of Mars are able to go for incredible periods without nourishment.    Nor did I suffer.  The water of the river was sweet and cold, for  it was unpolluted by decaying bodies--like the Iss--and as for  food, why the mere thought that I was nearing my beloved princess  raised me above every material want.    As I proceeded, the river became narrower and the current swift  and turbulent--so swift in fact that it was with difficulty that  I forced my craft upward at all.  I could not have been making to  exceed a hundred yards an hour when, at a bend, I was confronted  by a series of rapids through which the river foamed and boiled at  a terrific rate.    My heart sank within me.  The sorapus nutshell had proved a false  prophet, and, after all, my intuition had been correct--it was the  left-hand channel that I should have followed.    Had I been a woman I should have wept.  At my right was a great,  slow-moving eddy that circled far beneath the cliff's overhanging  side, and to rest my tired muscles before turning back I let my  boat drift into its embrace.    I was almost prostrated by disappointment.  It would mean another  half-day's loss of time to retrace my way and take the only passage  that yet remained unexplored.  What hellish fate had led me to  select from three possible avenues the two that were wrong?    As the lazy current of the eddy carried me slowly about the periphery  of the watery circle my boat twice touched the rocky side of the  river in the dark recess beneath the cliff.  A third time it struck,  gently as it had before, but the contact resulted in a different  sound--the sound of wood scraping upon wood.    In an instant I was on the alert, for there could be no wood  within that buried river that had not been man brought.  Almost  coincidentally with my first apprehension of the noise, my hand shot  out across the boat's side, and a second later I felt my fingers  gripping the gunwale of another craft.

Alas! alas! my lord is dead.      O LITTLE BRIDE, WHY DOST THOU WEEP    WITH ALL THE HAPPY WORLD ASLEEP?      Alas! alas! my lord is dead!    Ah, who will stay these hungry tears,    Or still the want of famished years,    And crown with love my marriage-bed?    My soul burns with the quenchless fire    That lit my lover's funeral pyre:    Alas! alas! my lord is dead.        VILLAGE-SONG      Honey, child, honey, child, whither are you going?    Would you cast your jewels all to the breezes blowing?    Would you leave the mother who on golden grain has fed you?    Would you grieve the lover who is riding forth to wed you?      Mother mine, to the wild forest I am going,    Where upon the champa boughs the champa buds are blowing;    To the koil-haunted river-isles where lotus lilies glisten,    The voices of the fairy folk are calling me: O listen!      Honey, child, honey, child, the world is full of pleasure,    Of bridal-songs and cradle-songs and sandal-scented leisure.    Your bridal robes are in the loom, silver and saffron glowing,    Your bridal cakes are on the hearth: O whither are you going?      The bridal-songs and cradle-songs have cadences of sorrow,    The laughter of the sun to-day, the wind of death to-morrow.    Far sweeter sound the forest-notes where forest-streams are falling;    O mother mine, I cannot stay, the fairy-folk are calling.

INDIAN LOVE-SONG          She      Like a serpent to the calling voice of flutes,    Glides my heart into thy fingers, O my Love!    Where the night-wind, like a lover, leans above    His jasmine-gardens and sirisha-bowers;    And on ripe boughs of many-coloured fruits    Bright parrots cluster like vermilion flowers.             He      Like the perfume in the petals of a rose,    Hides thy heart within my bosom, O my love!    Like a garland, like a jewel, like a dove    That hangs its nest in the asoka-tree.    Lie still, O love, until the morning sows    Her tents of gold on fields of ivory.        CRADLE-SONG         From groves of spice,       O'er fields of rice,    Athwart the lotus-stream,       I bring for you,       Aglint with dew    A little lovely dream.         Sweet, shut your eyes,       The wild fire-flies    Dance through the fairy neem;       From the poppy-bole       For you I stole    A little lovely dream.         Dear eyes, good-night,       In golden light    The stars around you gleam;       On you I press       With soft caress    A little lovely dream.        SUTTEE      Lamp of my life, the lips of Death    Hath blown thee out with their sudden breath;    Naught shall revive thy vanished spark . . .    Love, must I dwell in the living dark?      Tree of my life, Death's cruel foot    Hath crushed thee down to thy hidden root;    Nought shall restore thy glory fled . . .    Shall the blossom live when the tree is dead?      Life of my life, Death's bitter sword    Hath severed us like a broken word,    Rent us in twain who are but one . .    Shall the flesh survive when the soul is gone?        SONGS FOR MUSIC      SONG OF A DREAM      Once in the dream of a night I stood    Lone in the light of a magical wood,    Soul-deep in visions that poppy-like sprang;    And spirits of Truth were the birds that sang,    And spirits of Love were the stars that glowed,    And spirits of Peace were the streams that flowed    In that magical wood in the land of sleep.      Lone in the light of that magical grove,    I felt the stars of the spirits of Love    Gather and gleam round my delicate youth,    And I heard the song of the spirits of Truth;    To quench my longing I bent me low    By the streams of the spirits of Peace that flow    In that magical wood in the land of sleep.        HUMAYUN TO ZOBEIDA      (From the Urdu)      You flaunt your beauty in the rose, your glory in the dawn,    Your sweetness in the nightingale, your whiteness in the swan.      You haunt my waking like a dream, my slumber like a moon,    Pervade me like a musky scent, possess me like a tune.      Yet, when I crave of you, my sweet, one tender moment's grace,    You cry, \"I SIT BEHIND THE VEIL, I CANNOT SHOW MY FACE.\"      Shall any foolish veil divide my longing from my bliss?    Shall any fragile curtain hide your beauty from my kiss?      What war is this of THEE and ME? Give o'er the wanton strife,    You are the heart within my heart, the life within my life.        AUTUMN SONG      Like a joy on the heart of a sorrow,       The sunset hangs on a cloud;    A golden storm of glittering sheaves,    Of fair and frail and fluttering leaves,       The wild wind blows in a cloud.      Hark to a voice that is calling       To my heart in the voice of the wind:    My heart is weary and sad and alone,    For its dreams like the fluttering leaves have gone,       And why should I stay behind?        ALABASTER      Like this alabaster box whose art    Is frail as a cassia-flower, is my heart,    Carven with delicate dreams and wrought    With many a subtle and exquisite thought.      Therein I treasure the spice and scent    Of rich and passionate memories blent    Like odours of cinnamon, sandal and clove,    Of song and sorrow and life and love.        ECSTASY      Cover mine eyes, O my Love!       Mine eyes that are weary of bliss    As of light that is poignant and strong       O silence my lips with a kiss,    My lips that are weary of song!      Shelter my soul, O my love!       My soul is bent low with the pain    And the burden of love, like the grace       Of a flower that is smitten with rain:    O shelter my soul from thy face!        TO MY FAIRY FANCIES      Nay, no longer I may hold you,       In my spirit's soft caresses,    Nor like lotus-leaves enfold you       In the tangles of my tresses.    Fairy fancies, fly away       To the white cloud-wildernesses,             Fly away!      Nay, no longer ye may linger       With your laughter-lighted faces,    Now I am a thought-worn singer       In life's high and lonely places.    Fairy fancies, fly away,       To bright wind-inwoven spaces,             Fly away!        POEMS      ODE TO H.H.

Sweet, sumptuous fables of Baghdad    The splendours of your court recall,    The torches of a Thousand Nights    Blaze through a single festival;    And Saki-singers down the streets,    Pour for us, in a stream divine,    From goblets of your love-ghazals    The rapture of your Sufi wine.      Prince, where your radiant cities smile,    Grim hills their sombre vigils keep,    Your ancient forests hoard and hold    The legends of their centuried sleep;    Your birds of peace white-pinioned float    O'er ruined fort and storied plain,    Your faithful stewards sleepless guard    The harvests of your gold and grain.      God give you joy, God give you grace    To shield the truth and smite the wrong,    To honour Virtue, Valour, Worth.    To"]]]
