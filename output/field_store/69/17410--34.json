But  don't go off at half-cock, narvous like. I am not like the black  preacher that had forty-eleven divisions. I have only a few more  remarks to make. Well, I have observed that in editin' my last  Journal, you struck out some scores I made under certain passages and  maxims, because you thought they were not needed, or looked vain. I  know it looks consaited as well as you do, but I know their use also.  I have my own views of things. Let them also be as I have made them.  They warn't put there for nothin'. I have a case in pint that runs on  all fours with it, as brother Josiah the lawyer used to say, and if  there was anythin' wantin' to prove that lawyers were not strait up  and down in their dealings, that expression would show it.    \"I was to court wunst to Slickville, when he was addressin' of the  jury. The main points of his argument he went over and over again,  till I got so tired I took up my hat and walked out. Sais I to him,  arter court was prorogued and members gone home,    \"'Sy,' sais I, 'why on airth did you repeat them arguments so often?  It was everlastin' yarny.'    \"'Sam,' sais he, and he gave his head a jupe, and pressed his lips  close, like a lemon-squeezer, the way lawyers always do when they want  to look wise, 'when I can't drive a nail with one blow, I hammer away  till I do git it in. Some folks' heads is as hard as hackmetacks--you  have to bore a hole in it first to put the nail in, to keep it from  bendin', and then it is as touch as a bargain if you can send it home  and clinch it.'    \"Now maxims and saws are the sumtotalisation of a thing. Folks won't  always add up the columns to see if they are footed right, but show  'em the amount and result, and that they are able to remember and  carry away with them. No--no, put them Italics in, as I have always  done. They show there is truth at the bottom. I like it, for it's what  I call sense on the short-cards--do you take? Recollect always, you  are not Sam Slick, and I am not you. The greatest compliment a  Britisher would think he could pay you, would be to say, 'I should  have taken you for an Englishman.' Now the greatest compliment he can  pay me is to take me for a Connecticut Clockmaker, who hoed his way up  to the Embassy to London, and preserved so much of his nationality,  after being so long among foreigners. Let the Italics be--you ain't  answerable for them, nor my boastin' neither. When you write a book of  your own, leave out both if you like, but as you only edit my Journal,  if you leave them out, just go one step further, and leave out Sam  Slick also.    \"There is another thing, Squire, upon which I must make a remark, if  you will bear with me. In my last work you made me speak purer English  than you found in my Journal, and altered my phraseology, or rather my  dialect. Now, my dear Nippent--\"    \"Nippent!\" said I, \"what is that?\"    \"The most endearing word in the Indian language for friend,\" he said,  \"only it's more comprehensive, including ally, foster-brother,  life-preserver, shaft-horse, and everything that has a human tie in  it.\"    \"Ah, Slick,\" I said, \"how skilled you are in soft sawder! You laid  that trap for me on purpose, so that I might ask the question, to  enable you to throw the lavender to me.\"    \"Dod drot that word soft sawder,\" said he, \"I wish I had never  invented it. I can't say a civil thing to anybody now, but he looks  arch, as if he had found a mare's nest, and says, 'Ah, Slick! none of  your soft sawder now.' But, my dear nippent, by that means you destroy  my individuality. I cease to be the genuine itinerant Yankee  Clockmaker, and merge into a very bad imitation. You know I am a  natural character, and always was, and act and talk naturally, and as  far as I can judge, the little alteration my sojourn in London with  the American embassy has made in my pronunciation and provincialism,  is by no means an improvement to my Journal. The moment you take away  my native dialect, I become the representative of another class, and  cease to be your old friend 'Sam Slick, the Clockmaker.' Bear with me  this once, Squire, and don't tear your shirt, I beseech you, for in  all probability it will be the last time it will be in your power to  subject me to the ordeal of criticism, and I should like, I confess,  to remain true to myself and to Nature to the last.    \"On the other hand, Squire, you will find passages in this Journal  that have neither Yankee words nor Yankee brag in them. Now pray don't  go as you did in the last, and alter them by insarten here and there  what you call 'Americanisms,' so as to make it more in character and  uniform; that is going to t'other extreme, for I can write as pure  English, if I can't speak it, as anybody can.1 My education warn't a  college one, like my brothers, Eldad's and Josiah's, the doctor and  lawyer; but it was not neglected for all that. Dear old Minister was a  scholar, every inch of him, and took great pains with me in my themes,  letters, and composition. 'Sam,' he used to say, 'there are four  things needed to write well: first, master the language grammatically;  second, master your subject; third, write naturally; fourth, let your  heart as well as your hand guide the pen.' It ain't out of keeping  therefore for me to express myself decently in composition if I  choose. It warn't out of character, with Franklin, and he was a poor  printer boy, nor Washington, and he was only a land-surveyor, and they  growed to be 'some punkins' too.      1 The reader will perceive from a perusal of this Journal, that Mr  Slick, who is always so ready to detect absurdity in others, has in  this instance exhibited a species of vanity by no means uncommon in  this world. He prides himself more on composition, to which he has but  small pretensions, than on those things for which the public is  willing enough to give him full credit. Had he however received a  classical education, it may well be doubted whether he would have been  as useful or successful a man as President of Yale College, as he has  been as an itinerant practical Clockmaker.      \"An American clockmaker ain't like a European one. He may not be as  good a workman as t'other one, but he can do somethin' else besides  makin' wheels and pulleys. One always looks forward to rise in the  world, the other to attain excellence in his line. I am, as I have  expressed it in some part of this Journal, not ashamed of having been  a tradesman--I glory in it; but I should indeed have been ashamed if,  with the instruction I received from dear old Minister, I had always  remained one. No, don't alter my Journal. I am just what I am, and  nothing more or less. You can't measure me by English standards; you  must take an American one, and that will give you my length, breadth,  height, and weight to a hair. If silly people take you for me, and put  my braggin' on your shoulders, why jist say, 'You might be mistakened  for a worse fellow than he is, that's all.' Yes, yes, let my talk  remain 'down-east talk,'1 and my writin' remain clear of cant terms  when you find it so.      1 It must not be inferred from this expression that Mr Slick's talk is  all \"pure down-east dialect.\" The intermixture of Americans is now so  great, in consequence of their steamers and railroads, that there is  but little pure provincialism left. They have borrowed from each other  in different sections most liberally, and not only has the vocabulary  of the south and west contributed its phraseology to New England, but  there is recently an affectation in consequence of the Mexican war, to  naturalise Spanish words, some of which Mr Slick, who delights in this  sort of thing, has introduced into this Journal.--ED.      \"I like Yankee words--I learned them when young. Father and mother  used them, and so did all the old folks to Slickville. There is both  fun, sense, and expression in 'em too, and that is more than there is  in Taffy's, Pat's, or Sawney's brogue either. The one enriches and  enlarges the vocabulary, the other is nothing but broken English, and  so confoundedly broken too, you can't put the pieces together  sometimes. Again, my writing, when I freeze down solid to it, is just  as much in character as the other. Recollect this--Every woman in our  country who has a son knows that he may, and thinks that he will,  become President of the United States, and that thought and that  chance make that boy superior to any of his class in Europe.    \"And now, Squire,\" said he, \"I believe there has been enough said  about myself and my Journal. Sposen we drink success to the 'human  nature,' or 'men and things,' or whatever other name you select for  this Journal, and then we will talk of something else.\"    \"I will drink that toast,\" I said, \"with all my heart, and now let me  ask you how you have succeeded in your mission about the fisheries?\"    \"First rate,\" he replied; \"we have them now, and no mistake!\"    \"By the treaty?\" I inquired.    \"No,\" he said, \"I have discovered the dodge, and we shall avail of it  at once. By a recent local law foreigners can hold real estate in this  province now. And by a recent Act of Parliament our vessels can obtain  British registers. Between these two privileges, a man don't deserve  to be called an American who can't carry on the fisheries in spite of  all the cruisers, revenue officers, and prohibitary laws under the  sun. It is a peaceable and quiet way of getting possession, and far  better than fighting for them, while it comports more with the dignity  of our great and enlightened nation.\"    \"What do you think,\" I said, \"of the Elgin treaty as a bargain?\"    After some hesitation, he looked up and smiled.    \"We can't complain,\" said he. \"As usual we have got hold of the right  eend of the rope, and got a vast deal more than we expected. The truth  is, the English are so fond of trade, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6124"],[0,"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (#3)"],[1,"to be made to this: So,  like a fool, I was ready to cry; and went away courtesying and blushing,  I am sure, up to the ears; for, though there was no harm in what he  said, yet I did not know how to take it. But I went and told all to Mrs.  Jervis, who said, God put it into his heart to be good to me; and I must  double my diligence. It looked to her, she said, as if he would fit me  in dress for a waiting-maid's place on Lady Davers's own person.    But still your kind fatherly cautions came into my head, and made all  these gifts nothing near to me what they would have been. But yet, I  hope, there is no reason; for what good could it do to him to harm such  a simple maiden as me? Besides, to be sure no lady would look upon  him, if he should so disgrace himself. So I will make myself easy; and,  indeed, I should never have been otherwise, if you had not put it into  my head; for my good, I know very well. But, may be, without these  uneasinesses to mingle with these benefits, I might be too much puffed  up: So I will conclude, all that happens is for our good; and God bless  you, my dear father and mother; and I know you constantly pray for a  blessing upon me; who am, and shall always be,                                        Your dutiful DAUGHTER.          LETTER VIII      DEAR PAMELA,    I cannot but renew my cautions on your master's kindness, and his free  expression to you about the stockings. Yet there may not be, and I hope  there is not, any thing in it. But when I reflect, that there possibly  may, and that if there should, no less depends upon it than my child's  everlasting happiness in this world and the next; it is enough to make  one fearful for you. Arm yourself, my dear child, for the worst; and  resolve to lose your life sooner than your virtue. What though the  doubts I filled you with, lessen the pleasure you would have had in your  master's kindness; yet what signify the delights that arise from a few  paltry fine clothes, in comparison with a good conscience?    These are, indeed, very great favours that he heaps upon you, but so  much the more to be suspected; and when you say he looked so amiably,  and like an angel, how afraid I am, that they should make too great an  impression upon you! For, though you are blessed with sense and prudence  above your years, yet I tremble to think, what a sad hazard a poor  maiden of little more than fifteen years of age stands against the  temptations of this world, and a designing young gentleman, if he should  prove so, who has so much power to oblige, and has a kind of authority  to command, as your master.    I charge you, my dear child, on both our blessings, poor as we are, to  be on your guard; there can be no harm in that. And since Mrs. Jervis is  so good a gentlewoman, and so kind to you, I am the easier a great deal,  and so is your mother; and we hope you will hide nothing from her, and  take her counsel in every thing. So, with our blessings, and assured  prayers for you, more than for ourselves, we remain,    Your loving FATHER AND MOTHER.    Be sure don't let people's telling you, you are pretty, puff you up; for  you did not make yourself, and so can have no praise due to you for  it. It is virtue and goodness only, that make the true beauty. Remember  that, Pamela.          LETTER IX      DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,    I am sorry to write you word, that the hopes I had of going to wait on  Lady Davers, are quite over. My lady would have had me; but my master,  as I heard by the by, would not consent to it. He said her nephew might  be taken with me, and I might draw him in, or be drawn in by him; and he  thought, as his mother loved me, and committed me to his care, he ought  to continue me with him; and Mrs. Jervis would be a mother to me. Mrs.  Jervis tells me the lady shook her head, and said, Ah! brother! and that  was all. And as you have made me fearful by your cautions, my heart  at times misgives me. But I say nothing yet of your caution, or my own  uneasiness, to Mrs. Jervis; not that I mistrust her, but for fear she  should think me presumptuous, and vain and conceited, to have any fears  about the matter, from the great distance between such a gentleman, and  so poor a girl. But yet Mrs. Jervis seemed to build something upon Lady  Davers's shaking her head, and saying, Ah! brother! and no more. God, I  hope, will give me his grace: and so I will not, if I can help it, make  myself too uneasy; for I hope there is no occasion. But every little  matter that happens, I will acquaint you with, that you may continue to  me your good advice, and pray for                                   Your sad-hearted PAMELA.          LETTER X      DEAR MOTHER,    You and my good father may wonder you have not had a letter from me in  so many weeks; but a sad, sad scene, has been the occasion of it. For to  be sure, now it is too plain, that all your cautions were well grounded.  O my dear mother! I am miserable, truly miserable!--But yet, don't be  frightened, I am honest!--God, of his goodness, keep me so!    O this angel of a master! this fine gentleman! this gracious benefactor  to your poor Pamela! who was to take care of me at the prayer of his  good dying mother; who was so apprehensive for me, lest I should be  drawn in by Lord Davers's nephew, that he would not let me go to Lady  Davers's: This very gentleman (yes, I must call him gentleman, though he  has fallen from the merit of that title) has degraded himself to offer  freedoms to his poor servant! He has now shewed himself in his true  colours; and, to me, nothing appear so black, and so frightful.    I have not been idle; but had writ from time to time, how he, by sly  mean degrees, exposed his wicked views; but somebody stole my letter,  and I know not what has become of it. It was a very long one. I fear, he  that was mean enough to do bad things, in one respect, did not stick at  this. But be it as it will, all the use he can make of it will be, that  he may be ashamed of his part; I not of mine: for he will see I was  resolved to be virtuous, and gloried in the honesty of my poor parents.    I will tell you all, the next opportunity; for I am watched very  narrowly; and he says to Mrs. Jervis, This girl is always scribbling;  I think she may be better employed. And yet I work all hours with  my needle, upon his linen, and the fine linen of the family; and am,  besides, about flowering him a waistcoat.--But, oh! my heart's broke  almost; for what am I likely to have for my reward, but shame and  disgrace, or else ill words, and hard treatment! I'll tell you all soon,  and hope I shall find my long letter.                                           Your most afflicted DAUGHTER.    May-be, I he and him too much: but it is his own fault if I do. For why  did he lose all his dignity with me?          LETTER XI      DEAR MOTHER,    Well, I can't find my letter, and so I'll try to recollect it all, and  be as brief as I can. All went well enough in the main for some time  after my letter but one. At last, I saw some reason to suspect; for he  would look upon me, whenever he saw me, in such a manner, as shewed not  well; and one day he came to me, as I was in the summer-house in the  little garden, at work with my needle, and Mrs. Jervis was just gone  from me; and I would have gone out, but he said, No don't go, Pamela;  I have something to say to you; and you always fly me when I come near  you, as if you were afraid of me.    I was much out of countenance, you may well think; but said, at last, It  does not become your good servant to stay in your presence, sir, without  your business required it; and I hope I shall always know my place.    Well, says he, my business does require it sometimes; and I have a mind  you should stay to hear what I have to say to you.    I stood still confounded, and began to tremble, and the more when he  took me by the hand; for now no soul was near us.    My sister Davers, said he, (and seemed, I thought, to be as much at a  loss for words as I,) would have had you live with her; but she would  not do for you what I am resolved to do, if you continue faithful and  obliging. What say'st thou, my girl? said he, with some eagerness;  had'st thou not rather stay with me, than go to my sister Davers? He  looked so, as filled me with affrightment; I don't know how; wildly, I  thought.    I said, when I could speak, Your honour will forgive me; but as you have  no lady for me to wait upon, and my good lady has been now dead this  twelvemonth, I had rather, if it would not displease you, wait upon Lady  Davers, because--    I was proceeding, and he said, a little hastily--Because you are a  little fool, and know not what's good for yourself. I tell you I will  make a gentlewoman of you, if you be obliging, and don't stand in your  own light; and so saying, he put his arm about me, and kissed me!    Now, you will say, all his wickedness appeared plainly. I struggled and  trembled, and was so benumbed with terror, that I sunk down, not in a  fit, and yet not myself; and I found myself in his arms, quite void  of strength; and he kissed me two or three times, with frightful  eagerness.--At last I burst from him, and was getting out of the  summer-house; but he held me back, and shut the door.    I would have given my life for a farthing. And he said, I'll do you no  harm, Pamela; don't be afraid of me. I said, I won't stay. You won't,  hussy! said he: Do you know whom you speak to? I lost all fear, and all  respect, and said, Yes, I do, sir, too well!--Well may I forget that I  am your servant, when you forget what belongs to a master.    I sobbed and cried most sadly. What a foolish hussy you are! said he:  Have I done you any harm? Yes, sir, said I, the greatest harm in the  world: You have taught me to forget myself and what belongs to me,  and have lessened the distance that fortune has made between us, by  demeaning yourself, to be so free to a"]]]
