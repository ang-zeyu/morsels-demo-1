The clearing of a sufficient space for the accommodation of the hut was  no light task for unaccustomed hands, for the bloodwood trees were mighty  and tough, and the dubious work of burning up the trunks and branches  while yet green, in our eagerness for free air and tidiness, was  undertaken. It was also accomplished.    For several weeks there was little done save to build a kitchen and shed  and widen the clearing in the forest. Inspection of the details of our  domain was reserved as a sort of reward for present task and toil.  According to the formula neatly printed in official journals, the  building of a slab hut is absurdly easy--quite a pastime for the settler  eager to get a roof of bark or thatch over his head. The frame, of  course, goes up without assistance, and then the principal item is the  slabs for walls. When you have fallen your tree and sawn off a block of  the required length, you have only to split off the slab. Ah! but suppose  the timber does not split freely, and your heavy maul does; and the  wedges instead of entering have the habit of bouncing out as if they were  fitted with internal springs, and your maul wants renewal several times,  until you find that the timber prescribed is of no account for such  tools; and at best your slabs run off to nothing at half length, and  several trees have to be cut down before you get a single decent slab,  and everybody is peevish with weariness and disappointment, the rudest  house in the bush will be a long time in the building. \"Experience is a  hard mistress, yet she teacheth as none other.\" We came to be more  indebted to the hard mistress--she gave us blistering palms and aching  muscles--than to all the directions and prescriptions of men who claim to  have climbed to the top of the tree in the profession of the \"bush.\" A  \"bush\" carpenter is a very admirable person, when he is not also a bush  lawyer. Mere amateurs would be wise if they held their enthusiasm in  check when they read the recipe--pat as the recipe for the making of a  rice-pudding--for the construction of even a bark hut. It is so very easy  to write it all down; but if you have had no actual experience in  bark-cutting, and your trees are not in the right condition, you will put  your elation to a shockingly severe test, harden the epidermis of your  hands, and the whole of your heart, and go to bed many nights sadly ere  you get one decent sheet for your roof.    We do not all belong to the ancient and honourable family of the Swiss  Robinsons, who performed a series of unassuming miracles on their island.  There was no practical dispensation of providential favours on our  behalf. Trees that had the reputation of providing splendid splitting  timber defiantly slandered themselves, and others that should have almost  flayed themselves at the first tap of the tomahawk had not the slightest  regard for the reputation vouched for in serious publications.    But why \"burden our remembrance with a heaviness that's gone?\" Why recall  the memory of those acheful days, when all the pleasant and restful  features of the island are uncatalogued? Before the rains began we had  comfortable if circumscribed shelter. Does not that suffice? Our dwelling  consisted of one room and a kitchen. Perforce the greater part of our  time was spent out of doors. Isolation kept us moderately free from  visitors. Those who did violate our seclusion had to put up with the  consequences. We had purchased liberty. Large liberties are the  birthright of the English. We had acquired most of the small liberties,  and the ransom paid was the abandonment of many things hitherto deemed to  form an integral part of existence.    Had we not cast aside all traditions, revolting from the uniformity of  life, from the rules of the bush as well as from the conventionalities of  society? Here we were to indulge our caprices, work out our own  salvation, live in accordance with our own primitive notions, and, if  possible, find pleasure in haunts which it is not popularly supposed to  frequent.    Others may point to higher ideals and tell of exciting experiences, of  success achieved, and glory and honour won. Ours not to envy superior  qualifications and victories which call for strife and struggle, but to  submit ourselves joyfully to the charms of the \"simple life.\"    OUR ISLAND        \"Awake, O North Wind, and come, thou South,      Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.\"    Our Island! What was it when we came into possession? From the sea,  merely a range displaying the varied leafage of jungle and forest. A  steep headland springing from a ledge of rock on the north, and a broad,  embayed-based flat converging into an obtruding sand-spit to the west,  enclose a bay scarcely half a mile from one horn to the other, the sheet  of water almost a perfect crescent, with the rocky islet of Purtaboi,  plumed with trees, to indicate the circumference of a circle. Trees come  to the water's edge from the abutment of the bold eminence. Dome-shaped  shrubs of glossy green (native cabbage--SCAEVOLA KOENIGII), with groups  of pandanus palms bearing massive orange-coloured fruits; and here and  there graceful umbrella trees, with deep-red decorations, hibiscus bushes  hung with yellow funnells, and a thin line of ever-sighing beech oaks  (CASUARINA) fringe the clean untrodden sand. Behind is the vistaless  forest of the flat.    Run the boat on the sand at high-water, and the first step is planted in  primitive bush--fragrant, clean and undefiled. An empty jam tin or a  broken bottle, spoors of the rude hoofs of civilisation, you might search  for in vain. As difficult would it be to find either as a fellow to the  nugget of gold which legend tells was used by a naked black as a sinker  when he fished with hook of pearl shell out there on the edge of the  coral reef,    One superficial feature of our domain is distinct and peculiar, giving to  it an admirable character. From the landing-place--rather more up towards  the north-east cusp than the exact middle of the crescent bay--extends a  flat of black sand on which grows a dense bush of wattles, cockatoo  apple-trees, pandanus palms, Moreton Bay ash and other eucalypts, and the  shapely melaleuca. This flat, here about 150 yards in breadth, ends  abruptly at a steep bank which gives access to a plateau 60 feet above  sea-level. The regularity of the outline of this bank is remarkable.  Running in a more or less correct curve for a mile and a half, it  indicates a clear-cut difference between the flat and the plateau. The  toe of the bank rests upon sand, while the plateau is of  chocolate-coloured soil intermixed on the surface with flakes of slate;  and from this sure foundation springs the backbone of the island. On the  flat, the plateau, and the hillsides, the forest consists of similar  trees--alike in age and character for all the difference in soil--the one  tree that does not leave the flat being the tea or melaleuca. In some  places the jungle comes down to the water's edge, the long antennae of  the lawyer vine toying with the rod-like aerial roots of the mangrove.    The plateau is the park of the island, half a mile broad, and a mile and  more long. Upon it grows the best of the bloodwoods (EUCALYPTUS  CORYNBOSA), the red stringy bark (E. ROBUSTA), Moreton Bay ash (E.  TESSALARIS), various wattles, the gin-gee of the blacks (DIPLANTHERA  TETRAPHYLLA). PANDANUS AQUATICUS marks the courses and curves of some of  the gullies. A creek, hidden in a broad ribbon of jungle and running from  a ravine in the range to the sea, divides our park in fairly equal  portions.    Most part of the range is heavily draped with jungle--that is, on the  western aspect. Just above the splash of the Pacific surges on the  weather or eastern side, low-growing scrub and restricted areas of  forest, with expansive patches of jungle, plentifully intermixed with  palms and bananas, creep up the precipitous ascent to the summit of the  range--870 feet above the sea. So steep is the Pacific slope that,  standing on the top of the ridge and looking down, you catch mosaic  gleams of the sea among the brown and grey tree-trunks. But for the  prodigality of the vegetation, one slide might take you from the cool  mountain-top to the cooler sea. The highest peak, which presents a  buttressed face to the north, and overlooks our peaceful bay, is crowned  with a forest of bloodwoods, upon which the jungle steadily encroaches.  The swaying fronds of aspiring palms, adorned in due season with masses  of straw-coloured inflorescence, to be succeeded by loose bunches of red,  bead-like berries, shoot out from the pall of leafage. In the gloomy  gullies are slender-shafted palms and tree-ferns, while ferns and mosses  cover the soil with living tapestry, and strange, snake-like epiphytes  cling in sinuous curves to the larger trees. The trail of the lawyer vine  (CALAMUS OBSTRUENS), with its leaf sheath and long tentacles bristling  with incurved hooks, is over it all. Huge cables of vines trail from tree  to tree, hanging in loops and knots and festoons, the largest (ENTADA  SCANDENS) bearing pods 4 feet long and 4 inches broad, containing a dozen  or so brown hard beans used for match-boxes. Along the edge of the  jungle, the climbing fern (LYNGODIUM) grows in tangled masses sending its  slender wire-like lengths up among the trees--the most attractive of all  the ferns, and glorified by some with the title of \"the Fern of God,\" so  surpassing its grace and beauty.    September is the prime month of the year in tropical Queensland. Many of  the trees are then in blossom and most of the orchids. Nocturnal showers  occur fairly regularly in normal seasons, and every sort of vegetable is  rampant with the lust of life. It was September when our isolation began.  And what a plenteous"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/512"],[0,"Mosses from an Old Manse, and Other Stories (#3)"],[1,"which all  the world, and chiefly the quaffer of the immortal nostrum, would find  cause to curse.    \"Aylmer, are you in earnest?\" asked Georgiana, looking at him with  amazement and fear. \"It is terrible to possess such power, or even to  dream of possessing it.\"    \"Oh, do not tremble, my love,\" said her husband. \"I would not wrong  either you or myself by working such inharmonious effects upon our  lives; but I would have you consider how trifling, in comparison, is  the skill requisite to remove this little hand.\"    At the mention of the birthmark, Georgiana, as usual, shrank as if a  redhot iron had touched her cheek.    Again Aylmer applied himself to his labors. She could hear his voice in  the distant furnace room giving directions to Aminadab, whose harsh,  uncouth, misshapen tones were audible in response, more like the grunt  or growl of a brute than human speech. After hours of absence, Aylmer  reappeared and proposed that she should now examine his cabinet of  chemical products and natural treasures of the earth. Among the former  he showed her a small vial, in which, he remarked, was contained a  gentle yet most powerful fragrance, capable of impregnating all the  breezes that blow across a kingdom. They were of inestimable value, the  contents of that little vial; and, as he said so, he threw some of the  perfume into the air and filled the room with piercing and invigorating  delight.    \"And what is this?\" asked Georgiana, pointing to a small crystal globe  containing a gold-colored liquid. \"It is so beautiful to the eye that I  could imagine it the elixir of life.\"    \"In one sense it is,\" replied Aylmer; \"or, rather, the elixir of  immortality. It is the most precious poison that ever was concocted in  this world. By its aid I could apportion the lifetime of any mortal at  whom you might point your finger. The strength of the dose would  determine whether he were to linger out years, or drop dead in the  midst of a breath. No king on his guarded throne could keep his life if  I, in my private station, should deem that the welfare of millions  justified me in depriving him of it.\"    \"Why do you keep such a terrific drug?\" inquired Georgiana in horror.    \"Do not mistrust me, dearest,\" said her husband, smiling; \"its virtuous  potency is yet greater than its harmful one. But see! here is a  powerful cosmetic. With a few drops of this in a vase of water,  freckles may be washed away as easily as the hands are cleansed. A  stronger infusion would take the blood out of the cheek, and leave the  rosiest beauty a pale ghost.\"    \"Is it with this lotion that you intend to bathe my cheek?\" asked  Georgiana, anxiously.    \"Oh, no,\" hastily replied her husband; \"this is merely superficial.  Your case demands a remedy that shall go deeper.\"    In his interviews with Georgiana, Aylmer generally made minute  inquiries as to her sensations and whether the confinement of the rooms  and the temperature of the atmosphere agreed with her. These questions  had such a particular drift that Georgiana began to conjecture that she  was already subjected to certain physical influences, either breathed  in with the fragrant air or taken with her food. She fancied likewise,  but it might be altogether fancy, that there was a stirring up of her  system--a strange, indefinite sensation creeping through her veins, and  tingling, half painfully, half pleasurably, at her heart. Still,  whenever she dared to look into the mirror, there she beheld herself  pale as a white rose and with the crimson birthmark stamped upon her  cheek. Not even Aylmer now hated it so much as she.    To dispel the tedium of the hours which her husband found it necessary  to devote to the processes of combination and analysis, Georgiana  turned over the volumes of his scientific library. In many dark old  tomes she met with chapters full of romance and poetry. They were the  works of philosophers of the middle ages, such as Albertus Magnus,  Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, and the famous friar who created the  prophetic Brazen Head. All these antique naturalists stood in advance  of their centuries, yet were imbued with some of their credulity, and  therefore were believed, and perhaps imagined themselves to have  acquired from the investigation of Nature a power above Nature, and  from physics a sway over the spiritual world. Hardly less curious and  imaginative were the early volumes of the Transactions of the Royal  Society, in which the members, knowing little of the limits of natural  possibility, were continually recording wonders or proposing methods  whereby wonders might be wrought.    But to Georgiana the most engrossing volume was a large folio from her  husband's own hand, in which he had recorded every experiment of his  scientific career, its original aim, the methods adopted for its  development, and its final success or failure, with the circumstances  to which either event was attributable. The book, in truth, was both  the history and emblem of his ardent, ambitious, imaginative, yet  practical and laborious life. He handled physical details as if there  were nothing beyond them; yet spiritualized them all, and redeemed  himself from materialism by his strong and eager aspiration towards the  infinite. In his grasp the veriest clod of earth assumed a soul.  Georgiana, as she read, reverenced Aylmer and loved him more profoundly  than ever, but with a less entire dependence on his judgment than  heretofore. Much as he had accomplished, she could not but observe that  his most splendid successes were almost invariably failures, if  compared with the ideal at which he aimed. His brightest diamonds were  the merest pebbles, and felt to be so by himself, in comparison with  the inestimable gems which lay hidden beyond his reach. The volume,  rich with achievements that had won renown for its author, was yet as  melancholy a record as ever mortal hand had penned. It was the sad  confession and continual exemplification of the shortcomings of the  composite man, the spirit burdened with clay and working in matter, and  of the despair that assails the higher nature at finding itself so  miserably thwarted by the earthly part. Perhaps every man of genius in  whatever sphere might recognize the image of his own experience in  Aylmer's journal.    So deeply did these reflections affect Georgiana that she laid her face  upon the open volume and burst into tears. In this situation she was  found by her husband.    \"It is dangerous to read in a sorcerer's books,\" said he with a smile,  though his countenance was uneasy and displeased. \"Georgiana, there are  pages in that volume which I can scarcely glance over and keep my  senses. Take heed lest it prove as detrimental to you.\"    \"It has made me worship you more than ever,\" said she.    \"Ah, wait for this one success,\" rejoined he, \"then worship me if you  will. I shall deem myself hardly unworthy of it. But come, I have  sought you for the luxury of your voice. Sing to me, dearest.\"    So she poured out the liquid music of her voice to quench the thirst of  his spirit. He then took his leave with a boyish exuberance of gayety,  assuring her that her seclusion would endure but a little longer, and  that the result was already certain. Scarcely had he departed when  Georgiana felt irresistibly impelled to follow him. She had forgotten  to inform Aylmer of a symptom which for two or three hours past had  begun to excite her attention. It was a sensation in the fatal  birthmark, not painful, but which induced a restlessness throughout her  system. Hastening after her husband, she intruded for the first time  into the laboratory.    The first thing that struck her eye was the furnace, that hot and  feverish worker, with the intense glow of its fire, which by the  quantities of soot clustered above it seemed to have been burning for  ages. There was a distilling apparatus in full operation. Around the  room were retorts, tubes, cylinders, crucibles, and other apparatus of  chemical research. An electrical machine stood ready for immediate use.  The atmosphere felt oppressively close, and was tainted with gaseous  odors which had been tormented forth by the processes of science. The  severe and homely simplicity of the apartment, with its naked walls and  brick pavement, looked strange, accustomed as Georgiana had become to  the fantastic elegance of her boudoir. But what chiefly, indeed almost  solely, drew her attention, was the aspect of Aylmer himself.    He was pale as death, anxious and absorbed, and hung over the furnace  as if it depended upon his utmost watchfulness whether the liquid which  it was distilling should be the draught of immortal happiness or  misery. How different from the sanguine and joyous mien that he had  assumed for Georgiana's encouragement!    \"Carefully now, Aminadab; carefully, thou human machine; carefully,  thou man of clay!\" muttered Aylmer, more to himself than his assistant.  \"Now, if there be a thought too much or too little, it is all over.\"    \"Ho! ho!\" mumbled Aminadab. \"Look, master! look!\"    Aylmer raised his eyes hastily, and at first reddened, then grew paler  than ever, on beholding Georgiana. He rushed towards her and seized her  arm with a gripe that left the print of his fingers upon it.    \"Why do you come hither? Have you no trust in your husband?\" cried he,  impetuously. \"Would you throw the blight of that fatal birthmark over  my labors? It is not well done. Go, prying woman, go!\"    \"Nay, Aylmer,\" said Georgiana with the firmness of which she possessed  no stinted endowment, \"it is not you that have a right to complain. You  mistrust your wife; you have concealed the anxiety with which you watch  the development of this experiment. Think not so unworthily of me, my  husband. Tell me all the risk we run, and fear not that I shall shrink;  for my share in it is far less than your own.\"    \"No, no, Georgiana!\" said Aylmer, impatiently; \"it "]]]
