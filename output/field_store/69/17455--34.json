Besides, I like to help everything that's goin' on.\"    Tom Hall and one or two others went out hurriedly to have a drink. But  we all loved the Giraffe.    He was very innocent and very humorous, especially when he meant to be  most serious and philosophical.    \"Some of them bush girls is regular tomboys,\" he said to me solemnly  one day. \"Some of them is too cheeky altogether. I remember once I was  stoppin' at a place--they was sort of relations o' mine--an' they put me  to sleep in a room off the verander, where there was a glass door an'  no blinds. An' the first mornin' the girls--they was sort o' cousins  o' mine--they come gigglin' and foolin' round outside the door on the  verander, an' kep' me in bed till nearly ten o'clock. I had to put me  trowsis on under the bed-clothes in the end. But I got back on 'em the  next night,\" he reflected.    \"How did you do that, Bob?\" I asked.    \"Why, I went to bed in me trowsis!\"      One day I was on a plank, painting the ceiling of the bar of the Great  Western Hotel. I was anxious to get the job finished. The work had been  kept back most of the day by chaps handing up long beers to me, and  drawing my attention to the alleged fact that I was putting on the paint  wrong side out. I was slapping it on over the last few boards when:    \"I'm very sorry to trouble yer; I always seem to be troublin' yer; but  there's that there woman and them girls----\"    I looked down--about the first time I had looked down on him--and there  was the Giraffe, with his hat brim up on the plank and two half-crowns  in it.    \"Oh, that's all right, Bob,\" I said, and I dropped in half a crown.    There were shearers in the bar, and presently there was some barracking.  It appeared that that there woman and them girls were strange women, in  the local as well as the Biblical sense of the word, who had come from  Sydney at the end of the shearing-season, and had taken a cottage on the  edge of the scrub on the outskirts of the town. There had been trouble  this week in connection with a row at their establishment, and they had  been fined, warned off by the police, and turned out by their landlord.    \"This is a bit too red-hot, Giraffe,\" said one of the shearers. \"Them  ----s has made enough out of us coves. They've got plenty of stuff,  don't you fret. Let 'em go to ----! I'm blanked if I give a sprat.\"    \"They ain't got their fares to Sydney,\" said the Giraffe. \"An', what's  more, the little 'un is sick, an' two of them has kids in Sydney.\"    \"How the ---- do you know?\"    \"Why, one of 'em come to me an' told me all about it.\"    There was an involuntary guffaw.    \"Look here, Bob,\" said Billy Woods, the rouseabouts' secretary, kindly.  \"Don't you make a fool of yourself. You'll have all the chaps laughing  at you. Those girls are only working you for all you're worth. I suppose  one of 'em came crying and whining to you. Don't you bother about 'em.  _You_ don't know 'em; they can pump water at a moment's notice. You  haven't had any experience with women yet, Bob.\"    \"She didn't come whinin' and cryin' to me,\" said the Giraffe, dropping  his twanging drawl a little. \"She looked me straight in the face an'  told me all about it.\"    \"I say, Giraffe,\" said Box-o'-Tricks, \"what have you been doin'? You've  bin down there on the nod. I'm surprised at yer, Giraffe.\"    \"An' he pretends to be so gory soft an' innocent, too,\" growled the  Bogan. \"We know all about you, Giraffe.\"    \"Look here, Giraffe,\" said Mitchell the shearer. \"I'd never have thought  it of you. We all thought you were the only virgin youth west the river;  I always thought you were a moral young man. You mustn't think that  because your conscience is pricking you everyone else's is.\"    \"I ain't had anythin' to do with them,\" said the Giraffe, drawling  again. \"I ain't a cove that goes in for that sort of thing. But other  chaps has, and I think they might as well help 'em out of their fix.\"    \"They're a rotten crowd,\" said Billy Woods. \"You don't know them, Bob.  Don't bother about them-they're not worth it. Put your money in your  pocket. You'll find a better use for it before next shearing.\"    \"Better shout, Giraffe,\" said Box-o'-Tricks.    Now in spite of the Giraffe's softness he was the hardest man in Bourke  to move when he'd decided on what he thought was \"the fair thing to do.\"  Another peculiarity of his was that on occasion, such for instance as  \"sayin' a few words\" at a strike meeting, he would straighten himself,  drop the twang, and rope in his drawl, so to speak.    \"Well, look here, you chaps,\" he said now. \"I don't know anything about  them women. I s'pose they're bad, but I don't suppose they're worse than  men has made them. All I know is that there's four women turned out,  without any stuff, and every woman in Bourke, an' the police, an' the  law agen 'em. An' the fact that they is women is agenst 'em most of all.  You don't expect 'em to hump their swags to Sydney! Why, only I ain't  got the stuff I wouldn't trouble yer. I'd pay their fares meself. Look,\"  he said, lowering his voice, \"there they are now, an' one of the girls  is cryin'. Don't let 'em see yer lookin'.\"    I dropped softly from the plank and peeped out with the rest.    They stood by the fence on the opposite side of the street, a bit up  towards the railway station, with their portmanteaux and bundles at  their feet. One girl leant with her arms on the fence rail and her face  buried in them, another was trying to comfort her. The third girl and  the woman stood facing our way. The woman was good-looking; she had a  hard face, but it might have been made hard. The third girl seemed half  defiant, half inclined to cry. Presently she went to the other side of  the girl who was crying on the fence and put her arm round her shoulder.  The woman suddenly turned her back on us and stood looking away over the  paddocks.    The hat went round. Billy Woods was first, then Box-o'-Tricks, and then  Mitchell.    Billy contributed with eloquent silence. \"I was only jokin', Giraffe,\"  said Box-o'-Tricks, dredging his pockets for a couple of shillings. It  was some time after the shearing, and most of the chaps were hard up.  \"Ah, well,\" sighed Mitchell. \"There's no help for it. If the Giraffe  would take up a collection to import some decent girls to this  God-forgotten hole there might be some sense in it.... It's bad enough  for the Giraffe to undermine our religious prejudices, and tempt us  to take a morbid interest in sick Chows and Afghans, and blacklegs and  widows; but when he starts mixing us up with strange women it's time to  buck.\" And he prospected his pockets and contributed two shillings, some  odd pennies, and a pinch of tobacco dust.    \"I don't mind helping the girls, but I'm damned if I'll give a penny to  help the old ----,\" said Tom Hall.    \"Well, she was a girl once herself,\" drawled the Giraffe.    The Giraffe went round to the other pubs and to the union offices, and  when he returned he seemed satisfied with the plate, but troubled about  something else.    \"I don't know what to do for them for to-night,\" he said. \"None of the  pubs or boardin'-houses will hear of them, an' there ain't no empty  houses, an' the women is all agen 'em.\"    \"Not all,\" said Alice, the big, handsome barmaid from Sydney. \"Come  here, Bob.\" She gave the Giraffe half a sovereign and a look for which  some of us would have paid him ten pounds--had we had the money, and had  the look been transferable.    \"Wait a minute, Bob,\" she said, and she went in to speak to the  landlord.    \"There's an empty bedroom at the end of the store in the yard,\" she said  when she came back. \"They can camp there for to-night if they behave  themselves. You'd better tell 'em, Bob.\"    \"Thank yer, Alice,\" said the Giraffe.    Next day, after work, the Giraffe and I drifted together and down by  the river in the cool of the evening, and sat on the edge of the steep,  drought-parched bank.    \"I heard you saw your lady friends off this morning, Bob,\" I said, and  was sorry I said it, even before he answered.    \"Oh, they ain't no friends of mine,\" he said. \"Only four' poor devils of  women. I thought they mightn't like to stand waitin' with the crowd on  the platform, so I jest offered to get their tickets an' told 'em to  wait round at the back of the station till the bell rung.... An' what  do yer think they did, Harry?\" he went on, with an exasperatingly  unintelligent grin. \"Why, they wanted to kiss me.\"    \"Did they?\"    \"Yes. An' they would have done it, too, if I hadn't been so long....  Why, I'm blessed if they didn't kiss me hands.\"    \"You don't say so.\"    \"God's truth. Somehow I didn't like to go on the platform with them  after that; besides, they was cryin', and I can't stand women cryin'.  But some of the chaps put them into an empty carriage.\" He thought a  moment. Then:    \"There's some terrible good-hearted fellers in the world,\" he reflected.    I thought so too. \"Bob,\" I said, \"you're a single man. Why don't you get  married and settle down?\"    \"Well,\" he said, \"I ain't got no wife an' kids, that's a fact. But it  ain't my fault.\"    He may have been right about the wife. But I thought of the look that  Alice had given him, and--    \"Girls seem to like me right enough,\" he said, \"but it don't go no  further than that. The trouble is that I'm so long, and I always seem  to get shook after little girls. At least there was one little girl in  Bendigo that I was properly gone on.\"    \"And wouldn't she have you?\"    \"Well, it seems not.\"    \"Did you ask her?\"    \"Oh, yes, I asked her right enough.\"    \"Well, and what did she say?\"    \"She said it would be redicilus for her to be seen trottin' alongside of  a chimbley like me.\"    \"Perhaps she didn't mean that. There are any amount of little women who  like tall men.\"    \"I thought of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7070"],[0,"The Treasure of the Incas: A Story of Adventure in Peru (#3)"],[1,"life he saved when he was  attacked by some beast or other, and this man as much as hinted that he  knew of a place where treasure might be concealed; but as Barnett was  interested in beasts and plants and that sort of thing, and had a  comfortable fortune, he never troubled himself about it one way or  another. Well, he offered to give me a letter to this man, and he  regarded it as just possible that the fellow, who seems to be a  descendant of some of the people who were members of the Incas' court  at the time the Spaniards came, may have some knowledge of the rich  mines that were then closed down, and that he may be able to show them  to me, from his feeling of gratitude to Barnett. It is but one chance  in a million, and as I can see no other possibility of making a fortune  in two years, I am going to try it.\"    \"Of course you will,\" the lad said excitedly, \"and I should think that  you would take me with you.\"    \"I certainly had not dreamt of doing so, Bertie. But if I have to keep  on getting fresh outfits for you, the idea has come into my mind during  the last half-hour that I could not do better.\"    \"Harry, you are sure to be disappointed lots of times before you hit on  a treasure, and then if you were all by yourself you would get down in  the mouth. Now, I should be able to keep you going, pat you on the back  when you felt sick, help you to fight Indians and wild beasts, and be  useful in all sorts of ways.\"    \"That is like your impudence, Bertie,\" the other laughed. \"Seriously, I  know I shall be a fool to take you, and if I really thought I had any  chance to speak of I should not do so; but though I am going to try, I  don't expect for a moment that I shall succeed. I feel that really it  would be a comfort to have someone with me upon whom I could rely in  such a life as I should have to lead. It certainly would be lonely work  for one man. The only doubt in my mind is whether it will be fair to  you--you have got your profession.\"    \"But I can go back to it if nothing good turns up, Harry. I can visit  the firm and tell them that I am going to travel with you for a bit,  and hope that on my return they will take me back again and let me  finish my apprenticeship. I should think they would be rather glad, for  they always build and never buy ships, and it will take them six months  to replace the _Stella_. Besides, it will do me a lot of good. I shall  pick up Spanish--at least, I suppose that is the language they speak  out there--and shall learn no end of things. As you know, we trade with  the west coast of America, so I should be a lot more useful to the firm  when I come back than I am now.\"    \"Well, I will think it over, and let you know in the morning. I must  certainly consult Mr. Barnett, for he is your trustee as well as mine.  If we go I shall work my way out. It will be a big expense, anyhow, and  I don't mean, if possible, to draw upon my capital beyond three or four  hundred pounds. I believe living is cheap out there, and if I buy three  or four mules I shall then have to pay only the wages for the  muleteers, and the expenses of living. Of course I shall arrange for my  income and half-pay to be sent out to some firm at Lima. Now, you had  better go off to bed, and don't buoy yourself up with the belief that  you are going, for I have by no means decided upon taking you yet.\"    \"You will decide to take me, Harry,\" the lad said confidently, and then  added with a laugh: \"the fact that you should have adopted a plan like  this is quite sufficient to show that you want somebody to look after  you.\"    Harry Prendergast did not get much sleep that night. He blamed himself  for having mentioned the matter at all to Bertie, and yet the more he  thought over it the more he felt that it would be very pleasant to have  his brother with him. The lad was full of fun and mischief, but he knew  that he had plenty of sound sense, and would be a capital companion,  and the fact that he had been three years at sea, and was accustomed to  turn his hand to anything, was all in his favour. If nothing came of it  he would only have lost a couple of years, and, as the boy himself had  said, the time would not have been altogether wasted. Bertie was down  before him in the morning. He looked anxiously at his brother as he  came in.    \"Well, Harry?\"    \"Well, I have thought it over in every light. But in the first place,  Bertie, if you go with me you will have to remember that I am your  commanding officer. I am ten years older than you, and besides I am a  lieutenant in the King's Navy, while you are only a midshipman in the  merchant service. Now, I shall expect as ready obedience from you as if  I were captain of my own ship and you one of my men; that is absolutely  essential.\"    \"Of course, Harry, it could not be otherwise.\"    \"Very well, then; in the next place I shall abide by what Mr. Barnett  says. He is your guardian as well as trustee, and has a perfect right  to put a veto upon any wild expedition of this sort. Lastly, I should  hope, although I don't say that this is absolutely necessary, that you  may get your employer's promise to take you back again in order that  you may complete your time.\"    \"Thank you very much, Harry!\" the lad said gratefully. \"The first  condition you may rely upon being performed, and I think the third will  be all right, for I know that I have always been favourably reported  upon. Old Prosser told me so himself when he said that I should have a  rise in my pay this voyage. As to Mr. Barnett, of course I can't say,  but I should think, as it was he who put you up to this, he must see  that it would be good for you to have someone to take care of you.\"    \"I think he is much more likely to say that I shall have quite enough  to do to take care of myself, without having the bother of looking  after you. However, I will go and see him this morning. You had better  call upon your employers.\"    \"Don't you think I had better go to Mr. Barnett with you, Harry?\"    \"Not as you are now anyhow, Bertie. Your appearance is positively  disgraceful. You evidently had on your worst suit of clothes when you  were wrecked, and I can see that they have not been improved by the  experience. Why, there is a split right down one sleeve, and a big rent  in your trousers!\"    \"I got them climbing on board, for I had no time to pick and choose,  with the _Stella_ sinking under my feet.\"    \"Well, you may as well go as you are, but you had better borrow a  needle and thread from the landlady and mend up the holes. You really  cannot walk through the city in that state. I will see about getting  you some more clothes when we get back, for I cannot have you coming  here in these in broad daylight. Here are three guineas; get yourself a  suit of pilot cloth at some outfitter's at the East End. It will be  useful to you anyhow, whether you go with me or ship again here.\"    \"There is a good deal in what you say, Harry,\" Mr. Barnett said when  Prendergast asked his opinion as to his taking his brother with him.  \"Two years would not make any material difference in his career as a  sailor; it simply means that he will be so much older when he passes as  mate. There is no harm in that. Two or three and twenty is quite young  enough for a young fellow to become an officer, and I don't think that  many captains care about having lads who have just got their  certificate. They have not the same sense of responsibility or the same  power of managing. Then, too, Bertie will certainly have a good deal of  knocking about if he spends a couple of years in South America, and the  knowledge he will gain of Spanish will add to his value with any firm  trading on that coast. As far as you are concerned, I think it would be  a great advantage to have him with you. In a long expedition, such as  you propose, it is a gain to have a companion with you. It makes the  work more pleasant, and two men can laugh over hardships and  disagreeables that one alone would grumble at; but apart from this, it  is very important in case of illness.    \"A lonely man laid up with fever, or accidental injury, fares badly  indeed if he is at a distance from any town where he can obtain medical  attendance, and surrounded only by ignorant natives. I was myself at  one time down with fever for six weeks in a native hut, and during that  time I would have given pretty nearly all that I was worth for the  sight of a white face and the sound of an English voice. As to the fact  that it is possible that the lad might catch fever, or be killed in an  affray with natives, that must, of course, be faced; but as a sailor he  runs the risk of shipwreck, or of being washed overboard, or killed by  a falling spar. Everything considered, I think the idea of his going  with you is a good one. I don't suppose that many guardians would be of  the same opinion, but I have been so many years knocking about in one  part of the world or another, that I don't look at things in the same  light as men who have never been out of England.\"    \"I am glad you see it in that way, sir. I own that it would be a great  satisfaction to have him with me. He certainly would be a cheery  companion, and I should say that he is as hard as nails, and can stand  as much fatigue and hardship as myself. Besides, there is no doubt that  in case of any trouble two men are better than one.\"    \"I cannot advance any money out of the thousand pounds that will come  to him when he is of age. By your father's will it was ordered that, in  the event of his own death before that time, the interest was to  accumulate. Your father foresaw that, like you, probably Bertie would  take to the sea, and as the amount would be fully two thousand pounds  by the time he comes of age, it would enable him to buy a share in any  ship that he might, when he passed his last examination, command; but I  will myself draw a cheque for a hundred pounds, which will help"]]]
