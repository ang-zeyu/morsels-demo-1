In rare and isolated  cases, it may really have happened that such a Will to Truth--a certain  extravagant and adventurous pluck, a metaphysician's ambition of the  forlorn hope--has participated therein: that which in the end always  prefers a handful of \"certainty\" to a whole cartload of beautiful  possibilities; there may even be puritanical fanatics of conscience,  who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing, rather than in an  uncertain something. But that is Nihilism, and the sign of a despairing,  mortally wearied soul, notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a  virtue may display. It seems, however, to be otherwise with stronger  and livelier thinkers who are still eager for life. In that they side  AGAINST appearance, and speak superciliously of \"perspective,\" in  that they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as the  credibility of the ocular evidence that \"the earth stands still,\" and  thus, apparently, allowing with complacency their securest possession  to escape (for what does one at present believe in more firmly than  in one's body?),--who knows if they are not really trying to win back  something which was formerly an even securer possession, something  of the old domain of the faith of former times, perhaps the \"immortal  soul,\" perhaps \"the old God,\" in short, ideas by which they could live  better, that is to say, more vigorously and more joyously, than by  \"modern ideas\"? There is DISTRUST of these modern ideas in this mode  of looking at things, a disbelief in all that has been constructed  yesterday and today; there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety  and scorn, which can no longer endure the BRIC-A-BRAC of ideas of the  most varied origin, such as so-called Positivism at present throws on  the market; a disgust of the more refined taste at the village-fair  motleyness and patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters, in whom  there is nothing either new or true, except this motleyness. Therein it  seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical anti-realists and  knowledge-microscopists of the present day; their instinct, which repels  them from MODERN reality, is unrefuted... what do their retrograde  by-paths concern us! The main thing about them is NOT that they wish  to go \"back,\" but that they wish to get AWAY therefrom. A little MORE  strength, swing, courage, and artistic power, and they would be OFF--and  not back!    11. It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to  divert attention from the actual influence which Kant exercised on  German philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value which  he set upon himself. Kant was first and foremost proud of his Table of  Categories; with it in his hand he said: \"This is the most difficult  thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.\" Let us  only understand this \"could be\"! He was proud of having DISCOVERED a  new faculty in man, the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori. Granting  that he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid  flourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, and  on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible  something--at all events \"new faculties\"--of which to be still  prouder!--But let us reflect for a moment--it is high time to do so.  \"How are synthetic judgments a priori POSSIBLE?\" Kant asks himself--and  what is really his answer? \"BY MEANS OF A MEANS (faculty)\"--but  unfortunately not in five words, but so circumstantially, imposingly,  and with such display of German profundity and verbal flourishes, that  one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved  in such an answer. People were beside themselves with delight over this  new faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant further  discovered a moral faculty in man--for at that time Germans were still  moral, not yet dabbling in the \"Politics of hard fact.\" Then came  the honeymoon of German philosophy. All the young theologians of the  Tubingen institution went immediately into the groves--all seeking for  \"faculties.\" And what did they not find--in that innocent, rich, and  still youthful period of the German spirit, to which Romanticism, the  malicious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish  between \"finding\" and \"inventing\"! Above all a faculty for the  \"transcendental\"; Schelling christened it, intellectual intuition,  and thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally  pious-inclined Germans. One can do no greater wrong to the whole of  this exuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness,  notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly, in hoary and senile  conceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with moral  indignation. Enough, however--the world grew older, and the dream  vanished. A time came when people rubbed their foreheads, and they still  rub them today. People had been dreaming, and first and foremost--old  Kant. \"By means of a means (faculty)\"--he had said, or at least meant to  say. But, is that--an answer? An explanation? Or is it not rather merely  a repetition of the question? How does opium induce sleep? \"By means of  a means (faculty),\" namely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in  Moliere,        Quia est in eo virtus dormitiva,      Cujus est natura sensus assoupire.    But such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is high time  to replace the Kantian question, \"How are synthetic judgments a PRIORI  possible?\" by another question, \"Why is belief in such judgments  necessary?\"--in effect, it is high time that we should understand  that such judgments must be believed to be true, for the sake of the  preservation of creatures like ourselves; though they still might  naturally be false judgments! Or, more plainly spoken, and roughly and  readily--synthetic judgments a priori should not \"be possible\" at all;  we have no right to them; in our mouths they are nothing but false  judgments. Only, of course, the belief in their truth is necessary, as  plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view  of life. And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence which  \"German philosophy\"--I hope you understand its right to inverted commas  (goosefeet)?--has exercised throughout the whole of Europe, there is  no doubt that a certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it; thanks to  German philosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous,  the mystics, the artiste, the three-fourths Christians, and the  political obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to the still  overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into  this, in short--\"sensus assoupire.\"...    12. As regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best-refuted  theories that have been advanced, and in Europe there is now perhaps  no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious  signification to it, except for convenient everyday use (as an  abbreviation of the means of expression)--thanks chiefly to the Pole  Boscovich: he and the Pole Copernicus have hitherto been the greatest  and most successful opponents of ocular evidence. For while Copernicus  has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the senses, that the earth  does NOT stand fast, Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the  last thing that \"stood fast\" of the earth--the belief in \"substance,\" in  \"matter,\" in the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest  triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth. One  must, however, go still further, and also declare war, relentless war  to the knife, against the \"atomistic requirements\" which still lead a  dangerous after-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more  celebrated \"metaphysical requirements\": one must also above all give  the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which  Christianity has taught best and longest, the SOUL-ATOMISM. Let it be  permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the  soul as something indestructible, eternal, indivisible, as a monad,  as an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science! Between  ourselves, it is not at all necessary to get rid of \"the soul\" thereby,  and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypotheses--as  happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists, who can hardly  touch on the soul without immediately losing it. But the way is open  for new acceptations and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and such  conceptions as \"mortal soul,\" and \"soul of subjective multiplicity,\"  and \"soul as social structure of the instincts and passions,\" want  henceforth to have legitimate rights in science. In that the NEW  psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have  hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of  the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into a new desert  and a new distrust--it is possible that the older psychologists had a  merrier and more comfortable time of it; eventually, however, he finds  that precisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENT--and, who knows?  perhaps to DISCOVER the new.    13. Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the  instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic  being. A living thing seeks above all to DISCHARGE its strength--life  itself is WILL TO POWER; self-preservation is only one of the indirect  and most frequent RESULTS thereof. In short, here, as everywhere else,  let us beware of SUPERFLUOUS teleological principles!--one of which  is the instinct of self-preservation (we owe it to Spinoza's  inconsistency). It is thus, in effect, that method ordains, which must  be essentially economy of principles.    14. It"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4367"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Complete (#3)"],[1,"education of his children. Consequently, as stated before, I never  missed a quarter from school from the time I was old enough to attend  till the time of leaving home.  This did not exempt me from labor.  In  my early days, every one labored more or less, in the region where my  youth was spent, and more in proportion to their private means.  It was  only the very poor who were exempt.  While my father carried on the  manufacture of leather and worked at the trade himself, he owned and  tilled considerable land.  I detested the trade, preferring almost any  other labor; but I was fond of agriculture, and of all employment in  which horses were used.  We had, among other lands, fifty acres of  forest within a mile of the village.  In the fall of the year choppers  were employed to cut enough wood to last a twelve-month.  When I was  seven or eight years of age, I began hauling all the wood used in the  house and shops.  I could not load it on the wagons, of course, at that  time, but I could drive, and the choppers would load, and some one at  the house unload.  When about eleven years old, I was strong enough to  hold a plough.  From that age until seventeen I did all the work done  with horses, such as breaking up the land, furrowing, ploughing corn and  potatoes, bringing in the crops when harvested, hauling all the wood,  besides tending two or three horses, a cow or two, and sawing wood for  stoves, etc., while still attending school.  For this I was compensated  by the fact that there was never any scolding or punishing by my  parents; no objection to rational enjoyments, such as fishing, going to  the creek a mile away to swim in summer, taking a horse and visiting my  grandparents in the adjoining county, fifteen miles off, skating on the  ice in winter, or taking a horse and sleigh when there was snow on the  ground.    While still quite young I had visited Cincinnati, forty-five miles away,  several times, alone; also Maysville, Kentucky, often, and once  Louisville.  The journey to Louisville was a big one for a boy of that  day.  I had also gone once with a two-horse carriage to Chilicothe,  about seventy miles, with a neighbor's family, who were removing to  Toledo, Ohio, and returned alone; and had gone once, in like manner, to  Flat Rock, Kentucky, about seventy miles away.  On this latter occasion  I was fifteen years of age.  While at Flat Rock, at the house of a Mr.  Payne, whom I was visiting with his brother, a neighbor of ours in  Georgetown, I saw a very fine saddle horse, which I rather coveted, and  proposed to Mr. Payne, the owner, to trade him for one of the two I was  driving.  Payne hesitated to trade with a boy, but asking his brother  about it, the latter told him that it would be all right, that I was  allowed to do as I pleased with the horses.  I was seventy miles from  home, with a carriage to take back, and Mr. Payne said he did not know  that his horse had ever had a collar on.  I asked to have him hitched to  a farm wagon and we would soon see whether he would work.  It was soon  evident that the horse had never worn harness before; but he showed no  viciousness, and I expressed a confidence that I could manage him.  A  trade was at once struck, I receiving ten dollars difference.    The next day Mr. Payne, of Georgetown, and I started on our return.  We  got along very well for a few miles, when we encountered a ferocious dog  that frightened the horses and made them run.  The new animal kicked at  every jump he made.  I got the horses stopped, however, before any  damage was done, and without running into anything.  After giving them a  little rest, to quiet their fears, we started again.  That instant the  new horse kicked, and started to run once more.  The road we were on,  struck the turnpike within half a mile of the point where the second  runaway commenced, and there there was an embankment twenty or more feet  deep on the opposite side of the pike.  I got the horses stopped on the  very brink of the precipice.  My new horse was terribly frightened and  trembled like an aspen; but he was not half so badly frightened as my  companion, Mr. Payne, who deserted me after this last experience, and  took passage on a freight wagon for Maysville.  Every time I attempted  to start, my new horse would commence to kick.  I was in quite a dilemma  for a time.  Once in Maysville I could borrow a horse from an uncle who  lived there; but I was more than a day's travel from that point.  Finally I took out my bandanna--the style of handkerchief in universal  use then--and with this blindfolded my horse.  In this way I reached  Maysville safely the next day, no doubt much to the surprise of my  friend.  Here I borrowed a horse from my uncle, and the following day we  proceeded on our journey.    About half my school-days in Georgetown were spent at the school of John  D. White, a North Carolinian, and the father of Chilton White who  represented the district in Congress for one term during the rebellion.  Mr. White was always a Democrat in politics, and Chilton followed his  father.  He had two older brothers--all three being school-mates of mine  at their father's school--who did not go the same way.  The second  brother died before the rebellion began; he was a Whig, and afterwards a  Republican.  His oldest brother was a Republican and brave soldier  during the rebellion.  Chilton is reported as having told of an earlier  horse-trade of mine.  As he told the story, there was a Mr. Ralston  living within a few miles of the village, who owned a colt which I very  much wanted.  My father had offered twenty dollars for it, but Ralston  wanted twenty-five.  I was so anxious to have the colt, that after the  owner left, I begged to be allowed to take him at the price demanded.  My father yielded, but said twenty dollars was all the horse was worth,  and told me to offer that price; if it was not accepted I was to offer  twenty-two and a half, and if that would not get him, to give the  twenty-five.  I at once mounted a horse and went for the colt.  When I  got to Mr. Ralston's house, I said to him:  \"Papa says I may offer you  twenty dollars for the colt, but if you won't take that, I am to offer  twenty-two and a half, and if you won't take that, to give you  twenty-five.\"  It would not require a Connecticut man to guess the price  finally agreed upon.  This story is nearly true.  I certainly showed  very plainly that I had come for the colt and meant to have him.  I  could not have been over eight years old at the time.  This transaction  caused me great heart-burning. The story got out among the boys of the  village, and it was a long time before I heard the last of it.  Boys  enjoy the misery of their companions, at least village boys in that day  did, and in later life I have found that all adults are not free from  the peculiarity.  I kept the horse until he was four years old, when he  went blind, and I sold him for twenty dollars.  When I went to Maysville  to school, in 1836, at the age of fourteen, I recognized my colt as one  of the blind horses working on the tread-wheel of the ferry-boat.    I have describes enough of my early life to give an impression of the  whole.  I did not like to work; but I did as much of it, while young, as  grown men can be hired to do in these days, and attended school at the  same time.  I had as many privileges as any boy in the village, and  probably more than most of them.  I have no recollection of ever having  been punished at home, either by scolding or by the rod.  But at school  the case was different.  The rod was freely used there, and I was not  exempt from its influence.  I can see John D. White--the school teacher  --now, with his long beech switch always in his hand.  It was not always  the same one, either.  Switches were brought in bundles, from a beech  wood near the school house, by the boys for whose benefit they were  intended.  Often a whole bundle would be used up in a single day.  I  never had any hard feelings against my teacher, either while attending  the school, or in later years when reflecting upon my experience.  Mr.  White was a kindhearted man, and was much respected by the community in  which he lived.  He only followed the universal custom of the period,  and that under which he had received his own education.        CHAPTER II.    WEST POINT--GRADUATION.    In the winter of 1838-9 I was attending school at Ripley, only ten miles  distant from Georgetown, but spent the Christmas holidays at home.  During this vacation my father received a letter from the Honorable  Thomas Morris, then United States Senator from Ohio.  When he read it he  said to me, \"Ulysses, I believe you are going to receive the  appointment.\"  \"What appointment?\"  I inquired.  \"To West Point; I have  applied for it.\"  \"But I won't go,\" I said.  He said he thought I would,  AND I THOUGHT SO TOO, IF HE DID.  I really had no objection to going to  West Point, except that I had a very exalted idea of the acquirements  necessary to get through.  I did not believe I possessed them, and could  not bear the idea of failing.  There had been four boys from our  village, or its immediate neighborhood, who had been graduated from West  Point, and never a failure of any one appointed from Georgetown, except  in the case of the one whose place I was to take.  He was the son of Dr.  Bailey, our nearest and most intimate neighbor.  Young Bailey had been  appointed in 1837.  Finding before the January examination following,  that he could not pass, he resigned and went to a private school, and  remained there until the following year, when he was reappointed.  Before the next examination he was dismissed.  Dr. Bailey was a proud  and sensitive man, and felt the failure of his son so keenly that he  forbade his return home.  There were no telegraphs in those days to  disseminate news rapidly, no railroads west of the Alleghanies, and but  few east;"]]]
