It seems likely that Antony desired to become again  the Roman, while Cleopatra wished him to thrust Rome aside and return  to Egypt with her, to reign there as an independent king. To her Rome  was almost a barbarian city. In it she could not hold sway as she could  in her beautiful Alexandria, with its blue skies and velvet turf and  tropical flowers. At Rome Antony would be distracted by the cares of  state, and she would lose her lover. At Alexandria she would have him  for her very own.    The clash came when the hostile fleets met off the promontory of  Actium. At its crisis Cleopatra, prematurely concluding that the battle  was lost, of a sudden gave the signal for retreat and put out to sea  with her fleet. This was the crucial moment. Antony, mastered by his  love, forgot all else, and in a swift ship started in pursuit of her,  abandoning his fleet and army to win or lose as fortune might decide.  For him the world was nothing; the dark-browed Queen of Egypt,  imperious and yet caressing, was everything. Never was such a prize and  never were such great hopes thrown carelessly away. After waiting seven  days Antony's troops, still undefeated, finding that their commander  would not return to them, surrendered to Octavian, who thus became the  master of an empire.    Later his legions assaulted Alexandria, and there Antony was twice  defeated. At last Cleopatra saw her great mistake. She had made her  lover give up the hope of being Rome's dictator, but in so doing she  had also lost the chance of ruling with him tranquilly in Egypt. She  shut herself behind the barred doors of the royal sepulcher; and, lest  she should be molested there, she sent forth word that she had died.  Her proud spirit could not brook the thought that she might be seized  and carried as a prisoner to Rome. She was too much a queen in soul to  be led in triumph up the Sacred Way to the Capitol with golden chains  clanking on her slender wrists.    Antony, believing the report that she was dead, fell upon his sword;  but in his dying moments he was carried into the presence of the woman  for whom he had given all. With her arms about him, his spirit passed  away; and soon after she, too, met death, whether by a poisoned draught  or by the storied asp no one can say.    Cleopatra had lived the mistress of a splendid kingdom. She had  successively captivated two of the greatest men whom Rome had ever  seen. She died, like a queen, to escape disgrace. Whatever modern  critics may have to say concerning small details, this story still  remains the strangest love story of which the world has any record.          ABELARD AND HELOISE      Many a woman, amid the transports of passionate and languishing love,  has cried out in a sort of ecstasy:    \"I love you as no woman ever loved a man before!\"    When she says this she believes it. Her whole soul is aflame with the  ardor of emotion. It really seems to her that no one ever could have  loved so much as she.    This cry--spontaneous, untaught, sincere--has become almost one of  those conventionalities of amorous expression which belong to the  vocabulary of self-abandonment. Every woman who utters it, when torn by  the almost terrible extravagance of a great love, believes that no one  before her has ever said it, and that in her own case it is absolutely  true.    Yet, how many women are really faithful to the end? Very many, indeed,  if circumstances admit of easy faithfulness. A high-souled, generous,  ardent nature will endure an infinity of disillusionment, of  misfortune, of neglect, and even of ill treatment. Even so, the flame,  though it may sink low, can be revived again to burn as brightly as  before. But in order that this may be so it is necessary that the  object of such a wonderful devotion be alive, that he be present and  visible; or, if he be absent, that there should still exist some hope  of renewing the exquisite intimacy of the past.    A man who is sincerely loved may be compelled to take long journeys  which will separate him for an indefinite time from the woman who has  given her heart to him, and she will still be constant. He may be  imprisoned, perhaps for life, yet there is always the hope of his  release or of his escape; and some women will be faithful to him and  will watch for his return. But, given a situation which absolutely bars  out hope, which sunders two souls in such a way that they can never be  united in this world, and there we have a test so terribly severe that  few even of the most loyal and intensely clinging lovers can endure it.    Not that such a situation would lead a woman to turn to any other man  than the one to whom she had given her very life; but we might expect  that at least her strong desire would cool and weaken. She might  cherish his memory among the precious souvenirs of her love life; but  that she should still pour out the same rapturous, unstinted passion as  before seems almost too much to believe. The annals of emotion record  only one such instance; and so this instance has become known to all,  and has been cherished for nearly a thousand years. It involves the  story of a woman who did love, perhaps, as no one ever loved before or  since; for she was subjected to this cruel test, and she met the test  not alone completely, but triumphantly and almost fiercely.    The story is, of course, the story of Abelard and Heloise. It has many  times been falsely told. Portions of it have been omitted, and other  portions of it have been garbled. A whole literature has grown up  around the subject. It may well be worth our while to clear away the  ambiguities and the doubtful points, and once more to tell it simply,  without bias, and with a strict adherence to what seems to be the truth  attested by authentic records.    There is one circumstance connected with the story which we must  specially note. The narrative does something more than set forth the  one quite unimpeachable instance of unconquered constancy. It shows  how, in the last analysis, that which touches the human heart has more  vitality and more enduring interest than what concerns the intellect or  those achievements of the human mind which are external to our  emotional nature.    Pierre Abelard was undoubtedly the boldest and most creative reasoner  of his time. As a wandering teacher he drew after him thousands of  enthusiastic students. He gave a strong impetus to learning. He was a  marvelous logician and an accomplished orator. Among his pupils were  men who afterward became prelates of the church and distinguished  scholars. In the Dark Age, when the dictates of reason were almost  wholly disregarded, he fought fearlessly for intellectual freedom. He  was practically the founder of the University of Paris, which in turn  became the mother of medieval and modern universities.    He was, therefore, a great and striking figure in the history of  civilization. Nevertheless he would to-day be remembered only by  scholars and students of the Middle Ages were it not for the fact that  he inspired the most enduring love that history records. If Heloise had  never loved him, and if their story had not been so tragic and so  poignant, he would be to-day only a name known to but a few. His final  resting-place, in the cemetery of Pere Lachaise, in Paris, would not be  sought out by thousands every year and kept bright with flowers, the  gift of those who have themselves both loved and suffered.    Pierre Abelard--or, more fully, Pierre Abelard de Palais--was a native  of Brittany, born in the year 1079. His father was a knight, the lord  of the manor; but Abelard cared little for the life of a petty noble;  and so he gave up his seigniorial rights to his brothers and went forth  to become, first of all a student, and then a public lecturer and  teacher.    His student days ended abruptly in Paris, where he had enrolled himself  as the pupil of a distinguished philosopher, Guillaume de Champeaux;  but one day Abelard engaged in a disputation with his master. His  wonderful combination of eloquence, logic, and originality utterly  routed Champeaux, who was thus humiliated in the presence of his  disciples. He was the first of many enemies that Abelard was destined  to make in his long and stormy career. From that moment the young  Breton himself set up as a teacher of philosophy, and the brilliancy of  his discourses soon drew to him throngs of students from all over  Europe.    Before proceeding with the story of Abelard it is well to reconstruct,  however slightly, a picture of the times in which he lived. It was an  age when Western Europe was but partly civilized. Pedantry and learning  of the most minute sort existed side by side with the most violent  excesses of medieval barbarism. The Church had undertaken the gigantic  task of subduing and enlightening the semi-pagan peoples of France and  Germany and England.    When we look back at that period some will unjustly censure Rome for  not controlling more completely the savagery of the medievals. More  fairly should we wonder at the great measure of success which had  already been achieved. The leaven of a true Christianity was working in  the half-pagan populations. It had not yet completely reached the  nobles and the knights, or even all the ecclesiastics who served it and  who were consecrated to its mission. Thus, amid a sort of political  chaos were seen the glaring evils of feudalism. Kings and princes and  their followers lived the lives of swine. Private blood-feuds were  regarded lightly. There was as yet no single central power. Every man  carried his life in his hand, trusting to sword and dagger for  protection.    The cities were still mere hamlets clustered around great castles or  fortified cathedrals. In Paris itself the network of dark lanes, ill  lighted and unguarded, was the scene of midnight murder and  assassination.

At every turn she was with  him both day and night. With him she threw dice; with him she drank;  with him she hunted; and when he exercised himself in arms she was there  to admire and applaud.    At night the pair would disguise themselves as servants and wander about  the streets of Alexandria. In fact, more than once they were set upon in  the slums and treated roughly by the rabble who did not recognize them.  Cleopatra was always alluring, always tactful, often humorous, and full  of frolic.    Then came the shock of Antony's final breach with Octavian. Either  Antony or his rival must rule the world. Cleopatra's lover once more  became the Roman general, and with a great fleet proceeded to the coast  of Greece, where his enemy was encamped. Antony had raised a hundred and  twelve thousand troops and five hundred ships--a force far superior to  that commanded by Octavian. Cleopatra was there with sixty ships.    In the days that preceded the final battle much took place which still  remains obscure.
