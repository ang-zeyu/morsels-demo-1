To the Honourable    GEORGE LYTTLETON, ESQ;    One of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.    Sir,    Notwithstanding your constant refusal, when I have asked leave to  prefix your name to this dedication, I must still insist on my right  to desire your protection of this work.    To you, Sir, it is owing that this history was ever begun. It was by  your desire that I first thought of such a composition. So many years  have since past, that you may have, perhaps, forgotten this  circumstance: but your desires are to me in the nature of commands;  and the impression of them is never to be erased from my memory.    Again, Sir, without your assistance this history had never been  completed. Be not startled at the assertion. I do not intend to draw  on you the suspicion of being a romance writer. I mean no more than  that I partly owe to you my existence during great part of the time  which I have employed in composing it: another matter which it may be  necessary to remind you of; since there are certain actions of which  you are apt to be extremely forgetful; but of these I hope I shall  always have a better memory than yourself.    Lastly, It is owing to you that the history appears what it now is. If  there be in this work, as some have been pleased to say, a stronger  picture of a truly benevolent mind than is to be found in any other,  who that knows you, and a particular acquaintance of yours, will doubt  whence that benevolence hath been copied? The world will not, I  believe, make me the compliment of thinking I took it from myself. I  care not: this they shall own, that the two persons from whom I have  taken it, that is to say, two of the best and worthiest men in the  world, are strongly and zealously my friends. I might be contented  with this, and yet my vanity will add a third to the number; and him  one of the greatest and noblest, not only in his rank, but in every  public and private virtue. But here, whilst my gratitude for the  princely benefactions of the Duke of Bedford bursts from my heart, you  must forgive my reminding you that it was you who first recommended me  to the notice of my benefactor.    And what are your objections to the allowance of the honour which I  have sollicited? Why, you have commended the book so warmly, that you  should be ashamed of reading your name before the dedication. Indeed,  sir, if the book itself doth not make you ashamed of your  commendations, nothing that I can here write will, or ought. I am not  to give up my right to your protection and patronage, because you have  commended my book: for though I acknowledge so many obligations to  you, I do not add this to the number; in which friendship, I am  convinced, hath so little share: since that can neither biass your  judgment, nor pervert your integrity. An enemy may at any time obtain  your commendation by only deserving it; and the utmost which the  faults of your friends can hope for, is your silence; or, perhaps, if  too severely accused, your gentle palliation.    In short, sir, I suspect, that your dislike of public praise is your  true objection to granting my request. I have observed that you have,  in common with my two other friends, an unwillingness to hear the  least mention of your own virtues; that, as a great poet says of one  of you, (he might justly have said it of all three), you         _Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame_.    If men of this disposition are as careful to shun applause, as others  are to escape censure, how just must be your apprehension of your  character falling into my hands; since what would not a man have  reason to dread, if attacked by an author who had received from him  injuries equal to my obligations to you!    And will not this dread of censure increase in proportion to the  matter which a man is conscious of having afforded for it? If his  whole life, for instance, should have been one continued subject of  satire, he may well tremble when an incensed satirist takes him in  hand. Now, sir, if we apply this to your modest aversion to panegyric,  how reasonable will your fears of me appear!    Yet surely you might have gratified my ambition, from this single  confidence, that I shall always prefer the indulgence of your  inclinations to the satisfaction of my own. A very strong instance of  which I shall give you in this address, in which I am determined to  follow the example of all other dedicators, and will consider not what  my patron really deserves to have written, but what he will be best  pleased to read.    Without further preface then, I here present you with the labours of  some years of my life. What merit these labours have is already known  to yourself. If, from your favourable judgment, I have conceived some  esteem for them, it cannot be imputed to vanity; since I should have  agreed as implicitly to your opinion, had it been given in favour of  any other man's production. Negatively, at least, I may be allowed to  say, that had I been sensible of any great demerit in the work, you  are the last person to whose protection I would have ventured to  recommend it.    From the name of my patron, indeed, I hope my reader will be  convinced, at his very entrance on this work, that he will find in the  whole course of it nothing prejudicial to the cause of religion and  virtue, nothing inconsistent with the strictest rules of decency, nor  which can offend even the chastest eye in the perusal. On the  contrary, I declare, that to recommend goodness and innocence hath  been my sincere endeavour in this history. This honest purpose you  have been pleased to think I have attained: and to say the truth, it  is likeliest to be attained in books of this kind; for an example is a  kind of picture, in which virtue becomes, as it were, an object of  sight, and strikes us with an idea of that loveliness, which Plato  asserts there is in her naked charms.    Besides displaying that beauty of virtue which may attract the  admiration of mankind, I have attempted to engage a stronger motive to  human action in her favour, by convincing men, that their true  interest directs them to a pursuit of her. For this purpose I have  shown that no acquisitions of guilt can compensate the loss of that  solid inward comfort of mind, which is the sure companion of innocence  and virtue; nor can in the least balance the evil of that horror and  anxiety which, in their room, guilt introduces into our bosoms. And  again, that as these acquisitions are in themselves generally  worthless, so are the means to attain them not only base and infamous,  but at best incertain, and always full of danger. Lastly, I have  endeavoured strongly to inculcate, that virtue and innocence can  scarce ever be injured but by indiscretion; and that it is this alone  which often betrays them into the snares that deceit and villainy  spread for them. A moral which I have the more industriously laboured,  as the teaching it is, of all others, the likeliest to be attended  with success; since, I believe, it is much easier to make good men  wise, than to make bad men good.    For these purposes I have employed all the wit and humour of which I  am master in the following history; wherein I have endeavoured to  laugh mankind out of their favourite follies and vices. How far I have  succeeded in this good attempt, I shall submit to the candid"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6603"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage : 600-1776 King Aethelbert - King George III (#3)"],[1,"and  threw it into a ridge alongside the furrow dug by the plough  blade. This plough was too heavy for two oxen and was pulled by a  team of about eight to ten oxen. Each ox was owned by a different  man as was the plough, because no one peasant could afford the  complete set. Each freeman was allotted certain strips in each  field to bear crops. His strips were far from each other, which  insured some very fertile and some only fair soil, and some land  near his village dwelling and some far away. These strips he  cultivated, sowed with seed, and harvested for himself and his  family. After the harvest, they reverted to common ownership for  grazing by pigs, sheep, and geese. As soon as haymaking was over,  the meadows became common grazingland for horses, cows, and oxen.  Not just any inhabitant, but usually only those who owned a piece  of land in the parish were entitled to graze their animals on the  common land, and each owner had this right of pasture for a  definite number of animals. The faster horse replaced the ox as  the primary work animal. Other farm implements were: coulters,  which gave free passage to the plough by cutting weeds and turf,  picks, spades and shovels, reaping hooks and scythes, and sledge  hammers and anvils. Strips of land for agriculture were added from  waste land as the community grew. Waste lands were moors bristling  with brushwood, or gorse, heather and wanton weeds, reed-coated  marshes, quaking peat-bogs, or woods grown haphazard on sand or  rock. With iron axes, forests could be cleared to provide more  arable land.    Some villages had a smith, a wheelwright, and a cooper. There were  villages which had one or two market days in each week. Cattle,  sheep, pigs, poultry, calves, and hare were sold there. London was  a town on the Thames River under the protection of the Celtic  river god Lud: Lud's town. It's huts were probably built over the  water, as was Celtic custom. It was a port for foreign trade. Near  the town was Ludhill.    Flint workers mined with deer antler picks and ox shoulder blade  shovels for flint to grind into axes, spearheads, and arrowheads.  Mine shafts were up to thirty feet deep and necessitated the use  of chalk lamps fuelled by animal fat with wicks of moss. The flint  was hauled up in baskets.    Common men and women were now buried in tombs within memorial  burial mounds of earth with stone entrances and interior chambers.  A man's weapons and shield were buried with him and a woman's  spindle and weaving baton, and perhaps beads or pottery with her.  At times, mounds of earth would simply be covered over piles of  corpses and ashes in urns. In these mass graves, some corpses had  spear holes or sword cuts, indicating death by violence. The Druid  priests, the learned class of the Celts, taught the Celts to  believe in reincarnation of the soul after death of one body into  another body. They also threw prized possessions into lakes and  rivers as sacrifices to water gods. They placed images of gods and  goddesses in shrines, which were sometimes large enough to be  temples.    With the ability to grow food and the acquisition of land by  conquest by invading groups, the population grew. There were  different classes of men. The freemen were eorls [noble freemen]  or ceorls [ordinary free farmers]. Slaves were not free. Freemen  had long hair and beards. Slaves' hair was shorn from their heads  so that they were bald. Slaves were chained and often traded.  Prisoners taken in battle, especially native Britons taken by  invading groups, became slaves. A slave who was captured or  purchased was a \"theow\". An \"esne\" was a slave who worked for  hire. A \"weallas\" was a Welsh slave. Criminals became slaves of  the person wronged or of the king. Sometimes a father pressed by  need sold his children or his wife into bondage. Debtors, who  increased in number during famine, which occurred regularly,  became slaves by giving up the freeman's sword and spear, picking  up a slave's mattock [pick ax for the soils], and placing their  head within a lord's or lady's hands. They were called wite-  theows. The original meaning of the word lord was \"loaf-giver\".  Children with a slave parent were slaves. The slaves lived in huts  around the homes of big landholders, which were made of logs and  consisted on one large room or hall. An open hearth was in the  middle of the earthen floor of the hall, which was strewn with  rushes. There was a hole in the roof to let out the smoke. Here  the landholder and his men would eat meat, bread, salt, hot spiced  ale, and mead while listening to minstrels sing about the heroic  deeds of their ancestors. Richer men drank wine. There were  festivals which lasted several days, in which warriors feasted,  drank, gambled, boasted, and slept where they fell. Physical  strength and endurance in adversity were admired traits.    Slaves often were used as grain grinders, ploughmen, sowers,  haywards, woodwards, shepherds, goatherds, swineherds, oxherds,  cowherds, dairymaids, and barnmen. Slaves had no legal rights. A  lord could kill his slave at will. A wrong done to a slave was  regarded as done to his owner. If a person killed another man's  slave, he had to compensate him with the slave's purchase price.  The slave owner had to answer for the offences of his slaves  against others, as for the mischief done by his cattle. Since a  slave had no property, he could not be fined for crimes, but was  whipped, mutilated, or killed.    During famine, acorns, beans, peas, and even bark were ground down  to supplement flour when grain stocks grew low. People scoured the  hedgerows for herbs, roots, nettles, and wild grasses, which were  usually left for the pigs. Sometimes people were driven to  infanticide or group suicide by jumping together off a cliff or  into the water.    Several large kingdoms came to replace the many small ones. The  people were worshipping pagan gods when St. Augustine came to  England in 596 A.D. to Christianize them. King AEthelbert of Kent  [much later a county] and his wife, who had been raised Christian  on the continent, met him when he arrived. The King gave him land  where there were ruins of an old city. Augustine used stones from  the ruins to build a church which was later called Canterbury. He  also built the first St. Paul's church in London. Aethelbert and  his men who fought with him and ate and lived in his household  [gesiths] became Christian. A succession of princesses went out  from Kent to marry other Saxon kings and convert them to  Christianity.    Augustine knew how to write, but King AEthelbert did not. The King  announced his laws at meetings of his people and his eorls would  decide the punishments. There was a fine of 120s. for disregarding  a command of the King. He and Augustine decided to write down some  of these laws, which now included the King's new law concerning  the church.    These laws concern personal injury, killing, theft, burglary,  marriage, adultery, and inheritance. The blood feud's private  revenge for killing had been replaced by payment of compensation  to the dead man's kindred. One paid a man's \"wergeld\" [worth] to  his kindred for causing his wrongful death. The wergeld [wer] of a  king was an unpayable amount of about 7000s., of an aetheling [a  king-worthy man of the extended royal family] was 1500s., of an  eorl, 300s., of a ceorl, 100s., of a laet [agricultural worker in  Kent, which class was between free and slave], 40-80s., and of a  slave nothing. At this time a shilling could buy a cow in Kent or  a sheep elsewhere. If a ceorl killed an eorl, he paid three times  as much as an eorl would have paid as murderer. The penalty for  slander was tearing out of the tongue. If an aetheling was guilty  of this offense, his tongue was worth five times that of a coerl,  so he had to pay proportionately more to ransom it. The crimes of  murder, treachery to one's own lord, arson, house breaking, and  open theft, were punishable by death and forfeiture of all  property.                                      - The Law -    \"THESE ARE THE DOOMS [DECREES] WHICH KING AETHELBERHT ESTABLISHED  IN THE DAYS OF AUGUSTINE     1. [Theft of] the property of God and of the church [shall be      compensated], twelve fold; a bishop's property, eleven fold; a      priest's property, nine fold; a deacon's property, six fold; a      cleric's property, three fold; church frith [breach of the peace      of the church; right of sanctuary and protection given to those      within its precincts], two fold [that of ordinary breach of the      public peace]; m....frith [breach of the peace of a meeting      place], two fold.     2.
