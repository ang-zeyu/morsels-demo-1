The caravansary into which Haschim and his following now turned off  stood on a plot of rising ground surrounded by palm-trees. Before the  destruction of the heathen sanctuaries it had been a temple of Imhotep,  the Egyptian Esculapius, the beneficient god of healing, who had had  his places of special worship even in the city of the dead. It was half  relined, half buried in desert sand when an enterprising inn-keeper had  bought the elegant structure with the adjacent grove for a very moderate  sum. Since then it had passed to various owners, a large wooden building  for the accommodation of travellers had been added to the massive  edifice, and among the palm-trees, which extended as far as the  ill-repaired quay, stables were erected and plots of ground fenced in  for beasts of all kinds. The whole place looked like a cattle-fair, and  indeed it was a great resort of the butchers and horse-dealers of the  town, who came there to purchase. The palm-grove, being one of the  few remaining close to the city, also served the Memphites as a  pleasure-ground where they could \"sniff fresh air\" and treat themselves  in a pleasant shade. 'Tables and seats had been set out close to the  river, and there were boats on hire in mine host's little creek; and  those who took their pleasure in coming thither by water were glad to  put in and refresh themselves under the palms of Nesptah.    Two rows of houses had formerly divided this rendezvous for the sober  and the reckless from the highroad, but they had long since been pulled  down and laid level with the ground by successive landlords. Even now  some hundreds of laborers might be seen, in spite of the scorching heat,  toiling under Arab overseers to demolish a vast ruin of the date of the  Ptolemies and transporting the huge blocks of limestone and marble, and  the numberless columns which once had supported the roof of the temple  of Zeus, to the eastern shore of the Nile-loading them on to trucks  drawn by oxen which hauled them down to the quay to cross the river in  flat-bottomed boats.    Amru, the Khaliff's general and representative, was there building his  new capital. For this the temples of the old gods were used as quarries,  and they supplied not only finely-squared blocks of the most durable  stone, but also myriads of Greek columns of every order, which had only  to be ferried over and set up again on the other shore; for the Arabs  disdained nothing in the way of materials, and made indiscriminate use  of blocks and pillars in their own sanctuaries, whether they took them  from heathen temples or Christian churches.    The walls of the temple of Imhotep had originally been completely  covered with pictures of the gods, and hieroglyphic inscriptions; but  the smoke of reeking hearths had long since blackened them, fanatical  hands had never been wanting to deface them, and in many places they had  been lime-washed and scrawled with Christian symbols or very unchristian  mottoes, in Greek and the spoken dialect of the Egyptians. The Arab  and his men took their meal in what had been the great hall of the  temple--none of them drinking wine excepting the captain of the caravan,  who was no Moslem but belonged to the Parsee sect of the Masdakites.    When the old merchant, sitting at a table by himself, had satisfied his  hunger, he called this chief and desired him to load the bale containing  the hanging on a litter between the two largest baggage camels, and to  fasten it securely but so that it could easily be removed.    \"It is done,\" replied the Persian, as he wiped his thick moustache--he  was a magnificent man as tall and stalwart as an oak, with light flowing  hair like a lion's mane.    \"So much the better,\" said Haschim. \"Then come out with me.\" And he led  the way to the palmgrove.    The sun had sunk to rest behind the pyramids, the Necropolis, and the  Libyan hills; the eastern sky, and the bare limestone rock of Babylon on  the opposite shore were shining with hues of indescribable diversity and  beauty. It seemed as though every variety of rose reared by the skilled  gardeners of Arsinoe or Naukratis had yielded its hues, from golden buff  to crimson and the deepest wine-tinted violet, to shed their magic glow  on the plains, the peaks and gorges of the hills, with the swiftness of  thought.    The old man's heart beat high as he gazed at the scene; he drew a deep  breath, and laying his slender hand on the Persian's mighty arm he said:  \"Your prophet, Masdak, taught that it was God's will that no one should  think himself more or less chosen than another, and that there should be  neither rich nor poor on earth, but that every possession should belong  to all in common. Well, look around you here as I do. The man who has  not seen this has seen nothing. There is no fairer scene here below and  to whom does it belong? To poor simple Salech yonder, whom we allowed to  tramp half naked at our camels' heels out of pity.--It is his as much  as it is yours or mine or the Khaliff's. God has given us all an equal  share in the glory of his works, as your prophet would have it. How much  beauty is the common possession of our race! Let us be thankful for it,  Rustem, for indeed it is no small matter.--But as to property, such as  man may win or lose, that is quite a different matter. We all start on  the same race-course, and what you Masdakites ask is that lead should  be tied to the feet of the swift so that no one should outstrip another;  but that would be.... Well, well! Let us feast our eyes now on the  marvellous beauty before us. Look: What just now was the purple of this  flower is now deep ruby red; what before was a violet gleam now is the  richest amethyst. Do you see the golden fringe to those clouds? It is  like a setting.--And all this is ours--is yours and mine--so long as we  have eyes and heart to enjoy and be uplifted by it!\"    The Masdakite laughed, a fresh, sonorous laugh, and said: \"Yes, Master,  for those who see as you see. The colors are bright no doubt over the  sky and the hills, and we do not often see such a red as that at home in  my country; but of what use is all that magic show? You see rubies and  amethysts--but as for me! The gems in your hanging stand for something  more than that shining show. I mean no harm, Master, but I would give  all the sunsets that ever glowed on earth for your bales and never  repent of the bargain!\" He laughed more heartily than before and added:  \"But you, worthy Father, would think twice before you signed it.--As to  what we Masdakites hope for, our time is not yet come.\"    \"And suppose it were, and that the hanging were yours?\"    \"I should sell it and add the price to my savings, and go home and buy  some land, and take a pretty wife, and breed camels and horses.\"    \"And next day would come the poorer men who had laid nothing by, and  had made no bargain over hangings and sunsets; and they would ask for  a share of your land, and a camel and a foal each, and you would not  be able ever to see a sunset again but must wander about the world, and  your pretty wife with you to help you share everything with others.--Let  us abide by the old order, my Rustem, and may the Most High preserve you  your good heart, for you have but a foolish and crotchety head.\"    The big man bent over his master and gratefully kissed his arm; at this  moment the guide rejoined them, but with a long face for he had promised  more than he could perform. The Mukaukas George had set out--a quite  unheard of event--for an excursion on the river in his barge, with  his son and the ladies of the house just as he was hoping to secure an  audience for the Arab. Orion's return--the steward had explained--had  made the old man quite young again. Haschim must now wait till the  morrow, and he, the guide, would counsel him to pass the night in the  city at an inn kept by one Moschion, where he would be well cared for.    But the merchant preferred to remain where he was. He did not care  about the delay, more particularly as he wished to consult an Egyptian  physician with regard to an old standing complaint he suffered from,  and there was no more skilful or learned leech in the whole land, the  Egyptian guide assured him, than the famous Philip of Memphis. The  situation here, outside the town, was very pleasant, and from the  river's bank he might observe the comet which had been visible for some  nights past--a portent of evil no doubt. The natives of the city  had been paralysed with terror; that indeed was evident even here in  Nesptah's caravansary, for usually as the evening grew cool, the tables  and benches under the palms were crowded with guests; but who would care  to think of enjoyment in those days of dread?    So he remounted his ass to fetch the physician, while old Haschim,  leaning on the Masdakite's arm, betook himself to a bench by the river.  There he sat gazing thoughtfully at the starry sky, and his companion  dreamed of home and of buying a meadow, even without the price of the  gorgeous hanging, of building a house, and of choosing a pretty little  wife to manage it. Should she be fair or dark? He would rather she  should be fair.    But his castle in the air was shattered at this point, for an object was  approaching across the Nile which attracted his attention, and which he  pointed out to his chief. The stream lay before them like a broad belt  of black and silver brocade. The waxing moon was mirrored in the almost  unruffled surface and where a ripple curled it the tiny crest glittered  like white flame. Bats swooped to and fro in the gloom from the city of  the dead to the river, and flitted above it like shadows blown about by  the wind. A few lateen sails moved like pale, gigantic birds over the  dark waters; but now from the north--and from the city--a larger mass  came towards the palm-grove with bright, gleaming eyes of light.    \"A fine boat,--the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/560"],[0,"Mr. Standfast (#3)"],[1,"what a  precious thing this little England was, how old and kindly and  comforting, how wholly worth striving for. The freedom of an acre of  her soil was cheaply bought by the blood of the best of us. I knew what  it meant to be a poet, though for the life of me I could not have made  a line of verse. For in that hour I had a prospect as if from a hilltop  which made all the present troubles of the road seem of no account. I  saw not only victory after war, but a new and happier world after  victory, when I should inherit something of this English peace and wrap  myself in it till the end of my days.    Very humbly and quietly, like a man walking through a cathedral, I went  down the hill to the Manor lodge, and came to a door in an old  red-brick facade, smothered in magnolias which smelt like hot lemons in  the June dusk. The car from the inn had brought on my baggage, and  presently I was dressing in a room which looked out on a water-garden.  For the first time for more than a year I put on a starched shirt and a  dinner-jacket, and as I dressed I could have sung from pure  lightheartedness. I was in for some arduous job, and sometime that  evening in that place I should get my marching orders. Someone would  arrive--perhaps Bullivant--and read me the riddle. But whatever it was,  I was ready for it, for my whole being had found a new purpose. Living  in the trenches, you are apt to get your horizon narrowed down to the  front line of enemy barbed wire on one side and the nearest rest  billets on the other. But now I seemed to see beyond the fog to a happy  country.    High-pitched voices greeted my ears as I came down the broad staircase,  voices which scarcely accorded with the panelled walls and the austere  family portraits; and when I found my hostesses in the hall I thought  their looks still less in keeping with the house. Both ladies were on  the wrong side of forty, but their dress was that of young girls. Miss  Doria Wymondham was tall and thin with a mass of nondescript pale hair  confined by a black velvet fillet. Miss Claire Wymondham was shorter  and plumper and had done her best by ill-applied cosmetics to make  herself look like a foreign _demi-mondaine_. They greeted me with the  friendly casualness which I had long ago discovered was the right  English manner towards your guests; as if they had just strolled in and  billeted themselves, and you were quite glad to see them but mustn't be  asked to trouble yourself further. The next second they were cooing  like pigeons round a picture which a young man was holding up in the  lamplight.    He was a tallish, lean fellow of round about thirty years, wearing grey  flannels and shoes dusty from the country roads. His thin face was  sallow as if from living indoors, and he had rather more hair on his  head than most of us. In the glow of the lamp his features were very  clear, and I examined them with interest, for, remember, I was  expecting a stranger to give me orders. He had a long, rather strong  chin and an obstinate mouth with peevish lines about its corners. But  the remarkable feature was his eyes. I can best describe them by saying  that they looked hot--not fierce or angry, but so restless that they  seemed to ache physically and to want sponging with cold water.    They finished their talk about the picture--which was couched in a  jargon of which I did not understand one word--and Miss Doria turned to  me and the young man.    'My cousin Launcelot Wake--Mr Brand.'    We nodded stiffly and Mr Wake's hand went up to smooth his hair in a  self-conscious gesture.    'Has Barnard announced dinner? By the way, where is Mary?'    'She came in five minutes ago and I sent her to change,' said Miss  Claire. 'I won't have her spoiling the evening with that horrid  uniform. She may masquerade as she likes out-of-doors, but this house  is for civilized people.'    The butler appeared and mumbled something. 'Come along,' cried Miss  Doria, 'for I'm sure you are starving, Mr Brand. And Launcelot has  bicycled ten miles.'    The dining-room was very unlike the hall. The panelling had been  stripped off, and the walls and ceiling were covered with a dead-black  satiny paper on which hung the most monstrous pictures in large  dull-gold frames. I could only see them dimly, but they seemed to be a  mere riot of ugly colour. The young man nodded towards them. 'I see you  have got the Degousses hung at last,' he said.    'How exquisite they are!' cried Miss Claire. 'How subtle and candid and  brave! Doria and I warm our souls at their flame.'    Some aromatic wood had been burned in the room, and there was a queer  sickly scent about. Everything in that place was strained and uneasy  and abnormal--the candle shades on the table, the mass of faked china  fruit in the centre dish, the gaudy hangings and the nightmarish walls.  But the food was magnificent. It was the best dinner I had eaten since  1914.    'Tell me, Mr Brand,' said Miss Doria, her long white face propped on a  much-beringed hand. 'You are one of us? You are in revolt against this  crazy war?'    'Why, yes,' I said, remembering my part. 'I think a little common-sense  would settle it right away.'    'With a little common-sense it would never have started,' said Mr Wake.    'Launcelot's a C.O., you know,' said Miss Doria.    I did not know, for he did not look any kind of soldier ... I was just  about to ask him what he commanded, when I remembered that the letters  stood also for 'Conscientious Objector,' and stopped in time.    At that moment someone slipped into the vacant seat on my right hand. I  turned and saw the V.A.D. girl who had brought tea to Blaikie that  afternoon at the hospital.    'He was exempted by his Department,' the lady went on, 'for he's a  Civil Servant, and so he never had a chance of testifying in court, but  no one has done better work for our cause. He is on the committee of  the L.D.A., and questions have been asked about him in Parliament.'    The man was not quite comfortable at this biography. He glanced  nervously at me and was going to begin some kind of explanation, when  Miss Doria cut him short. 'Remember our rule, Launcelot. No turgid war  controversy within these walls.'    I agreed with her. The war had seemed closely knit to the Summer  landscape for all its peace, and to the noble old chambers of the  Manor. But in that demented modish dining-room it was shriekingly  incongruous.    Then they spoke of other things. Mostly of pictures or common friends,  and a little of books. They paid no heed to me, which was fortunate,  for I know nothing about these matters and didn't understand half the  language. But once Miss Doria tried to bring me in. They were talking  about some Russian novel--a name like Leprous Souls--and she asked me  if I had read it. By a curious chance I had. It had drifted somehow  into our dug-out on the Scarpe, and after we had all stuck in the  second chapter it had disappeared in the mud to which it naturally  belonged. The lady praised its 'poignancy' and 'grave beauty'. I  assented and congratulated myself on my second escape--for if the  question had been put to me I should have described it as God-forgotten  twaddle.    I turned to the girl, who welcomed me with a smile. I had thought her  pretty in her V.A.D. dress, but now, in a filmy black gown and with her  hair no longer hidden by a cap, she was the most ravishing thing you  ever saw. And I observed something else. There was more than good looks  in her young face. Her broad, low brow and her laughing eyes were  amazingly intelligent. She had an uncanny power of making her eyes go  suddenly grave and deep, like a glittering river narrowing into a pool.    'We shall never be introduced,' she said, 'so let me reveal myself. I'm  Mary Lamington and these are my aunts ... Did you really like Leprous  Souls?'    It was easy enough to talk to her. And oddly enough her mere presence  took away the oppression I had felt in that room. For she belonged to  the out-of-doors and to the old house and to the world at large. She  belonged to the war, and to that happier world beyond it--a world which  must be won by going through the struggle and not by shirking it, like  those two silly ladies.    I could see Wake's eyes often on the girl, while he boomed and  oraculated and the Misses Wymondham prattled. Presently the  conversation seemed to leave the flowery paths of art and to verge  perilously near forbidden topics. He began to abuse our generals in the  field. I could not choose but listen. Miss Lamington's brows were  slightly bent, as if in disapproval, and my own temper began to rise.    He had every kind of idiotic criticism--incompetence,  faint-heartedness, corruption. Where he got the stuff I can't imagine,  for the most grousing Tommy, with his leave stopped, never put together  such balderdash. Worst of all he asked me to agree with him.    It took all my sense of discipline. 'I don't know much about the  subject,' I said, 'but out in South Africa I did hear that the British  leading was the weak point. I expect there's a good deal in what you  say.'    It may have been fancy, but the girl at my side seemed to whisper 'Well  done!'    Wake and I did not remain long behind before joining the ladies; I  purposely cut it short, for I was in mortal fear lest I should lose my  temper and spoil everything. I stood up with my back against the  mantelpiece for as long as a man may smoke a cigarette, and I let him  yarn to me, while I looked steadily at his face. By this time I was  very clear that Wake was not the fellow to give me my instructions. He  wasn't playing a game. He was a perfectly honest crank, but not a  fanatic, for he wasn't sure of himself. He had somehow lost his  self-respect and was trying to argue himself back into it. He had  considerable brains, for the reasons he gave for differing from most of  his countrymen were good so far as they went. I"]]]
