If successful  in gaining this prize they were not long in disposing of it, cooking  evidently being considered a waste of time. A famished \"black-fellow\"  after a heavy meal used to remind me of pictures of the boa-constrictor  who has swallowed an ox, and is resting in satisfied peace to gorge.    The appeal of \"Gib it damper\" or \"Gib it gabbi\" (water), was seldom made  in vain, and hardly a day passed but what one was visited by these silent,  starving shadows. In appreciation no doubt of the kindness shown them,  some of the tribe volunteered to find \"gabbi\" for the white-fellow in the  roots of a certain gum-tree. Their offer was accepted, and soon a band of  unhappy-looking miners was seen returning. In their hands they carried  short pieces of the root, which they sucked vigorously; some got a little  moisture, and some did not, but however unequal their success in this  respect they were all alike in another, for every man vomited freely. This  means of obtaining a water supply never became popular. No doubt a little  moisture can be coaxed from the roots of certain gums, but it would seem  that it needs the stomach of a black-fellow to derive any benefit from it.    Though I cannot say that I studied the manners and customs of the  aboriginals at that time, the description, none the worse for being old,  given to savages of another land would fit them admirably--\"Manners none,  customs beastly.\"          CHAPTER II        \"HARD UP\"      During that drought-stricken Christmas-time my mate was down at the  \"Cross,\" trying to carry through some business by which our coffers might  be replenished; for work how we would on alluvial or quartz reefs, no gold  could we find. That we worked with a will, the remark made to me by an old  fossicker will go to show. After watching me \"belting away\" at a solid  mass of quartz for some time without speaking, \"Which,\" said he, \"is the  hammer-headed end of your pick?\" Then shaking his head, \"Ah! I could guess  you were a Scotchman--brute force and blind ignorance!\" He then proceeded  to show me how to do twice the amount of work at half the expenditure of  labour. I never remember a real digger who was not ready to help one, both  with advice and in practice, and I never experienced that \"greening\" of  new chums which is a prominent feature of most novels that deal with  Australian life.    In the absence of Lord Douglas, an old horse-artilleryman, Richardson by  name, was my usual comrade. A splendid fellow he was too, and one of the  few to be rewarded for his dogged perseverance and work. In a pitiable  state the poor man was when first we met, half dead from dysentery, camped  all alone under a sheet of coarse calico. Emaciated from sickness, he was  unable to follow his horses, which had wandered in search of food and  water, though they constituted his only earthly possession. How he, and  many another I could mention, survived, I cannot think. But if a man  declines to die, and fights for life, he is hard to kill!    Amongst the prospectors it was customary for one mate to look after the  horses, and pack water to the others who worked. These men, of course,  knew several sources unknown to the general public. It was from one of  them that we learnt of the existence of a small soak some thirteen miles  from Coolgardie. Seeing no hope of rain, and no prospect of being able to  stop longer at Coolgardie, Mr. Davies, who camped near us, and I, decided  to make our way to this soak, and wait for better or worse times. Taking  the only horse which remained to us, and what few provisions we had, we  changed our residence from the dust-swept flats of Coolgardie to the  silent bush, where we set up a little hut of boughs, and awaited the  course of events. Sheltered from the sun's burning rays by our house, so  low that it could only be entered on hands and knees, for we had neither  time nor strength to build a spacious structure, and buoyed up by the  entrancement of reading \"The Adventures of a Lady's Maid,\" kindly lent by  a fellow-digger, we did our best to spend a \"Happy Christmas.\"    Somehow, the climate and surroundings seemed singularly inappropriate;  dust could not be transformed, even in imagination, into snow, nor heat  into frost, any more easily than we could turn dried apples into roast  beef and plum-pudding. Excellent food as dried fruit is, yet it is apt  to become monotonous when it must do duty for breakfast, dinner, and tea!  Such was our scanty fare; nevertheless we managed to keen up the  appearance of being quite festive and happy.    Having spread the table--that is, swept the floor clear of ants and other  homely insects--and laid out the feast, I rose to my knees and proposed  the health of my old friend and comrade Mr. Davies, wished him the  compliments of the season, and expressed a hope that we should never spend  a worse Christmas. The toast was received with cheers and honoured in weak  tea, brewed from the re-dried leaves of our last night's meal. He suitably  replied, and cordially endorsed my last sentiment. After duly honouring  the toasts of \"The Ladies,\" \"Absent Friends,\" and others befitting the  occasion, we fell to on the frugal feast.    For the benefit of thrifty housewives, as well as those whom poverty has  stricken, I respectfully recommend the following recipe. For dried apples:  Take a handful, chew slightly, swallow, fill up with warm water and wait.  Before long a feeling both grateful and comforting, as having dined not  wisely but too heavily, will steal over you. Repeat the dose for luncheon  and tea.    One or two other men were camped near us, and I have no doubt would have  willingly added to our slender store had they known to what short commons  we were reduced. Our discomforts were soon over, however, for Lord Douglas  hearing that I was in a starving condition, hastened from the \"Cross,\" not  heeding the terrible accounts of the track, bringing with him a supply of  the staple food of the country, \"Tinned Dog\"--as canned provisions are  designated.    Wandering on from our little rock of refuge, we landed at the Twenty-five  Mile, where lately a rich reef had been found. We pegged out a claim on  which we worked, camped under the shade of a \"Kurrajong\" tree, close above  a large granite rock on which we depended for our water; and here we spent  several months busy on our reef, during which time Lord Douglas went home  to England, with financial schemes in his head, leaving Mr. Davies and  myself to hold the property and work as well as we could manage and I  fancy that for a couple of amateurs we did a considerable amount of  development.    Here we lived almost alone, with the exception of another small party  working the adjoining mine, occasionally visited by a prospector with  horses to water. Though glad of their company, it was not with unmixed  feelings that we viewed their arrival, for it took us all our time to get  sufficient water for ourselves. I well remember one occasion on which,  after a slight shower of rain, we, having no tank, scooped up the water we  could from the shallow holes, even using a sponge, such was our eagerness  not to waste a single drop; the water thus collected was emptied into a  large rock-hole, which we covered with flat stones. We then went to our  daily work on the reef, congratulating ourselves on the nice little  \"plant\" of water. Imagine our disgust, on returning in the evening, at  finding a mob of thirsty packhorses being watered from our precious  supply! There was nothing to be done but to pretend we liked it. The  water being on the rock was of course free to all.    How I used to envy those horsemen, and longed for the time when I could  afford horses or camels of my own, to go away back into the bush and just  see what was there. Many a day I spent poring over the map of the Colony,  longing and longing to push out into the vast blank spaces of the unknown.  Even at that time I planned out the expedition which at last I was enabled  to undertake, though all was very visionary, and I could hardly conceive  how I should ever manage to find the necessary ways and means.    Nearly every week I would ride into Coolgardie for stores, and walk out  again leading the loaded packhorse, our faithful little chestnut \"brumby,\"  i.e., half-wild pony, of which there are large herds running in the bush  near the settled parts of the coast. A splendid little fellow this, a true  type of his breed, fit for any amount of work and hardship. As often as  not he would do his journey into Coolgardie (twenty-five miles), be tied  up all night without a feed or drink--or as long as I had to spend there  on business--and return again loaded next morning. Chaff and oats were  then almost unprocurable, and however kind-hearted he might be, a poor  man could hardly afford a shilling a gallon to water his horse. On these  occasions I made my quarters at Bayley's mine, where a good solid meal and  the pleasant company of Messrs. Browne and Lyon always awaited me. Several  times in their generosity these good fellows spared a gallon or two of  precious water for the old pony.    They have a funny custom in the West of naming horses after their  owners--thus the chestnut is known to this day as \"Little Carnegie.\"  Sometimes they are named after the men from whom they are bought. This  practice, when coach-horses are concerned, has its laughable side, and  passengers unacquainted with the custom may be astonished to hear all  sorts of oaths and curses, or words of entreaty and encouragement,  addressed to some well-known name--and they might be excused for thinking  the driver's mind was a little unhinged, or that in his troubles and  vexations he was calling on some prominent citizen, in the same way that  knights of old invoked their saints.    Thus, our peaceful life at the \"Twenty-five\" passed on, relieved sometimes  by the arrival of horsemen and others in search of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4985"],[0,"Ruth Fielding of the Red Mill; Or, Jasper Parloe's Secret (#3)"],[1,"Parloe trailing on behind, and with lanterns and a stretcher, Reno  would not budge. The man called him, but he looked up at Ruth and did  not move from her side.    \"I declare for't,\" exclaimed one man. \"That girl will have to go with  us, Doctor Davison. You see what the dog means to do.\"    Ruth spoke to the mastiff, commanded him to leave her and find \"Tom.\"  But although the dog looked at her intelligently enough, and barked  his response--a deep, sudden, explosive bark--he refused to start  without her.    \"It's a long way for the girl,\" objected Doctor Davison. \"Besides, she  is waiting to meet her uncle.\"    \"I am not tired,\" she told him, quickly. \"Remember I've been sitting  all the afternoon. And perhaps every minute is precious. We don't know  how badly the dog's master may be hurt. I'll go. I'm sure I can keep  up with you.\"    Reno seemed to understand her words perfectly, and uttered another  short, sharp bark.    \"Let us go, then,\" said Doctor Davison, hurriedly.    So the men picked up their lanterns and the stretcher again. They  crossed the tracks and came to a street that soon became a country  road. Cheslow did not spread itself very far in this direction. Doctor  Davison explained to Ruth that the settlement had begun to grow in the  parts beyond the railroad and that all this side of the tracks was  considered the old part of the town.    The street lights were soon behind them and they depended entirely  upon the lanterns the men carried. Ruth could see very little of the  houses they passed; but at one spot--although it was on the other  side of the road--there were two green lanterns, one on either side  of an arched gate, and there seemed to be a rather large, but gloomy,  house behind the hedge before which these lanterns burned.    \"You will always know my house,\" Doctor Davison said, softly, and  still retaining her hand, \"by its green eyes.\"    So Ruth knew she had passed his home, to which he had so kindly  invited her. And that made her think for a moment about Uncle Jabez  and Aunt Alvirah. Would she find somebody waiting to take her to the  Red Mill when she got back to the station?      CHAPTER IV     THE GATE OF THE GREEN EYES    It was a dark lane, beneath overhanging oaks, that met and intertwined  their branches from either side--this was the Wilkins Corners road.  And it was very steep and stony--up hill and down dale--with deep  ruts in places and other spots where the Spring rains had washed out  the gravel and sand and left exposed the very foundations of the  world.    It seemed as though no bicyclist, or motor-cyclist would have chosen  this road to travel after dark. Yet there was a narrow path at the  side--just wide enough for Ruth and Doctor Davison to walk abreast,  and Reno to trot by the girl's side which seemed pretty smooth.    \"We don't want to go by the spot, Doctor,\" said one of the men walking  ahead with the lights. \"Don't the dog show no signs of looking for  Tom?\"    \"Where's Tom, Reno? Where's Tom?\" asked Ruth, earnestly, believing  that the dog would recognize his master's name.    The mastiff raised his muzzle and barked sharply again, but trotted  onward.    \"He might have fallen down any of these gullies, and we'd miss him,  it's so dark,\" observed the previous speaker.    \"I don't believe the dog will miss the place,\" responded Doctor  Davison.    Just then Reno leaped forward with a long-drawn whine. Ruth hurried  with him, leaving the doctor to come on in the rear. Reno took the  lead and the girl tried to keep pace with him.    It was not for many yards. Reno stopped at the brink of a steep bank  beside the road. This bank fell away into the darkness, but through  the trees, in the far distance, the girl could see several twinkling  lights in a row. She knew that they were on the railroad, and that she  was looking across the great swamp-meadow.    \"Hullo!\" shouted one man, loudly. \"Something down there, old fellow?\"    Reno answered with a short bark and began to scramble down the rough  bank.    \"Here's where somebody has gone down ahead of him,\" cried another of  the searchers, holding his own lantern close to the ground. \"See how  the bank's all torn up? Bet his wheel hit that stone yonder in the  dusk and threw him, wheel and all, into this gulley.\"    \"Wait here, child,\" ordered Doctor Davison, quickly. \"If he is in bad  shape, boys, call me and I'll come down. Lift him carefully--\"    \"He's here, sir!\" cried the first man to descend.    And then Reno lifted up his voice in a mournful howl.    \"Oh, dear! oh, dear!\" murmured Ruth. \"I am afraid he is badly hurt.\"    \"Come, come!\" returned Doctor Davison. \"Be a brave girl now. If he is  badly hurt he'll need us both to keep our wits about us, you know.\"    \"Ye needn't fret none, leetle gal,\" said Jasper Parloe's voice, behind  her. \"Ye couldn't kill that there Cameron boy, I tell ye! He is as  sassy a young'un as there is in this county.\"    Doctor Davison turned as though to say something sharp to the mean old  man; but just then the men below shouted up to him:    \"He's hit his head and his arm's twisted under him, Doctor. He isn't  conscious, but doesn't seem much hurt otherwise.\"    \"Can you bring him up?\" queried the physician.    \"That's what we mean to do,\" was the reply.    Ruth waited beside the old doctor, not without some apprehension. How  would this Tom Cameron look? What kind of a boy was he? According to  Jasper Parloe he was a very bad boy, indeed. She had heard that he was  the son of a rich man. While the men were bringing the senseless body  up the steep bank her mind ran riot with the possibilities that lay in  store for her because of this accident to the dry-goods merchant's  son.    And now the bearers were at the top of the bank, and she could see the  limp form borne by them--a man holding the body under the arms and  another by his feet. But, altogether, it looked really as though they  carried a limp sack between them.    \"Fust time I ever see that boy still,\" murmured Jasper Parloe.    \"Cracky! He's pale; ain't he?\" said another man.    Doctor Davison dropped on one knee beside the body as they laid it  down. The lanterns were drawn together that their combined light might  illuminate the spot. Ruth saw that the figure was that of a youth not  much older than herself--lean, long limbed, well dressed, and with a  face that, had it not been so pale, she would have thought very nice  looking indeed.    \"Poor lad!\" Ruth heard the physician murmur. \"He has had a hard fall--  and that's a nasty knock on his head.\"    The wound was upon the side of his head above the left ear and was now  all clotted with blood. It was from this wound, in some moment of  consciousness, that he had traced the word \"Help\" on his torn  handkerchief, and fastened the latter, with the lamp of his  motorcycle, to the dog's collar.    Here was the machine, bent and twisted enough, brought up the bank by  two of the men.    \"Dunno what you can do for the boy, Doctor,\" said one of them; \"but it  looks to me as though this contraption warn't scurcely wuth savin'.\"    \"Oh, we'll bring the boy around all right,\" said Doctor Davison, who  had felt Tom Cameron's pulse and now rose quickly. \"Lift him carefully  upon the stretcher. We will get him into bed before I do a thing to  him. He's best as he is while we are moving him.\"    \"It'll be a mighty long way to his house,\" grumbled one of the men.    \"I believe yeou!\" rejoined Jasper Parloe. \"Three miles beyond Jabe  Potter's mill.\"    \"Pshaw!\" exclaimed Doctor Davison, in his soft voice. \"You know we'll  not take him so far. My house is near enough. Surely you can carry him  there.\"    \"If you say the word, Doctor,\" said the fellow, more cheerfully, while  old Parloe grunted.    They were more than half an hour in getting to the turn in the main  road where she could observe the two green lights before the doctor's  house. There the men put the stretcher down for a moment. Jasper  Parloe grumblingly took his turn at carrying one end.    \"I never did see the use of boys, noway,\" he growled. \"They's only an  aggravation and vexation of speret. And this here one is the  aggravatingest and vexationingest of any I ever see.\"    \"Don't be too hard on the boy, Jasper,\" said Doctor Davison, passing  on ahead, so as to reach his house first.    Ruth remained behind, for the old gentleman walked too fast for her.  Before the men picked up the stretcher again there was a movement and  a murmur from the injured boy.    \"Hullo!\" said one of the men. \"He's a-talkin', ain't he?\"    \"Jest mutterin',\" said Parloe, who was at Tom's head. \"'Tain't nothin'\"    But Ruth heard the murmur of the unconscious boy, and the words  startled her. They were:    \"It was Jabe Potter--he did it! It was Jabe Potter--he did it!\"    What did they mean? Or, was there no meaning at all to the muttering  of the wounded boy? Ruth saw that Parloe was looking at her in his sly  and disagreeable way, and she knew that he, too, had heard the words.    \"It was Jabe Potter--he did it!\" Was it an accusation referring to  the boy's present plight? And how could her Uncle Jabez--the relative  she had not as yet seen--be the cause of Tom Cameron's injury? The  spot where the boy was hurt must have been five miles from the Red  Mill, and not even on the Osago Lake turnpike, on which highway she  had been given to understand the Red Mill stood.    Not many moments more and the little procession was at the gateway, on  either side of which burned the two green lamps.    Jasper Parloe, who had been relieved, shuffled off into the darkness.  Reno after one pleading look into the face of the hesitating Ruth,  followed the stretcher on which his master lay, in at the gate.    And Ruth Fielding, beginning again to feel most embarrassed and  forsaken, was left alone where the two green eyes winked in the warm,  moist darkness of the Spring night.
