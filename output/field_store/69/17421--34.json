Their way led directly towards the apparent source of the river at the  base of the cliffs, and as I neared this point I found the meadow  dotted with huge boulders that the ravages of time had evidently  dislodged from the towering crags above.    For this reason I came quite close to the cause of the disturbance  before the scene broke upon my horrified gaze.  As I topped a great  boulder I saw the herd of plant men surrounding a little group of  perhaps five or six green men and women of Barsoom.    That I was indeed upon Mars I now had no doubt, for here were members  of the wild hordes that people the dead sea bottoms and deserted cities  of that dying planet.    Here were the great males towering in all the majesty of their imposing  height; here were the gleaming white tusks protruding from their  massive lower jaws to a point near the centre of their foreheads, the  laterally placed, protruding eyes with which they could look forward or  backward, or to either side without turning their heads, here the  strange antennae-like ears rising from the tops of their foreheads; and  the additional pair of arms extending from midway between the shoulders  and the hips.    Even without the glossy green hide and the metal ornaments which  denoted the tribes to which they belonged, I would have known them on  the instant for what they were, for where else in all the universe is  their like duplicated?    There were two men and four females in the party and their ornaments  denoted them as members of different hordes, a fact which tended to  puzzle me infinitely, since the various hordes of green men of Barsoom  are eternally at deadly war with one another, and never, except on that  single historic instance when the great Tars Tarkas of Thark gathered a  hundred and fifty thousand green warriors from several hordes to march  upon the doomed city of Zodanga to rescue Dejah Thoris, Princess of  Helium, from the clutches of Than Kosis, had I seen green Martians of  different hordes associated in other than mortal combat.    But now they stood back to back, facing, in wide-eyed amazement, the  very evidently hostile demonstrations of a common enemy.    Both men and women were armed with long-swords and daggers, but no  firearms were in evidence, else it had been short shrift for the  gruesome plant men of Barsoom.    Presently the leader of the plant men charged the little party, and his  method of attack was as remarkable as it was effective, and by its very  strangeness was the more potent, since in the science of the green  warriors there was no defence for this singular manner of attack, the  like of which it soon was evident to me they were as unfamiliar with as  they were with the monstrosities which confronted them.    The plant man charged to within a dozen feet of the party and then,  with a bound, rose as though to pass directly above their heads.  His  powerful tail was raised high to one side, and as he passed close above  them he brought it down in one terrific sweep that crushed a green  warrior's skull as though it had been an eggshell.    The balance of the frightful herd was now circling rapidly and with  bewildering speed about the little knot of victims.  Their prodigious  bounds and the shrill, screeching purr of their uncanny mouths were  well calculated to confuse and terrorize their prey, so that as two of  them leaped simultaneously from either side, the mighty sweep of those  awful tails met with no resistance and two more green Martians went  down to an ignoble death.    There were now but one warrior and two females left, and it seemed that  it could be but a matter of seconds ere these, also, lay dead upon the  scarlet sward.    But as two more of the plant men charged, the warrior, who was now  prepared by the experiences of the past few minutes, swung his mighty  long-sword aloft and met the hurtling bulk with a clean cut that clove  one of the plant men from chin to groin.    The other, however, dealt a single blow with his cruel tail that laid  both of the females crushed corpses upon the ground.    As the green warrior saw the last of his companions go down and at the  same time perceived that the entire herd was charging him in a body, he  rushed boldly to meet them, swinging his long-sword in the terrific  manner that I had so often seen the men of his kind wield it in their  ferocious and almost continual warfare among their own race.    Cutting and hewing to right and left, he laid an open path straight  through the advancing plant men, and then commenced a mad race for the  forest, in the shelter of which he evidently hoped that he might find a  haven of refuge.    He had turned for that portion of the forest which abutted on the  cliffs, and thus the mad race was taking the entire party farther and  farther from the boulder where I lay concealed.    As I had watched the noble fight which the great warrior had put up  against such enormous odds my heart had swelled in admiration for him,  and acting as I am wont to do, more upon impulse than after mature  deliberation, I instantly sprang from my sheltering rock and bounded  quickly toward the bodies of the dead green Martians, a well-defined  plan of action already formed.    Half a dozen great leaps brought me to the spot, and another instant  saw me again in my stride in quick pursuit of the hideous monsters that  were rapidly gaining on the fleeing warrior, but this time I grasped a  mighty long-sword in my hand and in my heart was the old blood lust of  the fighting man, and a red mist swam before my eyes and I felt my lips  respond to my heart in the old smile that has ever marked me in the  midst of the joy of battle.    Swift as I was I was none too soon, for the green warrior had been  overtaken ere he had made half the distance to the forest, and now he  stood with his back to a boulder, while the herd, temporarily balked,  hissed and screeched about him.    With their single eyes in the centre of their heads and every eye  turned upon their prey, they did not note my soundless approach, so  that I was upon them with my great long-sword and four of them lay dead  ere they knew that I was among them.    For an instant they recoiled before my terrific onslaught, and in that  instant the green warrior rose to the occasion and, springing to my  side, laid to the right and left of him as I had never seen but one  other warrior do, with great circling strokes that formed a figure  eight about him and that never stopped until none stood living to  oppose him, his keen blade passing through flesh and bone and metal as  though each had been alike thin air.    As we bent to the slaughter, far above us rose that shrill, weird cry  which I had heard once before, and which had called the herd to the  attack upon their victims.  Again and again it rose, but we were too  much engaged with the fierce and powerful creatures about us to attempt  to search out even with our eyes the author of the horrid notes.    Great tails lashed in frenzied anger about us, razor-like talons cut  our limbs and bodies, and a green and sticky syrup, such as oozes from  a crushed caterpillar, smeared us from head to foot, for every cut and  thrust of our longswords brought spurts of this stuff upon us from the  severed arteries of the plant men, through which it courses in its  sluggish viscidity in lieu of blood.    Once I felt the great weight of one of the monsters upon my back and as  keen talons sank into my flesh I experienced the frightful sensation of  moist lips sucking the lifeblood from the wounds to which the claws  still clung.    I was very much engaged with a ferocious fellow who was endeavouring to  reach my throat from in front, while two more, one on either side, were  lashing viciously at me with their tails.    The green warrior was much put to it to hold his own, and I felt that  the unequal struggle could last but a moment longer when the huge  fellow discovered my plight, and tearing himself from those that  surrounded him, he raked the assailant from my back with a single sweep  of his blade, and thus relieved I had little difficulty with the others.    Once together, we stood almost back to back against the great boulder,  and thus the creatures were prevented from soaring above us to deliver  their deadly blows, and as we were easily their match while they  remained upon the ground, we were making great headway in dispatching  what remained of them when our attention was again attracted by the  shrill wail of the caller above our heads.    This time I glanced up, and far above us upon a little natural balcony  on the face of the cliff stood a strange figure of a man shrieking out  his shrill signal, the while he waved one hand in the direction of the  river's mouth as though beckoning to some one there, and with the other  pointed and gesticulated toward us.    A glance in the direction toward which he was looking was sufficient to  apprise me of his aims and at the same time to fill me with the dread  of dire apprehension, for, streaming in from all directions across the  meadow, from out of the forest, and from the far distance of the flat  land across the river, I could see converging upon us a hundred  different lines of wildly leaping creatures such as we were now engaged  with, and with them some strange new monsters which ran with great  swiftness, now erect and now upon all fours.    \"It will be a great death,\" I said to my companion. \"Look!\"    As he shot a quick glance in the direction I indicated he smiled.    \"We may at least die fighting and as great warriors should, John  Carter,\" he replied.    We had just finished the last of our immediate antagonists as he spoke,  and I turned in surprised wonderment"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6422"],[0,"The Life, Adventures & Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton (#3)"],[1," careless hussy  was in that lost me; what treatment she received from my justly enraged  father and mother, and the horror these must be in at the thoughts of  their child being thus carried away; for as I never knew anything of the  matter, but just what I have related, nor who my father and mother were,  so it would make but a needless digression to talk of it here.    My good gipsy mother, for some of her worthy actions no doubt, happened  in process of time to be hanged; and as this fell out something too soon  for me to be perfected in the strolling trade, the parish where I was  left, which for my life I can't remember, took some care of me, to be  sure; for the first thing I can remember of myself afterwards, was, that  I went to a parish school, and the minister of the parish used to talk  to me to be a good boy; and that, though I was but a poor boy, if I  minded my book, and served God, I might make a good man.    I believe I was frequently removed from one town to another, perhaps as  the parishes disputed my supposed mother's last settlement. Whether I  was so shifted by passes, or otherwise, I know not; but the town where  I last was kept, whatever its name was, must be not far off from the  seaside; for a master of a ship who took a fancy to me, was the first  that brought me to a place not far from Southampton, which I afterwards  knew to be Bussleton; and there I attended the carpenters, and such  people as were employed in building a ship for him; and when it was  done, though I was not above twelve years old, he carried me to sea with  him on a voyage to Newfoundland.    I lived well enough, and pleased my master so well that he called me his  own boy; and I would have called him father, but he would not allow it,  for he had children of his own. I went three or four voyages with him,  and grew a great sturdy boy, when, coming home again from the banks of  Newfoundland, we were taken by an Algerine rover, or man-of-war; which,  if my account stands right, was about the year 1695, for you may be sure  I kept no journal.    I was not much concerned at the disaster, though I saw my master, after  having been wounded by a splinter in the head during the engagement,  very barbarously used by the Turks; I say, I was not much concerned,  till, upon some unlucky thing I said, which, as I remember, was about  abusing my master, they took me and beat me most unmercifully with a  flat stick on the soles of my feet, so that I could neither go or stand  for several days together.    But my good fortune was my friend upon this occasion; for, as they were  sailing away with our ship in tow as a prize, steering for the Straits,  and in sight of the bay of Cadiz, the Turkish rover was attacked by two  great Portuguese men-of-war, and taken and carried into Lisbon.    As I was not much concerned at my captivity, not indeed understanding  the consequences of it, if it had continued, so I was not suitably  sensible of my deliverance; nor, indeed, was it so much a deliverance  to me as it would otherwise have been, for my master, who was the only  friend I had in the world, died at Lisbon of his wounds; and I being  then almost reduced to my primitive state, viz., of starving, had this  addition to it, that it was in a foreign country too, where I knew  nobody and could not speak a word of their language. However, I fared  better here than I had reason to expect; for when all the rest of our  men had their liberty to go where they would, I, that knew not whither  to go, stayed in the ship for several days, till at length one of the  lieutenants seeing me, inquired what that young English dog did there,  and why they did not turn him on shore.    I heard him, and partly understood what he meant, though not what he  said, and began then to be in a terrible fright; for I knew not where to  get a bit of bread; when the pilot of the ship, an old seaman, seeing me  look very dull, came to me, and speaking broken English to me, told me  I must be gone. \"Whither must I go?\" said I. \"Where you will,\" said he,  \"home to your own country, if you will.\" \"How must I go thither?\" said  I. \"Why, have you no friend?\" said he. \"No,\" said I, \"not in the world,  but that dog,\" pointing to the ship's dog (who, having stolen a piece  of meat just before, had brought it close by me, and I had taken it  from him, and ate it), \"for he has been a good friend, and brought me my  dinner.\"    \"Well, well,\" says he, \"you must have your dinner. Will you go with me?\"  \"Yes,\" says I, \"with all my heart.\" In short, the old pilot took me home  with him, and used me tolerably well, though I fared hard enough; and I  lived with him about two years, during which time he was soliciting his  business, and at length got to be master or pilot under Don Garcia de  Pimentesia de Carravallas, captain of a Portuguese galleon or carrack,  which was bound to Goa, in the East Indies; and immediately having  gotten his commission, put me on board to look after his cabin, in  which he had stored himself with abundance of liquors, succades, sugar,  spices, and other things, for his accommodation in the voyage, and laid  in afterwards a considerable quantity of European goods, fine lace and  linen; and also baize, woollen cloth, stuffs, &c., under the pretence of  his clothes.    I was too young in the trade to keep any journal of this voyage, though  my master, who was, for a Portuguese, a pretty good artist, prompted me  to it; but my not understanding the language was one hindrance; at least  it served me for an excuse. However, after some time, I began to look  into his charts and books; and, as I could write a tolerable hand,  understood some Latin, and began to have a little smattering of  the Portuguese tongue, so I began to get a superficial knowledge of  navigation, but not such as was likely to be sufficient to carry me  through a life of adventure, as mine was to be. In short, I learned  several material things in this voyage among the Portuguese; I learned  particularly to be an arrant thief and a bad sailor; and I think I may  say they are the best masters for teaching both these of any nation in  the world.    We made our way for the East Indies, by the coast of Brazil; not that it  is in the course of sailing the way thither, but our captain, either  on his own account, or by the direction of the merchants, went thither  first, where at All Saints' Bay, or, as they call it in Portugal, the  Rio de Todos los Santos, we delivered near a hundred tons of goods, and  took in a considerable quantity of gold, with some chests of sugar, and  seventy or eighty great rolls of tobacco, every roll weighing at least a  hundredweight.    Here, being lodged on shore by my master's order, I had the charge  of the captain's business, he having seen me very diligent for my own  master; and in requital for his mistaken confidence, I found means to  secure, that is to say, to steal, about twenty moidores out of the  gold that was shipped on board by the merchants, and this was my first  adventure.    We had a tolerable voyage from hence to the Cape de Bona Speranza; and  I was reputed as a mighty diligent servant to my master, and very  faithful. I was diligent indeed, but I was very far from honest;  however, they thought me honest, which, by the way, was their very great  mistake. Upon this very mistake the captain took a particular liking to  me, and employed me frequently on his own occasion; and, on the other  hand, in recompense for my officious diligence, I received several  particular favours from him; particularly, I was, by the captain's  command, made a kind of a steward under the ship's steward, for such  provisions as the captain demanded for his own table. He had another  steward for his private stores besides, but my office concerned only  what the captain called for of the ship's stores for his private use.    However, by this means I had opportunity particularly to take care of my  master's man, and to furnish myself with sufficient provisions to make  me live much better than the other people in the ship; for the captain  seldom ordered anything out of the ship's stores, as above, but I snipt  some of it for my own share. We arrived at Goa, in the East Indies, in  about seven months from Lisbon, and remained there eight more; during  which time I had indeed nothing to do, my master being generally on  shore, but to learn everything that is wicked among the Portuguese, a  nation the most perfidious and the most debauched, the most insolent and  cruel, of any that pretend to call themselves Christians, in the world.    Thieving, lying, swearing, forswearing, joined to the most abominable  lewdness, was the stated practice of the ship's crew; adding to it,  that, with the most insufferable boasts of their own courage, they were,  generally speaking, the most complete cowards that I ever met with;  and the consequence of their cowardice was evident upon many occasions.  However, there was here and there one among them that was not so bad  as the rest; and, as my lot fell among them, it made me have the most  contemptible thoughts of the rest, as indeed they deserved.    I was exactly fitted for their society indeed; for I had no sense of  virtue or religion upon me. I had never heard much of either, except  what a good old parson had said to me when I was a child of about eight  or nine years old; nay, I was preparing and growing up apace to be as  wicked as anybody could be, or perhaps ever was. Fate certainly thus  directed my beginning, knowing that I had work which I had to do in the  world, which nothing but one hardened against all sense of honesty  or religion could go through; and yet, even in this state of original  wickedness, I entertained such a settled abhorrence of the abandoned  vileness of the Portuguese, that I could not but hate them most heartily  from the beginning, and all my life afterwards. They were so brutishly  wicked, so base "]]]
