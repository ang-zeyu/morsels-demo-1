Now, mark the result, father; the  fiery spirit has developed itself--expanded--and behold its precious  fruits. Observe this ingenuousness--how nicely it has changed into  effrontery;--this tenderness of soul--how it displays itself in  dalliance with coquettes, in susceptibility to the blandishments of a  courtesan! See this fiery genius, how in six short years it hath burnt  out the oil of life, and reduced his body to a living skeleton; so that  passing scoffers point at him with a sneer and exclaim--\"_C'est l'amour  qui a fait cela_.\" Behold this bold, enterprising spirit--how it  conceives and executes plans, compared to which the deeds of a Cartouche  or a Howard sink into insignificance. And presently, when these  precious germs of excellence shall ripen into full maturity, what may  not be expected from the full development of such a boyhood? Perhaps,  father, you may yet live to see him at the head of some gallant band,  which assembles in the silent sanctuary of the forest, and kindly  relieves the weary traveller of his superfluous burden. Perhaps you may  yet have the opportunity, before you go to your own tomb, of making a  pilgrimage to the monument which he may erect for himself, somewhere  between earth and heaven! Perhaps,--oh, father--father, look out for  some other name, or the very peddlers and street boys who have seen the  effigy of your worthy son exhibited in the market-place at Leipsic will  point at you with the finger of scorn!    OLD M. And thou, too, my Francis, thou too? Oh, my children, how  unerringly your shafts are levelled at my heart.    FRANCIS. You see that I too have a spirit; but my spirit bears the  sting of a scorpion. And then it was \"the dry commonplace, the cold,  the wooden Francis,\" and all the pretty little epithets which the  contrast between us suggested to your fatherly affection, when he was  sitting on your knee, or playfully patting your cheeks? \"He would die,  forsooth, within the boundaries of his own domain, moulder away, and  soon be forgotten;\" while the fame of this universal genius would spread  from pole to pole! Ah! the cold, dull, wooden Francis thanks thee,  heaven, with uplifted hands, that he bears no resemblance to his  brother.    OLD M. Forgive me, my child! Reproach not thy unhappy father, whose  fondest hopes have proved visionary. The merciful God who, through  Charles, has sent these tears, will, through thee, my Francis, wipe them  from my eyes!    FRANCIS. Yes, father, we will wipe them from your eyes. Your Francis  will devote--his life to prolong yours. (Taking his hand with affected  tenderness.) Your life is the oracle which I will especially consult on  every undertaking--the mirror in which I will contemplate everything.  No duty so sacred but I am ready to violate it for the preservation of  your precious days. You believe me?    OLD M. Great are the duties which devolve on thee, my son--Heaven bless  thee for what thou has been, and wilt be to me.    FRANCIS. Now tell me frankly, father. Should you not be a happy man,  were you not obliged to call this son your own?    OLD M. In mercy, spare me! When the nurse first placed him in my arms,  I held him up to Heaven and exclaimed, \"Am I not truly blest?\"    FRANCIS. So you said then. Now, have you found it so? You may envy  the meanest peasant on your estate in this, that he is not the father of  such a son. So long as you call him yours you are wretched. Your  misery will grow with his years--it will lay you in your grave.    OLD M. Oh! he has already reduced me to the decrepitude of fourscore.    FRANCIS. Well, then--suppose you were to disown this son.    OLD M. (startled). Francis! Francis! what hast thou said!    FRANCIS. Is not your love for him the source of all your grief? Root  out this love, and he concerns you no longer. But for this weak and  reprehensible affection he would be dead to you;--as though he had never  been born. It is not flesh and blood, it is the heart that makes us  sons and fathers! Love him no more, and this monster ceases to be your  son, though he were cut out of your flesh. He has till now been the  apple of your eye; but if thine eye offend you, says Scripture, pluck it  out. It is better to enter heaven with one eye than hell with two! \"It  is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not  that thy whole body should be cast into hell.\" These are the words of  the Bible!    OLD M. Wouldst thou have me curse my son?    FRANCIS. By no means, father. God forbid! But whom do you call your  son? Him to whom you have given life, and who in return does his utmost  to shorten yours.    OLD M. Oh, it is all too true! it is a judgment upon me. The Lord has  chosen him as his instrument.    FRANCIS. See how filially your bosom child behaves. He destroys you by  your own excess of paternal sympathy; murders you by means of the very  love you bear him--has coiled round a father's heart to crush it. When  you are laid beneath the turf he becomes lord of your possessions, and  master of his own will. That barrier removed, and the torrent of his  profligacy will rush on without control. Imagine yourself in his place.  How often he must wish his father under ground--and how often, too, his  brother--who so unmercifully impede the free course of his excesses.  But call you this a requital of love? Is this filial gratitude for a  father's tenderness? to sacrifice ten years of your life to the lewd  pleasures of an hour? in one voluptuous moment to stake the honor of an  ancestry which has stood unspotted through seven centuries? Do you call  this a son? Answer? Do you call this your son?    OLD M. An undutiful son! Alas! but still my child! my child!    FRANCIS. A most amiable and precious child--whose constant study is to  get rid of his father. Oh, that you could learn to see clearly! that  the film might be removed from your eyes! But your indulgence must  confirm him in his vices! your assistance tend to justify them.  Doubtless you will avert the curse of Heaven from his head, but on your  own, father--on yours--will it fall with twofold vengeance.    OLD M. Just! most just! Mine, mine be all the guilt!    FRANCIS. How many thousands who have drained the voluptuous bowl of  pleasure to the dregs have been reclaimed by suffering! And is not the  bodily pain which follows every excess a manifest declaration of the  divine will! And shall man dare to thwart this by an impious exercise  of affection? Shall a father ruin forever the pledge committed to his  charge? Consider, father, if you abandon him for a time to the pressure  of want will not he be obliged to turn from his wickedness and repent?  Otherwise, untaught even in the great school of adversity, he must  remain a confirmed reprobate? And then--woe to the father who by a  culpable tenderness bath frustrated the ordinances of a higher wisdom!  Well, father?    OLD M. I will write to him that I withdraw my protection.    FRANCIS. That would be wise and prudent.    OLD M. That he must never come into my sight again    FRANCIS. 'Twill have a most salutary effect.    OLD M. (tenderly). Until he reforms.    FRANCIS. Right, quite right. But suppose that he comes disguised in  the hypocrite's mask, implores your compassion with tears, and wheedles  from you a pardon, then quits you again on the morrow, and jests at your  weakness in the arms of his harlot. No, my father! He will return of  his own accord, when his conscience awakens him to repentance.    OLD M. I will write to him, on the spot, to that effect.    FRANCIS. Stop, father, one word more. Your just indignation might  prompt reproaches too severe, words which might break his heart--and  then--do you not think that your deigning to write with your own hand  might be construed into an act of forgiveness? It would be better, I  think, that you should commit the task to me?    OLD M. Do it, my son. Ah! it would, indeed, have broken my heart!  Write to him that--    FRANCIS (quickly). That's agreed, then?    OLD M. Say that he has caused me a thousand bitter tears--a thousand  sleepless nights--but, oh! do not drive my son to despair!    FRANCIS. Had you not better retire to rest, father? This affects you  too strongly.    OLD M. Write to him that a father's heart--But I charge you, drive him  not to despair. [Exit in sadness.]    FRANCIS (looking after him with a chuckle). Make thyself easy, old  dotard! thou wilt never more press thy darling to thy bosom--there is a  gulf between thee and him impassable as heaven is from hell. He was  torn from thy arms before even thou couldst have dreamed it possible to  decree the separation. Why, what a sorry bungler should I be had I not  skill enough to pluck a son from a father's heart; ay, though he were  riveted there with hooks of steel! I have drawn around thee a magic  circle of curses which he cannot overleap. Good speed to thee, Master  Francis. Papa's darling is disposed of--the course is clear. I must  carefully pick up all the scraps of paper, for how easily might my  handwriting be recognized. (He gathers the fragments of the letter.)  And grief will soon make an end of the old gentleman. And as for her--  I must tear this Charles from her heart, though half her life come with  him.    No small cause have I for being dissatisfied with Dame Nature, and, by  my honor, I will have amends! Why did I not crawl the first from my  mother's womb? why not the only one? why has she heaped on me this  burden of deformity? on me especially? Just as if she had spawned me  from her refuse.* Why to me in particular this snub of the Laplander?  these negro lips? these Hottentot eyes? On my word, the lady seems to  have collected from all the race of mankind whatever was loathsome into  a heap, and kneaded the mass into my particular person.

Now, then, you have no further need of me.  Enter yon house. 'Tis Werner Stauffacher's,  A man that is a father to distress.  See, there he is himself! Come, follow me.       [They retire up. Scene changes.        SCENE III.       A common near Altdorf. On an eminence in the background a castle     in progress of erection, and so far advanced that the outline of the     whole may be distinguished. The back part is finished; men are     working at the front. Scaffolding, on which the workmen are going     up and down. A slater is seen upon the highest part of the roof.--     All is bustle and activity.       TASKMASTER, MASON, WORKMEN, and LABORERS.    TASKMASTER (with a stick, urging on the workmen).  Up, up! You've rested long enough. To work!  The stones here, now the mortar, and the lime!  And let his lordship see the work advanced  When next he comes. These fellows crawl like snails!       [To two laborers with loads.    What! call ye that a load? Go, double it.  Is this the way ye earn your wages, laggards?    FIRST WORKMAN.  'Tis very hard that we must bear the stones,  To make a keep and dungeon for ourselves!    TASKMASTER.  What's that you mutter? 'Tis a worthless race,  And fit for nothing but to milk their cows,  And saunter idly up and down the mountains.    OLD MAN (sinks down exhausted).  I can no more.    TASKMASTER (shaking him).          Up, up, old man, to work!    FIRST WORKMAN.  Have you no bowels of compassion, thus  To press so hard upon a poor old man,  That scarce can drag his feeble limbs along?    MASTER MASON and WORKMEN.  Shame, shame upon you--shame! It cries to heaven!    TASKMASTER.  Mind your own business. I but do my duty.    FIRST WORKMAN.  Pray, master, what's to be the name of this  Same castle when 'tis built?    TASKMASTER.                 The keep of Uri;  For by it we shall keep you in subjection.    WORKMEN.  The keep of Uri.    TASKMASTER.           Well, why laugh at that?    SECOND WORKMAN.  So you'll keep Uri with this paltry place!    FIRST WORKMAN.  How many molehills such as that must first  Be piled above each other ere you make  A mountain equal to the least in Uri?       [TASKMASTER retires up the stage.    MASTER MASON.  I'll drown the mallet in the deepest lake,  That served my hand on this accursed pile.       [Enter TELL and STAUFFACHER.    STAUFFACHER.  Oh, that I had not lived to see this sight!    TELL.  Here 'tis not good to be. Let us proceed.    STAUFFACHER.  Am I in Uri, in the land of freedom?    MASTER MASON.  Oh, sir, if you could only see the vaults  Beneath these towers. The man that tenants them  Will never hear the cock crow more.    STAUFFACHER.                     O God!    MASTER MASON.  Look at these ramparts and these buttresses,  That seem as they were built to last forever.    TELL.  Hands can destroy whatever hands have reared.       [Pointing to the mountains.    That house of freedom God hath built for us.       [A drum is heard. People enter bearing a cap upon a     pole, followed by a crier. Women and children thronging     tumultuously after them.    FIRST WORKMAN.  What means the drum? Give heed!    MASTER MASON.                   Why here's a mumming!  And look, the cap,--what can they mean by that?    CRIER.  In the emperor's name, give ear!    WORKMEN.                   Hush! silence! hush!    CRIER.  Ye men of Uri, ye do see this cap!  It will be set upon a lofty pole  In Altdorf, in the market-place: and this  Is the lord governor's good will and pleasure,  The cap shall have like honor as himself,  And all shall reverence it with bended knee,  And head uncovered; thus the king will know  Who are his true and loyal subjects here:  His life and goods are forfeit to the crown,  That shall refuse obedience to the order.       [The people burst out into laughter. The drum beats,     and the procession passes on.    FIRST WORKMAN.  A strange device to fall upon, indeed!  Do reverence to a cap! a pretty farce!  Heard ever mortal anything like this?    MASTER MASON.  Down to a cap on bended knee, forsooth!  Rare jesting this with men of sober sense!    FIRST WORKMAN.  Nay, were it but the imperial crown, indeed!  But 'tis the cap of Austria! I've seen it  Hanging above the throne in Gessler's hall.    MASTER MASON.  The cap of Austria! Mark that! A snare  To get us into Austria's power, by heaven!    WORKMEN.  No freeborn man will stoop to such disgrace.    MASTER MASON.  Come--to our comrades, and advise with them!       [They retire up.    TELL (to STAUFFACHER).  You see how matters stand: Farewell, my friend!    STAUFFACHER.  Whither away? Oh, leave us not so soon.    TELL.  They look for me at home. So fare ye well.    STAUFFACHER.  My heart's so full, and has so much to tell you.    TELL.  Words will not make a heart that's heavy light.    STAUFFACHER.  Yet words may possibly conduct to deeds.    TELL.  All we can do is to endure in silence.    STAUFFACHER.  But shall we bear what is not to be borne?    TELL.  Impetuous rulers have the shortest reigns.  When the fierce south wind rises from his chasms,  Men cover up their fires, the ships in haste  Make for the harbor, and the mighty spirit  Sweeps o'er the earth, and leaves no trace behind.  Let every man live quietly at home;  Peace to the peaceful rarely is denied.    STAUFFACHER.  And is it thus you view our grievances?    TELL.  The serpent stings not till it is provoked.  Let them alone; they'll weary of themselves,  Whene'er they see we are not to be roused.    STAUFFACHER.  Much might be done--did we stand fast together.    TELL.  When the ship founders, he will best escape  Who seeks no other's safety but his own.    STAUFFACHER.  And you desert the common cause so coldly?    TELL.  A man can safely count but on himself!    STAUFFACHER.  Nay, even the weak grow strong by union.    TELL.  But the strong man is the strongest when alone.    STAUFFACHER.  Your country, then, cannot rely on you  If in despair she rise against her foes.    TELL.  Tell rescues the lost sheep from yawning gulfs:  Is he a man, then, to desert his friends?  Yet, whatsoe'er you do, spare me from council!  I was not born to ponder and select;  But when your course of action is resolved,  Then call on Tell; you shall not find him fail.      [Exeunt severally. A sudden tumult is heard around the scaffolding.    MASTER MASON (running in).  What's wrong?    FIRST WORKMAN (running forward).          The slater's fallen from the roof.    BERTHA (rushing in).  Is he dashed to pieces? Run--save him, help!  If help be possible, save him! Here is gold.       [Throws her trinkets among the people.    MASTER MASON.  Hence with your gold,--your universal charm,  And remedy for ill! When you have torn  Fathers from children, husbands from their wives,  And scattered woe and wail throughout the land,  You think with gold to compensate for all.  Hence! Till we saw you we were happy men;  With you came misery and dark despair.    BERTHA (to the TASKMASTER, who has returned).  Lives he?     [TASKMASTER shakes his head.        Ill-fated towers, with curses built,  And doomed with curses to be tenanted!                        [Exit.        SCENE IV.       The House of WALTER FURST.  WALTER FURST and ARNOLD     VON MELCHTHAL enter simultaneously at different sides.    MELCHTHAL.  Good Walter Furst.    FURST.            If we should be surprised!  Stay where you are. We are beset with spies.    MELCHTHAL.  Have you no news for me from Unterwald?  What of my father? 'Tis not to be borne,  Thus to be pent up like a felon here!  What have I done of such a heinous stamp,  To skulk and hide me like a murderer?  I only laid my staff across the fingers  Of the pert varlet, when before my eyes,  By order of the governor, he tried  To drive away my handsome team of oxen.    FURST.  You are too rash by far. He did no more  Than what the governor had ordered him.  You had transgressed, and therefore should have paid  The penalty, however hard, in silence.    MELCHTHAL.  Was I to brook the fellow's saucy words?  \"That if the peasant must have bread to eat;  Why, let him go and draw the plough himself!\"  It cut me to the very soul to see  My oxen, noble creatures, when the knave  Unyoked them from the plough. As though they felt  The wrong, they lowed and butted with their horns.  On this I could contain myself no longer,  And, overcome by passion, struck him down.    FURST.  Oh, we old men can scarce command ourselves!  And can we wonder youth shall break its bounds?    MELCHTHAL.  I'm only sorry for my father's sake!  To be away from him, that needs so much  My fostering care! The governor "]]]
