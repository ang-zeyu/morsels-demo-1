A city cemetery could contain the  coffins filled by that brief Terror which we have all been so  diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over; but all France could  hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real Terror  --that unspeakably bitter and awful Terror which none of us has  been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves.    These poor ostensible freemen who were sharing their breakfast  and their talk with me, were as full of humble reverence for their  king and Church and nobility as their worst enemy could desire.  There was something pitifully ludicrous about it.  I asked them  if they supposed a nation of people ever existed, who, with a free  vote in every man's hand, would elect that a single family and its  descendants should reign over it forever, whether gifted or boobies,  to the exclusion of all other families--including the voter's; and  would also elect that a certain hundred families should be raised  to dizzy summits of rank, and clothed on with offensive transmissible  glories and privileges to the exclusion of the rest of the nation's  families--_including his own_.    They all looked unhit, and said they didn't know; that they had  never thought about it before, and it hadn't ever occurred to them  that a nation could be so situated that every man _could_ have  a say in the government.  I said I had seen one--and that it would  last until it had an Established Church.  Again they were all  unhit--at first.  But presently one man looked up and asked me  to state that proposition again; and state it slowly, so it could  soak into his understanding.  I did it; and after a little he had  the idea, and he brought his fist down and said _he_ didn't believe  a nation where every man had a vote would voluntarily get down  in the mud and dirt in any such way; and that to steal from a nation  its will and preference must be a crime and the first of all crimes.  I said to myself:    \"This one's a man.  If I were backed by enough of his sort, I would  make a strike for the welfare of this country, and try to prove  myself its loyalest citizen by making a wholesome change in its  system of government.\"    You see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to one's country, not to  its institutions or its office-holders.  The country is the real  thing, the substantial thing, the eternal thing; it is the thing  to watch over, and care for, and be loyal to; institutions are  extraneous, they are its mere clothing, and clothing can wear out,  become ragged, cease to be comfortable, cease to protect the body  from winter, disease, and death.  To be loyal to rags, to shout  for rags, to worship rags, to die for rags--that is a loyalty  of unreason, it is pure animal; it belongs to monarchy, was invented  by monarchy; let monarchy keep it.  I was from Connecticut, whose  Constitution declares \"that all political power is inherent in  the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority  and instituted for their benefit; and that they have _at all times_  an undeniable and indefeasible right to _alter their form of  government_ in such a manner as they may think expedient.\"    Under that gospel, the citizen who thinks he sees that the  commonwealth's political clothes are worn out, and yet holds his  peace and does not agitate for a new suit, is disloyal; he is  a traitor.  That he may be the only one who thinks he sees this  decay, does not excuse him; it is his duty to agitate anyway, and  it is the duty of the others to vote him down if they do not see  the matter as he does.    And now here I was, in a country where a right to say how the  country should be governed was restricted to six persons in each  thousand of its population.  For the nine hundred and ninety-four  to express dissatisfaction with the regnant system and propose  to change it, would have made the whole six shudder as one man,  it would have been so disloyal, so dishonorable, such putrid black  treason.  So to speak, I was become a stockholder in a corporation  where nine hundred and ninety-four of the members furnished all  the money and did all the work, and the other six elected themselves  a permanent board of direction and took all the dividends.  It seemed  to me that what the nine hundred and ninety-four dupes needed was  a new deal.  The thing that would have best suited the circus side  of my nature would have been to resign the Boss-ship and get up  an insurrection and turn it into a revolution; but I knew that the  Jack Cade or the Wat Tyler who tries such a thing without first  educating his materials up to revolution grade is almost absolutely  certain to get left.  I had never been accustomed to getting left,  even if I do say it myself.  Wherefore, the \"deal\" which had been  for some time working into shape in my mind was of a quite different  pattern from the Cade-Tyler sort.    So I did not talk blood and insurrection to that man there who sat  munching black bread with that abused and mistaught herd of human  sheep, but took him aside and talked matter of another sort to him.  After I had finished, I got him to lend me a little ink from his  veins; and with this and a sliver I wrote on a piece of bark--       Put him in the Man-factory--    and gave it to him, and said:    \"Take it to the palace at Camelot and give it into the hands of  Amyas le Poulet, whom I call Clarence, and he will understand.\"    \"He is a priest, then,\" said the man, and some of the enthusiasm  went out of his face.    \"How--a priest?  Didn't I tell you that no chattel of the Church,  no bond-slave of pope or bishop can enter my Man-Factory?  Didn't  I tell you that _you_ couldn't enter unless your religion, whatever  it might be, was your own free property?\"    \"Marry, it is so, and for that I was glad; wherefore it liked me not,  and bred in me a cold doubt, to hear of this priest being there.\"    \"But he isn't a priest, I tell you.\"    The man looked far from satisfied.  He said:    \"He is not a priest, and yet can read?\"    \"He is not a priest and yet can read--yes, and write, too, for that  matter.  I taught him myself.\" The man's face cleared.  \"And it is  the first thing that you yourself will be taught in that Factory--\"    \"I?  I would give blood out of my heart to know that art.  Why,  I will be your slave, your--\"    \"No you won't, you won't be anybody's slave.  Take your family  and go along.  Your lord the bishop will confiscate your small  property, but no matter.  Clarence will fix you all right.\"        CHAPTER XIV    \"DEFEND THEE, LORD\"    I paid three pennies for my breakfast, and a most extravagant  price it was, too, seeing that one could have breakfasted a dozen  persons for that money; but I was feeling good by this time, and  I had always been a kind of spendthrift anyway; and then these  people had wanted to give me the food for nothing, scant as  their provision was, and so it was a grateful pleasure to emphasize  my appreciation and sincere thankfulness with a good big financial  lift where the money would do so much more good than it would  in my helmet, where, these pennies being made of iron and not  stinted in weight, my half-dollar's worth was a good deal of a  burden to me.  I spent money rather too freely in those days,  it is true; but one reason for it was that I hadn't got the  proportions of things entirely adjusted, even yet, after so long  a sojourn in Britain--hadn't got along to where I was able to  absolutely realize that a penny in Arthur's land and a couple of  dollars in Connecticut were about one and the same thing: just  twins, as you may say, in purchasing power.  If my start from  Camelot could have been delayed a very few days I could have paid  these people in beautiful new coins from our own mint, and that  would have pleased me; and them, too, not less.  I had adopted  the American values exclusively.  In a week or two now, cents,  nickels, dimes, quarters, and half-dollars, and also a trifle of  gold, would be trickling in thin but steady streams all through  the commercial veins of the kingdom, and I looked to see this  new blood freshen up its life.    The farmers were bound to throw in something, to sort of offset  my liberality, whether I would or no; so I let them give me a flint  and steel; and as soon as they had comfortably bestowed Sandy  and me on our horse, I lit my pipe.  When the first blast of smoke  shot out through the bars of my helmet, all those people broke  for the woods, and Sandy went over backwards and struck the ground  with a dull thud.  They thought I was one of those fire-belching  dragons they had heard so much about from knights and other  professional liars.  I had infinite trouble to persuade those people  to venture back within explaining distance.  Then I told them that  this was only a bit of enchantment which would work harm to none  but my enemies.  And I promised, with my hand on my heart, that  if all who felt no enmity toward me would come forward and pass  before me they should see that only those who remained behind would  be struck dead.  The procession moved with a good deal of promptness.  There were no casualties to report, for nobody had curiosity enough  to remain behind to see what would happen.    I lost some time, now, for these big children, their fears gone,  became so ravished with wonder over my awe-compelling fireworks  that I had to stay there and smoke a couple of pipes out before  they would let me go.  Still the delay was not wholly unproductive,  for it took all that time to get Sandy thoroughly wonted to the new  thing, she being so close to it, you know.  It plugged up her  conversation mill, too, for a considerable while, and that was  a gain.  But above all other benefits accruing, I had learned  something.  I was ready for any giant or any ogre that might come  along, now.    We tarried with a holy hermit, that night,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7245"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 4. (#3)"],[1,"too thin;  there wasn't a musician in the country that could.    The queen was a good deal outraged, next morning when she found  she was going to have neither Hugo's life nor his property.  But  I told her she must bear this cross; that while by law and custom  she certainly was entitled to both the man's life and his property,  there were extenuating circumstances, and so in Arthur the king's  name I had pardoned him.  The deer was ravaging the man's fields,  and he had killed it in sudden passion, and not for gain; and he  had carried it into the royal forest in the hope that that might make  detection of the misdoer impossible.  Confound her, I couldn't  make her see that sudden passion is an extenuating circumstance  in the killing of venison--or of a person--so I gave it up and let  her sulk it out.  I _did_ think I was going to make her see it by  remarking that her own sudden passion in the case of the page  modified that crime.    \"Crime!\" she exclaimed.  \"How thou talkest!  Crime, forsooth!  Man, I am going to _pay_ for him!\"    Oh, it was no use to waste sense on her.  Training--training is  everything; training is all there is _to_ a person.  We speak of  nature; it is folly; there is no such thing as nature; what we  call by that misleading name is merely heredity and training.  We have no thoughts of our own, no opinions of our own; they are  transmitted to us, trained into us.  All that is original in us,  and therefore fairly creditable or discreditable to us, can be  covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the  rest being atoms contributed by, and inherited from, a procession  of ancestors that stretches back a billion years to the Adam-clam  or grasshopper or monkey from whom our race has been so tediously  and ostentatiously and unprofitably developed.  And as for me,  all that I think about in this plodding sad pilgrimage, this  pathetic drift between the eternities, is to look out and humbly  live a pure and high and blameless life, and save that one  microscopic atom in me that is truly _me_: the rest may land in  Sheol and welcome for all I care.    No, confound her, her intellect was good, she had brains enough,  but her training made her an ass--that is, from a many-centuries-later  point of view.  To kill the page was no crime--it was her right;  and upon her right she stood, serenely and unconscious of offense.  She was a result of generations of training in the unexamined and  unassailed belief that the law which permitted her to kill a subject  when she chose was a perfectly right and righteous one.    Well, we must give even Satan his due.  She deserved a compliment  for one thing; and I tried to pay it, but the words stuck in my  throat.  She had a right to kill the boy, but she was in no wise  obliged to pay for him.  That was law for some other people, but  not for her.  She knew quite well that she was doing a large and  generous thing to pay for that lad, and that I ought in common  fairness to come out with something handsome about it, but I  couldn't--my mouth refused.  I couldn't help seeing, in my fancy,  that poor old grandma with the broken heart, and that fair young  creature lying butchered, his little silken pomps and vanities  laced with his golden blood.  How could she _pay_ for him!  _Whom_  could she pay?  And so, well knowing that this woman, trained  as she had been, deserved praise, even adulation, I was yet not  able to utter it, trained as I had been.  The best I could do was  to fish up a compliment from outside, so to speak--and the pity  of it was, that it was true:    \"Madame, your people will adore you for this.\"    Quite true, but I meant to hang her for it some day if I lived.  Some of those laws were too bad, altogether too bad.  A master  might kill his slave for nothing--for mere spite, malice, or  to pass the time--just as we have seen that the crowned head could  do it with _his_ slave, that is to say, anybody.  A gentleman could  kill a free commoner, and pay for him--cash or garden-truck.  A noble could kill a noble without expense, as far as the law was  concerned, but reprisals in kind were to be expected.  _Any_body  could kill _some_body, except the commoner and the slave; these had  no privileges.  If they killed, it was murder, and the law wouldn't  stand murder.  It made short work of the experimenter--and of  his family, too, if he murdered somebody who belonged up among  the ornamental ranks.  If a commoner gave a noble even so much  as a Damiens-scratch which didn't kill or even hurt, he got Damiens'  dose for it just the same; they pulled him to rags and tatters  with horses, and all the world came to see the show, and crack  jokes, and have a good time; and some of the performances of the  best people present were as tough, and as properly unprintable,  as any that have been printed by the pleasant Casanova in his  chapter about the dismemberment of Louis XV's poor awkward enemy.    I had had enough of this grisly place by this time, and wanted  to leave, but I couldn't, because I had something on my mind that  my conscience kept prodding me about, and wouldn't let me forget.  If I had the remaking of man, he wouldn't have any conscience.  It is one of the most disagreeable things connected with a person;  and although it certainly does a great deal of good, it cannot  be said to pay, in the long run; it would be much better to have  less good and more comfort.  Still, this is only my opinion, and  I am only one man; others, with less experience, may think  differently.  They have a right to their view.  I only stand  to this: I have noticed my conscience for many years, and I know  it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else I started  with.  I suppose that in the beginning I prized it, because we  prize anything that is ours; and yet how foolish it was to think so.  If we look at it in another way, we see how absurd it is: if I had  an anvil in me would I prize it?  Of course not.  And yet when you  come to think, there is no real difference between a conscience  and an anvil--I mean for comfort.  I have noticed it a thousand  times.  And you could dissolve an anvil with acids, when you  couldn't stand it any longer; but there isn't any way that you can  work off a conscience--at least so it will stay worked off; not  that I know of, anyway.    There was something I wanted to do before leaving, but it was  a disagreeable matter, and I hated to go at it.  Well, it bothered  me all the morning.  I could have mentioned it to the old king,  but what would be the use?--he was but an extinct volcano; he had  been active in his time, but his fire was out, this good while,  he was only a stately ash-pile now; gentle enough, and kindly  enough for my purpose, without doubt, but not usable.  He was  nothing, this so-called king: the queen was the only power there.  And she was a Vesuvius.  As a favor, she might consent to warm  a flock of sparrows for you, but then she might take that very  opportunity to turn herself loose and bury a city.  However,  I reflected that as often as any other way, when you are expecting  the worst, you get something that is not so bad, after all.    So I braced up and placed my matter before her royal Highness.  I said I had been having a general jail-delivery at Camelot and  among neighboring castles, and with her permission I would like  to examine her collection, her bric-a-brac--that is to say, her  prisoners.  She resisted; but I was expecting that.  But she finally  consented.  I was expecting that, too, but not so soon.  That about  ended my discomfort.  She called her guards and torches, and  we went down into the dungeons.  These were down under the castle's  foundations, and mainly were small cells hollowed out of the living  rock.  Some of these cells had no light at all.  In one of them was  a woman, in foul rags, who sat on the ground, and would not answer  a question or speak a word, but only looked up at us once or twice,  through a cobweb of tangled hair, as if to see what casual thing  it might be that was disturbing with sound and light the meaningless  dull dream that was become her life; after that, she sat bowed,  with her dirt-caked fingers idly interlocked in her lap, and gave  no further sign.  This poor rack of bones was a woman of middle  age, apparently; but only apparently; she had been there nine  years, and was eighteen when she entered.  She was a commoner,  and had been sent here on her bridal night by Sir Breuse Sance Pite,  a neighboring lord whose vassal her father was, and to which said  lord she had refused what has since been called le droit du  seigneur, and, moreover, had opposed violence to violence and spilt  half a gill of his almost sacred blood.  The young husband had  interfered at that point, believing the bride's life in danger,  and had flung the noble out into the midst of the humble and  trembling wedding guests, in the parlor, and left him there  astonished at this strange treatment, and implacably embittered  against both bride and groom.  The said lord being cramped for  dungeon-room had asked the queen to accommodate his two criminals,  and here in her bastile they had been ever since; hither, indeed,  they had come before their crime was an hour old, and had never  seen each other since.  Here they were, kenneled like toads in the  same rock; they had passed nine pitch dark years within fifty feet  of each other, yet neither knew whether the other was alive or not.  All the first years, their only question had been--asked with  beseechings and tears that might have moved stones, in time,  perhaps, but hearts are not stones: \"Is he alive?\"  \"Is she alive?\"  But they had never got an answer; and at last that question was  not asked any more--or any other.    I wanted to see the man, after hearing all this.  He was thirty-four  years old, and looked sixty.  He sat upon a squared block of  stone, with his head bent down,"]]]
