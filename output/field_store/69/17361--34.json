Let us note that the suffragist does not--except, perhaps, when she is  addressing herself to unfledged girls and to the sexually  embittered--really produce much effect by inveighing against the legal  grievances of woman under the bastardy laws, the divorce laws, and the  law which fixes the legal age of consent. This kind of appeal does not  go down with the ordinary man and woman--first, because there are many  who think that in spite of occasional hardships the public advantage  is, on the whole, very well served by the existing laws; secondly,  because any alterations which might be desirable could very easily be  made without recourse to woman's suffrage; and thirdly, because the  suffragist consistently acts on the principle of bringing up against  man everything that can possibly be brought up against him, and of  never allowing anything to appear on the credit side of the ledger.    The arguments which the woman suffragist really places confidence in  are those which are provided by undefined general principles,  apothegms set out in the form of axioms, formulae which are vehicles  for fallacies, ambiguous abstract terms, and \"question-begging\"  epithets. Your ordinary unsophisticated man and woman stand almost  helpless against arguments of this kind.    For these bring to bear moral pressure upon human nature.  And when  the intellect is confused by a word or formula which conveys an  ethical appeal, one may very easily find oneself committed to action  which one's unbiased reason would never have approved. The very first  requirement in connexion with any word or phrase which conveys a moral  exhortation is, therefore, to analyse it and find out its true  signification. For all such concepts as justice, rights, freedom,  chivalry--and it is with these that we shall be specially  concerned--are, when properly defined and understood beacon-lights,  but when ill understood and undefined, stumbling-blocks in the path of  humanity.    We may appropriately begin by analysing the term \"Woman's Rights\" and  the correlative formula \"Woman has a right to the suffrage.\"    Our attention here immediately focuses upon the term _right_.  It is  one of the most important of the verbal agents by which the suffragist  hopes to bring moral pressure to bear upon man.    Now, the term _right_ denotes in its juridical sense a debt which is  owed to us by the State. A right is created when the community binds  itself to us, its individual members, to intervene by force to  restrain any one from interfering with us, and to protect us in the  enjoyment of our faculties, privileges, and property.    The term is capable of being given a wider meaning.  While no one  could appropriately speak of our having a _right_ to health or  anything that man has not the power to bestow, it is arguable that  there are, independent of and antecedent to law, elementary rights: a  right to freedom; a right to protection against personal violence; a  right to the protection of our property; and a right to the impartial  administration of regulations which are binding upon all. Such a use  of the term _right_ could be justified on the ground that everybody  would be willing to make personal sacrifices, and to combine with his  fellows for the purpose of securing these essentials--an understanding  which would almost amount to legal sanction.    The suffragist who employs the term \"Woman's _Rights_\" does not employ  the word rights in either of these senses. Her case is analogous to  that of a man who should in a republic argue about the divine _right_  of kings; or that of the Liberal who should argue that it was his  _right_ to live permanently under a Liberal government; or of any  member of a minority who should, with a view of getting what he wants,  argue that he was contending only for his rights.    The woman suffragist is merely bluffing.  Her formula \"_Woman's  Rights_\" means simply \"_Woman's Claims_.\"    For the moment--for we shall presently be coming back to the question  of the enforcement of rights--our task is to examine the arguments  which the suffragist brings forward in support of her claims.    First and chief among these is the argument that the _Principle of  Justice_ prescribes that women should be enfranchised.    When we inquire what the suffragist understands under the Principle of  Justice, one receives by way of answer only the _petitio principii  [question begging]_ that Justice is a moral principle which includes  woman suffrage among its implications.    In reality it is only very few who clearly apprehend the nature of  Justice. For under this appellation two quite different principles are  confounded.    The primary and correct signification of the term Justice will perhaps  be best arrived at by pursuing the following train of considerations:--    When man, long impatient at arbitrary and quite incalculable  autocratic judgments, proceeded to build up a legal system to take the  place of these, he built it upon the following series of  axioms:--(_a_) All actions of which the courts are to take cognisance  shall be classified. (_b_) The legal consequences of each class of  action shall be definitely fixed. (_c_) The courts shall adjudicate  only on questions of fact, and on the issue as to how the particular  deed which is the cause of action should be classified. And (_d_) such  decisions shall carry with them in an automatic manner the appointed  legal consequences.    For example, if a man be arraigned for the appropriation of another  man's goods, it is an axiom that the court (when once the questions of  fact have been disposed of) shall adjudicate only on the issue as to  whether the particular appropriation of goods in dispute comes under  the denomination of larceny, burglary, or other co-ordinate category;  and that upon this the sentence shall go forth: directing that the  legal consequences which are appointed to that particular class of  action be enforced.    This is the system every one can see administered in every court of  justice.    There is, however, over and above what has just been set out another  essential element in Justice. It is an element which readily escapes  the eye.    I have in view the fact that the classifications which are adopted and  embodied in the law must not be arbitrary classifications. They must  all be conformable to the principle of utility, and be directed to the  advantage of society.    If, for instance, burglary is placed in a class apart from larceny, it  is discriminated from it because this distinction is demanded by  considerations of public advantage. But considerations of utility  would not countenance, and by consequence Justice would not accept, a  classification of theft into theft committed by a poor man and theft  committed by a rich man.    The conception of Justice is thus everywhere interfused with  considerations of utility and expediency.    It will have become plain that if we have in view the justice which is  administered in the courts--we may here term it _Juridical  Justice_--then the question as to whether it is _just_ to refuse the  suffrage to woman will be determined by considering whether the  classification of men as voters and of women as non-voters is in the  public interest. Put otherwise, the question whether it would be just  that woman should have a vote would require the answer \"Yes\" or \"No,\"  according as the question whether it would be expedient or inexpedient  that woman should vote required the answer \"Yes\" or \"No.\" But it would  be for the electorate, not for the woman suffragist, to decide that  question.    There is, as already indicated, another principle which passes under  the name of Justice. I have in view the principle that in the  distribution of wealth or political power, or any other privileges  which it is in the power of the State to bestow, every man should  share equally with every other man, and every woman equally with every  man, and that in countries where Europeans and natives live side by  side, these latter should share all privileges equally with the  white--the goal of endeavour being that all distinctions depending  upon natural endowment, sex, and race should be effaced.    We may call this principle the _Principle of Egalitarian  Equity_--first, because it aims at establishing a quite artificial  equality; secondly, because it makes appeal to our ethical instincts,  and claims on that ground to override the distinctions of which formal  law takes account.    But let us reflect that we have here a principle which properly  understood, embraces in its purview all mankind, and not mankind only  but also the lower animals. That is to say, we have here a principle,  which consistently followed out, would make of every man and woman _in  primis [at first]_ a socialist; then a woman suffragist; then a  philo-native, negrophil, and an advocate of the political rights of  natives and negroes; and then, by logical compulsion ant  anti-vivisectionist, who accounts it _unjust_ to experiment on an  animal; a vegetarian, who accounts it _unjust_ to kill animals for  food; and findly one who, like the Jains, accounts it unjust to take  the life of even verminous insects.    If we accept this principle of egalitarian equity as of absolute  obligation, we shall have to accept along with woman's suffrage all  the other \"isms\" believed in, and agitated for, by the cranks who are  so numerously represented in the ranks of woman suffragists.    If, on the other hand, we accept the doctrine of egalitarian equity  with the qualification that it shall apply only so far as what it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],[0,"The Rat Race (#3)"],[1,"is Myrtle, Mr. Tompkins,\" she replied, and did not bother to  add the \"as well you know\" she implied.    \"From now on, Myrtle, you shall be Mary so far as I am concerned. And  where, Mary, shall I leave my hat and coat?\"    \"In the den, sir, of course. Come, I'll lend a hand. You've been  drinking again.\"    The girl moved quite close to me, in helping me off with my things and  it was only by a distinct effort of will that I refrained from giving  that provocative hip the tweak it so openly invited.    \"This way, Mr. Tompkins,\" she said sarcastically, so I rewarded her  with a half-hearted smack which brought the requisite \"Oh!\"--you never  can tell when you will need a friend below stairs and it was obvious  that Winnie, the dog! had been trifling with her young buttocks if not  her affections. That sort of thing must stop, if I was going to get  anywhere in my run through the maze. Too abrupt a change in the manners  and morals of Winfred Tompkins, however, might arouse suspicion.    \"Any news today, Mary?\" I asked.    \"Nothing, sir. The kennels telephoned to say that Ponto had made a  miraculous recovery and could come home tomorrow. I had them send word  to the Club to tell you. And Mrs. Tompkins, as I said, forgot to eat  her apple.\"    I looked at her. This was a cue. I mustn't miss it.    \"And the doctor didn't keep away?\" I asked.    \"Him? I should say not! Mrs. Tompkins felt quite unsettled right after  lunch and phoned Dr. Rutherford to come over. He's with her now,  upstairs, giving her an examination.\" She rolled her eyes significantly  in the direction of the second story.    \"Wait a few minutes till I catch my breath and get my bearings, Mary,\"  I said, \"and then tell Mrs. Tompkins most discreetly, if you know what  I mean, that I have returned and am waiting in my--\" I waved vaguely at  the room.    \"In your den, sir,\" she agreed. \"The name is Myrtle.\"    The den was one of those things I have never attained, perhaps because  I never wanted to. There was a field-stone fireplace, over which the  antlered head of a small stag presided with four upturned feet--like a  calf in a butcher shop--that held two well dusted shotguns. The walls  were lined with books up to a dado--books in sets, with red morocco and  gilt bindings: Dickens, Thackeray, Surtees, Robert Louis Stevenson,  Dumas, Balzac and similar standard authors--all highly respectable and  mostly unread. On the table, beside a humidor and cigarette cases, was  a formidable array of unused pipes. Above the shelves, the walls were  adorned with etchings of ducks: ducks sitting, ducks swimming, ducks  nesting, ducks flying and ducks hanging dead. It was as though Winnie's  conscience or attorney had advised him: \"You can't go wrong on ducks,  old boy!\" Instead, he had gone wild.    In one corner of the den my unregenerate Navy eye discerned a  small portable bar, with gleaming glasses, decanters and syphons.  Further investigation was rewarded by the makings of a very fair  Scotch-and-soda. To my annoyance, the cigarette box contained only de  luxe Benson & Hedges--it would!--while I am a sucker for Tareytons.  Still, any cigarette is better than no cigarette. A little mooching  around the fireplace revealed the switch which turned on an electric  fire, ingeniously contrived to represent an expensive Manhattan  architect's idea of smouldering peat. The whole effect was very cosy in  the \"Town and Country\" sense--a gentleman's gun-room--and I had settled  down most comfortably on the broad leather divan in front of this  synthetic blaze when I was interrupted by an angry, tenor voice.    \"I say, Tompkins,\" soared the voice. \"I thought we had agreed to be  civilized about this thing.\"    I raised my head to see a lean, dark-haired, dapper little man, with  a dinky little British Raj mustache and a faint odor of antiseptics,  glaring at me from the doorway.    \"Dr. Rutherford, I presume!\" I remarked.    \"Yes, Winnie,\" came a pleasant but irritated womanly voice from  somewhere behind the doctor, \"and I too would like to know what this  means.\"    \"Is that you, Jimmie?\" I guessed.    \"Of course it's me! Who else did you expect? One of those flashy  blondes from your office?\"    \"Sh!\" shushed the doctor reprovingly. \"What about Virginia? What have  you done with her?\"    This required serious thought. The glass of Scotch was a good alibi for  amnesia. \"To whom do you refer?\" I asked, putting a slight thickness  into my voice.    \"To Virginia, my wife!\" he snapped. \"We agreed--it was understood  between the four of us--\"    I shook my head virtuously. \"I haven't set eyes on her all day,\" I  said. \"I don't know where she is and I refuse to be held responsible  for her in any particular. She's your look-out, not mine.\"    \"Why, you!--\" The doctor started forward, menacing me with his surgical  little fists.    \"Wait a minute, Jerry,\" the contralto voice ordered. \"Let me handle  this!\"    Germaine Tompkins stepped forward into the room and stood in the  flickering light of the electric peat. \"Tell me, Winnie,\" she asked,  \"has anything gone wrong?\"    My wife was a tall, slim girl, with dark eyes, dark hair parted sleekly  in the 1860 style, and a cool, slender neck. She was wearing something  low-cut in black velvet, with a white cameo brooch at the \"V\" of a  bodice which suggested a potentially undemure Quakeress. I noticed that  she had angry eyes, a sulky mouth and a puzzled expression.    \"I'm sorry, Jimmie,\" I replied, after a good look at her, \"but I have  decided that I simply couldn't go through with it.\"    \"Do you mean to say--\" Dr. Rutherford began, only to be hushed by  Germaine. \"Let me handle him, Jerry,\" she whispered. \"You'd better go.  He's tight. I'll phone you in the morning.\"    \"All right, if you say so, dear,\" the doctor obeyed.    \"And be sure to send me a bill for this call,\" I added. \"Professional  services and what-not. And don't come back to my house without my  personal invitation.\"    Dr. Rutherford emitted a muttered comment and disappeared into the  gloom of the hall. My wife followed him and I could hear a series of  confused and comforting whispers sending him on his way. I had finished  my Scotch and poured myself another before my wife rejoined me.    \"Have a drink?\" I asked.    \"No thank you!\" she snapped.    \"Mad at me?\"    \"What do you think?\" Her tone was cool enough to freeze lava.    \"You have every right to be!\" That answer, I had found by experience,  was unanswerable.    \"What do you mean?\" she asked in some bewilderment. \"Yes, thanks, I  will have a drink after all. You see, Winnie, after we had talked it  all over the other night after the Bond Rally Dance and realized how we  felt about it all, the four of us decided to be--well--civilized about  things. And now--\"    \"I don't feel civilized about my wife,\" I said, pouring her a stiff one.    Her eyes glittered and her cheek was tinged with color. In spite of  her anger, she responded to the idea of male brutes contesting for her  favor.    \"I didn't think you cared a damn,\" she said at last, \"and it's pretty  late in the day to make a change now. After all, there is Virginia.\"    That was the cue to clinch the situation. \"To hell with Virginia!\" I  announced. \"I'd rather live with you as your friend than sleep with la  Rutherford in ten thousand beds. I can't help it,\" I added boyishly.    She leaned forward and sniffed. \"You _have_ been drinking, haven't  you?\" she remarked.    \"Of course I have! Today, in town, I suddenly realized what a damn  fool I'd been to throw away something really fine for something very  second-rate. So I drank. Too much. And the more I drank the more I knew  that I was right and that it was here where I belong, with you. If you  don't want me to stay, I'll go over to the Country Club for the night.  I'll even phone Jerry Rutherford for you--him and his moustache--but  I'm damned if I'll go running back to Virginia. She's not pukka!\"  (\"How'm I doing?\" I added silently for the benefit of the Master of  Ceremonies.)    \"Well--\" she said, after a long pause. \"Perhaps--It's so mixed  up--Perhaps you'd better go to bed here and we can talk it over in the  morning. All of us.\"    I shook my head. \"I don't want to hold any more mass-meetings on the  state of our mutual affections. If you want that tenor tonsil-snatcher,  you're welcome to him but I'm damned if I'll be a good sport about  it. If you insist, I'll buy you a divorce, but I won't marry  Virginia--that's final!\"    Germaine's face relaxed. She smiled. \"We'll see how things look to you  in the morning,\" she said.    Now was the time to play the trump card.    \"Oh yes,\" I said. \"I brought home a present for you.\"    I walked over to the hanger in the corner and pulled the Tiffany  packages from my overcoat pocket.    \"Here you are, Jimmie Tompkins,\" I said, \"with all my alleged love.\"    \"Alleged is right!\" But she picked eagerly at the wrappings and swiftly  ferreted out the diamond brooch. \"Why, Winnie, it's lovely--\" she  began, then whirled on me, her eyes blazing. \"Is this a joke?\" she  demanded.    \"Of course not! What's the matter?\"    Her laugh was wild. \"Oh, nothing, Winnie. Nothing at all. It's just  that you should have decided to give _me_--on _her_ birthday--a brooch  with her initials in diamonds. See them! V.M.R.\"    So that's the catch, I thought. I should have guessed there would be  something wrong with the set-up and I kicked myself for not having  bothered to trace out the monogram.    \"Don't you see what I mean,\" I grated, \"or must I spell it out for you?  Some time back, when we were considering all this civilized swapping  of husbands and wives, I put in the order at Tiffany's for Virginia's  birthday present. Today, when I picked it up, the clerk smirked at  me--he knows your initials don't begin with V--and I suddenly knew I  couldn't go ahead with the whole business. So I brought the brooch back  to you as a trophy, if you want it. You can"]]]
