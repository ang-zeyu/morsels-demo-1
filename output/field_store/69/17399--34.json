It is true, however, that it is not customary to pull down all the  houses of a town with the single design of rebuilding them differently,  and thereby rendering the streets more handsome; but it often happens  that a private individual takes down his own with the view of erecting  it anew, and that people are even sometimes constrained to this when  their houses are in danger of falling from age, or when the foundations  are insecure.  With this before me by way of example, I was persuaded  that it would indeed be preposterous for a private individual to think  of reforming a state by fundamentally changing it throughout, and  overturning it in order to set it up amended; and the same I thought  was true of any similar project for reforming the body of the sciences,  or the order of teaching them established in the schools:  but as for  the opinions which up to that time I had embraced, I thought that I  could not do better than resolve at once to sweep them wholly away,  that I might afterwards be in a position to admit either others more  correct, or even perhaps the same when they had undergone the scrutiny  of reason.  I firmly believed that in this way I should much better  succeed in the conduct of my life, than if I built only upon old  foundations, and leaned upon principles which, in my youth, I had taken  upon trust.  For although I recognized various difficulties in this  undertaking, these were not, however, without remedy, nor once to be  compared with such as attend the slightest reformation in public  affairs.  Large bodies, if once overthrown, are with great difficulty  set up again, or even kept erect when once seriously shaken, and the  fall of such is always disastrous.  Then if there are any imperfections  in the constitutions of states (and that many such exist the diversity  of constitutions is alone sufficient to assure us), custom has without  doubt materially smoothed their inconveniences, and has even managed to  steer altogether clear of, or insensibly corrected a number which  sagacity could not have provided against with equal effect; and, in  fine, the defects are almost always more tolerable than the change  necessary for their removal; in the same manner that highways which  wind among mountains, by being much frequented, become gradually so  smooth and commodious, that it is much better to follow them than to  seek a straighter path by climbing over the tops of rocks and  descending to the bottoms of precipices.    Hence it is that I cannot in any degree approve of those restless and  busy meddlers who, called neither by birth nor fortune to take part in  the management of public affairs, are yet always projecting reforms;  and if I thought that this tract contained aught which might justify  the suspicion that I was a victim of such folly, I would by no means  permit its publication.  I have never contemplated anything higher than  the reformation of my own opinions, and basing them on a foundation  wholly my own.  And although my own satisfaction with my work has led  me to present here a draft of it, I do not by any means therefore  recommend to every one else to make a similar attempt.  Those whom God  has endowed with a larger measure of genius will entertain, perhaps,  designs still more exalted; but for the many I am much afraid lest even  the present undertaking be more than they can safely venture to  imitate.  The single design to strip one's self of all past beliefs is  one that ought not to be taken by every one.  The majority of men is  composed of two classes, for neither of which would this be at all a  befitting resolution:  in the first place, of those who with more than  a due confidence in their own powers, are precipitate in their  judgments and want the patience requisite for orderly and circumspect  thinking; whence it happens, that if men of this class once take the  liberty to doubt of their accustomed opinions, and quit the beaten  highway, they will never be able to thread the byway that would lead  them by a shorter course, and will lose themselves and continue to  wander for life; in the second place, of those who, possessed of  sufficient sense or modesty to determine that there are others who  excel them in the power of discriminating between truth and error, and  by whom they may be instructed, ought rather to content themselves with  the opinions of such than trust for more correct to their own reason.    For my own part, I should doubtless have belonged to the latter class,  had I received instruction from but one master, or had I never known  the diversities of opinion that from time immemorial have prevailed  among men of the greatest learning.  But I had become aware, even so  early as during my college life, that no opinion, however absurd and  incredible, can be imagined, which has not been maintained by some on  of the philosophers; and afterwards in the course of my travels I  remarked that all those whose opinions are decidedly repugnant to ours  are not in that account barbarians and savages, but on the contrary  that many of these nations make an equally good, if not better, use of  their reason than we do.  I took into account also the very different  character which a person brought up from infancy in France or Germany  exhibits, from that which, with the same mind originally, this  individual would have possessed had he lived always among the Chinese  or with savages, and the circumstance that in dress itself the fashion  which pleased us ten years ago, and which may again, perhaps, be  received into favor before ten years have gone, appears to us at this  moment extravagant and ridiculous.  I was thus led to infer that the  ground of our opinions is far more custom and example than any certain  knowledge.  And, finally, although such be the ground of our opinions,  I remarked that a plurality of suffrages is no guarantee of truth where  it is at all of difficult discovery, as in such cases it is much more  likely that it will be found by one than by many.  I could, however,  select from the crowd no one whose opinions seemed worthy of  preference, and thus I found myself constrained, as it were, to use my  own reason in the conduct of my life.    But like one walking alone and in the dark, I resolved to proceed so  slowly and with such circumspection, that if I did not advance far, I  would at least guard against falling.  I did not even choose to dismiss  summarily any of the opinions that had crept into my belief without  having been introduced by reason, but first of all took sufficient time  carefully to satisfy myself of the general nature of the task I was  setting myself, and ascertain the true method by which to arrive at the  knowledge of whatever lay within the compass of my powers.    Among the branches of philosophy, I had, at an earlier period, given  some attention to logic, and among those of the mathematics to  geometrical analysis and algebra,--three arts or sciences which ought,  as I conceived, to contribute something to my design.  But, on  examination, I found that, as for logic, its syllogisms and the  majority of its other precepts are of avail--rather in the  communication of what we already know, or even as the art of Lully, in  speaking without judgment of things of which we are ignorant, than in  the investigation of the unknown; and although this science contains  indeed a number of correct and very excellent precepts, there are,  nevertheless, so many others, and these either injurious or  superfluous, mingled with the former, that it is almost quite as  difficult to effect a severance of the true from the false as it is to  extract a Diana or a Minerva from a rough block of marble.  Then as to  the analysis of the ancients and the algebra of the moderns, besides  that they embrace only matters highly abstract, and, to appearance, of  no use, the former is so exclusively restricted to the consideration of  figures, that it can exercise the understanding only on condition of  greatly fatiguing the imagination; and, in the latter, there is so  complete a subjection to certain rules and formulas, that there results  an art full of confusion and obscurity calculated to embarrass, instead  of a science fitted to cultivate the mind.  By these considerations I  was induced to seek some other method which would comprise the  advantages of the three and be exempt from their defects.  And as a  multitude of laws often only hampers justice, so that a state is best  governed when, with few laws, these are rigidly administered; in like  manner, instead of the great number of precepts of which logic is  composed, I believed that the four following would prove perfectly  sufficient for me, provided I took the firm and unwavering resolution  never in a single instance to fail in observing them.    The first was never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly  know to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and  prejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgement than what was  presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground  of doubt.    The second, to divide each of the difficulties under examination into  as many parts as possible, and as might be necessary for its adequate  solution.    The third, to conduct my thoughts in such order that, by commencing  with objects the simplest and easiest to know, I might ascend by little  and little, and, as it were, step by step, to the knowledge of the more  complex; assigning in thought a certain order even to those objects  which in their own nature do not stand in a relation of antecedence and  sequence.    And the last, in every case to make enumerations so complete, and  reviews so general, that I might be assured that nothing was omitted.

It  originally bore the odd title of _The Sea-Cook_, and, as I have told  before, I showed it to Mr Henderson, the proprietor of the _Young Folks'  Paper_, who came to an arrangement with Mr Stevenson, and the story duly  appeared in its pages, as well as the two which succeeded it.    Stevenson himself in his article in _The Idler_ for August 1894  (reprinted in _My First Book_ volume and in a late volume of the  _Edinburgh Edition_) has recalled some of the circumstances connected  with this visit of mine to Braemar, as it bore on the destination of  _Treasure Island_:       \"And now, who should come dropping in, _ex machina_, but Dr Japp, like     the disguised prince, who is to bring down the curtain upon peace and     happiness in the last act; for he carried in his pocket, not a horn or     a talisman, but a publisher, in fact, ready to unearth new writers for     my old friend Mr Henderson's _Young Folks_.  Even the ruthlessness of     a united family recoiled before the extreme measure of inflicting on     our guest the mutilated members of _The Sea-Cook_; at the same time,     we would by no means stop our readings, and accordingly the tale was     begun again at the beginning, and solemnly redelivered for the benefit     of Dr Japp.  From that moment on, I have thought highly of his     critical faculty; for when he left us, he carried away the manuscript     in his portmanteau.       \"_Treasure Island_--it was Mr Henderson who deleted the first title,     _The Sea-Cook_--appeared duly in _Young Folks_, where it figured in     the ignoble midst without woodcuts, and attracted not the least     attention.  I did not care.  I liked the tale myself, for much the     same reason as my father liked the beginning: it was my kind of     picturesque.  I was not a little proud of John Silver also; and to     this day rather admire that smooth and formidable adventurer.  What     was infinitely more exhilarating, I had passed a landmark.  I had     finished a tale and written The End upon my manuscript, as I had not     done since _The Pentland Rising_, when I was a boy of sixteen, not yet     at college.  In truth, it was so by a lucky set of accidents: had not     Dr Japp come on his visit, had not the tale flowed from me with     singular ease, it must have been laid aside, like its predecessors,     and found a circuitous and unlamented way to the fire.  Purists may     suggest it would have been better so.  I am not of that mind.  The     tale seems to have given much pleasure, and it brought (or was the     means of bringing) fire, food, and wine to a deserving family in which     I took an interest.  I need scarcely say I mean my own.\"    He himself gives a goodly list of the predecessors which had found a  circuitous and unlamented way to the fire       \"As soon as I was able to write, I became a good friend to the paper-     makers.  Reams upon reams must have gone to the making of _Rathillet_,     _The Pentland Rising_, _The King's Pardon_ (otherwise _Park     Whitehead_), _Edward Daven_, _A Country Dance_, and _A Vendetta in the     West_.  _Rathillet_ was attempted before fifteen, _The Vendetta_ at     twenty-nine, and the succession of defeats lasted unbroken till I was     thirty-one.\"    Another thing I carried from Braemar with me which I greatly prize--this  was a copy of _Christianity confirmed by Jewish and Heathen Testimony_,  by Mr Stevenson's father, with his autograph signature and many of his  own marginal notes.  He had thought deeply on many subjects--theological,  scientific, and social--and had recorded, I am afraid, but the smaller  half of his thoughts and speculations.  Several days in the mornings,  before R. L. Stevenson was able to face the somewhat \"snell\" air of the  hills, I had long walks with the old gentleman, when we also had long  talks on many subjects--the liberalising of the Scottish Church,  educational reform, etc.; and, on one occasion, a statement of his  reason, because of the subscription, for never having become an elder.  That he had in some small measure enjoyed my society, as I certainly had  much enjoyed his, was borne out by a letter which I received from the son  in reply to one I had written, saying that surely his father had never  meant to present me at the last moment on my leaving by coach with that  volume, with his name on it, and with pencilled notes here and there, but  had merely given it me to read and return.  In the circumstances I may  perhaps be excused quoting from a letter dated Castleton of Braemar,  September 1881, in illustration of what I have said--       \"MY DEAR DR JAPP,--My father has gone, but I think I may take it upon     me to ask you to keep the book.  Of all things you could do to endear     yourself to me you have done the best, for, from your letter, you have     taken a fancy to my father.       \"I do not know how to thank you for your kind trouble in the matter of     _The Sea-Cook_, but I am not unmindful.  My health is still poorly,     and I have added intercostal rheumatism--a new attraction, which sewed     me up nearly double for two days, and still gives me 'a list to     starboard'--let us be ever nautical. . . . I do not think with the     start I have, there will be any difficulty in letting Mr Henderson go     ahead whenever he likes.  I will write my story up to its legitimate     conclusion, and then we shall be in a position to judge whether a     sequel would be desirable, and I myself would then know better about     its practicability from the story-telling point of view.--Yours very     sincerely, ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.\"    A little later came the following:--       \"THE COTTAGE, CASTLETON OF BRAEMAR.     (_No date_.)       \"MY DEAR DR JAPP,--Herewith go nine chapters.  I have been a little     seedy; and the two last that I have written seem to me on a false     venue; hence the smallness of the batch.  I have now, I hope, in the     three last sent, turned the corner, with no great amount of dulness.       \"The map, with all its names, notes, soundings, and things, should     make, I believe, an admirable advertisement for the story.  Eh?       \"I hope you got a telegram and letter I forwarded after you to     Dinnat.--Believe me, yours very sincerely, ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.\"    In the afternoon, if fine and dry, we went walking, and Stevenson would  sometimes tell us stories of his short experience at the Scottish Bar,  and of his first and only brief.  I remember him contrasting that with  his experiences as an engineer with Bob Bain, who, as manager, was then  superintending the building of a breakwater.  Of that time, too, he told  the choicest stories, and especially of how, against all orders, he  bribed Bob with five shillings to let him go down in the diver's dress.  He gave us a splendid description--finer, I think, than even that in his  _Memories_--of his sensations on the sea-bottom, which seems to have  interested him as deeply, and suggested as many strange fancies, as  anything which he ever came across on the surface.  But the possibility  of enterprises of this sort ended--Stevenson lost his interest in  engineering.    {Manuscript letter by R.L.S.: p20.jpg}    Stevenson's father had, indeed, been much exercised in his day by  theological questions and difficulties, and though he remained a staunch  adherent of the Established Church of Scotland he knew well and  practically what is meant by the term \"accommodation,\" as it is used by  theologians in reference to creeds and formulas; for he had over and over  again, because of the strict character of the subscription required from  elders of the Scottish Church declined, as I have said, to accept the  office.  In a very express sense you could see that he bore the marks of  his past in many ways--a quick, sensitive, in some ways even a fantastic-  minded man, yet with a strange solidity and common-sense amid it all,  just as though ferns with the veritable fairies' seed were to grow out of  a common stone wall.  He looked like a man who had not been without  sleepless nights--without troubles, sorrows, and perplexities, and even  yet, had not wholly risen above some of them, or the results of them.  His  voice was \"low and sweet\"--with just a possibility in it of rising to a  shrillish key.  A sincere and faithful man, who had walked very demurely  through life, though with a touch of sudden, bright, quiet humour and  fancy, every now and then crossing the grey of his characteristic  pensiveness or melancholy, and drawing effect from it.  He was most frank  and genial with me, and I greatly honour his memory. {2}    Thomas Stevenson, with a strange, sad smile, told me how much of a  disappointment, in the first stage, at all events, Louis (he always  called his son Louis at home), had caused him, by failing to follow up  his profession at the Scottish Bar.  How much he had looked forward,  after the engineering was abandoned, to his devoting himself to the work  of the Parliament House (as the Hall of the Chief Court is called in  Scotland, from the building having been while yet there was a Scottish  Parliament the place where it sat), though truly one cannot help feeling  how much Stevenson's very air and figure would have been out of keeping  among the bewigged, pushing, sharp-set, hard-featured, and even red-faced  and red-nosed (some of them, at any rate) company, who daily walked the  Parliament House, and talked and gossiped there, often of other things  than law and equity.  \"Well, yes, perhaps it was all for the best,\" he  said, with a sigh, on my having interjected the remark that R. L.  Stevenson was wielding far more influence than he ever could have done as  a Scottish counsel, even though he had risen rapidly in his profession,  and become Lord-Advocate or even a judge.
