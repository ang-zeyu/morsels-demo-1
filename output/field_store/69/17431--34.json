Their letters were not like ours, but  were pictures of the things they were writing about.  They also built  huge stone tombs for their kings to be buried in, and these were  called \"pyramids.\" The kings of Egypt were called \"Pharaohs.\" When the  old Egyptians wrote books, instead of paper they used the dried leaves  of a reed called \"papyrus,\" which grows in the Nile.  Several leaves  were fastened together to make a book.  These old writings on reeds  and on the walls have been found after lying buried in the sand, which  has covered so much of old Egypt.  The hot sand has kept them dry, and  prevented them being destroyed during hundreds of years.  By reading  these writings we are able to find out how these people lived so long  ago.  They had also a wonderful way of taking the waters of the Nile  in ditches over the whole land.  There is hardly any rain in Egypt,  and this Nile water prevented the country becoming so sandy and dry.  In those days Egypt was well-known for its wonderful harvests and  stores of food.    But though these people were wise in many ways, yet they were proud  and cruel to their enemies.  In the Bible we read how they treated the  Children of Israel in the time of Moses.  Perhaps this was because  they did not know God our Father, but worshipped many gods, whose  pictures and images were like animals.  Many of the great temples they  built for these gods are still standing, and when we see pictures of  them, we wonder at the skill of these people who lived so long ago.  Egypt was one of the first great countries to become Christian, and  many of the old heathen temples were turned into churches.  But at  last the Arabs, who were Mohammedans, conquered Egypt, and forced most  of the people to become Mohammedans too.  But some remained faithful  in spite of all, and these to-day are called \"Copts,\" from the old  name for Egypt.  For hundreds of years these Copts have lived in a  country ruled by Moslem Arabs, or Turks, who hated their religion, but  they have been true to Christ through all.    There are people of all lands living in the towns of Egypt in these  days, for there is a great deal of business to be done in them.  But  the people who work in the fields are the children of the old  Egyptians, though they have forgotten their old wisdom and are now  very ignorant.                            3. The People of Egypt    The Egyptians are a race different both from the dark-skinned people  of Africa and from Europeans.  They have olive skins, very dark,  almond-shaped eyes, and dark, straight hair.  Most of the men shave  their heads, and wear a turban or tarboosh as a covering.  The women  fasten a veil below their eyes, which falls over the lower part of  their face.  Both the men and the women wear several loose garments,  which cover the whole body from the neck to the feet.  All except the  very poor wear shoes.    In the towns there are a great many people, some very rich and others  very poor.  Often a city looks very beautiful, because the houses are  built of white or light-coloured stone or brick.  But they are close  together, and the streets are very narrow and dirty, and so the poor  people are often ill.  The houses are built in \"storeys,\" one room on  the top of another, with steps leading to the upper rooms.  Often  there is a courtyard in the middle of the house, so that all the rooms  can have windows and light.  One part of the house is separated from  the rest for the women to use.  This is called the \"hareem,\" and no  man, except the master of the house, is allowed to go into it.  All  rich Mohammedans have a separate part of their house for the women.  A  poor woman in all countries has plenty of work to do, but a rich lady  in Egypt has many servants, or slaves, to do the work, and, as she is  kept shut up in the \"hareem\" from the time she is ten or eleven years  old, she can learn very little, except how to do beautiful needlework.  She cannot help her husband and her sons to be wise and good, because  she does not know enough about life and work outside the \"hareem.\" So  the Egyptian ladies have little to do and little to think about all  the day while their husbands are away, and they are often very dull.  But the town-people love their children very much, and Egyptian  children are taught always to love, honour, and obey their father and  mother.  An Egyptian man may have four wives, but generally he has  only one.    Until a few years ago, all Egyptians who had enough money used to buy  slaves to do their work.  Slaves could be bought or sold, or married  or given away, as if they were things instead of people.  Masters  could illtreat or even kill their slaves and not be punished, because  it was only as if they had broken their water-jar in a temper, and  that was no one else's business.  Often slaves were happy if they had  good masters, but it is a bad custom to take away a person's freedom  and treat him as if he had no soul.  During the last few years many  Europeans have been helping the Egyptians to improve their country,  and one of the changes has been to do away gradually with slavery.  No  one is now allowed to buy a slave, and anyone born in slavery can  become free if he wishes to do so.  Instead of slaves, people now have  servants who receive wages for their work.  These are free to leave  their master if he does not treat them well.  Although slavery is  dying out of Egypt, there are other parts of North Africa where the  old bad customs still exist, though the great European nations try to  prevent the public markets for slaves being held.  People are happiest  in countries where there are no slaves and everyone is free to do the  work for which he is best fitted.    In Egyptian households where there is more than one wife there is  often quarrelling.  The wives of one man all live in one \"hareem,\" and  cannot help being jealous if they see their husband likes one better  than another.  Then there is quarrelling and ill-will among them.  As  the children grow up there is a further cause for jealousy, because  the mothers of boys are more important than those who have only  girl-children.  Children cannot respect their mothers if they often  see them quarrelling and jealous.  Again, there is always a  possibility that a husband may divorce his wife.  He is not likely to  do so if she has a boy-baby, but until she has, her position as a wife  is not very secure.  These bad marriage customs lead to much  unhappiness, and prevent the women of Egypt from doing so much good as  the women of some other lands are able to do.  We must not, of course,  think that all Egyptian homes are unhappy; probably many poor women  are quite glad when their husband brings another wife to help with the  work.  But where servants do the work, there are only the pleasures of  the home to be shared, and then jealousy will be likely to come.                               4. The Big Towns    If we went for a walk in the narrow streets of an Egyptian city or big  town, we should see on either side open shops, each with its owner  ready to sell his goods.  Many of the people of the towns have shops  or trades.  They sell jewellery, furniture, cloth, and everything that  is wanted in the house for cooking.  In the streets there are some men  carrying drinking-water for sale, because it is hot walking about and  people get thirsty.  Others will be selling sweet-stuff made of sugar,  which everyone likes.  Others wait about ready to write letters for  people who cannot write for themselves, and there are always many  beggars.  Great steamers from other countries--England, France, India,  Japan--bring merchandise to Alexandria and Port Said, the seaports of  Egypt, and so people from these countries have shops and offices in  those towns.  Then the goods are taken by boats or trains to the  capital, Cairo, where the Sultan lives, and to other large towns.  In  all these towns there are hundreds of people, so that a man can only  know those who live near him or work with him.  Most of them are  unknown to one another and are like strangers, although they all live  in one town and can all speak Arabic.                           5. Life in the Villages    The country-people of Egypt are very poor, and have to work very hard  all the year round in their fields.  Their houses are built of bricks  dried in the sun, plastered together with mud, and the roof is made of  plaited palm leaf.  Inside there is only one room, which has a big  oven made of mud with a flat top on which the father and mother sleep.  The work in the fields is very hard, as the ground has to be made  fertile by digging canals and ditches all over it to bring the water  from the Nile, because, you remember, there is no rain in Egypt.  When  the Nile begins to fall, the water has to be raised in baskets  fastened to a wheel or pole, and thrown on the ground.  In order to  get enough money, the people plant another kind of seed as soon as one  harvest is gathered; first, perhaps, planting wheat, then millet, or  cotton, then maize.  So the country-people in Egypt are always working  hard from sunrise to sunset all the year in their fields, and their  little children have to learn to mind sheep, goats, or cattle, and to  help in other ways as soon as they can walk alone.    Other men work on the Nile, carrying people or goods up and down the  river in boats from place to place.  This, again, is hard work, but  the boatmen seem very happy and often sing as they pass along.  People  in the country villages are ignorant, and very few can read or write.  Sometimes when the harvest has been bad and food is dear and scarce,  the people get deeply into debt.  There is a great deal of illness and  disease, but there are very few doctors and nurses to help people to  get well.  So the life of an Egyptian peasant is a hard one--a great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6702"],[0,"Life of Harriet Beecher Stowe (#3)"],[1,"with great zeal and earnestness, she called to him to  know what he was doing. Lifting his curly head, he answered with great  simplicity, 'Why, I'm going to heaven to find mamma.'    \"Although our mother's bodily presence thus disappeared from our  circle, I think her memory and example had more influence in moulding  her family, in deterring from evil and exciting to good, than  the living presence of many mothers. It was a memory that met us  everywhere, for every person in the town, from the highest to the  lowest, seemed to have been so impressed by her character and life that  they constantly reflected some portion of it back upon us.    \"The passage in 'Uncle Tom' where Augustine St. Clare describes  his mother's influence is a simple reproduction of my own mother's  influence as it has always been felt in her family.\"    Of his deceased wife Dr. Beecher said: \"Few women have attained to  more remarkable piety. Her faith was strong and her prayer prevailing.  It was her wish that all her sons should devote themselves to the  ministry, and to it she consecrated them with fervent prayer. Her  prayers have been heard. All her sons have been converted and are now,  according to her wish, ministers of Christ.\"    Such was Roxanna Beecher, whose influence upon her four-year-old  daughter was strong enough to mould the whole after-life of the author  of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" After the mother's death the Litchfield home  was such a sad, lonely place for the child that her aunt, Harriet  Foote, took her away for a long visit at her grandmother's at Nut  Plains, near Guilford, Conn., the first journey from home the little  one had ever made. Of this visit Mrs. Stowe herself says:--    \"Among my earliest recollections are those of a visit to Nut Plains  immediately after my mother's death. Aunt Harriet Foote, who was with  mother during all her last sickness, took me home to stay with her.  At the close of what seemed to me a long day's ride we arrived after  dark at a lonely little white farmhouse, and were ushered into a large  parlor where a cheerful wood fire was crackling. I was placed in the  arms of an old lady, who held me close and wept silently, a thing at  which I marveled, for my great loss was already faded from my childish  mind.    [Illustration: _Roxanna Foote_]    \"I remember being put to bed by my aunt in a large room, on one side  of which stood the bed appropriated to her and me, and on the other  that of my grandmother. My aunt Harriet was no common character. A more  energetic human being never undertook the education of a child. Her  ideas of education were those of a vigorous English woman of the old  school. She believed in the Church, and had she been born under that  _regime_ would have believed in the king stoutly, although being of the  generation following the Revolution she was a not less stanch supporter  of the Declaration of Independence.    \"According to her views little girls were to be taught to move very  gently, to speak softly and prettily, to say 'yes ma'am,' and 'no  ma'am,' never to tear their clothes, to sew, to knit at regular hours,  to go to church on Sunday and make all the responses, and to come home  and be catechised.    \"During these catechisings she used to place my little cousin Mary  and myself bolt upright at her knee, while black Dinah and Harry, the  bound boy, were ranged at a respectful distance behind us; for Aunt  Harriet always impressed it upon her servants 'to order themselves  lowly and reverently to all their betters,' a portion of the Church  catechism that always pleased me, particularly when applied to them, as  it insured their calling me 'Miss Harriet,' and treating me with a  degree of consideration such as I never enjoyed in the more democratic  circle at home. I became proficient in the Church catechism, and gave  my aunt great satisfaction by the old-fashioned gravity and steadiness  with which I learned to repeat it.    \"As my father was a Congregational minister, I believe Aunt Harriet,  though the highest of High Church women, felt some scruples as  to whether it was desirable that my religious education should  be entirely out of the sphere of my birth. Therefore when this  catechetical exercise was finished she would say, 'Now, niece, you  have to learn another catechism, because your father is a Presbyterian  minister,'--and then she would endeavor to make me commit to memory the  Assembly catechism.    \"At this lengthening of exercise I secretly murmured. I was rather  pleased at the first question in the Church catechism, which is  certainly quite on the level of any child's understanding,--'What is  your name?' It was such an easy good start, I could say it so loud and  clear, and I was accustomed to compare it with the first question in  the Primer, 'What is the chief end of man?' as vastly more difficult  for me to answer. In fact, between my aunt's secret unbelief and my own  childish impatience of too much catechism, the matter was indefinitely  postponed after a few ineffectual attempts, and I was overjoyed to hear  her announce privately to grandmother that she thought it would be time  enough for Harriet to learn the Presbyterian catechism when she went  home.\"    Mingled with this superabundance of catechism and plentiful needlework  the child was treated to copious extracts from Lowth's Isaiah,  Buchanan's Researches in Asia, Bishop Heber's Life, and Dr. Johnson's  Works, which, after her Bible and Prayer Book, were her grandmother's  favorite reading. Harriet does not seem to have fully appreciated  these; but she did enjoy her grandmother's comments upon their biblical  readings. Among the Evangelists especially was the old lady perfectly  at home, and her idea of each of the apostles was so distinct and  dramatic that she spoke of them as of familiar acquaintances. She  would, for instance, always smile indulgently at Peter's remarks and  say, \"There he is again, now; that's just like Peter. He's always so  ready to put in.\"    It must have been during this winter spent at Nut Plains, amid such  surroundings, that Harriet began committing to memory that wonderful  assortment of hymns, poems, and scriptural passages from which in after  years she quoted so readily and effectively, for her sister Catherine,  in writing of her the following November, says:--    \"Harriet is a very good girl. She has been to school all this summer,  and has learned to read very fluently. She has committed to memory  twenty-seven hymns and two long chapters in the Bible. She has a  remarkably retentive memory and will make a very good scholar.\"    At this time the child was five years old, and a regular attendant  at \"Ma'am Kilbourne's\" school on West Street, to which she walked  every day hand in hand with her chubby, rosy-faced, bare-footed,  four-year-old brother, Henry Ward. With the ability to read germinated  the intense literary longing that was to be hers through life. In  those days but few books were specially prepared for children, and  at six years of age we find the little girl hungrily searching for  mental food amid barrels of old sermons and pamphlets stored in a  corner of the garret. Here it seemed to her were some thousands of the  most unintelligible things. \"An appeal on the unlawfulness of a man  marrying his wife's sister\" turned up in every barrel she investigated,  by twos, or threes, or dozens, till her soul despaired of finding an  end. At last her patient search was rewarded, for at the very bottom  of a barrel of musty sermons she discovered an ancient volume of  \"The Arabian Nights.\" With this her fortune was made, for in these  most fascinating of fairy tales the imaginative child discovered a  well-spring of joy that was all her own. When things went astray with  her, when her brothers started off on long excursions, refusing to take  her with them, or in any other childish sorrow, she had only to curl  herself up in some snug corner and sail forth on her bit of enchanted  carpet into fairyland to forget all her griefs.    In recalling her own child-life Mrs. Stowe, among other things,  describes her father's library, and gives a vivid bit of her own  experiences within its walls. She says: \"High above all the noise of  the house, this room had to me the air of a refuge and a sanctuary. Its  walls were set round from floor to ceiling with the friendly, quiet  faces of books, and there stood my father's great writing-chair, on one  arm of which lay open always his Cruden's Concordance and his Bible.  Here I loved to retreat and niche myself down in a quiet corner with my  favorite books around me. I had a kind of sheltered feeling as I thus  sat and watched my father writing, turning to his books, and speaking  from time to time to himself in a loud, earnest whisper. I vaguely felt  that he was about some holy and mysterious work quite beyond my little  comprehension, and I was careful never to disturb him by question or  remark.    [Illustration: BIRTHPLACE AT LITCHFIELD, CONNECTICUT.]    \"The books ranged around filled me too with a solemn awe. On the  lower shelves were enormous folios, on whose backs I spelled in black  letters, 'Lightfoot Opera,' a title whereat I wondered, considering  the bulk of the volumes. Above these, grouped along in friendly,  social rows, were books of all sorts, sizes, and bindings, the titles  of which I had read so often that I knew them by heart. There were  Bell's Sermons, Bonnett's Inquiries, Bogue's Essays, Toplady on  Predestination, Boston's Fourfold State, Law's Serious Call, and other  works of that kind. These I looked over wistfully, day after day,  without even a hope of getting something interesting out of them. The  thought that father could read and understand things like these filled  me with a vague awe, and I wondered if I would ever be old enough to  know what it was all about.    \"But there was one of my father's books that proved a mine of wealth  to"]]]
