She is tired. One night more! I will send her  to you with Filippo in the morning.\"    Guiseppe shook his head.    \"The bargain's closed. Quick, get her clothes, we must be off.\"    \"She is ready as she stands,\" said Pietro, pointing to Pappina, who  stood holding tightly to her mother.    \"What, no clothes!\" cried Guiseppe harshly.    Elisa looked angrily at him.    Guiseppe, anxious to get away, went to Pappina and rested his hand on  her head with a show of tenderness.    \"Come, little one, come,\" he said, \"and to-morrow you shall buy a  splendid dress, bright and new.\"    Pappina was interested.    \"Will you take me to the Toledo, where all the lords and ladies are?\"  she asked.    \"_Si, si, carina_ [yes, yes, little dear],\" said Guiseppe guilefully.    \"Go with him, _bambina_. It is best,\" said Pietro, trying to disguise  his fears and hide his sorrow.    Pappina, taught always to obey her parents, hesitated no longer.    \"I'm ready,\" she said, leaving her mother's side.    There were no preparations to make for the child's departure, no  clothes to fold and pack. All she owned she was wearing. She had  only to bid adieu to the loved ones before starting out with Guiseppe  Capasso into the street, into a new life.    Elisa, wringing her hands and with tears raining down her cheeks,  watched her most beautiful child disappear into the dusk. Her grief  would have been wilder still had she known the truth--for Pappina was  leaving San Lucia forever.              On thy dear head my hands I lay            In solemn, fervent prayer,            Praying that God may keep thee            Thus pure and sweet and fair.                                     --_Heine._                                        CHAPTER II                           THE CONQUEST OF GUISEPPE      When Pappina awoke the next morning, the little east room where she lay  was flooded with sunshine. She looked about her wonderingly.    \"Where am I? Is this a dream?\" she asked herself softly.    For a few moments she lay with half-closed, sleepy eyes looking in the  golden light at the white curtains draped at the window.    \"Pretty, pretty,\" she murmured. Her little hand took up the coverlet.  It was white! She turned over quickly: there was a white covering on  her pillow! Surely this was not home! She sat up, rubbing her eyes, and  there was brown-haired Marta smiling at her from the other side of the  room.    Marta was an Englishwoman. While traveling through Italy as maid to  the Countess Filota, she had met and fallen in love with the handsome  professional story-teller, Guiseppe Capasso. After their marriage he  had turned his stock of stories to account by setting up as a puppet  showman.    Marta knew how to take care of a child. Her English face shone with  pleasure as she washed Pappina, combed her hair, and dressed her, clean  and rested, for breakfast.    This home was poor. The furnishings were little better than those of  Pappina's own, but it was clean. Pappina looked about the room.    \"I like it,\" she said.    She had just finished the simple breakfast Marta served when Guiseppe  appeared, frowning, in the doorway.    The gladness went out of Marta's eyes as though a cloud had passed  before the sun.    Pappina noticed his scowl and was half frightened for a moment. She  clung close to Marta, waiting for Guiseppe to speak.    From under his heavy, shaggy eyebrows he stood silently studying the  face of the black-eyed child. Pappina flushed under his scrutiny. She  wanted to cry, but she was not lacking in spirit and she did not mean  to let him know that he frightened her.    \"Signor, why don't you say good-morning to Pappina?\" she asked. \"I  shan't like you if you look so cross.\"    Guiseppe was surprised at the speech and pleased at her courage. Most  children ran away from him when he scowled and looked fiercely at them,  as he knew he had looked at Pappina. To Maria's astonishment he burst  into a hearty laugh.    \"I'm good and I'm cross, _bambina_. I'm clouds and I'm sunshine.  Sometimes I'll be kind. Sometimes, maybe, I'll beat you.\"    \"No, you won't,\" retorted Pappina, darting from Marta's side. \"Oh, no,  signor! If you should dare, I'd run away from you.\"    Guiseppe believed her when he saw her small clenched fists and the fire  of indignation in her eyes. He knew she meant what she said.    \"_Hola_, the sauce box! I'll break her in! I'll curb her spirit by  degrees,\" he told himself, smiling as though he enjoyed the prospect.  Bowing with great courtliness, he said aloud: \"Ah, a very beautiful  morning to you, Madamigella Pappina.\"    Pappina stood still a moment, watching him; then, with a shrug of her  shoulders, she replied    \"_Ebbene_ [Well]! But you have not told me, signor--\"    \"Call me, Guiseppe,\" the man interrupted. \"We're just old Guiseppe and  Marta to every one.\"    \"Well, then, old Guiseppe--\"    \"Guiseppe, without the old, if you please, signorina.\" He bowed  mockingly, but he smiled as though the child's independence and  fearlessness had charmed his surliness away.    \"Signor Guiseppe, you have not told me at what time you will take me to  the Toledo. I want the new dress you promised to buy me to-day.\"    Marta held her breath. Would Guiseppe, who had led her such a hard life  for years, permit this child to look boldly into his face and command  him to do her bidding? Would he suddenly burst into a rage and rain  blows upon her?    To her relief she saw a half-concealed smile on his lips as he took  from his pocket a handful of money. He counted out a few pieces and  laid them on the table.    \"Marta, buy the minx stuff for a dress--and shoes, too, I suppose. We  can't have her toes sticking out as they are now,\" he said.    \"And stockings?\" asked Marta with a courage she could never have  summoned had she been asking for money for herself.    \"She'll do without them,\" Guiseppe replied grimly. \"If her feet are  covered she'll get along. I'll go alone with the Punchinellos this  morning. This afternoon I'll keep my promise and take the child to the  Toledo, although why she's so crazy to go there is more than I know.\"    Taking up his Punchinello box, he left the room.    Pappina danced about, radiantly happy over the prospect of a new frock.    \"You'll let me go with you, won't you, Marta? I want so to go, and if  there's money enough. Marta--dear, good Marta--may I have some of that  stuff that smells like flowers? I smelt it on those foreign ladies when  they took out their handkerchiefs at the Marina.\"    \"There'll be only enough for the dress and the shoes to-day, _carina_.\"  Marta was sorry to deny the child.    Pappina took the woman's hand.    \"_Vieni_, Marta. We must hurry or everything will be sold to the  foreigners. They have so much money they even throw it away. My dress  must be red, and red is so beautiful! If we don't hurry. I'm sure  they'll have it all. Please, Marta, aren't you ready?\"    Marta had not the heart to keep the eager child waiting, and they  started at once.    [Illustration: It was not they]    Pappina walked as though on air, by Marta's side, looking at  everything, prattling in her inimitable way. Marta was beginning to  feel that even for herself life still held some charm.    The child had not once thought of home. She had been too absorbed in  the newness of everything. Suddenly she caught sight of two ragged boys  asleep on the ground, with their empty baskets over their faces. She  stopped beside them.    \"Marta, wait!\" she commanded. \"Maybe it's Vittorio or Filippo.  Sometimes they don't come home at night. I must see if it is my  brothers.\"    A passer-by, hearing her cry, uncovered the boys' heads. Eagerly  Pappina peered into their faces. It was not they. She burst into tears.    \"_Padre_--_madre_ [Father--mother]!--I want to see them all! Take me  home,\" she cried.    \"First the pretty red dress, _carina_.\" Shrewd Marta! She knew perhaps  the one thing to make the child forget.    The tears were dried, and hand in hand they hurried to a shop. Pappina  wanted everything she saw in the store that was bright and pretty.    \"Mayn't I have that shawl for my head? Please, Marta, buy it for me!\"    \"No, _carina_--just the dress and shoes to-day. There is money only for  them.\"    Pappina's request was hardly made before she had forgotten it because  of the wonders she beheld in the great store--show-cases filled with  ribbons of all the colors and tints of the rainbow; cases of spools of  silk; bright-colored fashion plates, and a dazzling array of fabrics in  prints, cheesecloth, merinos, and silks. With exclamations of delight  the child danced about like a butterfly from one thing to another,  smiling Marta following her.    When they started from the shop, Pappina refused to let Marta carry  either the shoes or the dressgoods. She hugged them close in her  arms, every other minute peeping through the tear she had made in the  wrapping-paper.    \"_Che bella, Marta, che bella_ [How beautiful, Marta, how beautiful]!\"  she exclaimed softly, again and again.    \"Are we going to make the dress right away, the minute we get home,  Marta?\"    \"_Si, si, carina._\"    \"You will let me help?\"    \"Can you sew, _carina_?\"    \"My sister Angela knit when she was only four, and I can sew, I'm sure  I can. You'll let me, won't you, Marta?--so it will be done before I go  with Signor Guiseppe?\"    \"You shall wear it this afternoon, _carina_.\"    \"He'll be sure to like the color of the dress. He can't help it, can  he? Shan't I be grand, Marta, when I have on my splendid new dress and  shoes!\"    Marta, looking at the eager little upturned face, forgot she had ever  had a sorrow or a hardship.    It did not take long to sew up the simple little frock, but it would  certainly have been finished quite an hour before had not Pappina  insisted upon sewing this and that. Marta, good "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45573"],[0,"Out with Garibaldi: A story of the liberation of Italy (#3)"],[1,"went to Rome, without any idea of staying there more  than a year. His plans, however, were changed when he met and fell in  love with Muriel, the only child of Professor Forli, a man of almost  European reputation for his learning and attainments. His wooing had  been an uneventful one. His income was amply sufficient, in the  professor's eyes, to keep his daughter in comfort, and, moreover, the  master under whom Leonard was studying gave an excellent account of his  ability and industry, and in 1842 the marriage took place. Previous to  this Leonard had obtained his father's consent to his intended marriage,  although not his approval.    \"I consider that it is one more piece of folly,\" he wrote. \"There was no  reason in the world why you should not have settled at home and made a  good marriage. I had specially hoped that this would have been the case,  as Tom still remains a bachelor. However, there are some redeeming  points in the matter. I have, through a friend, who is a member of the  Athenaeum, learned that Professor Forli's name is well known, and that he  is considered one of the most learned men in Italy. In the next place,  the young lady's mother is, as you have told me, an Englishwoman of good  family, and her daughter is therefore only half an Italian. From your  description of her, allowing for the usual exaggeration in such cases,  she takes after her mother, and might pass anywhere as of unmixed  English blood, so I may hope that I shall not have black-haired, swarthy  little grandchildren running about. I shall add a couple of hundred a  year to your allowance, as I always intended to do when you married.\"    A year later Captain Percival brought his wife home to England, and  stayed there for some time; and here a son was born, who was christened  Frank, after his grandfather. Whatever objections the latter might at  first have felt to his son's marriage, they were altogether removed by  this visit; neither in appearance nor in speech did his wife betray her  foreign origin, for her mother had always conversed with her in English,  and she spoke it without the slightest accent. She was now twenty, was  strikingly handsome, and very graceful in her movements. He would gladly  have kept her and his son with him; but when they had consented to her  marriage, her parents had bargained that she should, at any rate, spend  a large portion of her time with them, as they had no other children.  Moreover, her husband was now devoted to art, and although he had only  been working for two years, his pictures were already beginning to  attract attention.    Mr. Percival was, therefore, obliged to content himself with the promise  that they would come over every year for at least four months. The  arrangement, however, was not carried out, for, a few months after their  return to Italy, Mr. Percival died suddenly. His death made no  difference pecuniarily to his son, as he had settled upon him a sum  sufficient to produce an income equal to that which he had before been  allowed. His elder brother came out a year later, and stayed for a few  weeks with him.    \"You must send this little chap over to England to be educated,  Leonard,\" he had said, \"if you will persist in sticking in this rotten  old city. I don't suppose I shall ever marry; and if not, of course some  day he will come in for the property.\"    \"But why on earth shouldn't you marry, Tom? You know what a trouble it  was to our father that you did not do so--it was a real grievance to  him.\"    \"Well, I should really have been glad to oblige him; but somehow or  other I never saw any girl whom I earnestly desired to make my wife, or,  as I suppose you would call it, fell in love with. I very much prefer  knocking about in my yacht, or travelling, to settling down. Of course I  always spent a month or two, twice a year, at my father's, and was in  town three months in the season--that is to say, when I did not get sick  of it. Then I either went up the Mediterranean or to the West Indies, or  knocked about round England for three or four months, and finished the  year with a run up the Nile, or out to India or China. Now I feel even  less inclined to marry than I did before, for if I did, it would simply  mean eight months in the year down in the country, and four in London.  Of course, if I ever do fall in love--and at forty it is hardly  likely--I shall marry; I don't bind myself in any way to remain single.  Anyhow, I am glad that you are married, and that, when I go, there will  be another Frank Percival, who we must hope will be of a more settled  disposition than either of us, to reign in the old place.\"    So things had gone on quietly until, in 1848, the revolution in Paris  was followed by an upheaval all over Europe. The ascent of Pius IX. to  the papal chair was hailed by the liberal party in Italy as the  commencement of a new era. He was accredited, and not unjustly, with  liberal views, and it was believed that he would introduce reforms into  the Papal States, and act as a centre round which patriots could rally.  Unfortunately, the party of reform in Italy was divided into two  classes; of one of these the Marquis d'Azeglio was the leading spirit;  he was a moderate reformer, and looked to a union of Italy under a  constitutional monarch. Carlo Alberto, the King of Sardinia, seemed to  him the only man who could assume that position, and for years d'Azeglio  had worked quietly to this end.    A more violent spirit was however working with as much zeal and energy  in another direction. Mazzini was an extreme republican of the narrowest  kind; he was in communication with men of the same type in France, and  had formed secret societies all over Italy. He and those with him were  anxious to obtain the countenance and prestige which a Pope of advanced  liberal opinions would give to their party, and Pius IX. was received  with enthusiastic acclamations by the republican party of Rome. But,  liberally inclined as he was, he shrank from committing himself wholly  to the reformers. He was a weak man; and although his vanity was  gratified by his reception, and although he had sincerely desired to  introduce broad reforms, he hesitated when called upon to carry those  reforms into action. The King of Sardinia had been pushed forward by the  Mazzinians, until he compromised himself, and made advances to the Pope,  when in 1847 Austria violated the Papal territories at Ferrara. But the  Pope hesitated. His army was already near the frontier; but he declared  that he had no intention of making war, and desired only to protect his  territory.    The news of the movement had reached Monte Video; and Garibaldi,  believing that the Pope would stand forth as the champion for the  freedom of Italy, wrote, offering his services and those of his  followers, the greater part of whom were Italians who had been exiled  for their political opinions. No answer was received from him; and  Garibaldi took the matter into his own hands, and with eighty-five  Italians sailed for Europe. On arriving at Alicante he learned that a  revolution had broken out in Paris, that Carlo Alberto had given his  people a constitution, that Lombardy and Venice had risen, that the  Milanese had driven the Austrians out of the city, that there were  insurrections in Vienna and Berlin, that Tuscany and Rome were sending  thousands of volunteers to fight in the national cause, and that even  Ferdinand of Naples had promised his people a constitution. Garibaldi  was unavoidably detained for some time at Nice, his native town, and  before he was able to move a change had set in.    The Lombards and Venetians had both quarrelled among themselves.  Mazzini's party were struggling against those who would have made Carlo  Alberto King of Italy. The Piedmontese, after brilliant successes at  first, were obliged to retreat. The Roman volunteers had been forced to  capitulate. Garibaldi went to see the king, and offer to act with his  volunteers in his service; but his application was slighted, and this  threw him into the hands of the revolutionary party. It was a grievous  mistake on the part of the king; but the latter could not forget that  Garibaldi had been a rebel against him, nor could Garibaldi forget that  it was the king who had sentenced him to death and had sent him into  exile. He therefore hurried to Milan, where he was received with  enthusiasm. The king moved to the aid of Milan, against which the  Austrians were advancing; but in that city the party of Mazzini was  predominant, and they refused to open the gates to him; and early in  August the king came to terms with the Austrians, and Milan surrendered.    For a time Garibaldi's following alone maintained the war. Carrying on a  guerilla warfare, he, with fifteen hundred men, was surrounded by five  thousand Austrians, but he effected a marvellous retreat, and retired  into Switzerland. Here he was taken ill, and was forced to rest for some  months. He then went to Genoa. The extraordinary skill and bravery which  he had shown during the campaign induced the King of Sardinia to offer  him the rank of general in his army, that being the grade that he had  held in Monte Video. But Garibaldi refused, and with two hundred and  fifty volunteers started for Venice, which was besieged by the  Austrians. On hearing, however, of the rising in Rome and the flight of  the Pope--who had now abandoned his liberal professions, and had thrown  himself into the hands of Austria--Garibaldi changed his course, and his  ranks being swollen as he marched along, he arrived at Rome at the head  of fifteen hundred men. Here he met his comrade in the struggle at Rio  and Monte Video.    During his six years' residence in Rome Captain Percival had imbibed  that hatred of the Austrians and detestation of the despotisms under  which the Italian States groaned, that was felt by all with whom he came  in contact, his father-in-law,"]]]
