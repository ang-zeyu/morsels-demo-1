So as long as he was in sight of Jimmy Skunk, he  swaggered along quite as if he was used to traveling about, without any  snug house to go to at night. But right down in his heart Johnny Chuck  didn't feel half so bold as he pretended.    You see, not since he was a little Chuck and had run away from old  Mother Chuck with Peter Rabbit, had he ever been very far from his own  door-step. He had always been content to grow fat and roly-poly right  near his own home, and listen to the tales of the great world from Jimmy  Skunk and Peter Rabbit and Bobby Coon and Unc' Billy Possum, all of whom  are great travelers.    But now, here he was, actually setting forth, and without a home to come  back to! You see, he had made up his mind that no matter what happened,  he wouldn't come back, after having given his house to Jimmy Skunk.    When he had reached a place where he thought Jimmy Skunk couldn't see  him, Johnny Chuck turned and looked back, and a queer little feeling  seemed to make a lump that filled his throat and choked him. The fact  is, Johnny Chuck already began to feel homesick. But he swallowed very  hard and tried to make himself think that he was having a splendid time.  He stopped looking back and started on, and as he tramped along, he  tried to sing a song he had once heard Jimmy Skunk sing:        \"The world may stretch full far and wide--       What matters that to me?       I'll tramp it up; I'll tramp it down!       For I am bold and free.\"    It was a very brave little song, but Johnny Chuck didn't feel half so  brave and bold as he tried to think he did. Already he was beginning to  wonder where he should spend the night. Then he thought of old Whitetail  the Marshhawk, who had given him such a fright and had so nearly caught  him when he was a little fellow. The thought made him look around  hastily, and there was old Whitetail himself, sailing back and forth  hungrily just ahead of him. A great fear took possession of Johnny  Chuck, and he made himself as flat as possible in the grass, for there  was no place to hide. He made up his mind that anyway he would fight.    Nearer and nearer came old Whitetail! Finally he passed right over  Johnny Chuck. But he didn't offer to touch him. Indeed, it seemed to  Johnny that old Whitetail actually grinned and winked at him. And right  then all his fear left him.    \"Pooh!\" said Johnny Chuck scornfully. \"Who's afraid of him!\" He suddenly  realized that he was no longer a helpless little Chuck who couldn't take  care of himself, but big and strong, with sharp teeth with which his old  enemy had no mind to make a closer acquaintance, when there were mice  and snakes to be caught without fighting. So he puffed out his chest and  went on, and actually began to enjoy himself, and almost wished for a  chance to show how big and strong he was.          VII. JOHNNY'S FIRST ADVENTURE      After old Whitetail the Marshhawk passed Johnny Chuck without offering  to touch him, Johnny began to feel very brave and bold and important. He  strutted and swaggered along as much as his short legs would let him.  He held his head very high. Already he felt that he had had an adventure  and he longed for more. He forgot the terrible lonesome feeling of a  little while before. He forgot that he had given away the only home he  had. He didn't know just why, but right down deep inside he had a sudden  feeling that he really didn't care a thing about that old home. In fact,  he felt as if he wouldn't care if he never had another home. Yes, Sir,  that is the way that Johnny Chuck felt. Do you know why? Just because he  had just begun to realize how big and strong he really was.    Now it is a splendid thing to feel big and strong and brave, a very  splendid thing! But it is a bad thing to let that feeling turn to pride,  foolish pride. Of course old Whitetail hadn't really been afraid of  Johnny Chuck. He had simply passed Johnny with a wink, because there  was plenty to eat without the trouble of fighting, and Whitetail doesn't  fight just for the fun of it.    But foolish Johnny Chuck really thought that old Whitetail was afraid of  him. The more he thought about it, the more tickled he felt and the more  puffed up he felt. He began to talk to himself and to brag. Yes, Sir,  Johnny Chuck began to brag:       \"I'm not afraid of any one;       They're all afraid of me!       I only have to show my teeth       To make them turn and flee!\"    \"Pooh!\" said a voice. \"Pooh! It would take two like you to make me run  away!\"    Johnny Chuck gave a startled jump. There was a strange Chuck glaring at  him from behind a little bunch of grass. He was a big, gray old Chuck  whom Johnny never had seen on the Green Meadows before, and he didn't  look the least bit afraid. No, Sir, he didn't look the teeniest,  weeniest bit afraid! Somehow, Johnny Chuck didn't feel half so big and  strong and brave as he had a few minutes before. But it wouldn't do to  let this stranger know it. Of course not! So, though he felt very small  inside, Johnny made all his hair bristle up and tried to look very  fierce.    \"Who are you and what are you doing on my Green Meadows?\" he demanded.    \"Your Green Meadows! Your Green Meadows! Ho, ho, ho! Your Green  Meadows!\" The stranger laughed an unpleasant laugh. \"How long since you  owned the Green Meadows? I have just come down on to them from the Old  Pasture, and I like the looks of them so well that I think I will stay.  So run along, little boaster! There isn't room for both of us here, and  the sooner you trot along the better.\" The stranger suddenly showed all  his teeth and gritted them unpleasantly.    Now when Johnny Chuck heard this, great anger filled his heart. A  stranger had ordered him to leave the Green Meadows where he had been  born and always lived! He could hardly believe his own ears. He, Johnny  Chuck, would show this stranger who was master here!    With a squeal of rage, Johnny sprang at the gray old Chuck. Then began  such a fight as the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind  had never seen before. They danced around excitedly and cried: \"How  dreadful!\" and hoped that Johnny Chuck would win, for you know they  loved him very much.    Over and over the two little fighters rolled, biting and scratching and  tearing and growling and snarling. Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun hid  his face behind a cloud, so as not to see such a dreadful sight. The  stranger had been in many fights and he was very crafty. For a while  Johnny felt that he was getting the worst of it, and he began to wonder  if he really would have to leave the Green Meadows. The very thought  filled him with new rage and he fought harder than ever.    Now the stranger was old and his teeth were worn, while Johnny was young  and his teeth were very sharp. After a long, long time, Johnny felt the  stranger growing weaker. Johnny fought harder than ever. At last the  stranger cried \"Enough!\" and when he could break away, started back  towards the Old Pasture. Johnny Chuck had won!          VIII. JOHNNY HAS ANOTHER ADVENTURE      Johnny Chuck lay stretched out on the cool, soft grass of the Green  Meadows, panting for breath. He was very tired and very sore. His  face was scratched and bitten. His clothes were torn, and he smarted  dreadfully in a dozen places. But still Johnny Chuck was happy. When  he raised his head to look, he could see a gray old Chuck limping off  towards the Old Pasture. Once in a while the gray old Chuck would  turn his head and show his teeth, but he kept right on towards the Old  Pasture. Johnny Chuck smiled.    It had been a great fight, and more than once Johnny Chuck had thought  that he should have to give up. He thought of this now, and then he  thought with shame of how he had bragged and boasted just before the  fight. What if he had lost? He resolved that he would never again brag  or boast. But he also made up his mind that if any one should pick a  quarrel with him, he would show that he wasn't afraid.    It was getting late in the afternoon when Johnny finally felt rested  enough to go on. He had got to find a place to spend the night. He  hobbled along, for he was very stiff and sore, until he came to the edge  of the Green Meadows, where they meet the Green Forest.    Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun was almost ready to go down to his bed behind  the Purple Hills. Shadows were already beginning to creep through the  Green Forest. Somehow they gave Johnny Chuck that same lonesome feeling  that he had had when he first left his old home. You see he had always  lived out in the Green Meadows and somehow he was afraid of the Green  Forest in the night.    So, instead of going into the Green Forest, he wandered along the edge  of it, looking for a place in which to spend the night. At last he came  to a hollow log lying just out on the edge of the Green Meadows. Very  carefully Johnny Chuck examined it, to be sure that no one else was  using it.    \"It's just the place I'm looking for!\" he said aloud.    Just then there was a sharp hiss, a very fierce hiss. Johnny Chuck felt  the hair on his neck rise as it always did when he heard that hiss,  and he wasn't at all surprised, when he turned his head, to find Mr.  Blacksnake close by. Mr. Blacksnake glided swiftly up to the old log and  coiled himself in front of the opening. Then he raised his head and ran  out his tongue in the most impudent way.    \"Run along, Johnny Chuck! I've decided to sleep here myself to-night!\"  he said sharply.    Now when Johnny Chuck was a very little fellow, he had been in great  fear of Mr. Blacksnake, as he had had reason to be. And because he  didn't know any better, he had been afraid ever since. Mr. Blacksnake  knew this and so now he looked as ugly as he knew how. But you see he  didn't know about the great fight that Johnny Chuck had just won.    Now to win an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5891"],[0,"Travels in West Africa: Congo Français, Corisco and Cameroons (#3)"],[1,"on which I was to spend seven to The Graphic contributor's one; the  other from The Daily Telegraph, reviewing a French book of \"Phrases  in common use\" in Dahomey.  The opening sentence in the latter was,  \"Help, I am drowning.\"  Then came the inquiry, \"If a man is not a  thief?\" and then another cry, \"The boat is upset.\"  \"Get up, you  lazy scamps,\" is the next exclamation, followed almost immediately  by the question, \"Why has not this man been buried?\"  \"It is fetish  that has killed him, and he must lie here exposed with nothing on  him until only the bones remain,\" is the cheerful answer.  This  sounded discouraging to a person whose occupation would necessitate  going about considerably in boats, and whose fixed desire was to  study fetish.  So with a feeling of foreboding gloom I left London  for Liverpool--none the more cheerful for the matter-of-fact manner  in which the steamboat agents had informed me that they did not  issue return tickets by the West African lines of steamers.  I will  not go into the details of that voyage here, much as I am given to  discursiveness.  They are more amusing than instructive, for on my  first voyage out I did not know the Coast, and the Coast did not  know me and we mutually terrified each other.  I fully expected to  get killed by the local nobility and gentry; they thought I was  connected with the World's Women's Temperance Association, and  collecting shocking details for subsequent magic-lantern lectures on  the liquor traffic; so fearful misunderstandings arose, but we  gradually educated each other, and I had the best of the affair; for  all I had got to teach them was that I was only a beetle and fetish  hunter, and so forth, while they had to teach me a new world, and a  very fascinating course of study I found it.  And whatever the Coast  may have to say against me--for my continual desire for hair-pins,  and other pins, my intolerable habit of getting into water, the  abominations full of ants, that I brought into their houses, or  things emitting at unexpectedly short notice vivid and awful  stenches--they cannot but say that I was a diligent pupil, who  honestly tried to learn the lessons they taught me so kindly, though  some of those lessons were hard to a person who had never previously  been even in a tame bit of tropics, and whose life for many years  had been an entirely domestic one in a University town.    One by one I took my old ideas derived from books and thoughts based  on imperfect knowledge and weighed them against the real life around  me, and found them either worthless or wanting.  The greatest  recantation I had to make I made humbly before I had been three  months on the Coast in 1893.  It was of my idea of the traders.  What I had expected to find them was a very different thing to what  I did find them; and of their kindness to me I can never  sufficiently speak, for on that voyage I was utterly out of touch  with the governmental circles, and utterly dependent on the traders,  and the most useful lesson of all the lessons I learnt on the West  Coast in 1893 was that I could trust them.  Had I not learnt this  very thoroughly I could never have gone out again and carried out  the voyage I give you a sketch of in this book.    Thanks to \"the Agent,\" I have visited places I could never otherwise  have seen; and to the respect and affection in which he is held by  the native, I owe it that I have done so in safety.  When I have  arrived off his factory in a steamer or canoe unexpected,  unintroduced, or turned up equally unheralded out of the bush in a  dilapidated state, he has always received me with that gracious  hospitality which must have given him, under Coast conditions, very  real trouble and inconvenience--things he could have so readily  found logical excuses against entailing upon himself for the sake of  an individual whom he had never seen before--whom he most likely  would never see again--and whom it was no earthly profit to him to  see then.  He has bestowed himself--Allah only knows where--on his  small trading vessels so that I might have his one cabin.  He has  fished me out of sea and fresh water with boat-hooks; he has  continually given me good advice, which if I had only followed would  have enabled me to keep out of water and any other sort of  affliction; and although he holds the meanest opinion of my  intellect for going to such a place as West Africa for beetles,  fishes and fetish, he has given me the greatest assistance in my  work.  The value of that work I pray you withhold judgment on, until  I lay it before you in some ten volumes or so mostly in Latin.  All  I know that is true regarding West African facts, I owe to the  traders; the errors are my own.    To Dr. Gunther, of the British Museum, I am deeply grateful for the  kindness and interest he has always shown regarding all the  specimens of natural history that I have been able to lay before  him; the majority of which must have had very old tales to tell him.  Yet his courtesy and attention gave me the thing a worker in any  work most wants--the sense that the work was worth doing--and sent  me back to work again with the knowledge that if these things  interested a man like him, it was a more than sufficient reason for  me to go on collecting them.  To Mr. W. H. F. Kirby I am much  indebted for his working out my small collection of certain Orders  of insects; and to Mr. Thomas S. Forshaw, for the great help he has  afforded me in revising my notes.    It is impossible for me even to catalogue my debts of gratitude  still outstanding to the West Coast.  Chiefly am I indebted to Mr.  C. G. Hudson, whose kindness and influence enabled me to go up the  Ogowe and to see as much of Congo Francais as I have seen, and his  efforts to take care of me were most ably seconded by Mr. Fildes.  The French officials in \"Congo Francais\" never hindered me, and  always treated me with the greatest kindness.  You may say there was  no reason why they should not, for there is nothing in this fine  colony of France that they need be ashamed of any one seeing; but I  find it is customary for travellers to say the French officials  throw obstacles in the way of any one visiting their possessions, so  I merely beg to state this was decidedly not my experience; although  my deplorable ignorance of French prevented me from explaining my  humble intentions to them.    The Rev. Dr. Nassau and Mr. R. E. Dennett have enabled me, by  placing at my disposal the rich funds of their knowledge of native  life and idea, to amplify any deductions from my own observation.  Mr. Dennett's work I have not dealt with in this work because it  refers to tribes I was not amongst on this journey, but to a tribe I  made the acquaintance with in my '93 voyage--the Fjort.  Dr.  Nassau's observations I have referred to.  Herr von Lucke, Vice-  governor of Cameroon, I am indebted to for not only allowing me, but  for assisting me by every means in his power, to go up Cameroons  Peak, and to the Governor of Cameroon, Herr von Puttkamer, for his  constant help and kindness.  Indeed so great has been the  willingness to help me of all these gentlemen, that it is a wonder  to me, when I think of it, that their efforts did not project me  right across the continent and out at Zanzibar.  That this brilliant  affair did not come off is owing to my own lack of enterprise; for I  did not want to go across the continent, and I do not hanker after  Zanzibar, but only to go puddling about obscure districts in West  Africa after raw fetish and fresh-water fishes.    I owe my ability to have profited by the kindness of these gentlemen  on land, to a gentleman of the sea--Captain Murray.  He was captain  of the vessel I went out on in 1893, and he saw then that my mind  was full of errors that must be eradicated if I was going to deal  with the Coast successfully; and so he eradicated those errors and  replaced them with sound knowledge from his own stores collected  during an acquaintance with the West Coast of over thirty years.  The education he has given me has been of the greatest value to me,  and I sincerely hope to make many more voyages under him, for I well  know he has still much to teach and I to learn.    Last, but not least, I must chronicle my debts to the ladies.  First  to those two courteous Portuguese ladies, Donna Anna de Sousa  Coutinho e Chichorro and her sister Donna Maria de Sousa Coutinho,  who did so much for me in Kacongo in 1893, and have remained, I am  proud to say, my firm friends ever since.  Lady MacDonald and Miss  Mary Slessor I speak of in this book, but only faintly sketch the  pleasure and help they have afforded me; nor have I fully expressed  my gratitude for the kindness of Madame Jacot of Lembarene, or  Madame Forget of Talagouga.  Then there are a whole list of nuns  belonging to the Roman Catholic Missions on the South West Coast,  ever cheery and charming companions; and Frau Plehn, whom it was a  continual pleasure to see in Cameroons, and discourse with once  again on things that seemed so far off then--art, science, and  literature; and Mrs. H. Duggan, of Cameroons too, who used, whenever  I came into that port to rescue me from fearful states of starvation  for toilet necessaries, and lend a sympathetic and intelligent ear  to the \"awful sufferings\" I had gone through, until Cameroons became  to me a thing to look forward to.    When in the Canaries in 1892, I used to smile, I regretfully own, at  the conversation of a gentleman from the Gold Coast who was up there  recruiting after a bad fever.  His conversation consisted largely of  anecdotes of friends of his, and nine times in ten he used to say,  \"He's dead now.\"  Alas! my own conversation may be smiled at now for  the same cause.  Many of my friends mentioned even in this very  recent account of the Coast \"are dead now.\"  Most of those I learnt  to know in 1893; chief among these is my old"]]]
