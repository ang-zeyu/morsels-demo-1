Ah!\"    The measured step had passed without a pause. Raffles drew a deep  breath, and his singular grip of me slowly relaxed.    \"But still, not a sound,\" he continued in the same whisper; \"we'll take  a rise out of him, wherever he is!  Slip off your shoes and follow me.\"    Well, you may wonder at my doing so; but you can never have met A. J.  Raffles.  Half his power lay in a conciliating trick of sinking the  commander in the leader.  And it was impossible not to follow one who  led with such a zest.  You might question, but you followed first.  So  now, when I heard him kick off his own shoes, I did the same, and was  on the stairs at his heels before I realized what an extraordinary way  was this of approaching a stranger for money in the dead of night.  But  obviously Raffles and he were on exceptional terms of intimacy, and I  could not but infer that they were in the habit of playing practical  jokes upon each other.    We groped our way so slowly upstairs that I had time to make more than  one note before we reached the top.  The stair was uncarpeted.  The  spread fingers of my right hand encountered nothing on the damp wall;  those of my left trailed through a dust that could be felt on the  banisters. An eerie sensation had been upon me since we entered the  house.  It increased with every step we climbed.  What hermit were we  going to startle in his cell?    We came to a landing.  The banisters led us to the left, and to the  left again.  Four steps more, and we were on another and a longer  landing, and suddenly a match blazed from the black.  I never heard it  struck.  Its flash was blinding.  When my eyes became accustomed to the  light, there was Raffles holding up the match with one hand, and  shading it with the other, between bare boards, stripped walls, and the  open doors of empty rooms.    \"Where have you brought me?\" I cried.  \"The house is unoccupied!\"    \"Hush!  Wait!\" he whispered, and he led the way into one of the empty  rooms.  His match went out as we crossed the threshold, and he struck  another without the slightest noise.  Then he stood with his back to  me, fumbling with something that I could not see.  But, when he threw  the second match away, there was some other light in its stead, and a  slight smell of oil.  I stepped forward to look over his shoulder, but  before I could do so he had turned and flashed a tiny lantern in my  face.    \"What's this?\" I gasped.  \"What rotten trick are you going to play?\"    \"It's played,\" he answered, with his quiet laugh.    \"On me?\"    \"I am afraid so, Bunny.\"    \"Is there no one in the house, then?\"    \"No one but ourselves.\"    \"So it was mere chaff about your friend in Bond Street, who could let  us have that money?\"    \"Not altogether.  It's quite true that Danby is a friend of mine.\"    \"Danby?\"    \"The jeweller underneath.\"    \"What do you mean?\" I whispered, trembling like a leaf as his meaning  dawned upon me.  \"Are we to get the money from the jeweller?\"    \"Well, not exactly.\"    \"What, then?\"    \"The equivalent--from his shop.\"    There was no need for another question.  I understood everything but my  own density.  He had given me a dozen hints, and I had taken none. And  there I stood staring at him, in that empty room; and there he stood  with his dark lantern, laughing at me.    \"A burglar!\" I gasped.  \"You--you!\"    \"I told you I lived by my wits.\"    \"Why couldn't you tell me what you were going to do?  Why couldn't you  trust me?  Why must you lie?\" I demanded, piqued to the quick for all  my horror.    \"I wanted to tell you,\" said he.  \"I was on the point of telling you  more than once.  You may remember how I sounded you about crime, though  you have probably forgotten what you said yourself.  I didn't think you  meant it at the time, but I thought I'd put you to the test.  Now I see  you didn't, and I don't blame you.  I only am to blame. Get out of it,  my dear boy, as quick as you can; leave it to me.  You won't give me  away, whatever else you do!\"    Oh, his cleverness!  His fiendish cleverness! Had he fallen back on  threats, coercion, sneers, all might have been different even yet.  But  he set me free to leave him in the lurch.  He would not blame me.  He  did not even bind me to secrecy; he trusted me.  He knew my weakness  and my strength, and was playing on both with his master's touch.    \"Not so fast,\" said I.  \"Did I put this into your head, or were you  going to do it in any case?\"    \"Not in any case,\" said Raffles.  \"It's true I've had the key for days,  but when I won to-night I thought of chucking it; for, as a matter of  fact, it's not a one-man job.\"    \"That settles it.  I'm your man.\"    \"You mean it?\"    \"Yes--for to-night.\"    \"Good old Bunny,\" he murmured, holding the lantern for one moment to my  face; the next he was explaining his plans, and I was nodding, as  though we had been fellow-cracksmen all our days.    \"I know the shop,\" he whispered, \"because I've got a few things there.  I know this upper part too; it's been to let for a month, and I got an  order to view, and took a cast of the key before using it. The one  thing I don't know is how to make a connection between the two; at  present there's none. We may make it up here, though I rather fancy the  basement myself.  If you wait a minute I'll tell you.\"    He set his lantern on the floor, crept to a back window, and opened it  with scarcely a sound: only to return, shaking his head, after shutting  the window with the same care.    \"That was our one chance,\" said he; \"a back window above a back window;  but it's too dark to see anything, and we daren't show an outside  light. Come down after me to the basement; and remember, though there's  not a soul on the premises, you can't make too little noise.  There--there--listen to that!\"    It was the measured tread that we had heard before on the flagstones  outside.  Raffles darkened his lantern, and again we stood motionless  till it had passed.    \"Either a policeman,\" he muttered, \"or a watchman that all these  jewellers run between them. The watchman's the man for us to watch;  he's simply paid to spot this kind of thing.\"    We crept very gingerly down the stairs, which creaked a bit in spite of  us, and we picked up our shoes in the passage; then down some narrow  stone steps, at the foot of which Raffles showed his light, and put on  his shoes once more, bidding me do the same in a rather louder tone  than he had permitted himself to employ overhead.  We were now  considerably below the level of the street, in a small space with as  many doors as it had sides.  Three were ajar, and we saw through them  into empty cellars; but in the fourth a key was turned and a bolt  drawn; and this one presently let us out into the bottom of a deep,  square well of fog.  A similar door faced it across this area, and  Raffles had the lantern close against it, and was hiding the light with  his body, when a short and sudden crash made my heart stand still.  Next moment I saw the door wide open, and Raffles standing within and  beckoning me with a jimmy.    \"Door number one,\" he whispered.  \"Deuce knows how many more there'll  be, but I know of two at least.  We won't have to make much noise over  them, either; down here there's less risk.\"    We were now at the bottom of the exact fellow to the narrow stone stair  which we had just descended: the yard, or well, being the one part  common to both the private and the business premises.  But this flight  led to no open passage; instead, a singularly solid mahogany door  confronted us at the top.    \"I thought so,\" muttered Raffles, handing me the lantern, and pocketing  a bunch of skeleton keys, after tampering for a few minutes with the  lock. \"It'll be an hour's work to get through that!\"    \"Can't you pick it?\"    \"No: I know these locks.  It's no use trying. We must cut it out, and  it'll take us an hour.\"    It took us forty-seven minutes by my watch; or, rather, it took  Raffles; and never in my life have I seen anything more deliberately  done.  My part was simply to stand by with the dark lantern in one  hand, and a small bottle of rock-oil in the other.    Raffles had produced a pretty embroidered case, intended obviously for  his razors, but filled instead with the tools of his secret trade,  including the rock-oil.  From this case he selected a \"bit,\" capable of  drilling a hole an inch in diameter, and fitted it to a small but very  strong steel \"brace.\" Then he took off his covert-coat and his blazer,  spread them neatly on the top step--knelt on them--turned up his shirt  cuffs--and went to work with brace-and-bit near the key-hole.  But  first he oiled the bit to minimize the noise, and this he did  invariably before beginning a fresh hole, and often in the middle of  one.  It took thirty-two separate borings to cut around that lock.    I noticed that through the first circular orifice Raffles thrust a  forefinger; then, as the circle became an ever-lengthening oval, he got  his hand through up to the thumb; and I heard him swear softly to  himself.    \"I was afraid so!\"    \"What is it?\"    \"An iron gate on the other side!\"    \"How on earth are we to get through that?\" I asked in dismay.    \"Pick the lock.  But there may be two.  In that case they'll be top and  bottom, and we shall have two fresh holes to make, as the door opens  inwards. It won't open two inches as it is.\"    I confess I did not feel sanguine about the lock-picking, seeing that  one lock had baffled us already; and my disappointment and impatience  must have been a revelation to me had I stopped to think. The truth is  that I was entering into our nefarious undertaking with an involuntary  zeal of which I was myself quite unconscious at the time.  The romance  and the peril of the whole proceeding held me spellbound and entranced.  My moral sense and my sense of fear were stricken by a common  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7060"],[0,"At Agincourt (#3)"],[1,"three  thousand men.    \"The Parisians received her with applause, and as soon as she had taken up  her quarters at the Louvre, the Dukes of Berri, Bourbon, and Brittany, the  Constable, and all the great officers of the court rallied round her. Two  days later the Duchess of Orleans arrived with a long train of mourning  coaches. A great assembly was held, and the king's advocate announced to  them the intention of the king to confer the government upon the queen  during his illness, and produced a document signed by the king to that  effect. The Duchess of Orleans then came forward, and kneeling before the  dauphin, begged for justice for the death of her husband, and that she  might be granted an opportunity of refuting the calumnies that John Petit  had heaped on the memory of her husband. A week later another great  assembly was held, and the justification of the duke was read, refuting  all these imputations, and the duchess's advocate demanded that the duke  should be forced to make public reparation, and then to be exiled for  twenty years. The dauphin replied that he and all the princes of blood  royal present held that the charges against the Duke of Orleans had been  amply refuted, and that the demands with reference to the Duke of Burgundy  should be provided for in course of justice.    \"Scarcely had the assembly broken up when it became known that Burgundy  and his army was on the way back to Paris. Resistance was out of the  question; therefore, taking the young dauphin with her, and accompanied by  all the members of the royal family, the queen retired to Tours. Burgundy,  unscrupulous as he was, finding that although he might remain master of  Paris, he could not hope to rule France, except when acting under the  pretence of the king's authority, soon sent an embassy to Tours to  endeavour to arrange matters. He was able to effect this with the less  difficulty, that the Duchess of Orleans had just died from grief at her  husband's death, and at the hopelessness of obtaining vengeance on his  murderer. The queen was won to the cause of Burgundy by secret proposals  submitted to her for a close league between them, and in March a treaty  was concluded, and a meeting took place at Chartres, at which the duke,  the king, the queen, the royal princes, and the young Duke of Orleans and  his adherents were present.    \"The king declared that he pardoned the duke, and the princes of Orleans  consented to obey his orders and to lay aside all hatred and thoughts of  vengeance, and shortly afterwards Paris welcomed with shouts of joy the  return of the king and queen and the apparent reconciliation of all  parties. But the truce was a brief one; for the princes and adherents of  Orleans might bend before circumstances at the moment, but their feelings  were unchanged.    \"A head of the party was needed, and the young duke married the daughter  of Count Bernard d'Armagnac, one of the most powerful and ambitious nobles  of the south of France, who at once,--in concert with the Dukes of Berri  and Brittany and other lords,--put himself at the head of the Orleans  party. On the 10th of July, 1411, the three princes of Orleans sent a long  letter to the king, complaining that no reparation whatever had been made  for the murder of their father, and begging him that, as what was done at  Chartres was contrary to every principle of law, equity, reason, and  justice, the case should be reopened again. They also made complaints  against the Duke of Burgundy for his conduct and abuse of power.    \"As the king was surrounded by Burgundy's creatures no favourable reply  was returned, and a formal challenge or declaration of war was, on the  18th of July, sent by the princes to the Duke of Burgundy, and both  parties began at once to make preparation for war.    \"Now for my own view of this quarrel. King Henry sent for me a year since,  and asked for whom I should hold my castle if Orleans and Burgundy came to  blows, adding that Burgundy would be viewed by him with most favour.    \"'My father and grandfather ever fought faithfully in the service of  England,' I said; 'but for years past now, the line betwixt your majesty's  possessions and those of France has been drawn in, and my estates and  Castle of Villeroy now lie beyond the line, and I am therefore a vassal of  France as well as of your majesty. It being known to all men that even  before I became Lord of Summerley, on my marriage with your majesty's  ward, Mistress Margaret, I, like my father, held myself to be the liege  man of the King of England. I am therefore viewed with much hostility by  my neighbours, and right gladly would they seize upon any excuse to lay  complaint against me before the king, in order that I might be deprived of  my fief and castle.    \"'This I would fain hold always for your majesty; and, seeing how it is  situated but a few miles across the frontier, it is, I would humbly submit  to you, of importance to your majesty that it should be held by one  faithful to you--since its possession in the hands of an enemy would  greatly hinder any English army marching out from Calais to the invasion  of France. It is a place of some strength now; but were it in French hands  it might be made very much stronger, and would cost much time and loss of  men to besiege. At present your majesty is in alliance with Burgundy, but  none can say how the war will go, or what changes will take place; and  should the Orleanists gain the upper hand, they will be quick to take  advantage of my having fought for Burgundy, and would confiscate my  estates and hand them over to one who might be hostile to England, and  pledged to make the castle a stronghold that would greatly hinder and bar  the advance of an English army upon Paris. Therefore, Sire, I would, not  for my own sake but for the sake of your majesty's self and your  successors, pray you to let me for a while remain quietly at Summerley  until the course of events in France is determined.'    \"The king was pleased to see the force of what I urged. As far as I had  inclinations in the case, they were towards the cause, not of Burgundy  himself, whose murder of Orleans was alike treacherous and indefensible,  but of his cause, seeing that Flanders is wholly under his authority, and  that in Artois he is well-nigh paramount at present. On the other hand,  Amiens and Ponthieu, which lie but a short distance to the south of me,  are strongly Orleanist, and I have therefore every motive for standing  aloof. So far the fortune of war has been so changeable that one cannot  say that the chances incline towards one faction more than the other. Even  the Church has failed to bring about the end of the troubles. The  Orleanists have been formally placed under interdicts, and cursed by book,  bell, and candle. The king's commands have been laid upon all to put aside  their quarrels, but both the ban of the Church and the king's commands  have been ineffectual. I am as anxious as ever to abstain from taking any  part in the trouble, the more so as the alliance between our king and  Burgundy has cooled somewhat. But I have received such urgent prayers from  my vassals at Villeroy to come among them, since they are now being  plundered by both parties, that I feel it is time for me to take up my  abode there. When the king stayed at Winchester, a month since, I laid the  matter before him. He was pleased to say that what I had urged a year ago  had turned out to be as I foretold, and that he would give me leave to go  over and establish myself at Villeroy, and to hold myself aloof from both  parties until the matter should further ripen. What will come of it I  cannot say. The English king seemed to me to be ailing, and I fear that it  may not be long before young Henry comes to the throne. He is a wild young  prince, but has already shown himself in the Northern war to be full of  spirit and courage, and methinks that when he comes to the throne he will  not long observe the peaceful policy of his father, but that we shall see  the royal standard once again spread to the winds of France.\"    \"But, Sir Eustace,\" Guy said, when he had concluded, \"how do these matters  affect you? I thought that by the treaty the west part of Artois was  English.\"    \"Ay, lad, it was so settled; but at that time the strength of France had  been broken at Poitiers, and the Black Prince and his army were so feared  that his terms were willingly accepted in order to secure peace. Much has  happened since then: war has been constantly going on, sometimes hotly,  sometimes sluggishly; France has had her own troubles, and as the English  kings have been more pacific, and England has become weary of bearing the  heavy expenses of the war, the treaty has become a dead letter. Gascony,  in which province Armagnac is the greatest lord, is altogether lost to  England, as is the greater part of Guienne. A great proportion of the  people there were always bitterly opposed to the change, and, as you know,  even in the time of the Black Prince himself there were great rebellions  and troubles; since then town after town and castle after castle has  declared for France, and no real efforts have ever been made by the  English to win them back again. I, who in England am an English baron,  and--so long as things go on as at present--a French noble while in  France, am in a perilous position between my two Suzerains. Were an  English army to land, I should join them, for I still hold myself to be a  vassal of the king of England, as we have been for three generations. As  to the French disputes, I fear that sooner or later I shall have to  declare in favour of one party or the other, for it will be difficult to  stand altogether aloof from these conflicts, because all men, at least all  men of condition, are well-nigh forced to take one side or the other. The  plea that I am a baron of England will be of no avail, for both sides  would turn"]]]
