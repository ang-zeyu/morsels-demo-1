It did not take the castaways long to reach the shore, you may be sure.  The yellow hen flew to the sands at once, but Dorothy had to climb over  the high slats.  Still, for a country girl, that was not much of a  feat, and as soon as she was safe ashore Dorothy drew off her wet shoes  and stockings and spread them upon the sun-warmed beach to dry.    Then she sat down and watched Billina, who was pick-pecking away with  her sharp bill in the sand and gravel, which she scratched up and  turned over with her strong claws.    \"What are you doing?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Getting my breakfast, of course,\" murmured the hen, busily pecking  away.    \"What do you find?\" inquired the girl, curiously.    \"Oh, some fat red ants, and some sand-bugs, and once in a while a tiny  crab.  They are very sweet and nice, I assure you.\"    \"How dreadful!\" exclaimed Dorothy, in a shocked voice.    \"What is dreadful?\" asked the hen, lifting her head to gaze with one  bright eye at her companion.    \"Why, eating live things, and horrid bugs, and crawly ants.  You ought  to be 'SHAMED of yourself!\"    \"Goodness me!\" returned the hen, in a puzzled tone; \"how queer you are,  Dorothy!  Live things are much fresher and more wholesome than dead  ones, and you humans eat all sorts of dead creatures.\"    \"We don't!\" said Dorothy.    \"You do, indeed,\" answered Billina.  \"You eat lambs and sheep and cows  and pigs and even chickens.\"    \"But we cook 'em,\" said Dorothy, triumphantly.    \"What difference does that make?\"    \"A good deal,\" said the girl, in a graver tone.  \"I can't just 'splain  the diff'rence, but it's there.  And, anyhow, we never eat such  dreadful things as BUGS.\"    \"But you eat the chickens that eat the bugs,\" retorted the yellow hen,  with an odd cackle.  \"So you are just as bad as we chickens are.\"    This made Dorothy thoughtful.  What Billina said was true enough, and  it almost took away her appetite for breakfast.  As for the yellow hen,  she continued to peck away at the sand busily, and seemed quite  contented with her bill-of-fare.    Finally, down near the water's edge, Billina stuck her bill deep into  the sand, and then drew back and shivered.    \"Ow!\" she cried.  \"I struck metal, that time, and it nearly broke my  beak.\"    \"It prob'bly was a rock,\" said Dorothy, carelessly.    \"Nonsense.  I know a rock from metal, I guess,\" said the hen.  \"There's  a different feel to it.\"    \"But there couldn't be any metal on this wild, deserted seashore,\"  persisted the girl.  \"Where's the place?  I'll dig it up, and prove to  you I'm right.\"    Billina showed her the place where she had \"stubbed her bill,\" as she  expressed it, and Dorothy dug away the sand until she felt something  hard.  Then, thrusting in her hand, she pulled the thing out, and  discovered it to be a large sized golden key--rather old, but still  bright and of perfect shape.    \"What did I tell you?\" cried the hen, with a cackle of triumph.  \"Can I  tell metal when I bump into it, or is the thing a rock?\"    \"It's metal, sure enough,\" answered the child, gazing thoughtfully at  the curious thing she had found.  \"I think it is pure gold, and it must  have lain hidden in the sand for a long time.  How do you suppose it  came there, Billina?  And what do you suppose this mysterious key  unlocks?\"    \"I can't say,\" replied the hen.  \"You ought to know more about locks  and keys than I do.\"    Dorothy glanced around.  There was no sign of any house in that part of  the country, and she reasoned that every key must fit a lock and every  lock must have a purpose.  Perhaps the key had been lost by somebody  who lived far away, but had wandered on this very shore.    Musing on these things the girl put the key in the pocket of her dress  and then slowly drew on her shoes and stockings, which the sun had  fully dried.    \"I b'lieve, Billina,\" she said, \"I'll have a look 'round, and see if I  can find some breakfast.\"          3.  Letters in the Sand      Walking a little way back from the water's edge, toward the grove of  trees, Dorothy came to a flat stretch of white sand that seemed to have  queer signs marked upon its surface, just as one would write upon sand  with a stick.    \"What does it say?\" she asked the yellow hen, who trotted along beside  her in a rather dignified fashion.    \"How should I know?\" returned the hen.  \"I cannot read.\"    \"Oh!  Can't you?\"    \"Certainly not; I've never been to school, you know.\"    \"Well, I have,\" admitted Dorothy; \"but the letters are big and far  apart, and it's hard to spell out the words.\"    But she looked at each letter carefully, and finally discovered that  these words were written in the sand:    \"BEWARE THE WHEELERS!\"      \"That's rather strange,\" declared the hen, when Dorothy had read aloud  the words.  \"What do you suppose the Wheelers are?\"    \"Folks that wheel, I guess.  They must have wheelbarrows, or baby-cabs  or hand-carts,\" said Dorothy.    \"Perhaps they're automobiles,\" suggested the yellow hen.  \"There is no  need to beware of baby-cabs and wheelbarrows; but automobiles are  dangerous things.  Several of my friends have been run over by them.\"    \"It can't be auto'biles,\" replied the girl, \"for this is a new, wild  country, without even trolley-cars or tel'phones.  The people here  haven't been discovered yet, I'm sure; that is, if there ARE any  people.  So I don't b'lieve there CAN be any auto'biles, Billina.\"    \"Perhaps not,\" admitted the yellow hen.  \"Where are you going now?\"    \"Over to those trees, to see if I can find some fruit or nuts,\"  answered Dorothy.    She tramped across the sand, skirting the foot of one of the little  rocky hills that stood near, and soon reached the edge of the forest.    At first she was greatly disappointed, because the nearer trees were  all punita, or cotton-wood or eucalyptus, and bore no fruit or nuts at  all.  But, bye and bye, when she was almost in despair, the little girl  came upon two trees that promised to furnish her with plenty of food.    One was quite full of square paper boxes, which grew in clusters on all  the limbs, and upon the biggest and ripest boxes the word \"Lunch\" could  be read, in neat raised letters.  This tree seemed to bear all the year  around, for there were lunch-box blossoms on some of the branches, and  on others tiny little lunch-boxes that were as yet quite green, and  evidently not fit to eat until they had grown bigger.    The leaves of this tree were all paper napkins, and it presented a very  pleasing appearance to the hungry little girl.    But the tree next to the lunch-box tree was even more wonderful, for it  bore quantities of tin dinner-pails, which were so full and heavy that  the stout branches bent underneath their weight.  Some were small and  dark-brown in color; those larger were of a dull tin color; but the  really ripe ones were pails of bright tin that shone and glistened  beautifully in the rays of sunshine that touched them.    Dorothy was delighted, and even the yellow hen acknowledged that she  was surprised.    The little girl stood on tip-toe and picked one of the nicest and  biggest lunch-boxes, and then she sat down upon the ground and eagerly  opened it.  Inside she found, nicely wrapped in white papers, a ham  sandwich, a piece of sponge-cake, a pickle, a slice of new cheese and  an apple.  Each thing had a separate stem, and so had to be picked off  the side of the box; but Dorothy found them all to be delicious, and  she ate every bit of luncheon in the box before she had finished.    \"A lunch isn't zactly breakfast,\" she said to Billina, who sat beside  her curiously watching.  \"But when one is hungry one can eat even  supper in the morning, and not complain.\"    \"I hope your lunch-box was perfectly ripe,\" observed the yellow hen, in  a anxious tone.  \"So much sickness is caused by eating green things.\"    \"Oh, I'm sure it was ripe,\" declared Dorothy, \"all, that is, 'cept the  pickle, and a pickle just HAS to be green, Billina.  But everything  tasted perfectly splendid, and I'd rather have it than a church picnic.  And now I think I'll pick a dinner-pail, to have when I get hungry  again, and then we'll start out and 'splore the country, and see where  we are.\"    \"Haven't you any idea what country this is?\" inquired Billina.    \"None at all.  But listen: I'm quite sure it's a fairy country, or such  things as lunch-boxes and dinner-pails wouldn't be growing upon trees.  Besides, Billina, being a hen, you wouldn't be able to talk in any  civ'lized country, like Kansas, where no fairies live at all.\"    \"Perhaps we're in the Land of Oz,\" said the hen, thoughtfully.    \"No, that can't be,\" answered the little girl; \"because I've been to  the Land of Oz, and it's all surrounded by a horrid desert that no one  can cross.\"    \"Then how did you get away from there again?\" asked Billina.    \"I had a pair of silver shoes, that carried me through the air; but I  lost them,\" said Dorothy.    \"Ah, indeed,\" remarked the yellow hen, in a tone of unbelief.    \"Anyhow,\" resumed the girl, \"there is no seashore near the Land of Oz,  so this must surely be some other fairy country.\"    While she was speaking she selected a bright and pretty dinner-pail  that seemed to have a stout handle, and picked it from its branch.  Then, accompanied by the yellow hen, she walked out of the shadow of  the trees toward the sea-shore.    They were part way across the sands when Billina suddenly cried, in a  voice of terror:    \"What's that?\"    Dorothy turned quickly around, and saw coming out of a path that led  from between the trees the most peculiar person her eyes had ever  beheld.    It had the form of a man, except that it walked, or rather rolled, upon  all fours, and its legs were the same length as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48991"],[0,"Leyte: The Return to the Philippines (#3)"],[1,"                                     5  Guerrillas Prepare for Inspection at Consuegra                      15  Gen.

LEYTE: THE RETURN TO THE PHILIPPINES      CHAPTER I    The Strategic Plan      \"It is with the deepest regret that I must inform you that conditions  over which I have no control have necessitated the surrender of  troops under my command.\" [2] With this message of 20 May 1942,  from Lt. Col. Theodore M. Cornell, U.S. Army, to Bernardo Torres,  Governor of Leyte, the control which the United States had held over  the island since 1898 came to an end. Nearly two and a half years were  to elapse before the sound of naval guns in Leyte Gulf would announce  to the world the opening of the Leyte Campaign, the first phase of  the re-entry of American forces into the Philippine Archipelago. (Map  1--inside back cover)    The primary purpose of the Leyte Campaign was to establish an air  and logistical base in the Leyte area in order to support operations  in the Luzon-Formosa-China coast area and particularly to nullify  Japanese strength in Luzon. Leyte is one of the Visayan Islands,  which constitute the geographical heart of the Philippines. It was  hoped that the fertile Leyte Valley, broad and flat, could be utilized  for major airfields and base sites from which large-scale operations  could be launched against the rest of the Philippines.          Preliminary Discussion    Behind the decision to go into Leyte lay a series of strategically  significant victories, which had followed a staggering initial  reverse. American prewar plans for the Pacific had originally been  based on the assumption that only the United States and Japan would  be at war and that the U.S. Pacific Fleet would be in existence. [3]  But the destruction of the fleet at Pearl Harbor and the entrance of  Germany and Italy into the war nullified these plans. The strategy of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff [4] in early 1942, therefore, was concerned  chiefly with trying to limit the rapid advance of the Japanese and  with keeping the line of communications to Australia open. The Pacific  Theater was divided into command areas--the Southwest Pacific Area,  with General Douglas MacArthur as Supreme Commander (he referred to  himself, however, as Commander in Chief), and the Pacific Ocean Area  (which included the Central Pacific), with Admiral Chester W. Nimitz  as Commander in Chief. [5]    In 1942 and 1943 the Allied forces had halted the Japanese at Papua  and Guadalcanal and started to push them back. On 8 May 1943 the Joint  Chiefs approved a \"Strategic Plan for the Defeat of Japan,\" which  was endorsed by the Combined Chiefs in December. The objective of the  plan was to secure the unconditional surrender of Japan, an objective  that might necessitate an invasion of the Japanese home islands. As  such an invasion promised to be a \"vast undertaking,\" it would be  necessary to secure a large supply base from which a great aerial  offensive could be mounted against Japan. According to the original  plan this base was to be located in China, but the Mariana Islands were  afterward substituted for China. The plan called for the acquisition  of successive island bases which could be used as \"steppingstones,\"  preferably those which would shorten the sea route, provide for its  security, and at the same time deny to the Japanese bases from which  they might interfere with the Allied line of communications. The main  effort was to be through the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Nimitz'  operations were to be conducted west through the Japanese mandated  islands while MacArthur's proceeded northwest along the New Guinea  coast. The two series of operations were to be mutually supporting. [6]    Although no specific islands were named in the Strategic Plan,  the Philippine Archipelago, because of its strategic position and  long possession by the United States, naturally loomed large in the  planning. The Philippines lie athwart all sea routes south from Japan  to the economically important Netherlands Indies--rich in rubber, tin,  oil, and rice. The capture of the Philippines would help to sever this  line of communications and would furnish an excellent staging area  for attacks against China, Formosa, or Japan. Aside from strategic  considerations, the liberation of the Islands was important for  reasons of Far Eastern politics and prestige. [7] The obligation of the  United States to the subjugated Filipino people could not be lightly  ignored. Furthermore, General MacArthur was imbued with a burning  determination to return to the Philippine Islands and avenge the  humiliating defeats suffered by the American forces in 1941 and 1942.    By the spring of 1944 the operations in the Pacific were going  so well that the successes had exceeded even the most optimistic  hopes of any of the planning officers. On 12 March the Joint Chiefs  ordered General MacArthur to"]]]
