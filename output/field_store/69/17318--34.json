The latter, which had been running a monthly round trip  stage between these terminals, was known as the West End Division of the  Central Route, and was called the Chorpenning line.    Besides conducting the Pony Express, the corporation aimed to continue a  large passenger and freighting business, so it next absorbed the  Leavenworth and Pike's Peak Express Co., which had been organized a year  previously and had maintained a daily stage between Leavenworth and  Denver, on the Smoky Hill River Route.    By mutual agreement, Mr. Russell assumed managerial charge of the  Eastern Division of the Pony Express line which lay between St. Joseph  and Salt Lake City. Ficklin was stationed at Salt Lake City, the middle  point, in a similar capacity. Finney was made Western manager with  headquarters at San Francisco. These men now had to revise the route to  be traversed, equip it with relay or relief stations which must be  provisioned for men and horses, hire dependable men as station-keepers  and riders, and buy high grade horses[1] or ponies for the entire  course, nearly two thousand miles in extent. Between St. Joseph and Salt  Lake City, the company had its old stage route which was already well  supplied with stations. West of Salt Lake the old Chorpenning route had  been poorly equipped, which made it necessary to erect new stations over  much of this course of more than seven hundred miles. The entire line of  travel had to be altered in many places, in some instances to shorten  the distance, and in others, to avoid as much as possible, wild places  where Indians might easily ambush the riders.    The management was fortunate in having the assistance of expert  subordinates. A. B. Miller of Leavenworth, a noteworthy employe of the  original firm, was invaluable in helping to formulate the general plans  of organization. At Salt Lake City, Ficklin secured the services of J.  C. Brumley, resident agent of the company, whose vast knowledge of the  route and the country that it covered enabled him quickly to work out a  schedule, and to ascertain with remarkable accuracy the number of relay  and supply stations, their best location, and also the number of horses  and men needed. At Carson City, Nevada, Bolivar Roberts, local  superintendent of the Western Division, hired upwards of sixty riders,  cool-headed nervy men, hardened by years of life in the open. Horses  were purchased throughout the West. They were the best that money could  buy and ranged from tough California cayuses or mustangs to thoroughbred  stock from Iowa. They were bought at an average figure of $200.00 each,  a high price in those days. The men were the pick of the frontier; no  more expressive description of their qualities can be given. They were  hired at salaries varying from $50.00 to $150.00 per month, the riders  receiving the highest pay of any below executive rank. When fully  equipped, the line comprised 190 stations, about 420 horses, 400 station  men and assistants and eighty riders. These are approximate figures, as  they varied slightly from time to time.    Perfecting these plans and assembling this array of splendid equipment  had been no easy task, yet so well had the organizers understood their  business, and so persistently, yet quietly, had they worked, that they  accomplished their purpose and made ready within two months after the  project had been launched. The public was scarcely aware of what was  going on until conspicuous advertisements announced the Pony Express. It  was planned to open the line early in April.        [1] While always called the Pony Express, there were many blooded horses  as well as ponies in the service. The distinction between these types of  animals is of course well known to the average reader. Probably \"Pony\"  Express \"sounded better\" than any other name for the service, hence the  adoption of this name by the firm and the public at large. This book  will use the words horse and pony indiscriminately.          Chapter III    The First Trip and Triumph      On March 26, 1860, there appeared simultaneously in the St. Louis  Republic and the New York Herald the following notice:    To San Francisco in 8 days by the Central Overland California and Pike's  Peak Express Company. The first courier of the Pony Express will leave  the Missouri River on Tuesday April 3rd at 5 o'clock P. M. and will run  regularly weekly hereafter, carrying a letter mail only. The point of  departure on the Missouri River will be in telegraphic connection with  the East and will be announced in due time.    Telegraphic messages from all parts of the United States and Canada in  connection with the point of departure will be received up to 5 o'clock  P. M. of the day of leaving and transmitted over the Placerville and St.  Joseph telegraph wire to San Francisco and intermediate points by the  connecting express, in 8 days.    The letter mail will be delivered in San Francisco in ten days from the  departure of the Express. The Express passes through Forts Kearney,  Laramie, Bridger, Great Salt Lake City, Camp Floyd, Carson City, The  Washoe Silver Mines, Placerville, and Sacramento.    Letters for Oregon, Washington Territory, British Columbia, the Pacific  Mexican ports, Russian Possessions, Sandwich Islands, China, Japan and  India will be mailed in San Francisco.    Special messengers, bearers of letters to connect with the express the  3rd of April, will receive communications for the courier of that day at  No. 481 Tenth St., Washington City, up to 2:45 P. M. on Friday, March  30, and in New York at the office of J. B. Simpson, Room No. 8,  Continental Bank Building, Nassau Street, up to 6:30 A. M. of March 31.    Full particulars can be obtained on application at the above places and  from the agents of the Company.    This sudden announcement of the long desired fast mail route aroused  great enthusiasm in the West and especially in St. Joseph, Missouri,  Salt Lake City, and the cities of California, where preparations to  celebrate the opening of the line were at once begun. Slowly the time  passed, until the afternoon of the eventful day, April 3rd, that was to  mark the first step in annihilating distance between the East and West.  A great crowd had assembled on the streets of St. Joseph, Missouri.  Flags were flying and a brass band added to the jubilation. The Hannibal  and St. Joseph Railroad had arranged to run a special train into the  city, bringing the through mail from connecting points in the East.  Everybody was anxious and excited. At last the shrill whistle of a  locomotive was heard, and the train rumbled in--on time. The pouches  were rushed to the post office where the express mail was made ready.    The people now surge about the old \"Pike's Peak Livery Stables,\" just  South of Pattee Park. All are hushed with subdued expectancy. As the  moment of departure approaches, the doors swing open and a spirited  horse is led out. Nearby, closely inspecting the animal's equipment is a  wiry little man scarcely twenty years old.    Time to go! Everybody back! A pause of seconds, and a cannon booms in  the distance--the starting signal. The rider leaps to his saddle and  starts. In less than a minute he is at the post office where the letter  pouch, square in shape with four padlocked pockets, is awaiting him.  Dismounting only long enough for this pouch to be thrown over his  saddle, he again springs to his place and is gone. A short sprint and he  has reached the Missouri River wharf. A ferry boat under a full head of  steam is waiting. With scarcely checked speed, the horse thunders onto  the deck of the craft. A rumbling of machinery, the jangle of a bell,  the sharp toot of a whistle and the boat has swung clear and is headed  straight for the opposite shore. The crowd behind breaks into tumultuous  applause. Some scream themselves hoarse; others are strangely silent;  and some--strong men--are moved to tears.    The noise of the cheering multitude grows faint as the Kansas shore  draws near. The engines are reversed; a swish of water, and the craft  grates against the dock. Scarcely has the gang plank been lowered than  horse and rider dash over it and are off at a furious gallop. Away on  the jet black steed goes Johnnie Frey, the first rider, with the mail  that must be hurled by flesh and blood over 1,966 miles of desolate  space--across the plains, through North-eastern Kansas and into  Nebraska, up the valley of the Platte, across the Great Plateau, into  the foothills and over the summit of the Rockies, into the arid Great  Basin, over the Wahsatch range, into the valley of Great Salt Lake,  through the terrible alkali deserts of Nevada, through the parched Sink  of the Carson River, over the snowy Sierras, and into the Sacramento  Valley--the mail must go without delay. Neither storms, fatigue,  darkness, rugged mountains, burning deserts, nor savage Indians were to  hinder this pouch of letters. The mail must go; and its schedule,  incredible as it seemed, must be made. It was a sublime undertaking,  than which few have ever put the fibre of Americans to a severer test.    The managers of the Central Overland, California and Pike's Peak Express  Company had laid their plans well. Horses and riders for fresh relays,  together with station agents and helpers, were ready and waiting at the  appointed places, ten or fifteen miles apart over the entire course.  There was no guess-work or delay.    After crossing the Missouri River, out of St. Joseph, the official  route[2] of the west-bound Pony Express ran at first west and south  through Kansas to Kennekuk; then northwest, across the Kickapoo Indian  reservation, to Granada, Log Chain, Seneca, Ash Point, Guittards,  Marysville, and Hollenberg. Here the valley of the Little Blue River was  followed, still in a northwest direction."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4675"],[0,"The Sea-Witch; Or, The African Quadroon: A Story of the Slave Coast (#3)"],[1," about those things, I never seed a  better seaman of twice his years, always savin' present company,  messmates.\"    \"In course, Bill,\" growled three or four of his messmates, heartily.    \"Well, do ye see, messmates, we continued together in the same ship for  the matter of five years, and then master Will and I shipped in another  Indiaman, and we were in the 'Birmingham' for three years or more. One  day we lay off the Cape on the home passage, and a half dozen of us got  shore leave for a few hours, and I among the rest, and somehow I got  rather more grog aboard than I could stow, and when I came off, the  captain swore at me like a pirate, and after I got sober triced me up to  the main rigging for a round dozen. When all hands were called to  witness punishment, shiver my timbers, if master Will Ratlin, who was  the first mate, didn't walk boldly up to the captain, and say, blunt and  honest:    \"'Captain Brace, Marline is an old and favorite seaman, and if you will  let this offence pass without further punishment, I will answer for his  future good behaviour, at all times. I ask it, sir, as a personal  favor.'    \"'But discipline, discipline must be observed, Mr. Ratlin.'    \"'I acknowledge he's in fault, sir,' said our mate.    \"'And deserves the punishment,' said the captain.    \"'I fear he does, sir; but yet I can't bear to see a good seaman  flogged, said the mate, apologetically.    \"'Nor I either,' said the captain; 'but Bill Marline deserves the cat,  though as you make it a personal matter, why I'll let him off this time,  Mr. Ratlin.'    \"The captain didn't wish to let me go, but he said he wished to gratify  his mate, and so I was cast loose, and after a broadside of advice, and  a hurricane of oaths, was turned over to duty again. I didn't forget  that favor, messmates, and sink me if I wouldn't go to the bottom to  serve him any time. He commanded a brig in the South American trade  after that, and would have made a mate of me, but somehow I've got a  weakness for grog that isn't very safe, and so he knows 'twont do. You  see him there now, messmates, as calm as a lady; but he's awake when  there's need of it. The man don't live that can handle a ship better  than he; and as for fighting, do ye see, messmates, we were running on  this here same tack, just off the--but avast upon that, I haven't any  more to say, messmates,\" said the speaker, demurely.    Bill Marline evidently found himself treading upon dangerous ground, and  wisely cut short his yarn, thereby creating a vast amount of curiosity  among his messmates, but he sternly refused to speak further upon the  subject. Either his commander had prohibited him, or he found that by  speaking he should in some way compromise the credit or honor of one  upon whom he evidently looked as being little less than one of a  superior order of beings to himself.    \"But what do you bring up so sudden for? Pay out, old fellow, there's  plenty of sea-room, and no land-sharks to fear,\" said one of the group,  encouragingly.    \"Never you mind, messmates, there's nothing like keeping a civil tongue  in your head, especially being quiet about other people's business,\"  added Bill.    \"What think you, Bill, of this present vocation, eh?\" asked another  companion.    \"I shipped for six months, that's all I know, and no questions asked. I  understand very well that Captain Ratlin wouldn't ship me where he  wouldn't go himself.\"    \"Well, do you see, Bill, most of us are new on board here, though we  have knocked about long enough to get the number of our mess and to work  ship together, and don't perhaps feel so well satisfied as you do.\"    \"Why, look ye, messmates, arnt you satisfied so long as the articles you  signed are kept by captain and crew?\" asked Bill Marline, somewhat  tartly.    \"Why, yes, as to that matter; but where are we bound, Bill?\" asked the  other.    \"Any boy in the ship can make out the 'Sea Witch's' course,\" said the  old tar, evasively. \"We're in these here Northern Trades, close-hauled,  and heading, according to my reckoning, due east, and any man who has  stood his trick at the wheel of a ship, knows that such a course steered  from the West Indies will, if well followed, run down the Cape Verds;  that's all I know.\"    \"Port Praya and a port; that was in the articles sure enough,\" answered  he who had questioned Bill Marline; \"but the 'Sea Witch' will scarce  anchor there before she is off again, according to my reckoning.\"    That the old tar knew more than he chose to divulge, however, was  apparent to his comrades, but they knew him to be fixed when he chose,  and so did not endeavor by importunity to gather anything further from  him; so the conversation gradually changed into some other channel.    In the meantime, while the crew gathered about Bill Marline were thus  speculating, the vessel bowled along gracefully, with a speed that was  in itself exhilarating to her young commander, who still gazed idly at  the passing current. Once or twice a slight frown clouded his features,  and his lips moved as though he was striving within himself either  against real or imaginary evil, and then the same calm, placid manliness  of countenance radiated his handsome features, and his lips were  composed.    Now he turned to issue some necessary order, which was uttered in that  calm, manly distinctness that challenges obedience, and then he resumed  his idle gaze over the vessel's side, once more losing himself in his  day dream.          CHAPTER III.    THE GALE.      \"THE Wind seems to be hauling,\" said the mate, walking aft, and  addressing his superior.    \"Keep her a good full,\" said the captain, to the man at the helm.    \"Ay, ay, sir,\" said the old tar, as he tried to make the sails draw by  altering the vessel's course a point or two more free.    \"Here it is, sure enough,\" said the captain, \"from the southwest. Up  with the men forward once more, Mr. Faulkner!--we must humor our  beauty.\"    \"All hands oil deck!\" shouted the mate at the hatch--an order which as  before was perfectly obeyed.    Almost as quickly as the foremast had been stripped of the square rig it  had at first borne, it was once more clothed again with its topsail and  mainsail, and in less than fifteen minutes the \"Sea Witch\" was under a  cloud of canvass, with studd'nsails out on both sides, while the fore  and aft sails on the main and mizzen were boomed out wing and wing dead  before the wind. The staysails and jibs were hauled down now as useless,  and the vessel flew like a courser. The change of wind had brought the  sea up, and the vessel had a gradual roll, causing the waves now and  then to come gracefully in over the waist, while the extreme fore and  aft parts of the handsome craft were perfectly dry.    \"It has set her to waltzing, Mr. Faulkner,\" said his superior; \"but she  improves her speed upon to it, and I think the breeze freshens from this  new quarter.\"    \"Yes, sir. Do you see the long bank of white hereaway to the  south-southwest; it looks like a fog bank, but may be a squall,\" said  the mate.    \"There are few squalls in these latitudes, Mr. Faulkner, and yet I don't  like the looks of the weather in the southern board,\" said the captain,  as he gazed to windward, with a quick, searching glance.    While he spoke, the wind came fresher and fresher, and now and then a  damp puff and lull, that were too significant tokens for a seaman to  disregard. Captain Ratlin jumped upon the inner braces of the taffrail,  and shading his eyes with his hands for a moment, looked steadily to  windward, then glanced at his well-filled sails as though he was loth to  lose even a minute of such a fair wind. He delayed, however, but a  second, when jumping down to the deck again, he issued his orders in  those brief but significant tones of voice, which at the same time  imparts promptness and confidence in a waiting crew on shipboard.    \"In studd'nsails, gaff-topsails, fore royal and top-gallantsails, with a  will, men, cheerily, cheerily O!\"    These were tones that the crew of the \"Sea Witch\" were no strangers to,  and sounds they loved, for they betokened a thorough and complete  feeling of confidence between commander and men, and they worked with  spirit.    \"Lay aft here, and brail the spanker up!\" continued the captain,  promptly.    \"Ay, ay, sir!\" was the response of a half dozen ready hands, as they  sprang to do his bidding.    The vessel was thus, by the consummation of these orders, quickly  reduced to her mainsail, foresail, and foretopsail, while she flew  before the on-coming gale at the rate of seventeen or eighteen knots an  hour, being actually much faster than the sea. It was now evident to  every one on board that a severe gale of wind was gathering, and its  force was momentarily more powerfully exercised upon the vessel.    \"She staggers under it, Mr. Faulkner,\" said his superior, with a  calmness that evinced perfect self-reliance and coolness, while he  regarded the increasing gale.    \"Ay, sir, you can drive her at almost any speed,\" answered the mate.  \"She's like a mettled courser, sir, and loves the fleet track.\"    \"Scud while you can, Mr. Faulkner, it's a true nautical rule. Some men  will always heave a ship to if there is a cap fill of--\"    \"Double-reef the mainsail!\" shouted the captain, interrupting himself,  to give an order that he saw was imperative.    \"--Wind, but I believe in scudding, if you can,\" he added.    \"Double-reef foretopsail! and look ye, Mr. Faulkner, have presenter  sheets bent on the foresail, this wind is in earnest,\" said his  superior, more seriously, as he jumped into the mizzen shrouds and  scanned the sea to windward again.    The gale still increased, and everything being now made snug on board  the \"Sea Witch,\" she was run before it with almost incredible speed. It  would have been a study to have regarded the calm self-possession and  complete coolness of the young commander"]]]
