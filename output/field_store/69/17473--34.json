Then after a bit the father began to  wonder that they didn't come back, and he went down into the cellar to  look after them himself, and there they two sat a-crying, and the beer  running all over the floor. \"Whatever is the matter?\" says he. \"Why,\"  says the mother, \"look at that horrid mallet. Just suppose, if our  daughter and her sweetheart was to be married, and was to have a son,  and he was to grow up, and was to come down into the cellar to draw  the beer, and the mallet was to fall on his head and kill him, what a  dreadful thing it would be!\" \"Dear, dear, dear! so it would!\" said the  father, and he sat himself down aside of the other two, and started  a-crying.    Now the gentleman got tired of stopping up in the kitchen by himself,  and at last he went down into the cellar too, to see what they were  after; and there they three sat a-crying side by side, and the beer  running all over the floor. And he ran straight and turned the tap.  Then he said: \"Whatever are you three doing, sitting there crying, and  letting the beer run all over the floor?\"    \"Oh!\" says the father, \"look at that horrid mallet! Suppose you and our  daughter was to be married, and was to have a son, and he was to grow  up, and was to come down into the cellar to draw the beer, and the  mallet was to fall on his head and kill him!\" And then they all started  a-crying worse than before. But the gentleman burst out a-laughing, and  reached up and pulled out the mallet, and then he said: \"I've travelled  many miles, and I never met three such big sillies as you three before;  and now I shall start out on my travels again, and when I can find  three bigger sillies than you three, then I'll come back and marry your  daughter.\" So he wished them good-bye, and started off on his travels,  and left them all crying because the girl had lost her sweetheart.    Well, he set out, and he travelled a long way, and at last he came to a  woman's cottage that had some grass growing on the roof. And the woman  was trying to get her cow to go up a ladder to the grass, and the poor  thing durst not go. So the gentleman asked the woman what she was doing.  \"Why, lookye,\" she said, \"look at all that beautiful grass. I'm going to  get the cow on to the roof to eat it. She'll be quite safe, for I shall  tie a string round her neck, and pass it down the chimney, and tie it  to my wrist as I go about the house, so she can't fall off without my  knowing it.\" \"Oh, you poor silly!\" said the gentleman, \"you should cut  the grass and throw it down to the cow!\" But the woman thought it was  easier to get the cow up the ladder than to get the grass down, so she  pushed her and coaxed her and got her up, and tied a string round her  neck, and passed it down the chimney, and fastened it to her own wrist.  And the gentleman went on his way, but he hadn't gone far when the cow  tumbled off the roof, and hung by the string tied round her neck, and  it strangled her. And the weight of the cow tied to her wrist pulled the  woman up the chimney, and she stuck fast half-way and was smothered in  the soot.    Well, that was one big silly.    And the gentleman went on and on, and he went to an inn to stop the  night, and they were so full at the inn that they had to put him in a  double-bedded room, and another traveller was to sleep in the other bed.  The other man was a very pleasant fellow, and they got very friendly  together; but in the morning, when they were both getting up, the  gentleman was surprised to see the other hang his trousers on the knobs  of the chest of drawers and run across the room and try to jump into  them, and he tried over and over again, and couldn't manage it; and the  gentleman wondered whatever he was doing it for. At last he stopped and  wiped his face with his handkerchief. \"Oh dear,\" he says, \"I do think  trousers are the most awkwardest kind of clothes that ever were. I can't  think who could have invented such things. It takes me the best part  of an hour to get into mine every morning, and I get so hot! How do you  manage yours?\" So the gentleman burst out a-laughing, and showed him how  to put them on; and he was very much obliged to him, and said he never  should have thought of doing it that way.    So that was another big silly.    Then the gentleman went on his travels again; and he came to a village,  and outside the village there was a pond, and round the pond was a crowd  of people. And they had got rakes, and brooms, and pitchforks, reaching  into the pond; and the gentleman asked what was the matter. \"Why,\" they  say, \"matter enough! Moon's tumbled into the pond, and we can't rake  her out anyhow!\" So the gentleman burst out a-laughing, and told them to  look up into the sky, and that it was only the shadow in the water. But  they wouldn't listen to him, and abused him shamefully, and he got away  as quick as he could.    So there was a whole lot of sillies bigger than them three sillies at  home. So the gentleman turned back home again and married the farmer's  daughter, and if they didn't live happy for ever after, that's nothing  to do with you or me.          THE ROSE-TREE    There was once upon a time a good man who had two children: a girl by a  first wife, and a boy by the second. The girl was as white as milk, and  her lips were like cherries. Her hair was like golden silk, and it hung  to the ground. Her brother loved her dearly, but her wicked stepmother  hated her. \"Child,\" said the stepmother one day, \"go to the grocer's  shop and buy me a pound of candles.\" She gave her the money; and the  little girl went, bought the candles, and started on her return. There  was a stile to cross. She put down the candles whilst she got over the  stile. Up came a dog and ran off with the candles.    She went back to the grocer's, and she got a second bunch. She came to  the stile, set down the candles, and proceeded to climb over. Up came  the dog and ran off with the candles.    She went again to the grocer's, and she got a third bunch; and just the  same happened. Then she came to her stepmother crying, for she had spent  all the money and had lost three bunches of candles.    The stepmother was angry, but she pretended not to mind the loss. She  said to the child: \"Come, lay your head on my lap that I may comb your  hair.\" So the little one laid her head in the woman's lap, who proceeded  to comb the yellow silken hair. And when she combed the hair fell over  her knees, and rolled right down to the ground.    Then the stepmother hated her more for the beauty of her hair; so she  said to her, \"I cannot part your hair on my knee, fetch a billet of  wood.\" So she fetched it. Then said the stepmother, \"I cannot part your  hair with a comb, fetch me an axe.\" So she fetched it.    \"Now,\" said the wicked woman, \"lay your head down on the billet whilst I  part your hair.\"    Well! she laid down her little golden head without fear; and whist! down  came the axe, and it was off. So the mother wiped the axe and laughed.    Then she took the heart and liver of the little girl, and she stewed  them and brought them into the house for supper. The husband tasted them  and shook his head. He said they tasted very strangely. She gave some  to the little boy, but he would not eat. She tried to force him, but he  refused, and ran out into the garden, and took up his little sister, and  put her in a box, and buried the box under a rose-tree; and every day he  went to the tree and wept, till his tears ran down on the box.    One day the rose-tree flowered. It was spring, and there among the  flowers was a white bird; and it sang, and sang, and sang like an  angel out of heaven. Away it flew, and it went to a cobbler's shop, and  perched itself on a tree hard by; and thus it sang,      \"My wicked mother slew me,    My dear father ate me,    My little brother whom I love    Sits below, and I sing above      Stick, stock, stone dead.\"    \"Sing again that beautiful song,\" asked the shoemaker. \"If you will  first give me those little red shoes you are making.\" The cobbler gave  the shoes, and the bird sang the song; then flew to a tree in front of a  watchmaker's, and sang:      \"My wicked mother slew me,    My dear father ate me,    My little brother whom I love    Sits below, and I sing above      Stick, stock, stone dead.\"    \"Oh, the beautiful song! sing it again, sweet bird,\" asked the  watchmaker. \"If you will give me first that gold watch and chain in your  hand.\" The jeweller gave the watch and chain. The bird took it in one  foot, the shoes in the other, and, after having repeated the song, flew  away to where three millers were picking a millstone. The bird perched  on a tree and sang:      \"My wicked mother slew me,    My dear father ate me,    My little brother whom I love    Sits below, and I sing above      Stick!\"    Then one of the men put down his tool and looked up from his work,      \"Stock!\"    Then the second miller's man laid aside his tool and looked up,      \"Stone!\"    Then the third miller's man laid down his tool and looked up,      \"Dead!\"    Then all three cried out with one voice: \"Oh, what a beautiful song!  Sing it, sweet bird, again.\" \"If you will put the millstone round my  neck,\" said the bird. The men did what the bird wanted and away to the  tree it flew with the millstone round its neck, the red shoes in one  foot, and the gold watch and chain in the other. It sang the song and  then flew home. It rattled the millstone against the eaves of the house,  and the stepmother said: \"It thunders.\" Then the little boy ran out to  see the thunder, and down dropped the red shoes at his feet. It  rattled the millstone against the eaves of the house once more, and the  stepmother said again: \"It thunders.\" Then"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7440"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#3)"],[1,"to very little original research on his  part.  He says himself in his Address to the Reader: \"As I have no opportunity  of consulting public libraries, the manuscripts of which I have made use  throughout the whole work have been such as I had in my own study, except only  the Commentary of Al Baidhâwi\" . . . which \"belongs to the library of the  Dutch Church in Austin Friars.\"   Now with regard to these manuscripts which Sale had in his \"own study\"  we happen to possess first-hand information, for a list of them was printed by  the executor of his will under the following title: \"A choice collection of  most curious and inestimable manuscripts in the Turkish, Arabic and Persian  languages from the library of the late learned and ingenious Mr. George Sale.  Which books are now in the possession of Mr. William Hammerton Merchant in  Lothbury where they may be seen on Wednesdays and Fridays till either they are  sold or sent abroad.  N.B. These MSS. are to be sold together and not  separately.\"  They were purchased in the first instance by the Rev. Thomas  Hunt of Oxford for the Radcliffe Library, and they are now permanently housed  in the Bodleian Library.   The British Museum possesses a copy of this list which is drawn up in  English and French on opposite pages and comprises eighty-six works in all.  The list contains very few Arabic works of first-rate importance, but is rich  in Turkish and Persian Histories.  What is most significant, however, is the  fact that it contains hardly any of the Arabic works and none of the  Commentaries which are referred to on every page of Sale's translation of the  Korân.   I have therefore been forced to the conclusion that with the exception  of Al-Baidhâwi, Sale's sources were all consulted at second hand; and an  examination of Marracci's great work makes the whole matter perfectly clear.  Sale says of Marracci's translation that it is \"generally speaking very exact;  but adheres to the Arabic idiom too literally to be easily understood . . . by  those who are not versed in the Muhammadan learning.  The notes he has added  are indeed of great use; but his refutations, which swell the work to a large  volume, are of little or none at all, being often unsatisfactory, and  sometimes impertinent.  The work, however, with all its faults is very  valuable, and I should be guilty of ingratitude, did I not acknowledge myself  much obliged thereto; but still being in Latin it can be of no use to those  who understand not that tongue.\"   Such is Sale's own confession of his obligation to Marracci-but it does  not go nearly far enough.  A comparison of the two versions shows that so much  had been achieved by Marracci that Sale's work might almost have been  performed with a knowledge of Latin alone, as far as regards the quotations  from Arabic authors.  I do not wish to imply that Sale did not know Arabic,  but I do maintain that his work as it stands gives a misleading estimate of  his original researches, and that his tribute to Marracci falls far short of  his actual indebtedness.   It must be mentioned that Marracci not only reproduced the whole of the  Arabic text of the Korân but furthermore gives the original text and the  translation of all his quotations from Arabic writers.  It is indeed a  profoundly learned work and has never received the recognition it deserves.  Marracci had at his disposal rich collections of MSS. belonging to the  Libraries of Italy.  How he learnt his Arabic we do not know.  Voltaire says  he was never in the East.  He was confessor to Pope Innocent XI, and his work  which appeared in Padua in 1698 is dedicated to the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold  I.  By way of Introduction to his Korân Marracci published a companion folio  volume called Prodromus which contains practically all that was known in his  day regarding Muhammad and the Religion of Islam.   It may in any case be claimed that the present work presents to the  Western student all the essentials of a preliminary study of Islam: for Sale's  translation and footnotes will give him as clear an idea as can be obtained,  without laborious years of study in Arabic, of what is regarded by so many  millions of men from Fez to the Far East as the revealed word of God and the  unshakable basis of their faith.   George Sale was born about 1697 and died in 1736.  Every biography calls  attention to the statement made by Voltaire in his Dictionnaire Philosophique  to the effect that Sale spent over twenty years among the Arabs.  I think this  must have been a lapsus calami on Voltaire's part, because it is unlikely that  he would have invented such a story.  Sale must also have been well versed in  Hebrew, both biblical and post-biblical, as his numerous allusions to  Rabbinical writings testify.   Two years after the publication of his great work Sale died in Surrey  Street, Strand, his age being then under forty.  In 1720 he had been admitted  a student of the Inner Temple-son of Samuel Sale, citizen and merchant of  London-and the same year the Patriarch of Antioch had sent Solomon Negri  (Suleiman Alsadi) to London from Damascus to urge the Society for Promoting  Christian Knowledge, then established in the Middle Temple, to issue an Arabic  New Testament for the Syrian Christians.  It is surmised that Negri was Sale's  first instructor in Arabic, though Dadichi, the King's Interpreter, a learned  Greek of Aleppo, guided him, we are told, \"through the labyrinth of oriental  dialects.\"   Whatever Sale may have known before-and he certainly had the gift of  languages-it is on the Society's records that on August 30, 1726, he offered  his services as one of the correctors of the Arabic New Testament and soon  became the chief worker on it, besides being the Society's solicitor and  holding other honorary offices.  That translation of the New Testament into  Arabic was followed by the translation of the Korân into English.   In this edition the proper names have been left for the most part as in  the original, but the reader must understand that in Sale's day there was a  freedom in regard to oriental orthography that allowed of many variations.  In  spite, however, of the want of a scientific system, Sale's transcription is on  the whole clear, and far less confusing than those adopted by contemporary  Anglo-Indian scholars, who utterly distorted Muhammadan names-including place  names in India-by rendering the short a by u and so forth.  As a few examples  of names spelled in more than one way, the correct modern way being given  first, we have Al-Qor'án, Coran, Korân, etc.; Muhammad, Mohammed, Mahomet,  etc.; Al-Baidhâwi, Al-Beidâwi; Muttalib, Motalleb, Motaleb, etc.; Jalâl ud-  Dîn, Jallâlo'ddîn; Anas, Ans; Khalîfa, Caliph, Khalif, etc.   It is only within quite recent times that scholars have troubled to  render each letter of the Arabic alphabet by an equivalent and distinct letter  of the Roman alphabet-and although no particular system has been universally  adopted by European orientalists, every writer has some system by which any  reader with a knowledge of Arabic is able to turn back every name into the  original script.  The chief advantage of any such system is that a distinction  is made between the two varieties of s, k, and t, and the presence of the  illusive Arabic letter 'ayn is always indicated.       E. DENISON ROSS.        Sir Edward Denison Ross  C.I.E., Ph.D., ETC.    [Written apparently sometime after 1877]      TO THE READER.    _______    I IMAGINE it almost needless either to make an apology for publishing the  following translation, or to go about to prove it a work of use as well as  curiosity.  They must have a mean opinion of the Christian religion, or be but  ill grounded therein, who can apprehend any danger from so manifest a forgery:  and if the religious and civil institutions of foreign nations are worth our  knowledge, those of Mohammed, the lawgiver of the Arabians, and founder of an  empire which in less than a century spread itself over a greater part of the  world than the Romans were ever masters of, must needs be so; whether we  consider their extensive obtaining, or our frequent intercourse with those who  are governed thereby.  I shall not here inquire into the reasons why the law  of Mohammed has met with so unexampled a reception in the world (for they are  greatly deceived who imagine it to have been propagated by the sword alone),  or by what means it came to be embraced by nations which never felt the force  of the Mohammedan arms, and even by those which stripped the Arabians of their  conquests, and put an end to the sovereignty and very being of their Khalîfs:  yet it seems as if there was something more than what is vulgarly imagined in  a religion which has made so surprising a progress.  But whatever use an  impartial version of the Korân may be of in other respects, it is absolutely  necessary to undeceive those who, from the ignorant or unfair translations  which have appeared, have entertained too favourable an opinion of the  original, and also to enable us effectually to expose the imposture; none of  those who have hitherto undertaken that province, not excepting Dr. Prideaux  himself, having succeeded to the satisfaction of the judicious, for want of  being complete masters of the controversy.  The writers of the Romish  communion, in particular, are so far from having done any service in their  refutations of Mohammedism, that by endeavouring to defend their idolatry and  other superstitions, they have rather contributed to the increase of that  aversion which the Mohammedans in general have to the Christian religion, and  given them great advantages in the dispute.  The Protestants alone are able to  attack the Korân with success; and for them, I trust, Providence has reserved  the glory of its overthrow.  In the meantime, if I might presume to lay down  rules to be observed by those who attempt the conversion of the Mohammedans, "]]]
