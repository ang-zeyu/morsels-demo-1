Sleek unwieldy porkers were  grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens, from whence sallied  forth, now and then, troops of sucking pigs, as if to snuff the air.  A stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond,  convoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling  through the farmyard, and Guinea fowls fretting about it, like  ill-tempered housewives, with their peevish, discontented cry. Before  the barn door strutted the gallant cock, that pattern of a husband, a  warrior and a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings and crowing  in the pride and gladness of his heart,--sometimes tearing up the earth  with his feet, and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of  wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered.    The pedagogue's mouth watered as he looked upon this sumptuous promise  of luxurious winter fare. In his devouring mind's eye, he pictured to  himself every roasting-pig running about with a pudding in his belly,  and an apple in his mouth; the pigeons were snugly put to bed in a  comfortable pie, and tucked in with a coverlet of crust; the geese were  swimming in their own gravy; and the ducks pairing cosily in dishes,  like snug married couples, with a decent competency of onion sauce. In  the porkers he saw carved out the future sleek side of bacon, and juicy  relishing ham; not a turkey but he beheld daintily trussed up, with  its gizzard under its wing, and, peradventure, a necklace of savory  sausages; and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back,  in a side dish, with uplifted claws, as if craving that quarter which  his chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living.    As the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this, and as he rolled his great  green eyes over the fat meadow lands, the rich fields of wheat, of rye,  of buckwheat, and Indian corn, and the orchards burdened with ruddy  fruit, which surrounded the warm tenement of Van Tassel, his heart  yearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains, and his  imagination expanded with the idea, how they might be readily turned  into cash, and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land, and  shingle palaces in the wilderness. Nay, his busy fancy already realized  his hopes, and presented to him the blooming Katrina, with a whole  family of children, mounted on the top of a wagon loaded with household  trumpery, with pots and kettles dangling beneath; and he beheld himself  bestriding a pacing mare, with a colt at her heels, setting out for  Kentucky, Tennessee,--or the Lord knows where!    When he entered the house, the conquest of his heart was complete. It  was one of those spacious farmhouses, with high-ridged but lowly sloping  roofs, built in the style handed down from the first Dutch settlers; the  low projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front, capable of being  closed up in bad weather. Under this were hung flails, harness, various  utensils of husbandry, and nets for fishing in the neighboring  river. Benches were built along the sides for summer use; and a great  spinning-wheel at one end, and a churn at the other, showed the various  uses to which this important porch might be devoted. From this piazza  the wondering Ichabod entered the hall, which formed the centre of the  mansion, and the place of usual residence. Here rows of resplendent  pewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his eyes. In one corner  stood a huge bag of wool, ready to be spun; in another, a quantity of  linsey-woolsey just from the loom; ears of Indian corn, and strings of  dried apples and peaches, hung in gay festoons along the walls, mingled  with the gaud of red peppers; and a door left ajar gave him a peep into  the best parlor, where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables  shone like mirrors; andirons, with their accompanying shovel and  tongs, glistened from their covert of asparagus tops; mock-oranges and  conch-shells decorated the mantelpiece; strings of various-colored birds  eggs were suspended above it; a great ostrich egg was hung from  the centre of the room, and a corner cupboard, knowingly left open,  displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china.    From the moment Ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of delight, the  peace of his mind was at an end, and his only study was how to gain the  affections of the peerless daughter of Van Tassel. In this enterprise,  however, he had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of  a knight-errant of yore, who seldom had anything but giants, enchanters,  fiery dragons, and such like easily conquered adversaries, to contend  with and had to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass,  and walls of adamant to the castle keep, where the lady of his heart was  confined; all which he achieved as easily as a man would carve his way  to the centre of a Christmas pie; and then the lady gave him her hand as  a matter of course. Ichabod, on the contrary, had to win his way to  the heart of a country coquette, beset with a labyrinth of whims  and caprices, which were forever presenting new difficulties and  impediments; and he had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries of  real flesh and blood, the numerous rustic admirers, who beset every  portal to her heart, keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other,  but ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor.    Among these, the most formidable was a burly, roaring, roystering blade,  of the name of Abraham, or, according to the Dutch abbreviation, Brom  Van Brunt, the hero of the country round, which rang with his feats of  strength and hardihood. He was broad-shouldered and double-jointed,  with short curly black hair, and a bluff but not unpleasant countenance,  having a mingled air of fun and arrogance. From his Herculean frame  and great powers of limb he had received the nickname of BROM BONES,  by which he was universally known. He was famed for great knowledge and  skill in horsemanship, being as dexterous on horseback as a Tartar.  He was foremost at all races and cock fights; and, with the ascendancy  which bodily strength always acquires in rustic life, was the umpire in  all disputes, setting his hat on one side, and giving his decisions with  an air and tone that admitted of no gainsay or appeal. He was always  ready for either a fight or a frolic; but had more mischief than  ill-will in his composition; and with all his overbearing roughness,  there was a strong dash of waggish good humor at bottom. He had three or  four boon companions, who regarded him as their model, and at the  head of whom he scoured the country, attending every scene of feud or  merriment for miles round. In cold weather he was distinguished by a  fur cap, surmounted with a flaunting fox's tail; and when the folks at a  country gathering descried this well-known crest at a distance, whisking  about among a squad of hard riders, they always stood by for a squall.  Sometimes his crew would be heard dashing along past the farmhouses at  midnight, with whoop and halloo, like a troop of Don Cossacks; and the  old dames, startled out of their sleep, would listen for a moment till  the hurry-scurry had clattered by, and then exclaim, \"Ay, there goes  Brom Bones and his gang!\" The neighbors looked upon him with a mixture  of awe, admiration, and good-will; and, when any madcap prank or rustic  brawl occurred in the vicinity, always shook their heads, and warranted  Brom Bones was at the bottom of it.    This rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming Katrina  for the object of his uncouth gallantries, and though his amorous  toyings were something like the gentle caresses and endearments of a  bear, yet it was whispered that she did not altogether discourage his  hopes. Certain it is, his advances were signals for rival candidates to  retire, who felt no inclination to cross a lion in his amours; insomuch,  that when his horse was seen tied to Van Tassel's paling, on a Sunday  night, a sure sign that his master was courting, or, as it is termed,  \"sparking,\" within, all other suitors passed by in despair, and carried  the war into other quarters.    Such was the formidable rival with whom Ichabod Crane had to contend,  and, considering all things, a stouter man than he would have shrunk  from the competition, and a wiser man would have despaired. He had,  however, a happy mixture of pliability and perseverance in his nature;  he was in form and spirit like a supple-jack--yielding, but tough;  though he bent, he never broke; and though he bowed beneath the  slightest pressure, yet, the moment it was away--jerk!--he was as erect,  and carried his head as high as ever.    To have taken the field openly against his rival would have been  madness; for he was not a man to be thwarted in his amours, any more  than that stormy lover, Achilles. Ichabod, therefore, made his advances  in a quiet and gently insinuating manner. Under cover of his character  of singing-master, he made frequent visits at the farmhouse; not that he  had anything to apprehend from the meddlesome interference of parents,  which is so often a stumbling-block in the path of lovers. Balt Van  Tassel was an easy indulgent soul; he loved his daughter better even  than his pipe, and, like a reasonable man and an excellent father, let  her have her way in everything. His notable little wife, too, had enough  to do to attend to her housekeeping and manage her poultry; for, as she  sagely observed, ducks and geese are foolish things, and must be looked  after, but girls can take "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41017"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 5 (of 8) (#3)"],[1,"same kind. He said, \"It was just  like walking into a cloak-room--the Boers politely took your rifle and  asked you kindly to step on one side, and there was nothing else you  could do!\"    The nicety of the situation from the Boer point of view was described by  a correspondent of _The Times_:--    \"The camp was about three miles from the drift, which lay in the point  of a rough angle made by an embankment under construction and the  bush-grown sluit which converged towards it. Thus when the Boers were in  position, lining the sluit and the embankment, the position became like  the base of a horse's foot. The Boers were the metal shoe, our own  troops the frog. At the point where the drift cuts the sluit the nullah  is broad and extensive. The Boers stationed at this spot realised that  the baggage was moving without an advanced guard. They were equal to the  situation. As each waggon dropped below the sky-line into the drift the  teamsters were directed to take their teams to right or left as the case  might be, and the guards were disarmed under threat of violence. No shot  was fired. Each waggon in turn was captured and placed along the sluit,  so that those in rear had no knowledge of what was taking place to their  front until it became their turn to surrender. To all intents and  purposes the convoy was proceeding forward. The scrub and high ground  beyond the drift was sufficient to mask the clever contrivance of the  enemy. Thus all the waggons except nine passed into the hands of the  enemy.\"    The waggons, numbering some hundred, had no sooner descended to the  spruit and got bogged there than, from all sides sprung up as from the  earth, Boers with rifles at the present, shouting--\"Hands up. Give up  your bandoliers.\" A scene of appalling confusion followed. Some cocked  their revolvers. Others were weaponless. So unsuspecting of danger had  they been that their rifles, for comfort's sake, had been stowed on the  waggons, the better to allow of freedom to assist in other operations of  transport. Some men of the baggage guard shouldered their rifles;  others, from under the medley of waggons, still strove ineffectually to  show fight. The Boers were unavoidably in the ascendant. The hour and  the opportunity were theirs.    [Illustration: PLAN--DISASTER AT KOORN SPRUIT.]    At this time up came U Battery, with Roberts's Horse on their left. The  battery was surrounded, armed Boers roared--\"You must surrender!\" and  then, sharp and clear, the first shot rang through the air. This was  said to have been fired by Sergeant Green, Army Service Corps, who,  refusing to surrender, had shot his antagonist, and had instantly fallen  victim to his grand temerity. The drivers of the batteries were ordered  to dismount, but as gunners don't dismount graciously to order of the  foe, the tragedy pursued its course. Major Taylor, commanding the  battery, however, succeeded in galloping off to warn the officer  commanding Q Battery of the catastrophe. Meanwhile, in that serene and  pastoral spruit reigned fire and fury and the clash of frenzied men.  Down went a horse--another, another. Then man after man--groaning and  reeling in their agony. Many in the spruit lay dead. At this time the  troop of Roberts's Horse had appeared on the scene, and were called on  to surrender. Realising the disaster, they wheeled about, and galloped  to report and bring assistance. This was the signal for more volleys  from the enemy in the spruit, and the horsemen thus sped between two  fires--that of the Mausers below them and of the shells which had  continued to harry the troops. Nevertheless the gallant fellows rode  furiously for dear life on their journey. Men dropped from their saddles  like ripe fruit from a shaken tree. Still they sped on. They must bring  help at any price. Meanwhile the scene in the spruit was one of horror,  for the Boers were sweeping every nook and corner with their Mausers.  Cascades of fire played on the unfortunate mass therein entangled, on  waggons overturned and squealing mules, on guns and horses hopelessly  heaped together, on men and oxen sweating and plunging in death-agony.  The heaving, struggling, horrific picture was too grievous for  description. Only a part of their terrible experience was known by even  the actors themselves. Luckily, a merciful Providence allows each human  intelligence to gauge only a certain amount of the awful in tragic  experience. There are some who told of wounded men lying blood-bathed  and helpless beneath baggage that weighed like the stone of Sisyphus; of  horses that uttered weird screams of agonised despair, which petrified  the veins of hearers and sent the current of blood to their hearts; of  oxen and mules that stamped and kicked, dealing ugly wounds, so that  those who might have crawled out from under them could crawl no more.  Some guns were overturned--a hopeless bulk of iron, that resisted all  efforts at removal; others, bereft of their drivers, were dragged wildly  into space by maddened teams, whose happy instinct had caused them to  stampede. Seeing the disaster, they had pulled out to left and struggled  to get back to camp, yet even as they struggled they were disabled and  thus left at the mercy of the foe.    Major Burnham, the famous scout, who having been taken a prisoner  earlier and at this juncture remained powerless in the hands of the  Boers, thus described the terrible sight which he was forced to  witness:--    \"One of the batteries (Q), which was upon the outside of the  three-banked rows of waggons, halted at the spruit, dashed off,  following Roberts's Horse to the rear and south. Yet most of them got  clear, although horses and men fell at every step, and the guns were  being dragged off with only part of their teams, animals falling wounded  by the way. Then I saw the battery, when but 1200 yards from the spruit,  wheel round into firing position, unlimber, and go into action at that  range, so as to save comrades and waggons from capture. Who gave the  order for that deed of self-sacrifice I don't know. It may have been a  sergeant or lieutenant, for their commanding officer had been left  behind at the time. One of the guns upset in wheeling, caused by the  downfall of wounded horses. There it lay afterwards, whilst three steeds  for a long time fought madly to free themselves from the traces and the  presence of their dead stable companions.\"    Those of the unfortunate men who were uninjured struggled grandly to  save the guns, to drag them free from the scene of destruction, but  several of the guns whose teams were shot fell into the hands of the  enemy. Some gallant fellows of Rimington's Scouts made a superb effort  to rush through the fire of the Federals and save them, but five guns  only were rescued. These were all guns of Q Battery, which, when the  first alarm was given, were within 300 yards of the spruit. When the  officer who commanded the battery strove to wheel about, though the  Boers took up a second position and poured a heavy fire on the galloping  teams, a wheel horse was shot, over went a gun, more beasts dropped, a  waggon was rendered useless, but still the teams that remained were  galloped through the confusion to the shelter of some tin buildings,  part of an unfinished railway station, some 1150 yards from the  disastrous scene. Here a new era began. Much to the amazement of the  Boers, the guns came into action, and continued, in the face of horrible  carnage, to make heroic efforts at retaliation, the officers themselves  assisting in serving the guns till ordered to retire. At this time Q  Battery was assailed by a terrific cross fire, and gradually the numbers  of the gunners and horses became thinned, till the ground, covered with  riderless steeds and dismounted and disabled men, presented a picture of  writhing agony and stern heroism that has seldom been equalled. But the  splendid effort had grand results.    No sooner were the British guns in action than the whole force rallied:  the situation was saved. The Household Cavalry and the 10th Hussars were  off in one direction, Rimington's Scouts and the mounted infantry in  another, making for some rising ground on the left where their position  would be defensible and a line of retreat found. Meanwhile Q Battery  from six till noon pounded away at the Dutchmen, while Lieutenant  Chester-Master, K.R.R., found a passage farther down the spruit  unoccupied by the enemy, by which it was possible to effect a crossing.  Major Burnham's account of the artillery duelling at this time is  inspiriting:--         \"As soon as the gunners manning the five guns opened with       shrapnel, the Boers hiding in Koorn Spruit slackened their       fire, preferring to keep under cover as much as possible. In       that way many others escaped. The mounted infantry deployed and       engaged the Boer gunners and skirmishers to the east, and the       cavalry with Roberts's Horse dismounted and rallied to cover       the guns from the fire. A small body was also despatched to       strike south and fight north. My captors directed their       attention to Q Battery. They got the range, 1700 yards, by one       of the Boers firing at contiguous bare ground, until he saw by       the dust puffs he had got the distance, whereupon he gave the       others the exact range, which they at once adopted. The gunners       gave us nearly forty-eight shrapnel, for they were firing very       rapidly, but although they had the range of our kraal, they       only managed to kill one horse. I noticed that the Boers,       though they dodged and took every advantage of cover, fired       most carefully, and yet rapidly. It was the same with those in       the spruit as inside the kraal where I sat. That day the Boers       said to me they had but three men killed in the spruit, and       only a half-dozen or so wounded. Those artillerymen, how I       admired and"]]]
