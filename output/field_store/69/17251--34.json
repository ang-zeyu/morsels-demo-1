There was an agricultural revolution from the two-field system  in which one field was fallow to the three-field system, in which there  were three large fields for the heavy and fertile land. Each field was  divided into long and narrow strips. Each strip represented a day's  work with the plough. One field had wheat, or perhaps rye, another had  barley, oats, beans, or peas, and the third was fallow. It had been  observed that legumes such as peas and beans restored the soil. These  were rotated yearly. There was a newly invented plough that was heavy  and made of wood and later had an attached iron blade. The plough had a  mould-board which caught the soil stirred by the plough blade and threw  it into a ridge alongside the furrow dug by the plough blade. This  plough was too heavy for two oxen and was pulled by a team of about  eight to ten oxen. Each ox was owned by a different man as was the  plough, because no one peasant could afford the complete set. Each  freeman was allotted certain strips in each field to bear crops. His  strips were far from each other, which insured some very fertile and  some only fair soil, and some land near his village dwelling and some  far away. These strips he cultivated, sowed with seed, and harvested  for himself and his family. After the harvest, they reverted to common  ownership for grazing by pigs, sheep, and geese. As soon as haymaking  was over, the meadows became common grazing land for horses, cows, and  oxen. Not just any inhabitant, but usually only those who owned a piece  of land in the parish were entitled to graze their animals on the  common land, and each owner had this right of pasture for a definite  number of animals. The faster horse replaced the ox as the primary work  animal. Other farm implements were: coulters, which gave free passage  to the plough by cutting weeds and turf, picks, spades and shovels,  reaping hooks and scythes, and sledge hammers and anvils. Strips of  land for agriculture were added from waste land as the community grew.  Waste lands were moors bristling with brushwood, or gorse, heather and  wanton weeds, reed-coated marshes, quaking peat-bogs, or woods grown  haphazard on sand or rock. With iron axes, forests could be cleared to  provide more arable land.            Some villages had a smith, a wheelwright, and a cooper. There  were villages which had one or two market days in each week. Cattle,  sheep, pigs, poultry, calves, and hare were sold there. London was a  town on the Thames River under the protection of the Celtic river god  Lud: Lud's town. It's huts were probably built over the water, as was  Celtic custom. It was a port for foreign trade. Near the town was  Ludhill. Each Celtic tribe in England made its own coinage. Silver and  bronze were first used, and then gold. The metal was put into a round  form and then placed between two engraved dies, which were hit.            Flint workers mined with deer antler picks and ox shoulder  blade shovels for flint to grind into axes, spearheads, and arrowheads.  Mine shafts were up to thirty feet deep and necessitated the use of  chalk lamps fueled by animal fat with wicks of moss. The flint was  hauled up in baskets.            Common men and women were now buried in tombs within memorial  burial mounds of earth with stone entrances and interior chambers. A  man's weapons and shield were buried with him and a woman's spindle and  weaving baton, and perhaps beads or pottery with her. At times, mounds  of earth would simply be covered over piles of corpses and ashes in  urns. In these mass graves, some corpses had spear holes or sword cuts,  indicating death by violence. The Druid priests, the learned class of  the Celts, taught the Celts to believe in reincarnation of the soul  after death of one body into another body. They also threw prized  possessions into lakes and rivers as sacrifices to water gods. They  placed images of gods and goddesses in shrines, which were sometimes  large enough to be temples. They thought of their gods as supernatural  magicians.            With the ability to grow food and the acquisition of land by  conquest by invading groups, the population grew. There were different  classes of men. The freemen were eorls [noble freemen] or ceorls  [ordinary free farmers]. Slaves were not free. Freemen had long hair  and beards. Slaves' hair was shorn from their heads so that they were  bald. Slaves were chained and often traded. Prisoners taken in battle,  especially native Britons taken by invading groups, became slaves. A  slave who was captured or purchased was a \"theow\". An \"esne\" was a  slave who worked for hire. A \"weallas\" was a Welsh slave. Criminals  became slaves of the person wronged or of the king. Sometimes a father  pressed by need sold his children or his wife into bondage. Debtors,  who increased in number during famine, which occurred regularly, became  slaves by giving up the freeman's sword and spear, picking up a slave's  mattock [pick ax for the soils], and placing their head within a lord's  or lady's hands. They were called wite- theows. The original meaning of  the word lord was \"loaf-giver\". Children with a slave parent were  slaves. The slaves lived in huts around the homes of big landholders,  which were made of logs and consisted on one large room or hall. An  open hearth was in the middle of the earthen floor of the hall, which  was strewn with rushes. There was a hole in the roof to let out the  smoke. Here the landholder and his men would eat meat, bread, salt, hot  spiced ale, and mead while listening to minstrels sing about the heroic  deeds of their ancestors. Richer men drank wine. There were festivals  which lasted several days, in which warriors feasted, drank, gambled,  boasted, and slept where they fell. Physical strength and endurance in  adversity were admired traits.            Slaves often were used as grain grinders, ploughmen, sowers,  haywards, woodwards, shepherds, goatherds, swineherds, oxherds,  cowherds, dairymaids, and barnmen. Slaves had no legal rights. A lord  could kill his slave at will. A wrong done to a slave was regarded as  done to his owner. If a person killed another man's slave, he had to  compensate him with the slave's purchase price. The slave owner had to  answer for the offenses of his slaves against others, as for the  mischief done by his cattle. Since a slave had no property, he could  not be fined for crimes, but was whipped, mutilated, or killed.            During famine, acorns, beans, peas, and even bark were ground  down to supplement flour when grain stocks grew low. People scoured the  hedgerows for herbs, roots, nettles, and wild grasses, which were  usually left for the pigs. Sometimes people were driven to infanticide  or group suicide by jumping together off a cliff or into the water.            Several large kingdoms came to replace the many small ones. The  people were worshipping pagan gods when St. Augustine came to England  in 596 A.D. to Christianize them. King AEthelbert of Kent and his wife,  who had been raised Christian on the continent, met him when he  arrived. The King gave him land where there were ruins of an old city.  Augustine used stones from the ruins to build a church which was later  called Canterbury. He also built the first St. Paul's church in London.  Aethelbert and his men who fought with him and ate and lived in his  household [gesiths] became Christian. A succession of princesses went  out from Kent to marry other Saxon kings and convert them to  Christianity.            Augustine knew how to write, but King AEthelbert did not. The  King announced his laws at meetings of his people and his eorls would  decide the punishments. There was a fine of 120s. for disregarding a  command of the King. He and Augustine decided to write down some of  these laws, which now included the King's new law concerning the church.            These laws concern personal injury, killing, theft, burglary,  marriage, adultery, and inheritance. The blood feud's private revenge  for killing had been replaced by payment of compensation to the dead  man's kindred. One, or one's blood kindred, paid a man's \"wergeld\"  [worth] to his blood kindred for causing his wrongful death. The  wergeld [wer] of a king was an unpayable amount of about 7000s., of an  aetheling [a king-worthy man of the extended royal family] was 1500s.,  of an eorl, 300s., of a ceorl, 100s., of a laet [agricultural worker in  Kent, which class was between free and slave], 40-80s., and of a slave  nothing. At this time a shilling could buy a cow in Kent or a sheep  elsewhere. If a ceorl killed an eorl, he paid three times as much as an  eorl would have paid as murderer. Personal injury was compensated by a  \"bot\". The penalty for slander was tearing out of the tongue. If an  aetheling was guilty of this offense, his tongue was worth five times  that of a coerl, so he had to pay proportionately more to ransom it.  The crimes of murder, treachery to one's own lord, arson [burning a  house], house breaking, and open theft, were punishable by death and  forfeiture of all property.                         The Law            \"THESE ARE THE DOOMS [DECREES] WHICH KING AETHELBERHT  ESTABLISHED IN THE DAYS OF AUGUSTINE     1. [Theft of] the property of God and of the church [shall be  compensated], twelve fold; a bishop's property, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4081"],[0,"The Alchemist (#3)"],[1,"is clear ridicule in the character Antonio  Balladino of Anthony Munday, pageant-poet of the city, translator  of romances and playwright as well.  In \"Every Man in His Humour\"  there is certainly a caricature of Samuel Daniel, accepted poet of  the court, sonneteer, and companion of men of fashion.  These men  held recognised positions to which Jonson felt his talents better  entitled him; they were hence to him his natural enemies.  It seems  almost certain that he pursued both in the personages of his satire  through \"Every Man Out of His Humour,\" and \"Cynthia's Revels,\"  Daniel under the characters Fastidious Brisk and Hedon, Munday as  Puntarvolo and Amorphus; but in these last we venture on quagmire  once more.  Jonson's literary rivalry of Daniel is traceable again  and again, in the entertainments that welcomed King James on his  way to London, in the masques at court, and in the pastoral drama.  As to Jonson's personal ambitions with respect to these two men, it  is notable that he became, not pageant-poet, but chronologer to the  City of London; and that, on the accession of the new king, he came  soon to triumph over Daniel as the accepted entertainer of royalty.    \"Cynthia's Revels,\" the second \"comical satire,\" was acted in 1600,  and, as a play, is even more lengthy, elaborate, and impossible  than \"Every Man Out of His Humour.\"  Here personal satire seems to  have absorbed everything, and while much of the caricature is  admirable, especially in the detail of witty and trenchantly  satirical dialogue, the central idea of a fountain of self-love is  not very well carried out, and the persons revert at times to  abstractions, the action to allegory.  It adds to our wonder that  this difficult drama should have been acted by the Children of  Queen Elizabeth's Chapel, among them Nathaniel Field with whom  Jonson read Horace and Martial, and whom he taught later how to  make plays.  Another of these precocious little actors was  Salathiel Pavy, who died before he was thirteen, already famed for  taking the parts of old men.  Him Jonson immortalised in one of the  sweetest of his epitaphs.  An interesting sidelight is this on the  character of this redoubtable and rugged satirist, that he should  thus have befriended and tenderly remembered these little  theatrical waifs, some of whom (as we know) had been literally  kidnapped to be pressed into the service of the theatre and whipped  to the conning of their difficult parts.  To the caricature of  Daniel and Munday in \"Cynthia's Revels\" must be added Anaides  (impudence), here assuredly Marston, and Asotus (the prodigal),  interpreted as Lodge or, more perilously, Raleigh.  Crites, like  Asper-Macilente in \"Every Man Out of His Humour,\" is Jonson's  self-complaisant portrait of himself, the just, wholly admirable,  and judicious scholar, holding his head high above the pack of the  yelping curs of envy and detraction, but careless of their puny  attacks on his perfections with only too mindful a neglect.    The third and last of the \"comical satires\" is \"Poetaster,\" acted,  once more, by the Children of the Chapel in 1601, and Jonson's only  avowed contribution to the fray.  According to the author's own  account, this play was written in fifteen weeks on a report  that his enemies had entrusted to Dekker the preparation of  \"Satiromastix, the Untrussing of the Humorous Poet,\" a dramatic  attack upon himself.  In this attempt to forestall his enemies  Jonson succeeded, and \"Poetaster\" was an immediate and deserved  success.  While hardly more closely knit in structure than its  earlier companion pieces, \"Poetaster\" is planned to lead up to the  ludicrous final scene in which, after a device borrowed from the  \"Lexiphanes\" of Lucian, the offending poetaster, Marston-Crispinus,  is made to throw up the difficult words with which he had  overburdened his stomach as well as overlarded his vocabulary.  In  the end Crispinus with his fellow, Dekker-Demetrius, is bound over  to keep the peace and never thenceforward \"malign, traduce, or  detract the person or writings of Quintus Horatius Flaccus [Jonson]  or any other eminent man transcending you in merit.\"  One of the  most diverting personages in Jonson's comedy is Captain Tucca.  \"His peculiarity\" has been well described by Ward as \"a buoyant  blackguardism which recovers itself instantaneously from the most  complete exposure, and a picturesqueness of speech like that of a  walking dictionary of slang.\"    It was this character, Captain Tucca, that Dekker hit upon in his  reply, \"Satiromastix,\" and he amplified him, turning his abusive  vocabulary back upon Jonson and adding \"an immodesty to his  dialogue that did not enter into Jonson's conception.\"  It has been  held, altogether plausibly, that when Dekker was engaged  professionally, so to speak, to write a dramatic reply to Jonson,  he was at work on a species of chronicle history, dealing with the  story of Walter Terill in the reign of William Rufus.  This he  hurriedly adapted to include the satirical characters suggested by  \"Poetaster,\" and fashioned to convey the satire of his reply.  The  absurdity of placing Horace in the court of a Norman king is the  result. But Dekker's play is not without its palpable hits at the  arrogance, the literary pride, and self-righteousness of  Jonson-Horace, whose \"ningle\" or pal, the absurd Asinius Bubo, has  recently been shown to figure forth, in all likelihood, Jonson's  friend, the poet Drayton.  Slight and hastily adapted as is  \"Satiromastix,\" especially in a comparison with the better wrought  and more significant satire of \"Poetaster,\" the town awarded the  palm to Dekker, not to Jonson; and Jonson gave over in consequence  his practice of \"comical satire.\"  Though Jonson was cited to  appear before the Lord Chief Justice to answer certain charges to  the effect that he had attacked lawyers and soldiers in  \"Poetaster,\" nothing came of this complaint.  It may be suspected  that much of this furious clatter and give-and-take was pure  playing to the gallery.  The town was agog with the strife, and on  no less an authority than Shakespeare (\"Hamlet,\" ii. 2), we learn  that the children's company (acting the plays of Jonson) did \"so  berattle the common stages...that many, wearing rapiers, are afraid  of goose-quills, and dare scarce come thither.\"    Several other plays have been thought to bear a greater or less  part in the war of the theatres.  Among them the most important is  a college play, entitled \"The Return from Parnassus,\" dating  1601-02.  In it a much-quoted passage makes Burbage, as a  character, declare: \"Why here's our fellow Shakespeare puts them  all down; aye and Ben Jonson, too.  O that Ben Jonson is a  pestilent fellow; he brought up Horace, giving the poets a pill,  but our fellow Shakespeare hath given him a purge that made him  bewray his credit.\"  Was Shakespeare then concerned in this war of  the stages?  And what could have been the nature of this \"purge\"?  Among several suggestions, \"Troilus and Cressida\" has been thought  by some to be the play in which Shakespeare thus \"put down\" his  friend, Jonson.  A wiser interpretation finds the \"purge\" in  \"Satiromastix,\" which, though not written by Shakespeare, was  staged by his company, and therefore with his approval and under  his direction as one of the leaders of that company.    The last years of the reign of Elizabeth thus saw Jonson recognised  as a dramatist second only to Shakespeare, and not second even to  him as a dramatic satirist.  But Jonson now turned his talents to  new fields.  Plays on subjects derived from classical story and  myth had held the stage from the beginning of the drama, so that  Shakespeare was making no new departure when he wrote his \"Julius  Caesar\" about 1600.  Therefore when Jonson staged \"Sejanus,\" three  years later and with Shakespeare's company once more, he was only  following in the elder dramatist's footsteps.  But Jonson's idea of  a play on classical history, on the one hand, and Shakespeare's and  the elder popular dramatists, on the other, were very different.  Heywood some years before had put five straggling plays on the  stage in quick succession, all derived from stories in Ovid and  dramatised with little taste or discrimination.  Shakespeare had a  finer conception of form, but even he was contented to take all his  ancient history from North's translation of Plutarch and dramatise  his subject without further inquiry. Jonson was a scholar and a  classical antiquarian.  He reprobated this slipshod amateurishness,  and wrote his \"Sejanus\" like a scholar, reading Tacitus, Suetonius,  and other authorities, to be certain of his facts, his setting, and  his atmosphere, and somewhat pedantically noting his authorities in  the margin when he came to print.  \"Sejanus\" is a tragedy of  genuine dramatic power in which is told with discriminating taste  the story of the haughty favourite of Tiberius with his tragical  overthrow.  Our drama presents no truer nor more painstaking  representation of ancient Roman life than may be found in Jonson's  \"Sejanus\" and \"Catiline his Conspiracy,\" which followed in 1611.  A  passage in the address of the former play to the reader, in which  Jonson refers to a collaboration in an earlier version, has led to  the surmise that Shakespeare may have been that \"worthier pen.\"  There is no evidence to determine the matter.    In 1605, we find Jonson in active collaboration with Chapman  and Marston in the admirable comedy of London life entitled  \"Eastward Hoe.\"  In the previous year, Marston had dedicated his  \"Malcontent,\" in terms of fervid admiration, to Jonson; so that the  wounds of the war of the theatres must have been long since healed.  Between Jonson and Chapman there was the kinship of similar  scholarly ideals.  The two continued friends throughout life.  \"Eastward Hoe\" achieved the extraordinary popularity represented in  a demand for "]]]
