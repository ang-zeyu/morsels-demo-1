A  moment later it was transformed into a suit of glittering armor that  seemed fashioned of pure silver inlaid with gold, while the sheet of  bark at the same time became a handsome shield, with the figures of  three girls graven upon it.  Seseley recognized the features as those  of herself and her comrades, and noted also that they appeared sitting  at the edge of a forest, the great trees showing plainly in the  background.    \"I shall be your champion, you see,\" laughed the fairy, gleefully, \"and  maybe I shall be able to repay you for the loss of your cloak.\"    \"I do not mind the cloak,\" returned the child, who had been greatly  interested in these strange transformations.  \"But it seems impossible  that a dainty little girl like you can ride this horse and carry these  heavy arms.\"    \"I'll not be a girl much longer,\" said the little creature.  \"Here,  take my wand, and transform me into a noble youth!\"    Again the pretty fairy kneeled before Seseley, her dainty, rounded  limbs of white and rose showing plainly through her gauzy attire.  And  the baron's daughter was suddenly inspired to be brave, not wishing to  disappoint the venturous immortal.  So she rose and took the magic wand  in her hand, waving it three times above the head of the fairy.    \"By my powers as a mortal,\" she said, marveling even then at the  strange speech, \"I command you to become a brave and gallant  youth--handsome, strong, fearless!  And such shall you remain for the  space of one year.\"    As she ceased speaking the fairy was gone, and a slender youth,  dark-eyed and laughing, was holding her hand in his and kissing it  gratefully.    \"I thank you, most lovely maiden,\" he said, in a pleasant voice, \"for  giving me a place in the world of mortals.  I shall ride at once in  search of adventure, but my good sword is ever at your service.\"    With this he gracefully arose and began to buckle on his magnificent  armor and to fasten the sword to his belt.    Seseley drew a long, sighing breath of amazement at her own powers, and  turning to Berna and Helda she asked:    \"Do I see aright?  Is the little fairy really transformed to this  youth?\"    \"It certainly seems so,\" returned Helda, who, being unabashed by the  marvels she had beheld, turned to gaze boldly upon the young knight.    \"Do you still remember that a moment ago you were a fairy?\" she  inquired.    \"Yes, indeed,\" said he, smiling; \"and I am really a fairy now, being  but changed in outward form.  But no one must know this save  yourselves, until the year has expired and I resume my true station.  Will you promise to guard my secret?\"    \"Oh, yes!\" they exclaimed, in chorus.  For they were delighted, as any  children might well be, at having so remarkable a secret to keep and  talk over among themselves.    \"I must ask one more favor,\" continued the youth: \"that you give me a  name; for in this island I believe all men bear names of some sort, to  distinguish them one from another.\"    \"True,\" said Seseley, thoughtfully.  \"What were you called as a fairy?\"    \"That does not matter in the least,\" he answered, hastily.  \"I must  have an entirely new name.\"    \"Suppose we call him the Silver Knight,\" suggested Berna, as she eyed  his glistening armor.    \"Oh, no!--that is no name at all!\" declared Helda.  \"We might better  call him Baron Strongarm.\"    \"I do not like that, either,\" said the Lady Seseley, \"for we do not  know whether his arm is strong or not.  But he has been transformed in  a most astonishing and bewildering manner before our very eyes, and I  think the name of Prince Marvel would suit him very well.\"    \"Excellent!\" cried the youth, picking up his richly graven shield.  \"The name seems fitting in every way.  And for a year I shall be known  to all this island as Prince Marvel!\"        5.  The King of Thieves    Old Marshelm, the captain of the guard, was much surprised when he saw  the baron's daughter and her playmates approach her father's castle  escorted by a knight in glittering armor.    To be sure it was a rather small knight, but the horse he led by the  bridle was so stately and magnificent in appearance that old Marshelm,  who was an excellent judge of horses, at once decided the stranger must  be a personage of unusual importance.    As they came nearer the captain of the guard also observed the beauty  of the little knight's armor, and caught the glint of jewels set in the  handle of his sword; so he called his men about him and prepared to  receive the knight with the honors doubtless due his high rank.    But to the captain's disappointment the stranger showed no intention of  entering the castle.  On the contrary, he kissed the little Lady  Seseley's hand respectfully, waved an adieu to the others, and then  mounted his charger and galloped away over the plains.    The drawbridge was let down to permit the three children to enter, and  the great Baron Merd came himself to question his daughter.    \"Who was the little knight?\" he asked.    \"His name is Prince Marvel,\" answered Seseley, demurely.    \"Prince Marvel?\" exclaimed the Baron.  \"I have never heard of him.  Does he come from the Kingdom of Dawna, or that of Auriel, or Plenta?\"    \"That I do not know,\" said Seseley, with truth.    \"Where did you meet him?\" continued the baron.    \"In the forest, my father, and he kindly escorted us home.\"    \"Hm!\" muttered the baron, thoughtfully.  \"Did he say what adventure  brought him to our Kingdom of Heg?\"    \"No, father.  But he mentioned being in search of adventure.\"    \"Oh, he'll find enough to busy him in this wild island, where every man  he meets would rather draw his sword than eat,\" returned the old  warrior, smiling.  \"How old may this Prince Marvel be?\"    \"He looks not over fifteen years of age,\" said Seseley, uneasy at so  much questioning, for she did not wish to be forced to tell an untruth.  \"But it is possible he is much older,\" she added, beginning to get  confused.    \"Well, well; I am sorry he did not pay my castle a visit,\" declared the  baron.  \"He is very small and slight to be traveling this dangerous  country alone, and I might have advised him as to his welfare.\"    Seseley thought that Prince Marvel would need no advice from any one as  to his conduct; but she wisely refrained from speaking this thought,  and the old baron walked away to glance through a slit in the stone  wall at the figure of the now distant knight.    Prince Marvel was riding swiftly toward the brow of the hill, and  shortly his great war-horse mounted the ascent and disappeared on its  farther slope.    The youth's heart was merry and light, and he reflected joyously, as he  rode along, that a whole year of freedom and fascinating adventure lay  before him.    The valley in which he now found himself was very beautiful, the soft  grass beneath his horse's feet being sprinkled with bright flowers,  while clumps of trees stood here and there to break the monotony of the  landscape.    For an hour the prince rode along, rejoicing in the free motion of his  horse and breathing in the perfume-laden air.  Then he found he had  crossed the valley and was approaching a series of hills.  These were  broken by huge rocks, the ground being cluttered with boulders of rough  stone.  His horse speedily found a pathway leading through these rocks,  but was obliged to proceed at a walk, turning first one way and then  another as the path zigzagged up the hill.    Presently, being engaged in deep thought and little noting the way,  Prince Marvel rode between two high walls of rock standing so close  together that horse and rider could scarcely pass between the sides.  Having traversed this narrow space some distance the wall opened  suddenly upon a level plat of ground, where grass and trees grew.  It  was not a very big place, but was surely the end of the path, as all  around it stood bare walls so high and steep that neither horse nor man  could climb them.  In the side of the rocky wall facing the entrance  the traveler noticed a hollow, like the mouth of a cave, across which  was placed an iron gate.  And above the gateway was painted in red  letters on the gray stone the following words:                  WUL-TAKIM           KING OF THIEVES                ------          HIS TREASURE HOUSE               KEEP OUT      Prince Marvel laughed on reading this, and after getting down from his  saddle he advanced to the iron gate and peered through its heavy bars.    \"I have no idea who this Wul-Takim is,\" he said, \"for I know nothing at  all of the ways of men outside the forest in which I have always dwelt.  But thieves are bad people, I am quite sure, and since Wul-Takim is the  king of thieves he must be by far the worst man on this island.\"    Then he saw, through the bars of the gate, that a great cavern lay  beyond, in which were stacked treasures of all sorts: rich cloths,  golden dishes and ornaments, gemmed coronets and bracelets, cleverly  forged armor, shields and battle-axes.  Also there were casks and bales  of merchandise of every sort.    The gate appeared to have no lock, so Prince Marvel opened it and  walked in.  Then he perceived, perched on the very top of a pyramid of  casks, the form of a boy, who sat very still and watched him with a  look of astonishment upon his face.    \"What are you doing up there?\" asked the prince.    \"Nothing,\" said the boy.  \"If I moved the least little bit this pile of  casks would topple over, and I should be thrown to the ground.\"    \"Well,\" returned the prince, \"what of it?\"    But just then he glanced at the ground and saw why the boy did not care  to tumble down.  For in the earth were planted many swords, with their  sharp blades pointing upward, and to fall upon these meant serious  wounds and perhaps death.    \"Oh, ho!\" cried Marvel; \"I begin to understand.  You are a prisoner.\"    \"Yes; as you will also be shortly,\" answered the boy.  \"And then you  will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5180"],[0,"Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) Ruling (#3)"],[1,"cene, child pornography, or in the case of  minors, harmful to minors.  Unfortunately this outcome, devoutly  to be wished, is not available in this less than best of all  possible worlds.  No category definition used by the blocking  programs is identical to the legal definitions of obscenity,  child pornography, or material harmful to minors, and, at all  events, filtering programs fail to block access to a substantial  amount of content on the Internet that falls into the categories  defined by CIPA.  As will appear, we credit the testimony of  plaintiffs' expert Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg that the blocking  software is (at least for the foreseeable future) incapable of  effectively blocking the majority of materials in the categories  defined by CIPA without overblocking a substantial amount of  materials.  Nunberg's analysis was supported by extensive record  evidence.  As noted above, this inability to prevent both  substantial amounts of underblocking and overblocking stems from  several sources, including limitations on the technology that  software filtering companies use to gather and review Web pages,  limitations on resources for human review of Web pages, and the  necessary error that results from human review processes.      Because the filtering software mandated by CIPA will block  access to substantial amounts of constitutionally protected  speech whose suppression serves no legitimate government  interest, we are persuaded that a public library's use of  software filters is not narrowly tailored to further any of these  interests.  Moreover, less restrictive alternatives exist that  further the government's legitimate interest in preventing the  dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, and material  harmful to minors, and in preventing patrons from being  unwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicit  content.  To prevent patrons from accessing visual depictions  that are obscene and child pornography, public libraries may  enforce Internet use policies that make clear to patrons that the  library's Internet terminals may not be used to access illegal  speech.  Libraries may then impose penalties on patrons who  violate these policies, ranging from a warning to notification of  law enforcement, in the appropriate case.  Less restrictive  alternatives to filtering that further libraries' interest in  preventing minors from exposure to visual depictions that are  harmful to minors include requiring parental consent to or  presence during unfiltered access, or restricting minors'  unfiltered access to terminals within view of library staff.  Finally, optional filtering, privacy screens, recessed monitors,  and placement of unfiltered Internet terminals outside of sight-  lines provide less restrictive alternatives for libraries to  prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexually  explicit content on the Internet.  In an effort to avoid the potentially fatal legal  implications of the overblocking problem, the government falls  back on the ability of the libraries, under CIPA's disabling  provisions, see CIPA Sec. 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. Sec. 9134(f)(3)),  CIPA Sec.1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. Sec. 254(h)(6)(D)), to unblock  a site that is patently proper yet improperly blocked.  The  evidence reflects that libraries can and do unblock the filters  when a patron so requests.  But it also reflects that requiring  library patrons to ask for a Web site to be unblocked will deter  many patrons because they are embarrassed, or desire to protect  their privacy or remain anonymous.  Moreover, the unblocking may  take days, and may be unavailable, especially in branch  libraries, which are often less well staffed than main libraries.   Accordingly, CIPA's disabling provisions do not cure the  constitutional deficiencies in public libraries' use of Internet  filters.      Under these circumstances we are constrained to conclude  that the library plaintiffs must prevail in their contention that  CIPA requires them to violate the First Amendment rights of their  patrons, and accordingly is facially invalid, even under the  standard urged on us by the government, which would permit us to  facially invalidate CIPA only if it is impossible for a single  public library to comply with CIPA's conditions without violating  the First Amendment.  In view of the limitations inherent in the  filtering technology mandated by CIPA, any public library that  adheres to CIPA's conditions will necessarily restrict patrons'  access to a substantial amount of protected speech, in violation  of the First Amendment.  Given this conclusion, we need not reach  plaintiffs' arguments that CIPA effects a prior restraint on  speech and is unconstitutionally vague.  Nor do we decide their  cognate unconstitutional conditions theory, though for reasons  explained infra at note 36, we discuss the issues raised by that  claim at some length.  For these reasons, we will enter an Order declaring Sections  1712(a)(2) and 1721(b) of the Children's Internet Protection  Act, codified at 20 U.S.C. Sec. 9134(f) and 47 U.S.C. Sec.  254(h)(6), respectively, to be facially invalid under the  First Amendment and permanently enjoining the defendants  from enforcing those provisions.II.    Findings of Fact  1.        Statutory Framework  1.        Nature and Operation of the E-rate and LSTA  Programs  In the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (\"1996 Act\"), Congress  directed the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") to take  the steps necessary to establish a system of support mechanisms  to ensure the delivery of affordable telecommunications service  to all Americans.  This system, referred to as \"universal  service,\" is codified in section 254 of the Communications Act of  1934, as amended by the 1996 Act.  See 47 U.S.C. Sec. 254.  Congress  specified several groups as beneficiaries of the universal  service support mechanism, including consumers in high-cost  areas, low-income consumers, schools and libraries, and rural  health care providers.  See 47 U.S.C. Sec. 254(h)(1).  The extension  of universal service to schools and libraries in section 254(h)  is commonly referred to as the Schools and Libraries Program, or  \"E-rate\" Program.      Under the E-rate Program, \"[a]ll telecommunications carriers  serving a geographic area shall, upon a bona fide request for any  of its services that are within the definition of universal  service . . ., provide such services to elementary schools,  secondary schools, and libraries for educational purposes at  rates less than the amounts charged for similar services to other  parties.\"  47 U.S.C. Sec. 254(h)(1)(B).  Under FCC regulations,  providers of \"interstate telecommunications\" (with certain  exceptions, see 47 C.F.R. Sec. 54.706(d)), must contribute a portion  of their revenue for disbursement among eligible carriers that  are providing services to those groups or areas specified by  Congress in section 254.  To be eligible for the discounts, a  library must: (1) be eligible for assistance from a State library  administrative agency under the Library Services and Technology  Act, see infra; (2) be funded as an independent entity,  completely separate from any schools; and (3) not be operating as  a for-profit business.  See 47 C.F.R. Sec. 54.501(c).  Discounts on  services for eligible libraries are set as a percentage of the  pre-discount price, and range from 20% to 90%, depending on a  library's level of economic disadvantage and its location in an  urban or rural area.  See 47 C.F.R. Sec. 54.505.  Currently, a  library's level of economic disadvantage is based on the  percentage of students eligible for the national school lunch  program in the school district in which the library is located.      The Library Services and Technology Act (\"LSTA\"), Subchapter  II of the Museum and Library Services Act, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 9101 et  seq., was enacted by Congress in 1996 as part of the Omnibus  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 104-208.  The LSTA establishes three grant programs to achieve the goal of  improving library services across the nation.  Under the Grants  to States Program, LSTA grant funds are awarded, inter alia, in  order to assist libraries in accessing information through  electronic networks and pay for the costs of acquiring or sharing  computer systems and telecommunications technologies.  See 20  U.S.C. Sec. 9141(a).  Through the Grants to States program, LSTA  funds have been used to acquire and pay costs associated with  Internet-accessible computers located in libraries.  2.        CIPA  The Children's Internet Protection Act (\"CIPA\") was enacted  as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001, which  consolidated and enacted several appropriations bills, including  the Miscellaneous Appropriations Act, of which CIPA was a part.  See Pub. L. No. 106-554.  CIPA addresses three distinct types of  federal funding programs: (1) aid to elementary and secondary  schools pursuant to Title III of the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act of 1965, see CIPA Sec. 1711 (amending Title 20 to add  Sec. 3601); (2) LSTA grants to states for support of libraries, see  CIPA Sec. 1712 (amending the Museum and Library Services Act, 20  U.S.C. Sec. 9134); and (3) discounts under the E-rate program, see  CIPA Sec. 1721(a) & (b) (both amending the Communications Act of  1934, 47 U.S.C. Sec. 254(h)).  Only sections 1712 and 1721(b) of  CIPA, which apply to libraries, are at issue in this case.      As explained in more detail below, CIPA requires libraries  that participate in the LSTA and E-rate programs to certify that  they are using software filters on their computers to protect  against visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or  in the case of minors, harmful to minors.  CIPA permits library  officials to disable the filters for patrons for bona fide  research or other lawful purposes, but disabling is not permitted  for minor"]]]
