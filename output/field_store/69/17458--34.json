CHAPTER IV    A LONG RIDE    The train was speeding along with that regular motion that puts many  travelers to sleep, when Freddie curled himself on the sofa and went to  sleep.    \"Poor little chap!\" Mr. Bobbsey remarked. \"He is tired out, and he was  so worried about Snoop!\"    \"I'm glad we were able to get this sofa, so many other people like a  rest and there are only four sofas on each car,\" Mrs. Bobbsey explained  to Dinah, who was now tucking Freddie in as if he were at home in his  own cozy bed. The air cushion was blown up, and put under the yellow  head and a shawl was carefully placed over him.    Flossie's pretty dimpled face was pressed close to the window pane,  admiring the big world that seemed to be running away from the train,  and Bert found the observation end of the train very interesting.    \"What a beautiful grove of white birch trees!\" Nan exclaimed, as the  train swung into a ravine. \"And see the soft ferns clinging about them.  Mother, the ferns around the birch tree make me think of the fine lace  about your throat!\"    \"Why, daughter, you seem to be quite poetical!\" and the mother smiled,  for indeed Nan had a very promising mind.    \"What time will we get there, papa?\" Bert asked, returning from the  vestibule.    \"In time for dinner Aunt Sarah said, that is if they keep dinner for us  until one o'clock,\" answered the parent, as he consulted his watch.    \"It seems as if we had been on the train all night,\" Flossie remarked.    \"Well, we started early, dear,\" the mother assured the tired little  girl. \"Perhaps you would like one of Dinah's dainty sandwiches now?\"    A light lunch was quickly decided on, and Dinah took Flossie and Nan to  a little private room at one end of the train, Bert went with his  father to the smoking room on the other end, while the mother remained  to watch Freddie. The lunch was put up so that each small sandwich  could be eaten without a crumb spilling, as the little squares were  each wrapped separately in waxed paper.    There was a queer alcohol lamp in the ladies room, and other handy  contrivances for travelers, which amused Flossie and Nan.    \"Dat's to heat milk fo' babies,\" Dinah told the girls, as she put the  paper napkins carefully on their laps, and got each a nice drink of  icewater out of the cooler.    Meanwhile Bert was enjoying his lunch at the other end of the car, for  children always get hungry when traveling, and meals on the train are  only served at certain hours. Two other little girls came into the  compartment while Flossie and Nan were at lunch. The strange girls wore  gingham aprons over their fine white dresses, to keep the car dust off  their clothes, and they had paper caps on their heads like the favors  worn at children's parties. Seeing there was no stool vacant the  strangers darted out again in rather a rude way, Nan thought.    \"Take you time, honeys,\" Dinah told her charges. \"If dey is very hungry  dey can get ice cream outside.\"    \"But mother never lets us eat strange ice cream,\" Flossie reminded the  maid. \"And maybe they can't either.\"    Soon the lunch was finished, and the Bobbseys felt much refreshed by  it. Freddie still slept with Snoop's box close beside him, and Mrs.  Bobbsey was reading a magazine.    \"One hour more!\" Bert announced, beginning to pick things up even that  early.    \"Now we better all close our eyes and rest, so that we will feel good  when we get to Meadow Brook,\" Mrs. Bobbsey told them. It was no task to  obey this suggestion, and the next thing the children knew, mother and  father and Dinah were waking them up to get them ready to leave the  train.    \"Now, don't forget anything,\" Mr. Bobbsey cautioned the party, as hats  and wraps were donned and parcels picked up.    Freddie was still very sleepy and his papa had to carry him off, while  the others, with some excitement, hurried after.    \"Oh, Snoop, Snoop!\" cried Freddie as, having reached the platform, they  now saw the train start off. \"I forgot Snoop! Get him quick!\"    \"Dat kitten again!\" Dinah exclaimed, with some indignation. \"He's more  trouble den--den de whole family!\"    In an instant the train had gotten up speed, and it seemed Snoop was  gone this time sure.    \"Snoop!\" cried Freddie, in dismay.    Just then the kind porter who had befriended the cat before, appeared  on the platform with the perforated box in his hand.    \"I wanted to keep him,\" stammered the porter, \"but I knows de little  boy 'ud break his heart after him.\" And he threw the box to Mr. Bobbsey.    There was no time for words, but Mr. Bobbsey thrust a coin in the man's  hand and all the members of the Bobbsey family looked their thanks.    \"Well, I declare, you can't see anybody,\" called out a good-natured  little lady, trying to surround them all at once.    \"Aunt Sarah!\" exclaimed the Bobbseys.    \"And Uncle Dan!\"    \"And Harry!\"    \"Hello! How do? How are you? How be you?\" and such kissing and  handshaking had not for some time entertained the old agent at the  Meadow Brook station.    \"Here at last!\" Uncle Daniel declared, grabbing up Freddie and giving  him the kind of hug Freddie had intended giving Aunt Sarah.    The big wagon from the Bobbsey farm, with the seats running along each  side, stood at the other side of the platform, and into this the  Bobbseys were gathered, bag and baggage, not forgetting the little  black cat.    \"All aboard for Meadow Brook farm!\" called Bert, as the wagon started  off along the shady country road.        CHAPTER V    MEADOW BROOK    \"Oh, how cool the trees are out here!\" Flossie exclaimed, as the wagon  rumbled along so close to the low trees that Bert could reach out and  pick horse-chestnut blossoms.    \"My, how sweet it is!\" said Dinah, as she sniffed audibly, enjoying the  freshness of the country.    Freddie was on the seat with Uncle Dan and had Snoop's box safe in his  arms. He wanted to let the cat see along the road, but everybody  protested.    \"No more Snoop in this trip,\" laughed Mr. Bobbsey. \"He has had all the  fun he needs for to-day.\" So Freddie had to be content.    \"Oh, do let me get out?\" pleaded Nan presently. \"See that field of  orange lilies.\"    \"Not now, dear,\" Aunt Sarah told her. \"Dinner is spoiling for us, and  we can often walk down here to get flowers.\"    \"Oh, the cute little calf! Look!\" Bert exclaimed from his seat next to  Harry, who had been telling his cousin of all the plans he had made for  a jolly vacation.    \"Look at the billy-goat!\" called Freddie.    \"See, see, that big black chicken flying!\" Flossie cried out excitedly.    \"That's a hawk!\" laughed Bert; \"maybe it's a chicken hawk.\"    \"A children hawk!\" Flossie exclaimed, missing the word. Then everybody  laughed, and Flossie said maybe there were children hawks for bad girls  and boys, anyway.    Aunt Sarah and Mrs. Bobbsey were chatting away like two schoolgirls,  while Dinah and the children saw something new and interesting at every  few paces old Billy, the horse, took.    \"Hello there, neighbor,\" called a voice from the field at the side of  the road. \"My horse has fallen in the ditch, and I'll have to trouble  you to help me.\"    \"Certainly, certainly, Peter,\" answered Uncle Daniel, promptly jumping  down, with Mr. Bobbsey, Bert, and Harry following. Aunt Sarah leaned  over the seat and took the reins, but when she saw in what ditch the  other horse had fallen she pulled Billy into the gutter.    \"Poor Peter!\" she exclaimed. \"That's the second horse that fell in that  ditch this week. And it's an awful job to get them out. I'll just wait  to see if they need our Billy, and if not, we can drive on home, for  Martha will be most crazy waiting with dinner.\"    Uncle Daniel, Mr. Bobbsey, and the boys hurried to where Peter Burns  stood at the brink of one of those ditches that look like mud and turn  out to be water.    \"And that horse is a boarder too!\" Peter told them. \"Last night we said  he looked awful sad, but we didn't think he would commit suicide.\"    \"Got plenty of blankets?\" Uncle Daniel asked, pulling his coat off and  preparing to help his neighbor, as all good people do in the country.    \"Four of them, and these planks. But I couldn't get a man around. Lucky  you happened by,\" Peter Burns answered.    All this time the horse in the ditch moaned as if in pain, but Peter  said it was only because he couldn't get on his feet. Harry, being  light in weight, slipped a halter over the poor beast's head.    \"I could get a strap around him!\" Harry suggested, moving out  cautiously on the plank.    \"All right, my lad, go ahead,\" Peter told him, passing the big strap  over to Bert, who in turn passed it on to Harry.    It was no easy matter to get the strap in place, but with much tugging  and splashing of mud Harry succeeded. Then the ropes were attached and  everybody pulled vigorously.    \"Get up, Ginger! Get up, Ginger!\" Peter called lustily, but Ginger only  seemed to flop in deeper, through his efforts to raise himself.    \"Guess we'll have to get Billy to pull,\" Uncle Daniel suggested, and  Mr. Bobbsey hurried back to the road to unhitch the other horse.    \"Don't let Billy fall in!\" exclaimed Nan, who was much excited over the  accident.    \"Can't I go, papa?\" Freddie pleaded. \"I'll stay away from the edge!\"    \"You better stay in the wagon; the horse might cut up when he gets  out,\" the father warned Freddie, who reluctantly gave in.    Soon Billy was hitched to the ropes, and with a few kind words from  Uncle Daniel the big white horse strained forward, pulling Ginger to  his feet as he did so.    \"Hurrah!\" shouted Freddie from the wagon. \"Billy is a circus horse,  isn't he, Uncle Dan?\"    \"He's a good boy,\" the uncle called back patting Billy affectionately,  while Mr. Bobbsey and the boys loosened the straps. The other horse lay  on the blankets, and Peter "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7140"],[0,"The Great Conspiracy, Complete (#3)"],[1,"                               CHAPTER XI.
