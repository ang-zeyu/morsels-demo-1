You  doubtless do not know that he has threatened to cut my skirts short, in  order to disgrace me, if I allow my lady to hold any converse with you.  I beseech you to do nothing to increase his anger, as things have not  gone well with him to-day.\"    \"Fear nothing, honoured due[~n]a,\" replied Rodrigo, \"for if the count cuts  your skirts short I shall give you others made of the richest cloth.\"    \"I know well that you are a cavalier, and it is the prerogative of  cavaliers to be generous. Speak with my lady; but be brief. I shall  meantime keep watch, and say my beads that my lord may not see ye.\"    Rodrigo and Ximena were already conversing, not paying the slightest  attention to the words of Lambra.    \"Rodrigo,\" said Ximena, \"whither have gone those happy times when the  houses of De Vivar and De Gormaz were as one trunk with two branches;  when no cloud obscured the bright sky of our loves; when we saw the  distant horizon rosy and beautiful before us; when I found in your  parents the love which you found in mine? Vain have been your efforts,  vain have been mine, and vain also have been those of your friends and  mine, to appease the enmity which now separates our noble parents.\"    \"That time, Ximena, has not, perhaps, passed away never to return. My  father, the son of Lain Calvo, although old, preserves, in youthful  luxuriance, the noble pride of ancestry, and it would not correspond  with such dignity if he were to bear with patience the unjust suspicions  with which your father has responded to his friendship. For a long time  he has borne them, Ximena. I indeed might humiliate myself before your  father, without such humiliation casting a stain on me, for I would do  it for your sake, and no reproach could be directed against him who  humiliates himself for a lady. What does your father desire? Honours;  riches; a kingdom; a throne for his daughter? You shall have all that,  Ximena, I swear it by our love and by the honour of my ancestors. My arm  is strong and my heart full of courage. Even to-morrow I shall set out  for the country of our enemies. I shall enter the territory of the  Moors, I shall fight as Bernardo fought at Roncesvalles, and I shall be  victorious; for that love, which I have cherished for you during so many  years, will make me invincible; and I shall lay all at the feet of your  father, demanding, as a recompense, your hand and the return of the  friendship which, at one time, was equal to ours for him.\"    \"Good heavens!\" said Do[~n]a Lambra, \"my lord is just coming, and you, Don  Rodrigo, will be the victim of his anger; and if he cuts my skirts  short, good-bye to those of rich cloth!\"    The two lovers paid little attention to the inquietude and the  ridiculous words of the due[~n]a.    \"I know well, Ximena,\" continued Rodrigo, \"that your father will use  every means in order to avenge his supposed injuries on mine, and  perchance I, the idol of Diego Lainez, shall be the first victim of his  attempts; for, in order to wound the heart of the father, he will wound  that of the son, by taking from me the hope of gaining the sole object  of my ambition, which is yourself, Ximena. However, if the love which  you often have sworn to me is real, if you hold in any account the  happiness, the hopes, the life of the companion of your childhood, of  him who has dreamed of such felicity with you, you will know how to  resist his endeavours until the day shall come when Rodrigo will return  to Castile, worthy of the daughter of a king. Then pride will compel him  to grant that which his ambition, thwarted in its hopes, now denies to  me.\"    \"I swear to you,\" answered Ximena, in one of those bursts of enthusiasm  in which, without taking reason into account, all things appear possible  to us,--\"I swear to you that nothing in this world shall be able to  conquer my resolve,--I shall be the wife of Rodrigo or of none other. My  father may be able to extinguish the breath of my lungs, but never the  love of my heart.\"    \"Ah!\" exclaimed Rodrigo, \"blessed was the day when my eyes first looked  on you! Perhaps, without the love of Ximena, Rodrigo Diaz would be one  of those plants which spring up, live, and die, without having borne any  fruit; one of those men who pass through the world without leaving a  trace which might point out his path to those who come after him; your  love, however, will immortalise his name; by him the plains of Castile  will be stained by Moslim blood; through him the standard of Mahomet  will be trampled under foot by the Christian kingdoms; in him the weak  and the oppressed shall have an arm to sustain and defend them; and  through him the race of the Counts of Castile shall wear the royal  purple.\"    Whilst thus speaking, forgetting where he was, the cheeks of Rodrigo  flushed, his broad and noble brow lit up, and his eyes sparkled, as if  all the fire that inflamed his heart flew to his head. The eyes of  Ximena shone also with joy, and her heart beat with violence, agitated  by love and pride,--by pride, for the daughter of a king would have felt  it, knowing she was loved by such a generous and brave youth, to whom  she desired to return, in her ardent glances, all the treasures of love  which were shut up in her soul.    The anxiety of Lambra was increasing every moment, and not without  cause; for the crowd which had collected around the royal family,  curiosity being satisfied, was moving off and distributing itself  through the saloons; and the honoured due[~n]a feared the return of her  master, or that someone might notice her complacency and report it to  him.    \"Ah! my skirts!\" she said, moving in between Ximena and Rodrigo, \"my  master is coming, and he will cut them short without remedy!\"    A group of cavaliers came from the farthest end of the hall, and Rodrigo  thought he saw amongst them Don Gome.    \"Adieu, Ximena,\" the young man hastened to say; \"either everything or  nothing, either death or Ximena!\"    \"Either Rodrigo or nothing!\" replied the young girl, following with her  glances her lover, who was just issuing from the halls of the Alcazar at  the instant that the count was returning to the side of his daughter.    An unusual joyous expression could be noticed on the visage of Don Gome,  which but shortly before was gloomy, and frequently contracted by anger.  The cause of this was, that the Count de Gormaz, far from receiving, as  he feared, a fresh slight from the king, had met with a kind reception,  which, as he had not anticipated it, doubly pleased him. To what was due  this sudden change in the feelings of the monarch? It was caused by the  endeavours which Diego Lainez, taking advantage of the mood in which the  king was on that day to grant favours, had used, with the object of  restoring his former friend to the royal favour. The monarch ultimately  had yielded to his solicitations, promising to show marks of kindness to  the grandee De Gormaz, in the presence of the entire Court. And indeed  the king had done so; when Don Gome had approached him in the saloons of  the Alcazar. Don Fernando had succeeded in concealing his resentment,  and received him with the same kindness which he exhibited towards Diego  Lainez himself.    \"Ximena, my daughter!\" exclaimed the count, pressing her in his arms,  for he required some means of showing his content, \"the king, despite my  calumniators, has remembered my services, and restored me to his favour.  Don Fernando, who knows how much I love you,--that you are the dearest  thing that your father possesses, and that honouring you he honours  me,--desires to see you, and has commanded me to lead you to him.\"    Pleasure, in turn, shone on the countenance of Ximena; it was not,  however, the same kind of pleasure which her father experienced; it was  not that joy which proceeds from satisfied vanity. The reason for it  was, that Ximena loved her father, although she was well acquainted with  his defects, and desired his happiness, whatever might be the occasion  of it. A ray of hope now brightened up her heart--the hope that the old  friendly relations between the two families might be renewed, the  consequence of which would be the return of those happy times when no  obstacle was interposed between her and her lover. Pure and loving souls  are as much inclined towards hope as towards despair; Ximena, therefore,  ran over in her mind, in a brief space of time, those conflicting  sentiments, and passed from darkness to light, from death to life.    Her father then led her into the presence of the king, from whom, as  well as from the queen and the royal children, she received a most kind  reception. The many different experiences, which she had passed through  on that day, had in no way rendered her less beautiful than usual, and a  murmur of admiration arose amongst the ladies and cavaliers who were  accompanying the royal family when Ximena approached. De Gormaz smiled  with satisfaction and pride; and Diego Lainez, contemplating for the  thousandth time so much beauty and nobleness of expression, could not  help thinking, \"My Rodrigo will be a hero if she commands it; he will  gain a throne if she asks him for one!\" And a similar thought most  likely came into the minds of many others, for no one connected with the  Court was ignorant of the old love that united Ximena and Rodrigo, nor  of the influence that the maiden exercised on the soul of the valiant  youth who was the pride of the family of De Vivar, and the hope of the  good Castilians and Leonese.          CHAPTER II    IN WHICH CERTAIN FESTIVITIES ARE DESCRIBED, WHICH ENDED WITH A BLOW ON A  FACE      The numerous guests who occupied the saloons of the Alcazar were  devoting themselves, joyously and noisily, to the various amusements  which the magnificent festival provided; whilst the king and the royal  princes were familiarly conversing with the group of cavaliers that  surrounded them; and the queen "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42"],[0,"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (#3)"],[1,"that there sprang up and  grew apace in the lawyer's mind a singularly strong, almost an  inordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde.  If he could but once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would  lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as was the habit of  mysterious    16)    things when well examined. He might see a reason for his friend's  strange preference or bondage (call it which you please) and even  for the startling clause of the will. At least it would be a face  worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a  face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of the  unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred.    From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the  by-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when  business was plenty, and time scarce, at night under the face of the  fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or  concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.    \"If he be Mr. Hyde,\" he had thought, \"I shall be Mr. Seek.\"    And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night;  frost in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the  lamps, unshaken, by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light  and shadow. By ten o'clock, when the shops were closed, the  by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of  London from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far;  domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either  side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of any  passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been some  minutes at his post, when he was    17)    aware of an odd, light footstep drawing near. In the course of his  nightly patrols, he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect  with which the footfalls of a single person, while he is still a  great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and  clatter of the city. Yet his attention had never before been so  sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong,  superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry  of the court.    The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as  they turned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from  the entry, could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with.  He was small and very plainly dressed, and the look of him, even at  that distance, went somehow strongly against the watcher's  inclination. But he made straight for the door, crossing the  roadway to save time; and as he came, he drew a key from his pocket  like one approaching home.    Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he  passed. \"Mr. Hyde, I think?\"    Mr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his  fear was only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in  the face, he answered coolly enough: \"That is my name. What do you  want?\"    \"I see you are going in,\" returned the lawyer. \"I am an old friend  of Dr. Jekyll's--Mr. Utter-    18)    son of Gaunt Street--you must have heard my name; and meeting you  so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.\"    \"You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,\" replied Mr. Hyde,  blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,  \"How did you know me?\" he asked.    \"On your side,\" said Mr. Utterson, \"will you do me a favour?\"    \"With pleasure,\" replied the other. \"What shall it be?\"    \"Will you let me see your face?\" asked the lawyer.    Mr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden  reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair  stared at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. \"Now I shall  know you again,\" said Mr. Utterson. \"It may be useful.\"    \"Yes,\" returned Mr. Hyde, \"it is as well we have, met; and a  propos, you should have my address.\" And he gave a number of a  street in Soho.    \"Good God!\" thought Mr. Utterson, \"can he, too, have been thinking  of the will?\" But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted  in acknowledgment of the address.    \"And now,\" said the other, \"how did you know me?\"    \"By description,\" was the reply.    \"Whose description?\"    19)    \"We have common friends,\" said Mr. Utterson.    \"Common friends?\" echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. \"Who are  they?\"    \"Jekyll, for instance,\" said the lawyer.    \"He never told you,\" cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. \"I did  not think you would have lied.\"    \"Come,\" said Mr. Utterson, \"that is not fitting language.\"      The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment,  with extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and  disappeared into the house.    The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of  disquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing  every step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in  mental perplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked,  was one of a class that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and  dwarfish, he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable  malformation, he had a displeasing smile, he had borne himself to  the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and  boldness, and he spoke with a husky, whispering and somewhat broken  voice; all these were points against him, but not all of these  together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing, and  fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. \"There must be some-    20)    thing else,\" said the perplexed gentleman. \"There is something  more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man seems  hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be the  old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul  that thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent?  The last, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read  Satan's signature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.\"    Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,  handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high  estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of  men: map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers, and the agents of  obscure enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was  still occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great  air of wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness  except for the fan-light, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A  well-dressed, elderly servant opened the door.    \"Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?\" asked the lawyer.    \"I will see, Mr. Utterson,\" said Poole, admitting the visitor, as  he spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall, paved with  flags, warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright,  open fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. \"Will you  wait here by the    21)    fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining room?\"    \"Here, thank you,\" said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on  the tall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a  pet fancy of his friend the doctor's; and Utterson himself was wont  to speak of it as the pleasantest room in London. But to-night there  was a shudder in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his  memory; he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of  life; and in the gloom of his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in  the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the  uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his  relief, when Poole presently returned to announce that Dr. Jekyll  was gone out.    \"I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting-room door, Poole,\" he  said. \"Is that right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?\"    \"Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,\" replied the servant. \"Mr. Hyde  has a key.\"    \"Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young  man, Poole,\" resumed the other musingly.    \"Yes, sir, he do indeed,\" said Poole. \"We have all orders to obey  him.\"    \"I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?\" asked Utterson.      \"O, dear no, sir. He never dines here,\" replied the butler. \"Indeed  we see very little of    22)    him on this side of the house; he mostly comes and goes by the  laboratory.\"    \"Well, good-night, Poole.\"    \"Good-night, Mr. Utterson.\" And the lawyer set out homeward with a  very heavy heart. \"Poor Harry Jekyll,\" he thought, \"my mind  misgives me he is in deep waters! He was wild when he was young; a  long while ago to be sure; but in the law of God, there is no  statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost of some old  sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming, PEDE  CLAUDO, years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the  fault.\" And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded a while on  his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, lest by chance  some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light there.  His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of their  life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by the  many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and  fearful gratitude by the many that he had come so near to doing, yet  avoided. And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a  spark of hope. \"This Master Hyde, if he were studied,\" thought he,  \"must have secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him;  secrets compared to which poor Jekyll's worst would be like  sunshine. Things cannot continue as they are. It turns me cold to  think of this creature stealing like a    23)    thief to Harry's bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening! And the  danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the will,  he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulder to the  wheel if Jekyll will but let me,\" he added, \"if Jekyll will only let  me.\" For once more he"]]]
