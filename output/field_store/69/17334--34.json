It is manifestly evident that  the \"Fall of Adam\" was essential to the accomplishment of the divine  purposes of God in the earth-life of man; which earth-life was designed  for man's progress in that eternal existence which unquestionably is  his. But being a necessity from the nature of things, an essential to  the production of those conditions which would place man in a state of  probation, in which he might gain those experiences, demonstrate that  fidelity, and acquire the strength that shall make him both worthy of,  and able to bear, that eternal weight of glory designed of God for  those able to overcome the evils of earth-life--its temptations and  sins--the \"Fall of Adam,\" I say, being necessary to bring to pass the  conditions of this earth probation for man, it is but just that there  should be some means of free and universal redemption from the effects  of it. For while man, may be held accountable for his personal conduct  under given conditions that do not take from him his freedom, nor the  power to will and to do what is required, he may not in justice be held  accountable for the existence of necessary conditions that establish  the state of probation under which he consents to work. Free and  universal redemption, therefore, is provided for man from those effects  that result from necessity; and hence the Church teaches that \"men will  be punished for their own Sins and not for Adam's transgressions.\" [A]    [Footnote A: A slight alteration has been made in this paragraph since  the publication of this article in the _Improvement Era_.]    But quite apart from the transgression of Adam is man's individual  violations of the laws of righteousness--violations of the laws of  God in which man's agency is exercised; for he sins at times wilfully  and wantonly; knowing the right, he dares to do wrong. Here justice  has a claim upon him and may demand the payment of the penalty to the  uttermost. But the mercy of God as well as his justice is active, and  offers redemption from the consequences of individual transgressions on  the condition of obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.    These laws are not intricate, baffling the understanding. The  ordinances are neither numerous nor difficult of performance; but in  the plan of man's salvation, as in all other works of Deity, simplicity  marks its outlines and efficiency justifies its adoption. The laws and  ordinances referred to have not for their chief object the propitiation  of the anger of God as the old Pagan ordinances of religion had;  but on the contrary, by their nature and operation, they affect the  character of man, and are calculated to so purify and exalt his nature  as to prepare him to dwell in endless felicity in the presence and  companionship of his Maker.    Of necessity Faith in God and in this plan of salvation is of first  importance, and must be an active principle in the mind, for without it  men would consider themselves under no obligation to yield obedience  to any ordinance whatsoever. The reason the infidel does not repent,  or perform any other act of obedience, is because he has or pretends  to have no faith in the existence of God. As from the rising sun there  beams those rays of light which streak the heavens with glory, so from  faith spring those acts of obedience required in the gospel of Jesus  Christ. First among these acts is repentance, which consists not alone  in deep and heartfelt sorrow for sin, but coupled with it must be a  firm determination of amendment of conduct. It must be a godly sorrow  working a reformation of life. Following repentance comes baptism in  water by which men take on them the name of Christ, through which  ordinance also they receive, when it is preceded by faith and true  repentance, forgiveness of sins. But even after a remission of sins,  such is the weakness of human nature that man is not able to stand by  his own strength, he needs divine aid: hence, God has ordained that  through the ordinance of confirmation by the laying on of hands, the  Holy Ghost shall be imparted unto man as a comforter and guide, and by  giving heed to his voice man shall overcome the old inclinations to  evil, and at last so purify and sanctify himself that he will be worthy  to dwell in the presence of his God.    As a further means of grace, the Church of Jesus Christ recognizes  the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, by which men may frequently renew  their covenant with God and witness to each other that they are willing  to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, gratefully remember the  atonement he has made for them, express a willingness to keep his  commandments, and by doing so draw to themselves a constant renewal of  the Spirit of God.    Few and simple as these ordinances are, the Church teaches that in  order to be of effect they must be administered by divine authority. No  man can take the honor upon himself to administer in things pertaining  to God. He must be called by direct revelation from God, or be  commissioned by a divinely authorized power. Here is where \"Mormonism\"  comes in conflict with all Christendom. Men even in the early centuries  of the Christian era having transgressed the laws, changed the  ordinances, broke the covenant, and lost divine authority to administer  the of Jesus Christ--though the letter of the Gospel remained in part  with the world in the writings of the ancient Apostles--there arose a  necessity for the re-opening of the heavens and a restoration of that  priesthood which alone can administer the ordinances of salvation.    That is the significance of the revelations of God and the visitation  of angels to Joseph Smith. To him was revealed anew the gospel, to  him was committed a new dispensation of it, and angels bestowed upon  him the apostleship, the fullness of all priesthood which God gives  to man in the earth, and by its power Joseph Smith and those to whom  he transmitted authority preached the gospel. By the power of that  priesthood they organized the Church of Christ never more to be  destroyed; sustained and upheld by that power the Church has outlived  all the opposition arrayed against it, and stands today planted  impregnably upon the eternal foundations of truth.    But notwithstanding the absence of the gospel and the authority to  administer its ordinances, the children of God living through those  dark ages will not be deprived of its saving powers. That must be a  very contracted view of the great plan of human redemption which would  confine its operations to the brief span of man's existence in this  life. \"Mormonism\" holds no such view. On the contrary, it teaches  that the gospel is everlasting; that it walks beside man throughout  eternity; and means for its application to him have been provided by  the mercy of God. It may be that \"Mormonism\" does not stand alone in  this broad conception of the application of the gospel to our race;  but while others are speculating as to whether it is possible or not  for man to attain unto repentance and forgiveness of sins in his  future existence, \"Mormonism\" is erecting temples to the name of the  Most High, and within their sacred walls the Saints are vicariously  performing the ordinances of salvation for those who have passed from  the earth when the gospel and authority to administer it were not among  the children of men. Such is the conception that Mormonism holds and  teaches of the gospel of Jesus Christ and its application to mankind;  and surely one may see in this conception the fullness of that glorious  scripture which says: God, our Savior, would have all men to be saved,  and come unto the knowledge of the truth. (I Timothy 2:3, 4.)    If asked what the distinguishing characteristics of \"Mormonism\" are, I  should answer:    The acceptance of Jesus Christ as the full and complete revelation of  God to man, in person and in attributes; that as Jesus was and is,--for  to us he still lives, a resurrected, glorified man--so is God, the  Father--a perfected man. This is only saying that as \"the Son is, so  also is the Father.\"    The belief that the spirit of man is in very deed the child of God--his  offspring; that men in reality are brothers to Jesus Christ, and to  each other.    A more pronounced faith than is possessed by other people in the  imminence of God in the world and in men, through the medium of the  divine spirit.    A positive belief in present and continuous revelation.    A broader conception of God's treatment of men in the matter of  revealing himself and his purposes to them.    Acknowledging an inspired priesthood, authorized to direct the affairs  of, and instruct the Church.    The possession of a living faith which lays hold of all the promises  made in the gospel of Jesus Christ; personal communion with God through  the Holy Spirit, and enjoyment of all the spiritual gifts and graces  granted to the saints in any age of the world.    If asked what special benefits \"Mormonism\" has conferred upon mankind,  my answer would be: 1st. That it presents to the world the fullness  of the gospel, with the authority to administer its ordinances; that  through obedience to it men may attain unto all those gifts, graces and  powers known to the ancient saints. It assures them that God in his  relationship to men, is the same today as he was nineteen centuries  ago, that the gospel is the same now as it ever was, and all spiritual  graces and powers that man ever attained to he may possess today. 2nd.  That in the testimony of modern prophets and saints the evidences of  God's existence and the truth of the gospel are so enlarged that the  unbelief which today distresses the religious world and limits the  extension of Christianity would be swept away. 3rd. That in the Book  of Mormon there is evidence of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4776"],[0,"Political Ideals (#3)"],[1," the important  fact that women are excluded.  But our administration is still purely  bureaucratic, and our economic organizations are monarchical or  oligarchic.  Every limited liability company is run by a small number  of self-appointed or coopted directors.  There can be no real  freedom or democracy until the men who do the work in a business also  control its management.    Another measure which would do much to increase liberty would be an  increase of self-government for subordinate groups, whether  geographical or economic or defined by some common belief, like  religious sects.  A modern state is so vast and its machinery is so  little understood that even when a man has a vote he does not feel  himself any effective part of the force which determines its policy.  Except in matters where he can act in conjunction with an  exceptionally powerful group, he feels himself almost impotent, and  the government remains a remote impersonal circumstance, which must be  simply endured, like the weather.  By a share in the control of  smaller bodies, a man might regain some of that sense of personal  opportunity and responsibility which belonged to the citizen of a  city-state in ancient Greece or medieval Italy.    When any group of men has a strong corporate consciousness--such as  belongs, for example, to a nation or a trade or a religious  body--liberty demands that it should be free to decide for itself all  matters which are of great importance to the outside world.  This is  the basis of the universal claim for national independence.  But  nations are by no means the only groups which ought to have  self-government for their internal concerns.  And nations, like other  groups, ought not to have complete liberty of action in matters which  are of equal concern to foreign nations.  Liberty demands  self-government, but not the right to interfere with others.  The  greatest degree of liberty is not secured by anarchy.  The  reconciliation of liberty with government is a difficult problem, but  it is one which any political theory must face.    The essence of government is the use of force in accordance with law  to secure certain ends which the holders of power consider desirable.  The coercion of an individual or a group by force is always in itself  more or less harmful.  But if there were no government, the result  would not be an absence of force in men's relations to each other; it  would merely be the exercise of force by those who had strong  predatory instincts, necessitating either slavery or a perpetual  readiness to repel force with force on the part of those whose  instincts were less violent.  This is the state of affairs at present  in international relations, owing to the fact that no international  government exists.  The results of anarchy between states should  suffice to persuade us that anarchism has no solution to offer for the  evils of the world.    There is probably one purpose, and only one, for which the use of  force by a government is beneficent, and that is to diminish the total  amount of force used m the world.  It is clear, for example, that the  legal prohibition of murder diminishes the total amount of violence in  the world.  And no one would maintain that parents should have  unlimited freedom to ill-treat their children.  So long as some men  wish to do violence to others, there cannot be complete liberty, for  either the wish to do violence must be restrained, or the victims must  be left to suffer.  For this reason, although individuals and  societies should have the utmost freedom as regards their own affairs,  they ought not to have complete freedom as regards their dealings with  others.  To give freedom to the strong to oppress the weak is not the  way to secure the greatest possible amount of freedom in the world.  This is the basis of the socialist revolt against the kind of freedom  which used to be advocated by _laissez-faire_ economists.    Democracy is a device--the best so far invented--for diminishing as  much as possible the interference of governments with liberty.  If a  nation is divided into two sections which cannot both have their way,  democracy theoretically insures that the majority shall have their  way.  But democracy is not at all an adequate device unless it is  accompanied by a very great amount of devolution.  Love of uniformity,  or the mere pleasure of interfering, or dislike of differing tastes  and temperaments, may often lead a majority to control a minority in  matters which do not really concern the majority.  We should none of  us like to have the internal affairs of Great Britain settled by a  parliament of the world, if ever such a body came into existence.  Nevertheless, there are matters which such a body could settle much  better than any existing instrument of government.    The theory of the legitimate use of force in human affairs, where a  government exists, seems clear.  Force should only be used against  those who attempt to use force against others, or against those who  will not respect the law in cases where a common decision is necessary  and a minority are opposed to the action of the majority.  These seem  legitimate occasions for the use of force; and they should be  legitimate occasions in international affairs, if an international  government existed.  The problem of the legitimate occasions for the  use of force in the absence of a government is a different one, with  which we are not at present concerned.    Although a government must have the power to use force, and may on  occasion use it legitimately, the aim of the reformers to have such  institutions as will diminish the need for actual coercion will be  found to have this effect.  Most of us abstain, for instance, from  theft, not because it is illegal, but because we feel no desire to  steal.  The more men learn to live creatively rather than  possessively, the less their wishes will lead them to thwart others or  to attempt violent interference with their liberty.  Most of the  conflicts of interests, which lead individuals or organizations into  disputes, are purely imaginary, and would be seen to be so if men  aimed more at the goods in which all can share, and less at those  private possessions that are the source of strife.  In proportion as  men live creatively, they cease to wish to interfere with others by  force.  Very many matters in which, at present, common action is  thought indispensable, might well be left to individual decision.  It  used to be thought absolutely necessary that all the inhabitants of a  country should have the same religion, but we now know that there is  no such necessity.  In like manner it will be found, as men grow more  tolerant in their instincts, that many uniformities now insisted upon  are useless and even harmful.    Good political institutions would weaken the impulse toward force and  domination in two ways: first, by increasing the opportunities for the  creative impulses, and by shaping education so as to strengthen these  impulses; secondly, by diminishing the outlets for the possessive  instincts.  The diffusion of power, both in the political and the  economic sphere, instead of its concentration in the hands of  officials and captains of industry, would greatly diminish the  opportunities for acquiring the habit of command, out of which the  desire for exercising tyranny is apt to spring.  Autonomy, both for  districts and for organizations, would leave fewer occasions when  governments were called upon to make decisions as to other people's  concerns.  And the abolition of capitalism and the wage system would  remove the chief incentive to fear and greed, those correlative  passions by which all free life is choked and gagged.    Few men seem to realize how many of the evils from which we suffer are  wholly unnecessary, and that they could be abolished by a united  effort within a few years.  If a majority in every civilized country  so desired, we could, within twenty years, abolish all abject poverty,  quite half the illness in the world, the whole economic slavery which  binds down nine tenths of our population; we could fill the world with  beauty and joy, and secure the reign of universal peace.  It is only  because men are apathetic that this is not achieved, only because  imagination is sluggish, and what always has been is regarded as what  always must be.  With good-will, generosity, intelligence, these  things could be brought about.          Chapter II: Capitalism and the Wage System      I    The world is full of preventible evils which most men would be glad to  see prevented.    Nevertheless, these evils persist, and nothing effective is done  toward abolishing them.    This paradox produces astonishment in inexperienced reformers, and too  often produces disillusionment in those who have come to know the  difficulty of changing human institutions.    War is recognized as an evil by an immense majority in every civilized  country; but this recognition does not prevent war.    The unjust distribution of wealth must be obviously an evil to those  who are not prosperous, and they are nine tenths of the population.  Nevertheless it continues unabated.    The tyranny of the holders of power is a source of needless suffering  and misfortune to very large sections of mankind; but power remains in  few hands, and tends, if anything, to grow more concentrated.    I wish first to study the evils of our present institutions, and the  causes of the very limited success of reformers in the past, and then  to suggest reasons for the hope of a more lasting and permanent  success in the near future.    The war has come as a challenge to all who desire a better world.  The  system which cannot save mankind from such an appalling disaster is at  fault somewhere, and cannot be amended in any lasting way unless the  danger of great wars in the future can be made very small.    But war is only the final"]]]
