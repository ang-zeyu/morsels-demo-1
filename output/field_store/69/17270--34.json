Mr. Jackson, will you help me charge the batteries of  my car? I think they need replenishing. Then I'll get right along to  Mansburg.\"    Mansburg was a good-sized city some miles from the village of  Shopton, and Tom and his father had frequent business there.    The young inventor and the engineer soon had the electric car in  readiness for a swift run, for the charging of the batteries could  be done in much less than the time usual for such an operation,  owing to a new system perfected by Tom. The latter was soon speeding  along the road, wondering what sort of an airship Mr. Fenwick would  prove to have, and whether or not it could be made to fly.    \"It's easy enough to build an airship,\" mused Tom, \"but the  difficulty is to get them off the ground, and keep them there.\" He  knew, for there had been several failures with his monoplane before  it rose like a bird and sailed over the tree-tops.    The lad was just entering the town, and had turned around a corner,  twisting about to pass a milk wagon, when he suddenly saw, darting  out directly in the path of his car, a young lady.    \"Look out!\" yelled Tom, ringing his electric gong, at the same time  shutting off the current, and jamming on the powerful brakes.    There was a momentary scream of terror from the girl, and then, as  she looked at Tom, she exclaimed:    \"Why, Tom Swift! What are you trying to do? Run me down?\"    \"Mary--Miss Nestor!\" ejaculated our hero, in some confusion.    He had brought his car to a stop, and had thrown open the door,  alighting on the crossing, while a little knot of curious people  gathered about.    \"I didn't see you,\" went on the lad. \"I came from behind the milk  wagon, and--\"    \"It was my fault,\" Miss Nestor hastened to add. \"I, too, was waiting  for the milk wagon to pass, and when it got out of my way, I darted  around the end of it, without looking to see if anything else was  coming. I should have been more careful, but I'm so excited that I  hardly know what I'm doing.\"    \"Excited? What's the matter?\" asked Tom, for he saw that his friend  was not her usual calm self. \"Has anything happened, Mary?\"    \"Oh, I've such news to tell you!\" she exclaimed.    \"Then get in here, and we'll go on.\" advised Tom. \"We are collecting  a crowd. Come and take a ride; that is if you have time.\"    \"Of course I have,\" the girl said, with a little blush, which Tom  thought made her look all the prettier. \"Then we can talk. But where  are you going?\"    \"To send a message to a gentleman in Philadelphia, saying that I  will help him out of some difficulties with his new electric  airship. I'm going to take a run down there in my monoplane,  BUTTERFLY, to-morrow, and--\"    \"My! to hear you tell it, one would think it wasn't any more to make  an airship flight than it was to go shopping,\" interrupted Mary, as  she entered the electric car, followed by Tom, who quickly sent the  vehicle down the street.    \"Oh, I'm getting used to the upper air,\" he said. \"But what is the  news you were to tell me?\"    \"Did you know mamma and papa had gone to the West Indies?\" asked the  girl.    \"No! I should say that WAS news. When did they go? I didn't know  they intended to make a trip.\"    \"Neither did they; nor I, either. It was very sudden. They sailed  from New York yesterday. Mr. George Hosbrook, a business friend of  papa's, offered to take them on his steam yacht, RESOLUTE. He is  making a little pleasure trip, with a party of friends, and he  thought papa and mamma might like to go.\"    \"He wired to them, they got ready in a rush, caught the express to  New York, and went off in such a hurry that I can hardly realize it  yet. I'm left all alone, and I'm in such trouble!\"    \"Well, I should say that was news,\" spoke Tom.    \"Oh, you haven't heard the worst yet,\" went on Mary. \"I don't call  the fact that papa and mamma went off so suddenly much news. But the  cook just left unexpectedly, and I have invited a lot of girl  friends to come and stay with me, while mamma and papa are away; and  now what shall I do without a cook? I was on my way down to an  intelligence office, to get another servant, when you nearly ran me  down! Now, isn't that news?\"    \"I should say it was--two kinds,\" admitted Tom, with a smile. \"Well,  I'll help you all I can. I'll take you to the intelligence office,  and if you can get a cook, by hook or by crook, I'll bundle her into  this car, and get her to your house before she can change her mind.  And so your people have gone to the West Indies?\"    \"Yes, and I wish I had the chance to go.\"    \"So do I,\" spoke Tom, little realizing how soon his wish might be  granted. \"But is there any particular intelligence office you wish  to visit?\"    \"There's not much choice,\" replied Mary Nestor, with a smile, \"as  there's only one in town. Oh. I do hope I can get a cook! It would  be dreadful to have nothing to eat, after I'd asked the girls to  spend a month with me; wouldn't it?\"    Tom agreed that it certainly would, and they soon after arrived at  the intelligence office.          CHAPTER III    TOM KNOCKS OUT ANDY      \"Do you want me to come in and help you?\" asked the young inventor,  of Miss Nestor.    \"Do you know anything about hiring a cook?\" she inquired, with an  arch smile.    \"I'm afraid I don't,\" the lad was obliged to confess.    \"Then I'm a little doubtful of your ability to help me. But I'm ever  so much obliged to you. I'll see if I can engage one. The cook who  just left went away because I asked her to make some apple  turnovers. Some of the girls who are coming are very fond of them.\"    \"So am I,\" spoke Tom, with a smile.    \"Are you, indeed? Then, if the cook I hope to get now will make  them, I'll invite you over to have some, and--also meet my friends.\"    \"I'd rather come when just you, and the turnovers and the cook are  there,\" declared Tom, boldly, and Mary, with a blush, made ready to  leave the electric car.    \"Thank you,\" she said, in a low voice.    \"If I can't help you select a cook,\" went on Tom, \"at least let me  call and take you home when you have engaged one.\"    \"Oh, it will be too much trouble,\" protested Miss Nestor.    \"Not at all. I have only to send a message, and get some piano wire,  and then I'll call back here for you. I'll take you and the new cook  back home flying.\"    \"All right, but don't fly so fast. The cook may get frightened, and  leave before she has a chance to make an apple turnover.\"    \"I'll go slower. I'll be back in fifteen minutes,\" called Tom, as he  swung the car out away from the curb, while Mary Nestor went into  the intelligence office.    Tom wrote and sent this message to Mr. Hostner Fenwick, of  Philadelphia:    \"Will come on to-morrow in my aeroplane, and aid you all I can. Will  not promise to make your electric airship fly, though. Father sends  regards.\"    \"Just rush that, please,\" he said to the telegraph agent, and the  latter, after reading it over, remarked:    \"It'll rush itself, I reckon, being all about airships, and things  like that,\" and he laughed as Tom paid him.    Selecting several sizes of piano wire of great strength, to use as  extra guy-braces on the Butterfly, Tom re-entered his electric car,  and hastened back to the intelligence office, where he had left his  friend. He saw her standing at the front door, and before he could  alight, and go to her, Miss Nestor came out to meet him.    \"Oh, Tom!\" she exclaimed, with a little tragic gesture, \"what do you  think?\"    \"I don't know,\" he answered good-naturedly. \"Does the new cook  refuse to come unless you do away with apple turnovers?\"    \"No, it isn't that. I have engaged a real treasure, I'm sure, but as  soon as I mentioned that you would take us home in the electric  automobile, she flatly refused to come. She said walking was the  only way she would go. She hasn't been in this country long. But the  worst of it is that a rich woman has just telephoned in for a cook,  and if I don't get this one away, the rich lady may induce her to  come to her house, and I'll be without one! Oh, what shall I do?\"  and poor Mary looked quite distressed.    \"Humph! So she's afraid of electric autos; eh?\" mused Tom. \"That's  queer. Leave it to me, Mary, and perhaps I can fix it. You want to  get her away from here in a hurry; don't you?\"    \"Yes, because servants are so scarce, that they are engaged almost  as soon as they register at the intelligence office. I know the one  I have hired is suspicious of me, since I have mentioned your car,  and she'll surely go with Mrs. Duy Puyster when she comes. I'm sorry  I spoke of the automobile.\"    \"Well, don't worry. It's partly my fault, and perhaps I can make  amends. I'll talk to the new cook,\" decided the young inventor.    \"Oh, Tom, I don't believe it will do any good. She won't come, and  all my girl friends will arrive shortly.\" Miss Nestor was quite  distressed.    \"Leave it to me,\" suggested the lad, with an assumed confidence he  did not feel. He left the car, and walked toward the office.  Entering it, with Miss Nestor in his wake, he saw a pleasant-faced  Irish girl, sitting on a bench, with a bundle beside her.    \"And so you don't want to ride in an auto?\" began Tom.    \"No, an' it's no use of the likes of you askin' me, either,\"  answered the girl, but not impudently. \"I am afeered of thim things,  an' I won't work in a family that owns one.\"    \"But we don't own one,\" said Mary.    The girl only sniffed.    \"It is the very latest means of traveling,\" Tom went on, \"and there  is absolutely no danger. I will drive slowly.\"    \"No!\" snapped the new cook.    Tom was rather at his wits' ends. At that moment the telephone rang,  and Tom and Mary, listening, could hear the proprietress of the  intelligence office talking to Mrs. Duy Puyster over the wire.    \"We must get her away soon,\" whispered Mary, with a nod at the Irish  girl, \"or we'll lose her.\"    Tom was thinking rapidly, but no plan "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4230"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle; Or, Fun and Adventures on the Road (#3)"],[1,"had questioned Mr. Merton were the same.    \"There is something going on, that dad should know about,\" reflected  Tom. \"I must tell him. I don't believe it will be wise to send any  more of his patent work over to Merton. We must do it in the shops  at home, and dad and I will have to keep our eyes open. There may be  spies about seeking to discover something about his new turbine  motor. I'll hurry back with those bolts and tell dad. But first I  must get lunch. I'll go to the restaurant and have a good feed while  I'm at it.\"    Tom had plenty of spending money, some of which came from a small  patent he had marketed himself. He left his wheel outside the  restaurant, first taking the precaution to chain the wheels, and  then went inside. Tom was hungry and ordered a good meal. He was  about half way through it when some one called his name.    \"Hello, Ned!\" he answered, looking up to see a youth about his own  age. \"Where did you blow in from?\"    \"Oh, I came over from Shopton this morning,\" replied Ned Newton,  taking a seat at the table with Tom. The two lads were chums, and in  their younger days had often gone fishing, swimming and hunting  together. Now Ned worked in the Shopton bank, and Tom was so busy  helping his father, so they did not see each other so often.    \"On business or pleasure?\" asked Tom, putting some more sugar in his  coffee.    \"Business. I had to bring some papers over from our bank to the  First National here. But what about you?\"    \"Oh, I came on dad's account.\"    \"Invented anything new?\" asked Ned as he gave his order to the  waitress.    \"No, nothing since the egg-beater I was telling you about. But I'm  working on some things.\"    \"Why don't you invent an automobile or an airship?\"    \"Maybe I will some day, but, speaking of autos, did you see the one  Andy Foger has?\"    \"Yes; it's a beaut! Have you seen it?\"    \"Altogether at too close range. He nearly ran over me this morning,\"  and the young inventor related the occurrence.    \"Oh, Andy always was too fresh,\" commented Ned; \"and since his  father let him get the touring car I suppose he'll be worse than  ever.\"    \"Well, if he tries to run me down again he'll get into trouble,\"  declared Tom, calling for a second cup of coffee.    The two chums began conversing on more congenial topics, and Ned was  telling of a new camera he had, when, from a table directly behind  him, Tom heard some one say in rather loud tones:    \"The plant is located in Shopton, all right, and the buildings are  near Swift's house.\"    Tom started, and listened more intently.    \"That will make it more difficult,\" one man answered. \"But if the  invention is as valuable as--\"    \"Hush!\" came a caution from another of the party. \"This is too  public a place to discuss the matter. Wait until we get out. One of  us will have to see Swift, of course, and if he proves stubborn--\"    \"I guess you'd better hush yourself,\" retorted the man who had first  spoken, and then the voices subsided.    But Tom Swift had overheard something which made him vaguely afraid.  He started so at the sound of his father's name that he knocked a  fork from the table.    \"What's the matter; getting nervous?\" asked Ned with a laugh.    \"I guess so,\" replied Tom, and when he stooped to pick the fork up,  not waiting for the girl who was serving at his table, he stole a  look at the strangers who had just entered. He was startled to note  that one of the men was the same he had seen in the post-office--the  man who answered the description of the one who had been inquiring  of Mr. Merton about the Swift shops.    \"I'm going to keep my ears open,\" thought Tom as he went on eating  his dinner.          CHAPTER III.    IN A SMASH-UP      Though the young inventor listened intently, in an endeavor to hear  the conversation of the men at the table behind him, all he could  catch was an indistinct murmur. The strangers appeared to have  heeded the caution of one of their number and were speaking in low  tones.    Tom and Ned finished their meal, and started to leave the  restaurant. As Mr. Swift's son passed the table where the men sat  they looked up quickly at him. Two of them gave Tom but a passing  glance, but one--he whom the young inventor had noticed in the  post-office--stared long and intently.    \"I think he will know me the next time he sees me,\" thought Tom, and  he boldly returned the glance of the stranger.    The bolts were ready when the inventor's son called at the machine  shop a second time, and making a package of them Tom fastened it to  the saddle of his bicycle. He started for home at a fast pace, and  was just turning from a cross road into the main highway when he saw  ahead of him a woman driving a light wagon. As the sun flashed on  Tom's shining wheel the horse gave a sudden leap, swerved to one  side, and then bolted down the dusty stretch, the woman screaming at  the top of her voice.    \"A runaway!\" cried Tom; \"and partly my fault, too!\"    Waiting not an instant the lad bent over his handle-bars and pedaled  with all his force. His bicycle seemed fairly to leap forward after  the galloping horse.    \"Sit still! Don't jump out! Don't jump!\" yelled the young inventor.  \"I'll try to catch him!\" for the woman was standing up in front of  the seat and leaning forward, as if about to leap from the wagon.    \"She's lost her head,\" thought Tom. \"No wonder! That's a skittish  horse.\"    Faster and faster he rode, bending all his energies to overtake the  animal. The wagon was swaying from side to side, and more than once  the woman just saved herself from being thrown out by grasping the  edge of the seat. She found that her standing position was a  dangerous one and crouched on the bottom of the swaying vehicle.    \"That's better!\" shouted Tom, but it is doubtful if she heard him,  for the rattling of the wagon and the hoofbeats of the horse drowned  all other sounds. \"Sit still!\" he shouted. \"I'll stop the horse for  you!\"    Trying to imagine himself in a desperate race, in order to excite  himself to greater speed, Tom continued on. He was now even with the  tail-board of the wagon, and slowly creeping up. The woman was all  huddled up in a lump.    \"Grab the reins! Grab the reins!\" shouted Tom. \"Saw on the bit! That  will stop him!\"    The occupant of the wagon turned to look at the lad. Tom saw that  she was a handsome young lady. \"Grab the reins!\" he cried again.  \"Pull hard!\"    \"I--I can't!\" she answered frightenedly. \"They have dropped down!  Oh, do please stop the horse! I'm so--so frightened!\"    \"I'll stop him!\" declared the youth firmly, and he set his teeth  hard. Then he saw the reason the fair driver could not grasp the  lines. They had slipped over the dashboard and were trailing on the  ground.    The horse was slacking speed a bit now, for the pace was telling on  his wind. Tom saw his opportunity, and with a sudden burst of energy  was at the animal's head. Steering his wheel with one hand, with the  other the lad made a grab for the reins near the bit. The horse  swerved frightenedly to one side, but Tom swung in the same  direction. He grasped the leather and then, with a kick, he freed  himself from the bicycle, giving it a shove to one side. He was now  clinging to the reins with both hands, and, being a muscular lad and  no lightweight, his bulk told.    \"Sit--still!\" panted our hero to the young woman, who had arisen to  the seat. \"I'll have him stopped in half a minute now!\"    It was in less time than that, for the horse, finding it impossible  to shake off the grip of Tom, began to slow from a gallop to a trot,  then to a canter, and finally to a slow walk. A moment later the  horse had stopped, breathing heavily from his run.    \"There, there, now!\" spoke Tom soothingly. \"You're all right, old  fellow. I hope you're not hurt\"--this to the young lady--and Tom  made a motion to raise his cap, only to find that it had blown off.    \"Oh, no--no; I'm more frightened than hurt.\"    \"It was all my fault,\" declared the young inventor. \"I should not  have swung into the road so suddenly. My bicycle alarmed your  horse.\"    \"Oh, I fancy Dobbin is easily disturbed,\" admitted the fair driver.  \"I can't thank you enough for stopping him. You saved me from a bad  accident.\"    \"It was the least I could do. Are you all right now?\" and he handed  up the dangling reins. \"I think Dobbin, as you call him, has had  enough of running,\" went on Tom, for the horse was now quiet.    \"I hope so. Yes, I am all right. I trust your wheel is not damaged.  If it is, my father, Mr. Amos Nestor, of Mansburg, will gladly pay  for its repair.\"    This reminded the young inventor of his bicycle, and making sure  that the horse would not start up again, he went to where his wheel  and his cap lay. He found that the only damage to the bicycle was a  few bent spokes, and, straightening them and having again apologized  to the young woman, receiving in turn her pardon and thanks, and  learning that her name was Mary Nestor, Tom once more resumed his  trip. The wagon followed him at a distance, the horse evincing no  desire now to get out of a slow amble.    \"Well, things are certainly happening to me to-day,\" mused Tom as he  pedaled on. \"That might have been a serious runaway if there'd been  anything in the road.\"    Tom did not stop to think that he had been mainly instrumental in  preventing a bad accident, as he had been the innocent cause of  starting the runaway, but Tom was ever a modest lad. His arms were  wrenched from jerking on the bridle, but he did not mind that much,  and bent over the handle-bars to make up for lost time.    Our hero was within a short distance of his house and was coasting  easily along when, just ahead of him, he saw a cloud of dust, very  similar to the one that had, some time before, concealed the  inexperienced motor-cyclist.    \"I wonder if that's him again?\" thought Tom. \"If it is I'm going to  hang back until I see which"]]]
