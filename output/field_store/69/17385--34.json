The solemn style of the Book of Mormon in      imitation of the English scriptures does not appear in      the manuscript.  * * *  Some other explanation of the      origin of the Book of Mormon must be found if any      explanation is required.    The manuscript was deposited in the library of Oberlin College  where it now reposes.  Still, the theory of the \"Manuscript  Found,\" as Spaulding's story has come to be known, is  occasionally pressed into service in the cause of anti-\"Mormon\"  zeal, by some whom we will charitably believe to be ignorant of  the facts set forth by President Fairchild.  A letter of more  recent date, written by that honorable gentleman in reply to an  inquiring correspondent, was published in the _Millennial Star_,  Liverpool, November 3, 1898, and is as follows:                                     OBERLIN COLLEGE, OHIO,                                        October 17, 1895.        J. R. HINDLEY, ESQ.,        Dear Sir: We have in our college library an original      manuscript of Solomon Spaulding--unquestionably      genuine.        I found it in 1884 in the hands of Hon. L. L. Rice,      of Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands.  He was formerly state      printer at Columbus, Ohio, and before that, publisher      of a paper in Painesville, whose preceding publisher      had visited Mrs. Spaulding and obtained the manuscript      from her.  It had lain among his old papers forty      years or more, and was brought out by my asking him to      look up anti-slavery documents among his papers.        The manuscript has upon it the signatures of several      men of Conneaught, Ohio, who had heard Spaulding read      it and knew it to be his.  No one can see it and      question its genuineness.  The manuscript has been      printed twice, at least;--once by the Mormons of Salt      Lake City, and once by the Josephite Mormons of Iowa.      The Utah Mormons obtained the copy of Mr. Rice, at      Honolulu, and the Josephites got it of me after it      came into my possession.        This manuscript is not the original of the Book of      Mormon.                Yours very truly,                      JAMES H. FAIRCHILD.    The \"Manuscript Story\" has been published in full, and  comparisons between the same and the Book of Mormon may be made  by anyone who has a mind to investigate the subject.[1]    [Footnote 1: For a fuller account of the Book of Mormon, see the  author's \"Articles of Faith,\" Lectures 14 and 15; published at  Salt Lake City, Utah, 1913.]        CHAPTER II    But we have anticipated the current of events.  With the  publication of the Book of Mormon, opposition grew more intense  toward the people who professed a belief in the testimony of  Joseph Smith.  On the 6th of April, 1830, the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints was formally organized and thus took  on a legal existence.  The scene of this organization was  Fayette, New York, and but six persons were directly concerned as  participants.  At that time there may have been and probably were  many times that number who had professed adherence to the newly  restored faith; but as the requirements of the law governing the  formation of religious societies were satisfied by the  application of six, only the specified number formally took part.  Such was the beginning of the Church, soon to be so universally  maligned.  Its origin was small--a germ, an insignificant seed,  hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition.  What was  there to fear in the voluntary association of six men, avowedly  devoted to peaceful pursuits and benevolent purposes?  Yet a  storm of persecution was threatened from the earliest day.  At  first but a family affair, opposition to the work has involved  successively the town, the county, the state, the country, and  today the \"Mormon\" question has been accorded extended  consideration at the hands of the national government, and indeed  most civilized nations have taken cognizance of the same.    Let us observe the contrast between the beginning and the present  proportions of the Church.  Instead of but six regularly  affiliated members, and at most two score of adherents, the  organization numbers today many hundred thousand souls.  In place  of a single hamlet, in the smallest corner of which the members  could have congregated, there now are about seventy stakes of  Zion and about seven hundred organized wards, each ward and stake  with its full complement of officers and priesthood  organizations.  The practise of gathering its proselytes into one  place prevents the building up and strengthening of foreign  branches; and inasmuch as extensive and strong organizations are  seldom met with abroad, very erroneous ideas exist concerning the  strength of the Church.  Nevertheless, the mustard seed, among  the smallest of all seeds, has attained the proportions of a  tree, and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches; the  acorn is now an oak offering protection and the sweets of  satisfaction to every earnest pilgrim journeying its way for  truth.    From the organization of the Church, the spirit of emigration  rested upon the people.  Their eyes were from the first turned in  anticipation toward the evening sun--not merely that the work of  proselyting should be carried on in the west, but that the  headquarters of the Church should be there established.  The Book  of Mormon had taught the people the true origin and destiny of  the American Indians; and toward this dark-skinned remnant of a  once mighty people, the missionaries of \"Mormonism\" early turned  their eyes, and with their eyes went their hearts and their  hopes.    Within three months from the beginning, the Church had  missionaries among the Lamanites.  It is notable that the Indian  tribes have generally regarded the religion of the Latter-day  Saints with favor, seeing in the Book of Mormon striking  agreement with their own traditions.    The first well-established seat of the Church was in the pretty  little town of Kirtland, Ohio, almost within sight of Lake Erie;  and here soon rose the first temple of modern times.  Among their  many other peculiarities, the Latter-day Saints are characterized  as a temple-building people, as history proves the Israel of  ancient times to have been.  In the days of their infancy as a  Church, while in the thrall of poverty, and amidst the  persecution and direful threats of lawless hordes, they laid the  cornerstone, and in less than three years thereafter they  celebrated the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, a structure at  once beautiful and imposing.  Even before this time, however,  populous settlements of Latter-day Saints had been made in  Jackson County, Missouri; and in the town of Independence a site  for a great temple had been selected and purchased; but though  the ground has been dedicated with solemn ceremony, the people  have not as yet built thereon.    Within two years of its dedication, the temple in Kirtland was  abandoned by the people, who were compelled to flee for their  lives before the onslaughts of mobocrats; but a second temple,  larger and more beautiful than the first, soon reared its spires  in the city of Nauvoo, Illinois.  This structure was destroyed by  fire, but the temple-building spirit was not to be quenched, and  in the vales of Utah today are four magnificent temple edifices.  The last completed, which was the first begun, is situated in  Salt Lake City, and is one of the wonders and beauties of that  city by the great salt sea.[2]    [Footnote 2: For a detailed account of modern temples, with  numerous pictorial views, see \"The House of the Lord,\" by the  present author; Salt Lake City, Utah, 1912.]    To the fervent Latter-day Saint, a temple is not simply a church  building, a house for religious assembly.  Indeed the \"Mormon\"  temples are rarely used as places of general gatherings.  They  are in one sense educational institutions, regular courses of  lectures and instruction being maintained in some of them; but  they are specifically for baptisms and ordinations, for  sanctifying prayer, and for the most sacred ceremonies and rites  of the Church, particularly in the vicarious work for the dead  which is a characteristic of \"Mormon\" faith.  And who that has  gazed upon these splendid shrines will say that the people who  can do so much in poverty and tribulation are insincere?  Bigoted  they may seem to those who believe not as they do; fanatics they  may be to multitudes who like the proud Pharisee of old thank God  they are not as these; but insincere they cannot be, even in the  judgment of their bitterest opponent, if he be a creature of  reason.    The clouds of persecution thickened in Ohio as the intolerant  zeal of mobs found frequent expression; numerous charges, trivial  and serious, were made against the leaders of the Church, and  they were repeatedly brought before the courts, only to be  liberated on the usual finding of no cause for action.  Meanwhile  the march to the west was maintained.  Soon thousands of converts  had rented or purchased homes in Missouri--Independence, Jackson  County, being their center; but from the first, they were  unpopular among the Missourians.  Their system of equal rights  with their marked disapproval of every species of aristocratic  separation and self-aggrandizement was declared to be a species  of communism, dangerous to the state.  An inoffensive  journalistic organ, _The Star_, published for the purpose of  properly presenting the religious tenets of the people, was made  the particular object of the mob's rage; the house of its  publisher was razed to the ground, the press and type were  confiscated, and the editor and his family maltreated.  An absurd  story was circulated and took firm hold of the masses that the  Book of Mormon promised the western lands to the people of the  Church, and that they intended to take"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5632"],[0,"Five Little Peppers Midway (#3)"],[1,"tell me all about her.\"    \"You have well said,\" observed Mr. King, seating himself with the  utmost deliberateness, and drawing Phronsie to her accustomed place on  his knee, where she nestled, regardless of his immaculate linen and  fine waistcoat, \"Phronsie Pepper is indeed a fine child; a very fine  child, Madam.\"    \"Oh, my, and Oh, my!\" cried Mrs. Chatterton, holding up her hands, \"to  think that you can so demean yourself; why, she's actually mussing your  shirt-front with her dirty little hands!\"    \"Phronsie Pepper's hands are never dirty, Madam,\" said the old  gentleman gravely. \"Sit still, child,\" as Phronsie in a state of alarm  struggled to slip down from his lap, thrusting the two members thus  referred to, well out before her.    Mrs. Chatterton burst into a loud laugh. \"To think I have come to see  Horatio King in such a state! Jasper Horatio King!\" she repeated  scornfully. \"I heard about it through the Bascombs' letters, but I  wouldn't believe it till I used my eyes. It's positively dreadful!\"    Mr. King put back his head and laughed also; so heartily, that Phronsie  ceased to struggle, and turned to regard him in silent astonishment;  and Mrs. Whitney, charmed that the rage usually produced by  conversation with Cousin Algernon's wife was not forthcoming, began to  laugh, too, so that the amusement of the tall lady was quenched in the  general hilarity.    \"What you can find in my words to cause such an unseemly outburst, I  cannot see,\" she cried in a passion.    \"I'm under the impression that you led off the amusement yourself,\"  said Mr. King, wiping his eyes. \"Phronsie, it's all very funny, isn't  it?\" looking down into the little wondering face.    \"Is it really funny?\" asked Phronsie. \"Does the lady like it?\"    \"Not particularly, I suspect,\" said Mr. King carelessly.    \"And that you can talk with that chit, ignoring me, your cousin's wife,  is insufferable.\" Mrs. Chatterton now arose speedily from the divan,  and shook out a flounce or two with great venom. \"I had intended to  make you a visit. Now it is quite impossible.\"    \"As you like,\" said the old gentleman, also rising, and placing  Phronsie on her feet, observing ostentatious care to keep her hand. \"My  house is open to you, Eunice,\" with a wave of his disengaged hand in  old-time hospitality, \"but of course you must suit yourself.\"    \"It's rather hard upon a person of sensibility, to come home after a  six years' absence,\" said Cousin Eunice with a pathetic sniff, and once  more seeking her vinaigrette in the depths of the silken bag, \"to meet  only coldness and derision. In fact, it is very hard.\"    \"No doubt, no doubt,\" said the old gentleman hastily, \"I can imagine  such a case, but it has nothing to do with you. Now, if you are going  to stay, Eunice, say so at once, and proceed to your room. If not, why  you must go, and understand it is no one's fault but your own.\"    He drew himself up and looked long and hard into the thin pale face  before him. Phronsie pulled at his hand.    \"I want to ask the lady to stay, Grandpapa dear.\"    \"She doesn't need urging,\" said old Mr. King quite distinctly, and not  moving a muscle.    \"But, Grandpapa dear, she isn't glad about something.\"    \"No more am I.\"    \"Grandpapa,\" cried Phronsie, moving off a bit, though not deserting his  hand, and standing on her tiptoes, \"I want her to stay, to see me.  Perhaps she hasn't any little girls.\"    \"To see you?\" cried Mr. King irately. \"Say no more, child, say no more.  She's been abusing you right and left, like a pick-pocket.\"    \"What is a pick-pocket?\" asked Phronsie, getting down from her tiptoes.    \"Oh! a scoundrel who puts his hands into pockets; picks out what  doesn't belong to him, in fact.\"    Phronsie stood quite still, and shook her head gravely at the tall  figure. \"That was not nice,\" she said soberly.    \"Now do you want her to stay?\" cried the old gentleman.    \"Insufferable!\" repeated Mrs. Chatterton between her teeth, \"to mix me  up with that chit!\"    \"Yes, I do,\" said Phronsie decidedly, \"I do, Grandpapa. Now I know she  hasn't any little girls--if she had little girls, she wouldn't say such  very unnice things; I want the poor lady to stay with me.\"    Mrs. Chatterton turned and went abruptly off to the door, hesitated,  and looked back.    \"I see your household is in a very chaotic state, Cousin Horatio. Still  I will remain a few days,\" with extreme condescension, \"on condition  that these Peppers are not thrust upon my attention.\"    \"I make no conditions,\" said the old gentleman coolly. \"If you stay,  you must accept my household as you find it.\"    \"Come, Marian,\" said Mrs. Chatterton, holding out her hand to Mrs.  Whitney. \"You may help me to my apartments if you like. I am quite  unstrung by all this,\" and she swept out without a backward glance.    \"Has she gone?\" cried Jasper, hurrying in with Polly running after.  \"It's 'stay,' isn't it, father?\" as he saw the old gentleman's face.    \"Yes,\" said Mr. King grimly, \"it is 'stay' indeed, Jasper.\"    \"Well, now then, you've a piece of work on your hands about the biggest  you ever did yet, Polly Pepper!\" cried Jasper, \"to make things  comfortable in this house. I shall be just as cross as can be imagined,  to begin with.\"    \"You cross!\" cried Polly.    \"Cross as a bear; Marian will fight against the prevailing ill wind,  but it will finally blow her down to a state of depression where her  best friend wouldn't recognize her, and\"--    \"You don't mention me, my boy,\" said Mr. King dryly.    Jasper looked into his father's eyes, and they both laughed.    \"And if you, Polly Pepper, don't keep things bright, why, we shall all  go to the dogs,\" said the old gentleman, sobering down. \"So mind you  do, and we'll try to bear Cousin Algernon's relict.\"    \"I will,\" said Polly stoutly, though \"relict\" sounded very dreadful to  begin with.    \"Give us your hand, then,\" said Jasper's father, putting out his palm.  \"There!\" releasing it, \"now I'm much more comfortable about matters.\"    \"And give me your hand, Polly,\" cried Jasper, his own brown hand flying  to meet hers. \"There! and now I'm comfortable too! So it's a compact,  and a sure one!\"    \"And I want to give my hand,\" cried Phronsie, very much aggrieved.  \"Here, Jasper.\"    \"Bless my soul, so you must!\" cried old Mr. King; \"to think we didn't  ask you first. There--and there!\"    \"And, Phronsie darling,\" cried Polly in a rapture, \"you must promise  with me, after you have with the others. I couldn't ever get along in  all this world without that.\"    So the ceremony of sealing the compact having been observed with great  gravity, Phronsie drew a long breath, and now felt that the \"poor lady\"  might come down at any time to find all things prepared for her.    \"Now tell our plan,\" cried Jasper to Polly, \"and put this disagreeable  business out of our heads. It's a fine one,\" he added to his father.    \"Of course it is,\" cried the old gentleman.    \"Well, you know Joel and Davie and Van and Percy are coming home from  school next week for the Christmas holidays,\" began Polly, trying to  still the wild beating of her heart.    \"Bless me! so they are,\" said Mr. King. \"How time flies, to be sure!  Well, go on, Polly.\"    \"And we ought to do something to celebrate,\" said Polly, \"at least  don't you think so?\" she asked anxiously, looking up in his face.    \"To be sure I do,\" cried the old gentleman heartily. \"Well, what would  you do, Polly child, to show the youngsters we're proud of them, and  glad to get them back--hey?\"    \"We want to get up a little play,\" said Polly, \"Jasper and I, and act  it.\"    \"And have music,\" cried Jasper. \"Polly shall play on the piano. The  boys will be so delighted to see how she has improved.\"    \"And Jasper will play too,\" cried Polly eagerly. \"Oh, Jasper! will you  play that concerto, the one you played when Mary Gibbs was here at tea  last week? Do, Jasper, do.\"    \"That nearly floored me,\" said Jasper.    \"No; you said it was Mary's watching you like a lynx--you know you  did,\" said Polly, laughing merrily.    \"Never mind,\" said the old gentleman. \"What next, Polly? The play is  all right.\"    \"I should think it was,\" cried Jasper. \"It's the Three Dragons, and the  Princess Clotilde.\"    \"Oh, my goodness,\" exclaimed Mr. King, \"What a play for Christmas Eve!\"    \"Well, you'll say it's a splendid hit!\" cried Jasper, \"when you see it  from the private box we are going to give you.\"    \"So you are intending to honor me, are you?\" cried his father, vastly  pleased to find himself as ever, the central figure in their plans.  \"Well, well, I dare say it will all be as fine as can be to welcome  these young scapegraces home. What next, Polly?\"    \"It must be kept a perfect surprise,\" cried Polly, clasping her hands  while the color flew over her face. \"No one must even whisper it to  each other, the day before Christmas when the boys get here, for Joel  is so very dreadful whenever there is a secret.\"    \"His capacity certainly is good,\" said Mr. King dryly. \"We will all be  very careful.\"    \"And Phronsie is to be Princess Clotilde,\" cried Jasper, seizing her  suddenly, to prance around the room, just like old times.    \"Oh, Jasper! I'm eight years old,\" she cried, struggling to free  herself.    \"Nonsense! What of it--you are the baby of this household.\" But he set  her on her feet nevertheless, one hand still patting the soft yellow  waves over her brow. \"Go on, Polly, do, and lay the whole magnificence  before father. He will be quite overcome.\"    \"That would be disastrous,\" said Mr. King; \"better save your effects  till the grand affair comes off.\"    \"Jasper is to be one of the dragons,\" announced Polly, quite in her  element, \"that is, the head dragon; Ben is to be another, and we  haven't quite decided whether to ask Archy Hurd or Clare to take the  third one.\"    \"Clare has the most 'go' in him,\" said Jasper critically.    \"Then I think we'll decide now to ask him,\" said"]]]
