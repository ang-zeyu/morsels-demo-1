They patted it with their little soft paws--\"Shall we make dear little  muffins?\" said Mittens to Moppet.    But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet  jumped into the flour barrel in a fright.    Mittens ran away to the dairy, and hid in an empty jar on the stone  shelf where the milk pans stand.    The visitor was a neighbor, Mrs. Ribby; she had called to borrow some  yeast.    Mrs. Tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfully--\"Come in, Cousin Ribby,  come in, and sit ye down! I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby,\" said  Tabitha, shedding tears. \"I've lost my dear son Thomas; I'm afraid the  rats have got him.\" She wiped her eyes with an apron.    \"He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best  bonnet last time I came to tea. Where have you looked for him?\"    \"All over the house! The rats are too many for me. What a thing it is to  have an unruly family!\" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.    \"I'm not afraid of rats; I will help you to find him; and whip him too!  What is all that soot in the fender?\"    \"The chimney wants sweeping--Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby--now Moppet and  Mittens are gone!\"    \"They have both got out of the cup-board!\"    Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again. They  poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella, and they rummaged in  cupboards. They even fetched a candle, and looked inside a clothes chest  in one of the attics. They could not find anything, but once they heard  a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs.    \"Yes, it is infested with rats,\" said Tabitha tearfully, \"I caught seven  young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for  dinner last Saturday. And once I saw the old father rat--an enormous old  rat, Cousin Ribby. I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his  yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole.\"    \"The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby,\" said Tabitha.    Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched. They both heard a curious  roly-poly noise under the attic floor. But there was nothing to be seen.    They returned to the kitchen. \"Here's one of your kittens at least,\"  said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel.    They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor. She  seemed to be in a terrible fright.    \"Oh! Mother, Mother,\" said Moppet, \"there's been an old woman rat in the  kitchen, and she's stolen some of the dough!\"    The two cats ran to look at the dough pan. Sure enough there were marks  of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!    \"Which way did she go, Moppet?\"    But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.    Ribby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while  they went on with their search.    They went into the dairy.    The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding in an empty jar.    They tipped up the jar, and she scrambled out.    \"Oh, Mother, Mother!\" said Mittens--    \"Oh! Mother, Mother, there has been an old man rat in the dairy--a  dreadful 'normous big rat, Mother; and he's stolen a pat of butter and  the rolling-pin.\"    Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another.    \"A rolling-pin and butter! Oh, my poor son Thomas!\" exclaimed Tabitha,  wringing her paws.    \"A rolling-pin?\" said Ribby. \"Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the  attic when we were looking into that chest?\"    Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again. Sure enough the roly-poly noise  was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.    \"This is serious, Cousin Tabitha,\" said Ribby. \"We must send for John  Joiner at once, with a saw.\"    Now this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very  unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does  not know his way, and where there are enormous rats.    Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard. When he saw that  his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide.    He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the  chimney.    The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a  white choky smoke from the green sticks. Tom Kitten got upon the fender  and looked up. It was a big old-fashioned fireplace.    The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk  about. So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat.    He jumped right up into the fireplace, balancing himself upon the iron  bar where the kettle hangs.    Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar, and landed on a ledge high  up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender.    Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; he could hear the sticks  beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below. He made up  his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try  to catch sparrows.    \"I cannot go back. If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my  beautiful tail and my little blue jacket.\"    The chimney was a very big old-fashioned one. It was built in the days  when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.    The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and  the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that  kept out the rain.    Tom Kitten was getting very frightened! He climbed up, and up, and up.    Then he waded sideways through inches of soot. He was like a little  sweep himself.    It was most confusing in the dark. One flue seemed to lead into another.    There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost.    He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to  a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall. There were some  mutton bones lying about--    \"This seems funny,\" said Tom Kitten. \"Who has been gnawing bones up here  in the chimney? I wish I had never come! And what a funny smell! It is  something like mouse; only dreadfully strong. It makes me sneeze,\" said  Tom Kitten.    He squeezed through the hole in the wall, and dragged himself along a  most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light.    He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the  skirting-board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the  picture.    All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed  on a heap of very dirty rags.    When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him--he found himself  in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his  life in the house.    It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and  cobwebs, and lath and plaster.    Opposite to him--as far away as he could sit--was an enormous rat.    \"What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?\" said  the rat, chattering his teeth.    \"Please sir, the chimney wants sweeping,\" said poor Tom Kitten.    \"Anna Maria! Anna Maria!\" squeaked the rat. There was a pattering noise  and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.    All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was  happening--    His coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with  string in very hard knots.    Anna Maria did the tying. The old rat watched her and took snuff. When  she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open.    \"Anna Maria,\" said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel  Whiskers),--\"Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for  my dinner.\"    \"It requires dough and a pat of butter, and a rolling-pin,\" said Anna  Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side.    \"No,\" said Samuel Whiskers, \"make it properly, Anna Maria, with  breadcrumbs.\"    \"Nonsense! Butter and dough,\" replied Anna Maria.    The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.    Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot, and went boldly down  the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter. He did not meet  anybody.    He made a second journey for the rolling-pin. He pushed it in front of  him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel.    He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were busy lighting the  candle to look into the chest.    They did not see him.    Anna Maria went down by way of the skirting-board and a window shutter  to the kitchen to steal the dough.    She borrowed a small saucer, and scooped up the dough with her paws.    She did not observe Moppet.    While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he  wriggled about and tried to mew for help.    But his mouth was full of soot and cob-webs, and he was tied up in such  very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him.    Except a spider, which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined  the knots critically, from a safe distance.    It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate  blue-bottles. It did not offer to assist him.    Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.    Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a  dumpling. First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him  in the dough.    \"Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?\" inquired Samuel  Whiskers.    Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she  wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the  pastry. She laid hold of his ears.    Tom Kitten bit and spat, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling-pin  went roly-poly, roly; roly, poly, roly. The rats each held an end.    \"His tail is sticking out! You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria.\"    \"I fetched as much as I could carry,\" replied Anna Maria.    \"I do not think\"--said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom  Kitten--\"I do NOT think it will be a good pudding. It smells sooty.\"    Anna Maria was about to argue the point, when all at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5827"],[0,"The Problems of Philosophy (#3)"],[1,"his own existence was not possible, for if he did  not exist, no demon could deceive him. If he doubted, he must exist; if  he had any experiences whatever, he must exist. Thus his own existence  was an absolute certainty to him. 'I think, therefore I am,' he said  (_Cogito, ergo sum_); and on the basis of this certainty he set to work  to build up again the world of knowledge which his doubt had laid in  ruins. By inventing the method of doubt, and by showing that subjective  things are the most certain, Descartes performed a great service to  philosophy, and one which makes him still useful to all students of the  subject.    But some care is needed in using Descartes' argument. 'I think,  therefore I am' says rather more than is strictly certain. It might seem  as though we were quite sure of being the same person to-day as we were  yesterday, and this is no doubt true in some sense. But the real Self is  as hard to arrive at as the real table, and does not seem to have that  absolute, convincing certainty that belongs to particular experiences.  When I look at my table and see a certain brown colour, what is quite  certain at once is not '_I_ am seeing a brown colour', but rather,  'a brown colour is being seen'. This of course involves something (or  somebody) which (or who) sees the brown colour; but it does not of  itself involve that more or less permanent person whom we call 'I'. So  far as immediate certainty goes, it might be that the something which  sees the brown colour is quite momentary, and not the same as the  something which has some different experience the next moment.    Thus it is our particular thoughts and feelings that have primitive  certainty. And this applies to dreams and hallucinations as well as to  normal perceptions: when we dream or see a ghost, we certainly do have  the sensations we think we have, but for various reasons it is held that  no physical object corresponds to these sensations. Thus the certainty  of our knowledge of our own experiences does not have to be limited in  any way to allow for exceptional cases. Here, therefore, we have, for  what it is worth, a solid basis from which to begin our pursuit of  knowledge.    The problem we have to consider is this: Granted that we are certain of  our own sense-data, have we any reason for regarding them as signs of  the existence of something else, which we can call the physical object?  When we have enumerated all the sense-data which we should naturally  regard as connected with the table, have we said all there is to say  about the table, or is there still something else--something not a  sense-datum, something which persists when we go out of the room? Common  sense unhesitatingly answers that there is. What can be bought and sold  and pushed about and have a cloth laid on it, and so on, cannot be  a _mere_ collection of sense-data. If the cloth completely hides the  table, we shall derive no sense-data from the table, and therefore, if  the table were merely sense-data, it would have ceased to exist, and  the cloth would be suspended in empty air, resting, by a miracle, in  the place where the table formerly was. This seems plainly absurd; but  whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened  by absurdities.    One great reason why it is felt that we must secure a physical object  in addition to the sense-data, is that we want the same object for  different people. When ten people are sitting round a dinner-table,  it seems preposterous to maintain that they are not seeing the same  tablecloth, the same knives and forks and spoons and glasses. But the  sense-data are private to each separate person; what is immediately  present to the sight of one is not immediately present to the sight of  another: they all see things from slightly different points of view, and  therefore see them slightly differently. Thus, if there are to be public  neutral objects, which can be in some sense known to many different  people, there must be something over and above the private and  particular sense-data which appear to various people. What reason, then,  have we for believing that there are such public neutral objects?    The first answer that naturally occurs to one is that, although  different people may see the table slightly differently, still they all  see more or less similar things when they look at the table, and  the variations in what they see follow the laws of perspective and  reflection of light, so that it is easy to arrive at a permanent object  underlying all the different people's sense-data. I bought my table from  the former occupant of my room; I could not buy _his_ sense-data,  which died when he went away, but I could and did buy the confident  expectation of more or less similar sense-data. Thus it is the fact that  different people have similar sense-data, and that one person in a given  place at different times has similar sense-data, which makes us suppose  that over and above the sense-data there is a permanent public object  which underlies or causes the sense-data of various people at various  times.    Now in so far as the above considerations depend upon supposing that  there are other people besides ourselves, they beg the very question at  issue. Other people are represented to me by certain sense-data, such as  the sight of them or the sound of their voices, and if I had no  reason to believe that there were physical objects independent of my  sense-data, I should have no reason to believe that other people exist  except as part of my dream. Thus, when we are trying to show that there  must be objects independent of our own sense-data, we cannot appeal to  the testimony of other people, since this testimony itself consists of  sense-data, and does not reveal other people's experiences unless our  own sense-data are signs of things existing independently of us. We must  therefore, if possible, find, in our own purely private experiences,  characteristics which show, or tend to show, that there are in the world  things other than ourselves and our private experiences.    In one sense it must be admitted that we can never prove the existence  of things other than ourselves and our experiences. No logical absurdity  results from the hypothesis that the world consists of myself and my  thoughts and feelings and sensations, and that everything else is mere  fancy. In dreams a very complicated world may seem to be present, and  yet on waking we find it was a delusion; that is to say, we find that  the sense-data in the dream do not appear to have corresponded with such  physical objects as we should naturally infer from our sense-data. (It  is true that, when the physical world is assumed, it is possible to  find physical causes for the sense-data in dreams: a door banging, for  instance, may cause us to dream of a naval engagement. But although, in  this case, there is a physical cause for the sense-data, there is not a  physical object corresponding to the sense-data in the way in which an  actual naval battle would correspond.) There is no logical impossibility  in the supposition that the whole of life is a dream, in which we  ourselves create all the objects that come before us. But although this  is not logically impossible, there is no reason whatever to suppose that  it is true; and it is, in fact, a less simple hypothesis, viewed as a  means of accounting for the facts of our own life, than the common-sense  hypothesis that there really are objects independent of us, whose action  on us causes our sensations.    The way in which simplicity comes in from supposing that there really  are physical objects is easily seen. If the cat appears at one moment in  one part of the room, and at another in another part, it is natural  to suppose that it has moved from the one to the other, passing over  a series of intermediate positions. But if it is merely a set of  sense-data, it cannot have ever been in any place where I did not see  it; thus we shall have to suppose that it did not exist at all while I  was not looking, but suddenly sprang into being in a new place. If  the cat exists whether I see it or not, we can understand from our own  experience how it gets hungry between one meal and the next; but if  it does not exist when I am not seeing it, it seems odd that appetite  should grow during non-existence as fast as during existence. And if the  cat consists only of sense-data, it cannot be hungry, since no hunger  but my own can be a sense-datum to me. Thus the behaviour of the  sense-data which represent the cat to me, though it seems quite natural  when regarded as an expression of hunger, becomes utterly inexplicable  when regarded as mere movements and changes of patches of colour, which  are as incapable of hunger as a triangle is of playing football.    But the difficulty in the case of the cat is nothing compared to the  difficulty in the case of human beings. When human beings speak--that  is, when we hear certain noises which we associate with ideas, and  simultaneously see certain motions of lips and expressions of face--it  is very difficult to suppose that what we hear is not the expression  of a thought, as we know it would be if we emitted the same sounds. Of  course similar things happen in dreams, where we are mistaken as to the  existence of other people. But dreams are more or less suggested by what  we call waking life, and are capable of being more or less accounted for  on scientific principles if we assume that there really is a physical  world. Thus every principle of simplicity urges us to adopt the natural  view, that there really are objects other than ourselves and our  sense-data which have an existence not dependent upon our perceiving  them.    Of course it is not by argument that we originally come by our belief in  an independent external world. We find this belief ready in ourselves as  soon as we begin to reflect: it is what may be"]]]
