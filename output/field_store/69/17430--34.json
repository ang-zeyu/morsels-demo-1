Besides, can't you see what I mean? I couldn't trade on a chance  acquaintance of the golf links to--'    'That is just what I complain of in you. You're too diffident.'    'It isn't diffidence exactly. Talking of old Nutcombe, I was  speaking to Gates again the other night. He was telling me about  America. There's a lot of money to be made over there, you know,  and the committee owes me a holiday. They would give me a few  weeks off any time I liked.    'What do you say? Shall I pop over and have a look round? I might  happen to drop into something. Gates was telling me about fellows  he knew who had dropped into things in New York.'    'What's the good of putting yourself to all the trouble and  expense of going to America? You can easily make all you want in  London if you will only try. It isn't as if you had no chances.  You have more chances than almost any man in town. With your title  you could get all the directorships in the City that you wanted.'    'Well, the fact is, this business of taking directorships has  never quite appealed to me. I don't know anything about the game,  and I should probably run up against some wildcat company. I can't  say I like the directorship wheeze much. It's the idea of knowing  that one's name would be being used as a bait. Every time I saw it  on a prospectus I should feel like a trout fly.'    Claire bit her lip.    'It's so exasperating!' she broke out. 'When I first told my  friends that I was engaged to Lord Dawlish they were tremendously  impressed. They took it for granted that you must have lots of  money. Now I have to keep explaining to them that the reason we  don't get married is that we can't afford to. I'm almost as badly  off as poor Polly Davis who was in the Heavenly Waltz Company with  me when she married that man, Lord Wetherby. A man with a title  has no right not to have money. It makes the whole thing farcical.    'If I were in your place I should have tried a hundred things by  now, but you always have some silly objection. Why couldn't you,  for instance, have taken on the agency of that what-d'you-call-it  car?'    'What I called it would have been nothing to what the poor devils  who bought it would have called it.'    'You could have sold hundreds of them, and the company would have  given you any commission you asked. You know just the sort of  people they wanted to get in touch with.'    'But, darling, how could I? Planting Breitstein on the club would  have been nothing compared with sowing these horrors about London.  I couldn't go about the place sticking my pals with a car which, I  give you my honest word, was stuck together with chewing-gum and  tied up with string.'    'Why not? It would be their fault if they bought a car that wasn't  any good. Why should you have to worry once you had it sold?'    It was not Lord Dawlish's lucky afternoon. All through lunch he  had been saying the wrong thing, and now he put the coping-stone  on his misdeeds. Of all the ways in which he could have answered  Claire's question he chose the worst.    'Er--well,' he said, '_noblesse oblige_, don't you know, what?'    For a moment Claire did not speak. Then she looked at her watch  and got up.    'I must be going,' she said, coldly.    'But you haven't had your coffee yet.'    'I don't want any coffee.'    'What's the matter, dear?'    'Nothing is the matter. I have to go home and pack. I'm going to  Southampton this afternoon.'    She began to move towards the door. Lord Dawlish, anxious to  follow, was detained by the fact that he had not yet paid the  bill. The production and settling of this took time, and when  finally he turned in search of Claire she was nowhere visible.    Bounding upstairs on the swift feet of love, he reached the  street. She had gone.          2      A grey sadness surged over Bill Dawlish. The sun hid itself behind  a cloud, the sky took on a leaden hue, and a chill wind blew  through the world. He scanned Shaftesbury Avenue with a jaundiced  eye, and thought that he had never seen a beastlier thoroughfare.  Piccadilly, however, into which he shortly dragged himself, was  even worse. It was full of men and women and other depressing  things.    He pitied himself profoundly. It was a rotten world to live in,  this, where a fellow couldn't say _noblesse oblige_ without  upsetting the universe. Why shouldn't a fellow say _noblesse  oblige?_ Why--? At this juncture Lord Dawlish walked into a  lamp-post.    The shock changed his mood. Gloom still obsessed him, but blended  now with remorse. He began to look at the matter from Claire's  viewpoint, and his pity switched from himself to her. In the first  place, the poor girl had rather a rotten time. Could she be blamed  for wanting him to make money? No. Yet whenever she made suggestions  as to how the thing was to be done, he snubbed her by saying  _noblesse oblige_. Naturally a refined and sensitive young girl  objected to having things like _noblesse oblige_ said to her. Where  was the sense in saying _noblesse oblige_? Such a confoundedly silly  thing to say. Only a perfect ass would spend his time rushing about  the place saying _noblesse oblige_ to people.    'By Jove!' Lord Dawlish stopped in his stride. He disentangled  himself from a pedestrian who had rammed him on the back. 'I'll do  it!'    He hailed a passing taxi and directed the driver to make for the  Pen and Ink Club.    The decision at which Bill had arrived with such dramatic  suddenness in the middle of Piccadilly was the same at which some  centuries earlier Columbus had arrived in the privacy of his home.    'Hang it!' said Bill to himself in the cab, 'I'll go to America!'  The exact words probably which Columbus had used, talking the  thing over with his wife.    Bill's knowledge of the great republic across the sea was at this  period of his life a little sketchy. He knew that there had been  unpleasantness between England and the United States in  seventeen-something and again in eighteen-something, but that  things had eventually been straightened out by Miss Edna May  and her fellow missionaries of the Belle of New York Company,  since which time there had been no more trouble. Of American  cocktails he had a fair working knowledge, and he appreciated  ragtime. But of the other great American institutions he was  completely ignorant.    He was on his way now to see Gates. Gates was a comparatively  recent addition to his list of friends, a New York newspaperman  who had come to England a few months before to act as his paper's  London correspondent. He was generally to be found at the Pen and  Ink Club, an institution affiliated with the New York Players, of  which he was a member.    Gates was in. He had just finished lunch.    'What's the trouble, Bill?' he inquired, when he had deposited his  lordship in a corner of the reading-room, which he had selected  because silence was compulsory there, thus rendering it possible  for two men to hear each other speak. 'What brings you charging in  here looking like the Soul's Awakening?'    'I've had an idea, old man.'    'Proceed. Continue.'    'Oh! Well, you remember what you were saying about America?'    'What was I saying about America?'    'The other day, don't you remember? What a lot of money there was  to be made there and so forth.'    'Well?'    'I'm going there.'    'To America?'    'Yes.'    'To make money?'    'Rather.'    Gates nodded--sadly, it seemed to Bill. He was rather a melancholy  young man, with a long face not unlike a pessimistic horse.    'Gosh!' he said.    Bill felt a little damped. By no mental juggling could he construe  'Gosh!' into an expression of enthusiastic approbation.    Gates looked at Bill curiously. 'What's the idea?' he said. 'I  could have understood it if you had told me that you were going to  New York for pleasure, instructing your man Willoughby to see that  the trunks were jolly well packed and wiring to the skipper of  your yacht to meet you at Liverpool. But you seem to have sordid  motives. You talk about making money. What do you want with more  money?'    'Why, I'm devilish hard up.'    'Tenantry a bit slack with the rent?' said Gates sympathetically.    Bill laughed.    'My dear chap, I don't know what on earth you're talking about.  How much money do you think I've got? Four hundred pounds a year,  and no prospect of ever making more unless I sweat for it.'    'What! I always thought you were rolling in money.'    'What gave you that idea?'    'You have a prosperous look. It's a funny thing about England.  I've known you four months, and I know men who know you; but I've  never heard a word about your finances. In New York we all wear  labels, stating our incomes and prospects in clear lettering.  Well, if it's like that it's different, of course. There certainly  is more money to be made in America than here. I don't quite see  what you think you're going to do when you get there, but that's  up to you.    'There's no harm in giving the city a trial. Anyway, I can give  you a letter or two that might help.'    'That's awfully good of you.'    'You won't mind my alluding to you as my friend William Smith?'    'William Smith?'    'You can't travel under your own name if you are really serious  about getting a job. Mind you, if my letters lead to anything it  will probably be a situation as an earnest bill-clerk or an  effervescent office-boy, for Rockefeller and Carnegie and that lot  have swiped all the soft jobs. But if you go over as Lord Dawlish  you won't even get that. Lords are popular socially in America,  but are not used to any great extent in the office. If you try to  break in under your right name you'll get the glad hand and be  asked to stay here and there and play a good deal of golf and  dance quite a lot, but you won't get a job.

The crows  mostly build their nests on the tops of the cocoa-nut palms and drink  incessantly out of the open pumpkins. The result of this is the chronic  intoxication of the birds. As soon as we went out in the garden of our  new habitation, flocks of crows came down heavily from every tree. The  noise they make whilst jumping about everywhere is indescribable. There  seemed to be something positively human in the positions of the slyly  bent heads of the drunken birds, and a fiendish light shone in their  eyes while they were examining us from foot to head.        We occupied three small bungalows, lost, like nests, in the garden,  their roofs literally smothered in roses blossoming on bushes twenty  feet high, and their windows covered only with muslin, instead of the  usual panes of glass. The bungalows were situated in the native part of  the town, so that we were transported, all at once, into the real India.  We were living in India, unlike English people, who are only surrounded  by India at a certain distance. We were enabled to study her character  and customs, her religion, superstitions and rites, to learn her  legends, in fact, to live among Hindus.    Everything in India, this land of the elephant and the poisonous cobra,  of the tiger and the unsuccessful English missionary, is original and  strange. Everything seems unusual, unexpected, and striking, even to one  who has travelled in Turkey, Egypt, Damascus, and Palestine. In these  tropical regions the conditions of nature are so various that all the  forms of the animal and vegetable kingdoms must radically differ from  what we are used to in Europe. Look, for instance, at those women on  their way to a well through a garden, which is private and at the same  time open to anyone, because somebody's cows are grazing in it. To whom  does it not happen to meet with women, to see cows, and admire a garden?  Doubtless these are among the commonest of all things. But a single  attentive glance will suffice to show you the difference that exists  between the same objects in Europe and in India. Nowhere more than  in India does a human being feel his weakness and insignificance. The  majesty of the tropical growth is such that our highest trees would look  dwarfed compared with banyans and especially with palms. A European cow,  mistaking, at first sight, her Indian sister for a calf, would deny the  existence of any kinship between them, as neither the mouse-coloured  wool, nor the straight goat-like horns, nor the humped back of the  latter would permit her to make such an error. As to the women, each of  them would make any artist feel enthusiastic about the gracefulness  of her movements and drapery, but still, no pink and white, stout Anna  Ivanovna would condescend to greet her. \"Such a shame, God forgive me,  the woman is entirely naked!\"    This opinion of the modern Russian woman is nothing but the echo of what  was said in 1470 by a distinguished Russian traveler, \"the sinful slave  of God, Athanasius son of Nikita from Tver,\" as he styles himself. He  describes India as follows: \"This is the land of India. Its people are  naked, never cover their heads, and wear their hair braided. Women have  babies every year. Men and women are black. Their prince wears a veil  round his head and wraps another veil round his legs. The noblemen wear  a veil on one shoulder, and the noblewomen on the shoulders and round  the loins, but everyone is barefooted. The women walk about with their  hair spread and their breasts naked. The children, boys and girls, never  cover their shame until they are seven years old....\" This description  is quite correct, but Athanasius Nikita's son is right only concerning  the lowest and poorest classes. These really do \"walk about\" covered  only with a veil, which often is so poor that, in fact, it is nothing  but a rag. But still, even the poorest woman is clad in a piece of  muslin at least ten yards long. One end serves as a sort of short  petticoat, and the other covers the head and shoulders when out in the  street, though the faces are always uncovered. The hair is erected into  a kind of Greek chignon. The legs up to the knees, the arms, and the  waist are never covered. There is not a single respectable woman who  would consent to put on a pair of shoes. Shoes are the attribute and the  prerogative of disreputable women. When, some time ago, the wife of the  Madras governor thought of passing a law that should induce native  women to cover their breasts, the place was actually threatened with  a revolution. A kind of jacket is worn only by dancing girls. The  Government recognized that it would be unreasonable to irritate women,  who, very often, are more dangerous than their husbands and brothers,  and the custom, based on the law of Manu, and sanctified by three  thousand years' observance, remained unchanged.      For more than two years before we left America we were in constant  correspondence with a certain learned Brahman, whose glory is great  at present (1879) all over India. We came to India to study, under his  guidance, the ancient country of Aryas, the Vedas, and their difficult  language. His name is Dayanand Saraswati Swami. Swami is the name of the  learned anchorites who are initiated into many mysteries unattainable by  common mortals. They are monks who never marry, but are quite different  from other mendicant brotherhoods, the so-called Sannyasi and Hossein.  This Pandit is considered the greatest Sanskritist of modern India  and is an absolute enigma to everyone. It is only five years since  he appeared on the arena of great reforms, but till then, he lived,  entirely secluded, in a jungle, like the ancient gymnosophists mentioned  by the Greek and Latin authors. At this time he was studying the chief  philosophical systems of the \"Aryavartta\" and the occult meaning of the  Vedas with the help of mystics and anchorites. All Hindus believe that  on the Bhadrinath Mountains (22,000 feet above the level of the sea)  there exist spacious caves, inhabited, now for many thousand years, by  these anchorites. Bhadrinath is situated in the north of Hindustan on  the river Bishegunj, and is celebrated for its temple of Vishnu right in  the heart of the town. Inside the temple there are hot mineral springs,  visited yearly by about fifty thousand pilgrims, who come to be purified  by them.    From the first day of his appearance Dayanand Saraswati produced  an immense impression and got the surname of the \"Luther of India.\"  Wandering from one town to another, today in the South, tomorrow in the  North, and transporting himself from one end of the country to another  with incredible quickness, he has visited every part of India, from Cape  Comorin to the Himalayas, and from Calcutta to Bombay. He preaches the  One Deity and, \"Vedas in hand,\" proves that in the ancient writings  there was not a word that could justify polytheism. Thundering against  idol worship, the great orator fights with all his might against caste,  infant marriages, and superstitions. Chastising all the evils grafted on  India by centuries of casuistry and false interpretation of the Vedas,  he blames for them the Brahmans, who, as he openly says before masses of  people, are alone guilty of the humiliation of their country, once great  and independent, now fallen and enslaved. And yet Great Britain has in  him not an enemy, but rather an ally. He says openly--\"If you expel the  English, then, no later than tomorrow, you and I and everyone who rises  against idol worship will have our throats cut like mere sheep. The  Mussulmans are stronger than the idol worshippers; but these last  are stronger than we.\" The Pandit held many a warm dispute with the  Brah-mans, those treacherous enemies of the people, and has almost  always been victorious. In Benares secret assassins were hired to slay  him, but the attempt did not succeed. In a small town of Bengal, where  he treated fetishism with more than his usual severity, some fanatic  threw on his naked feet a huge cobra. There are two snakes deified by  the Brahman mythology: the one which surrounds the neck of Shiva on his  idols is called Vasuki; the other, Ananta, forms the couch of Vishnu. So  the worshipper of Shiva, feeling sure that his cobra, trained purposely  for the mysteries of a Shivaite pagoda, would at once make an end of  the offender's life, triumphantly exclaimed, \"Let the god Vasuki himself  show which of us is right!\"    Dayanand jerked off the cobra twirling round his leg, and with a single  vigorous movement, crushed the reptile's head. \"Let him do so,\" he  quietly assented. \"Your god has been too slow. It is I who have decided  the dispute, Now go,\" added he, addressing the crowd, \"and tell everyone  how easily perish the false gods.\"    Thanks to his excellent knowledge of Sanskrit the Pandit does a great  service, not only to the masses, clearing their ignorance about the  monotheism of the Vedas, but to science too, showing who, exactly, are  the Brahmans, the only caste in India which, during centuries, had the  right to study Sanskrit literature and comment on the Vedas, and which  used this right solely for its own advantage.    Long before the time of such Orientalists as Burnouf, Colebrooke and Max  Muller, there have been in India many reformers who tried to prove the  pure monotheism of the Vedic doctrines. There have even been founders  of new religions who denied the revelations of these scriptures; for  instance, the Raja Ram Mohun Roy, and, after him, Babu Keshub Chunder  Sen, both Calcutta Bengalees. But neither of them had much success. They  did nothing but add new denominations to the numberless sects existing  in India. Ram Mohun Roy died in England, having done next to nothing,  and"]]]
