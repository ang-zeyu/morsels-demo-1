There is also another consideration not to be lost sight of. A people  may be unprepared for good institutions; but to kindle a desire for  them is a necessary part of the preparation. To recommend and advocate  a particular institution or form of government, and set its advantages  in the strongest light, is one of the modes, often the only mode  within reach, of educating the mind of the nation not only for  accepting or claiming, but also for working, the institution. What  means had Italian patriots, during the last and present generation, of  preparing the Italian people for freedom in unity, but by inciting  them to demand it? Those, however, who undertake such a task, need to  be duly impressed, not solely with the benefits of the institution or  polity which they recommend, but also with the capacities, moral,  intellectual, and active, required for working it; that they may  avoid, if possible, stirring up a desire too much in advance of the  capacity.    The result of what has been said is, that, within the limits set by  the three conditions so often adverted to, institutions and forms of  government are a matter of choice. To inquire into the best form of  government in the abstract (as it is called) is not a chimerical, but  a highly practical employment of scientific intellect; and to  introduce into any country the best institutions which, in the  existing state of that country, are capable of, in any tolerable  degree, fulfilling the conditions, is one of the most rational  objects to which practical effort can address itself. Every thing  which can be said by way of disparaging the efficacy of human will and  purpose in matters of government might be said of it in every other of  its applications. In all things there are very strict limits to human  power. It can only act by wielding some one or more of the forces of  nature. Forces, therefore, that can be applied to the desired use must  exist; and will only act according to their own laws. We can not make  the river run backwards; but we do not therefore say that watermills  \"are not made, but grow.\" In politics, as in mechanics, the power  which is to keep the engine going must be sought for _outside_ the  machinery; and if it is not forthcoming, or is insufficient to  surmount the obstacles which may reasonably be expected, the  contrivance will fail. This is no peculiarity of the political art;  and amounts only to saying that it is subject to the same limitations  and conditions as all other arts.    At this point we are met by another objection, or the same objection  in a different form. The forces, it is contended, on which the greater  political phenomena depend, are not amenable to the direction of  politicians or philosophers. The government of a country, it is  affirmed, is, in all substantial respects, fixed and determined  beforehand by the state of the country in regard to the distribution  of the elements of social power. Whatever is the strongest power in  society will obtain the governing authority; and a change in the  political constitution can not be durable unless preceded or  accompanied by an altered distribution of power in society itself. A  nation, therefore, can not choose its form of government. The mere  details, and practical organization, it may choose; but the essence of  the whole, the seat of the supreme power, is determined for it by  social circumstances.    That there is a portion of truth in this doctrine I at once admit; but  to make it of any use, it must be reduced to a distinct expression and  proper limits. When it is said that the strongest power in society  will make itself strongest in the government, what is meant by power?  Not thews and sinews; otherwise pure democracy would be the only form  of polity that could exist. To mere muscular strength, add two other  elements, property and intelligence, and we are nearer the truth, but  far from having yet reached it. Not only is a greater number often  kept down by a less, but the greater number may have a preponderance  in property, and individually in intelligence, and may yet be held in  subjection, forcibly or otherwise, by a minority in both respects  inferior to it. To make these various elements of power politically  influential they must be organized; and the advantage in organization  is necessarily with those who are in possession of the government. A  much weaker party in all other elements of power may greatly  preponderate when the powers of government are thrown into the scale;  and may long retain its predominance through this alone: though, no  doubt, a government so situated is in the condition called in  mechanics unstable equilibrium, like a thing balanced on its smaller  end, which, if once disturbed, tends more and more to depart from,  instead of reverting to, its previous state.    But there are still stronger objections to this theory of government  in the terms in which it is usually stated. The power in society which  has any tendency to convert itself into political power is not power  quiescent, power merely passive, but active power; in other words,  power actually exerted; that is to say, a very small portion of all  the power in existence. Politically speaking, a great part of all  power consists in will. How is it possible, then, to compute the  elements of political power, while we omit from the computation any  thing which acts on the will? To think that, because those who wield  the power in society wield in the end that of government, therefore it  is of no use to attempt to influence the constitution of the  government by acting on opinion, is to forget that opinion is itself  one of the greatest active social forces. One person with a belief is  a social power equal to ninety-nine who have only interests. They who  can succeed in creating a general persuasion that a certain form of  government, or social fact of any kind, deserves to be preferred, have  made nearly the most important step which can possibly be taken toward  ranging the powers of society on its side. On the day when the  protomartyr was stoned to death at Jerusalem, while he who was to be  the Apostle of the Gentiles stood by \"consenting unto his death,\"  would any one have supposed that the party of that stoned man were  then and there the strongest power in society? And has not the event  proved that they were so? Because theirs was the most powerful of then  existing beliefs. The same element made a monk of Wittenberg, at the  meeting of the Diet of Worms, a more powerful social force than the  Emperor Charles the Fifth, and all the princes there assembled. But  these, it may be said, are cases in which religion was concerned, and  religious convictions are something peculiar in their strength. Then  let us take a case purely political, where religion, if concerned at  all, was chiefly on the losing side. If any one requires to be  convinced that speculative thought is one of the chief elements of  social power, let him bethink himself of the age in which there was  scarcely a throne in Europe which was not filled by a liberal and  reforming king, a liberal and reforming emperor, or, strangest of all,  a liberal and reforming pope; the age of Frederic the Great, of  Catherine the Second, of Joseph the Second, of Peter Leopold, of  Benedict XIV., of Ganganelli, of Pombal, of D'Aranda; when the very  Bourbons of Naples were liberals and reformers, and all the active  minds among the noblesse of France were filled with the ideas which  were soon after to cost them so dear. Surely a conclusive example how  far mere physical and economic power is from being the whole of social  power. It was not by any change in the distribution of material  interests, but by the spread of moral convictions, that negro slavery  has been put an end to in the British Empire and elsewhere. The serfs  in Russia owe their emancipation, if not to a sentiment of duty, at  least to the growth of a more enlightened opinion respecting the true  interest of the state. It is what men think that determines how they  act; and though the persuasions and convictions of average men are in  a much greater degree determined by their personal position than by  reason, no little power is exercised over them by the persuasions and  convictions of those whose personal position is different, and by the  united authority of the instructed. When, therefore, the instructed in  general can be brought to recognize one social arrangement, or  political or other institution, as good, and another as bad--one as  desirable, another as condemnable, very much has been done towards  giving to the one, or withdrawing from the other, that preponderance  of social force which enables it to subsist. And the maxim, that the  government of a country is what the social forces in existence compel  it to be, is true only in the sense in which it favors, instead of  discouraging, the attempt to exercise, among all forms of government  practicable in the existing condition of society, a rational choice.        Chapter II--The Criterion of a Good Form of Government.      The form of government for any given country being (within certain  definite conditions) amenable to choice, it is now to be considered by  what test the choice should be directed; what are the distinctive  characteristics of the form of government best fitted to promote the  interests of any given society.    Before entering into this inquiry, it may seem necessary to decide  what are the proper functions of government; for, government  altogether being only a means, the eligibility of the means must  depend on their adaptation to the end. But this mode of stating the  problem gives less aid to its investigation than might be supposed,  and does not even bring the whole of the question into view. For, in  the first place, the proper"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5694"],[0,"The Harvard Classics Volume 38 (#3)"],[1,"s, falcons, arquebuses; in brief, all who came together  were well equipped with all sorts and kinds of artillery, and  with many soldiers, both Breton and French, to hinder the English  from landing as they had resolved at their parting from England.    The enemy's army came right under our cannons: and when we  perceived them desiring to land, we saluted them with cannon-  shot, and unmasked our forces and our artillery. They fled to sea  again. I was right glad to see their ships set sail, which were  in good number and good order, and seemed to be a forest moving  upon the sea. I saw a thing also whereat I marvelled much, which  was, that the balls of the great cannons made long rebounds, and  grazed over the water as they do over the earth. Now to make the  matter short, our English did us no harm, and returned safe and  sound into England. And they leaving us in peace, we stayed in  that country in garrison until we were assured that their army  was dispersed.    Now our soldiers used often to exercise themselves with running  at the ring, or with fencing, so that there was always some one  in trouble, and I had always something to employ me. M.  d'Estampes, to make pastime and pleasure for the Seigneurs de  Rohan and de Laval, and other gentlemen, got a number of village  girls to come to the sports, to sing songs in the tongue of Low  Brittany: wherein their harmony was like the croaking of frogs  when they are in love. Moreover, he made them dance the Brittany  triori, without moving feet or hips: he made the gentlemen see  and hear many good things.    At other tunes they made the wrestlers of the towns and Villages  come, where there was a prize for the best: and the sport was not  ended but that one or other had a leg or arm broken, or the  shoulder or hip dislocated.    There was a little man of Low Brittany, of a square body and well  set, who long held the credit of the field, and by his skill and  strength threw five or six to the ground. There came against him  a big man, one Dativo, a pedagogue, who was said to be one of the  best wrestlers in all Brittany: he entered into the lists, having  thrown off his long jacket, in hose and doublet: when he was near  the little man, it looked as though the little man had been tied  to his girdle. Nevertheless, when they gripped each other round  the neck, they were a long time without doing anything, and we  thought they would remain equal in force and skill: but the  little man suddenly leaped beneath this big Dativo, and took him  on his shoulder, and threw him to earth on his back all spread  out like a frog; and all the company laughed at the skill and  strength of the little fellow. The great Dativo was furious to  have been thus thrown to earth by so small a man: he rose again  in a rage, and would have his revenge. They took hold again round  the neck, and were again a good while at their hold without  falling to the ground: but at last the big man let himself fall  upon the little, and in falling put his elbow upon the pit of his  stomach, and burst his heart, and killed him stark dead. And  knowing he had given him his death's blow, took again his long  cassock, and went away with his tail between his legs, and  eclipsed himself. Seeing the little man came not again to  himself, either for wine, vinegar, or any other thing presented  to him, I drew near to him and felt his pulse, which did not beat  at all: then I said he was dead. Then the Bretons, who were  assisting at the wrestling, said aloud in their jargon, \"Andraze  meuraquet enes rac un bloa so abeuduex henelep e barz an gouremon  enel ma hoa engoustun.\" That is to say, \"That is not in the  sport.\" And someone said that this great Dativo was accustomed to  do so, and but a year past he had done the same at a wrestling. I  must needs open the body to know the cause of this sudden death.  I found much blood in the thorax. ... I tried to find some  internal opening whence it might have come, which I could not,  for all the diligence that I could use. ... The poor little  wrestler was buried. I took leave of MM. de Rohan, de Laval, and  d'Estampes. M. de Rohan made me a present of fifty double ducats  and a horse, M. de Laval gave me a nag for my man, and M.  d'Estampes gave me a diamond worth thirty crowns: and I returned  to my house in Paris.          THE JOURNEY TO PERPIGNAN. 1543      Some while after, M. de Rohan took me with him posting to the  camp at Perpignan. While we were there, the enemy sallied out,  and surrounded three pieces of our artillery before they were  beaten back to the gates of the city. Which was not done without  many killed and wounded, among the others M. de Brissac, who was  then grand master of the artillery, with an arquebus-shot in the  shoulder. When he retired to his tent, all the wounded followed  him, hoping to be dressed by the surgeons who were to dress him.  Being come to his tent and laid on his bed, the bullet was  searched for by three or four of the best surgeons in the army,  who could not find it, but said it had entered into his body.    At last he called for me, to see if I could be more skilful than  they, because he had known me in Piedmont. Then I made him rise  from his bed, and told him to put himself in the same posture  that he had when he was wounded, which he did, taking a javelin  in his hand just as he had held his pike to fight. I put my hand  around the wound, and found the bullet. ... Having found it, I  showed them the place where it was, and it was taken out by M.  Nicole Lavernot, surgeon of M. the Dauphin, who was the King's  Lieutenant in that army; all the same, the honour of finding it  belonged to me.    I saw one very strange thing, which was this: a soldier in my  presence gave one of his fellows a blow on the head with a  halbard, penetrating to the left ventricle of the brain; yet the  man did not fall to the ground. He that struck him said he heard  that he had cheated at dice, and he had drawn a large sum of  money from him, and was accustomed to cheat. They called me to  dress him; which I did, as it were for the last time, knowing  that he would die soon. When I had dressed him, he returned all  alone to his quarters, which were at the least two hundred paces  away. I bade one of his companions send for a priest to dispose  the affairs of his soul; he got one for him, who stayed with him  to his last breath. The next day, the patient sent for me by his  girl, dressed in boy's apparel, to come and dress him; which I  would not, fearing he would die under my hands; and to be rid of  the matter I told her the dressing must not be removed before the  third day. But in truth he was sure to die, though he were never  touched again. The third day, he came staggering to find me in my  tent, and the girl with him, and prayed me most affectionately to  dress him, and showed me a purse wherein might be an hundred or  sixscore pieces of gold, and said he would give me my heart's  desire; nevertheless, for all that, I put off the removal of the  dressing, fearing lest he should die then and there. Certain  gentlemen desired me to go and dress him; which I did at their  request; but in dressing him he died under my hands in a  convulsion. The priest stayed with him till death, and seized his  purse, for fear another man should take it, saying he would say  masses for his poor soul. Also he took his clothes, and  everything else.    I have told this case for the wonder of it, that the soldier,  having received this great blow, did not fall down, and kept his  reason to the end.    Not long afterward, the camp was broken up from diverse causes:  one, because we were told that four companies of Spaniards were  entered into Perpignan: the other, that the plague was spreading  through the camp. Moreover, the country folk warned us there  would soon be a great overflowing of the sea, which might drown  us all. And the presage which they had, was a very great wind  from sea, which rose so high that there remained not a single  tent but was broken and thrown down, for all the care and  diligence we could give; and the kitchens being all uncovered,  the wind raised the dust and sand, which salted and powdered our  meats in such fashion that we could not eat them; and we had to  cook them in pots and other covered vessels. Nor was the camp so  quickly moved but that many carts and carters, mules and mule  drivers, were drowned in the sea, with great loss of baggage.    When the camp was moved I returned to Paris.          THE JOURNEY TO LANDRESY. 1544      The King raised a great army to victual Landresy. Against him the  Emperor had no fewer men, but many more, to wit, eighteen  thousand Germans, ten thousand Spaniards, six thousand Walloons,  ten thousand English, and from thirteen to fourteen thousand  horse. I saw the two armies near each other, within cannon-shot;  and we thought they could not withdraw without giving battle.  There were some foolish gentlemen who must needs approach the  enemy's camp; the enemy fired on them with light field pieces;  some died then and there, others had their arms or legs carried  away. The King having done what he wished, which was to victual  Landresy, withdrew his army to Guise, which was the day after All  Saints, 1544; and from there I returned to Paris.    A little while after, we went to Boulogne; where the English,  seeing our army, left the forts which they were holding,  Moulanabert, le petit Paradis, Monplaisir, the fort of  Chastillon, le Portet, the fort of Dardelot. One day, as I was  going through the camp to dress my wounded men, the enemy who  were in the Tour d' Ordre fired a cannon against us, thinking to  kill two men-at-arms who had stopped to talk together. It  happened that the ball passed quite close to one of them, which  threw him to the ground, and it was thought the ball had touched  him, which it did not; but only the wind of the ball full against  his corselet,"]]]
