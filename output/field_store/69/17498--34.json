But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and             buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.    10:005:001 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and             spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.    10:005:002 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he             that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said             to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a             captain over Israel.    10:005:003 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and             king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD:             and they anointed David king over Israel.    10:005:004 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he             reigned forty years.    10:005:005 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months:             and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all             Israel and Judah.    10:005:006 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites,             the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying,             Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not             come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.    10:005:007 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is             the city of David.    10:005:008 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the             gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind             that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain.             Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come             into the house.    10:005:009 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David.             And David built round about from Millo and inward.    10:005:010 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts             was with him.    10:005:011 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar             trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an             house.    10:005:012 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king             over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his             people Israel's sake.    10:005:013 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,             after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and             daughters born to David.    10:005:014 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in             Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,    10:005:015 Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,    10:005:016 And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.    10:005:017 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David             king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David;             and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.    10:005:018 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley             of Rephaim.    10:005:019 And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the             Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the             LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the             Philistines into thine hand.    10:005:020 And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and             said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me,             as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that             place Baalperazim.    10:005:021 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned             them.    10:005:022 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves             in the valley of Rephaim.    10:005:023 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not             go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them             over against the mulberry trees.    10:005:024 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the             tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir             thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite             the host of the Philistines.    10:005:025 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the             Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.    10:006:001 Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,             thirty thousand.    10:006:002 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with             him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of             God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts             that dwelleth between the cherubims.    10:006:003 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it             out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and             Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.    10:006:004 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at             Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the             ark.    10:006:005 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD             on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps,             and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on             cymbals.    10:006:006 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth             his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen             shook it.    10:006:007 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God             smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of             God.    10:006:008 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach             upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to             this day.    10:006:009 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall             the ark of the LORD come to me?    10:006:010 So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into             the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house             of Obededom the Gittite.    10:006:011 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the             Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all             his household.    10:006:012 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the             house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because             of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God             from the house of Obededom into the city of David with             gladness.    10:006:013 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD             had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.    10:006:014 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David             was girded with a linen ephod.    10:006:015 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the             LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.    10:006:016 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal             Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David             leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in             her heart.    10:006:017 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his             place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched             for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings             before the LORD.    10:006:018 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt             offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the             name of the LORD of hosts.    10:006:019 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole             multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one             a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of             wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.    10:006:020 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the             daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How             glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself             to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of             the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!    10:006:021 And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which             chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to             appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel:             therefore will I play before the LORD.    10:006:022 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in             mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken             of, of them shall I be had in honour.    10:006:023 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the             day of her death.    10:007:001 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the             LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;    10:007:002 That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell             in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within             curtains.    10:007:003"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8018"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 18: Job (#3)"],[1,"ions:    18:007:015 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my             life.    18:007:016 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days             are vanity.    18:007:017 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou             shouldest set thine heart upon him?    18:007:018 And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him             every moment?    18:007:019 How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I             swallow down my spittle?    18:007:020 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of             men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am             a burden to myself?    18:007:021 And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away             my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt             seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.    18:008:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,    18:008:002 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the             words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?    18:008:003 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert             justice?    18:008:004 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them             away for their transgression;    18:008:005 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy             supplication to the Almighty;    18:008:006 If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for             thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.    18:008:007 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should             greatly increase.    18:008:008 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare             thyself to the search of their fathers:    18:008:009 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our             days upon earth are a shadow:)    18:008:010 Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out             of their heart?    18:008:011 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without             water?    18:008:012 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it             withereth before any other herb.    18:008:013 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's             hope shall perish:    18:008:014 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a             spider's web.    18:008:015 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall             hold it fast, but it shall not endure.    18:008:016 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in             his garden.    18:008:017 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of             stones.    18:008:018 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him,             saying, I have not seen thee.    18:008:019 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall             others grow.    18:008:020 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he             help the evil doers:    18:008:021 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with             rejoicing.    18:008:022 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the             dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.    18:009:001 Then Job answered and said,    18:009:002 I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with             God?    18:009:003 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a             thousand.    18:009:004 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened             himself against him, and hath prospered?    18:009:005 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which             overturneth them in his anger.    18:009:006 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars             thereof tremble.    18:009:007 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up             the stars.    18:009:008 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the             waves of the sea.    18:009:009 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers             of the south.    18:009:010 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders             without number.    18:009:011 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but             I perceive him not.    18:009:012 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto             him, What doest thou?    18:009:013 If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop             under him.    18:009:014 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to             reason with him?    18:009:015 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I             would make supplication to my judge.    18:009:016 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not             believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.    18:009:017 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds             without cause.    18:009:018 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with             bitterness.    18:009:019 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment,             who shall set me a time to plead?    18:009:020 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I             say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.    18:009:021 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would             despise my life.    18:009:022 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the             perfect and the wicked.    18:009:023 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of             the innocent.    18:009:024 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth             the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?    18:009:025 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see             no good.    18:009:026 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that             hasteth to the prey.    18:009:027 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my             heaviness, and comfort myself:    18:009:028 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold             me innocent.    18:009:029 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?    18:009:030 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so             clean;    18:009:031 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes             shall abhor me.    18:009:032 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we             should come together in judgment.    18:009:033 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his             hand upon us both.    18:009:034 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear             terrify me:    18:009:035 Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with             me.    18:010:001 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon             myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.    18:010:002 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou             contendest with me.    18:010:003 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou             shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the             counsel of the wicked?    18:010:004 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?    18:010:005 Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,    18:010:006 That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after             my sin?    18:010:007 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can             deliver out of thine hand.    18:010:008 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round             about; yet thou dost destroy me.    18:010:009 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay;             and wilt thou bring me into dust again?    18:010:010 Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like             cheese?    18:010:011 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me             with bones and sinews.    18:010:012 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath             preserved my spirit.    18:010:013 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that             this is with thee.    18:010:014 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me             from mine iniquity.    18:010:015 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I             not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see             thou mine affliction;    18:010:016 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again             thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.    18:010:017 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine             indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.    18:010:018 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh             that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!    18:010:019 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have             been carried from the womb to the grave.    18:010:020 Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may             take comfort a little,    18:010:021 Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of             darkness and the shadow of death;    18:010:022 A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of             death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.    18:011:001 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,    18:011:002 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a             man full of talk be justified?    18:011:003 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou             mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?    18:011:004 For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in         "]]]
