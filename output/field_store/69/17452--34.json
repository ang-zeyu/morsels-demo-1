God bless you.\" \"Amen!\" was sobbed by more than a score  of voices.    Turning her eyes again upon the conductor, she interrogated him again,  \"What shall I tell your little girl when I see her? Shall I tell her  that I saw her pa on Jesus' railroad? Shall I?\"    This brought a fresh flood of tears from all present, and the conductor  knelt by her side, and, embracing her wept the reply he could not utter.  At this juncture the brakeman called out: \"H----.\" The conductor arose  and requested him to attend to his (the conductor's) duty at the station,  for he was engaged. That was a precious place. I thank God that I was a  witness to this scene, but I was sorry that at this point I was obliged  to leave the train.    We learn from this incident that out of the mouths of even babes God  hath ordained strength, and that we ought to be willing to represent the  cause of our blessed Jesus even in a railroad coach.    _The Sequel_    Brother Dosh:--I wish to relieve my heart by writing to you, and saying  that that angel visit on the cars was a blessing to me, although I did  not realize it in its fullness until some hours after. But blessed be  the Redeemer, I know now that I am His, and He is mine. I no longer  wonder why Christians are happy. Oh, my joy, my joy! The instrument of  my salvation has gone to God. I had purposed adopting her in the place  of my little daughter who is now in heaven. With this intention I took  her to C--b, and on my return trip I took her back to S--n, where she  left the cars. In consultation with my wife in regard to adopting her,  she replied, \"Yes, certainly, and immediately, too, for there is a Divine  providence in this. Oh,\" said she, \"I could never refuse to take under  my charge the instrument of my husband's salvation.\"    I made inquiry for the child at S--n and learned that in three days after  her return she died suddenly, without any apparent disease, and her happy  soul had gone to dwell with her ma, my little girl and the angels in  heaven. I was sorry to hear of her death but my sorrow is turned to joy  when I think my angel-daughter received intelligence from earth concerning  her pa, and that he is on the heavenly railway. Oh! sir, me thinks I see  her near the Redeemer. I think I hear her sing! \"I'm safe at home, and  pa and ma are coming,\" and I find myself sending back the reply: \"Yes,  my darling we are coming and will soon be there.\" Oh, my dear sir, I am  glad that I ever formed your acquaintance; may the blessing of the great  God rest upon you. Please write to me, and be assured, I would be most  happy to meet you again.    --J. M. Dosh, in _Christian Expositor_        THE YOUNG MARTYR    On the afternoon of August 9, 1853, a little Norwegian boy, named Kund  Iverson, who lived in the city of Chicago, Illinois, was going to the  pastures for his cow as light-hearted, I suppose, as boys usually are  when going to the pasture on a summer afternoon. He came at length to a  stream of water where there was a gang of idle, ill-looking, big boys;  who, when they saw Kund, came up to him; and said they wanted him to go  into Mr. Elston's garden and steal some apples.    \"No,\" said Kund promptly; \"I cannot steal, I am sure.\"    \"Well, but you've got to,\" they cried.    [Illustration: THE CRIES OF THE DROWNING CHILD GREW FAINTER AND FAINTER]      They threatened to duck him, for these wicked big boys had often frightened  little boys into robbing gardens for them. Little boys, they thought,  were less likely to get found out.    The threat did not frighten Kund, so to make their words good, they  seized him and dragged him into the river, and in spite of his cries and  struggles, plunged him in. But the heroic boy even with the water gurgling  and choking in his throat, never flinched, for he knew that God had said:  \"Thou shalt not steal,\" and God's law he had made his law; and no cursing,  or threats, or cruelty of the big boys would make him give up. Provoked  by his firmness, I suppose, they determined to see if they could conquer  him. So they ducked him again but it still was, \"No, no\"; and they kept  him under water. Was there no one near to hear his distressing cries,  and rescue the poor child from their cruel grip? No; there was none to  rescue him; and gradually the cries of the drowning child grew fainter  and fainter, and his struggles less and less, and the boy was drowned.  He could die, but would not steal.    A German boy who had stood near, much frightened by what he saw, ran  home to tell the news. The agonized parents hastened to the spot, and  all night they searched for the lifeless body of their lost darling. It  was found the next morning; and who shall describe their feelings as  they clasped the little form to their bosoms? Early piety had blossomed  in his little life. He loved his Bible and his Savior. His seat was  never vacant at Sunday school, and so intelligent, conscientious and  steadfast had he been.    Perhaps the little boy used often to think how, when he grew up, he would  like to be a preacher or a missionary, and do something for his Lord and  Master. He did not know what post he might be called to occupy, even as  a little child; and as he left home that afternoon and looked his last  look in his mother's face, he thought he was only going after his cows;  and other boys, and the neighbors, if they saw him, thought so, too. They  did not then know that instead of going to the pasture he was going to  preach one of the most powerful sermons of Bible law and Bible principles  the country ever heard. They did not know that he was going to give an  example of steadfastness of purpose and of unflinching integrity, such  as should thrill the heart of this nation with wonder and admiration.  He was then only a Norwegian boy, Kund Iverson, only thirteen years old,  but his name was soon to be reckoned with martyrs and heroes. And as the  story of his moral heroism winged its way from state to state, and city  to city, and village to village, how many mothers cried with full hearts:  \"May his spirit rest upon my boy!\" And strong men have wept over it and  exclaimed: \"God be praised for the lad!\" And rich men put their hands  into their pockets and said, \"Let us build him a monument; let his name  be perpetuated, for his memory is blessed.\" May there be a generation  of Kund Iversons, strong in their integrity, true to their Bibles ready  to die rather than do wrong.    --_The Cynosure_        A CHILD'S PRAYER ANSWERED    The following touching incident which drew tears from my eyes, was related  to me a short time since, by a dear friend who had it from an eyewitness  of the same. It occurred in the great city of New York, on one of the  coldest days in February.    A little boy about ten years old was standing before a shoe-store in  Broadway barefooted, peering through the window, and shivering with cold.    A lady riding up the street in a beautiful carriage, drawn by horses  finely caparisoned, observed the little fellow in his forlorn condition  and immediately ordered the driver to draw up and stop in front of the  store. The lady richly dressed in silk, alighted from her carriage, went  quickly to the boy, and said:    \"My little fellow why are you looking so earnestly in that window?\"    \"I was asking God to give me a pair of shoes,\" was the reply. The lady  took him by the hand and went into the store, and asked the proprietor  if he would allow one of his clerks to go and buy half a dozen pairs of  stockings for the boy. He readily assented. She then asked him if he  could give her a basin of water and a towel, and he replied: \"Certainly,\"  and quickly brought them to her.    She took the little fellow to the back part of the store, and, removing  her gloves knelt down, washed those little feet and dried them with the  towel.    [Illustration]    By this time the young man had returned with the stockings. Placing a  pair upon his feet, she purchased and gave him a pair of shoes, and tying  up the remaining pairs of stockings, gave them to him, and patting him  on the head said: \"I hope my little fellow, that you now feel more comfo  rtable.\"    As she turned to go, the astonished lad caught her hand, and looking up  in her face, with tears in his eyes answered her question with these  words: \"Are you God's wife?\"    --_Parish Register_        THE CONVERTED INFIDEL    Some two miles from the village of C. on a road that wound in among the  hills stood a great white house. It was beautifully situated upon a  gentle slope facing the south, and overlooking a most charming landscape.  Away in the distance, a mountain lifted itself against the clear blue  sky. At its base rolled a broad, deep river. Nestling down in a valley  that intervened, reposed the charming little village with its neat  cottages, white church, little red school house and one or two mansions  that told of wealth. Here and there in the distance a pond was visible;  while farm houses and humbler dwellings dotted the picture in every  direction.    Such was the home of three promising children, who for the last three  months had been constant members of the village Sunday School. The eldest  was a girl of some fourteen years. John, the second, was a bright, amiable  lad of eleven. The other the little rosy-cheeked, laughing Ella, with  her golden curls and sunny smile had just gathered the roses of her ninth  summer.    The father of these interesting children was the rich Captain Lowe. He  was a man of mark, such, in many respects as are often found in rural  districts. Strictly moral, intelligent and well read, kind-hearted and  naturally benevolent, he attracted all classes of community to himself  and wielded great influence in his town.    But, not withstanding all these excellences, Mr. Lowe was an infidel.  He ridiculed in his good-natured way, the idea of prayer, looked upon  conversion as a solemn farce, and believed the most of professing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7028"],[0,"The Clicking of Cuthbert (#3)"],[1,"the brushwood at the faces round him, and realized that eight out of  ten of those present had manuscripts of some sort concealed on their  persons, and were only waiting for an opportunity to whip them out  and start reading, he wished that he had stayed at his quiet home in  Nijni-Novgorod, where the worst thing that could happen to a fellow  was a brace of bombs coming in through the window and mixing  themselves up with his breakfast egg.    At this point in his meditations he was aware that his hostess was  looming up before him with a pale young man in horn-rimmed spectacles  at her side. There was in Mrs. Smethurst's demeanour something of the  unction of the master-of-ceremonies at the big fight who introduces the  earnest gentleman who wishes to challenge the winner.    \"Oh, Mr. Brusiloff,\" said Mrs. Smethurst, \"I do so want you to meet Mr.  Raymond Parsloe Devine, whose work I expect you know. He is one of our  younger novelists.\"    The distinguished visitor peered in a wary and defensive manner through  the shrubbery, but did not speak. Inwardly he was thinking how exactly  like Mr. Devine was to the eighty-one other younger novelists to whom  he had been introduced at various hamlets throughout the country.  Raymond Parsloe Devine bowed courteously, while Cuthbert, wedged into  his corner, glowered at him.    \"The critics,\" said Mr. Devine, \"have been kind enough to say that my  poor efforts contain a good deal of the Russian spirit. I owe much to  the great Russians. I have been greatly influenced by Sovietski.\"    Down in the forest something stirred. It was Vladimir Brusiloff's mouth  opening, as he prepared to speak. He was not a man who prattled  readily, especially in a foreign tongue. He gave the impression that  each word was excavated from his interior by some up-to-date process of  mining. He glared bleakly at Mr. Devine, and allowed three words to  drop out of him.    \"Sovietski no good!\"    He paused for a moment, set the machinery working again, and delivered  five more at the pithead.    \"I spit me of Sovietski!\"    There was a painful sensation. The lot of a popular idol is in many  ways an enviable one, but it has the drawback of uncertainty. Here  today and gone tomorrow. Until this moment Raymond Parsloe Devine's  stock had stood at something considerably over par in Wood Hills  intellectual circles, but now there was a rapid slump. Hitherto he had  been greatly admired for being influenced by Sovietski, but it appeared  now that this was not a good thing to be. It was evidently a rotten  thing to be. The law could not touch you for being influenced by  Sovietski, but there is an ethical as well as a legal code, and this it  was obvious that Raymond Parsloe Devine had transgressed. Women drew  away from him slightly, holding their skirts. Men looked at him  censoriously. Adeline Smethurst started violently, and dropped a  tea-cup. And Cuthbert Banks, doing his popular imitation of a sardine  in his corner, felt for the first time that life held something of  sunshine.    Raymond Parsloe Devine was plainly shaken, but he made an adroit  attempt to recover his lost prestige.    \"When I say I have been influenced by Sovietski, I mean, of course,  that I was once under his spell. A young writer commits many follies. I  have long since passed through that phase. The false glamour of  Sovietski has ceased to dazzle me. I now belong whole-heartedly to the  school of Nastikoff.\"    There was a reaction. People nodded at one another sympathetically.  After all, we cannot expect old heads on young shoulders, and a lapse  at the outset of one's career should not be held against one who has  eventually seen the light.    \"Nastikoff no good,\" said Vladimir Brusiloff, coldly. He paused,  listening to the machinery.    \"Nastikoff worse than Sovietski.\"    He paused again.    \"I spit me of Nastikoff!\" he said.    This time there was no doubt about it. The bottom had dropped out of  the market, and Raymond Parsloe Devine Preferred were down in the  cellar with no takers. It was clear to the entire assembled company  that they had been all wrong about Raymond Parsloe Devine. They had  allowed him to play on their innocence and sell them a pup. They had  taken him at his own valuation, and had been cheated into admiring him  as a man who amounted to something, and all the while he had belonged  to the school of Nastikoff. You never can tell. Mrs. Smethurst's guests  were well-bred, and there was consequently no violent demonstration,  but you could see by their faces what they felt. Those nearest Raymond  Parsloe jostled to get further away. Mrs. Smethurst eyed him stonily  through a raised lorgnette. One or two low hisses were heard, and over  at the other end of the room somebody opened the window in a marked  manner.    Raymond Parsloe Devine hesitated for a moment, then, realizing his  situation, turned and slunk to the door. There was an audible sigh of  relief as it closed behind him.    Vladimir Brusiloff proceeded to sum up.    \"No novelists any good except me. Sovietski--yah! Nastikoff--bah! I spit  me of zem all. No novelists anywhere any good except me. P. G.  Wodehouse and Tolstoi not bad. Not good, but not bad. No novelists any  good except me.\"    And, having uttered this dictum, he removed a slab of cake from a  near-by plate, steered it through the jungle, and began to champ.    It is too much to say that there was a dead silence. There could never  be that in any room in which Vladimir Brusiloff was eating cake. But  certainly what you might call the general chit-chat was pretty well  down and out. Nobody liked to be the first to speak. The members of the  Wood Hills Literary Society looked at one another timidly. Cuthbert,  for his part, gazed at Adeline; and Adeline gazed into space. It was  plain that the girl was deeply stirred. Her eyes were opened wide, a  faint flush crimsoned her cheeks, and her breath was coming quickly.    Adeline's mind was in a whirl. She felt as if she had been walking  gaily along a pleasant path and had stopped suddenly on the very brink  of a precipice. It would be idle to deny that Raymond Parsloe Devine  had attracted her extraordinarily. She had taken him at his own  valuation as an extremely hot potato, and her hero-worship had  gradually been turning into love. And now her hero had been shown to  have feet of clay. It was hard, I consider, on Raymond Parsloe Devine,  but that is how it goes in this world. You get a following as a  celebrity, and then you run up against another bigger celebrity and  your admirers desert you. One could moralize on this at considerable  length, but better not, perhaps. Enough to say that the glamour of  Raymond Devine ceased abruptly in that moment for Adeline, and her most  coherent thought at this juncture was the resolve, as soon as she got  up to her room, to burn the three signed photographs he had sent her  and to give the autographed presentation set of his books to the  grocer's boy.    Mrs. Smethurst, meanwhile, having rallied somewhat, was endeavouring to  set the feast of reason and flow of soul going again.    \"And how do you like England, Mr. Brusiloff?\" she asked.    The celebrity paused in the act of lowering another segment of cake.    \"Dam good,\" he replied, cordially.    \"I suppose you have travelled all over the country by this time?\"    \"You said it,\" agreed the Thinker.    \"Have you met many of our great public men?\"    \"Yais--Yais--Quite a few of the nibs--Lloyid Gorge, I meet him. But----\"  Beneath the matting a discontented expression came into his face, and  his voice took on a peevish note. \"But I not meet your real great  men--your Arbmishel, your Arreevadon--I not meet them. That's what  gives me the pipovitch. Have _you_ ever met Arbmishel and  Arreevadon?\"    A strained, anguished look came into Mrs. Smethurst's face and was  reflected in the faces of the other members of the circle. The eminent  Russian had sprung two entirely new ones on them, and they felt that  their ignorance was about to be exposed. What would Vladimir Brusiloff  think of the Wood Hills Literary Society? The reputation of the Wood  Hills Literary Society was at stake, trembling in the balance, and  coming up for the third time. In dumb agony Mrs. Smethurst rolled her  eyes about the room searching for someone capable of coming to the  rescue. She drew blank.    And then, from a distant corner, there sounded a deprecating, cough,  and those nearest Cuthbert Banks saw that he had stopped twisting his  right foot round his left ankle and his left foot round his right ankle  and was sitting up with a light of almost human intelligence in his  eyes.    \"Er----\" said Cuthbert, blushing as every eye in the room seemed to fix  itself on him, \"I think he means Abe Mitchell and Harry Vardon.\"    \"Abe Mitchell and Harry Vardon?\" repeated Mrs. Smethurst, blankly. \"I  never heard of----\"    \"Yais! Yais! Most! Very!\" shouted Vladimir Brusiloff, enthusiastically.  \"Arbmishel and Arreevadon. You know them, yes, what, no, perhaps?\"    \"I've played with Abe Mitchell often, and I was partnered with Harry  Vardon in last year's Open.\"    The great Russian uttered a cry that shook the chandelier.    \"You play in ze Open? Why,\" he demanded reproachfully of Mrs.  Smethurst, \"was I not been introducted to this young man who play in  opens?\"    \"Well, really,\" faltered Mrs. Smethurst. \"Well, the fact is, Mr.  Brusiloff----\"    She broke off. She was unequal to the task of explaining, without  hurting anyone's feelings, that she had always regarded Cuthbert as a  piece of cheese and a blot on the landscape.    \"Introduct me!\" thundered the Celebrity.    \"Why, certainly, certainly, of course. This is Mr.----.\"    She looked appealingly at Cuthbert.    \"Banks,\" prompted Cuthbert.    \"Banks!\" cried Vladimir Brusiloff. \"Not Cootaboot Banks?\"    \"_Is_ your name Cootaboot?\" asked Mrs. Smethurst, faintly.    \"Well, it's Cuthbert.\"    \"Y"]]]
