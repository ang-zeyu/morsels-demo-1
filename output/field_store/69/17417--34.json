Our progress  was often retarded by the necessity of dragging after us, during  expeditions of five or six months, twelve, fifteen, and sometimes  more than twenty loaded mules, exchanging these animals every eight  or ten days, and superintending the Indians who were employed in  driving the numerous caravan. Often, in order to add to our  collections of new mineral substances, we found ourselves obliged  to throw away others, which we had collected a considerable time  before. These sacrifices were not less vexatious than the losses we  accidentally sustained. Sad experience taught us but too late, that  from the sultry humidity of the climate, and the frequent falls of  the beasts of burden, we could preserve neither the skins of  animals hastily prepared, nor the fishes and reptiles placed in  phials filled with alcohol. I enter into these details, because,  though little interesting in themselves, they serve to show that we  had no means of bringing back, in their natural state, many objects  of zoology and comparative anatomy, of which we have published  descriptions and drawings. Notwithstanding some obstacles, and the  expense occasioned by the carriage of these articles, I had reason  to applaud the resolution I had taken before my departure, of  sending to Europe the duplicates only of the productions we  collected. I cannot too often repeat, that when the seas are  infested with privateers, a traveller can be sure only of the  objects in his own possession. A very few of the duplicates, which  we shipped for Europe during our abode in America, were saved; the  greater part fell into the hands of persons who feel no interest  for science. When a ship is condemned in a foreign port, boxes  containing only dried plants or stones, instead of being sent to  the scientific men to whom they are addressed, are put aside and  forgotten. Some of our geological collections taken in the Pacific  were, however, more fortunate. We were indebted for their  preservation to the generous activity of Sir Joseph Banks,  President of the Royal Society of London, who, amidst the political  agitations of Europe, unceasingly laboured to strengthen the bonds  of union between scientific men of all nations.    In our investigations we have considered each phenomenon under  different aspects, and classed our remarks according to the  relations they bear to each other. To afford an idea of the method  we have followed, I will here add a succinct enumeration of the  materials with which we were furnished for describing the volcanoes  of Antisana and Pichincha, as well as that of Jorullo: the latter,  during the night of the 20th of September, 1759, rose from the  earth one thousand five hundred and seventy-eight French feet above  the surrounding plains of Mexico. The position of these singular  mountains in longitude and latitude was ascertained by astronomical  observations. We took the heights of the different parts by the aid  of the barometer, and determined the dip of the needle and the  intensity of the magnetic forces. Our collections contain the  plants which are spread over the flanks of these volcanoes, and  specimens of different rocks which, superposed one upon another,  constitute their external coat. We are enabled to indicate, by  measures sufficiently exact, the height above the level of the  ocean, at which we found each group of plants, and each volcanic  rock. Our journals furnish us with a series of observations on the  humidity, the temperature, the electricity, and the degree of  transparency of the air on the brinks of the craters of Pichincha  and Jorullo; they also contain topographical plans and geological  profiles of these mountains, founded in part on the measure of  vertical bases, and on angles of altitude. Each observation has  been calculated according to the tables and the methods which are  considered most exact in the present state of our knowledge; and in  order to judge of the degree of confidence which the results may  claim, we have preserved the whole detail of our partial  operations.    It would have been possible to blend these different materials in a  work devoted wholly to the description of the volcanoes of Peru and  New Spain. Had I given the physical description of a single  province, I could have treated separately everything relating to  its geography, mineralogy, and botany; but how could I interrupt  the narrative of a journey, a disquisition on the manners of a  people, or the great phenomena of nature, by an enumeration of the  productions of the country, the description of new species of  animals and plants, or the detail of astronomical observations. Had  I adopted a mode of composition which would have included in one  and the same chapter all that has been observed on one particular  point of the globe, I should have prepared a work of cumbrous  length, and devoid of that clearness which arises in a great  measure from the methodical distribution of matter. Notwithstanding  the efforts I have made to avoid, in this narrative, the errors I  had to dread, I feel conscious that I have not always succeeded in  separating the observations of detail from those general results  which interest every enlightened mind. These results comprise in  one view the climate and its influence on organized beings, the  aspect of the country, varied according to the nature of the soil  and its vegetable covering, the direction of the mountains and  rivers which separate races of men as well as tribes of plants; and  finally, the modifications observable in the condition of people  living in different latitudes, and in circumstances more or less  favourable to the development of their faculties. I do not fear  having too much enlarged on objects so worthy of attention: one of  the noblest characteristics which distinguish modern civilization  from that of remoter times is, that it has enlarged the mass of our  conceptions, rendered us more capable of perceiving the connection  between the physical and intellectual world, and thrown a more  general interest over objects which heretofore occupied only a few  scientific men, because those objects were contemplated separately,  and from a narrower point of view.    As it is probable that these volumes will obtain the attention of a  greater number of readers than the detail of my observations merely  scientific, or my researches on the population, the commerce, and  the mines of New Spain, I may be permitted here to enumerate all  the works which I have hitherto published conjointly with M.  Bonpland. When several works are interwoven in some sort with each  other, it may perhaps be interesting to the reader to know the  sources whence he may obtain more circumstantial information.    1.I.1. ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS, TRIGONOMETRICAL OPERATIONS, AND    BAROMETRICAL MEASUREMENTS MADE DURING THE COURSE OF A JOURNEY TO    THE EQUINOCTIAL REGIONS OF THE NEW CONTINENT, FROM 1799 TO 1804.    This work, to which are added historical researches on the position  of several points important to navigators, contains, first, the  original observations which I made from the twelfth degree of  southern to the forty-first degree of northern latitude; the  transits of the sun and stars over the meridian; distances of the  moon from the sun and the stars; occultations of the satellites;  eclipses of the sun and moon; transits of Mercury over the disc of  the sun; azimuths; circum-meridian altitudes of the moon, to  determine the longitude by the differences of declination;  researches on the relative intensity of the light of the austral  stars; geodesical measures, etc. Secondly, a treatise on the  astronomical refractions in the torrid zone, considered as the  effect of the decrement of caloric in the strata of the air;  thirdly, the barometric measurement of the Cordillera of the Andes,  of Mexico, of the province of Venezuela, of the kingdom of Quito,  and of New Grenada; followed by geological observations, and  containing the indication of four hundred and fifty-three heights,  calculated according to the method of M. Laplace, and the new  co-efficient of M. Ramond; fourthly, a table of near seven hundred  geographical positions on the New Continent; two hundred and  thirty-five of which have been determined by my own observations,  according to the three co-ordinates of longitude, latitude, and  height.    1.I.2. EQUINOCTIAL PLANTS COLLECTED IN MEXICO, IN THE ISLAND OF    CUBA, IN THE PROVINCES OF CARACAS, CUMANA, AND BARCELONA, ON THE    ANDES OF NEW GRENADA, QUITO, AND PERU, AND ON THE BANKS OF THE RIO    NEGRO, THE ORINOCO, AND THE RIVER AMAZON.    M. Bonpland has in this work given figures of more than forty new  genera of plants of the torrid zone, classed according to their  natural families. The methodical descriptions of the species are  both in French and Latin, and are accompanied by observations on  the medicinal properties of the plants, their use in the arts, and  the climate of the countries in which they are found.    1.I.3. MONOGRAPHY OF THE MELASTOMA, RHEXIA, AND OTHER GENERA OF    THIS ORDER OF PLANTS.    Comprising upwards of a hundred and fifty species of melastomaceae,  which we collected during the course of our expeditions, and which  form one of the most beautiful ornaments of tropical vegetation. M.  Bonpland has added the plants of the same family, which, among many  other rich stores of natural history, M. Richard collected in his  interesting expedition to the Antilles and French Guiana, and the  descriptions of which he has communicated to us.    1.I.4. ESSAY ON THE GEOGRAPHY OF PLANTS, ACCOMPANIED BY A PHYSICAL    TABLE OF THE EQUINOCTIAL REGIONS, FOUNDED ON MEASURES TAKEN FROM    THE TENTH DEGREE OF NORTHERN TO THE TENTH DEGREE OF SOUTHERN  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6329"],[0,"Catalogue of British Columbia Birds (#3)"],[1,"80.
