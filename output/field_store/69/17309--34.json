[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4583"],[0,"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (#3)"],[1,"  attend to the most simple proposition of Euclid. But the refined and  philosophical sceptics fall into an inconsistence of an opposite nature.  They push their researches into the most abstruse corners of science; and  their assent attends them in every step, proportioned to the evidence  which they meet with. They are even obliged to acknowledge, that the most  abstruse and remote objects are those which are best explained by  philosophy. Light is in reality anatomised. The true system of the  heavenly bodies is discovered and ascertained. But the nourishment of  bodies by food is still an inexplicable mystery. The cohesion of the  parts of matter is still incomprehensible. These sceptics, therefore, are  obliged, in every question, to consider each particular evidence apart,  and proportion their assent to the precise degree of evidence which  occurs. This is their practice in all natural, mathematical, moral, and  political science. And why not the same, I ask, in the theological and  religious? Why must conclusions of this nature be alone rejected on the  general presumption of the insufficiency of human reason, without any  particular discussion of the evidence? Is not such an unequal conduct a  plain proof of prejudice and passion?    Our senses, you say, are fallacious; our understanding erroneous; our  ideas, even of the most familiar objects, extension, duration, motion,  full of absurdities and contradictions. You defy me to solve the  difficulties, or reconcile the repugnancies which you discover in them. I  have not capacity for so great an undertaking: I have not leisure for it:  I perceive it to be superfluous. Your own conduct, in every circumstance,  refutes your principles, and shows the firmest reliance on all the  received maxims of science, morals, prudence, and behaviour.    I shall never assent to so harsh an opinion as that of a celebrated  writer [L'Arte de penser], who says, that the Sceptics are not a sect of  philosophers: They are only a sect of liars. I may, however, affirm  (I hope without offence), that they are a sect of jesters or raillers.  But for my part, whenever I find myself disposed to mirth and amusement,  I shall certainly choose my entertainment of a less perplexing and abstruse  nature. A comedy, a novel, or at most a history, seems a more natural  recreation than such metaphysical subtleties and abstractions.    In vain would the sceptic make a distinction between science and common  life, or between one science and another. The arguments employed in all,  if just, are of a similar nature, and contain the same force and  evidence. Or if there be any difference among them, the advantage lies  entirely on the side of theology and natural religion. Many principles of  mechanics are founded on very abstruse reasoning; yet no man who has any  pretensions to science, even no speculative sceptic, pretends to  entertain the least doubt with regard to them. The COPERNICAN system  contains the most surprising paradox, and the most contrary to our  natural conceptions, to appearances, and to our very senses: yet even  monks and inquisitors are now constrained to withdraw their opposition to  it. And shall PHILO, a man of so liberal a genius and extensive  knowledge, entertain any general undistinguished scruples with regard to  the religious hypothesis, which is founded on the simplest and most  obvious arguments, and, unless it meets with artificial obstacles, has  such easy access and admission into the mind of man?    And here we may observe, continued he, turning himself towards DEMEA, a  pretty curious circumstance in the history of the sciences. After the  union of philosophy with the popular religion, upon the first  establishment of Christianity, nothing was more usual, among all  religious teachers, than declamations against reason, against the senses,  against every principle derived merely from human research and inquiry.  All the topics of the ancient academics were adopted by the fathers; and  thence propagated for several ages in every school and pulpit throughout  Christendom. The Reformers embraced the same principles of reasoning, or  rather declamation; and all panegyrics on the excellency of faith, were  sure to be interlarded with some severe strokes of satire against natural  reason. A celebrated prelate [Monsr. Huet] too, of the Romish communion,  a man of the most extensive learning, who wrote a demonstration of  Christianity, has also composed a treatise, which contains all the cavils  of the boldest and most determined PYRRHONISM. LOCKE seems to have been the  first Christian who ventured openly to assert, that faith was nothing but  a species of reason; that religion was only a branch of philosophy; and  that a chain of arguments, similar to that which established any truth in  morals, politics, or physics, was always employed in discovering all the  principles of theology, natural and revealed. The ill use which BAYLE and  other libertines made of the philosophical scepticism of the fathers and  first reformers, still further propagated the judicious sentiment of Mr.  LOCKE: And it is now in a manner avowed, by all pretenders to reasoning  and philosophy, that Atheist and Sceptic are almost synonymous. And as it  is certain that no man is in earnest when he professes the latter  principle, I would fain hope that there are as few who seriously maintain  the former.    Don't you remember, said PHILO, the excellent saying of LORD BACON on  this head? That a little philosophy, replied CLEANTHES, makes a man an  Atheist: A great deal converts him to religion. That is a very judicious  remark too, said PHILO. But what I have in my eye is another passage,  where, having mentioned DAVID's fool, who said in his heart there is no  God, this great philosopher observes, that the Atheists nowadays have a  double share of folly; for they are not contented to say in their hearts  there is no God, but they also utter that impiety with their lips, and  are thereby guilty of multiplied indiscretion and imprudence. Such  people, though they were ever so much in earnest, cannot, methinks, be  very formidable.    But though you should rank me in this class of fools, I cannot forbear  communicating a remark that occurs to me, from the history of the  religious and irreligious scepticism with which you have entertained us.  It appears to me, that there are strong symptoms of priestcraft in the  whole progress of this affair. During ignorant ages, such as those which  followed the dissolution of the ancient schools, the priests perceived,  that Atheism, Deism, or heresy of any kind, could only proceed from the  presumptuous questioning of received opinions, and from a belief that  human reason was equal to every thing. Education had then a mighty  influence over the minds of men, and was almost equal in force to those  suggestions of the senses and common understanding, by which the most  determined sceptic must allow himself to be governed. But at present,  when the influence of education is much diminished, and men, from a more  open commerce of the world, have learned to compare the popular  principles of different nations and ages, our sagacious divines have  changed their whole system of philosophy, and talk the language of  STOICS, PLATONISTS, and PERIPATETICS, not that of PYRRHONIANS and  ACADEMICS. If we distrust human reason, we have now no other principle to  lead us into religion. Thus, sceptics in one age, dogmatists in another;  whichever system best suits the purpose of these reverend gentlemen, in  giving them an ascendant over mankind, they are sure to make it their  favourite principle, and established tenet.    It is very natural, said CLEANTHES, for men to embrace those principles,  by which they find they can best defend their doctrines; nor need we have  any recourse to priestcraft to account for so reasonable an expedient.  And, surely nothing can afford a stronger presumption, that any set of  principles are true, and ought to be embraced, than to observe that they  tend to the confirmation of true religion, and serve to confound the  cavils of Atheists, Libertines, and Freethinkers of all denominations.          PART 2      I must own, CLEANTHES, said DEMEA, that nothing can more surprise me,  than the light in which you have all along put this argument. By the  whole tenor of your discourse, one would imagine that you were  maintaining the Being of a God, against the cavils of Atheists and  Infidels; and were necessitated to become a champion for that fundamental  principle of all religion. But this, I hope, is not by any means a  question among us. No man, no man at least of common sense, I am  persuaded, ever entertained a serious doubt with regard to a truth so  certain and self-evident. The question is not concerning the being, but  the nature of God. This, I affirm, from the infirmities of human  understanding, to be altogether incomprehensible and unknown to us. The  essence of that supreme Mind, his attributes, the manner of his  existence, the very nature of his duration; these, and every particular  which regards so divine a Being, are mysterious to men. Finite, weak, and  blind creatures, we ought to humble ourselves in his august presence;  and, conscious of our frailties, adore in silence his infinite  perfections, which eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard, neither hath it  entered into the heart of man to conceive. They are covered in a deep  cloud from human curiosity. It is profaneness to attempt penetrating  through these sacred obscurities. And, next to the impiety of denying his  existence, is the temerity of prying into his nature and essence, decrees  and attributes.    But lest you should think that my piety has here got the better of my  philosophy, I shall support my opinion, if it needs any support, by a very  great authority. I might cite all the divines, almost, from the foundation  of Christianity, who have ever"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45846"],[0,"Letters Exhibiting the Most Prominent Doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of (#3)"],[1,"who  surrounded the Ancient Saints. The result of my observation seemed to  be, that even Jesus Christ had many objectionable points of character  to those who observed him. Those who were reputedly most conversant  with Abraham, Moses, and other prophets of the Lord, pronounced him  unfit for the respect and confidence of a pious community; and why  did such men find so many objectionable points in the character and  conduct of Jesus Christ? for substantially the same reasons that men  of high intelligence and devotion find fault with Joseph Smith and his  doctrines. Those who bore down with heavy opposition to Jesus Christ  were honourable men, whose genealogy took in the worthiest ancestry;  they were the orthodox expositors of revealed truth. Those who now  oppose Joseph Smith (a person ordained and sent forth by Jesus Christ),  occupy the same high and respectable standing, and manifest a similar  bearing towards the reputed impostor of the present day. The ancient  worthies were the repositories of learning, and so are the modern  worthies. The ancients taught many things according to truth and  godliness, and verily believed they were substantially right in faith  and practice; this is also true of modern religious teachers.    But, in reply to my own question, why the ancient religionists opposed  Jesus Christ? I answer; in the first place, they mistook his true  character and conduct; in the second place, they were palpably ignorant  of the wisdom and godliness of many things in the character and conduct  of Jesus Christ; they considered that there was absolutely a wide  difference in the views and conduct of Jesus Christ and themselves.  The same is true of many distinguished opposers to Joseph Smith; they  consider that there is an irreconcilable difference between themselves  and Mr. Smith; and Mr. Smith, of course, is in the wrong, and they are  in the right.    Now let us consider, first, wherein the ancients mistook the character  of Jesus Christ, and modern opposers to Mr. Smith do the same of him.  The true character of Jesus Christ was very imperfectly known to those  who opposed him in his own time. Many impostors that had preceded, had  guarded the public mind against a repetition of further abuse. He was  eyed with dark suspicion wherever he went. It may well be supposed,  that sage precaution against him was vehemently urged, lest through his  great subtlety he might mislead even some that were respectable. And  what could he do to disabuse the public mind? Prejudice and calumny  outrun and prepared a thorny reception for him in all places; and so  thick and dark was the fog and cloud of misapprehension and falsehood  that followed him, that dark suspicions and foul inferences would  obtrude upon the minds even of the honest, to weaken their convictions  in his behalf, and shake their conclusions. The tale of calumny never  lost in sharpness and effect by time or distance.    Those who had not the privilege of a personal acquaintance with Jesus,  might be supposed to have no interest in favouring a personage whose  pretensions, if countenanced, would disturb their quietude, and impugn  their motives, and threaten the prosperity of a system that they  supposed as old as the days of Abraham, and teachings as orthodox as  the sayings of Moses. But whatever was said or done by Jesus that  could possibly be construed by prejudiced minds to his disadvantage,  these things were heeded with readiness, and published in the social  circle, and riveted by the butt of ridicule upon every mind; and those  who loved to laugh at the expense of the innocent, could furnish stock  for the purpose, by retailing tales about the supposed impostor, that  had their origin in misapprehension and falsehood; but they were well  received and cheered by those who affected grave reverence for the  Supreme Deity, while they could trample with scorn (unconsciously) upon  the _brightness of His glory in the person of His Son_.    Now let me ask if the character and conduct of Mr. Smith is not equally  misunderstood by modern religionists. Mr. Smith only claims to be a  prophet, raised up to usher in the last dispensation, while Jesus  Christ was more obnoxious in proportion to the superior magnitude of  his claims as the Son of God. How difficult it is for persons, in the  present age, to form a correct estimate of the true character and views  of Mr. Smith. The public mind is always forestalled concerning him. It  is taken to be sound orthodoxy that there is no more need of prophets  or revelations; the canon of scripture is full; consequently the man  that will claim to be a prophet, or revelator, and seer, must be a base  impostor and knave. With this educational prejudice, sanctioned by the  best men for a thousand years past, and riveted by solemn vows to abide  in orthodoxy, they see as though they saw not, and hear as though they  heard not.    If excellent things are taught by Mr. Smith, it is considered by  prejudiced minds as a good bait employed to cover a well-barbed hook;  by many he is considered _more_ detestable and dangerous, because, say  they, if he did not mix so much good with his system, he would not be  so dangerous and so likely to deceive.    Again, can the people of this country obtain a correct knowledge of  the prophet through the religious prints? I apprehend they never will.  Those who control the religious prints, conceive they know in the  premises, that God has not raised up such a prophet, therefore they  will not tarnish the columns of their periodicals by publishing any  thing favourable to him. While they feel bound to withhold whatever  might commend the prophet to the favourable regards of impartial men,  they feel solemnly constrained to advertise the public of all rising  heresies. Thus while our supposed heresies are published from very  questionable data, our real virtues are buried in oblivion. We do not  murmur; if Jesus, the master, could not be known in his true character,  but said with mingled pity and forgiveness, they know not what they do,  we cannot expect better treatment from those who know but little of us,  while they say much to our disadvantage.    Paul did the Ancient Saints much harm, and wasted them greatly,  being ignorant of their true character, and unbelieving as to their  doctrines. It is certain that Latter-day Saints have received much  harm from those who are ignorant of their character, and unbelieving  as to their doctrines. Religious editors, generally, know very little  of us, except what they have learned from our enemies. Jesus Christ  was entirely stript of his reputation by his enemies, and was put to  death by learned, yet ignorant, zealots, who were too self-wise to be  taught by one whom they knew to be an impostor in the start; but those  men were mistaken in the character of our Lord; and so are our enemies  mistaken in the character and views of the modern prophet.    My own personal observation teaches that it is a very difficult matter  to instil into the minds of sectarian churches, a true knowledge of the  faith and practice of Latter-day Saints. Though one should go among  them that was once highly esteemed by them, they are alarmed at his  approach, and his virtues are conceived to render him more deserving  of a repulse. His influence, say they, may be formidable; we must not  bid him God speed, consequently he is not asked to pray in the family  or public meeting. If he can, by great effort, get an opportunity to  preach, it is not thought advisable for any body to go and hear him,  lest they should be led away by his errors.    Thus you see, brother, how difficult in former and latter days to bring  the true faith to the knowledge of men, through prejudice. They have  prejudged a matter of which they are almost wholly ignorant. This same  notion of treating new matters has veiled the sun in darkness, and  hung the Prince of Life in agonies. How long shall this treatment of  the Saints be persisted in? How long shall prophets be persecuted and  slain, without being fully known, and the servants of God be excluded  from an impartial hearing, when they seek to publish good tidings--even  salvation to the inhabitants of the earth?    Now let me ask my former friends in the eastern churches, with whom  I once held sweet intercourse, how it is possible for the Latter-day  Saints to introduce their views among the sectarian churches and the  world, with any more favourable reception than the Ancient Saints  had in introducing theirs? Prejudice and persecution faced them down  always, and so it is in these days. It is certainly a mistaken idea  to suppose that people are much better now than they were anciently,  when the true gospel was misunderstood, and its promoters sincerely  accounted disturbers, and heretics worthy of exemplary punishment.  But, say the wise and great men among the sectarian churches, \"we  do understand the true gospel, and have already embraced it, and it  is only error and heresy we oppose; and the weight of our contempt  and ridicule is hurled at impostors and knaves, who palm off gross  deceptions upon the public, and lead captive ignorant zealots by  pretended revelations and spurious miracles.\" But do they not know that  substantially the same charge was brought against Jesus Christ and the  primitive disciples. Let it be proved that we are what our enemies  call us; let us file our respective pleas and come to a speedy and  impartial trial. To this our opposers will not consent; they intend to  employ all the advantage of education and prejudice to exclude us from  a hearing--so did the opposers of the Ancient Saints: but I solemnly  ask whether it has ever been necessary, in any moral enterprise, for  those who have the truth on their side, especially gospel truth, to  defend that truth by foreclosing discussion, and shunning public  investigation, and then carry on their depredations by the use of"]]]
