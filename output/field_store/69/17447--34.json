[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6980"],[0,"Tales of St. Austin's (#3)"],[1," all right,' said Tony.    The next ball Scott hit for four, and the next after that for a couple.  The fifth was a yorker, and just grazed the leg stump. The sixth was a  beauty. You could see it was going to beat the batsman from the moment  it left Tony's hand. Harrison saw it perfectly.    'No ball,' he shouted. And just as he spoke Scott's off-stump  ricocheted towards the wicket-keeper.    'Heavens, man,' said Tony, fairly roused out of his cricket manners, a  very unusual thing for him. 'I'll swear my foot never went over the  crease. Look, there's the mark.'    'Rather not. Only, you see, it seemed to me you chucked that time. Of  course, I know you didn't mean to, and all that sort of thing, but  still, the rules--'    Tony would probably have liked to have said something very forcible  about the rules at this point, but it occurred to him that after all  Harrison was only within his rights, and that it was bad form to  dispute the umpire's decision. Harrison walked off towards square-leg  with a holy joy.    But he was too much of an artist to overdo the thing. Tony's next over  passed off without interference. Possibly, however, this was because it  was a very bad one. After the third over he asked Welch if he could get  somebody else to umpire, as he had work to do. Welch heaved a sigh of  relief, and agreed readily.    'Conscientious sort of chap that umpire of yours,' said Scott to Tony,  after the match. Scott had made a hundred and four, and was feeling  pleased. 'Considering he's in your House, he's awfully fair.'    'You mean that we generally swindle, I suppose?'    'Of course not, you rotter. You know what I mean. But, I say, that  catch Welch and you appealed for must have been a near thing. I could  have sworn I hit it.'    'Of course you did. It was clean out. So was the lbw. I say, did you  think that ball that bowled you was a chuck? That one in my first over,  you know.'    'Chuck! My dear Tony, you don't mean to say that man pulled you up for  chucking? I thought your foot must have gone over the crease.'    'I believe the chap's mad,' said Tony.    'Perhaps he's taking it out of you this way for treading on his corns  somehow. Have you been milling with this gentle youth lately?'    'By Jove,' said Tony, 'you're right. I gave him beans only the other  night for ragging in the dormitory.'    Scott laughed.    'Well, he seems to have been getting a bit of his own back today. Lucky  the game was only a friendly. Why will you let your angry passions  rise, Tony? You've wrecked your analysis by it, though it's improved my  average considerably. I don't know if that's any solid satisfaction to  you.'    'It isn't.'    'You don't say so! Well, so long. If I were you, I should keep an eye  on that conscientious umpire.'    'I will,' said Tony. 'Good-night.'    The process of keeping an eye on Harrison brought no results. When he  wished to behave himself well, he could. On such occasions Sandford and  Merton were literally not in it with him, and the hero of a  Sunday-school story would simply have refused to compete. But Nemesis,  as the poets tell us, though no sprinter, manages, like the celebrated  Maisie, to get right there in time. Give her time, and she will arrive.  She arrived in the case of Harrison. One morning, about a fortnight  after the House-match incident, Harrison awoke with a new sensation. At  first he could not tell what exactly this sensation was, and being too  sleepy to discuss nice points of internal emotion with himself, was  just turning over with the intention of going to sleep again, when the  truth flashed upon him. The sensation he felt was loneliness, and the  reason he felt lonely was because he was the only occupant of the  dormitory. To right and left and all around were empty beds.    As he mused drowsily on these portents, the distant sound of a bell  came to his ears and completed the cure. It was the bell for chapel. He  dragged his watch from under his pillow, and looked at it with  consternation. Four minutes to seven. And chapel was at seven. Now  Harrison had been late for chapel before. It was not the thought of  missing the service that worried him. What really was serious was that  he had been late so many times before that Merevale had hinted at  serious steps to be taken if he were late again, or, at any rate, until  a considerable interval of punctuality had elapsed.    That threat had been uttered only yesterday, and here he was in all  probability late once more.    There was no time to dress. He sprang out of bed, passed a sponge over  his face as a concession to the decencies, and looked round for  something to cover his night-shirt, which, however suitable for  dormitory use, was, he felt instinctively, scarcely the garment to wear  in public.    Fate seemed to fight for him. On one of the pegs in the wall hung a  mackintosh, a large, blessed mackintosh. He was inside it in a moment.    Four minutes later he rushed into his place in chapel.    The short service gave him some time for recovering himself. He left  the building feeling a new man. His costume, though quaint, would not  call for comment. Chapel at St Austin's was never a full-dress  ceremony. Mackintoshes covering night-shirts were the rule rather than  the exception.    But between his costume and that of the rest there was this subtle  distinction. They wore their own mackintoshes. He wore somebody else's.    The bulk of the School had split up into sections, each section making  for its own House, and Merevale's was already in sight, when Harrison  felt himself grasped from behind. He turned, to see Graham.    'Might I ask,' enquired Tony with great politeness, 'who said you might  wear my mackintosh?'    Harrison gasped.    'I suppose you didn't know it was mine?'    'No, no, rather not. I didn't know.'    'And if you had known it was mine, you wouldn't have taken it, I  suppose?'    'Oh no, of course not,' said Harrison. Graham seemed to be taking an  unexpectedly sensible view of the situation.    'Well,' said Tony, 'now that you know that it is mine, suppose you give  it up.'    'Give it up!'    'Yes; buck up. It looks like rain, and I mustn't catch cold.'    'But, Graham, I've only got on--'    'Spare us these delicate details. Mack up, please, I want it.'    Finally, Harrison appearing to be difficult in the matter, Tony took  the garment off for him, and went on his way.    Harrison watched him go with mixed feelings. Righteous indignation  struggled with the gravest apprehension regarding his own future. If  Merevale should see him! Horrible thought. He ran. He had just reached  the House, and was congratulating himself on having escaped, when the  worst happened. At the private entrance stood Merevale, and with him  the Headmaster himself. They both eyed him with considerable interest  as he shot in at the boys' entrance.    'Harrison,' said Merevale after breakfast.    'Yes, sir?'    'The Headmaster wishes to see you--again.'    'Yes, sir,' said Harrison.    There was a curious lack of enthusiasm in his voice.          [3]    L'AFFAIRE UNCLE JOHN  (_A Story in Letters_)        I    From Richard Venables, of St Austin's School, to his brother Archibald  Venables, of King's College, Cambridge:    Dear Archie--I take up my pen to write to you, not as one hoping for an  answer, but rather in order that (you notice the Thucydidean  construction) I may tell you of an event the most important of those  that have gone before. You may or may not have heard far-off echoes of  my adventure with Uncle John, who has just come back from the  diamond-mines--and looks it. It happened thusly:    Last Wednesday evening I was going through the cricket field to meet  Uncle John, at the station, as per esteemed favour from the governor,  telling me to. Just as I got on the scene, to my horror, amazement, and  disgust, I saw a middle-aged bounder, in loud checks, who, from his  looks, might have been anything from a retired pawnbroker to a  second-hand butler, sacked from his last place for stealing the  sherry, standing in the middle of the field, on the very wicket the  Rugborough match is to be played on next Saturday (tomorrow), and  digging--_digging_--I'll trouble you. Excavating great chunks of  our best turf with a walking-stick. I was so unnerved, I nearly  fainted. It's bad enough being captain of a School team under any  circs., as far as putting you off your game goes, but when you see the  wicket you've been rolling by day, and dreaming about by night, being  mangled by an utter stranger--well! They say a cow is slightly  irritated when her calf is taken away from her, but I don't suppose the  most maternal cow that ever lived came anywhere near the frenzy that  surged up in my bosom at that moment. I flew up to him, foaming at the  mouth. 'My dear sir,' I shrieked, '_are_ you aware that you're  spoiling the best wicket that has ever been prepared since cricket  began?' He looked at me, in a dazed sort of way, and said, 'What?' I  said: 'How on earth do you think we're going to play Rugborough on a  ploughed field?' 'I don't follow, mister,' he replied. A man who calls  you 'mister' is beyond the pale. You are justified in being a little  rude to him. So I said: 'Then you must be either drunk or mad, and I  trust it's the latter.' I believe that's from some book, though I don't  remember which. This did seem to wake him up a bit, but before he could  frame his opinion in words, up came Biffen, the ground-man, to have a  last look at his wicket before retiring for the night. When he saw the  holes--they were about a foot deep, and scattered promiscuously, just  where two balls out of three pitch--he almost had hysterics. I gently  explained the situation to him, and left him to settle with my friend  of the check suit. Biffen was just settling down to a sort of Philippic  when I went, and I knew that I had left the man in competent hands.  Then I went to the station. The "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6984"],[0,"The Pothunters (#3)"],[1,"room so fit a hunting-ground for the burgling  industry. There are few pleasures keener than the pleasure of telling  somebody something he didn't know before.    'Great Scott,' he remarked, 'haven't you heard? No, of course you went  up to Aldershot before they did it. By Jove.'    'Did what?'    'Why, they shunted all the Sports prizes from the Board Room to the  Pav. and shot 'em into the First room. I don't suppose there's one left  now. I should like to see the Old Man's face when he hears about it.  Good mind to go and tell him now, only he'd have a fit. Jolly exciting,  though, isn't it?'    'Well,' said Tony, 'of all the absolutely idiotic things to do! Fancy  putting--there must have been at least fifty pounds' worth of silver  and things. Fancy going and leaving all that overnight in the Pav!'    'Rotten!' agreed Welch. 'Wonder whose idea it was.'    'Look here, Robinson,' said Tony, 'you'd better buck up and change, or  you'll be late for brekker. Come on, Welch, we'll go and inspect the  scene of battle.'    Robinson trotted off, and Welch and Tony made their way to the  Pavilion. There, sure enough, was the window, or rather the absence of  window. A pane had been neatly removed, evidently in the orthodox way  by means of a diamond.    'May as well climb up and see if there's anything to be seen,' said  Welch.    'All right,' said Tony, 'give us a leg up. Right-ho. By Jove, I'm  stiff.'    'See anything?'    'No. There's a cloth sort of thing covering what I suppose are the  prizes. I see how the chap, whoever he was, got in. You've only got to  break the window, draw a couple of bolts, and there you are. Shall I go  in and investigate?'    'Better not. It's rather the thing, I fancy, in these sorts of cases,  to leave everything just as it is.'    'Rum business,' said Tony, as he rejoined Welch on terra firma. 'Wonder  if they'll catch the chap. We'd better be getting back to the House  now. It struck the quarter years ago.'    When Tony, some twenty minutes later, shook off the admiring crowd who  wanted a full description of yesterday's proceedings, and reached his  study, he found there James Thomson, brother to Allen Thomson, as the  playbills say. Jim was looking worried. Tony had noticed it during  breakfast, and had wondered at the cause. He was soon enlightened.    'Hullo, Jim,' said he. 'What's up with you this morning? Feeling  chippy?'    'No. No, I'm all right. I'm in a beastly hole though. I wanted to talk  to you about it.'    'Weigh in, then. We've got plenty of time before school.'    'It's about this Aldershot business. How on earth did you manage to  lick Allen like that? I thought he was a cert.'    'Yes, so did I. The 'ole thing there, as Dawkins 'ud say, was, I  knocked him out. It's the sort of thing that's always happening. I  wasn't in it at all except during the second round, when I gave him  beans rather in one of the corners. My aunt, it was warm while it  lasted. First round, I didn't hit him once. He was better than I  thought he'd be, and I knew from experience he was pretty good.'    'Yes, you look a bit bashed.'    'Yes. Feel it too. But what's the row with you?'    'Just this. I had a couple of quid on Allen, and the rotter goes and  gets licked.'    'Good Lord. Whom did you bet with?'    'With Allen himself.'    'Mean to say Allen was crock enough to bet against himself? He must  have known he was miles better than anyone else in. He's got three  medals there already.'    'No, you see his bet with me was only a hedge. He'd got five to four or  something in quids on with a chap in his House at Rugby on himself. He  wanted a hedge because he wasn't sure about his ankle being all right.  You know he hurt it. So I gave him four to one in half-sovereigns. I  thought he was a cert, with apologies to you.'    'Don't mention it. So he was a cert. It was only the merest fluke I  managed to out him when I did. If he'd hung on to the end, he'd have  won easy. He'd been scoring points all through.'    'I know. So _The Sportsman_ says. Just like my luck.'    'I can't see what you want to bet at all for. You're bound to come a  mucker sooner or later. Can't you raise the two quid?'    'I'm broke except for half a crown.'    'I'd lend it to you like a shot if I had it, of course. But you don't  find me with two quid to my name at the end of term. Won't Allen wait?'    'He would if it was only him. But this other chap wants his oof badly  for something and he's leaving and going abroad or something at the end  of term. Anyhow, I know he's keen on getting it. Allen told me.'    Tony pondered for a moment. 'Look here,' he said at last, 'can't you  ask your pater? He usually heaves his money about pretty readily,  doesn't he?'    'Well, you see, he wouldn't send me two quid off the reel without  wanting to know all about it, and why I couldn't get on to the holidays  with five bob, and I'd either have to fake up a lot of lies, which I'm  not going to do--'    'Of course not.'    'Or else I must tell him I've been betting.'    'Well, he bets himself, doesn't he?'    'That's just where the whole business slips up,' replied Jim, prodding  the table with a pen in a misanthropic manner. 'Betting's the one thing  he's absolutely down on. He got done rather badly once a few years ago.  Believe he betted on Orme that year he got poisoned. Anyhow he's always  sworn to lynch us if we made fools of ourselves that way. So if I asked  him, I'd not only get beans myself, besides not getting any money out  of him, but Allen would get scalped too, which he wouldn't see at all.'    'Yes, it's no good doing that. Haven't you any other source of  revenue?'    'Yes, there's just one chance. If that doesn't come off, I'm done. My  pater said he'd give me a quid for every race I won at the sports. I  got the half yesterday all right when you were up at Aldershot.'    'Good man. I didn't hear about that. What time? Anything good?'    'Nothing special. 2-7 and three-fifths.'    'That's awfully good. You ought to pull off the mile, too, I should  think.'    'Yes, with luck. Drake's the man I'm afraid of. He's done it in 4-48  twice during training. He was second in the half yesterday by about  three yards, but you can't tell anything from that. He sprinted too  late.'    'What's your best for the mile?'    'I have done 4-47, but only once. 4-48's my average, so there's nothing  to choose between us on paper.'    'Well, you've got more to make you buck up than he has. There must be  something in that.'    'Yes, by Jove. I'll win if I expire on the tape. I shan't spare myself  with that quid on the horizon.'    'No. Hullo, there's the bell. We must buck up. Going to Charteris'  gorge tonight?'    'Yes, but I shan't eat anything. No risks for me.'    'Rusks are more in your line now. Come on.'    And, in the excitement of these more personal matters, Tony entirely  forgot to impart the news of the Pavilion burglary to him.          [3]    AN UNIMPORTANT BY-PRODUCT      The news, however, was not long in spreading. Robinson took care of  that. On the way to school he overtook his friend Morrison, a young  gentleman who had the unique distinction of being the rowdiest fag in  Ward's House, which, as any Austinian could have told you, was the  rowdiest house in the School.    'I say, Morrison, heard the latest?'    'No, what?'    'Chap broke into the Pav. last night.'    'Who, you?'    'No, you ass, a regular burglar. After the Sports prizes.'    'Look here, Robinson, try that on the kids.'    'Just what I am doing,' said Robinson.    This delicate reference to Morrison's tender years had the effect of  creating a disturbance. Two School House juniors, who happened to be  passing, naturally forsook all their other aims and objects and joined  the battle.    'What's up?' asked one of them, dusting himself hastily as they stopped  to take breath. It was always his habit to take up any business that  might attract his attention, and ask for explanations afterwards.    'This kid--' began Morrison.    'Kid yourself, Morrison.'    'This lunatic, then.' Robinson allowed the emendation to pass. 'This  lunatic's got some yarn on about the Pav. being burgled.'    'So it is. Tell you I saw it myself.'    'Did it yourself, probably.'    'How do you know, anyway? You seem so jolly certain about it.'    'Why, there's a pane of glass cut out of the window in the First room.'    'Shouldn't wonder, you know,' said Dimsdale, one of the two School  House fags, judicially, 'if the kid wasn't telling the truth for once  in his life. Those pots must be worth something. Don't you think so,  Scott?'    Scott admitted that there might be something in the idea, and that,  however foreign to his usual habits, Robinson might on this occasion be  confining himself more or less to strict fact.    'There you are, then,' said Robinson, vengefully. 'Shows what a fat lot  you know what you're talking about, Morrison.'    'Morrison's a fool,' said Scott. 'Ever since he got off the bottom  bench in form there's been no holding him.'    'All the same,' said Morrison, feeling that matters were going against  him, 'I shan't believe it till I see it.'    'What'll you bet?' said Robinson.    'I never bet,' replied Morrison with scorn.    'You daren't. You know you'd lose.'    'All right, then, I'll bet a penny I'm right.' He drew a deep breath,  as who should say, 'It's a lot of money, but it's worth risking it.'    'You'll lose that penny, old chap,' said Robinson. 'That's to say,' he  added thoughtfully, 'if you ever pay up.'    'You've got us as witnesses,' said Dimsdale. 'We'll see that he shells  out. Scott, remember you're a witness.    'Right-ho,' said Scott.    At this moment the clock struck nine, and as each of the principals in  this financial transaction, and both the witnesses, were expected to be  in their places to answer their names at 8.58, they were late. And as  they had all been late the day before and the day before that,"]]]
