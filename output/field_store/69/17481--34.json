LYSISTRATA    Yes, isn't she  Very open, in some ways particularly.    LAMPITO    But who's garred this Council o' Women to meet here?    LYSISTRATA    I have.    LAMPITO    Propound then what you want o' us.    MYRRHINE    What is the amazing news you have to tell?    LYSISTRATA    I'll tell you, but first answer one small question.    MYRRHINE    As you like.    LYSISTRATA    Are you not sad your children's fathers  Go endlessly off soldiering afar  In this plodding war? I am willing to wager  There's not one here whose husband is at home.    CALONICE    Mine's been in Thrace, keeping an eye on Eucrates  For five months past.    MYRRHINE    And mine left me for Pylos  Seven months ago at least.    LAMPITO    And as for mine  No sooner has he slipped out frae the line  He straps his shield and he's snickt off again.    LYSISTRATA    And not the slightest glitter of a lover!  And since the Milesians betrayed us, I've not seen  The image of a single upright man  To be a marble consolation to us.  Now will you help me, if I find a means  To stamp the war out.    MYRRHINE    By the two Goddesses, Yes!  I will though I've to pawn this very dress  And drink the barter-money the same day.    CALONICE    And I too though I'm split up like a turbot  And half is hackt off as the price of peace.    LAMPITO    And I too! Why, to get a peep at the shy thing  I'd clamber up to the tip-top o' Taygetus.    LYSISTRATA    Then I'll expose my mighty mystery.  O women, if we would compel the men  To bow to Peace, we must refrain--    MYRRHINE    From what?  O tell us!    LYSISTRATA    Will you truly do it then?    MYRRHINE    We will, we will, if we must die for it.    LYSISTRATA    We must refrain from every depth of love....  Why do you turn your backs? Where are you going?  Why do you bite your lips and shake your heads?  Why are your faces blanched? Why do you weep?  Will you or won't you, or what do you mean?    MYRRHINE    No, I won't do it. Let the war proceed.    CALONICE    No, I won't do it. Let the war proceed.    LYSISTRATA    You too, dear turbot, you that said just now  You didn't mind being split right up in the least?    CALONICE    Anything else? O bid me walk in fire  But do not rob us of that darling joy.  What else is like it, dearest Lysistrata?    LYSISTRATA    And you?    MYRRHINE    O please give me the fire instead.    LYSISTRATA    Lewd to the least drop in the tiniest vein,  Our sex is fitly food for Tragic Poets,  Our whole life's but a pile of kisses and babies.  But, hardy Spartan, if you join with me  All may be righted yet. O help me, help me.    LAMPITO    It's a sair, sair thing to ask of us, by the Twa,  A lass to sleep her lane and never fill  Love's lack except wi' makeshifts.... But let it be.  Peace maun be thought of first.    LYSISTRATA    My friend, my friend!  The only one amid this herd of weaklings.    CALONICE    But if--which heaven forbid--we should refrain  As you would have us, how is Peace induced?    LYSISTRATA    By the two Goddesses, now can't you see  All we have to do is idly sit indoors  With smooth roses powdered on our cheeks,  Our bodies burning naked through the folds  Of shining Amorgos' silk, and meet the men  With our dear Venus-plats plucked trim and neat.  Their stirring love will rise up furiously,  They'll beg our arms to open. That's our time!  We'll disregard their knocking, beat them off--  And they will soon be rabid for a Peace.  I'm sure of it.    LAMPITO              Just as Menelaus, they say,  Seeing the bosom of his naked Helen  Flang down the sword.    CALONICE                   But we'll be tearful fools  If our husbands take us at our word and leave us.    LYSISTRATA    There's only left then, in Pherecrates' phrase,  _To flay a skinned dog_--flay more our flayed desires.    CALONICE    Bah, proverbs will never warm a celibate.  But what avail will your scheme be if the men  Drag us for all our kicking on to the couch?    LYSISTRATA    Cling to the doorposts.    CALONICE                   But if they should force us?    LYSISTRATA    Yield then, but with a sluggish, cold indifference.  There is no joy to them in sullen mating.  Besides we have other ways to madden them;  They cannot stand up long, and they've no delight  Unless we fit their aim with merry succour.    CALONICE    Well if you must have it so, we'll all agree.    LAMPITO    For us I ha' no doubt. We can persuade  Our men to strike a fair an' decent Peace,  But how will ye pitch out the battle-frenzy  O' the Athenian populace?    LYSISTRATA    I promise you  We'll wither up that curse.    LAMPITO    I don't believe it.  Not while they own ane trireme oared an' rigged,  Or a' those stacks an' stacks an' stacks O' siller.    LYSISTRATA    I've thought the whole thing out till there's no flaw.  We shall surprise the Acropolis today:  That is the duty set the older dames.  While we sit here talking, they are to go  And under pretence of sacrificing, seize it.    LAMPITO    Certie, that's fine; all's working for the best.    LYSISTRATA    Now quickly, Lampito, let us tie ourselves  To this high purpose as tightly as the hemp of words  Can knot together.    LAMPITO    Set out the terms in detail  And we'll a' swear to them.    LYSISTRATA    Of course.... Well then  Where is our Scythianess? Why are you staring?  First lay the shield, boss downward, on the floor  And bring the victim's inwards.    CAILONICE    But, Lysistrata,  What is this oath that we're to swear?    LYSISTRATA    What oath!  In Aeschylus they take a slaughtered sheep  And swear upon a buckler. Why not we?    CALONICE    O Lysistrata, Peace sworn on a buckler!    LYSISTRATA    What oath would suit us then?    CALONICE    Something burden bearing  Would be our best insignia.... A white horse!  Let's swear upon its entrails.    LYSISTRATA    A horse indeed!    CALONICE    Then what will symbolise us?    LYSISTRATA    This, as I tell you--  First set a great dark bowl upon the ground  And disembowel a skin of Thasian wine,  Then swear that we'll not add a drop of water.    LAMPITO    Ah, what aith could clink pleasanter than that!    LYSISTRATA    Bring me a bowl then and a skin of wine.    CALONICE    My dears, see what a splendid bowl it is;    I'd not say No if asked to sip it off.    LYSISTRATA    Put down the bowl. Lay hands, all, on the victim.    Skiey Queen who givest the last word in arguments,    And thee, O Bowl, dear comrade, we beseech:    Accept our oblation and be propitious to us.    CALONICE    What healthy blood, la, how it gushes out!    LAMPITO    An' what a leesome fragrance through the air.    LYSISTRATA    Now, dears, if you will let me, I'll speak first.    CALONICE    Only if you draw the lot, by Aphrodite!    LYSISTRATA    SO, grasp the brim, you, Lampito, and all.    You, Calonice, repeat for the rest    Each word I say. Then you must all take oath    And pledge your arms to the same stern conditions--    LYSISTRATA    To husband or lover I'll not open arms    CALONICE    _To husband or lover I'll not open arms_    LYSISTRATA    Though love and denial may enlarge his charms.    CALONICE    _Though love and denial may enlarge his charms._  O, O, my knees are failing me, Lysistrata!    LYSISTRATA    But still at home, ignoring him, I'll stay,    CALONICE    _But still at home, ignoring him, I'll stay,_    LYSISTRATA    Beautiful, clad in saffron silks all day.    CALONICE    _Beautiful, clad in saffron silks all day._    LYSISTRATA    If then he seizes me by dint of force,    CALONICE    _If then he seizes me by dint of force,_    LYSISTRATA    I'll give him reason for a long remorse.    CALONICE    _I'll give him reason for a long remorse._    LYSISTRATA    I'll never lie and stare up at the ceiling,    CALONICE    _I'll never lie and stare up at the ceiling,_    LYSISTRATA    Nor like a lion on all fours go kneeling.    CALONICE    _Nor like a lion on all fours go kneeling._    LYSISTRATA    If I keep faith, then bounteous cups be mine.    CALONICE    _If I keep faith, then bounteous cups be mine._    LYSISTRATA    If not, to nauseous water change this wine.    CALONICE    _If not, to nauseous water change this wine._    LYSISTRATA    Do you all swear to this?    MYRRHINE    We do, we do.    LYSISTRATA    Then I shall immolate the victim thus.  _She drinks._    CALONICE    Here now, share fair, haven't we made a pact?  Let's all quaff down that friendship in our turn.    LAMPITO    Hark, what caterwauling hubbub's that?    LYSISTRATA    As I told you,  The women have appropriated the citadel.  So, Lampito, dash off to your own land  And raise the rebels there. These will serve as hostages,  While we ourselves take our places in the ranks  And drive the bolts right home.    CALONICE    But won't the men  March straight against us?    LYSISTRATA    And what if they do?  No threat shall creak our hinges wide, no torch  Shall light a fear in us; we will come out  To Peace alone.    CALONICE    That's it, by Aphrodite!  As of old let us seem hard and obdurate.    LAMPITO _and some go off; the others go up into the Acropolis._    _Chorus of_ OLD MEN _enter to attack the captured Acropolis_.    Make room, Draces, move ahead; why your shoulder's chafed, I see,  With lugging uphill these lopped branches of the olive-tree.  How upside-down and wrong-way-round a long life sees things grow.  Ah, Strymodorus, who'd have thought affairs could tangle so?    The women whom at home we fed,  Like witless fools, with fostering bread,  Have impiously come to this--  They've stolen the Acropolis,  With bolts and bars our orders flout  And shut us out.    Come, Philurgus, bustle thither; lay our faggots on the ground,  In neat stacks beleaguering the insurgents all around;  And the vile conspiratresses, plotters of such mischief dire,  Pile and burn them all together in one vast and righteous pyre:  Fling"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/775"],[0,"When the Sleeper Wakes (#3)"],[1," things, not dynamos--\"    \"Induction coils.\"    \"Yes. You could see his muscles throb and jump, and he twisted about.  There was just two flaring yellow candles, and all the shadows were  shivering, and the little doctor nervous and putting on side, and  him--stark and squirming in the most unnatural ways. Well, it made me  dream.\"    Pause.    \"It's a strange state,\" said Warming.    \"It's a sort of complete absence,\" said Isbister.    \"Here's the body, empty. Not dead a bit, and yet not alive. It's like a  seat vacant and marked 'engaged.' No feeling, no digestion, no beating  of the heart--not a flutter. _That_ doesn't make me feel as if there was  a man present. In a sense it's more dead than death, for these doctors  tell me that even the hair has stopped growing. Now with the proper  dead, the hair will go on growing--\"    \"I know,\" said Warming, with a flash of pain in his expression.    They peered through the glass again. Graham was indeed in a strange  state, in the flaccid phase of a trance, but a trance unprecedented in  medical history. Trances had lasted for as much as a year before--but at  the end of that time it had ever been waking or a death; sometimes first  one and then the other. Isbister noted the marks the physicians had  made in injecting nourishment, for that device had been resorted to to  postpone collapse; he pointed them out to Warming, who had been trying  not to see them.    \"And while he has been lying here,\" said Isbister, with the zest of a  life freely spent, \"I have changed my plans in life; married, raised  a family, my eldest lad--I hadn't begun to think of sons then--is an  American citizen, and looking forward to leaving Harvard. There's  a touch of grey in my hair. And this man, not a day older nor wiser  (practically) than I was in my downy days. It's curious to think of.\"    Warming turned. \"And I have grown old too. I played cricket with him  when I was still only a lad. And he looks a young man still. Yellow  perhaps. But that is a young man nevertheless.\"    \"And there's been the War,\" said Isbister.    \"From beginning to end.\"    \"And these Martians.\"    \"I've understood,\" said Isbister after a pause, \"that he had some  moderate property of his own?\"    \"That is so,\" said Warming. He coughed primly. \"As it happens--have  charge of it.\"    \"Ah!\" Isbister thought, hesitated and spoke: \"No doubt--his keep here is  not expensive--no doubt it will have improved--accumulated?\"    \"It has. He will wake up very much better off--if he wakes--than when he  slept.\"    \"As a business man,\" said Isbister, \"that thought has naturally been in  my mind. I have, indeed, sometimes thought that, speaking commercially,  of course, this sleep may be a very good thing for him. That he knows  what he is about, so to speak, in being insensible so long. If he had  lived straight on--\"    \"I doubt if he would have premeditated as much,\" said Warming. \"He was  not a far-sighted man. In fact--\"    \"Yes?\"    \"We differed on that point. I stood to him somewhat in the relation of  a guardian. You have probably seen enough of affairs to recognise that  occasionally a certain friction--. But even if that was the case, there  is a doubt whether he will ever wake. This sleep exhausts slowly, but  it exhausts. Apparently he is sliding slowly, very slowly and tediously,  down a long slope, if you can understand me?\"    \"It will be a pity to lose his surprise. There's been a lot of change  these twenty years. It's Rip Van Winkle come real.\"    \"It's Bellamy,\" said Warming. \"There has been a lot of change certainly.  And, among other changes, I have changed. I am an old man.\"    Isbister hesitated, and then feigned a belated surprise. \"I shouldn't  have thought it.\"    \"I was forty-three when his bankers--you remember you wired to his  bankers--sent on to me.\"    \"I got their address from the cheque book in his pocket,\" said Isbister.    \"Well, the addition is not difficult,\" said Warming.    There was another pause, and then Isbister gave way to an unavoidable  curiosity. \"He may go on for years yet,\" he said, and had a moment of  hesitation. \"We have to consider that. His affairs, you know, may fall  some day into the hands of--someone else, you know.\"    \"That, if you will believe me, Mr. Isbister, is one of the problems most  constantly before my mind. We happen to be--as a matter of fact, there  are no very trustworthy connections of ours. It is a grotesque and  unprecedented position.\"    \"It is,\" said Isbister. \"As a matter of fact, it's a case for a public  trustee, if only we had such a functionary.\"    \"It seems to me it's a case for some public body, some practically  undying guardian. If he really is going on living--as the doctors, some  of them, think. As a matter of fact, I have gone to one or two public  men about it. But, so far, nothing has been done.\"    \"It wouldn't be a bad idea to hand him over to some public body--the  British Museum Trustees, or the Royal College of Physicians. Sounds a  bit odd, of course, but the whole situation is odd.\"    \"The difficulty is to induce them to take him.\"    \"Red tape, I suppose?\"    \"Partly.\"    Pause. \"It's a curious business, certainly,\" said Isbister. \"And  compound interest has a way of mounting up.\"    \"It has,\" said Warming. \"And now the gold supplies are running short  there is a tendency towards ... appreciation.\"    \"I've felt that,\" said Isbister with a grimace. \"But it makes it better  for him.\"    \"If he wakes.\"    \"If he wakes,\" echoed Isbister. \"Do you notice the pinched-ill look of  his nose, and the way in which his eyelids sink?\"    Warming looked and thought for a space. \"I doubt if he will wake,\" he  said at last.    \"I never properly understood,\" said Isbister, \"what it was brought this  on. He told me something about overstudy. I've often been curious.\"    \"He was a man of considerable gifts, but spasmodic, emotional. He had  grave domestic troubles, divorced his wife, in fact, and it was as a  relief from that, I think, that he took up politics of the rabid sort.  He was a fanatical Radical--a Socialist--or typical Liberal,  as they used to call themselves, of the advanced school.  Energetic--flighty--undisciplined. Overwork upon a controversy did this  for him. I remember the pamphlet he wrote--a curious production. Wild,  whirling stuff. There were one or two prophecies. Some of them are  already exploded, some of them are established facts. But for the  most part to read such a thesis is to realise how full the world is of  unanticipated things. He will have much to learn, much to unlearn, when  he wakes. If ever a waking comes.\"    \"I'd give anything to be there,\" said Isbister, \"just to hear what he  would say to it all.\"    \"So would I,\" said Warming. \"Aye! so would I,\" with an old man's sudden  turn to self pity. \"But I shall never see him wake.\"    He stood looking thoughtfully at the waxen figure. \"He will never wake,\"  he said at last. He sighed \"He will never wake again.\"        CHAPTER III. THE AWAKENING    But Warming was wrong in that. An awakening came.    What a wonderfully complex thing! this simple seeming unity--the self!  Who can trace its reintegration as morning after morning we awaken, the  flux and confluence of its countless factors interweaving, rebuilding,  the dim first stirrings of the soul, the growth and synthesis of  the unconscious to the subconscious, the sub-conscious to dawning  consciousness, until at last we recognise ourselves again. And as it  happens to most of us after the night's sleep, so it was with Graham at  the end of his vast slumber. A dim cloud of sensation taking shape, a  cloudy dreariness, and he found himself vaguely somewhere, recumbent,  faint, but alive.    The pilgrimage towards a personal being seemed to traverse vast gulfs,  to occupy epochs. Gigantic dreams that were terrible realities at the  time, left vague perplexing memories, strange creatures, strange  scenery, as if from another planet. There was a distinct impression,  too, of a momentous conversation, of a name--he could not tell what  name--that was subsequently to recur, of some queer long-forgotten  sensation of vein and muscle, of a feeling of vast hopeless effort, the  effort of a man near drowning in darkness. Then came a panorama of  dazzling unstable confluent scenes.    Graham became aware his eyes were open and regarding some unfamiliar  thing.    It was something white, the edge of something, a frame of wood. He  moved his head slightly, following the contour of this shape. It went up  beyond the top of his eyes. He tried to think where he might be. Did it  matter, seeing he was so wretched? The colour of his thoughts was a dark  depression. He felt the featureless misery of one who wakes towards  the hour of dawn. He had an uncertain sense of whispers and footsteps  hastily receding.    The movement of his head involved a perception of extreme physical  weakness. He supposed he was in bed in the hotel at the place in the  valley--but he could not recall that white edge. He must have slept. He  remembered now that he had wanted to sleep. He recalled the cliff and  waterfall again, and then recollected something about talking to a  passer-by.    How long had he slept? What was that sound of pattering feet? And that  rise and fall, like the murmur of breakers on pebbles? He put out a  languid hand to reach his watch from the chair whereon it was his habit  to place it, and touched some smooth hard surface like glass. This was  so unexpected that it startled him extremely. Quite suddenly he rolled  over, stared for a moment, and struggled into a sitting position. The  effort was unexpectedly difficult, and it left him giddy and weak--and  amazed.    He rubbed his eyes. The riddle of his surroundings was confusing but his  mind was quite clear--evidently his sleep had benefited him. He was not  in a bed at all as he understood the word, but lying naked on a very  soft and yielding mattress,"]]]
