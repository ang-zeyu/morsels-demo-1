Our discourse proceeded  altogether concerning sensible things, which you defined to be, THE  THINGS WE IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVE BY OUR SENSES. Whatever other qualities,  therefore, you speak of as distinct from these, I know nothing of them,  neither do they at all belong to the point in dispute. You may, indeed,  pretend to have discovered certain qualities which you do not perceive,  and assert those insensible qualities exist in fire and sugar. But what  use can be made of this to your present purpose, I am at a loss to  conceive. Tell me then once more, do you acknowledge that heat and cold,  sweetness and bitterness (meaning those qualities which are perceived by  the senses), do not exist without the mind?    HYL.  I see it is to no purpose to hold out, so I give up the cause as  to those mentioned qualities. Though I profess it sounds oddly, to say  that sugar is not sweet.    PHIL.  But, for your farther satisfaction, take this along with you:  that which at other times seems sweet, shall, to a distempered palate,  appear bitter. And, nothing can be plainer than that divers persons  perceive different tastes in the same food; since that which one man  delights in, another abhors. And how could this be, if the taste was  something really inherent in the food?    HYL.  I acknowledge I know not how.    PHIL.  In the next place, ODOURS are to be considered. And, with  regard to these, I would fain know whether what hath been said of  tastes doth not exactly agree to them? Are they not so many pleasing or  displeasing sensations?    HYL.  They are.    PHIL.  Can you then conceive it possible that they should exist in an  unperceiving thing?    HYL.  I cannot.    PHIL.  Or, can you imagine that filth and ordure affect those brute  animals that feed on them out of choice, with the same smells which we  perceive in them?    HYL.  By no means.    PHIL.  May we not therefore conclude of smells, as of the other  forementioned qualities, that they cannot exist in any but a perceiving  substance or mind?    HYL.  I think so.    PHIL.  Then as to SOUNDS, what must we think of them: are they  accidents really inherent in external bodies, or not?    HYL.  That they inhere not in the sonorous bodies is plain from hence:  because a bell struck in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump sends  forth no sound. The air, therefore, must be thought the subject of sound.    PHIL.  What reason is there for that, Hylas?    HYL.  Because, when any motion is raised in the air, we perceive a sound  greater or lesser, according to the air's motion; but without some motion  in the air, we never hear any sound at all.    PHIL.  And granting that we never hear a sound but when some motion is  produced in the air, yet I do not see how you can infer from thence, that  the sound itself is in the air.    HYL.  It is this very motion in the external air that produces in the  mind the sensation of SOUND. For, striking on the drum of the ear, it  causeth a vibration, which by the auditory nerves being communicated to  the brain, the soul is thereupon affected with the sensation called  SOUND.    PHIL.  What! is sound then a sensation?    HYL.  I tell you, as perceived by us, it is a particular sensation in  the mind.    PHIL.  And can any sensation exist without the mind?    HYL.  No, certainly.    PHIL.  How then can sound, being a sensation, exist in the air, if by  the AIR you mean a senseless substance existing without the mind?    HYL.  You must distinguish, Philonous, between sound as it is  perceived by us, and as it is in itself; or (which is the same thing)  between the sound we immediately perceive, and that which exists without  us. The former, indeed, is a particular kind of sensation, but the latter  is merely a vibrative or undulatory motion the air.    PHIL.  I thought I had already obviated that distinction, by answer I  gave when you were applying it in a like case before. But, to say no more  of that, are you sure then that sound is really nothing but motion?    HYL.  I am.    PHIL.  Whatever therefore agrees to real sound, may with truth be  attributed to motion?    HYL.  It may.    PHIL.  It is then good sense to speak of MOTION as of a thing that is  LOUD, SWEET, ACUTE, or GRAVE.    HYL.  _I_ see you are resolved not to understand me. Is it not evident  those accidents or modes belong only to sensible sound, or SOUND in the  common acceptation of the word, but not to sound in the real and  philosophic sense; which, as I just now told you, is nothing but a  certain motion of the air?    PHIL.  It seems then there are two sorts of sound--the one vulgar, or  that which is heard, the other philosophical and real?    HYL.  Even so.    PHIL.  And the latter consists in motion?    HYL.  I told you so before.    PHIL.  Tell me, Hylas, to which of the senses, think you, the idea of  motion belongs? to the hearing?    HYL.  No, certainly; but to the sight and touch.    PHIL.  It should follow then, that, according to you, real sounds may  possibly be SEEN OR FELT, but never HEARD.    HYL.  Look you, Philonous, you may, if you please, make a jest of my  opinion, but that will not alter the truth of things. I own, indeed, the  inferences you draw me into sound something oddly; but common language,  you know, is framed by, and for the use of the vulgar: we must not  therefore wonder if expressions adapted to exact philosophic notions seem  uncouth and out of the way.    PHIL.  Is it come to that? I assure you, I imagine myself to have gained  no small point, since you make so light of departing from common phrases  and opinions; it being a main part of our inquiry, to examine whose  notions are widest of the common road, and most repugnant to the  general sense of the world. But, can you think it no more than a  philosophical paradox, to say that REAL SOUNDS ARE NEVER HEARD, and  that the idea of them is obtained by some other sense? And is there  nothing in this contrary to nature and the truth of things?    HYL.  To deal ingenuously, I do not like it. And, after the concessions  already made, I had as well grant that sounds too have no real being  without the mind.    PHIL.  And I hope you will make no difficulty to acknowledge the same of  COLOURS.    HYL.  Pardon me: the case of colours is very different. Can anything be  plainer than that we see them on the objects?    PHIL.  The objects you speak of are, I suppose, corporeal Substances  existing without the mind?    HYL.  They are.    PHIL.  And have true and real colours inhering in them?    HYL.  Each visible object hath that colour which we see in it.    PHIL.  How! is there anything visible but what we perceive by sight?    HYL.  There is not.    PHIL.  And, do we perceive anything by sense which we do not perceive  immediately?    HYL.  How often must I be obliged to repeat the same thing? I tell you,  we do not.    PHIL.  Have patience, good Hylas; and tell me once more, whether there  is anything immediately perceived by the senses, except sensible  qualities. I know you asserted there was not; but I would now be  informed, whether you still persist in the same opinion.    HYL.  I do.    PHIL.  Pray, is your corporeal substance either a sensible quality, or  made up of sensible qualities?    HYL.  What a question that is! who ever thought it was?    PHIL.  My reason for asking was, because in saying, EACH VISIBLE OBJECT  HATH THAT COLOUR WHICH WE SEE IN IT, you make visible objects to be  corporeal substances; which implies either that corporeal substances are  sensible qualities, or else that there is something besides sensible  qualities perceived by sight: but, as this point was formerly agreed  between us, and is still maintained by you, it is a clear consequence,  that your CORPOREAL SUBSTANCE is nothing distinct from SENSIBLE  QUALITIES.    HYL.  You may draw as many absurd consequences as you please, and  endeavour to perplex the plainest things; but you shall never persuade me  out of my senses. I clearly understand my own meaning.    PHIL.  I wish you would make me understand it too. But, since you are  unwilling to have your notion of corporeal substance examined, I shall  urge that point no farther. Only be pleased to let me know, whether the  same colours which we see exist in external bodies, or some other.    HYL.  The very same.    PHIL.  What! are then the beautiful red and purple we see on yonder  clouds really in them? Or do you imagine they have in themselves any  other form than that of a dark mist or vapour?    HYL.  I must own, Philonous, those colours are not really in the clouds  as they seem to be at this distance. They are only apparent colours.    PHIL.  APPARENT call you them? how shall we distinguish these apparent  colours from real?    HYL.  Very easily. Those are to be thought apparent which, appearing  only at a distance, vanish upon a nearer approach.    PHIL.  And those, I suppose, are to be thought real which are discovered  by the most near and exact survey.    HYL.  Right.    PHIL.  Is the nearest and exactest survey made by the help of a  microscope, or by the naked eye?    HYL.  By a microscope, doubtless.    PHIL.  But a microscope often discovers colours in an object different  from those perceived by the unassisted sight. And, in case we had  microscopes magnifying to any assigned degree, it is certain that no  object whatsoever, viewed through them, would appear in the same colour  which it exhibits to the naked eye.    HYL.  And what will you conclude from all this? You cannot argue that  there are really and naturally no colours on objects: because by  artificial managements they may be altered, or made to vanish.    PHIL.  I think it may evidently be concluded from your own concessions,  that all the colours we see with our naked eyes are only apparent as  those on the clouds, since they vanish upon a more close and accurate  inspection which is afforded us by a microscope.

She had on a trailing morning wrapper of white  muslin with cherry ribbons, but there was a pin doing duty  for a button in one or two places and the lace was hanging  off a bit at the sleeve.    \"Meg, dear, you're very untidy, you know, and Judy's absolutely  hopeless.\"    Meg was attired in an unbecoming green cashmere, with the elbows  out and the plush torn off in several places, while Judy's  exceedingly scant and faded pink zephyr had rents in several  places, and the colour was hardly to be seen for fruit-stains.    Meg coloured a little.  \"I know, Esther, and I'd like to be  nicely-dressed as well as anyone, but it really isn't worth  mending these old things.\"    She picked up her book about the elegant girls who were  disturbing her serenity and went over to the armchair with it.    \"Well, Judy, you go and sew up those rents, and put some buttons  on your frock.\"  Esther spoke with unusual determination.    Judy's eyes snapped and sparkled.    \"'Is that a dagger that I see before me, the handle to my hand?  Come, let me grasp it,'\" she said saucily, snatching one of the  pins from Esther's dress, fastening her own with it, and dropping  a curtsey.    Esther reddened a little now.    \"That's the General, Judy: he always pulls the buttons off my  wrappers when I play with him.  But I'm forgetting.  Children,  I have bad news for you.\"    There was a breathless silence.  Everyone crowded round her knees.    \"Sentence has been proclaimed,\" said Judy dramatically: \"let us  shave our heads and don sackcloth.\"    \"Your father says he cannot allow such conduct to go unpunished,  especially as you have all been unusually tiresome lately;  therefore: you are all--\"    \"To be taken away and hanged by the neck until we are dead!\"    \"Be quiet, Judy.  I have tried my best to beg you off, but it  only makes him more vexed.  He says you are the untidiest, most  unruly lot of children in Sydney, and he will punish you each time  you do anything, and--\"    \"There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\"    \"Oh, shut up, Judy!  Can't you let us hear?\"  Pip put his hand  over her mouth and held her by the hair while Esther told the  news.    \"None of you are to go to the pantomime.  The seats were taken for  Thursday night, and now, you very foolish children, you will all  have to stay at home.\"    There was a perfect howl of dismay for a minute or two.  They had  all been looking forward to this treat for nearly a month, and the  disappointment was a really bitter one to them all.    \"Oh, I say, Esther, that's too bad, really!  All the fellows at  school have been.\"  Pip's handsome face flushed angrily.  \"And for  such a little thing, too!\"    \"Just because you had roast fowl for dinner,\" said Judy, in a  half-choked voice.  \"Oh, Esther, why couldn't you have had cow,  or horse, or hippopotamus--anything but roast fowl?\"    \"Couldn't you get round him, Esther?\"  Meg looked anxiously at  her.    \"Dear Esther, do!\"    \"Oh, you sweet, beautiful Essie, do try!\"    They clung round her eagerly.  Baby flung her arms round her neck  and nearly choked her; Nell stroked her cheek; Pip patted her  back, and besought her to \"be a good fellow\"; Bunty buried his  nose in her back hair and wept a silent tear; Meg clasped her hand  in an access of unhappiness; the General gave a series of delighted  squeaks; and Judy in her wretchedness smacked him for his pains.    Esther would do her best, beg as she had never done before, coax,  beseech, wheedle, threaten; and they let her go at last with that  assurance.    \"Only I'd advise you all to be preternaturally good and quiet  all day,\" she said, looking back from the doorway.  \"That would  have most effect with him, and he is going to be at home all day.\"    GOOD!  It was absolutely painful to witness the virtue of those  children for the rest of the day.    It was holiday-time, and Miss Marsh was away, but not once did  the sound of quarrelling, or laughing, or crying fly down  to the lower regions.    \"'Citizens of Rome, the eyes of the world are upon you!'\"  Judy had said solemnly, and all had promised so to conduct  themselves that their father's heart could not fail to be melted.    Pip put on his school jacket, brushed his hair, took a pile of  school books, and proceeded to the study where his father was  writing letters, and where he was allowed to do his home-lessons.    \"Well, what do you want?\" said the Captain, with a frown.  \"No,  it's no good coming to the about that pup, sir--I won't have you  keep it.\"    \"I came to study, sir,\" said Pip mildly.  \"I feel I'm a bit  backward with my mathematics, so I won't waste all the holidays,  when I'm costing you so much in school fees.\"    The Captain gave a little gasp and looked hard at Pip; but the  boy's face was so unsmiling and earnest that he was disarmed,  and actually congratulated himself that his eldest son was at  last seeing the error of his ways.    \"There are those sets of problems in that drawer that I did when  I was at school,\" he said graciously.  \"If they are of any use  to you, you can get them out.\"    \"Thanks awfully--they will be a great help,\" said Pip gratefully.    He examined them with admiration plainly depicted upon his face.    \"How very clearly and correctly you worked, Father,\" he said  with a sigh.  \"I wonder if ever I'll get as good as this!  How  old were you, Father, when you did them?\"    \"About your age,\" said the Captain, picking up the papers.    He examined them with his head on one side.  He was rather proud  of them, seeing he had utterly forgotten now how to work decimal  fractions, and could not have done a quadratic equation to save his  life.    \"Still, I don't think you need be quite discouraged, Pip.  I was  rather beyond the other boys in my class in these subjects, I  remember.  We can't all excel in the same thing, and I'm glad to  see you are beginning to realize the importance of work.\"    \"Yes, Father.\"    Meg had betaken herself to the drawing-room, and was sitting on the  floor before the music canterbury with scissors, thimble, and a  roll of narrow blue ribbon on her knee, and all her father's songs,  that he so often complained were falling to pieces, spread out  before her.    He saw her once as he passed the door, and looked surprised and  pleased.    \"Thank you, Margaret: they wanted it badly.  I am glad you can  make yourself useful, after all,\" he said.    \"Yes, Father.\"    Meg stitched on industriously.    He went back to his study, where Pip's head was at a studious,  absorbed angle, and pyramids of books and sheaves of paper were  on the table.  He wrote two more letters, and there came a little  knock at the door.    \"Come in,\" he called; and there entered Nell.    She was carrying very carefully a little tray covered with a  snow-white doyley, and on it were a glass of milk and a plate  of mulberries.  She placed it before him.    \"I thought perhaps you would like a little lunch, Father,\" she  said gently; and Pip was seized with a sudden coughing fit.    \"My DEAR child!\" he said.    He looked at it very thoughtfully.    \"The last glass of milk I had, Nellie, was when I was Pip's age,  and was Barlow's fag at Rugby.  It made me ill, and I have never  touched it since.\"    \"But this won't hurt you.  You will drink this?\"  She gave him one  of her most beautiful looks.    \"I would as soon drink the water the maids wash up in, my child.\"  He took a mulberry, ate it, and made a wry face.  \"They're not  fit to eat.\"    \"After you've eaten about six you don't notice they're sour,\"  she said eagerly.  But he pushed them away.    \"I'll take your word for it.\"  Then he looked at her curiously.  \"What made you think of bringing me anything, Nellie?  I don't  ever remember you doing so before.\"    \"I thought you might be hungry writing here so long,\" she said  gently; and Pip choked again badly, and she withdrew.    Outside in the blazing sunshine Judy was mowing the lawn.    They only kept one man, and, as his time was so taken up with the  horses and stable work generally, the garden was allowed to fall  into neglect.  More than once the Captain had spoken vexedly of  the untidy lawns, and said he was ashamed for visitors to come to  the house.    So Judy, brimming over with zeal, armed herself with an abnormally  large scythe, and set to work on the long, long grass.    \"Good heavens, Helen! you'll cut your legs off!\" called her  father, in an agitated tone.    He had stepped out on to the front veranda for a mild cigar after  the mulberry just as she brought her scythe round with an  admirable sweep and decapitated a whole army of yellow-helmeted  dandelions.    She turned and gave him a beautiful smile.  \"Oh, no, Father!--why,  I'm quite a dab at mowing.\"    She gave it another alarming but truly scientific sweep.    \"See that--and th-a-at--and tha-a-a-at!\"    \"Th-a-at\" carried off a fragment of her dress, and \"tha-a-a-at\"  switched off the top of a rose-bush; but there are details to  everything, of course.    \"Accidents WILL happen, even to the best regulated grass-cutters,\"  she said composedly, and raising the scythe for a fresh circle.    \"Stop immediately, Helen!  Why ever can't you go and play quietly  with your doll, and not do things like this?\" said her father  irascibly.    \"An' I was afther doin' it just to pleasure him,\" she said,  apparently addressing the dandelions.    \"Well, it won't 'pleasure him' to have to provide you with cork  legs and re-stock the garden,\" he said dryly: \"Put it down.\"    \"Sure, an' it's illigence itsilf this side: you wouldn't be  afther leaving half undone, like a man with only one cheek shaved.\"    Judy affected an Irish brogue at intervals, for some occult reason of her own.    \"Sure an' if ye'd jist stip down and examine it yirself, it's  quite aisy ye'd be in yer moind.\"    The Captain hid a slight smile in"]]]
