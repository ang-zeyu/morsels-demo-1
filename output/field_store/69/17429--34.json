Titanic: Its Story and Its Lessons (#3)"],[1,"the dock with a snorting tug at its  heels, for all the world like a small boy dragging a diminutive puppy  down the road with its teeth locked on a piece of rope, its feet  splayed out, its head and body shaking from side to side in the effort  to get every ounce of its weight used to the best advantage. At first  all appearance showed that the sterns of the two vessels would  collide; but from the stern bridge of the Titanic an officer directing  operations stopped us dead, the suction ceased, and the New York with  her tug trailing behind moved obliquely down the dock, her stern  gliding along the side of the Titanic some few yards away. It gave an  extraordinary impression of the absolute helplessness of a big liner  in the absence of any motive power to guide her. But all excitement  was not yet over: the New York turned her bows inward towards the  quay, her stern swinging just clear of and passing in front of our  bows, and moved slowly head on for the Teutonic lying moored to the  side; mats were quickly got out and so deadened the force of the  collision, which from where we were seemed to be too slight to cause  any damage. Another tug came up and took hold of the New York by the  bows; and between the two of them they dragged her round the corner of  the quay which just here came to an end on the side of the river.    We now moved slowly ahead and passed the Teutonic at a creeping pace,  but notwithstanding this, the latter strained at her ropes so much  that she heeled over several degrees in her efforts to follow the  Titanic: the crowd were shouted back, a group of gold-braided  officials, probably the harbour-master and his staff, standing on the  sea side of the moored ropes, jumped back over them as they drew up  taut to a rigid line, and urged the crowd back still farther. But we  were just clear, and as we slowly turned the corner into the river I  saw the Teutonic swing slowly back into her normal station, relieving  the tension alike of the ropes and of the minds of all who witnessed  the incident.    [Illustration: FOUR DECKS OF OLYMPIC, SISTER SHIP OF TITANIC]    Unpleasant as this incident was, it was interesting to all the  passengers leaning over the rails to see the means adopted by the  officers and crew of the various vessels to avoid collision, to see on  the Titanic's docking-bridge (at the stern) an officer and seamen  telephoning and ringing bells, hauling up and down little red and  white flags, as danger of collision alternately threatened and  diminished. No one was more interested than a young American  kinematograph photographer, who, with his wife, followed the whole  scene with eager eyes, turning the handle of his camera with the most  evident pleasure as he recorded the unexpected incident on his films.  It was obviously quite a windfall for him to have been on board at  such a time. But neither the film nor those who exposed it reached the  other side, and the record of the accident from the Titanic's deck has  never been thrown on the screen.    As we steamed down the river, the scene we had just witnessed was the  topic of every conversation: the comparison with the Olympic-Hawke  collision was drawn in every little group of passengers, and it seemed  to be generally agreed that this would confirm the suction theory  which was so successfully advanced by the cruiser Hawke in the law  courts, but which many people scoffed at when the British Admiralty  first suggested it as the explanation of the cruiser ramming the  Olympic. And since this is an attempt to chronicle facts as they  happened on board the Titanic, it must be recorded that there were  among the passengers and such of the crew as were heard to speak on  the matter, the direst misgivings at the incident we had just  witnessed. Sailors are proverbially superstitious; far too many people  are prone to follow their lead, or, indeed, the lead of any one who  asserts a statement with an air of conviction and the opportunity of  constant repetition; the sense of mystery that shrouds a prophetic  utterance, particularly if it be an ominous one (for so constituted  apparently is the human mind that it will receive the impress of an  evil prophecy far more readily than it will that of a beneficent one,  possibly through subservient fear to the thing it dreads, possibly  through the degraded, morbid attraction which the sense of evil has  for the innate evil in the human mind), leads many people to pay a  certain respect to superstitious theories. Not that they wholly  believe in them or would wish their dearest friends to know they ever  gave them a second thought; but the feeling that other people do so  and the half conviction that there \"may be something in it, after  all,\" sways them into tacit obedience to the most absurd and childish  theories. I wish in a later chapter to discuss the subject of  superstition in its reference to our life on board the Titanic, but  will anticipate events here a little by relating a second so-called  \"bad omen\" which was hatched at Queenstown. As one of the tenders  containing passengers and mails neared the Titanic, some of those on  board gazed up at the liner towering above them, and saw a stoker's  head, black from his work in the stokehold below, peering out at them  from the top of one of the enormous funnels--a dummy one for  ventilation--that rose many feet above the highest deck. He had  climbed up inside for a joke, but to some of those who saw him there  the sight was seed for the growth of an \"omen,\" which bore fruit in an  unknown dread of dangers to come. An American lady--may she forgive me  if she reads these lines!--has related to me with the deepest  conviction and earnestness of manner that she saw the man and  attributes the sinking of the Titanic largely to that. Arrant  foolishness, you may say! Yes, indeed, but not to those who believe in  it; and it is well not to have such prophetic thoughts of danger  passed round among passengers and crew: it would seem to have an  unhealthy influence.    We dropped down Spithead, past the shores of the Isle of Wight looking  superbly beautiful in new spring foliage, exchanged salutes with a  White Star tug lying-to in wait for one of their liners inward bound,  and saw in the distance several warships with attendant black  destroyers guarding the entrance from the sea. In the calmest weather  we made Cherbourg just as it grew dusk and left again about 8.30,  after taking on board passengers and mails. We reached Queenstown  about 12 noon on Thursday, after a most enjoyable passage across the  Channel, although the wind was almost too cold to allow of sitting out  on deck on Thursday morning.    The coast of Ireland looked very beautiful as we approached Queenstown  Harbour, the brilliant morning sun showing up the green hillsides and  picking out groups of dwellings dotted here and there above the rugged  grey cliffs that fringed the coast. We took on board our pilot, ran  slowly towards the harbour with the sounding-line dropping all the  time, and came to a stop well out to sea, with our screws churning up  the bottom and turning the sea all brown with sand from below. It had  seemed to me that the ship stopped rather suddenly, and in my  ignorance of the depth of the harbour entrance, that perhaps the  sounding-line had revealed a smaller depth than was thought safe for  the great size of the Titanic: this seemed to be confirmed by the  sight of sand churned up from the bottom--but this is mere  supposition. Passengers and mails were put on board from two tenders,  and nothing could have given us a better idea of the enormous length  and bulk of the Titanic than to stand as far astern as possible and  look over the side from the top deck, forwards and downwards to where  the tenders rolled at her bows, the merest cockleshells beside the  majestic vessel that rose deck after deck above them. Truly she was a  magnificent boat! There was something so graceful in her movement as  she rode up and down on the slight swell in the harbour, a slow,  stately dip and recover, only noticeable by watching her bows in  comparison with some landmark on the coast in the near distance; the  two little tenders tossing up and down like corks beside her  illustrated vividly the advance made in comfort of motion from the  time of the small steamer.    Presently the work of transfer was ended, the tenders cast off, and at  1.30 P.M., with the screws churning up the sea bottom again, the  Titanic turned slowly through a quarter-circle until her nose pointed  down along the Irish coast, and then steamed rapidly away from  Queenstown, the little house on the left of the town gleaming white on  the hillside for many miles astern. In our wake soared and screamed  hundreds of gulls, which had quarrelled and fought over the remnants  of lunch pouring out of the waste pipes as we lay-to in the harbour  entrance; and now they followed us in the expectation of further  spoil. I watched them for a long time and was astonished at the ease  with which they soared and kept up with the ship with hardly a motion  of their wings: picking out a particular gull, I would keep him under  observation for minutes at a time and see no motion of his wings  downwards or upwards to aid his flight. He would tilt all of a piece  to one side or another as the gusts of wind caught him: rigidly  unbendable, as an aeroplane tilts sideways in a puff of wind. And yet  with graceful ease he kept pace with the Titanic forging through the  water at twenty knots: as the wind met him he would rise upwards and  obliquely forwards, and come down slantingly again, his wings curved  in a beautiful arch and his tail feathers outspread as a fan. It was  plain that he was possessed of a secret we are only just beginning to  learn--that of utilizing air-currents as escalators up and down which  he can glide at will with the expenditure of the minimum amount of  energy, or of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6677"],[0,"Seventy-Five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes and Sweetmeats, (#3)"],[1,"    Three ounces and a half of fresh butter.    The whites only of six eggs.    A table-spoonful of wine and brandy mixed.    Half a tea-spoonful of rose-water.    Break up a cocoa-nut, and take the thin brown skin carefully off,  with a knife. Wash all the pieces in cold water, and then wipe  them dry, with a clean towel. Weigh a quarter of a pound of  cocoa-nut, and grate it very fine, into a soup-plate.    Stir the butter and sugar to a cream, and add the liquor and  rose-water gradually to them.    Beat the whites only, of six eggs, till they stand alone on the  rods; and then stir the beaten white of egg, gradually, into the  butter and sugar. Afterwards, sprinkle in, by degrees, the grated  cocoa-nut, stirring hard all the time. Then stir all very well at  the last.    Have ready a puff-paste, sufficient to cover the bottom, sides,  and edges of a soup-plate. Put in the mixture, and bake it in a  moderate oven, about half an hour.    Grate loaf-sugar over it, when cool.      ALMOND PUDDING.      Half a pound of sweet almonds, which will be reduced to a quarter      of a pound, when shelled and blanched.    An ounce of blanched bitter almonds or peach-kernels.    The whites only, of six eggs.    A quarter of a pound of butter.    A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.    A table-spoonful of mixed brandy, wine, and rose-water.    Shell half a pound of sweet almonds, and pour scalding water over  them, which will make the skins peal off. As they get cool, pour  more boiling water, till the almonds are all blanched. Blanch also  the bitter almonds. As you blanch the almonds, throw them into a  bowl of cold water. Then take them out, one by one, wipe them dry  in a clean towel, and lay them on a plate. Pound them one at a  time to a fine paste, in a marble mortar, adding, as you pound  them, a few drops of rose-water to prevent their oiling. Pound the  bitter and sweet almonds alternately, that they may be well mixed.  They must be made perfectly fine and smooth, and are the better  for being prepared the day before they are wanted for the pudding.    Stir the butter and sugar to a cream, and add to it, gradually,  the liquor.    Beat the whites of six eggs till they stand alone. Stir the  almonds and white of eggs, alternately, into the butter and sugar;  and then stir the whole well together.    Have ready a puff-paste sufficient for a soup-plate. Butter the  plate, lay on the paste, trim and notch it. Then put in the  mixture.    Bake it about half an hour in a moderate oven.    Grate loaf-sugar over it.      A CHEESECAKE.      Four eggs.    A gill of milk.    A quarter of a pound of butter.    A quarter of a pound of powdered sugar.    Two ounces of grated bread.    A table-spoonful of mixed brandy and wine.    A tea-spoonful of rose-water.    A tea-spoonful of mace, cinnamon, and nutmeg, mixed.    A quarter of a pound of currants.    Pick the currants very clean. Wash them through a colander, wipe  them in a towel, and then dry them on a dish before the fire.    When dry take out a few to scatter over the top of the cheesecake,  lay them aside, and sprinkle the remainder of the currants with  the flour.    Stir the butter and sugar to a cream. Grate the bread, and prepare  the spice. Beat the eggs very light.    Boil the milk. When it comes to a boil, add to it half the beaten  egg, and boil both together till it becomes a curd, stirring it  frequently with a knife. Then throw the grated bread on the curd,  and stir all together. Then take the milk, egg, and bread off the  fire and stir it, gradually, into the butter and sugar. Next, stir  in the remaining half of the egg.    Add, by degrees, the liquor and spice.    Lastly, stir in, gradually, the currants.    Have ready a puff-paste, which should be made before you prepare  the cheesecake, as the mixture will become heavy by standing.  Before you put it into the oven, scatter the remainder of the  currants over the top.    Bake it half an hour in rather a quick oven.    Do not sugar the top.    You may bake it either in a soup-plate, or in two small tin  patty-pans, which, for cheesecakes, should be of a square shape.  If baked in square patty-pans, leave at each side a flap of paste  in the shape of a half-circle. Cut long slits in these flaps and  turn them over, so that they will rest on the top of the mixture.    You can, if you choose, add to the currants a few raisins stoned,  and cut in half.      SWEET POTATO PUDDING.      A quarter of a pound of boiled sweet potato.    Three eggs.    A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.    A quarter of a pound of fresh butter.    A glass of mixed wine and brandy.    A half-glass of rose-water.    A tea-spoonful of mixed spice, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon.    Pound the spice, allowing a smaller proportion of mace than of  nutmeg and cinnamon.    Boil and peal some sweet potatoes, and when they are cold, weigh a  quarter of a pound. Mash the sweet potato very smooth, and rub it  through a sieve. Stir the sugar and butter to a cream.    Beat the eggs very light, and stir them into the butter and sugar,  alternately with the sweet potato. Add by degrees the liquor,  rose-water and spice. Stir all very hard together.    Spread puff-paste on a soup-plate. Put in the mixture, and bake it  about half an hour in a moderate oven.    Grate sugar over it.      PUMPKIN PUDDING.      Half a pound of stewed pumpkin.    Three eggs.    A quarter of a pound of fresh butter, or a pint of cream.    A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.    Half a glass of wine and brandy mixed.    Half a glass of rose-water.    A tea-spoonful of mixed spice, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon.    Stew some pumpkin with as little water as possible. Drain it in a  colander, and press it till dry. When cold, weigh half a pound,  and pass it through a sieve. Prepare the spice. Stir together the  sugar, and butter, to cream, till they are perfectly light. Add to  them, gradually, the spice and liquor.    Beat three eggs very light, and stir them into the butter and  sugar alternately with the pumpkin.    Cover a soup-plate with puff-paste, and put in the mixture. Bake  it in a moderate oven about half an hour.    Grate sugar over it when cool.    Instead of the butter, you may boil a pint of milk or cream, and  when cold, stir into it in turn the sugar, eggs, and pumpkin.      GOOSEBERRY PUDDING.      A pint of stewed gooseberries, with all their juice.    A quarter of a pound of powdered sugar.    Two ounces of fresh butter.    Two ounces of grated bread.    Three eggs.    Stew the gooseberries till quite soft. When they are cold, mash  them fine with the back of a spoon, and stir into them two ounces  of sugar. Take two ounces more of sugar, and stir it to a cream  with two ounces of butter.    Grate very fine as much stale bread as will weigh two ounces.    Beat three eggs, and stir them into the butter and sugar, in turn  with the gooseberries and bread.    Lay puff-paste in a soup plate. Put in the mixture, and bake it  half an hour.    Do not grate sugar over it.      BAKED APPLE PUDDING.      A pint of stewed apples.    Half a pint of cream, or two ounces of butter.    A quarter of a pound of powdered sugar.    A nutmeg grated.    A table-spoonful of rose-water.    A tea-spoonful of grated lemon-peel.    Stew your apple in as little water as possible, and not long  enough for the pieces to break and lose their shape. Put them in a  colander to drain, and mash them with the back of a spoon. If  stewed too long, and in too much water, they will lose their  flavour. When cold, mix with them the nutmeg, rose-water, and  lemon-peel, and two ounces of sugar. Stir the other two ounces of  sugar, with the butter or cream, and then mix it gradually with  the apple.    Bake, it in puff-paste, in a soup-dish, about half an hour in a  moderate oven.    Do not sugar the top.      FRUIT PIES.    Fruit pies for family use, are generally made with common paste,  allowing three quarters of a pound of butter to a pound and a half  of flour.    Peaches and plums for pies, should be cut in half, and the stones  taken out. Cherries also should be stoned, and red cherries only  should be used for pies.    Apples should be cut into very thin slices, and are much improved  by a little lemon peel. Sweet apples are not good for pies, as  they are very insipid when baked, and seldom get thoroughly done.  If green apples are used, they should first be stewed in as little  water as possible; and made very sweet.    Apples, stewed previous to baking, should not be done till they  break, but only till they are tender. They should then be drained  in a colander, and chopped fine with a knife or the edge of a  spoon.    In making pies of juicy fruit, it is a good way to set a small  tea-cup on the bottom crust, and lay the fruit all round it. The  juice will collect under the cup, and not run out at the edges or  top of the pie. The fruit should be mixed with a sufficient  quantity of sugar, and piled up in the middle, so as to make the  pie highest in the centre. The upper crust should be pricked with  a fork, or have a slit cut in the middle. The edges should be  nicely crimped with a knife.    Dried peaches, dried apples, and cranberries should be stewed with  a very little water, and allowed to get quite cold before they are  put into the pie. If stewed fruit is put in warm, it will make the  paste heavy.    If your pies are made in the form of shells, or without lids, the  fruit should always be stewed first, or it will not be sufficiently  done, as the shells (which should be of puff paste) must not  bake so long as covered pies.    Shells intended for sweetmeats, must be baked empty, and the fruit  put into them before they go to table.    Fruit pies with lids, should have loaf-sugar grated over them. If  they have been baked the day before, they should be warmed in the  stove, or near the fire, before they are sent to table, to soften  the crust, and make "]]]
