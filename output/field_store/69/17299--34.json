Again, if ammoniacal gas is reduced by a compressing force to  one-sixth of its volume, or carbonic acid is reduced to one  thirty-sixth, a portion of them loses entirely the form of a gas,  and becomes a liquid, which, when the pressure is withdrawn, assumes  again in an instant its gaseous state--another deviation from the  law of Marriotte.    Our process for reducing gases into fluids is of admirable  simplicity. A simple bent tube, or a reduction of temperature by  artificial means, have superseded the powerful compressing machines  of the early experimenters.    The cyanuret of mercury, when heated in an open glass tube, is  resolved into cyanogen gas and metallic mercury; if this substance  is heated in a tube hermetically sealed, the decomposition occurs as  before, but the gas, unable to escape, and shut up in a space  several hundred times smaller than it would occupy as gas under the  ordinary atmospheric pressure, becomes a fluid in that part of the  tube which is kept cool.    When sulphuric acid is poured upon limestone in an open vessel,  carbonic acid escapes with effervescence as a gas, but if the  decomposition is effected in a strong, close, and suitable vessel of  iron, we obtain the carbonic acid in the state of liquid. In this  manner it may be obtained in considerable quantities, even many  pounds weight. Carbonic acid is separated from other bodies with  which it is combined as a fluid under a pressure of thirty-six  atmospheres.    The curious properties of fluid carbonic acid are now generally  known. When a small quantity is permitted to escape into the  atmosphere, it assumes its gaseous state with extraordinary  rapidity, and deprives the remaining fluid of caloric so rapidly  that it congeals into a white crystalline mass like snow: at first,  indeed, it was thought to be really snow, but upon examination it  proved to be pure frozen carbonic acid. This solid, contrary to  expectation, exercises only a feeble pressure upon the surrounding  medium. The fluid acid inclosed in a glass tube rushes at once, when  opened, into a gaseous state, with an explosion which shatters the  tube into fragments; but solid carbonic acid can be handled without  producing any other effect than a feeling of intense cold. The  particles of the carbonic acid being so closely approximated in the  solid, the whole force of cohesive attraction (which in the fluid is  weak) becomes exerted, and opposes its tendency to assume its  gaseous state; but as it receives heat from surrounding bodies, it  passes into gas gradually and without violence. The transition of  solid carbonic acid into gas deprives all around it of caloric so  rapidly and to so great an extent, that a degree of cold is produced  immeasurably great, the greatest indeed known. Ten, twenty, or more  pounds weight of mercury, brought into contact with a mixture of  ether and solid carbonic acid, becomes in a few moments firm and  malleable. This, however, cannot be accomplished without  considerable danger. A melancholy accident occurred at Paris, which  will probably prevent for the future the formation of solid carbonic  acid in these large quantities, and deprive the next generation of  the gratification of witnessing these curious experiments. Just  before the commencement of the lecture in the Laboratory of the  Polytechnic School, an iron cylinder, two feet and a half long and  one foot in diameter, in which carbonic acid had been developed for  experiment before the class, burst, and its fragments were scattered  about with the most tremendous force; it cut off both the legs of  the assistant and killed him on the spot. This vessel, formed of the  strongest cast-iron, and shaped like a cannon, had often been  employed to exhibit experiments in the presence of the students. We  can scarcely think, without shuddering, of the dreadful calamity  such an explosion would have occasioned in a hall filled with  spectators.    When we had ascertained the fact of gases becoming fluid under the  influence of cold or pressure, a curious property possessed by  charcoal, that of absorbing gas to the extent of many times its  volume,--ten, twenty, or even as in the case of ammoniacal gas or  muriatic acid gas, eighty or ninety fold,--which had been long  known, no longer remained a mystery. Some gases are absorbed and  condensed within the pores of the charcoal, into a space several  hundred times smaller than they before occupied; and there is now no  doubt they there become fluid, or assume a solid state. As in a  thousand other instances, chemical action here supplants mechanical  forces. Adhesion or heterogeneous attraction, as it is termed,  acquired by this discovery a more extended meaning; it had never  before been thought of as a cause of change of state in matter; but  it is now evident that a gas adheres to the surface of a solid body  by the same force which condenses it into a liquid.    The smallest amount of a gas,--atmospheric air for instance,--can be  compressed into a space a thousand times smaller by mere mechanical  pressure, and then its bulk must be to the least measurable surface  of a solid body, as a grain of sand to a mountain. By the mere  effect of mass,--the force of gravity,--gaseous molecules are  attracted by solids and adhere to their surfaces; and when to this  physical force is added the feeblest chemical affinity, the  liquifiable gases cannot retain their gaseous state. The amount of  air condensed by these forces upon a square inch of surface is  certainly not measurable; but when a solid body, presenting several  hundred square feet of surface within the space of a cubic inch, is  brought into a limited volume of gas, we may understand why that  volume is diminished, why all gases without exception are absorbed.  A cubic inch of charcoal must have, at the lowest computation, a  surface of one hundred square feet. This property of absorbing gases  varies with different kinds of charcoal: it is possessed in a higher  degree by those containing the most pores, i.e. where the pores are  finer; and in a lower degree in the more spongy kinds, i.e. where  the pores are larger.    In this manner every porous body--rocks, stones, the clods of the  fields, &c.,--imbibe air, and therefore oxygen; the smallest solid  molecule is thus surrounded by its own atmosphere of condensed  oxygen; and if in their vicinity other bodies exist which have an  affinity for oxygen, a combination is effected. When, for instance,  carbon and hydrogen are thus present, they are converted into  nourishment for vegetables,--into carbonic acid and water. The  development of heat when air is imbibed, and the production of steam  when the earth is moistened by rain, are acknowledged to be  consequences of this condensation by the action of surfaces.    But the most remarkable and interesting case of this kind of action  is the imbibition of oxygen by metallic platinum. This metal, when  massive, is of a lustrous white colour, but it may be brought, by  separating it from its solutions, into so finely divided a state,  that its particles no longer reflect light, and it forms a powder as  black as soot. In this condition it absorbs eight hundred times its  volume of oxygen gas, and this oxygen must be contained within it in  a state of condensation very like that of fluid water.    When gases are thus condensed, i.e. their particles made to  approximate in this extraordinary manner, their properties can be  palpably shown. Their chemical actions become apparent as their  physical characteristic disappears. The latter consists in the  continual tendency of their particles to separate from each other;  and it is easy to imagine that this elasticity of gaseous bodies is  the principal impediment to the operation of their chemical force;  for this becomes more energetic as their particles approximate. In  that state in which they exist within the pores or upon the surface  of solid bodies, their repulsion ceases, and their whole chemical  action is exerted. Thus combinations which oxygen cannot enter into,  decompositions which it cannot effect while in the state of gas,  take place with the greatest facility in the pores of platinum  containing condensed oxygen. When a jet of hydrogen gas, for  instance, is thrown upon spongy platinum, it combines with the  oxygen condensed in the interior of the mass; at their point of  contact water is formed, and as the immediate consequence heat is  evolved; the platinum becomes red hot and the gas is inflamed. If we  interrupt the current of the gas, the pores of the platinum become  instantaneously filled again with oxygen; and the same phenomenon  can be repeated a second time, and so on interminably.    In finely pulverised platinum, and even in spongy platinum, we  therefore possess a perpetuum mobile--a mechanism like a watch which  runs out and winds itself up--a force which is never  exhausted--competent to produce effects of the most powerful kind,  and self-renewed ad infinitum.    Many phenomena, formerly inexplicable, are satisfactorily explained  by these recently discovered properties of porous bodies. The  metamorphosis of alcohol into acetic acid, by the process known as  the quick vinegar manufacture, depends upon principles, at a  knowledge of which we have arrived by a careful study of these  properties.          LETTER III      My dear Sir,    The manufacture of soda from common culinary salt, may be regarded  as the foundation of all our modern improvements in the domestic  arts; and we may take it as affording an excellent illustration of  the dependence of the various branches of human industry and  commerce upon each other, and their relation to chemistry.    Soda has been used from time immemorial in the manufacture of soap  and glass, two chemical productions which employ and keep in  circulation an immense amount of capital. The quantity of soap  consumed by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45303"],[0,"The Life of John Taylor (#3)"],[1,"lic?    Finally, to wander no further from the subject in hand, were the  religious leaders of the early part of the nineteenth century, educated  to the idea that revelation had ceased; that the voice of prophecy  was forever silenced; that the ministration of angels was ended; that  the miraculous powers of the Holy Ghost were done away; that the  ancient organization of the church was no longer needed; and further,  believing that God was a substance merely, without form, without a  body, or parts, or passions--were such men, filled with pride which  the learning of this world too often infuses into the hearts of those  who possess it--were such men qualified to stand at the head of, and  become the leading actors in, the Dispensation of the Fullness of  Times? A dispensation which was to be opened by the personal visitation  of the Father and the Son, followed by numerous visitations of angels,  the re-establishment of the church of Christ, with all its doctrines,  ordinances, priesthoods, powers, promises and blessings; and ending,  eventually, with the full restoration of the house of Israel and the  complete redemption of the earth and all its righteous inhabitants?    Such a work was too large, too high and too deep for minds filled with  false, sectarian ideas. Hence God chose His servants in these last  days from men whose minds were unwarped by false education, but men of  large capacity; possessing breadth and freedom of thought, of sanguine,  fearless temperament: children of nature were they, with consciences  unseared by worldly guile, and strangers to motives other than those  dictated by an honest purpose; and, withal, full of implicit confidence  in God--a confidence born of a living faith in the fact of Deity's  existence, and a consciousness of the rectitude of their own intentions  and lives.    It was these qualities which made the men whom the Prophet Joseph Smith  gathered about him, and who were his trusted counselors, remarkable;  and of that coterie of men there was not one who more completely  united in his own character all those qualities which made the group  remarkable than John Taylor. Nor was there one more devoted in his  friendship for the prophet, or more zealous in his efforts to spread  abroad the glad tidings that the gospel of the Son of God in its  fullness was restored to the earth to bless mankind. Neither was there  one whose experience was more varied, or whose life was more crowded  with thrilling events, or whose position in the Church was more exalted  than his. He proclaimed the gospel in many lands; and as the champion  of truth, stood ready to meet all who assailed it; and whether he  met his opponents in the forum, before a multitude steeped full of  prejudice against him, or in the columns of the public press, he was  equally successful in vanquishing them by his powerful statement of  the truth, backed by a peculiar ability to expose the weakness of his  opponent's position.    So prominent was the career of John Taylor in the Church, as a trusted  friend of the Prophet Joseph Smith, with whom he may be said to have  shared martyrdom; as a founder and editor of Church periodicals; as  a preacher of the gospel; as an apostle; as a pioneer of Utah; as a  legislator; and, finally, as President of the Church during one of  the most trying periods through which she has passed in her eventful  career, that the literature of the Church would be incomplete without  his history. And if the lives of her leading men be the history of the  Church, as some aver, then that history would be extremely imperfect if  the life of her third President in this dispensation were not written.    JOHN TAYLOR was born November 1st, 1808, in Milnthorpe, a small town  near the head of Morecombe Bay, and not far from Windemere, the  \"Queen of English Lakes,\" in the county of Westmoreland, England. His  father's name was James Taylor, whose forefathers for many generations  had lived on an estate known as Craig Gate, in Ackenthwaite. James  Taylor's mother was the second wife of his father, Edward Taylor. By  his first wife Edward Taylor had two sons and three daughters; by his  second wife, whose name was Elizabeth, he had one son, James, and three  daughters, named Mary, Jane and Agnes. Edward Taylor, the grandfather  of the subject of this writing, died before his son James was born;  and owing to the English law of primogeniture, the eldest son took  the estate and left the younger branches of the family to provide for  themselves as best they could.    Though James Taylor was deprived of any share of his father's estate,  he acquired a good English education, some proficiency in the Latin and  Greek languages, and the higher branches of mathematics. What he had  lost by an unjust law, in the sudden demise of his father, was made up  to him by the munificence of an uncle (on his mother's side), William  T. Moon, who bequeathed to him a small estate in Hale, Westmoreland.    John Taylor's mother's name was Agnes; her maiden name was also Taylor.  Her grandfather, Christopher Taylor, lived to be ninety-seven years  of age. His son John, father of Agnes, held an office in the excise  under government, from his first setting out in life to the age of  about sixty. He was between seventy and eighty when he died. The  maiden name of Agnes Taylor's mother was Whittington, a descendant of  the family made famous by Richard Whittington, the younger son of Sir  William Whittington. (Sir William died intestate shortly after his  son Richard was born; and this circumstance, under the English law  of primogeniture, left him without a fortune. Nothing discouraged by  this event, Richard went to London to engage in trade. He apprenticed  himself to a mercer and appears to have risen rapidly in the world. He  was made an alderman in the city of London, then high sheriff; thrice  was he chosen lord mayor of London, and afterwards was elected member  of parliament for the city. He stood in high favor with the king,  who conferred on him the honor of knighthood. He was diligent and  exceedingly prosperous in business, upright and liberal in character,  \"a virtuous and godly man, full of good works, and those famous,\" says  an old chronicler. In many respects he was considerably in advance of  his times and conferred a lustre on his family's name which will live  forever in English story. This illustrious man was born, as nearly as  may be ascertained, about 1360.)    To James and Agnes Taylor were born ten children--eight sons and two  daughters. Three of the sons died while young. John Taylor was the  second son, but as his eldest brother, Edward, died at the age of  twenty-two, John stood next to his father, the head of the family.    John Taylor's father had received an appointment under government in  the excise, and the nature of his office was such that he had to move  from place to place. In 1819, however, he left government employ and  removed from Liverpool, where he had lived five years, and settled on  his estate in Hale.        CHAPTER II.    BOYHOOD--EARLY SURROUNDINGS--TRADE--SPIRITUAL MANIFESTATIONS--A STORM  AT SEA.    John Taylor was eleven years old when his father settled on his estate  in Hale. He attended school at Beetham, about a mile from Hale, and  only a few miles south of his birth place. It was in these boyhood days  at home that he got \"mixed up,\" as he puts it, \"with ploughing, sowing,  reaping, hay-making and other farm work; and I have indelibly impressed  on my mind,\" he continues, \"some of my first mishaps in horsemanship  in the way of sundry curious evolutions between the horses' backs and  _terra firma_.\"    At the age of fourteen he was bound an apprentice to a cooper, in  Liverpool. In about twelve months his employer failed and young Taylor  returned home. He afterwards went to learn the business of turner  in Penrith, Cumberland. Penrith is situated near the middle of a  beautiful, fertile valley sloping northwesterly to the Solway firth,  and drained by the Eden river; the valley because of its rare scenery,  is called the Vale of Eden. It is one of the most romantic districts  in all England. On the east is the Pennine range of mountains, which  in this locality attain their greatest altitude. On the west is the  Cumbrian group, where the highest summits in England are found. The  highest mountain is Scawfell, the loftiest of whose four peaks is 3,229  feet above the sea. A little to the east of this, and hence nearer  Penrith, is Mount Helvellyn 3,118 feet; and to the north Skiddaw 3,058  feet.    Nestling at the feet, or in basins between these mountain peaks, are  the most famous lakes in England, fifteen in number, varying in size  from one mile to ten in length, and from one-third to one mile in  width. Ulleswater is the lake nearest to Penrith, and while it has  little of the soft beauty that has made Lake Windemere famous, its  rugged surroundings and especially Mount Helvellyn at its south west  extremity, give to it a grandeur that verges on sublimity.    The climate of this lake region is very damp, and on the higher  mountain peaks snow lies for six and in some seasons even eight months  in the year. The excessive rain-fall, however, gives great freshness  and luxuriance to vegetation.    Besides the beauty and grandeur of the surrounding country, Penrith and  vicinity are rich in historical associations and monuments of a past  civilization. Lying near the Scotch border it was frequently invaded by  that hardy race during their unhappy conflicts with England; the town  was well nigh destroyed by them in the time of Edward III.; and was  again sacked in the time of Richard III.    In the immediate vicinity are a number of Druidical remains, among  which is the great Druidic monument Long Meg, a monolith eighteen feet  high and fifteen feet in circumference; while about her, in a circle  one hundred and fifty yards in diameter, are sixty-six"]]]
