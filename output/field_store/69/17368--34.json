Not a man to be easily  startled--not easily turned from a purpose, this, thought Ransford as  he glanced at Bryce's eyes, which had a trick of fastening their gaze on  people with an odd, disconcerting persistency.    \"I'm sorry to say what I must say,\" he began. \"But--you've brought it on  yourself. I gave you a hint some time ago that your attentions were not  welcome to Miss Bewery.\"    Bryce made no immediate response. Instead, leaning almost carelessly and  indifferently against the table at which he had been busy with drugs  and bottles, he took a small file from his waistcoat pocket and began to  polish his carefully cut nails.    \"Yes?\" he said, after a pause. \"Well?\"    \"In spite of it,\" continued Ransford, \"you've since addressed her again  on the matter--not merely once, but twice.\"    Bryce put his file away, and thrusting his hands in his pockets,  crossed his feet as he leaned back against the table--his whole attitude  suggesting, whether meaningly or not, that he was very much at his ease.    \"There's a great deal to be said on a point like this,\" he observed. \"If  a man wishes a certain young woman to become his wife, what right has  any other man--or the young woman herself, for that matter to say that  he mustn't express his desires to her?\"    \"None,\" said Ransford, \"provided he only does it once--and takes the  answer he gets as final.\"    \"I disagree with you entirely,\" retorted Bryce. \"On the last particular,  at any rate. A man who considers any word of a woman's as being final is  a fool. What a woman thinks on Monday she's almost dead certain not to  think on Tuesday. The whole history of human relationship is on my side  there. It's no opinion--it's a fact.\"    Ransford stared at this frank remark, and Bryce went on, coolly and  imperturbably, as if he had been discussing a medical problem.    \"A man who takes a woman's first answer as final,\" he continued, \"is, I  repeat, a fool. There are lots of reasons why a woman shouldn't know  her own mind at the first time of asking. She may be too surprised. She  mayn't be quite decided. She may say one thing when she really means  another. That often happens. She isn't much better equipped at the  second time of asking. And there are women--young ones--who aren't  really certain of themselves at the third time. All that's common  sense.\"    \"I'll tell you what it is!\" suddenly exclaimed Ransford, after remaining  silent for a moment under this flow of philosophy. \"I'm not going to  discuss theories and ideas. I know one young woman, at any rate, who  is certain of herself. Miss Bewery does not feel any inclination to  you--now, nor at any time to be! She's told you so three times. And--you  should take her answer and behave yourself accordingly!\"    Bryce favoured his senior with a searching look.    \"How does Miss Bewery know that she mayn't be inclined to--in the  future?\" he asked. \"She may come to regard me with favour.\"    \"No, she won't!\" declared Ransford. \"Better hear the truth, and be done  with it. She doesn't like you--and she doesn't want to, either. Why  can't you take your answer like a man?\"    \"What's your conception of a man?\" asked Bryce.    \"That!--and a good one,\" exclaimed Ransford.    \"May satisfy you--but not me,\" said Bryce. \"Mine's different. My  conception of a man is of a being who's got some perseverance. You can  get anything in this world--anything!--by pegging away for it.\"    \"You're not going to get my ward,\" suddenly said Ransford. \"That's flat!  She doesn't want you--and she's now said so three times. And--I support  her.\"    \"What have you against me?\" asked Bryce calmly. \"If, as you say, you  support her in her resolution not to listen to my proposals, you must  have something against me. What is it?\"    \"That's a question you've no right to put,\" replied Ransford, \"for it's  utterly unnecessary. So I'm not going to answer it. I've nothing against  you as regards your work--nothing! I'm willing to give you an excellent  testimonial.\"    \"Oh!\" remarked Bryce quietly. \"That means--you wish me to go away?\"    \"I certainly think it would be best,\" said Ransford.    \"In that case,\" continued Bryce, more coolly than ever, \"I shall  certainly want to know what you have against me--or what Miss Bewery has  against me. Why am I objected to as a suitor? You, at any rate, know  who I am--you know that my father is of our own profession, and a man  of reputation and standing, and that I myself came to you on high  recommendation. Looked at from my standpoint, I'm a thoroughly eligible  young man. And there's a point you forget--there's no mystery about me!\"    Ransford turned sharply in his chair as he noticed the emphasis which  Bryce put on his last word.    \"What do you mean?\" he demanded.    \"What I've just said,\" replied Bryce. \"There's no mystery attaching to  me. Any question about me can be answered. Now, you can't say that as  regards your ward. That's a fact, Dr. Ransford.\"    Ransford, in years gone by, had practised himself in the art of  restraining his temper--naturally a somewhat quick one. And he made  a strong effort in that direction now, recognizing that there was  something behind his assistant's last remark, and that Bryce meant him  to know it was there.    \"I'll repeat what I've just said,\" he answered. \"What do you mean by  that?\"    \"I hear things,\" said Bryce. \"People will talk--even a doctor can't  refuse to hear what gossiping and garrulous patients say. Since she  came to you from school, a year ago, Wrychester people have been much  interested in Miss Bewery, and in her brother, too. And there are a good  many residents of the Close--you know their nice, inquisitive ways!--who  want to know who the sister and brother really are--and what your  relationship is to them!\"    \"Confound their impudence!\" growled Ransford.    \"By all means,\" agreed Bryce. \"And--for all I care--let them be  confounded, too. But if you imagine that the choice and select coteries  of a cathedral town, consisting mainly of the relicts of deceased  deans, canons, prebendaries and the like, and of maiden aunts, elderly  spinsters, and tea-table-haunting curates, are free from gossip--why,  you're a singularly innocent person!\"    \"They'd better not begin gossiping about my affairs,\" said Ransford.  \"Otherwise--\"    \"You can't stop them from gossiping about your affairs,\" interrupted  Bryce cheerfully. \"Of course they gossip about your affairs; have  gossiped about them; will continue to gossip about them. It's human  nature!\"    \"You've heard them?\" asked Ransford, who was too vexed to keep back his  curiosity. \"You yourself?\"    \"As you are aware, I am often asked out to tea,\" replied Bryce, \"and  to garden-parties, and tennis-parties, and choice and cosy functions  patronized by curates and associated with crumpets. I have heard--with  these ears. I can even repeat the sort of thing I have heard.  'That dear, delightful Miss Bewery--what a charming girl! And that  good-looking boy, her brother--quite a dear! Now I wonder who they  really are? Wards of Dr. Ransford, of course! Really, how very  romantic!--and just a little--eh?--unusual? Such a comparatively young  man to have such a really charming girl as his ward! Can't be more than  forty-five himself, and she's twenty--how very, very romantic! Really,  one would think there ought to be a chaperon!'\"    \"Damn!\" said Ransford under his breath.    \"Just so,\" agreed Bryce. \"But--that's the sort of thing. Do you want  more? I can supply an unlimited quantity in the piece if you like. But  it's all according to sample.\"    \"So--in addition to your other qualities,\" remarked Ransford, \"you're a  gossiper?\"    Bryce smiled slowly and shook his head.    \"No,\" he replied. \"I'm a listener. A good one, too. But do you see my  point? I say--there's no mystery about me. If Miss Bewery will honour  me with her hand, she'll get a man whose antecedents will bear the  strictest investigation.\"    \"Are you inferring that hers won't?\" demanded Ransford.    \"I'm not inferring anything,\" said Bryce. \"I am speaking for myself, of  myself. Pressing my own claim, if you like, on you, the guardian. You  might do much worse than support my claims, Dr. Ransford.\"    \"Claims, man!\" retorted Ransford. \"You've got no claims! What are you  talking about? Claims!\"    \"My pretensions, then,\" answered Bryce. \"If there is a mystery--as  Wrychester people say there is--about Miss Bewery, it would be safe with  me. Whatever you may think, I'm a thoroughly dependable man--when it's  in my own interest.\"    \"And--when it isn't?\" asked Ransford. \"What are you then?--as you're so  candid.\"    \"I could be a very bad enemy,\" replied Bryce.    There was a moment's silence, during which the two men looked  attentively at each other.    \"I've told you the truth,\" said Ransford at last. \"Miss Bewery flatly  refuses to entertain any idea whatever of ever marrying you. She  earnestly hopes that that eventuality may never be mentioned to her  again. Will you give me your word of honour to respect her wishes?\"    \"No!\" answered Bryce. \"I won't!\"    \"Why not?\" asked Ransford, with a faint show of anger. \"A woman's  wishes!\"    \"Because I may consider that I see signs of a changed mind in her,\" said  Bryce. \"That's why.\"    \"You'll never see any change of mind,\" declared Ransford. \"That's  certain. Is that your fixed determination?\"    \"It is,\" answered Bryce. \"I'm not the sort of man who is easily  repelled.\"    \"Then, in that case,\" said Ransford, \"we had better part company.\" He  rose from his desk, and going over to a safe which stood in a corner,  unlocked it and took some papers from an inside drawer. He consulted  one of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#3)"],[1,"  of drawers--to hold clothes and such things, I suppose; on the other  side more bookshelves, a small table, and a little wicker easy  chair. Every possible inch of space seemed to be made useful in some  way, for a shelf or a hook or a hanging cupboard or something. Above  the stove was a neat little row of pots and dishes and cooking  usefuls. The raised skylight made it just possible to stand upright  in the centre aisle of the van; and a little sliding window opened  onto the driver's seat in front. Altogether it was a very neat  affair. The windows in front and back were curtained and a pot of  geraniums stood on a diminutive shelf. I was amused to see a sandy  Irish terrier curled up on a bright Mexican blanket in the bunk.    \"Miss McGill,\" he said, \"I couldn't sell Parnassus for less than  four hundred. I've put twice that much into her, one time and  another. She's built clean and solid all through, and there's  everything a man would need from blankets to bouillon cubes. The  whole thing's yours for $400--including dog, cook stove, and  everything--jib, boom, and spanker. There's a tent in a sling  underneath, and an ice box (he pulled up a little trap door under  the bunk) and a tank of coal oil and Lord knows what all. She's as  good as a yacht; but I'm tired of her. If you're so afraid of your  brother taking a fancy to her, why don't you buy her yourself and  go off on a lark? Make _him_ stay home and mind the farm!... Tell  you what I'll do. I'll start you on the road myself, come with you  the first day and show you how it's worked. You could have the time  of your life in this thing, and give yourself a fine vacation. It  would give your brother a good surprise, too. Why not?\"    I don't know whether it was the neatness of his absurd little van,  or the madness of the whole proposition, or just the desire to have  an adventure of my own and play a trick on Andrew, but anyway, some  extraordinary impulse seized me and I roared with laughter.    \"Right!\" I said. \"I'll do it.\"    I, Helen McGill, in the thirty-ninth year of my age!        CHAPTER THREE      \"Well,\" I thought, \"if I'm in for an adventure I may as well be spry  about it. Andrew'll be home by half-past twelve and if I'm going to  give him the slip I'd better get a start. I suppose he'll think I'm  crazy! He'll follow me, I guess. Well, he just shan't catch me,  that's all!\" A kind of anger came over me to think that I'd been  living on that farm for nearly fifteen years--yes, sir, ever since  I was twenty-five--and hardly ever been away except for that trip  to Boston once a year to go shopping with cousin Edie. I'm a  home-keeping soul, I guess, and I love my kitchen and my preserve  cupboard and my linen closet as well as grandmother ever did, but  something in that blue October air and that crazy little red-bearded  man just tickled me.    \"Look here, Mr. Parnassus,\" I said, \"I guess I'm a fat old fool but  I just believe I'll do that. You hitch up your horse and van and  I'll go pack some clothes and write you a check. It'll do Andrew all  the good in the world to have me skip. I'll get a chance to read a  few books, too. It'll be as good as going to college!\" And I untied  my apron and ran for the house. The little man stood leaning against  a corner of the van as if he were stupefied. I dare say he was.    I ran into the house through the front door, and it struck me as  comical to see a copy of one of Andrew's magazines lying on the  living-room table with \"The Revolt of Womanhood\" printed across  it in red letters. \"Here goes for the revolt of Helen McGill,\" I  thought. I sat down at Andrew's desk, pushed aside a pad of notes  he had been jotting down about \"the magic of autumn,\" and scrawled  a few lines:    DEAR ANDREW,    Don't be thinking I'm crazy. I've gone off for an adventure. It just  came over me that you've had all the adventures while I've been at  home baking bread. Mrs. McNally will look after your meals and one  of her girls can come over to do the housework. So don't worry. I'm  going off for a little while--a month, maybe--to see some of this  happiness and hayseed of yours. It's what the magazines call the  revolt of womanhood. Warm underwear in the cedar chest in the spare  room when you need it. With love, HELEN.    I left the note on his desk.    Mrs. McNally was bending over the tubs in the laundry. I could see  only the broad arch of her back and hear the vigorous zzzzzzz of her  rubbing. She straightened up at my call.    \"Mrs. McNally,\" I said, \"I'm going away for a little trip. You'd  better let the washing go until this afternoon and get Andrew's  dinner for him. He'll be back about twelve-thirty. It's half-past  ten now. You tell him I've gone over to see Mrs. Collins at Locust  Farm.\"    Mrs. McNally is a brawny, slow-witted Swede. \"All right Mis'  McGill,\" she said. \"You be back to denner?\"    \"No, I'm not coming back for a month,\" I said. \"I'm going away for  a trip. I want you to send Rosie over here every day to do the  housework while I'm away. You can arrange with Mr. McGill about  that. I've got to hurry now.\"    Mrs. McNally's honest eyes, as blue as Copenhagen china, gazing  through the window in perplexity, fell upon the travelling Parnassus  and Mr. Mifflin backing Pegasus into the shafts. I saw her make a  valiant effort to comprehend the sign painted on the side of the  van--and give it up.    \"You going driving?\" she said blankly.    \"Yes,\" I said, and fled upstairs.    I always keep my bank book in an old Huyler box in the top drawer  of my bureau. I don't save very quickly, I'm afraid. I have a  little income from some money father left me, but Andrew takes care  of that. Andrew pays all the farm expenses, but the housekeeping  accounts fall to me. I make a fairish amount of pin money on my  poultry and some of my preserves that I send to Boston, and on some  recipes of mine that I send to a woman's magazine now and then; but  generally my savings don't amount to much over $10 a month. In the  last five years I had put by something more than $600. I had been  saving up for a Ford. But just now it looked to me as if that  Parnassus would be more fun than a Ford ever could be. Four hundred  dollars was a lot of money, but I thought of what it would mean  to have Andrew come home and buy it. Why, he'd be away until  Thanksgiving! Whereas if I bought it I could take it away, have my  adventure, and sell it somewhere so that Andrew never need see it.  I hardened my heart and determined to give the Sage of Redfield  some of his own medicine.    My balance at the Redfield National Bank was $615.20. I sat down at  the table in my bedroom where I keep my accounts and wrote out a  check to Roger Mifflin for $400. I put in plenty of curlicues after  the figures so that no one could raise the check into $400,000; then  I got out my old rattan suit case and put in some clothes. The whole  business didn't take me ten minutes. I came downstairs to find Mrs.  McNally looking sourly at the Parnassus from the kitchen door.    \"You going away in that--that 'bus, Mis' McGill?\" she asked.    \"Yes, Mrs. McNally,\" I said cheerfully. Her use of the word gave me  an inspiration. \"That's one of the new jitney 'buses we hear about.  He's going to take me to the station. Don't you worry about me. I'm  going for a holiday. You get Mr. McGill's dinner ready for him.  After dinner tell him there's a note for him in the living-room.\"    \"I tank that bane a queer 'bus,\" said Mrs. McNally, puzzled. I think  the excellent woman suspected an elopement.    I carried my suit case out to the Parnassus. Pegasus stood placidly  between the shafts. From within came sounds of vigorous movement. In  a moment the little man burst out with a bulging portmanteau in his  hand. He had a tweed cap slanted on the back of his head.    \"There!\" he cried triumphantly. \"I've packed all my personal  effects--clothes and so on--and everything else goes with the  transaction. When I get on the train with this bag I'm a free man,  and hurrah for Brooklyn! Lord, won't I be glad to get back to the  city! I lived in Brooklyn once, and I haven't been back there for  ten years,\" he added plaintively.    \"Here's the check,\" I said, handing it to him. He flushed a little,  and looked at me rather shamefacedly. \"See here,\" he said, \"I hope  you're not making a bad bargain? I don't want to take advantage of a  lady. If you think your brother....\"    \"I was going to buy a Ford, anyway,\" I said, \"and it looks to me  as though this parcheesi of yours would be cheaper to run than any  flivver that ever came out of Detroit. I want to keep it away from  Andrew and that's the main thing. You give me a receipt and we'll  get away from here before he comes back.\"    He took the check without a word, hoisted his fat portmanteau on the  driver's seat, and then disappeared in the van. In a minute he  reappeared. On the back of one of his poetical cards he had written:    Received from Miss McGill the sum of four hundred dollars in  exchange for one Travelling Parnassus in first class condition,  delivered to her this day, October 3rd, 19--.    Signed  ROGER MIFFLIN.    \"Tell me,\" I said, \"does your Parnassus--_my_ Parnassus,  rather--contain everything I'm likely to need? Is it stocked up  with food and so on?\"    \"I was coming to that,\" he said. \"You'll find a fair supply of stuff  in the cupboard over the stove, though I used to get most of my  meals at farmhouses along the road. I generally read aloud to people  as I go along, and they're often good for a free meal. It's amazing  how little most of the country folk know about books, and how  pleased they are to hear good stuff. Down in Lancaster County,  Pennsylvania....\"    \"Well, how about the horse?\" I said hastily, seeing him about to  embark on an anecdote. It wasn't far short of eleven o'clock, and I  was anxious to get started.    \"It might be well to take along some oats. My supply's about"]]]
