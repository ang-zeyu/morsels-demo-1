The ladies' tastes were considered in  the profusion of flowers, and we each found an exquisite bouquet by our  plate. I cannot possibly give you a minute account of the whole menu; in  fact, as it is, I feel rather like Froissart, who, after chronicling a  long list of sumptuous dishes, is not ashamed to confess, \"Of all which  good things I, the chronicler of this narration, did partake!\" The soups  comprised kangaroo-tail--a clear soup not unlike ox-tail, but with a  flavour of game. I wish I could recollect the names of the fish: the  fresh-water ones came a long distance by rail from the river Murray, but  were excellent nevertheless. The last thing which I can remember tasting  (for one really could do little else) was a most exquisite morsel of  pigeon--more like a quail than anything else in flavour. I am not a  judge of wine, as you may imagine, therefore it is no unkindness to the  owners of the beautiful vineyards which we saw the other day, to  say that I do not like the Australian wines. Some of the gentlemen  pronounced them to be excellent, especially the equivalent to Sauterne,  which has a wonderful native name impossible to write down; but, as I  said before, I do not like the rather rough flavour. We had not a great  variety of fruit at dessert: indeed, Sydney oranges constituted its main  feature, as it is too late for winter fruits, and too early for summer  ones: but we were not inclined to be over-fastidious, and thought  everything delicious.          Letter III: On to New Zealand.      Christchurch, Canterbury, N. Z. October 14th, 1865. As you so  particularly desired me when we parted to tell you _everything_, I must  resume my story where in my last letter I left it off. If I remember  rightly, I ended with an attempt at describing our great feast. We  embarked the next day, and as soon as we were out of the bay the little  _Albion_ plunged into heavy seas. The motion was much worse in her  than on board the large vessel we had been so glad to leave, and all my  previous sufferings seemed insignificant compared with what I endured in  my small and wretchedly hard berth. I have a dim recollection of F----  helping me to dress, wrapping me up in various shawls, and half carrying  me up the companion ladder; I crawled into a sunny corner among the  boxes of oranges with which the deck was crowded, and there I lay  helpless and utterly miserable. One well-meaning and good-natured  fellow-passenger asked F---- if I was fond of birds, and on his saying  \"Yes,\" went off for a large wicker cage of hideous \"laughing Jackasses,\"  which he was taking as a great treasure to Canterbury. Why they  should be called \"Jackasses\" I never could discover; but the creatures  certainly do utter by fits and starts a sound which may fairly be  described as laughter. These paroxysms arise from no cause that one  can perceive; one bird begins, and all the others join in, and a more  doleful and depressing chorus I never heard: early in the morning seemed  the favourite time for this discordant mirth. Their owner also possessed  a cockatoo with a great musical reputation, but I never heard it get  beyond the first bar of \"Come into the garden, Maud.\" Ill as I was, I  remember being roused to something like a flicker of animation when  I was shown an exceedingly seedy and shabby-looking blackbird with  a broken leg in splints, which its master (the same bird-fancying  gentleman) assured me he had bought in Melbourne as a great bargain for  only 2 pounds 10 shillings!    After five days' steaming we arrived in the open roadstead of Hokitika,  on the west coast of the middle island of New Zealand, and five minutes  after the anchor was down a little tug came alongside to take away our  steerage passengers--three hundred diggers. The gold-fields on this  coast were only discovered eight months ago, and already several canvas  towns have sprung up; there are thirty thousand diggers at work, and  every vessel brings a fresh cargo of stalwart, sun-burnt men. It was  rather late, and getting dark, but still I could distinctly see the  picturesque tents in the deep mountain gorge, their white shapes dotted  here and there as far back from the shore as my sight could follow,  and the wreaths of smoke curling up in all directions from the evening  fires: it is still bitterly cold at night, being very early spring. The  river Hokitika washes down with every fresh such quantities of sand,  that a bar is continually forming in this roadstead, and though only  vessels of the least possible draught are engaged in the coasting-trade,  still wrecks are of frequent occurrence. We ought to have landed our  thousands of oranges here, but this work was necessarily deferred till  the morning, for it was as much as they could do to get all the diggers  and their belongings safely ashore before dark; in the middle of the  night one of the sudden and furious gales common to these seas sprang  up, and would soon have driven us on the rocks if we had not got our  steam up quickly and struggled out to sea, oranges and all, and away  to Nelson, on the north coast of the same island. Here we landed the  seventh day after leaving Melbourne, and spent a few hours wandering  about on shore. It is a lovely little town, as I saw it that spring  morning, with hills running down almost to the water's edge, and small  wooden houses with gables and verandahs, half buried in creepers, built  up the sides of the steep slopes. It was a true New Zealand day, still  and bright, a delicious invigorating freshness in the air, without  the least chill, the sky of a more than Italian blue, the ranges of  mountains in the distance covered with snow, and standing out, sharp and  clear against this lovely glowing heaven. The town itself, I must say,  seemed very dull and stagnant, with little sign of life or activity  about it; but nothing can be prettier or more picturesque than its  situation--not unlike that of a Swiss village. Our day came to an end  all too soon, and we re-embarked for Wellington, the most southern town  of the North Island. The seat of government is there, and it is supposed  to be a very thriving place, but is not nearly so well situated as  Nelson nor so attractive to strangers. We landed and walked about a good  deal, and saw what little there was to see. At first I thought the shops  very handsome, but I found, rather to my disgust, that generally the  fine, imposing frontage was all a sham; the actual building was only a  little but at the back, looking all the meaner for the contrast to the  cornices and show windows in front. You cannot think how odd it was to  turn a corner and see that the building was only one board in thickness,  and scarcely more substantial than the scenes at a theatre. We lunched  at the principal hotel, where F---- was much amused at my astonishment  at colonial prices. We had two dozen very nice little oysters, and he  had a glass of porter: for this modest repast we paid eleven shillings!    We slept on board, had another walk on shore after breakfast the  following morning, and about twelve o'clock set off for Lyttleton, the  final end of our voyaging, which we reached in about twenty hours.    The scenery is very beautiful all along the coast, but the navigation is  both dangerous and difficult. It was exceedingly cold, and Lyttleton  did not look very inviting; we could not get in at all near the  landing-place, and had to pay 2 pounds to be rowed ashore in an open  boat with our luggage. I assure you it was a very \"bad quarter of an  hour\" we passed in that boat; getting into it was difficult enough. The  spray dashed over us every minute, and by the time we landed we were  quite drenched, but a good fire at the hotel and a capital lunch soon  made us all right again; besides, in the delight of being actually at  the end of our voyage no annoyance or discomfort was worth a moment's  thought. F---- had a couple of hours' work rushing backwards and  forwards to the Custom House, clearing our luggage, and arranging for  some sort of conveyance to take us over the hills. The great tunnel  through these \"Port Hills\" (which divide Lyttleton from Christchurch,  the capital of Canterbury) is only half finished, but it seems wonderful  that so expensive and difficult an engineering work could be undertaken  by such an infant colony.    At last a sort of shabby waggonette was forthcoming, and about three  o'clock we started from Lyttleton, and almost immediately began to  ascend the zig-zag. It was a tremendous pull for the poor horses,  who however never flinched; at the steepest pinch the gentlemen were  requested to get out and walk, which they did, and at length we reached  the top. It was worth all the bad road to look down on the land-locked  bay, with the little patches of cultivation, a few houses nestling in  pretty recesses. The town of Lyttleton seemed much more imposing and  important as we rose above it: fifteen years ago a few sheds received  the \"Pilgrims,\" as the first comers are always called. I like the name;  it is so pretty and suggestive. By the way, I am told that these four  ships, sent out with the pilgrims by the Canterbury Association, sailed  together from England, parted company almost directly, and arrived in  Lyttleton (then called Port Cooper) four months afterwards, on the same  day, having all experienced fine weather, but never having sighted each  other once.    As soon as we reached the top of the hill the driver looked to the  harness of his horses, put on a very powerful double break, and we began  the descent, which, I must say, I thought we took much too quickly,  especially as at every turn of the road some little anecdote was  forthcoming of an upset or accident; however, I would not show the  least"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/611"],[0,"Prester John (#3)"],[1,"though he was he was not six yards behind me, and  I could see the white of his eyes and the red of his gums.  I saw  something else--a glint of white metal in his hand.  He still had his  knife.    Fear sent me up the rocks like a seagull, and I scrambled and leaped,  making for the corner I knew of.  Something told me that the pursuit  was slackening, and for a moment I halted to look round.  A second time  a halt was nearly the end of me. A great stone flew through the air,  and took the cliff an inch from my head, half-blinding me with  splinters.  And now I began to get angry.  I pulled myself into cover,  skirted a rock till I came to my corner, and looked back for the enemy.  There he was scrambling by the way I had come, and making a prodigious  clatter among the stones.  I picked up a loose bit of rock and hurled  it with all my force in his direction.  It broke before it reached him,  but a considerable lump, to my joy, took him full in the face.  Then my  terrors revived.  I slipped behind the waterfall and was soon in the  thicket, and toiling towards the top.    I think this last bit was the worst in the race, for my strength was  failing, and I seemed to hear those horrid steps at my heels.  My heart  was in my mouth as, careless of my best clothes, I tore through the  hawthorn bushes.  Then I struck the path and, to my relief, came on  Archie and Tam, who were running slowly in desperate anxiety about my  fate.  We then took hands and soon reached the top of the gully.    For a second we looked back.  The pursuit had ceased, and far down the  burn we could hear the sounds as of some one going back to the sands.    'Your face is bleeding, Davie.  Did he get near enough to hit you?'  Archie asked.    'He hit me with a stone.  But I gave him better.  He's got a bleeding  nose to remember this night by.'    We did not dare take the road by the links, but made for the nearest  human habitation.  This was a farm about half a mile inland, and when  we reached it we lay down by the stack-yard gate and panted.    'I've lost my lantern,' said Tam.  'The big black brute!  See if I  don't tell my father.'    'Ye'll do nothing of the kind,' said Archie fiercely.  'He knows  nothing about us and can't do us any harm.  But if the story got out  and he found out who we were, he'd murder the lot of US.'    He made us swear secrecy, which we were willing enough to do, seeing  very clearly the sense in his argument.  Then we struck the highroad  and trotted back at our best pace to Kirkcaple, fear of our families  gradually ousting fear of pursuit. In our excitement Archie and I  forgot about our Sabbath hats, reposing quietly below a whin bush on  the links.    We were not destined to escape without detection.  As ill luck would  have it, Mr Murdoch had been taken ill with the stomach-ache after the  second psalm, and the congregation had been abruptly dispersed.  My  mother had waited for me at the church door, and, seeing no signs of  her son, had searched the gallery.  Then the truth came out, and, had I  been only for a mild walk on the links, retribution would have  overtaken my truantry.  But to add to this I arrived home with a  scratched face, no hat, and several rents in my best trousers.  I was  well cuffed and sent to bed, with the promise of full-dress  chastisement when my father should come home in the morning.    My father arrived before breakfast next day, and I was duly and soundly  whipped.  I set out for school with aching bones to add to the usual  depression of Monday morning.  At the corner of the Nethergate I fell  in with Archie, who was staring at a trap carrying two men which was  coming down the street. It was the Free Church minister--he had married  a rich wife and kept a horse--driving the preacher of yesterday to the  railway station.  Archie and I were in behind a doorpost in a  twinkling, so that we could see in safety the last of our enemy. He was  dressed in minister's clothes, with a heavy fur-coat and a brand new  yellow-leather Gladstone bag.  He was talking loudly as he passed, and  the Free Church minister seemed to be listening attentively.  I heard  his deep voice saying something about the 'work of God in this place.'  But what I noticed specially--and the sight made me forget my aching  hinder parts--was that he had a swollen eye, and two strips of  sticking-plaster on his cheek.        CHAPTER II    FURTH! FORTUNE!    In this plain story of mine there will be so many wild doings ere the  end is reached, that I beg my reader's assent to a prosaic digression.  I will tell briefly the things which happened between my sight of the  man on the Kirkcaple sands and my voyage to Africa. I continued for  three years at the burgh school, where my progress was less notable in  my studies than in my sports.  One by one I saw my companions pass out  of idle boyhood and be set to professions.  Tam Dyke on two occasions  ran off to sea in the Dutch schooners which used to load with coal in  our port; and finally his father gave him his will, and he was  apprenticed to the merchant service.  Archie Leslie, who was a year my  elder, was destined for the law, so he left Kirkcaple for an Edinburgh  office, where he was also to take out classes at the college.  I  remained on at school till I sat alone by myself in the highest  class--a position of little dignity and deep loneliness.  I had grown a  tall, square-set lad, and my prowess at Rugby football was renowned  beyond the parishes of Kirkcaple and Portincross.  To my father I fear  I was a disappointment.  He had hoped for something in his son more  bookish and sedentary, more like his gentle, studious self.    On one thing I was determined: I should follow a learned profession.  The fear of being sent to an office, like so many of my schoolfellows,  inspired me to the little progress I ever made in my studies.  I chose  the ministry, not, I fear, out of any reverence for the sacred calling,  but because my father had followed it before me.  Accordingly I was  sent at the age of sixteen for a year's finishing at the High School of  Edinburgh, and the following winter began my Arts course at the  university.    If Fate had been kinder to me, I think I might have become a scholar.  At any rate I was just acquiring a taste for philosophy and the dead  languages when my father died suddenly of a paralytic shock, and I had  to set about earning a living.    My mother was left badly off, for my poor father had never been able to  save much from his modest stipend.  When all things were settled, it  turned out that she might reckon on an income of about fifty pounds a  year.  This was not enough to live on, however modest the household,  and certainly not enough to pay for the colleging of a son.  At this  point an uncle of hers stepped forward with a proposal.  He was a  well-to-do bachelor, alone in the world, and he invited my mother to  live with him and take care of his house.  For myself he proposed a  post in some mercantile concern, for he had much influence in the  circles of commerce.  There was nothing for it but to accept  gratefully.  We sold our few household goods, and moved to his gloomy  house in Dundas Street.  A few days later he announced at dinner that  he had found for me a chance which might lead to better things.    'You see, Davie,' he explained, 'you don't know the rudiments of  business life.  There's no house in the country that would take you in  except as a common clerk, and you would never earn much more than a  hundred pounds a year all your days.  If you want to better your future  you must go abroad, where white men are at a premium.  By the mercy of  Providence I met yesterday an old friend, Thomas Mackenzie, who was  seeing his lawyer about an estate he is bidding for.  He is the head of  one of the biggest trading and shipping concerns in the  world--Mackenzie, Mure, and Oldmeadows--you may have heard the name.  Among other things he has half the stores in South Africa, where they  sell everything from Bibles to fish-hooks.  Apparently they like men  from home to manage the stores, and to make a long story short, when I  put your case to him, he promised you a place.  I had a wire from him  this morning confirming the offer.  You are to be assistant storekeeper  at--' (my uncle fumbled in his pocket, and then read from the yellow  slip) 'at Blaauwildebeestefontein.  There's a mouthful for you.'    In this homely way I first heard of a place which was to be the theatre  of so many strange doings.    'It's a fine chance for you,' my uncle continued.  'You'll only be  assistant at first, but when you have learned your job you'll have a  store of your own.  Mackenzie's people will pay you three hundred  pounds a year, and when you get a store you'll get a percentage on  sales.  It lies with you to open up new trade among the natives.  I  hear that Blaauw--something or other, is in the far north of the  Transvaal, and I see from the map that it is in a wild, hilly country.  You may find gold or diamonds up there, and come back and buy  Portincross House.'  My uncle rubbed his hands and smiled cheerily.    Truth to tell I was both pleased and sad.  If a learned profession was  denied me I vastly preferred a veld store to an Edinburgh office stool.  Had I not been still under the shadow of my father's death I might have  welcomed the chance of new lands and new folk.  As it was, I felt the  loneliness of an exile. That afternoon I walked on the Braid Hills, and  when I saw in the clear spring sunlight the coast of Fife, and  remembered Kirkcaple and my boyish days, I could have found it in me to  sit down and cry.    A fortnight later I sailed.  My mother bade me a tearful farewell, and  my uncle, besides buying me an outfit and paying my passage money, gave  me a present of twenty sovereigns. 'You'll not be your mother's son,  Davie,' were his last words, 'if you don't come home with it multiplied  by a"]]]
