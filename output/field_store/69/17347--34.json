At home he would pore diligently over the queer  pictures and charts in his grandfather's books, while Old Whateley  would instruct and catechize him through long, hushed afternoons. By  this time the restoration of the house was finished, and those who  watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a  solid plank door. It was a window in the rear of the east gable end,  close against the hill; and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden  runway was built up to it from the ground. About the period of this  work's completion people noticed that the old tool-house, tightly  locked and windowlessly clapboarded since Wilbur's birth, had been  abandoned again. The door swung listlessly open, and when Earl Sawyer  once stepped within after a cattle-selling call on Old Whateley he was  quite discomposed by the singular odor he encountered--such a stench,  he averred, as he had never before smelt in all his life except near  the Indian circles on the hills, and which could not come from anything  sane or of this earth. But then, the homes and sheds of Dunwich folk  have never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness.    The following months were void of visible events, save that everyone  swore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises. On  May Eve of 1915 there were tremors which even the Aylesbury people  felt, whilst the following Hallowe'en produced an underground rumbling  queerly synchronized with bursts of flame--\"them witch Whateleys'  doin's\"--from the summit of Sentinel Hill. Wilbur was growing up  uncannily, so that he looked like a boy of ten as he entered his  fourth year. He read avidly by himself now; but talked much less than  formerly. A settled taciturnity was absorbing him, and for the first  time people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in  his goatish face. He would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon, and  chant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener with a sense of  unexplainable terror. The aversion displayed toward him by dogs had now  become a matter of wide remark, and he was obliged to carry a pistol  in order to traverse the countryside in safety. His occasional use of  the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of canine  guardians.    The few callers at the house would often find Lavinia alone on the  ground floor, while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded-up  second story. She would never tell what her father and the boy were  doing up there, though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal  degree of fear when a jocose fish-peddler tried the locked door leading  to the stairway. That peddler told the store loungers at Dunwich  Village that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above.  The loungers reflected, thinking of the door and runway, and of  the cattle that so swiftly disappeared. Then they shuddered as they  recalled tales of Old Whateley's youth, and of the strange things that  are called out of the earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper  time to certain heathen gods. It had for some time been noticed that  dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole Whateley place as violently  as they hated and feared young Wilbur personally.    In 1917 the war came, and Squire Sawyer Whateley, as chairman of the  local draft board, had hard work finding a quota of young Dunwich men  fit even to be sent to a development camp. The government, alarmed at  such signs of wholesale regional decadence, sent several officers and  medical experts to investigate; conducting a survey which New England  newspaper readers may still recall. It was the publicity attending this  investigation which set reporters on the track of the Whateleys, and  caused the _Boston Globe_ and _Arkham Advertiser_ to print flamboyant  Sunday stories of young Wilbur's precociousness, Old Whateley's black  magic, the shelves of strange books, the sealed second story of the  ancient farmhouse, and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill  noises. Wilbur was four and a half then, and looked like a lad of  fifteen. His lip and cheek were fuzzy with a coarse dark down, and his  voice had begun to break. Earl Sawyer went out to the Whateley place  with both sets of reporters and camera men, and called their attention  to the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed  upper spaces. It was, he said, exactly like a smell he had found in the  tool-shed abandoned when the house was finally repaired, and like the  faint odors which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circles  on the mountains. Dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared, and  grinned over the obvious mistakes. They wondered, too, why the writers  made so much of the fact that Old Whateley always paid for his cattle  in gold pieces of extremely ancient date. The Whateleys had received  their visitors with ill-concealed distaste, though they did not dare  court further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talk.      4    For a decade the annals of the Whateleys sink indistinguishably into  the general life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and  hardened to their May Eve and All-Hallow orgies. Twice a year they  would light fires on the top of Sentinel Hill, at which times the  mountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence; while  at all seasons there were strange and portentous doings at the lonely  farmhouse. In the course of time callers professed to hear sounds  in the sealed upper story even when all the family were downstairs,  and they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock  was usually sacrificed. There was talk of a complaint to the Society  for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; but nothing ever came of  it, since Dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world's  attention to themselves.    About 1923, when Wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature,  and bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great  siege of carpentry went on at the old house. It was all inside the  sealed upper part, and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded  that the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions  and even removed the attic floor, leaving only one vast open void  between the ground story and the peaked roof. They had torn down the  great central chimney, too, and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy  outside tin stove-pipe.    In the spring after this event Old Whateley noticed the growing number  of whippoorwills that would come out of Cold Spring Glen to chirp under  his window at night. He seemed to regard the circumstance as one of  great significance, and told the loungers at Osborn's that he thought  his time had almost come.    \"They whistle jest in tune with my breathin' naow,\" he said, \"an' I  guess they're gittin' ready to ketch my soul. They know it's a-goin'  aout, an' dun't calc'late to miss it. Yew'll know, boys, arter I'm  gone, whether they git me er not. Ef they dew, they'll keep up  a-singin' an' laffin' till break o' day. Ef they dun't, they'll kinder  quiet daown like. I expeck them an' the souls they hunts fer hev some  pretty tough tussles sometimes.\"    On Lammas Night, 1924, Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury was hastily summoned  by Wilbur Whateley, who had lashed his one remaining horse through the  darkness and telephoned from Osborn's in the village. He found Old  Whateley in a very grave state, with a cardiac action and stertorous  breathing that told of an end not far off. The shapeless albino  daughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside, whilst from  the vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of  rhythmical surging or lapping, as of the waves on some level beach. The  doctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds  outside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their  endless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps  of the dying man. It was uncanny and unnatural--too much, thought Dr.  Houghton, like the whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in  response to the urgent call.    Toward 1 o'clock Old Whateley gained consciousness, and interrupted his  wheezing to choke out a few words to his grandson.    \"More space, Willy, more space soon. Yew grows--an' _that_ grows  faster. It'll be ready to sarve ye soon, boy. Open up the gates to  Yog-Sothoth with the long chant that ye'll find on page 751 _of the  complete edition_, an' _then_ put a match to the prison. Fire from  airth can't burn it nohaow!\"    He was obviously quite mad. After a pause, during which the flock of  whippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while  some indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off, he  added another sentence or two.    \"Feed it reg'lar, Willy, an' mind the quantity; but dun't let it grow  too fast fer the place, fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye  opens to Yog-Sothoth, it's all over an' no use. Only them from beyont  kin make it multiply an' work.... Only them, the old uns as wants to  come back....\"    But speech gave place to gasps again, and Lavinia screamed at the  way the whippoorwills followed the change. It was the same for more  than an hour, when the final throaty rattle came. Dr. Houghton drew  shrunken lids over the glazing gray eyes as the tumult of birds faded  imperceptibly to silence. Lavinia sobbed, but Wilbur only chuckled  whilst the hill noises rumbled faintly.    \"They didn't git him,\" he muttered in his heavy bass voice.    Wilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in  his one-sided way, and was quietly known by correspondence to many  librarians in distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days  are kept. He was more and more hated and dreaded around Dunwich because  of certain youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his  door; but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/502"],[0,"Desert Gold (#3)"],[1,"the heart.  In an instant, when thoughts resurged like blinding  flashes of lightning through his mind, he was a swaying, quivering,  terror-stricken man.  He mumbled something hoarsely and backed into the  shadow.  But he need not have feared discovery, however surely his  agitation might have betrayed him.  Warren sat brooding over the  campfire, oblivious of his comrade, absorbed in the past.    Cameron swiftly walked away in the gloom, with the blood thrumming  thick in his ears, whispering over and over:    \"Merciful God!  Nell was his daughter!\"        III    As thought and feeling multiplied, Cameron was overwhelmed.  Beyond  belief, indeed, was it that out of the millions of men in the world two  who had never seen each other could have been driven into the desert by  memory of the same woman.  It brought the past so close.  It showed  Cameron how inevitably all his spiritual life was governed by what had  happened long ago.  That which made life significant to him was a  wandering in silent places where no eye could see him with his secret.  Some fateful chance had thrown him with the father of the girl he had  wrecked. It was incomprehensible; it was terrible.  It was the one  thing of all possible happenings in the world of chance that both  father and lover would have found unendurable.    Cameron's pain reached to despair when he felt this relation between  Warren and himself.  Something within him cried out to him to reveal  his identity.  Warren would kill him; but it was not fear of death that  put Cameron on the rack.  He had faced death too often to be afraid.  It was the thought of adding torture to this long-suffering man.  All  at once Cameron swore that he would not augment Warren's trouble, or  let him stain his hands with blood.  He would tell the truth of Nell's  sad story and his own, and make what amends he could.    Then Cameron's thought shifted from father to daughter.  She was  somewhere beyond the dim horizon line.  In those past lonely hours by  the campfire his fancy had tortured him with pictures of Nell. But his  remorseful and cruel fancy had lied to him.  Nell had struggled upward  out of menacing depths.  She had reconstructed a broken life.  And now  she was fighting for the name and happiness of her child.  Little Nell!  Cameron experienced a shuddering ripple in all his being--the physical  rack of an emotion born of a new and strange consciousness.    As Cameron gazed out over the blood-red, darkening desert suddenly the  strife in his soul ceased.  The moment was one of incalculable change,  in which his eyes seemed to pierce the vastness of cloud and range, and  mystery of gloom and shadow--to see with strong vision the illimitable  space before him.  He felt the grandeur of the desert, its simplicity,  its truth.  He had learned at last the lesson it taught.  No longer  strange was his meeting and wandering with Warren. Each had marched in  the steps of destiny; and as the lines of their fates had been  inextricably tangled in the years that were gone, so now their steps  had crossed and turned them toward one common goal.  For years they had  been two men marching alone, answering to an inward driving search, and  the desert had brought them together. For years they had wandered alone  in silence and solitude, where the sun burned white all day and the  stars burned white all night, blindly following the whisper of a  spirit.  But now Cameron knew that he was no longer blind, and in this  flash of revelation he felt that it had been given him to help Warren  with his burden.    He returned to camp trying to evolve a plan.  As always at that long  hour when the afterglow of sunset lingered in the west, Warren plodded  to and fro in the gloom.  All night Cameron lay awake thinking.    In the morning, when Warren brought the burros to camp and began  preparations for the usual packing, Cameron broke silence.    \"Pardner, your story last night made me think.  I want to tell you  something about myself.  It's hard enough to be driven by sorrow for  one you've loved, as you've been driven; but to suffer sleepless and  eternal remorse for the ruin of one you've loved as I have  suffered--that is hell....  Listen.  In my younger days--it seems long  now, yet it's not so many years--I was wild.  I wronged the sweetest  and loveliest girl I ever knew.  I went away not dreaming that any  disgrace might come to her.  Along about that time I fell into terrible  moods--I changed--I learned I really loved her.  Then came a letter I  should have gotten months before.  It told of her trouble--importuned  me to hurry to save her.  Half frantic with shame and fear, I got a  marriage certificate and rushed back to her town. She was gone--had  been gone for weeks, and her disgrace was known. Friends warned me to  keep out of reach of her father.  I trailed her--found her.  I married  her.  But too late!... She would not live with me. She left me--I  followed her west, but never found her.\"    Warren leaned forward a little and looked into Cameron's eyes, as if  searching there for the repentance that might make him less deserving  of a man's scorn.    Cameron met the gaze unflinchingly, and again began to speak:    \"You know, of course, how men out here somehow lose old names, old  identities.  It won't surprise you much to learn my name really isn't  Cameron, as I once told you.\"    Warren stiffened upright.  It seemed that there might have been a  blank, a suspension, between his grave interest and some strange mood  to come.    Cameron felt his heart bulge and contract in his breast; all his body  grew cold; and it took tremendous effort for him to make his lips form  words.    \"Warren, I'm the man you're hunting.  I'm Burton.  I was Nell's lover!\"    The old man rose and towered over Cameron, and then plunged down upon  him, and clutched at his throat with terrible stifling hands. The harsh  contact, the pain awakened Cameron to his peril before it was too late.  Desperate fighting saved him from being hurled to the ground and  stamped and crushed.  Warren seemed a maddened giant.  There was a  reeling, swaying, wrestling struggle before the elder man began to  weaken.  The Cameron, buffeted, bloody, half-stunned, panted for speech.    \"Warren--hold on!  Give me--a minute.  I married Nell.  Didn't you know  that?... I saved the child!\"    Cameron felt the shock that vibrated through Warren.  He repeated the  words again and again.  As if compelled by some resistless power,  Warren released Cameron, and, staggering back, stood with uplifted,  shaking hands.  In his face was a horrible darkness.    \"Warren!  Wait--listen!\" panted Cameron.  \"I've got that marriage  certificate--I've had it by me all these years.  I kept it--to prove to  myself I did right.\"    The old man uttered a broken cry.    Cameron stole off among the rocks.  How long he absented himself or  what he did he had no idea.  When he returned Warren was sitting before  the campfire, and once more he appeared composed.  He spoke, and his  voice had a deeper note; but otherwise he seemed as usual.    They packed the burros and faced the north together.    Cameron experienced a singular exaltation.  He had lightened his  comrade's burden.  Wonderfully it came to him that he had also  lightened his own.  From that hour it was not torment to think of Nell.  Walking with his comrade through the silent places, lying beside him  under the serene luminous light of the stars, Cameron began to feel the  haunting presence of invisible things that were real to him--phantoms  whispering peace.  In the moan of the cool wind, in the silken seep of  sifting sand, in the distant rumble of a slipping ledge, in the faint  rush of a shooting star he heard these phantoms of peace coming with  whispers of the long pain of men at the last made endurable.  Even in  the white noonday, under the burning sun, these phantoms came to be  real to him. In the dead silence of the midnight hours he heard them  breathing nearer on the desert wind--nature's voices of motherhood,  whispers of God, peace in the solitude.        IV    There came a morning when the sun shone angry and red through a dull,  smoky haze.    \"We're in for sandstorms,\" said Cameron.    They had scarcely covered a mile when a desert-wide, moaning, yellow  wall of flying sand swooped down upon them.  Seeking shelter in the lee  of a rock, they waited, hoping the storm was only a squall, such as  frequently whipped across the open places.  The moan increased to a  roar, and the dull red slowly dimmed, to disappear in the yellow pall,  and the air grew thick and dark.  Warren slipped the packs from the  burros.  Cameron feared the sandstorms had arrived some weeks ahead of  their usual season.    The men covered their heads and patiently waited.  The long hours  dragged, and the storm increased in fury.  Cameron and Warren wet  scarfs with water from their canteens, and bound them round their  faces, and then covered their heads.  The steady, hollow bellow of  flying sand went on.  It flew so thickly that enough sifted down under  the shelving rock to weight the blankets and almost bury the men.  They  were frequently compelled to shake off the sand to keep from being  borne to the ground.  And it was necessary to keep digging out the  packs.  The floor of their shelter gradually rose higher and higher.  They tried to eat, and seemed to be grinding only sand between their  teeth.  They lost the count of time. They dared not sleep, for that  would have meant being buried alive. The could only crouch close to the  leaning rock, shake off the sand, blindly dig out their packs, and  every moment gasp and cough and choke to fight suffocation.    The storm finally blew itself out.  It left the prospectors heavy and  stupid for want of sleep.  Their burros had wandered away, or had been  buried in the sand.  Far as eye could reach the desert had marvelously  changed; it was now a "]]]
