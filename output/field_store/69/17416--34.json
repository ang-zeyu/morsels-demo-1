If a wise man should appear in our village, he would create,  in those who conversed with him, a new consciousness of wealth, by  opening their eyes to unobserved advantages; he would establish a sense  of immovable equality, calm us with assurances that we could not be  cheated; as every one would discern the checks and guaranties of  condition. The rich would see their mistakes and poverty, the poor  their escapes and their resources.    But nature brings all this about in due time. Rotation is her remedy.  The soul is impatient of masters, and eager for change. Housekeepers  say of a domestic who has been valuable, \"She has lived with me long  enough.\" We are tendencies, or rather, symptoms, and none of us  complete. We touch and go, and sip the foam of many lives. Rotation  is the law of nature. When nature removes a great man, people explore  the horizon for a successor; but none comes and none will. His class  is extinguished with him. In some other and quite different field, the  next man will appear; not Jefferson, nor Franklin, but now a great  salesman; then a road-contractor; then a student of fishes; then a  buffalo-hunting explorer, or a semi-savage western general. Thus we  make a stand against our rougher masters; but against the best there  is a finer remedy. The power which they communicate is not theirs.  When we are exalted by ideas, we do not owe this to Plato, but to the  idea, to which, also, Plato was debtor.    I must not forget that we have a special debt to a single class. Life  is a scale of degrees. Between rank and rank of our great men are wide  intervals. Mankind have, in all ages, attached themselves to a few  persons, who, either by the quality of that idea they embodied, or by  the largeness of their reception, were entitled to the position of  leaders and law-givers. These teach us the qualities of primary  nature,--admit us to the constitution of things. We swim, day by day,  on a river of delusions, and are effectually amused with houses and  towns in the air, of which the men about us are dupes. But life is a  sincerity. In lucid intervals we say, \"Let there be an entrance opened  for me into realities; I have worn the fool's cap too long.\" We will  know the meaning of our economies and politics. Give us the cipher,  and, if persons and things are scores of a celestial music, let us  read off the strains. We have been cheated of our reason; yet there  have been sane men, who enjoyed a rich and related existence. What  they know, they know for us. With each new mind, a new secret of nature  transpires; nor can the Bible be closed, until the last great man is  born. These men correct the delirium of the animal spirits, make us  considerate, and engage us to new aims and powers. The veneration of  mankind selects these for the highest place. Witness the multitude of  statues, pictures, and memorials which recall their genius in every  city, village, house, and ship:--      \"Ever their phantoms arise before us.    Our loftier brothers, but one in blood;    At bed and table they lord it o'er us,    With looks of beauty, and words of good.\"    How to illustrate the distinctive benefit of ideas, the service rendered  by those who introduce moral truths into the general mind?--I am  plagued, in all my living, with a perpetual tariff of prices. If I  work in my garden, and prune an apple-tree, I am well enough  entertained, and could continue indefinitely in the like occupation.  But it comes to mind that a day is gone, and I have got this precious  nothing done. I go to Boston or New York, and run up and down on my  affairs: they are sped, but so is the day. I am vexed by the  recollection of this price I have paid for a trifling advantage. I  remember the _peau d'ane_, on which whoso sat should have his desire,  but a piece of the skin was gone for every wish. I go to a convention of  philanthropists. Do what I can, I cannot keep my eyes off the clock. But  if there should appear in the company some gentle soul who knows little  of persons or parties, of Carolina or Cuba, but who announces a law that  disposes these particulars, and so certifies me of the equity which  checkmates every false player, bankrupts every self-seeker, and apprises  me of my independence on any conditions of country, or time, or human  body, that man liberates me; I forget the clock.    I pass out of the sore relation to persons. I am healed of my hurts.  I am made immortal by apprehending my possession of incorruptible  goods. Here is great competition of rich and poor. We live in a market,  where is only so much wheat, or wool, or land; and if I have so much  more, every other must have so much less. I seem to have no good,  without breach of good manners. Nobody is glad in the gladness of  another, and our system is one of war, of an injurious superiority.  Every child of the Saxon race is educated to wish to be first. It is  our system; and a man comes to measure his greatness by the regrets,  envies, and hatreds of his competitors. But in these new fields there  is room: here are no self-esteems, no exclusions.    I admire great men of all classes, those who stand for facts, and for  thoughts; I like rough and smooth \"Scourges of God,\" and \"Darlings of  the human race.\" I like the first Caesar; and Charles V., of Spain;  and Charles XII., of Sweden; Richard Plantagenet; and Bonaparte, in  France. I applaud a sufficient man, an officer, equal to his office;  captains, ministers, senators. I like a master standing firm on legs  of iron, well-born, rich, handsome, eloquent, loaded with advantages,  drawing all men by fascination into tributaries and supporters of his  power. Sword and staff, or talents sword-like or staff-like, carry on  the work of the world. But I find him greater, when he can abolish  himself, and all heroes, by letting in this element of reason,  irrespective of persons; this subtilizer, and irresistible upward  force, into our thought, destroying individualism; the power so great,  that the potentate is nothing. Then he is a monarch, who gives a  constitution to his people; a pontiff, who preaches the equality of  souls, and releases his servants from their barbarous homages; an  emperor, who can spare his empire.    But I intended to specify, with a little minuteness, two or three  points of service. Nature never spares the opium or nepenthe; but  wherever she mars her creature with some deformity or defect, lays her  poppies plentifully on the bruise, and the sufferer goes joyfully  through life, ignorant of the ruin, and incapable of seeing it, though  all the world point their finger at it every day. The worthless and  offensive members of society, whose existence is a social pest,  invariably think themselves the most ill-used people alive, and never  get over their astonishment at the ingratitude and selfishness of their  contemporaries. Our globe discovers its hidden virtues, not only in  heroes and archangels, but in gossips and nurses. Is it not a rare  contrivance that lodged the due inertia in every creature, the  conserving, resisting energy, the anger at being waked or changed?  Altogether independent of the intellectual force in each, is the pride  of opinion, the security that we are right. Not the feeblest grandame,  not a mowing idiot, but uses what spark of perception and faculty is  left, to chuckle and triumph in his or her opinion over the absurdities  of all the rest. Difference from me is the measure of absurdity. Not  one has a misgiving of being wrong. Was it not a bright thought that  made things cohere with this bitumen, fastest of cements? But, in the  midst of this chuckle of self-gratulation, some figure goes by, which  Thersites too can love and admire. This is he that should marshal us  the way we were going. There is no end to his aid. Without Plato, we  should almost lose our faith in the possibility of a reasonable book.  We seem to want but one, but we want one. We love to associate with  heroic persons, since our receptivity is unlimited; and, with the  great, our thoughts and manners easily become great. We are all wise  in capacity, though so few in energy. There needs but one wise man in  a company, and all are wise, so rapid is the contagion.    Great men are thus a collyrium to clear our eyes from egotism, and  enable us to see other people and their works. But there are vices and  follies incident to whole populations and ages. Men resemble their  contemporaries, even more than their progenitors. It is observed in  old couples, or in persons who have been housemates for a course of  years, that they grow alike; and, if they should live long enough, we  should not be able to know them apart. Nature abhors these  complaisances, which threaten to melt the world into a lump, and hastens  to break up such maudlin agglutinations. The like assimilation goes  on between men of one town, of one sect, of one political party; and  the ideas of the time are in the air, and infect all who breathe it.  Viewed from any high point, the city of New York, yonder city of London,  the western civilization, would seem a bundle of insanities. We keep  each other in countenance, and exasperate by emulation the frenzy of  the time. The shield against the stingings of conscience, is the  universal practice, or our contemporaries. Again; it is very easy to  be as wise and good as your companions. We learn of our contemporaries,  what they know, without effort, and almost through the pores of the  skin. We catch it by sympathy, or, as a wife arrives at the intellectual  and moral elevations of her husband. But we stop where they stop. Very  hardly can we take another step. The great, or such as hold of nature,  and transcend fashions, by their fidelity to universal ideas, are  saviors from these federal errors, and defend us from our  contemporaries. They are the exceptions which we want, where all grows  alike. A foreign greatness is the antidote for cabalism."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6317"],[0,"Sailing Alone Around the World (#3)"],[1,"point the old  died or the new took birth, and it was no matter. The bulwarks I built  up of white-oak stanchions fourteen inches high, and covered with  seven-eighth-inch white pine. These stanchions, mortised through a  two-inch covering-board, I calked with thin cedar wedges. They have  remained perfectly tight ever since. The deck I made of  one-and-a-half-inch by three-inch white pine spiked to beams, six by  six inches, of yellow or Georgia pine, placed three feet apart. The  deck-inclosures were one over the aperture of the main hatch, six feet  by six, for a cooking-galley, and a trunk farther aft, about ten feet  by twelve, for a cabin. Both of these rose about three feet above the  deck, and were sunk sufficiently into the hold to afford head-room. In  the spaces along the sides of the cabin, under the deck, I arranged a  berth to sleep in, and shelves for small storage, not forgetting a  place for the medicine-chest. In the midship hold, that is, the space  between cabin and galley, under the deck, was room for provision of  water, salt beef, etc., ample for many months.    The hull of my vessel being now put together as strongly as wood and  iron could make her, and the various rooms partitioned off, I set  about \"calking ship.\" Grave fears were entertained by some that at  this point I should fail. I myself gave some thought to the  advisability of a \"professional calker.\" The very first blow I struck  on the cotton with the calking-iron, which I thought was right, many  others thought wrong. \"It'll crawl!\" cried a man from Marion, passing  with a basket of clams on his back. \"It'll crawl!\" cried another from  West Island, when he saw me driving cotton into the seams. Bruno  simply wagged his tail. Even Mr. Ben J----, a noted authority on  whaling-ships, whose mind, however, was said to totter, asked rather  confidently if I did not think \"it would crawl.\" \"How fast will it  crawl?\" cried my old captain friend, who had been towed by many a  lively sperm-whale. \"Tell us how fast,\" cried he, \"that we may get  into port in time.\"    [Illustration: \"'It'll crawl'\"]    However, I drove a thread of oakum on top of the cotton, as from the  first I had intended to do. And Bruno again wagged his tail. The  cotton never \"crawled.\" When the calking was finished, two coats of  copper paint were slapped on the bottom, two of white lead on the  topsides and bulwarks. The rudder was then shipped and painted, and on  the following day the _Spray_ was launched. As she rode at her  ancient, rust-eaten anchor, she sat on the water like a swan.    The _Spray's_ dimensions were, when finished, thirty-six feet nine  inches long, over all, fourteen feet two inches wide, and four feet  two inches deep in the hold, her tonnage being nine tons net and  twelve and seventy-one hundredths tons gross.    Then the mast, a smart New Hampshire spruce, was fitted, and likewise  all the small appurtenances necessary for a short cruise. Sails were  bent, and away she flew with my friend Captain Pierce and me, across  Buzzard's Bay on a trial-trip--all right. The only thing that now  worried my friends along the beach was, \"Will she pay?\" The cost of my  new vessel was $553.62 for materials, and thirteen months of my own  labor. I was several months more than that at Fairhaven, for I got  work now and then on an occasional whale-ship fitting farther down the  harbor, and that kept me the overtime.          CHAPTER II      Failure as a fisherman--A voyage around the world projected--From  Boston to Gloucester--Fitting out for the ocean voyage--Half of a dory  for a ship's boat--The run from Gloucester to Nova Scotia--A shaking  up in home waters--Among old friends.    I spent a season in my new craft fishing on the coast, only to find  that I had not the cunning properly to bait a hook. But at last the  time arrived to weigh anchor and get to sea in earnest. I had resolved  on a voyage around the world, and as the wind on the morning of April  24,1895, was fair, at noon I weighed anchor, set sail, and filled away  from Boston, where the _Spray_ had been moored snugly all winter. The  twelve-o'clock whistles were blowing just as the sloop shot ahead  under full sail. A short board was made up the harbor on the port  tack, then coming about she stood seaward, with her boom well off to  port, and swung past the ferries with lively heels. A photographer on  the outer pier at East Boston got a picture of her as she swept by,  her flag at the peak throwing its folds clear. A thrilling pulse beat  high in me. My step was light on deck in the crisp air. I felt that  there could be no turning back, and that I was engaging in an  adventure the meaning of which I thoroughly understood. I had taken  little advice from any one, for I had a right to my own opinions in  matters pertaining to the sea. That the best of sailors might do worse  than even I alone was borne in upon me not a league from Boston docks,  where a great steamship, fully manned, officered, and piloted, lay  stranded and broken. This was the _Venetian._ She was broken  completely in two over a ledge. So in the first hour of my lone voyage  I had proof that the _Spray_ could at least do better than this  full-handed steamship, for I was already farther on my voyage than  she. \"Take warning, _Spray,_ and have a care,\" I uttered aloud to my  bark, passing fairylike silently down the bay.    The wind freshened, and the _Spray_ rounded Deer Island light at the  rate of seven knots.    Passing it, she squared away direct for Gloucester to procure there  some fishermen's stores. Waves dancing joyously across Massachusetts  Bay met her coming out of the harbor to dash them into myriads of  sparkling gems that hung about her at every surge. The day was  perfect, the sunlight clear and strong. Every particle of water thrown  into the air became a gem, and the _Spray,_ bounding ahead, snatched  necklace after necklace from the sea, and as often threw them away. We  have all seen miniature rainbows about a ship's prow, but the _Spray_  flung out a bow of her own that day, such as I had never seen before.  Her good angel had embarked on the voyage; I so read it in the sea.    Bold Nahant was soon abeam, then Marblehead was put astern. Other  vessels were outward bound, but none of them passed the _Spray_ flying  along on her course. I heard the clanking of the dismal bell on  Norman's Woe as we went by; and the reef where the schooner _Hesperus_  struck I passed close aboard. The \"bones\" of a wreck tossed up lay  bleaching on the shore abreast. The wind still freshening, I settled  the throat of the mainsail to ease the sloop's helm, for I could  hardly hold her before it with the whole mainsail set. A schooner  ahead of me lowered all sail and ran into port under bare poles, the  wind being fair. As the _Spray_ brushed by the stranger, I saw that  some of his sails were gone, and much broken canvas hung in his  rigging, from the effects of a squall.    I made for the cove, a lovely branch of Gloucester's fine harbor,  again to look the _Spray_ over and again to weigh the voyage, and my  feelings, and all that. The bay was feather-white as my little vessel  tore in, smothered in foam. It was my first experience of coming into  port alone, with a craft of any size, and in among shipping. Old  fishermen ran down to the wharf for which the _Spray_ was heading,  apparently intent upon braining herself there. I hardly know how a  calamity was averted, but with my heart in my mouth, almost, I let go  the wheel, stepped quickly forward, and downed the jib. The sloop  naturally rounded in the wind, and just ranging ahead, laid her cheek  against a mooring-pile at the windward corner of the wharf, so  quietly, after all, that she would not have broken an egg. Very  leisurely I passed a rope around the post, and she was moored. Then a  cheer went up from the little crowd on the wharf. \"You couldn't 'a'  done it better,\" cried an old skipper, \"if you weighed a ton!\" Now, my  weight was rather less than the fifteenth part of a ton, but I said  nothing, only putting on a look of careless indifference to say for  me, \"Oh, that's nothing\"; for some of the ablest sailors in the world  were looking at me, and my wish was not to appear green, for I had a  mind to stay in Gloucester several days. Had I uttered a word it  surely would have betrayed me, for I was still quite nervous and short  of breath.    I remained in Gloucester about two weeks, fitting out with the various  articles for the voyage most readily obtained there. The owners of the  wharf where I lay, and of many fishing-vessels, put on board dry cod  galore, also a barrel of oil to calm the waves. They were old skippers  themselves, and took a great interest in the voyage. They also made  the _Spray_ a present of a \"fisherman's own\" lantern, which I found  would throw a light a great distance round. Indeed, a ship that would  run another down having such a good light aboard would be capable of  running into a light-ship. A gaff, a pugh, and a dip-net, all of which  an old fisherman declared I could not sail without, were also put  aboard. Then, top, from across the cove came a case of copper paint, a  famous antifouling article, which stood me in good stead long after. I  slapped two coats of this paint on the bottom of the _Spray_ while she  lay a tide or so on the hard beach.    For a boat to take along, I made shift to cut a castaway dory in two  athwartships, boarding up the end where it was cut. This half-dory I  could hoist in and out by the nose easily enough, by hooking the  throat-halyards into a strop fitted for the purpose. A whole dory  would be heavy and awkward to handle alone. Manifestly there was not  room on deck for more than the half of a boat, which, after all, was  better than no boat at all, and was large enough for one man. I  perceived, moreover, that the newly arranged craft would answer for a  washing-machine when"]]]
