The  color was also different, the delicately molded mouth being purple-red  instead of the approved cherry or coral hue; while the complexion was a  clear dark, and the color, which mantled the cheeks in moments of  excitement, was a dim or dusky rather than a rosy red.    The exquisite form and face of this young girl, from the first moment of  seeing her, produced a very deep impression; and I continued watching  her every movement and gesture with an intense, even a passionate  interest. She had a quantity of flowers in her hand; but these sweet  emblems, I observed, were all gayly colored, which seemed strange, for  in most places white flowers are used in funeral ceremonies. Some of the  men who had followed the body carried in their hands broad,  three-cornered bronze shovels, with short black handles, and these they  had dropped upon the grass on arriving at the grave. Presently the old  man stooped and drew the covering back from the dead one's face--a  rigid, marble-white face set in a loose mass of black hair. The others  gathered round, and some standing, others kneeling, bent on the still  countenance before them a long earnest gaze, as if taking an eternal  farewell of one they had deeply loved. At this moment the the beautiful  girl I have described all at once threw herself with a sobbing cry on  her knees before the corpse, and, stooping, kissed the face with  passionate grief. \"Oh, my beloved, must we now leave you alone forever!\"  she cried between the sobs that shook her whole frame. \"Oh, my love--my  love--my love, will you come back to us no more!\"    The others all appeared deeply affected at her grief, and presently a  young man standing by raised her from the ground and drew her gently  against his side, where for some minutes she continued convulsively  weeping. Some of the other men now passed ropes through the handles of  the straw mat on which the corpse rested, and raising it from the  platform lowered it into the foss. Each person in turn then advanced and  dropped some flowers into the grave, uttering the one word \"Farewell\" as  they did so; after which the loose earth was shoveled in with the bronze  implements. Over the mound the hurdle on which the straw mat had rested  was then placed, the dry brushwood and faggots heaped over it and  ignited with a coal from the brazier. White smoke and crackling flames  issued anon from the pile, and in a few moments the whole was in a  fierce blaze.    Standing around they all waited in silence until the fire had burnt  itself out; then the old man advancing stretched his arms above the  white and still smoking ashes and cried in a loud voice: \"Farewell  forever, O well beloved son! With deep sorrow and tears we have given  you back to Earth; but not until she has made the sweet grass and  flowers grow again on this spot, scorched and made desolate with fire,  shall our hearts be healed of their wound and forget their grief.\"              Chapter 2    The thrilling, pathetic tone in which these words were uttered affected  me not a little; and when the ceremony was over I continued staring  vacantly at the speaker, ignorant of the fact that the beautiful young  girl had her wide-open, startled eyes fixed on the bush which, I vainly  imagined, concealed me from view.    All at once she cried out: \"Oh, father, look there! Who is that  strange-looking man watching us from behind the bushes?\"    They all turned, and then I felt that fourteen or fifteen pairs of very  keen eyes were on me, seeing me very plainly indeed, for in my curiosity  and excitement I had come out from the thicker bushes to place myself  behind a ragged, almost leafless shrub, which afforded the merest  apology for a shelter. Putting a bold face on the matter, although I did  not feel very easy, I came out and advanced to them, removing my  battered old hat on the way, and bowing repeatedly to the assembled  company. My courteous salutation was not returned; but all, with  increasing astonishment pictured on their faces, continued staring at me  as if they were looking on some grotesque apparition. Thinking it best  to give an account of myself at once, and to apologize for intruding on  their mysteries, I addressed myself to the old man:    \"I really beg your pardon,\" I said, \"for having disturbed you at such an  inconvenient time, and while you are engaged in these--these solemn  rites; but I assure you, sir, it has been quite accidental. I happened  to be walking here when I saw you coming, and thought it best to step  out of the way until--well, until the funeral was over. The fact is, I  met with a serious accident in the mountains over there. I fell down  into a ravine, and a great heap of earth and stones fell on and stunned  me, and I do not know how long I lay there before I recovered my senses.  I daresay I am trespassing, but I am a perfect stranger here, and quite  lost, and--and perhaps a little confused after my fall, and perhaps you  will kindly tell me where to go to get some refreshment, and find out  where I am.\"    \"Your story is a very strange one,\" said the old man in reply, after a  pause of considerable duration. \"That you are a perfect stranger in this  place is evident from your appearance, your uncouth dress, and your  thick speech.\"    His words made me blush hotly, although I should not have minded his  very personal remarks much if that beautiful girl had not been standing  there listening to everything. My _uncouth_ garments, by the way,  were made by a fashionable West End tailor, and fitted me perfectly,  although just now they were, of course, very dirty. It was also a  surprise to hear that I had a _thick speech_, since I had always  been considered a remarkably clear speaker and good singer, and had  frequently both sung and recited in public, at amateur entertainments.    After a distressing interval of silence, during which they all continued  regarding me with unabated curiosity, the old gentleman condescended to  address me again and asked me my name and country.    \"My country,\" said I, with the natural pride of a Briton, \"is England,  and my name is Smith.\"    \"No such country is known to me,\" he returned; \"nor have I ever heard  such a name as yours.\"    I was rather taken aback at his words, and yet did not just then by any  means realize their full import. I was thinking only about my name; for  without having penetrated into any perfectly savage country, I had been  about the world a great deal for a young man, visiting the Colonies,  India, Yokohama, and other distant places, and I had never yet been told  that the name of Smith was an unfamiliar one.    \"I hardly know what to say,\" I returned, for he was evidently waiting  for me to add something more to what I had stated. \"It rather staggers  me to hear that my name-well, you have not heard of _me_, of  course, but there have been a great many distinguished men of the same  name: Sydney Smith, for instance, and--and several others.\" It mortified  me just then to find that I had forgotten all the other distinguished  Smiths.    He shook his head, and continued watching my face.    \"Not heard of them!\" I exclaimed. \"Well, I suppose you have heard of  some of my great countrymen: Beaconsfield, Gladstone, Darwin,  Burne-Jones, Ruskin, Queen Victoria, Tennyson, George Eliot, Herbert  Spencer, General Gordon, Lord Randolph Churchill--\"    As he continued to shake his head after each name I at length paused.    \"Who are all these people you have named?\" he asked.    \"They are all great and illustrious men and women who have a world-wide  reputation,\" I answered.    \"And are there no more of them--have you told me the names of _all_  the great people you have ever known or heard of?\" he said, with a  curious smile.    \"No, indeed,\" I answered, nettled at his words and manner. \"It would  take me until to-morrow to name _all_ the great men I have ever  heard of. I suppose you have heard the names of Napoleon, Wellington,  Nelson, Dante, Luther, Calvin, Bismarck, Voltaire?\"    He still shook his head.    \"Well, then,\" I continued, \"Homer, Socrates, Alexander the Great,  Confucius, Zoroaster, Plato, Shakespeare.\" Then, growing thoroughly  desperate, I added in a burst: \"Noah, Moses, Columbus, Hannibal, Adam  and Eve!\"    \"I am quite sure that I have never heard of any of these names,\" he  answered, still with that curious smile. \"Nevertheless I can understand  your surprise. It sometimes happens that the mind, owing an an imperfect  adjustment of its faculties, resembles the uneducated vision in its  method of judgment, regarding the things which are near as great and  important, and those further away as less important, according to their  distance. In such a case the individuals one hears about or associates  with, come to be looked upon as the great and illustrious beings of the  world, and all men in all places are expected to be familiar with their  names. But come, my children, our sorrowful task is over, let us now  return to the house. Come with us, Smith, and you shall have the  refreshment you require.\"    I was, of course, pleased with the invitation, but did not relish being  addressed as \"Smith,\" like some mere laborer or other common person  tramping about the country.    The long disconcerting scrutiny I had been subjected to had naturally  made me very uncomfortable, and caused me to drop a little behind the  others as we walked towards the house. The old man, however, still kept  at my side; but whether from motives of courtesy, or because he wished  to badger me a little more about my uncouth appearance and defective  intellect, I was not sure. I was not anxious to continue the  conversation, which had not proved very satisfactory; moreover, the  beautiful girl I have already mentioned so frequently, was now walking  just before me, hand in hand with the young man who had raised her from  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7413"],[0,"Egyptian Tales, Translated from the Papyri: Second series, XVIIIth to XIXth (#3)"],[1,"he drank, and was drunk, and lay upside down. Then  his wife made it to perish with the blows of her dagger. And they woke  her husband, who was astonished; and she said unto him, \"Behold thy God  has given one of thy dooms into thy hand; He will also give thee the  others.\" And he sacrificed to God, adoring Him, and praising His spirits  from day to day.    And when the days were passed after these things, the youth went to walk  in the fields of his domain. He went not alone, behold his dog was  following him. And his dog ran aside after the wild game, and he  followed the dog. He came to the river, and entered the river behind  his dog. Then came out the crocodile, and took him to the place where  the mighty man was. And the crocodile said to the youth, \"I am thy doom,  following after thee. ...\"    [Here the papyrus breaks off.]            REMARKS      This tale is preserved in one of the Harris papyri (No. 500) in the  British Museum. It has been translated by Goodwin, Chabas, Maspero, and  Ebers. The present version is adapted from that of Maspero, with  frequent reference by Mr. Griffith to the original.    The marvellous parentage of a fated or gifted hero is familiar in  Eastern tales, and he is often described as a divine reward to a  long-childless king. This element of fate or destiny is, however, not  seen before this age in Egyptian ideas; nor, indeed, would it seem at  all in place with the simple, easygoing, joyous life of the early days.  It belongs to an age when ideals possess the mind, when man struggles  against his circumstances, when he wills to be different from what he  is. Dedi or the shipwrecked sailor think nothing about fate, but live  day by day as life comes to them. There is here, then, a new element,  that of striving and of unrest, quite foreign to the old Egyptian mind.  The age of this tale is shown plainly in the incidents.  The prince goes  to the chief of Naharaina, a land probably unknown to the Egyptians  until the Asiatic conquests of the XVIIIth Dynasty had led them to the  upper waters of the Euphrates. In earlier days Sanehat fled to the  frontier at the Wady Tumilat, and was quite lost to Egypt when he  settled in the south of Palestine. But when the Doomed Prince goes out  of Egypt he goes to the chief of Naharaina, as the frontier State. This  stamps the tale as subsequent to the wars of the Tahutimes family, and  reflects rather the peaceful intercourse of the great monarch Amenhotep  the Third. If it belonged to the Ramessides we should not hear of  Naharaina, which was quite lost to them, but rather of Dapur (Tabor) and  Kadesh, and of the Hittites as the familiar frontier power.    The Hathors here appear as the Fates, instead of the goddesses Isis,  Nebhat, Mes-khent, and Hakt, of the old tale in the IVth Dynasty (see  first series, p. 33); and we find in the next tale of Anpu and Bata, in  the XIXth Dynasty, that the seven Hathors decree the fate of the wife of  Bata. That Hathor should be a name given to seven deities is not strange  when we see that Hathor was a generic name for a goddess. There was the  Hathor of foreign lands, such as Punt or Sinai; there was the Hathor of  home towns, as Dendera or Atfih; and Hathor was as widely known, and yet  as local, as the Madonna. In short, to one of the races which composed  the Egyptian people Hathor was the term for any goddess, or for a  universal goddess to whom all others were assimilated. Why and how this  title \"house of Horus\" should be so general is not obvious.    The variety of fate here predicted is like the vagueness of the fate of  Bata's wife, by \"a sharp death.\" It points to the Hathors predicting as  seers, rather than to their having the control of the future. It bears  the stamp of the oracle of Delphi, rather than that of a divine decree.  In this these goddesses differ greatly from the Parcae, whose ordinances  not even Zeus could withstand, as Lucian lets us know in one of the most  audacious and philosophical of the dialogues. The Hathors seem rather to  deal with what we should call luck than with fate: they see the nature  of the close of life from its beginning, without either knowing or  controlling its details.    In this tale we meet for the first time the idea of inaccessible and  mysterious buildings; and from the resort to this element or curiosity  in describing both the prince and the princess, it appears as if it were  then a new motive in story-telling, and had not lost its power. To  modern ears it is, of course, done to death since the \"Castle of  Otranto\"; though as a minor element it can still be gently used by the  poet and novelist in a moated grange, a house in a marsh or a maze.  Another point of wonder, so well known in later times, is the large and  mystic number of windows, like the 365 windows attributed to great  buildings of the present age.  It would not be difficult from these  papyrus tales to start an historical dictionary of the elements of  fiction: a kind of analysis that should be the death of much of the  venerable stock-in-trade.    We see coming in here, more strongly than before, the use of emotions  and the force of character. The generous friendship of the sons of the  Syrian chiefs; then the burst of passionate love from the chiefs  daughter, which saves the prince's life twice over from her father, and  guards him afterwards from his fates; again, the devotion of the prince  to his favourite dog, in spite of all warnings--these show a reliance on  personal emotion and feeling in creating the interest of the tale, quite  different from the mere interest of incident which was employed earlier.  The reason which the prince alleges for his leaving Egypt is also a  touch of nature, the wish of a mother to oust her stepson in order to  make way for her own children, one of the deepest and most elemental  feelings of feminine nature.    The mighty man and the crocodile are difficult to understand, the more  so as the tale breaks off in the midst of that part. It appears also as  if there had been some inversion of the paragraphs; for, first, we read  that the wife would not let the prince go alone, and one goes with him  toward Egypt, and the crocodile of the Nile (apparently) is mentioned;  then he is said to be sitting in his house with his wife; then he goes  in the fields of his domain and meets the crocodile. It may be that a  passage has dropped out, describing his wife's accompanying him to  settle in Egypt. But the mighty man--that is another puzzle. He binds a  crocodile, and goes out while he is bound, but by night. The point of  this is not clear. It may have been, however, that the mighty man went  back to the house when the sun was high, that he might not lose his  shadow. In Arabia there was a belief that a hyena could deprive a man  of speech and motion by stepping on his shadow--analogous to the belief  in many other lands of the importance of preserving the shadow, and  avoiding the shadowless hour of high noon (Frazer, \"Golden Bough,\" p.  143). Hence the strength of the mighty man, and his magic power over the  crocodile, would perhaps depend on his not allowing his shadow to  disappear. And though Egypt is not quite tropical, yet shadows do  practically vanish in the summer, the shadow of the thin branches of a  tall palm appearing to radiate round its root without the stem casting  any shade.    The use of milk to entice serpents is still well known in Egypt; and  when a serpent appeared in some of my excavations in a pit, the men  proposed to me to let down a saucer of milk to entice it out, that they  might kill it.    The close of the tale would have explained much that is now lost to us.  The crocodile boasts of being the fate of the prince; but his dog is  with him, and one can hardly doubt that the dog attacks the crocodile.  There is also the mighty man to come in and manage the crocodile. Then  the dog is left to bring about the catastrophe. Or does the faithful  wife rescue him from all the fates? Hardly so, as the prediction of the  Hathors comes strictly to pass in the tale of Anpu and Bata. Let us hope  that another copy may be found to give us the clue to the working of the  Egyptian mind in this situation.          XIXTH DYNASTY    ANPU AND BATA.      Once there were two brethren, of one mother and one father; Anpu was the  name of the elder, and Bata was the name of the younger. Now, as for  Anpu he had a house, and he had a wife. But his little brother was to  him as it were a son; he it was who made for him his clothes; he it was  who followed behind his oxen to the fields; he it was who did the  ploughing; he it was who harvested the corn; he it was who did for him  all the matters that were in the field. Behold, his younger brother grew  to be an excellent worker, there was not his equal in the whole land;  behold, the spirit of a god was in him.    Now after this the younger brother followed his oxen in his daily  manner; and every evening he turned again to the house, laden with all  the herbs of the field, with milk and with wood, and with all things of  the field. And he put them down before his elder brother, who was  sitting with his wife; and he drank and ate, and he lay down in his  stable with the cattle. And at the dawn of day he took bread which he  had baked, and laid it before his elder brother; and he took with him  his bread to the field, and he drave his cattle to pasture in the  fields. And as he walked behind his cattle, they said to him, \"Good is  the herbage which is in that place;\" and he listened to all that they  said, and he took them to the good place which they desired. And the  cattle which were before him became exceeding excellent, and they  multiplied greatly.    Now at the time of ploughing his elder brother said unto him, \"Let us  make ready for ourselves a goodly yoke of oxen for ploughing, for the  land has come out from the water, it is fit for ploughing. Moreover, do  thou"]]]
