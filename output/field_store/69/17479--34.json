[69] Certain of these animals, milk-white, and untouched by earthly  labor, are pastured at the public expense in the sacred woods and  groves. These, yoked to a consecrated chariot, are accompanied by the  priest, and king, or chief person of the community, who attentively  observe their manner of neighing and snorting; and no kind of augury  is more credited, not only among the populace, but among the nobles  and priests. For the latter consider themselves as the ministers of  the gods, and the horses, as privy to the divine will. Another kind of  divination, by which they explore the event of momentous wars, is to  oblige a prisoner, taken by any means whatsoever from the nation with  whom they are at variance, to fight with a picked man of their own, each  with his own country's arms; and, according as the victory falls, they  presage success to the one or to the other party. [70]    11. On affairs of smaller moment, the chiefs consult; on those of  greater importance, the whole community; yet with this circumstance,  that what is referred to the decision of the people, is first maturely  discussed by the chiefs. [71] They assemble, unless upon some sudden  emergency, on stated days, either at the new or full moon, which they  account the most auspicious season for beginning any enterprise. Nor do  they, in their computation of time, reckon, like us, by the number of  days, but of nights. In this way they arrange their business; in this  way they fix their appointments; so that, with them, the night seems to  lead the day. [72] An inconvenience produced by their liberty is, that  they do not all assemble at a stated time, as if it were in obedience  to a command; but two or three days are lost in the delays of convening.  When they all think fit, [73] they sit down armed. [74] Silence is  proclaimed by the priests, who have on this occasion a coercive power.  Then the king, or chief, and such others as are conspicuous for age,  birth, military renown, or eloquence, are heard; and gain attention  rather from their ability to persuade, than their authority to command.  If a proposal displease, the assembly reject it by an inarticulate  murmur; if it prove agreeable, they clash their javelins; [75] for the  most honorable expression of assent among them is the sound of arms.    12. Before this council, it is likewise allowed to exhibit accusations,  and to prosecute capital offences. Punishments are varied according to  the nature of the crime. Traitors and deserters are hung upon trees:  [76] cowards, dastards, [77] and those guilty of unnatural practices,  [78] are suffocated in mud under a hurdle. [79] This difference of  punishment has in view the principle, that villainy should be exposed  while it is punished, but turpitude concealed. The penalties annexed  to slighter offences [80] are also proportioned to the delinquency. The  convicts are fined in horses and cattle: [81] part of the mulct [82]  goes to the king or state; part to the injured person, or his relations.  In the same assemblies chiefs [83] are also elected, to administer  justice through the cantons and districts. A hundred companions, chosen  from the people, attended upon each of them, to assist them as well with  their advice as their authority.    13. The Germans transact no business, public or private, without being  armed: [84] but it is not customary for any person to assume arms till  the state has approved his ability to use them. Then, in the midst of  the assembly, either one of the chiefs, or the father, or a relation,  equips the youth with a shield and javelin. [85] These are to them the  manly gown; [86] this is the first honor conferred on youth: before this  they are considered as part of a household; afterwards, of the state.  The dignity of chieftain is bestowed even on mere lads, whose descent is  eminently illustrious, or whose fathers have performed signal services  to the public; they are associated, however, with those of mature  strength, who have already been declared capable of service; nor do  they blush to be seen in the rank of companions. [87] For the state of  companionship itself has its several degrees, determined by the judgment  of him whom they follow; and there is a great emulation among the  companions, which shall possess the highest place in the favor of their  chief; and among the chiefs, which shall excel in the number and valor  of his companions. It is their dignity, their strength, to be always  surrounded with a large body of select youth, an ornament in peace,  a bulwark in war. And not in his own country alone, but among the  neighboring states, the fame and glory of each chief consists in being  distinguished for the number and bravery of his companions. Such chiefs  are courted by embassies; distinguished by presents; and often by their  reputation alone decide a war.    14. In the field of battle, it is disgraceful for the chief to be  surpassed in valor; it is disgraceful for the companions not to equal  their chief; but it is reproach and infamy during a whole succeeding  life to retreat from the field surviving him. [88] To aid, to protect  him; to place their own gallant actions to the account of his glory, is  their first and most sacred engagement. The chiefs fight for victory;  the companions for their chief. If their native country be long sunk in  peace and inaction, many of the young nobles repair to some other state  then engaged in war. For, besides that repose is unwelcome to their  race, and toils and perils afford them a better opportunity of  distinguishing themselves; they are unable, without war and violence,  to maintain a large train of followers. The companion requires from the  liberality of his chief, the warlike steed, the bloody and conquering  spear: and in place of pay, he expects to be supplied with a table,  homely indeed, but plentiful. [89] The funds for this munificence  must be found in war and rapine; nor are they so easily persuaded  to cultivate the earth, and await the produce of the seasons, as to  challenge the foe, and expose themselves to wounds; nay, they even think  it base and spiritless to earn by sweat what they might purchase with  blood.    15. During the intervals of war, they pass their time less in hunting  than in a sluggish repose, [90] divided between sleep and the table.  All the bravest of the warriors, committing the care of the house, the  family affairs, and the lands, to the women, old men, and weaker part  of the domestics, stupefy themselves in inaction: so wonderful is the  contrast presented by nature, that the same persons love indolence,  and hate tranquillity! [91] It is customary for the several states to  present, by voluntary and individual contributions, [92] cattle or grain  [93] to their chiefs; which are accepted as honorary gifts, while they  serve as necessary supplies. [94] They are peculiarly pleased with  presents from neighboring nations, offered not only by individuals,  but by the community at large; such as fine horses, heavy armor, rich  housings, and gold chains. We have now taught them also to accept of  money. [95]    16. It is well known that none of the German nations inhabit cities;  [96] or even admit of contiguous settlements. They dwell scattered and  separate, as a spring, a meadow, or a grove may chance to invite  them. Their villages are laid out, not like ours in rows of adjoining  buildings; but every one surrounds his house with a vacant space, [97]  either by way of security against fire, [97] or through ignorance of  the art of building. For, indeed, they are unacquainted with the use  of mortar and tiles; and for every purpose employ rude unshapen timber,  fashioned with no regard to pleasing the eye. They bestow more than  ordinary pains in coating certain parts of their buildings with a kind  of earth, so pure and shining that it gives the appearance of painting.  They also dig subterraneous caves, [99] and cover them over with a great  quantity of dung. These they use as winter-retreats, and granaries; for  they preserve a moderate temperature; and upon an invasion, when the  open country is plundered, these recesses remain unviolated, either  because the enemy is ignorant of them, or because he will not trouble  himself with the search. [100]    17. The clothing common to all is a sagum [101] fastened by a clasp, or,  in want of that, a thorn. With no other covering, they pass whole days  on the hearth, before the fire. The more wealthy are distinguished by a  vest, not flowing loose, like those of the Sarmatians and Parthians, but  girt close, and exhibiting the shape of every limb. They also wear the  skins of beasts, which the people near the borders are less curious in  selecting or preparing than the more remote inhabitants, who cannot by  commerce procure other clothing. These make choice of particular skins,  which they variegate with spots, and strips of the furs of marine  animals, [102] the produce of the exterior ocean, and seas to us  unknown. [103] The dress of the women does not differ from that of the  men; except that they more frequently wear linen, [104] which they stain  with purple; [105] and do not lengthen their upper garment into sleeves,  but leave exposed the whole arm, and part of the breast.    18. The matrimonial bond is, nevertheless, strict and severe among them;  nor is there anything in their manners more commendable than this. [106]  Almost singly among the barbarians, they content themselves with one  wife; a very few of them excepted, who, not through incontinence, but  because their alliance is solicited on account of their rank, [107]  practise polygamy. The wife does not bring a dowry to her husband, but  receives one from him. [108] The parents and relations assemble, and  pass their approbation on the presents--presents not adapted to please  a female taste, or decorate "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/754"],[0,"The Story of Mankind (#3)"],[1,"and on the mud-banks that lay at the foot of the mountains.  Twice a day the tides of the ocean covered them with their brine. For  the rest of the time, the plants made the best of their uncomfortable  situation and tried to survive in the thin air which surrounded the  surface of the planet. After centuries of training, they learned how  to live as comfortably in the air as they had done in the water. They  increased in size and became shrubs and trees and at last they learned  how to grow lovely flowers which attracted the attention of the busy big  bumble-bees and the birds who carried the seeds far and wide until the  whole earth had become covered with green pastures, or lay dark under  the shadow of the big trees. But some of the fishes too had begun to  leave the sea, and they had learned how to breathe with lungs as well as  with gills. We call such creatures amphibious, which means that they  are able to live with equal ease on the land and in the water. The first  frog who crosses your path can tell you all about the pleasures of the  double existence of the amphibian.    Once outside of the water, these animals gradually adapted themselves  more and more to life on land. Some became reptiles (creatures who  crawl like lizards) and they shared the silence of the forests with  the insects. That they might move faster through the soft soil, they  improved upon their legs and their size increased until the world was  populated with gigantic forms (which the hand-books of biology list  under the names of Ichthyosaurus and Megalosaurus and Brontosaurus)  who grew to be thirty to forty feet long and who could have played with  elephants as a full grown cat plays with her kittens.    Some of the members of this reptilian family began to live in the tops  of the trees, which were then often more than a hundred feet high.  They no longer needed their legs for the purpose of walking, but it was  necessary for them to move quickly from branch to branch. And so they  changed a part of their skin into a sort of parachute, which stretched  between the sides of their bodies and the small toes of their fore-feet,  and gradually they covered this skinny parachute with feathers and  made their tails into a steering gear and flew from tree to tree and  developed into true birds.    Then a strange thing happened. All the gigantic reptiles died within a  short time. We do not know the reason. Perhaps it was due to a sudden  change in climate. Perhaps they had grown so large that they could  neither swim nor walk nor crawl, and they starved to death within sight  but not within reach of the big ferns and trees. Whatever the cause, the  million year old world-empire of the big reptiles was over.    The world now began to be occupied by very different creatures. They  were the descendants of the reptiles but they were quite unlike these  because they fed their young from the \"mammae\" or the breasts of the  mother. Wherefore modern science calls these animals \"mammals.\" They  had shed the scales of the fish. They did not adopt the feathers of  the bird, but they covered their bodies with hair. The mammals however  developed other habits which gave their race a great advantage over the  other animals. The female of the species carried the eggs of the young  inside her body until they were hatched and while all other living  beings, up to that time, had left their children exposed to the dangers  of cold and heat, and the attacks of wild beasts, the mammals kept their  young with them for a long time and sheltered them while they were still  too weak to fight their enemies. In this way the young mammals were  given a much better chance to survive, because they learned many things  from their mothers, as you will know if you have ever watched a cat  teaching her kittens to take care of themselves and how to wash their  faces and how to catch mice.    But of these mammals I need not tell you much for you know them well.  They surround you on all sides. They are your daily companions in the  streets and in your home, and you can see your less familiar cousins  behind the bars of the zoological garden.    And now we come to the parting of the ways when man suddenly leaves the  endless procession of dumbly living and dying creatures and begins to  use his reason to shape the destiny of his race.    One mammal in particular seemed to surpass all others in its ability  to find food and shelter. It had learned to use its fore-feet for the  purpose of holding its prey, and by dint of practice it had developed a  hand-like claw. After innumerable attempts it had learned how to balance  the whole of the body upon the hind legs. (This is a difficult act,  which every child has to learn anew although the human race has been  doing it for over a million years.)    This creature, half ape and half monkey but superior to both, became  the most successful hunter and could make a living in every clime. For  greater safety, it usually moved about in groups. It learned how to make  strange grunts to warn its young of approaching danger and after many  hundreds of thousands of years it began to use these throaty noises for  the purpose of talking.    This creature, though you may hardly believe it, was your first  \"man-like\" ancestor.          OUR EARLIEST ANCESTORS      WE know very little about the first \"true\" men. We have never seen  their pictures. In the deepest layer of clay of an ancient soil we  have sometimes found pieces of their bones. These lay buried amidst the  broken skeletons of other animals that have long since disappeared from  the face of the earth. Anthropologists (learned scientists who devote  their lives to the study of man as a member of the animal kingdom) have  taken these bones and they have been able to reconstruct our earliest  ancestors with a fair degree of accuracy.    The great-great-grandfather of the human race was a very ugly and  unattractive mammal. He was quite small, much smaller than the people  of today. The heat of the sun and the biting wind of the cold winter had  coloured his skin a dark brown. His head and most of his body, his arms  and legs too, were covered with long, coarse hair. He had very thin but  strong fingers which made his hands look like those of a monkey. His  forehead was low and his jaw was like the jaw of a wild animal which  uses its teeth both as fork and knife. He wore no clothes. He had seen  no fire except the flames of the rumbling volcanoes which filled the  earth with their smoke and their lava.    He lived in the damp blackness of vast forests, as the pygmies of Africa  do to this very day. When he felt the pangs of hunger he ate raw leaves  and the roots of plants or he took the eggs away from an angry bird and  fed them to his own young. Once in a while, after a long and patient  chase, he would catch a sparrow or a small wild dog or perhaps a rabbit.  These he would eat raw for he had never discovered that food tasted  better when it was cooked.    During the hours of day, this primitive human being prowled about  looking for things to eat.    When night descended upon the earth, he hid his wife and his children  in a hollow tree or behind some heavy boulders, for he was surrounded on  all sides by ferocious animals and when it was dark these animals began  to prowl about, looking for something to eat for their mates and their  own young, and they liked the taste of human beings. It was a world  where you must either eat or be eaten, and life was very unhappy because  it was full of fear and misery.    In summer, man was exposed to the scorching rays of the sun, and during  the winter his children would freeze to death in his arms. When such a  creature hurt itself, (and hunting animals are forever breaking their  bones or spraining their ankles) he had no one to take care of him and  he must die a horrible death.    Like many of the animals who fill the Zoo with their strange noises,  early man liked to jabber. That is to say, he endlessly repeated the  same unintelligible gibberish because it pleased him to hear the sound  of his voice. In due time he learned that he could use this guttural  noise to warn his fellow beings whenever danger threatened and he gave  certain little shrieks which came to mean \"there is a tiger!\" or \"here  come five elephants.\" Then the others grunted something back at him and  their growl meant, \"I see them,\" or \"let us run away and hide.\" And this  was probably the origin of all language.    But, as I have said before, of these beginnings we know so very little.  Early man had no tools and he built himself no houses. He lived and died  and left no trace of his existence except a few collar-bones and a few  pieces of his skull. These tell us that many thousands of years ago the  world was inhabited by certain mammals who were quite different from  all the other animals--who had probably developed from another unknown  ape-like animal which had learned to walk on its hind-legs and use  its fore-paws as hands--and who were most probably connected with the  creatures who happen to be our own immediate ancestors.    It is little enough we know and the rest is darkness.          PREHISTORIC MAN    PREHISTORIC MAN BEGINS TO MAKE THINGS FOR HIMSELF.      EARLY man did not know what time meant. He kept no records of birthdays  or wedding anniversaries or the hour of death. He had no idea of days or  weeks or even years. But in a general way he kept track of the seasons  for he had noticed that the cold winter was invariably followed by the  mild spring--that spring grew into the hot summer when fruits ripened  and the wild ears of corn were ready to be eaten and that summer ended  when sudden gusts of wind swept the leaves from the trees and a number  of animals were getting ready for the long hibernal sleep.    But now, something unusual and rather frightening had happened.  Something was the matter with the weather. The warm days of"]]]
