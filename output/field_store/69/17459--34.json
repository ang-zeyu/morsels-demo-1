Then Tom rented an orchard up the creek, and a hailstorm  destroyed all the fruit. Germany happened to be represented at the time,  Jacob having sought shelter at Tom's but on his way home from town. Tom  stood leaning against the door post with the hail beating on him through  it all. His eyes were very bright and very dry, and every breath was  a choking sob. Jacob let him stand there, and sat inside with a dreamy  expression on his hard face, thinking of childhood and fatherland,  perhaps. When it was over he led Tom to a stool and said, \"You waits  there, Tom. I must go home for somedings. You sits there still and waits  twenty minutes;\" then he got on his horse and rode off muttering to  himself; \"Dot man moost gry, dot man moost gry.\" He was back inside of  twenty minutes with a bottle of wine and a cornet under his overcoat. He  poured the wine into two pint-pots, made Tom drink, drank himself, and  then took his cornet, stood up at the door, and played a German march  into the rain after the retreating storm. The hail had passed over his  vineyard and he was a ruined man too. Tom did \"gry\" and was all right.  He was a bit disheartened, but he did another job of fencing, and was  just beginning to think about \"puttin' in a few vines an' fruit-trees\"  when the government surveyors--whom he'd forgotten all about--had a  resurrection and came and surveyed, and found that the real selection  was located amongst some barren ridges across the creek. Tom reckoned  it was lucky he didn't plant the orchard, and he set about shifting his  home and fences to the new site. But the squatter interfered at this  point, entered into possession of the farm and all on it, and took  action against the selector for trespass--laying the damages at L2500.    Tom was admitted to the lunatic asylum at Parramatta next year, and the  squatter was sent there the following summer, having been ruined by the  drought, the rabbits, the banks, and a wool-ring. The two became very  friendly, and had many a sociable argument about the feasibility--or  otherwise--of blowing open the flood-gates of Heaven in a dry season  with dynamite.    Tom was discharged a few years since. He knocks about certain suburbs  a good deal. He is seen in daylight seldom, and at night mostly in  connection with a dray and a lantern. He says his one great regret is  that he wasn't found to be of unsound mind before he went up-country.        ENTER MITCHELL      The Western train had just arrived at Redfern railway station with a lot  of ordinary passengers and one swagman.    He was short, and stout, and bow-legged, and freckled, and sandy. He had  red hair and small, twinkling, grey eyes, and--what often goes with such  things--the expression of a born comedian. He was dressed in a ragged,  well-washed print shirt, an old black waistcoat with a calico back, a  pair of cloudy moleskins patched at the knees and held up by a plaited  greenhide belt buckled loosely round his hips, a pair of well-worn,  fuzzy blucher boots, and a soft felt hat, green with age, and with no  brim worth mentioning, and no crown to speak of. He swung a swag on to  the platform, shouldered it, pulled out a billy and water-bag, and then  went to a dog-box in the brake van.    Five minutes later he appeared on the edge of the cab platform, with an  anxious-looking cattle-dog crouching against his legs, and one end of  the chain in his hand. He eased down the swag against a post, turned  his face to the city, tilted his hat forward, and scratched the  well-developed back of his head with a little finger. He seemed  undecided what track to take.    \"Cab, Sir!\"    The swagman turned slowly and regarded cabby with a quiet grin.    \"Now, do I look as if I want a cab?\"    \"Well, why not? No harm, anyway--I thought you might want a cab.\"    Swaggy scratched his head, reflectively.    \"Well,\" he said, \"you're the first man that has thought so these ten  years. What do I want with a cab?\"    \"To go where you're going, of course.\"    \"Do I look knocked up?\"    \"I didn't say you did.\"    \"And I didn't say you said I did.... Now, I've been on the track this  five years. I've tramped two thousan' miles since last Chris'mas, and I  don't see why I can't tramp the last mile. Do you think my old dog wants  a cab?\"    The dog shivered and whimpered; he seemed to want to get away from the  crowd.    \"But then, you see, you ain't going to carry that swag through the  streets, are you?\" asked the cabman.    \"Why not? Who'll stop me! There ain't no law agin it, I b'lieve?\"    \"But then, you see, it don't look well, you know.\"    \"Ah! I thought we'd get to it at last.\"    The traveller up-ended his bluey against his knee, gave it an  affectionate pat, and then straightened himself up and looked fixedly at  the cabman.    \"Now, look here!\" he said, sternly and impressively, \"can you see  anything wrong with that old swag o' mine?\"    It was a stout, dumpy swag, with a red blanket outside, patched with  blue, and the edge of a blue blanket showing in the inner rings at the  end. The swag might have been newer; it might have been cleaner;  it might have been hooped with decent straps, instead of bits of  clothes-line and greenhide--but otherwise there was nothing the matter  with it, as swags go.    \"I've humped that old swag for years,\" continued the bushman; \"I've  carried that old swag thousands of miles--as that old dog knows--an'  no one ever bothered about the look of it, or of me, or of my old dog,  neither; and do you think I'm going to be ashamed of that old swag,  for a cabby or anyone else? Do you think I'm going to study anybody's  feelings? No one ever studied mine! I'm in two minds to summon you for  using insulting language towards me!\"    He lifted the swag by the twisted towel which served for a  shoulder-strap, swung it into the cab, got in himself and hauled the dog  after him.    \"You can drive me somewhere where I can leave my swag and dog while I  get some decent clothes to see a tailor in,\" he said to the cabman. \"My  old dog ain't used to cabs, you see.\"    Then he added, reflectively: \"I drove a cab myself, once, for five years  in Sydney.\"        Stiffner and Jim    (Thirdly, Bill)      We were tramping down in Canterbury, Maoriland, at the time, swagging  it--me and Bill--looking for work on the new railway line. Well,  one afternoon, after a long, hot tramp, we comes to Stiffner's  Hotel--between Christchurch and that other place--I forget the name  of it--with throats on us like sunstruck bones, and not the price of a  stick of tobacco.    We had to have a drink, anyway, so we chanced it. We walked right into  the bar, handed over our swags, put up four drinks, and tried to look as  if we'd just drawn our cheques and didn't care a curse for any man. We  looked solvent enough, as far as swagmen go. We were dirty and haggard  and ragged and tired-looking, and that was all the more reason why we  might have our cheques all right.    This Stiffner was a hard customer. He'd been a spieler, fighting man,  bush parson, temperance preacher, and a policeman, and a commercial  traveller, and everything else that was damnable; he'd been a  journalist, and an editor; he'd been a lawyer, too. He was an ugly brute  to look at, and uglier to have a row with--about six-foot-six, wide in  proportion, and stronger than Donald Dinnie.    He was meaner than a gold-field Chinaman, and sharper than a sewer rat:  he wouldn't give his own father a feed, nor lend him a sprat--unless  some safe person backed the old man's I.O.U.    We knew that we needn't expect any mercy from Stiffner; but something  had to be done, so I said to Bill:    \"Something's got to be done, Bill! What do you think of it?\"    Bill was mostly a quiet young chap, from Sydney, except when he got  drunk--which was seldom--and then he was a customer, from all round. He  was cracked on the subject of spielers. He held that the population of  the world was divided into two classes--one was spielers and the other  was the mugs. He reckoned that he wasn't a mug. At first I thought he  was a spieler, and afterwards I thought that he was a mug. He used to  say that a man had to do it these times; that he was honest once and  a fool, and was robbed and starved in consequences by his friends and  relations; but now he intended to take all that he could get. He said  that you either had to have or be had; that men were driven to be  sharps, and there was no help for it.    Bill said:    \"We'll have to sharpen our teeth, that's all, and chew somebody's lug.\"    \"How?\" I asked.    There was a lot of navvies at the pub, and I knew one or two by sight,  so Bill says:    \"You know one or two of these mugs. Bite one of their ears.    \"So I took aside a chap that I knowed and bit his ear for ten bob, and  gave it to Bill to mind, for I thought it would be safer with him than  with me.    \"Hang on to that,\" I says, \"and don't lose it for your natural life's  sake, or Stiffner'll stiffen us.\"    We put up about nine bob's worth of drinks that night--me and Bill--and  Stiffner didn't squeal: he was too sharp. He shouted once or twice.    By-and-by I left Bill and turned in, and in the morning when I woke up  there was Bill sitting alongside of me, and looking about as lively  as the fighting kangaroo in London in fog time. He had a black eye and  eighteen pence. He'd been taking down some of the mugs.    \"Well, what's to be done now?\" I asked. \"Stiffner can smash us both with  one hand, and if we don't pay up he'll pound our swags and cripple us.  He's just the man to do it. He loves a fight even more than he hates  being had.\"    \"There's only one thing to be done, Jim,\" says Bill, in a tired,  disinterested tone that made me mad.    \"Well, what's than\" I said.    \"Smoke!\"    \"Smoke be damned,\" I snarled, losing my temper.    \"You know dashed well that our swags are in the bar, and we can't smoke  without "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7188"],[0,"Higher Lessons in English: A work on English grammar and composition (#3)"],[1,"for similar  reasons. _Feathers are soft_, _The sun shines_ are sentences. Here the  asserting word is supplied, and something is said of something else.    _The shines sun_ is not a sentence; for, though it contains the asserting  word _shines_, the arrangement is such that no assertion is made, and no  thought is expressed.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 3.    A TALK ON SOUNDS AND LETTERS.    We have already told you that in expressing our ideas and thoughts we use  two kinds of words, spoken words and written words.    We learned the spoken words first. Mankind spoke long before they wrote.  Not until people wished to communicate with those at a distance, or had  thought out something worth handing down to aftertimes, did they need to  write.    But speaking was easy. The air, the lungs, and the organs of the throat and  mouth were at hand. The first cry was a suggestion. Sounds and noises were  heard on every side, provoking imitation, and the need of speech for the  purposes of communication was imperative.    Spoken words are made up of sounds. There are over forty sounds in the  English language. The different combinations of these give us all the words  of our spoken tongue. That you may clearly understand these sounds, we will  tell you something about the human voice.    In talking, the air driven out from your lungs beats against two flat  muscles, stretched, like bands, across the top of the windpipe, and causes  them to vibrate up and down. This vibration makes sound. Take a thread, put  one end between your teeth, hold the other with thumb and finger, draw it  tight and strike it, and you will understand how voice is made. The shorter  the string, or the tighter it is drawn, the faster will it vibrate, and the  higher will be the pitch of the sound. The more violent the blow, the  farther will the string vibrate, and the louder will be the sound. Just so  with these vocal bands or cords. The varying force with which the breath  strikes them and their different tensions and lengths at different times,  explain the different degrees of loudness and the varying pitch of the  voice.    If the voice thus produced comes out through the mouth held well open, a  class of sounds is formed which we call vowel sounds.    But if the voice is held back or obstructed by the palate, tongue, teeth,  or lips, one kind of the sounds called consonant sounds is made. If the  breath is driven out without voice, and is held back by these same parts of  the mouth, the other kind of consonant sounds is formed.    The written word is made up of characters, or letters, which represent to  the eye these sounds that address the ear.    You are now prepared to understand us when we say that +vowels+ are the  +letters+ that stand for the +open sounds+ of the +voice+, and that  +consonants+ are the +letters+ that stand for the sounds made by the  +obstructed voice+ and the +obstructed breath+.    The alphabet of a language is a complete list of its letters. A perfect  alphabet would have one letter for each sound, and only one.    Our alphabet is imperfect in at least these three ways:--    1. Some of the letters are superfluous; _c_ stands for the sound of _s_ or  of _k_, as in _city_ and _can_; _q_ has the sound of _k_, as in _quit_; and  _x_ that of _ks_, _gz_, or _z_, as in _expel_, _exist_, and _Xenophon_.    2. Combinations of letters sometimes represent single sounds; as, _th_ in  thine, _th_ in _thin_, _ng_ in _sing_, and _sh_ in _shut_.    3. Some letters stand each for many sounds. Twenty-three letters represent  over forty sounds. Every vowel does more than single duty; _e_ stands for  two sounds, as in _mete_ and _met_; _i_ for two, as in _pine_ and _pin_;  _o_ for three, as in _note, not_, and _move_; _u_ for four, as in _tube,  tub, full_, and _fur_; _a_ for six, as in _fate, fat, far, fall, fast_, and  _fare_.    _W_ is a vowel when it unites with a preceding vowel to represent a vowel  sound, and _y_ is a vowel when it has the sound of _i_, as in _now, by,  boy, newly_. _W_ and _y_ are consonants at the beginning of a word or  syllable.    The various sounds of the several vowels and even of the same vowel are  caused by the different shapes which the mouth assumes. These changes in  its cavity produce, also, the two sounds that unite in each of the  compounds, _ou_, _oi_, _ew_, and in the alphabetic _i_ and _o_.           1.                 2.  _Vocal Consonants_.  _Aspirates_.         b..................p         d..................t         g..................k         -------------------h         j..................ch         l------------------         m------------------         n------------------         r------------------         th.................th    (in _thine_)       (in _thin_)         v..................f         w------------------         y------------------         z (in _zone_)......s         z (in _azure_).....sh    The consonants in column 1 represent the sounds made by the obstructed  voice; those in column 2, except _h_ (which represents a mere forcible  breathing), represent those made by the obstructed breath.    The letters are mostly in pairs. Now note that the tongue, teeth, lips, and  palate are placed in the same relative position to make the sounds of both  letters in any pair. The difference in the sounds of the letters of any  pair is simply this: there is voice in the sounds of the letters in column  1, and only whisper in those of column 2. Give the sound of any letter in  column 1, as _b, g, v_, and the last or vanishing part of it is the sound  of the other letter of the pair.    TO THE TEACHER.--Write these letters on the board, as above, and drill the  pupils on the sounds till they can see and make these distinctions. Drill  them on the vowels also.    In closing this talk with you, we wish to emphasize one point brought  before you. Here is a pencil, a real thing; we carry in memory a picture of  the pencil, which we call an idea; and there are the two words naming this  idea, the spoken and the written. Learn to distinguish clearly these four  things.    TO THE TEACHER.--In reviewing these three Lessons, put particular emphasis  on Lesson 2.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 4.    ANALYSIS AND THE DIAGRAM.    TO THE TEACHER.--If the pupils have been through \"Graded Lessons\" or its  equivalent, some of the following Lessons may be passed over rapidly.    +DEFINITION.--A _Sentence_ is the expression of a thought in words+.    +Direction+.--_Analyze the following sentences_:--    +Model+.--_Spiders spin_. Why is this a sentence? Ans.--Because it  expresses a thought. Of what is something thought? Ans.--Spiders. Which  word tells what is thought? Ans.--_Spin_. [Footnote: The word _spiders_,  standing in Roman, names our idea of the real thing; _spin_, used merely as  a word, is in Italics. This use of Italics the teacher and the pupil will  please note here and elsewhere.]    1. Tides ebb.  2. Liquids flow.  3. Steam expands.  4. Carbon burns.  5. Iron melts.  6. Powder explodes.  7. Leaves tremble.  8. Worms crawl.  9. Hares leap.    In each of these sentences there are, as you have learned, two parts--the  +Subject+ and the +Predicate+.    +DEFINITION.--The _Subject of a sentence_ names that of which something is  thought.+    +DEFINITION.--The _Predicate of a sentence_ tells what is thought.+    +DEFINITION.--The _Analysis of a sentence_ is the separation of it into its  parts.+    +Direction+.--_Analyze these sentences_:--    +Model+.--_Beavers build_. This is a sentence because it expresses a  thought. _Beavers_ is the subject because it names that of which something  is thought; _build_ is the predicate because it tells what is thought.  [Footnote: When pupils are familiar with the definitions, let the form of  analysis be varied. The reasons may be made more specific. Here and  elsewhere avoid mechanical repetition.]    1. Squirrels climb.  2. Blood circulates.  3. Muscles tire.  4. Heralds proclaim.  5. Apes chatter.  6. Branches wave.  7. Corn ripens.  8. Birds twitter.  9. Hearts throb.    +Explanation+.--Draw a heavy line and divide it into two parts. Let the  first part represent the subject of a sentence; the second, the predicate.    If you write a word over the first part, you will understand that this word  is the subject of a sentence. If you write a word over the second part, you  will understand that this word is the predicate of a sentence.      Love  |  conquers  ========|============          |    You see, by looking at this figure, that _Love conquers_ is a sentence;  that _love_ is the subject, and _conquers_ the predicate.    Such figures, made up of straight lines, we call _Diagrams_.    +DEFINITION.--A _Diagram_ is a picture of the offices and the relations of  the different parts of a sentence.+    +Direction+.--_Analyze these sentences_:--    1. Frogs croak.  2. Hens sit.  3. Sheep bleat.  4. Cows low.  5. Flies buzz.  6. Sap ascends.  7. Study pays.  8. Buds swell.  9. Books aid.  10. Noise disturbs.  11. Hope strengthens.  12. Cocks crow.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 5.    COMPOSITION--SUBJECT AND PREDICATE.    +CAPITAL LETTER--RULE.--The first word of every sentence must begin with a  _capital letter_+.    +PERIOD--RULE.--A _period_ must be placed after every sentence that simply  affirms, denies, or commands.+    +Direction+.--_Construct sentences by supplying a subject to each of the  following predicates_:--    Ask yourselves the questions, What tarnishes? Who sailed, conquered, etc.?    1. ----- tarnishes.  2. ----- capsize.  3. ----- radiates.  4. ----- sentence.  5. ----- careen.  6. ----- sailed.  7. ----- descends.  8. ----- glisten.  9. ----- absorb.  10. ----- corrode.  11. ----- conquered.  12. ----- surrendered.  13. ----- refines.  14. ----- gurgle.  15. ----- murmur.    +Direction+.--_Construct sentences by supplying a predicate to each of the  following "]]]
