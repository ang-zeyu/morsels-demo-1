[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6840"],[0,"Queen Lucia (#3)"],[1,"busy,\" she said  with strict impartiality, \"for if being busy was a crime, I am sure  there are few of us here who would escape hanging. But take my life  here, or yours for that matter. Well, mine if you like. Often and often  I am alone from breakfast till lunch-time, but in those hours I get  through more that is worth doing than London gets through in a day and  a night. I have an hour at my music not looking about and wondering who  my neighbours are, but learning, studying, drinking in divine melody.  Then I have my letters to write, and you know what that means, and I  still have time for an hour's reading so that when you come to tell me  lunch is ready, you will find that I have been wandering through  Venetian churches or sitting in that little dark room at Weimar, or was  it Leipsic? How would those same hours have passed in London?    \"Sitting perhaps for half an hour in the Park, with dearest Aggie  pointing out to me, with thrills of breathless excitement, a woman who  was in the divorce court, or a coroneted bankrupt. Then she would drag  me off to some terrible private view full of the same people all  staring at and gabbling to each other, or looking at pictures that made  poor me gasp and shudder. No, I am thankful to be back at my own sweet  Riseholme again. I can work and think here.\"    She looked round the panelled entrance-hall with a glow of warm content  at being at home again that quite eclipsed the mere physical heat  produced by her walk from the station. Wherever her eyes fell, those  sharp dark eyes that resembled buttons covered with shiny American  cloth, they saw nothing that jarred, as so much in London jarred. There  were bright brass jugs on the window sill, a bowl of pot-pourri on the  black table in the centre, an oak settee by the open fireplace, a  couple of Persian rugs on the polished floor. The room had its  quaintness, too, such as she had alluded to in her memorable essay read  before the Riseholme Literary Society, called \"Humour in Furniture,\"  and a brass milkcan served as a receptacle for sticks and umbrellas.  Equally quaint was the dish of highly realistic stone fruit that stood  beside the pot-pourri and the furry Japanese spider that sprawled in a  silk web over the window.    Such was the fearful verisimilitude of this that Lucia's new housemaid  had once fled from her duties in the early morning, to seek the  assistance of the gardener in killing it. The dish of stone fruit had  scored a similar success, for once she had said to Georgie Pillson,  \"Ah, my gardener has sent in some early apples and pears, won't you  take one home with you?\" It was not till the weight of the pear (he  swiftly selected the largest) betrayed the joke that he had any notion  that they were not real ones. But then Georgie had had his revenge, for  waiting his opportunity he had inserted a real pear among those stony  specimens and again passing through with Lucia, he picked it out, and  with lips drawn back had snapped at it with all the force of his jaws.  For the moment she had felt quite faint at the thought of his teeth  crashing into fragments.... These humorous touches were altered from  time to time; the spider for instance might be taken down and replaced  by a china canary in a Chippendale cage, and the selection of the  entrance hall for those whimsicalities was intentional, for guests  found something to smile at, as they took off their cloaks and entered  the drawing room with a topic on their lips, something light, something  amusing about what they had seen. For the gong similarly was sometimes  substituted a set of bells that had once decked the collar of the  leading horse in a waggoner's team somewhere in Flanders; in fact when  Lucia was at home there was often a new little quaintness for quite a  sequence of days, and she had held out hopes to the Literary Society  that perhaps some day, when she was not so rushed, she would jot down  material for a sequel to her essay, or write another covering a rather  larger field on \"The Gambits of Conversation Derived from Furniture.\"    On the table there was a pile of letters waiting for Mrs Lucas, for  yesterday's post had not been forwarded her, for fear of its missing  her--London postmen were probably very careless and untrustworthy--and  she gave a little cry of dismay as she saw the volume of her  correspondence.    \"But I shall be very naughty,\" she said \"and not look at one of them  till after lunch. Take them away, _Caro_, and promise me to lock  them up till then, and not give them me however much I beg. Then I will  get into the saddle again, such a dear saddle, too, and tackle them. I  shall have a stroll in the garden till the bell rings. What is it that  Nietzsche says about the necessity to _mediterranizer_ yourself  every now and then? I must _Riseholme_ myself.\"    Peppino remembered the quotation, which had occurred in a review of some  work of that celebrated author, where Lucia had also seen it, and went  back, with the force of contrast to aid him, to his prose-poem of  \"Loneliness,\" while his wife went through the smoking-parlour into the  garden, in order to soak herself once more in the cultured atmosphere.    In this garden behind the house there was no attempt to construct a  Shakespearian plot, for, as she so rightly observed, Shakespeare, who  loved flowers so well, would wish her to enjoy every conceivable  horticultural treasure. But furniture played a prominent part in the  place, and there were statues and sundials and stone-seats scattered  about with almost too profuse a hand. Mottos also were in great  evidence, and while a sundial reminded you that \"_Tempus fugit,_\"  an enticing resting-place somewhat bewilderingly bade you to \"Bide a  wee.\" But then again the rustic seat in the pleached alley of laburnums  had carved on its back, \"Much have I travelled in the realms of gold,\"  so that, meditating on Keats, you could bide a wee with a clear  conscience. Indeed so copious was the wealth of familiar and  stimulating quotations that one of her subjects had once said that to  stroll in Lucia's garden was not only to enjoy her lovely flowers, but  to spend a simultaneous half hour with the best authors. There was a  dovecote of course, but since the cats always killed the doves, Mrs  Lucas had put up round the desecrated home several pigeons of  Copenhagen china, which were both imperishable as regards cats, and  also carried out the suggestion of humour in furniture. The humour had  attained the highest point of felicity when Peppino concealed a  mechanical nightingale in a bush, which sang \"Jug-jug\" in the most  realistic manner when you pulled a string. Georgie had not yet seen the  Copenhagen pigeons, or being rather short-sighted thought they were  real. Then, oh then, Peppino pulled the string, and for quite a long  time Georgie listened entranced to their melodious cooings. That served  him out for his \"trap\" about the real pear introduced among the stone  specimens. For in spite of the rarefied atmosphere of culture at  Riseholme, Riseholme knew how to \"_desipere in loco_,\" and its  strenuous culture was often refreshed by these light refined touches.    Mrs Lucas walked quickly and decisively up and down the paths as she  waited for the summons to lunch, for the activity of her mind reacted  on her body, making her brisk in movement. On each side of her forehead  were hard neat undulations of black hair that concealed the tips of her  ears. She had laid aside her London hat, and carried a red cotton  Contadina's umbrella, which threw a rosy glow onto the oval of her thin  face and its colourless complexion. She bore the weight of her forty  years extremely lightly, and but for the droop of skin at the corners  of her mouth, she might have passed as a much younger woman. Her face  was otherwise unlined and bore no trace of the ravages of emotional  living, which both ages and softens. Certainly there was nothing soft  about her, and very little of the signs of age, and it would have been  reasonable to conjecture that twenty years later she would look but  little older than she did today. For such emotions as she was victim of  were the sterile and ageless emotions of art; such desires as beset her  were not connected with her affections, but her ambitions. Dynasty she  had none, for she was childless, and thus her ambitions were limited to  the permanence and security of her own throne as queen of Riseholme. She  really asked nothing more of life than the continuance of such harvests  as she had so plenteously reaped for these last ten years. As long as  she directed the life of Riseholme, took the lead in its culture and  entertainment, and was the undisputed fountain-head of all its  inspirations, and from time to time refreshed her memory as to the  utter inferiority of London she wanted nothing more. But to secure  that she dedicated all that she had of ease, leisure and income.  Being practically indefatigable the loss of ease and leisure troubled  her but little and being in extremely comfortable circumstances, she  had no need to economise in her hospitalities. She might easily look  forward to enjoying an unchanging middle-aged activity, while  generations of youth withered round her, and no star, remotely rising,  had as yet threatened to dim her unrivalled effulgence. Though  essentially autocratic, her subjects were allowed and even encouraged  to develop their own minds on their own lines, provided always that  those lines met at the junction where she was station-master. With  regard to religion finally, it may be briefly said that she believed  in God in much the same way as she believed in Australia, for she had  no doubt whatever as to the existence of either, and she went to church  on Sunday in much the same spirit as she would look at a kangaroo in the  Zoological Gardens, for kangaroos come from Australia.
