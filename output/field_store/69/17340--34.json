Pushing her bold  waters through this somewhat inferior lake, the St. Lawrence pursues  her course seaward with impetuosity, until arrested near La Chine by  rock-studded shallows, which produce those strong currents and eddies,  the dangers of which are so beautifully expressed in the Canadian Boat  Song,--a composition that has rendered the \"rapids\" almost as familiar  to the imagination of the European as the falls of Niagara themselves.  Beyond La Chine the St. Lawrence gradually unfolds herself into greater  majesty and expanse, and rolling past the busy commercial town of  Montreal, is once more increased in volume by the insignificant lake of  St. Peter's, nearly opposite to the settlement of Three Rivers, midway  between Montreal and Quebec. From thence she pursues her course unfed,  except by a few inferior streams, and gradually widens as she rolls  past the capital of the Canadas, whose tall and precipitous  battlements, bristled with cannon, and frowning defiance from the  clouds in which they appear half imbedded, might be taken by the  imaginative enthusiast for the strong tower of the Spirit of those  stupendous scenes. From this point the St. Lawrence increases in  expanse, until, at length, after traversing a country where the traces  of civilisation become gradually less and less visible, she finally  merges in the gulf, from the centre of which the shores on either hand  are often invisible to the naked eye; and in this manner is it  imperceptibly lost in that misty ocean, so dangerous to mariners from  its deceptive and almost perpetual fogs.    In following the links of this extensive chain of lakes and rivers, it  must be borne in recollection, that, proceeding seaward from  Michilimackinac and its contiguous district, all that tract of country  which lies to the right constitutes what is now known as the United  States of America, and all on the left the two provinces of Upper and  Lower Canada, tributary to the English government, subject to the  English laws, and garrisoned by English troops. The several forts and  harbours established along the left bank of the St. Lawrence, and  throughout that portion of our possessions which is known as Lower  Canada, are necessarily, from the improved condition and more numerous  population of that province, on a larger scale and of better  appointment; but in Upper Canada, where the traces of civilisation are  less evident throughout, and become gradually more faint as we advance  westward, the fortresses and harbours bear the same proportion In  strength and extent to the scantiness of the population they are  erected to protect. Even at the present day, along that line of remote  country we have selected for the theatre of our labours, the garrisons  are both few in number and weak in strength, and evidence of  cultivation is seldom to be found at any distance in the interior; so  that all beyond a certain extent of clearing, continued along the banks  of the lakes and rivers, is thick, impervious, rayless forest, the  limits of which have never yet been explored, perhaps, by the natives  themselves.    Such being the general features of the country even at the present day,  it will readily be comprehended how much more wild and desolate was the  character they exhibited as far back as the middle of the last century,  about which period our story commences. At that epoch, it will be borne  in mind, what we have described as being the United States were then  the British colonies of America dependent on the mother-country; while  the Canadas, on the contrary, were, or had very recently been, under  the dominion of France, from whom they had been wrested after a long  struggle, greatly advanced in favour of England by the glorious battle  fought on the plains of Abraham, near Quebec, and celebrated for the  defeat of Montcalm and the death of Wolfe.    The several attempts made to repossess themselves of the strong hold of  Quebec having, in every instance, been met by discomfiture and  disappointment, the French, in despair, relinquished the contest, and,  by treaty, ceded their claims to the Canadas,--an event that was  hastened by the capitulation of the garrison of Montreal, commanded by  the Marquis de Vaudreuil, to the victorious arms of General Amherst.  Still, though conquered as a people, many of the leading men in the  country, actuated by that jealousy for which they were remarkable,  contrived to oppose obstacles to the quiet possession of a conquest by  those whom they seemed to look upon as their hereditary enemies; and in  furtherance of this object, paid agents, men of artful and intriguing  character, were dispersed among the numerous tribes of savages, with a  view of exciting them to acts of hostility against their conquerors.  The long and uninterrupted possession, by the French, of those  countries immediately bordering on the hunting grounds and haunts of  the natives, with whom they carried on an extensive traffic in furs,  had established a communionship of interest between themselves and  those savage and warlike people, which failed not to turn to account  the vindictive views of the former. The whole of the province of Upper  Canada at that time possessed but a scanty population, protected in its  most flourishing and defensive points by stockade forts; the chief  object of which was to secure the garrisons, consisting each of a few  companies, from any sudden surprise on the part of the natives, who,  although apparently inclining to acknowledge the change of neighbours,  and professing amity, were, it was well known, too much in the interest  of their old friends the French, and even the French Canadians  themselves, not to be regarded with the most cautious distrust.    These stockade forts were never, at any one period, nearer to each  other than from one hundred and fifty to two hundred miles, so that, in  the event of surprise or alarm, there was little prospect of obtaining  assistance from without. Each garrison, therefore, was almost wholly  dependent on its own resources; and, when surrounded unexpectedly by  numerous bands of hostile Indians, had no other alternative than to  hold out to the death. Capitulation was out of the question; for,  although the wile and artifice of the natives might induce them to  promise mercy, the moment their enemies were in their power promises  and treaties were alike broken, and indiscriminate massacre ensued.  Communication by water was, except during a period of profound peace,  almost impracticable; for, although of late years the lakes of Canada  have been covered with vessels of war, many of them, as we have already  remarked, of vast magnitude, and been the theatres of conflicts that  would not have disgraced the salt waters of ocean itself, at the period  to which our story refers the flag of England was seen to wave only on  the solitary mast of some ill-armed and ill-manned gunboat, employed  rather for the purpose of conveying despatches from fort to fort, than  with any serious view to acts either of aggression or defence.    In proportion as the colonies of America, now the United States, pushed  their course of civilisation westward, in the same degree did the  numerous tribes of Indians, who had hitherto dwelt more seaward, retire  upon those of their own countrymen, who, buried in vast and  impenetrable forests, had seldom yet seen the face of the European  stranger; so that, in the end, all the more central parts of those  stupendous wilds became doubly peopled. Hitherto, however, that  civilisation had not been carried beyond the state of New York; and all  those countries which have, since the American revolution, been added  to the Union under the names of Kentucky, Ohio, Missouri, Michigan,  &c., were, at the period embraced by our story, inhospitable and  unproductive woods, subject only to the dominion of the native, and as  yet unshorn by the axe of the cultivator. A few portions only of the  opposite shores of Michigan were occupied by emigrants from the  Canadas, who, finding no one to oppose or molest them, selected the  most fertile spots along the banks of the river; and of the existence  of these infant settlements, the English colonists, who had never  ventured so far, were not even aware until after the conquest of Canada  by the mother-country. This particular district was the centre around  which the numerous warriors, who had been driven westward by the  colonists, had finally assembled; and rude villages and encampments  rose far and near for a circuit of many miles around this infant  settlement and fort of the Canadians, to both of which they had given  the name of Detroit, after the river on whose elevated banks they  stood. Proceeding westward from this point, and along the tract of  country that diverged from the banks of the Lakes Huron, Sinclair, and  Michigan, all traces of that partial civilisation were again lost in  impervious wilds, tenanted only by the fiercest of the Indian tribes,  whose homes were principally along the banks of that greatest of  American waters, the Lake Superior, and in the country surrounding the  isolated fort of Michilimackinac, the last and most remote of the  European fortresses in Canada.    When at a later period the Canadas were ceded to us by France, those  parts of the opposite frontier which we have just described became also  tributary to the English crown, and were, by the peculiar difficulties  that existed to communication with the more central and populous  districts, rendered especially favourable to the exercise of hostile  intrigue by the numerous active French emissaries every where dispersed  among the Indian tribes. During the first few years of the conquest,  the inhabitants of Canada, who were all either European French, or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49131"],[0,"Wings over England (#3)"],[1,"afraid!\"    \"But the playhouse is all blowed up.\" Tillie dabbed at her eyes.    \"Yes!\" exclaimed Peggy, dancing a jig. \"But were we bombed! And was it  exciting! Just like fireworks! Only bigger! Much louder! There was  smoke, and then Oops! Up went everything!\"    In vast astonishment Cherry stared at this small bit of humanity from  the slums of London. Her eyes were on the child for a full minute. Then,  mustering up her courage she managed a low chuckle. Then, springing to  her feet, she cried: \"Come on! Let's go see! We'll make it a race!\" And  so the four of them, three girls and a dog, went racing away.    When at last they stood by the ruins of what had once been a grand  playhouse, almost a living thing to her, Cherry was ready to weep.    How very much that playhouse had meant to her! It was only an abandoned  smoke-house, with the pleasant odor of burning wood and smoking meat  still clinging to it, but she had made of it a sort of second home. What  grand times she and Alice had known there! And of late, how Tillie and  Peggy had gloried in it! They had called it \"Home of our Dolls.\"    \"The dolls!\" Cherry exclaimed as she recalled it all. \"Where are they?\"    As if in answer to her appeal, the dog, Flash, went racing about to  return almost at once with the remains of a doll held lightly between  his teeth.    \"Oh! Poor Wilhelmina!\" Peggy cried. \"She has lost her head!\"    \"Yes,\" said a sober voice behind her. \"And if those terrible Nazis had  succeeded as they hoped to, in dropping a bomb on our house you and I  would have been minus our heads too.\" It was a tall, strongly built girl  in her late teens who spoke. She wore a blue calico apron. Her hands  were white with flour.    \"Alice!\" Cherry demanded, as a look of terror came into her eyes. \"Do  you really think they meant to bomb the house?\"    \"Of course they did!\"    \"Why? What have we done?\"    \"They did it because we belong to England. They hate all of England.  They will destroy every bit of England if they can!\" The girl's voice  rose. \"But they can't! They shall not. There will always be an England!\"    At that moment the plain, strongly built girl with flour on her hands  appeared transformed. No Joan of Arc could have looked stronger, more  daring, than she.    Cherry looked at the headless doll and was silent.    In the meantime, racing breathlessly, the two boys watched the drifting  of the white enemy parachutes across the sky. It had seemed at first  that they would land not so far from the spot where they had stood. But  a brisk wind carried them farther and farther away.    \"It's going to be a race,\" Brand panted, \"but we've just got to make it.  They may--may be spies. They--they must not escape!\"    After climbing the sloping pasture they came to a place of scattered  shrubs and trees. At last the parachute nearest them vanished behind a  broad beech-tree.    \"Come on!\" Dave spurted ahead. \"It's now or never!\"    At last, bursting out from behind a clump of trees they came upon a  silken bag lying on the ground. At the same time a dark shadow vanished  into a clump of low shrubs. Without a word the boys separated, one going  right, the other left. The clump was small. One or the other would come  upon the man. And then--    It was Brand's luck to meet the man face to face. He was young,--not  more than two years Brand's senior. There was a savage, haunted look on  his face.    \"All right!\" he growled, showing his teeth like an angry dog, \"You asked  for it. You get it!\" All this in guttural English. An automatic gleamed  in his hand. The English boy did not move.    The automatic rose, jerkily but steadily. Now it was aimed at the boy's  feet,--now at his thigh--his belt--and now--    At that instant something with the force of an avalanche struck the Nazi  flier across the knees. As he went crashing to earth the automatic  exploded harmlessly, then fell into the tall grass. Ten seconds later  both Brand and Dave were holding the man down, as Brand panted:    \"Tha--that was a capital stroke, Dave! I sup--suppose you'd call that a  tackle!\"    \"Right,\" Dave agreed. \"It's really quite old stuff. They do it in the  movies. I guess you'd call it a part of our American way of living.\" He  laughed softly.    Brand went over the Nazi flier for weapons. Finding none, he searched in  the grass, found the automatic, then turning about, said:    \"You may get up.\"    The reply was an ugly snarl. But the man, who wore a pilot's insignia,  stood up.    \"Mind leading the way?\" Brand said to Dave.    \"Certainly not.\" Turning his back on the prisoner Dave started toward  the farmhouse.    \"All right, you. March!\" Brand snapped. The prisoner followed Dave.    With Brand bringing up the rear, they had not gone a dozen paces when  from somewhere, not far distant, there came a most astounding roar.    Starting in sudden shock, Brand all but dropped his weapon.    \"Wha--what's that?\" Dave's voice trembled as he came to a dead stop.    \"That's old Jock! Something terrible is happening. Here!\" Brand thrust  the automatic into Dave's hand. \"You know how to use it. Press the  handle, that's all. March him down into the pasture. Don't hesitate to  shoot. This is war--our war!\" He was gone. As he dashed through the  brush, Brand felt his blood fairly boiling in his veins. \"If anything  serious has happened to good old Jock,\" he thought savagely, \"if one of  those devils harms the old man I'll tear him to pieces with my bare  hands!\"    Since no further sound reached him, guided only by that one agonizing  roar, he made his way as best he could along the slope. Then breaking  through a cluster of young beech-trees, he stopped short to stare. The  little tableau before him seemed unreal. It might have been taken from  some picture.    A young man dressed in civilian clothes, minus a coat, lay flat upon the  ground. His eyes gleaming, white teeth showing in a snarl, a golden  collie lay with his fore-paws on the prostrate man's chest. Over them,  leaning on his crutch, towered a great gray-haired one-legged Scot. He  was saying: \"Keep 'im Flash! Don't ye let 'im stir an inch!\"    At the same moment, from the pasture below came the confused murmur of  many voices. This was followed by a shout: \"Come on, men. They're 'iding  up 'ere somewheres!\"                                        _Chapter IV_                                Hans Schlitz      While the sound of voices from below grew louder, Jock said in a steady  voice:    \"He was changin' to civies.\"    \"His uniform must be hidden somewhere close,\" suggested Dave.    \"Aye. That it must,\" Jock agreed.    Brand was not long in locating the uniform half hidden by dead leaves.  In a pocket he found an automatic.    \"It's good he didn't have that in his hand,\" said the sturdy Scot, \"else  I shouldn't ha'e been here. I caught him doin' the lightnin' change act.    \"Plannin' to do the spy act, eh?\" He spoke to the man on the ground. The  answer was a surly curse.    \"All right.\" Brand spoke quietly to the dog. \"Let him up.\"    Flash looked at Jock, read an answer in his eyes, then left his post.    \"Get up.\" There was a sound like clinking steel in the English lad's  voice.    \"He knocked me over,\" Jock explained quietly. \"That was easy enough, an'  me with but one leg. Then he went on to finish me off. He's got  astonishin' strong hands, that lad has. He's all for shakin' a man. If  it hadn't been fer good auld Flash now--\"    \"He would have killed you.\" Chilled hate was in Brand's voice.    All of a sudden hands parted the branches of a small oak and there stood  the brawny blacksmith from Warmington, the village below Ramsey Farm. He  carried an antique fowling-piece.    \"So you got one of 'em? That's grand, me boys!\" he approved. \"Where now  would you say the others be?\"    By that time a dozen members of the Home Guard had gathered in.    \"My friend from America, David Barnes, has one of them just up here a  little way,\" Brand replied.    \"I'll say you've done a fine job of it,\" the blacksmith approved.    \"And now then.\" He turned to the prisoner. \"What may your name be?\" He  drew pencil and notebook from his pocket.    For a moment the Nazi stood sullenly silent.    \"Come now,\" the blacksmith insisted. \"It's part of the regulations.\"    \"Hans Schlitz,\" came in a low, defiant voice.    \"Hans Schlitz!\" The words sprang unbidden from Brand's voice. \"That's  the name of the prisoner who worked on our farm during the World War!\"    \"I'm his son,\" the prisoner snarled. \"I've paid you a visit to square  accounts. I'm sorry we missed.\"    \"So you meant to bomb our house!\" Brand stared almost in unbelief.    \"Why not? Your father treated my father, a prisoner of war, like a dog.\"    \"That,\" said the gray-haired blacksmith, \"is not the truth. I mind it  well. He was housed and fed as one of the family. He worked no harder  than the men of the household. He--\"    \"That's a lie!\" the prisoner snarled. A crimson flush o'erspread the  giant blacksmith's face. He took a step forward. Then he muttered  low--\"No. It won't do. Not at all it won't do. Not to be brawlin' with a  swine like him.\"    He stood there for a moment, head bowed as if in prayer. Then his head  lifted as he said:    \"Here you, Bill and Hugh, take this fellow to the guard house.    \"The rest of you,\" he waved an arm, \"spread out an' search for the one  that's still free. There was three of them, you all mind countin'.\"    There was a murmur of assent. Then they were away. \"Come on,\" Brand said  to Dave after the first man they had captured had been turned over to  the blacksmith and a companion. \"All this leaves me a bit groggy. Think  of their deliberately planning to blow our house off the map!\"    \"Terrible!\" Dave agreed.    \"And my father did treat that prisoner well,\" Brand said. \"I remember  his telling of it many times. We saw where their plane cracked up.\"  Brand's voice rose. \"Finding that plane is important. That third fellow  may"]]]
