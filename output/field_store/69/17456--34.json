About this spinning of hers I will tell you more another time.    Guess what she was spinning.        CHAPTER 4    What the Nurse Thought of It    'Why, where can you have been, princess?' asked the nurse, taking her  in her arms.  'It's very unkind of you to hide away so long. I began to  be afraid--'  Here she checked herself.    'What were you afraid of, nursie?' asked the princess.    'Never mind,' she answered.  'Perhaps I will tell you another day. Now  tell me where you have been.'    'I've been up a long way to see my very great, huge, old grandmother,'  said the princess.    'What do you mean by that?' asked the nurse, who thought she was making  fun.    'I mean that I've been a long way up and up to see My GREAT  grandmother.  Ah, nursie, you don't know what a beautiful mother of  grandmothers I've got upstairs.  She is such an old lady, with such  lovely white hair--as white as my silver cup.  Now, when I think of it,  I think her hair must be silver.'    'What nonsense you are talking, princess!' said the nurse.    'I'm not talking nonsense,' returned Irene, rather offended.  'I will  tell you all about her.  She's much taller than you, and much prettier.'    'Oh, I dare say!' remarked the nurse.    'And she lives upon pigeons' eggs.'    'Most likely,' said the nurse.    'And she sits in an empty room, spin-spinning all day long.'    'Not a doubt of it,' said the nurse.    'And she keeps her crown in her bedroom.'    'Of course--quite the proper place to keep her crown in.  She wears it  in bed, I'll be bound.'    'She didn't say that.  And I don't think she does.  That wouldn't be  comfortable--would it?  I don't think my papa wears his crown for a  night-cap.  Does he, nursie?'    'I never asked him.  I dare say he does.'    'And she's been there ever since I came here--ever so many years.'    'Anybody could have told you that,' said the nurse, who did not believe  a word Irene was saying.    'Why didn't you tell me, then?'    'There was no necessity.  You could make it all up for yourself.'    'You don't believe me, then!' exclaimed the princess, astonished and  angry, as she well might be.    'Did you expect me to believe you, princess?' asked the nurse coldly.  'I know princesses are in the habit of telling make-believes, but you  are the first I ever heard of who expected to have them believed,' she  added, seeing that the child was strangely in earnest.    The princess burst into tears.    'Well, I must say,' remarked the nurse, now thoroughly vexed with her  for crying, 'it is not at all becoming in a princess to tell stories  and expect to be believed just because she is a princess.'    'But it's quite true, I tell you.'    'You've dreamt it, then, child.'    'No, I didn't dream it.  I went upstairs, and I lost myself, and if I  hadn't found the beautiful lady, I should never have found myself.'    'Oh, I dare say!'    'Well, you just come up with me, and see if I'm not telling the truth.'    'Indeed I have other work to do.  It's your dinnertime, and I won't  have any more such nonsense.'    The princess wiped her eyes, and her face grew so hot that they were  soon quite dry.  She sat down to her dinner, but ate next to nothing.  Not to be believed does not at all agree with princesses: for a real  princess cannot tell a lie.  So all the afternoon she did not speak a  word.  Only when the nurse spoke to her, she answered her, for a real  princess is never rude--even when she does well to be offended.    Of course the nurse was not comfortable in her mind--not that she  suspected the least truth in Irene's story, but that she loved her  dearly, and was vexed with herself for having been cross to her. She  thought her crossness was the cause of the princess's unhappiness, and  had no idea that she was really and deeply hurt at not being believed.  But, as it became more and more plain during the evening in her every  motion and look, that, although she tried to amuse herself with her  toys, her heart was too vexed and troubled to enjoy them, her nurse's  discomfort grew and grew.  When bedtime came, she undressed and laid  her down, but the child, instead of holding up her little mouth to be  kissed, turned away from her and lay still.  Then nursie's heart gave  way altogether, and she began to cry.  At the sound of her first sob  the princess turned again, and held her face to kiss her as usual.  But  the nurse had her handkerchief to her eyes, and did not see the  movement.    'Nursie,' said the princess, 'why won't you believe me?'    'Because I can't believe you,' said the nurse, getting angry again.    'Ah! then, you can't help it,' said Irene, 'and I will not be vexed  with you any more.  I will give you a kiss and go to sleep.'    'You little angel!' cried the nurse, and caught her out of bed, and  walked about the room with her in her arms, kissing and hugging her.    'You will let me take you to see my dear old great big grandmother,  won't you?' said the princess, as she laid her down again.    'And you won't say I'm ugly, any more--will you, princess?' 'Nursie, I  never said you were ugly.  What can you mean?'    'Well, if you didn't say it, you meant it.'    'Indeed, I never did.'    'You said I wasn't so pretty as that--'    'As my beautiful grandmother--yes, I did say that; and I say it again,  for it's quite true.'    'Then I do think you are unkind!' said the nurse, and put her  handkerchief to her eyes again.    'Nursie, dear, everybody can't be as beautiful as every other body, you  know.  You are very nice-looking, but if you had been as beautiful as  my grandmother--'    'Bother your grandmother!' said the nurse.    'Nurse, that's very rude.  You are not fit to be spoken to till you can  behave better.'    The princess turned away once more, and again the nurse was ashamed of  herself.    'I'm sure I beg your pardon, princess,' she said, though still in an  offended tone.  But the princess let the tone pass, and heeded only the  words.    'You won't say it again, I am sure,' she answered, once more turning  towards her nurse.  'I was only going to say that if you had been twice  as nice-looking as you are, some king or other would have married you,  and then what would have become of me?'    'You are an angel!' repeated the nurse, again embracing her. 'Now,'  insisted Irene, 'you will come and see my grandmother--won't you?'    'I will go with you anywhere you like, my cherub,' she answered; and in  two minutes the weary little princess was fast asleep.        CHAPTER 5    The Princess Lets Well Alone    When she woke the next morning, the first thing she heard was the rain  still falling.  Indeed, this day was so like the last that it would  have been difficult to tell where was the use of It.  The first thing  she thought of, however, was not the rain, but the lady in the tower;  and the first question that occupied her thoughts was whether she  should not ask the nurse to fulfil her promise this very morning, and  go with her to find her grandmother as soon as she had had her  breakfast.  But she came to the conclusion that perhaps the lady would  not be pleased if she took anyone to see her without first asking  leave; especially as it was pretty evident, seeing she lived on  pigeons' eggs, and cooked them herself, that she did not want the  household to know she was there.  So the princess resolved to take the  first opportunity of running up alone and asking whether she might  bring her nurse.  She believed the fact that she could not otherwise  convince her she was telling the truth would have much weight with her  grandmother.    The princess and her nurse were the best of friends all dressing-time,  and the princess in consequence ate an enormous little breakfast.    'I wonder, Lootie'--that was her pet name for her nurse--'what pigeons'  eggs taste like?' she said, as she was eating her egg--not quite a  common one, for they always picked out the pinky ones for her.    'We'll get you a pigeon's egg, and you shall judge for yourself,' said  the nurse.    'Oh, no, no!' returned Irene, suddenly reflecting they might disturb  the old lady in getting it, and that even if they did not, she would  have one less in consequence.    'What a strange creature you are,' said the nurse--'first to want a  thing and then to refuse it!'    But she did not say it crossly, and the princess never minded any  remarks that were not unfriendly.    'Well, you see, Lootie, there are reasons,' she returned, and said no  more, for she did not want to bring up the subject of their former  strife, lest her nurse should offer to go before she had had her  grandmother's permission to bring her.  Of course she could refuse to  take her, but then she would believe her less than ever.    Now the nurse, as she said herself afterwards, could not be every  moment in the room; and as never before yesterday had the princess  given her the smallest reason for anxiety, it had not yet come into her  head to watch her more closely.  So she soon gave her a chance, and,  the very first that offered, Irene was off and up the stairs again.    This day's adventure, however, did not turn out like yesterday's,  although it began like it; and indeed to-day is very seldom like  yesterday, if people would note the differences--even when it rains.  The princess ran through passage after passage, and could not find the  stair of the tower.  My own suspicion is that she had not gone up high  enough, and was searching on the second instead of the third floor.  When she turned to go back, she failed equally in her search after the  stair.  She was lost once more.    Something made it even worse to bear this time, and it was no wonder  that she cried again.  Suddenly it occurred to her that it was after  having "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7099"],[0,"A Trip to Manitoba (#3)"],[1," again.\"          CHAPTER II.    Saulte Ste. Marie--Indian Embroidery--Lake Superior--Preaching, Singing,  and Card-playing--Silver Islet--Thunder Bay--The Dog River--Flowers at  Fort William--\"Forty Miles of Ice\"--Icebergs and Warm  Breezes--Duluth--Hotel Belles--Bump of Destructiveness in Porters.      The scenery just before entering the St. Mary River, which unites Lake  Huron and Lake Superior, is very fine. As the steamer threaded the group  of islands with their high, rocky, picturesquely wooded shores, we were  sometimes near enough to distinguish the many varieties of mosses and  ferns just springing into life; then, steaming across the rippling water,  we reached some point whose distant beauty had made us long to carry away  more than a memory of its outlines; and so, winding in and out amongst  the islands of this North American archipelago, we \"fetched\" the Saulte  Ste. Marie about sunset. [Footnote: The island-studded northern expanse  of Lake Huron is known as Georgian Bay. As the level of Lake Superior is  between thirty and forty feet higher than that of Lake Huron, there is a  corresponding fall at the head of the St. Mary River. This difference of  level prevents direct navigation between the two lakes; consequently, the  Americans have constructed across the extreme north-eastern point of the  State of Michigan a fine canal, which gives them exclusive possession of  the entrance by water to the great inland sea of Lake Superior. When, in  1870, the Red River Expedition, under Colonel (now General Sir) Garnet  Wolseley, sought to make the passage in several steamboats _en  route_ for Thunder Bay, the State authorities of Michigan issued a  prohibition against it. Fortunately, the Cabinet of Washington overruled  this prohibition, and the Expedition was permitted to pass; not, however,  until valuable time had been lost. Considering the importance of this  canal to the Dominion Government, and that at a crisis the United States'  Cabinet could close Lake Superior to our vessels of war, I think some  steps should be taken by which the Imperial Government would become joint  proprietors of the canal, with an equal share in its management at all  times.] The \"Saulte,\" as it is generally called, is a pretty little  village, situated at the foot of a hill on the north shore of the canal.  Having to remain an hour there, we went ashore, up the long straight  street, to a frame-house, or store, where there was an extensive display  of Indian work. The Lake Superior and Huron Red Indians are particularly  noted for the beauty of their embroidery on skins, silk, birch bark, and  cloth, in beads, porcupine quills, or silk. Their imitative genius is so  great that the squaws can copy anything, and I know people who have had  their crests and coats-of-arms embroidered upon their tobacco-pouches  and belts, from an impression on paper or sealing-wax. Generally they  copy flowers and ferns, invent their own patterns, or, what seems even  more wonderful, make them by chewing a piece of bark into the form they  require--the bark assuming the appearance of a stamped braiding pattern.  As the white people put an exorbitant price on the flour and trinkets  they give in exchange for the Indians' work, the latter ask, when selling  for money, what seems more than its full value; but many who travel that  way, provided with cheap trinkets and gaudy ribbons, get the work cheaply  enough.    There is quite a large Roman Catholic church in the village; but we had  to be content with a tiptoe peep through its windows, as after the  \"angelus\" the door is locked. There are some small trading stores, a few  scattered houses, long, pretty winding roads up the hills, skirted by  cozy little farmhouses and wheat-fields, and one or two dwellings of more  pretension occupied as summer residences by Americans. A little higher  up, on the other side of the canal, lie the low white buildings of the  American fort. That fortification, with its sentries and the national  flag floating over the chief bastion, looked gay enough in the rays of  the fast-setting sun. After remaining several hours to coal, we left the  little village in the darkness, and when day dawned again found ourselves  out in the broad waters of Lake Superior--called by the Indians \"the  Great Sea\" (_Kichee Kumma_). For hours no land was to be seen on  either side, but we were visited by two little birds, quivering with  cold, weary from their long flight, almost too timid to alight upon our  boat, yet too tired to resist the resting-place. Poor little wanderers!  many a lonely emigrant, who had left all he loved behind to try his  fortune in an unknown land, felt sympathy for them.    Seeing nothing but water and sky to interest us without, we turned our  attention to our fellow-passengers within. At one end of the long saloon  a zealous Cecilite, the centre of a mixed group, was \"improving the  occasion,\" Bible in hand--exhorting his hearers to turn from the error of  their ways, and denouncing the world and its wickedness, as exemplified  in the group of card-players close by. Their \"I'll order it up!\" \"Pass!\"  \"I'll play it alone!\" mingled with the grave accents of the preacher,  whose exhortations were answered by shouts of laughter and ringing glees  from the other end of the boat, where stood the piano and its satellites.  In vain the poor Cecilite tried \"to stem the torrent\" of what he  considered \"Satan's doings;\" his obstinacy and want of tact only  increased the mischievous delight of his enemies. At the sides of the  saloon small knots of French Canadians chattered merrily; at the top of  the stairs an emigrant or two were allowed to infringe the rule of \"no  deck passengers,\" because of the crowd on board. Poor things! One did not  wonder that they escaped gladly from the jarring sounds and offensive  smells below.    Early on Saturday morning we passed Silver Islet, that mine of wealth to  our neighbours across the line. It lies in an island-dotted bay, and is  so covered with mining works that it looks like a pile of buildings  rising out of the water. The crushing-mills are on the mainland close by.  Silver Islet first belonged to a Canadian company; but from lack of  enterprise or capital it was sold to an American company for a nominal  sum, and, as is often the case, the sanguine nature of Cousin Jonathan,  acting on the motto, \"Nothing venture nothing win,\" has been successful,  and the company is now (1879) shipping $20,000 worth of silver ore a day.  The islet can be visited only by those who have especial permission to  see the mines and works, or friends among the officials, neither of which  had we.    The adjacent village, at which the _Manitoba_ stopped, did not look  as if times were very prosperous with it. Two smoky little tugs lay idly  at the small wharf, and the few red wooden houses built against the  rocks, their flat roofs piled up with bales of goods and boxes--the  ever-present blue barrels of coal-oil being most conspicuous--seemed  tenantless. Leaving Silver Islet far behind, we rounded Whitefish Point,  with its tall lighthouse, and saw a very distinct mirage--a long stretch  of cold blue water, filled with great blocks of ice. It was rather  amusing to see the eagerness with which glasses were levelled at the  \"counterfeit presentment\" of a scene, of whose reality we should soon  have even too much.    At the entrance of Thunder Bay, we passed Thunder Cape on our right and  Pie Island on our left; the former a bold promontory, rising 1300 feet  above the sea-level, and wooded with a short stunted growth of bush,  principally poplar. Save for its picturesquely situated lighthouse and  log hut, where the keeper lives, no other sign of habitation was visible.  Thunder Bay and Cape probably take their names from the fierce and  frequent storms that rage there; Pie Island from the peculiar formation  of its northern end. Passing many rocky islands, with tiny waterfalls  zigzaging down their sides, we arrived at \"Prince Arthur's Landing\" and  walked up the long pier, partly roofed to form a temporary warehouse for  a pile of freight, in the teeth of a blistering hot land-breeze, which  drove the dust in blinding, choking eddies about us. After looking at  some specimens of Lake Superior agate which were on exhibition in a dusty  shop, and buying some lemons at what we thought the exorbitant price of a  dollar and a half per dozen, we were glad to retrace our steps to the  steamer, where we found the captain ready and anxious to start. Half an  hour's steaming brought us to the mouth of the Kaministiquai, or Dog  River, and entering it, we were at once in another country. No more dusty  roads, baked-looking piers, nor begrimed aborigines; but bright, rippling  water, cool green fields, dotted here and there with leafy trees, cattle  grazing or lying lazily in their shade, trim fences, long grass-grown  country roads, and soon the white walls and flowery garden of Fort  William, the Hudson Bay Company's trading post. The rockery in the centre  of the garden would have gladdened the heart of an Ontario gardener. I  believe that wealthy people there have had large fragments of Lake  Superior rock brought down to adorn their lawns and gardens. We found  friends at the fort in the factor and his family, with whom we spent a  pleasant half-hour. Mr. McIntyre is well known, and many will owe him  gratitude for kindness as long as Fort William or the Canada Pacific  Railway remains in their memory.    We left Thunder Bay for Duluth at three o'clock. The day had become  cloudy, and showers fell all the evening, but not heavily enough to  prevent every man, woman, and child from rushing out to \"speak\" the  down-coming boat _Ontario_, and hear her report on the state of the  ice-fields. She had been six days icebound at Duluth and the answer to  our captain's inquiry was--    \"Forty miles of ice; only one passage. If you hit that, all"]]]
