The passers-by, pursued, as it  were, by the fleet steps of pneumonia, scarcely dared stop. Juan's  voice at last died in his throat; he could sing no more. His legs  trembled under him; his hands lost their sense of touch. He took a  few steps, then sank on the sidewalk at the foot of the grating that  surrounds the square. He sat with his elbows on his knees and buried  his head in his hands. He felt vaguely that it was the last moment of  his life, and he again prayed, imploring the divine pity.    At the end of a few minutes he was conscious of being shaken by the  arm, and knew that a man was standing before him. He raised his head,  and taking for granted it was the old story about moving on, inquired  timidly,--    \"Are you an officer?\"    \"No; I am no officer. What is the matter with you? Get up.\"    \"I don't believe I can, sir.\"    \"Are you very cold?\"    \"Yes, sir; but it isn't exactly that,--I haven't had anything to eat  to-day.\"    \"I will help you, then. Come; up with you.\"    The man took Juan by both arms and stood him on his feet. He seemed  very strong.    \"Now lean on me, and let us see if we can find a cab.\"    \"But where are you going to take me?\"    \"Nowhere where you wouldn't want to go. Are you afraid?\"    \"No; I feel in my heart that you will help me.\"    \"Come along, then. Let's see how soon I can get you something hot to  drink.\"    \"God will reward you for this, sir; the Virgin will reward you. I  thought I was going to die there, against that grating.\"    \"Don't talk about dying, man. The question now is to find a cab;  if we can only move along fast enough--What is the matter? Are you  stumbling?\"    \"Yes, sir. I think I struck a lamp-post. You see--as I am blind--\"    \"Are you blind?\" asked the stranger, anxiously.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Since when?\"    \"I was born blind.\"    Juan felt his companion's arm tremble in his, and they walked along  in silence. Suddenly the man stopped and asked in a voice husky with  emotion,--    \"What is your name?\"    \"Juan.\"    \"Juan what?\"    \"Juan Martínez.\"    \"And your father was Manuel Martínez, wasn't he,--musician of the  third artillery band?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    The blind one felt the tight clasp of two powerful arms that almost  smothered him, and heard a trembling voice exclaim,--    \"My God, how horrible, and how happy! I am a criminal, Juan! I am  your brother Santiago!\"    And the two brothers stood sobbing together in the middle of the  street. The snow fell on them lightly. Suddenly Santiago tore himself  from his brother's embrace, and began to shout, intermingling his  words with interjections,--    \"A cab! A cab! Isn't there a cab anywhere around? Curse my luck!  Come, Juanillo, try; make an effort, my boy; we are not so very far.  But where in the name of sense are all the cabs? Not one has passed  us. Ah, I see one coming, thank God! No; the brute is going in the  other direction. Here is another. This one is mine. Hello there,  driver! Five dollars if you take us flying to Number 13 Castellana.\"    And taking his brother in his arms as though he had been a mere  child, he put him in the cab and jumped in after him. The driver  whipped his horse, and off they went, gliding swiftly and noiselessly  over the snow. In the mean time Santiago, with his arms still around  Juan, told him something of his life. He had been in Costa Rica,  not Cuba, and had accumulated a respectable fortune. He had spent  many years in the country, beyond mail service and far from any  point of communication with Europe. He had written several letters  to his father, and had managed to get these on some steamer trading  with England, but had never received any answer. In the hope of  returning shortly to Spain, he had made no inquiries. He had been  in Madrid for four months. He learned from the parish record that  his father was dead; but all he could discover concerning Juan was  vague and contradictory. Some believed that he had died, while others  said that, reduced to the last stages of misery, he went through  the streets singing and playing on the guitar. All his efforts  to find him had been fruitless; but fortunately Providence had  thrown him into his arms. Santiago laughed and cried alternately,  showing himself to be the same frank, open-hearted, jovial soul  that Juan had loved so in his childhood. The cab finally came to  a stop. A man-servant opened the door, and Juan was fairly lifted  into the house. When the door closed behind him, he breathed a warm  atmosphere full of that peculiar aroma of comfort which wealth seems  to exhale. His feet sank in the soft carpet. Two servants relieved  him of his dripping clothes and brought him clean linen and a warm  dressing-gown. In the same room, before a crackling wood fire, he was  served a comforting bowl of hot broth, followed by something more  substantial, which he was made to take very slowly and with all the  precautions which his critical condition required. Then a bottle of  old wine was brought up from the cellar. Santiago was too restless  to sit still. He came and went, giving orders, interrupting himself  every minute to say,--    \"How do you feel now, Juan? Are you warm enough? Perhaps you don't  care for this wine.\"    When the meal was over, the two brothers sat silently side by side  before the fire. Santiago then inquired of one of the servants if the  Señora and the children had already retired. On learning that they  had, he said to Juan, beaming with delight,--    \"Can you play on the piano?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Come into the parlor, then. Let us give them a surprise.\"    He accordingly led him into an adjoining room and seated him  at the piano. He raised the top so as to obtain the greatest  possible vibration, threw open the doors, and went through all the  manoeuvres peculiar to a surprise,--tiptoeing, whispering, speaking  in a falsetto, and so much absurd pantomime that Juan could not help  laughing as he realized how little his brother had changed.    \"Now, Juanillo, play something startling, and play it loud, with all  your might.\"    The blind boy struck up a military march. A quiver ran through the  silent house like that which stirs a music-box while it is being  wound up. The notes poured from the piano, hurrying, jostling one  another, but never losing their triumphant rhythm. Every now and  then Santiago exclaimed,--    \"Louder, Juanillo! Louder!\"    And the blind boy struck the notes with all his spirit and might.    \"I see my wife peeping in from behind the curtains. Go on, Juanillo.  She is in her night-gown,--he, he! I am pretending not to see her. I  have no doubt she thinks I am crazy,--he, he! Go on, Juanillo.\"    Juan obeyed, although he thought the jest had been carried far  enough. He wanted to know his sister-in-law and kiss his nephews.    \"Now I can just see Manolita. Hello! Paquito is up too. Didn't I tell  you we should surprise them? But I am afraid they will take cold.  Stop a minute, Juanito!\"    And the infernal clamor was silenced.    \"Come, Adela, Manolita, and Paquito, get on your things and come in  to see your uncle Juan. This is Juanillo, of whom you have heard me  speak so often. I have just found him in the street almost frozen to  death. Come, hurry and dress, all of you.\"    The whole family was soon ready, and rushed in to embrace the blind  boy. The wife's voice was soft and harmonious. To Juan it sounded  like the voice of the Virgin. He discovered, too, that she was  weeping silently at the thought of all his sufferings. She ordered a  foot-warmer to be brought in. She wrapped his legs in a cloak and put  a soft cushion behind his head. The children stood around his chair,  caressing him, and all listened with tears to the accounts of his  past misery. Santiago struck his forehead; the children stroked his  hands, saying,--    \"You will never be hungry again, will you, uncle? Or go out without  a cloak and an umbrella? I don't want you to, neither does Manolita,  nor mamma, nor papa.\"    \"I wager you will not give him your bed, Paquito,\" said Santiago,  trying to conceal his tears under his affected merriment.    \"My bed won't fit him, papa! But he can have the bed in the guests'  chamber. It is a great bed, uncle, a big, big bed!\"    \"I don't believe I care to go to bed,\" said Juan. \"Not just now at  any rate, I am so comfortable here.\"    \"That pain has gone, hasn't it, uncle?\" whispered Manolita, kissing  and stroking his hand.    \"Yes, dear, yes,--God bless you! Nothing pains me now. I am happy,  very happy! Only I feel sleepy, so sleepy that I can hardly raise my  eyelids.\"    \"Never mind us; sleep if you feel like it,\" said Santiago.    \"Yes, uncle, sleep,\" repeated the children.           *       *       *       *       *    And Juan fell asleep,--but he wakened in another world.    The next morning, at dawn, two policemen stumbled against a corpse in  the snow. The doctor of the charity hospital pronounced it a case of  congealing of the blood.    As one of the officers turned him over, face upward,--    \"Look, Jiménez,\" said he; \"he seems to be laughing.\"    [Illustration]          A CHRISTMAS IN THE FOREST.    From the French of ANDRÉ THEURIET.      Christmas Eve that year was bleak and cold, and the village seemed  benumbed. The houses were closed hermetically, and so were the  stables, from which came the muffled sound of animals chewing the  cud. From time to time the clacking of wooden shoes on the hardened  ground resounded through the deserted streets, then a door was  hastily opened and closed, and all relapsed into silence. It was  evident from the thick smoke rising through the chimneys into the  gray air that every family was huddled around its hearth while the  housewife prepared the Christmas supper. Stooping forward, with their  legs stretched out to the fire, their countenances beaming with  pleasure at the prospect of the morrow's festival and the foretaste  of the fat "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47338"],[0,"Kate Vernon: A Tale. Vol. 1 (of 3) (#3)"],[1," and watch you.\" In  a few moments I was whirling my fair incognita round to the inspiring  strains of the Elfin Waltz, then new and unhacknied.    What a delicious waltz that was! My partner seemed endowed with the  very spirit of the dance: her light pliant form seemed to respond to  every tone of the music, and not an unpractised _valseur_ myself, I  felt that I was, at all events, no encumbrance to her movements. I have  never heard that waltz since--whether ground on the most deplorable of  barrel organs, or blown in uncertain blasts from the watery instruments  of a temperance band--without seeing, as in a magic mirror, the whole  scene conjured up before my eyes: the intense enjoyment of my partner,  which beamed so eloquently from her soft grey eyes, and spoke volumes  of the nature it expressed: the childlike simplicity with which, when  at length wearied, she stopped and said, turning to me--\"You dance  very well! How I have enjoyed that waltz!\"    Many a stray sixpence those reminiscences have cost me! \"But,\" she  continued, \"it must be late, and I cannot keep my friends any longer,  let us find them as soon as possible.\" This was soon done, and, to my  infinite chagrin, my partner declared herself quite ready to depart,  pronouncing a glowing eulogium on my dancing. \"You must have taken  lessons since I had the pleasure of meeting you, for formerly--\" There  she stopped, for the philanthropic little cavalier she had called _caro  maestro_ interrupted her, wrapped a shawl round her, begging she would  hold it to her mouth and keep that feature closed during her passage to  the carriage, and led the way with his, I supposed, wife, leaving me  still in possession of the little hand which had rested on my shoulder  during the waltz. Now, or never, I thought.    \"I fear I have induced you to prolong that waltz beyond your strength,\"  for I felt her arm still trembling with the exertion, \"you must allow  me to assure myself to-morrow that you have felt no ill effects?\"    \"We are not staying here,\" she said with some hesitation; \"we only came  in for the festival and leave to-morrow.\"    Here we reached the passage, and _il caro maestro_ proceeding to  discover their carriage, I felt myself, of course, bound to divide my  attentions with the lady of the cap, and, not choosing to prosecute my  enquiries within range of her ears, I remained some time in a state of  internal frying till he returned, and I was again _tête-à-tête_ for a  moment with their charge.    \"But do you not reside in the neighbourhood?\" We were close at the  door. Smiling with her eyes, she shook her head, pointed to the shawl  which she held to her mouth in obedience to the injunction she had  received, and remained silent; I was distracted. \"Forgive me,\" I  exclaimed, \"and pray speak; I must see you again.\"    \"Come, my dear,\" cried my tormentor, \"you'll catch cold, make haste!\"    Her foot was on the step;--she was in, her guardian opposite her;--the  glass drawn up. \"Move on,\" said the policeman. One glance, as she bowed  full of arch drollery, and I was left on the door step repeating, over  and over, \"No. 756--756,\" while my brain was in a whirl of excitement,  my beautiful vision gone, and my only clue to discover her the number  of a cab!          CHAPTER II.    THE SEARCH.      With a confused sensation of annoyance and ill temper, I opened my eyes  at the _reveillé_ next morning, and for some moments experienced that  most painful puzzle of which few in this troublesome world of ours  are quite ignorant, and which is one of the accompaniments of a great  grief, videlicet, a perfect certainty that you are in the middle of  something disagreeable, but what you are not sufficiently wide awake to  discover. The process of shaving, at all times a reflective one, soon  cleared up to me the mystery, and placed in full array the pros. and  cons. of my chance of ever meeting my beautiful \"incognita\" again. Even  my decidedly sanguine disposition was compelled to acknowledge that the  \"pros.\" were few indeed. Still, as I am not without a certain degree  of resolution, especially when the matter to be decided on touches my  fancy or my affections, I determined pretty firmly not to relinquish  the effort to discover and renew my acquaintance with the belle of last  night.    I had hardly commenced an attack upon my eggs and broiled ham, when  Burton walked in, brimful of curiosity, as I had anticipated, and to  avoid the bore of being questioned, I at once opened my budget, and  told him the whole history down to my present resolution; the more  readily as he was a sufficiently high-minded gentleman-like fellow to  talk to about a woman you respected; no blab, and a great chum of mine  into the bargain.    I regret to say he laughed most unsympathisingly at my dilemma, and  acknowledged that he had spent the greater part of the evening watching  my proceedings, and speculating as to alternate expressions of triumph  and defeat which swept across my countenance.    \"I never heard of a more curious _rencontre_, the fair unknown must  have had a very slight acquaintance with your prototype; and then your  unequalled luck sending you to the right quarter for discovering the  scene of the original acquaintance, and being sufficiently _au fait_  at its habits and inhabitants, she could never have dreamt of having  mistaken you. But how do you think of setting about her recovery?\"    \"Ah! there's the rub. An advertisement in the _Carrington  Chronicle_--'If the young lady with the antique fan, &c., who danced  the Elfin Waltz with an officer of H.M.'s -- Light Dragoons, at the ball  last night, will send her address to the Cavalry Barracks, she will  hear of something to her advantage,' would hardly do, eh? Besides, the  admiration, however respectful, of a younger son, a landless Captain  would not, I fear, come under the denomination of an advantage.\"    \"And suppose you discover her, perhaps enshrined in some lordly old  manor house, surrounded with all the prestige of position, what will  you say for yourself as an excuse, for your bold attempt to see her  again?\"    \"If I met her in one of her native mud cabins the difficulty, if it  existed at all, would exist all the same for me; I feel that she is in  herself equal to a ring fence of nobility. But,\" I continued, walking  up and down the room with folded arms, the approved method of showing  that stern determination, \"_that_ I can easily manage; I suffered too  much, and felt my natural powers whatever they are, under too great a  cloud from my false position last night, ever to submit myself to the  same again. No, I shall boldly say that I had called to relieve my  conscience by apologising for the audacity with which I had encouraged  her mistake last night, but that I really had not sufficient strength  of mind to deny myself the pleasure of dancing and conversing with  her, and that in reward of my present endeavour to do right, I hoped  she would not deny me the honour of her acquaintance; surely, the very  effort to see her will be in my favour.\"    \"Granted; _et puis_,\" said Burton coolly.    \"For God's sake, my dear fellow, don't ask me to begin thinking of  consequences _now_, for the first time in my life!\"    \"It strikes me, Egerton, that you are decidedly done for!\"    \"Not exactly. Yet I confess I would attempt and brave a good deal to  hear the low tones of my nameless belle's rather remarkable voice once  more. There was so much feeling in them. I am sure she sings. I fear  the wish to see her is scarcely reciprocated, for I had at times a  dread sensation from the bright laugh in her eye that somehow or other  she was selling me. Probably she confounded me with some fool she had  known formerly; flattering association! Yet, I am not without what are  generally considered elements of success in the eyes of the fair sex!  _Imprimis_, one dark brown curly _pow_, as our friends in the north  say, two eyes ditto in tint, six feet high, and an air _distingué_. Eh!  Burton, what do you say?\"    \"That you're an insufferable coxcomb, but the inventory is tolerably  correct.\"    \"Don't imagine that I consider the items of much value. None but  inexperienced boys think that mere good looks are a passport to the  heart of any woman that's worth having. We love beauty exclusively; but  there is not a woman with an ounce of truth in herself that will not be  instinctively attracted to a manly straightforward fellow, be he ever  so plain; and, if he show her devotion, give him her whole heart as  readily as if he was Apollo and Adonis all in one!\"    \"Hum,\" said Burton, \"perhaps so; but to business. How do you intend to  proceed?\"    \"First, to discover cab 756, and, from its interesting charioteer,  learn at what hotel the objects of my search put up; there they will  know their names.\"    \"Suppose they were at a private house with friends.\"    \"Pshaw! Suppose they had lodgings in the moon! Did I not tell you the  young lady expressly said they were perfect strangers?\"    \"That might be _façon_.\"    \"Burton! Another objection and you may look out for squalls! It is my  only plan, so be silent.\"    \"When do you set out upon the search?\"    \"This morning, while the memory of Jehu may be fresh; the moment parade  is over.\"    \"Shall we hunt in couples?\"    \"No, my dear fellow; in such a pursuit you would founder at the first  fence.\"    \"I confess my heart and soul are not in the business, so I might be an  obstacle; besides--but there's the trumpet; adieu! May success attend  you, and the spirit of a thousand detectives inspire you.\"    Parade over, I hastened to doff my uniform, and with a delightful  sensation of excitement, which I never imagined I could experience in  the depressed atmosphere of Carrington, I sallied forth on my quest,  with a spirit of perseverance, which, if there be any truth in ancient  proverbs, augured well for the accomplishment of my object.
