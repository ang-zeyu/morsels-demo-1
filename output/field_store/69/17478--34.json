During the afternoon of the 19th a namesake of  his, Captain James Grant of the Brunswick, East Indiaman, hailed him and  informed him that he had orders to take the Lady Nelson in tow. The  commander of the brig did not at all relish this news, but dreading  further detention as he was in the track of the enemy, he took the  proffered hawser on board. The brig towed well as long as the sea was  smooth, and at first no discomfort was felt. Then a continued spell of  bad weather ensued, and a driving rain, which found its way under the  covering boards and along the gunwale of the ship, caused great  unpleasantness. Worse was to follow, for it began to blow very hard, and  the Brunswick set off at high speed, dragging the little brig mercilessly  through the heavy seas which almost enveloped her. The sight evoked much  amusement among the passengers on board the big Indiaman, who frequently  visited the stern galley to watch the waves wash completely over the Lady  Nelson.    On the 23rd of March an unusually heavy sea strained the brig to such a  degree that Grant ordered the hawser to be let go, and bade the Brunswick  farewell. It was imagined by those on board the larger vessel that the  Lady Nelson, deeming it impossible to proceed, had turned back to  Portsmouth. Grant, however, had determined to continue his voyage alone.    He lost sight of the fleet during the night, and next day, in latitude 43  degrees 55 minutes north and longitude 14 degrees 17 minutes west, the  weather being fine and clear, he ordered the saturated bedding to be  brought up from below and placed on deck to dry. This practice was  continued throughout the voyage, and to it, and to the care taken to  prevent the men sleeping in wet clothes, Grant attributed the healthy  state of the crew on reaching Sydney. When the sea moderated it was also  possible to stop the leaks on deck.    On the 25th a strange sail was sighted, and from the masthead a large  fleet was soon afterwards made out bearing north-north-east. One ship  detached itself from the rest and gave chase to the Lady Nelson, gaining  fast upon her. She was perceived to be an English frigate. At 6 P.M. she  fired a shot which compelled Lieutenant Grant to shorten sail and to show  his colours. As a second shot was fired it was clear that the frigate  still mistook him for one of the enemy, so he wore and stood towards her,  when she proved to be H.M.S. Hussar, acting as convoy to the West India  Fleet. Her commander informed Grant that he had mistaken the Lady Nelson  for a Spaniard, and expressed his regret for having given so much  trouble, and after the usual compliments they parted. Grant adds that he  did not learn the name of the courteous commander,* (* It was Viscount  Garlies.) but again at daylight the Lady Nelson came on part of his  convoy, which, not knowing who she was, crowded sail to get out of her  way, \"with,\" says Grant, \"one exception, this being the ----, which, much  to his credit, hove to and fired a shot almost plump on board of us.  Another vessel, the Hope of Liverpool, I could hardly keep clear of, for  the more I attempted to avoid him the more he attempted to get near me,  so much so that we were near running on board each other.\" The Hope's  captain asked Grant very peremptorily who he was and where he came from,  to which Grant replied by hoisting his colours and pendant; but even this  did not satisfy the irate merchant skipper, who appeared to have had very  decided intentions of running down the Lady Nelson. Eventually, however,  he rejoined the convoy, which stood to the westward under close-reefed  top-sails.    On the 1st of April the Lady Nelson fell in with another heavy gale which  raged till the 3rd, and finding that his ship was drifting south of  Madeira, Grant shaped a course for Las Palmas.    On the 8th he crossed the Tropic of Cancer.    On Sunday the 13th he came to an anchor in Port Praya, St. Iago, where  the Governor received him with much politeness and gave him permission to  replenish his ship. While in this port Grant discovered that the second  mate had sown seeds of discontent among his crew, so he promptly handed  him over to the Governor to be sent back to England. Two boys, however,  deserted and ran off with a boat. Several parties were sent out in search  of them by the Governor, and the two deserters were eventually caught and  brought home by the natives--both riding on one ass. The sight of the  bluejackets in such a predicament vastly amused the Portuguese seamen in  port, who ridiculed them to such an extent that Grant did not think it  necessary to punish them further. Grant describes the natives of Port  Praya as resembling negroes, and remarks that the females seemed to spend  their time in spinning cotton from a distaff with a spindle. The ship's  keels were examined here and one found to be broken, but the repairs,  owing to the assistance given by the Governor, were finished in two days.    Having taken in a sufficient supply of water, the Lady Nelson left St.  Iago on April 27th. The Governor, who seems to have been most polite and  obliging to everybody, permitted two Portuguese sailors to be entered on  her muster-roll, which brought her crew up to twelve. Soon after leaving  port, one of the seamen became ill, and as his temperature rose very high  the commander gave orders for him to be immediately isolated, though he  was fortunately cured in four days. The food served to the men then  underwent some alteration. It was thought that oatmeal was too heating in  the humid weather of the tropics, and tea was substituted for it at  breakfast, wine supplemented with spruce beer being issued instead of  spirits. Not one man fell sick afterwards.    As the ship neared the Equator various cross-currents were frequently met  with, and \"heavy squalls with rain\" and a very disagreeable sea arose,  the result of a sudden change of wind from north-north-east to south-west  and south-south-west. The Lady Nelson pitched and rolled considerably,  and nearly every one on board was sea-sick. On the 6th it fell calm  again.    At 6 A.M. on the 9th a schooner was sighted, and shortly afterward a  brig, which stood towards the ship. Believing that the latter was an  enemy, Grant was glad when a storm hid her from view. On the 10th,  however, a glimpse of the brig was again caught, and on the 13th two more  sail were descried standing to the westward, but they finally  disappeared. The Lady Nelson was now surrounded by flying-fish and  tropical birds in great numbers, the latter being of the species  mentioned by Captain Cook as seen by him when he traversed this route.    On May 16th a long, heavy swell was experienced with light airs, and the  sea took a luminous appearance. A spell of bad weather followed, ending  on the 23rd, when, the day being fine, the boats were lowered and the  keels overhauled and repaired, and it was then found that a new piece of  wood which had been put on the after keel at Port Praya was missing. Not  having sufficient timber on board to repair it as before, the keel was  let farther down in the well and a breadth of planking was joined to it  with iron hooping and nails, with the result that it extended three feet  below the vessel.    On the 28th, when nearing Rio de Janeiro, an inspection was made of the  bread and water, and as the latter was found to be in good condition  Grant decided not to enter the port. Some of the bread was a little  damaged by leakage into the bread room, but a more water-tight place for  storing it was soon found. About the same date birds were again observed,  particularly the hoglet: the men caught many of these and made caps of  their skins. Mother Cary's chickens* (* Procellaria pelagica Linn.) were  also met with in great numbers. Gales and calms now alternated until June  11th, when there were frequent squalls, the wind finally blowing with  such violence that at 3 P.M. it was thought advisable to heave to. Later  the storm abated, and the vessel was able to make good progress until the  18th. A curious sea followed the ship on this day, the waves rising  perpendicularly, so that the commander conjectured that there was ground  at no great depth. He put the deep-sea lead over, but no soundings could  be obtained.    On the 23rd at 3 P.M. a vessel was seen bearing down before the wind  towards the Lady Nelson. The stranger proved to be a Spanish brig  carrying prize colours. She had been captured in the River Plate by a  privateer which had been fitted out by a merchant at the Cape of Good  Hope, and was commanded by Mr. John Black. She was then on her way to the  Cape of Good Hope. On coming within hail her master informed the Lady  Nelson's commander that he had neither book nor chart on board, and  wished to know where he was; he also begged some twine and canvas to  repair his sails. The prize was of about 70 tons burthen and was loaded  with beeswax, hides, tallow, and tobacco. She was without a boat, as it  had been washed overboard, so Lieutenant Grant shortened sail and desired  her captain to keep near him and gave him the latitude and longitude. On  the following day the Lady Nelson lowered a boat and brought the prize  master on board, to whom Lieutenant Grant gave a chart of the Cape and  several other necessaries. He asked Mr. Black why he had so boldly  approached the Lady Nelson, since his ship was painted like a Spaniard,  and so might well have been taken for one. Black's answer was that he  knew from her canvas that the Lady Nelson was not an enemy. When he was  shown over her he expressed his astonishment at her centre-boards, and  her construction was therefore explained to him. But evidently he was not  favourably impressed, for when he was being escorted back to his ship he  asked one of her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7514"],[0,"A Guide to Stoicism (#3)"],[1,"oul. He figured to himself the soul as receiving a  modification from every external object which acts upon it just as  the air receives countless strokes when many people are speaking at  once. Further, he declared that in receiving an impression the soul  was purely passive and that the phantasy revealed not only its own  existence, but that also of its cause, just as light displays itself  and the things that are in it. Thus, when through sight we receive an  impression of white, an affection takes place in the soul, in virtue  whereof we are able to say that there exists a white object affecting  us. The power to name the object resides in the understanding. First  must come the phantasy, and the understanding, having the power of  utterance, expresses in speech the affection it receives from the  object. The cause of the phantasy was called the \"phantast,\" _e.  g._ the white or cold object. If there is no external cause, then  the supposed object of the impression was a \"phantasm,\" such as a  figure in a dream, or the Furies whom Orestes sees in his frenzy.    How then was the impression which had reality behind it to be  distinguished from that which had not? \"By the feel\" is all that the  Stoics really had to say in answer to this question. Just as Hume  made the difference between sense-impressions and ideas to lie in the  greater vividness of the former, so did they; only Hume saw no  necessity to go beyond the impression, whereas the Stoics did.  Certain impressions, they maintained, carried with them an  irresistible conviction of their own reality, and this, not merely in  the sense that they existed; but also that they were referable to an  external cause. These were called \"gripping phantasies.\" Such a  phantasy did not need proof of its own existence, or of that of its  object. It possessed self-evidence. Its occurrence was attended with  yielding and assent on the part of the soul. For it is as natural for  the soul to assent to the self-evident as it is for it to pursue its  proper good. The assent to a griping phantasy was called  \"comprehension,\" as indicating the firm hold that the soul thus took  of reality. A gripping phantasy was defined as one which was stamped  and impressed from an existing object, in virtue of that object  itself, in such a way as it could not be from a non-existent object.  The clause \"in virtue of that object itself\" was put into the  definition to provide against such a case as that of the mad Orestes,  who takes his sister to be a Fury. There the impression was derived  from an existing object, but not from that object as such, but as  coloured by the imagination of the percipient.    The criterion of truth then was no other than the gripping phantasy.  Such at least was the doctrine of the earlier Stoics, but the later  added a saving clause, \"when there is no impediment.\" For they were  pressed by their opponents with such imaginary cases as that of  Admetus, seeing his wife before him in very deed, and yet not  believing it to be her. But here there was an impediment. Admetus did  not believe that the dead could rise. Again Menelaus did not believe  in the real Helen when he found her on the island of Pharos. But here  again there was an impediment. For Menelaus could not have been  expected to know that he had been for ten years fighting for a  phantom. When, however, there was no such impediment, then they said  the gripping phantasy did indeed deserve its name, for it almost took  men by the hair of the head and dragged them to assent.    So far we have used \"phantasy\" only of real or imaginary impressions  of sense. But the term was not thus restricted by the Stoics, who  divided phantasies into sensible and not sensible. The latter came  through the understanding and were of bodiless things which could  only be grasped by reason. The ideas of Plato they declared existed  only in our minds. Horse, man, and animal had no substantial  existence but were phantasms of the soul. The Stoics were thus what  we should call Conceptualists.    Comprehension too was used in a wider sense than that in which we  have so far employed it. There was comprehension by the senses as of  white and black, of rough and smooth, but there was also  comprehension by the reason of demonstrative conclusions such as that  the gods exist and that they exercise providence. Here we are  reminded of Locke's declaration: \"'Tis as certain there's a God as  that the opposite angles made by the intersection of two straight  lines are equal.\" The Stoics indeed had great affinities with that  thinker or rather he with them. The Stoic account of the manner in  which the mind arrives at its ideas might almost be taken from the  first book of Locke's _Essay_. As many as nine ways are  enumerated of which the first corresponds to simple ideas--    (1) by presentation, as objects of sense    (2) by likeness, as the idea of Socrates from his picture    (3) by analogy, that is, by increase or decrease, as ideas of giants  and pigmies from men, or as the notion of the centre of the earth,  which is reached by the consideration of smaller spheres.    (4) by transposition, as the idea of men with eyes in their breasts.    (5) by composition, as the idea of a Centaur.    (6) by opposition, as the idea of death from that of life.    (7) by a kind of transition, as the meaning of words and the idea of  place.    (8)by nature, as the notion of the just and the good    (9)by privation, as handless    The Stoics resembled Locke again in endeavoring to give such a  definition of knowledge as should cover at once the reports of the  senses and the relation between ideas. Knowledge was defined by them  as a sure comprehension or a habit in the acceptance of phantasies  which was not liable to be changed by reason. On a first hearing  these definitions might seem limited to sense knowledge but if we  bethink ourselves of the wider meanings of comprehension and of  phantasy, we see that the definitions apply as they were meant to  apply to the mind's grasp upon the force of a demonstration no less  than upon the existence of a physical object.    Zeno, with that touch of oriental symbolism which characterized him,  used to illustrate to his disciples the steps to knowledge by means  of gestures. Displaying his right hand with the fingers outstretched  he would say, \"That is a phantasy,\" then contracting the fingers a  little, \"That is assent,\" then having closed the fist, \"That is  comprehension,\" then clasping the fist closely with the left hand, he  would add, \"That is knowledge.\"    A notion which corresponds to our word concept was defined as a  phantasm of the understanding of a rational animal. For a notion was  but a phantasm as it presented itself to a rational mind. In the same  way so many shillings and sovereigns are in themselves but shillings  and sovereigns, but when used as passage money they become fare.  Notions were arrived at partly by nature, partly by teaching and  study. The former kind of notions were called preconceptions; the  latter went merely by the generic name.    Out of the general ideas which nature imparts to us, reason was  perfected about the age of fourteen, at the time when the voice--its  outward and visible sign--attains its full development, and when the  human animal is complete in other respects as being able to reproduce  its kind. Thus reason which united us to the gods was not, according  to the Stoics, a pre-existent principal, but a gradual development  out of sense. It might truly be said that with them the senses were  the intellect.    Being was confined by the Stoics to body, a bold assertion of which  we shall meet the consequences later. At present it is sufficient to  notice what havoc it makes among the categories. Of Aristotle's ten  categories it leaves only the first, Substance, and that only in its  narrowest sense of Primary Substance. But a substance or body might  be regarded in four ways--      (1) simply as a body    (2) as a body of a particular kind    (3) as a body in a particular state    (4) as a body in a particular relation.    Hence result the four Stoic categories of--        substrates      suchlike      so disposed      so related    But the bodiless would not be thus conjured out of existence. For  what was to be made of such things as the meaning of words, time,  place, and the infinite void? Even the Stoics did not assign body to  these, and yet they had to be recognized and spoken of. The  difficulty was got over by the invention of the higher category of  somewhat, which should include both body and the bodiless. Time was a  somewhat, and so was space, though neither of them possessed being.    In the Stoic treatment of the proposition, grammar was very much  mixed up with logic. They had a wide name which applied to any part  of diction, whether a word or words, a sentence, or even a syllogism.  This we shall render by \"dict.\" A dict, then, was defined as \"that  which subsists in correspondence with a rational phantasy.\" A dict  was one of the things which the Stoics admitted to be devoid of body.  There were three things involved when anything was said--the sound,  the sense, and the external object. Of these the first and the last  were bodies, but the intermediate one was not a body. This we may  illustrate after Seneca, as follows: \"You see Cato walking. What your  eyes see and your mind attends to is a body in motion. Then you say,  'Cato is walking'.\" The mere sound indeed of these words is air in  motion and therefore a body but the meaning of them is not a body but  an enouncement about a body, which is quite a different thing.    On examining such details as are left us of the Stoic logic, the  first thing which strikes one is its extreme complexity as compared  with the Aristotelian. It was a scholastic age, and the Stoics  refined and distinguished to their hearts' content. As regards  immediate inference, a subject which "]]]
