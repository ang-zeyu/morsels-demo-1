Petronius lies behind Tristram  Shandy, his influence can be detected in Smollett, and even Fielding paid  tribute to him.        IV    FORGERIES OF PETRONIUS.    From the very nature of the writings of such an author as Petronius, it  is evident that the gaps in the text would have a marked tendency to  stimulate the curiosity of literary forgers and to tempt their sagacity,  literary or otherwise.  The recovery of the Trimalchionian episode, and  the subsequent pamphleteering would by no means eradicate this \"cacoethes  emendandi.\"    When, circa 1650, the library of the unfortunate Nicolas Cippico yielded  up the Trau fragment, the news of this discovery spread far and wide and  about twelve years later, Statileo, in response to the repeated requests  of the Venetian ambassador, Pietro Basadonna, made with his own hand a  copy of the MS., which he sent to Basadonna.  The ambassador, in turn,  permitted this MS. to be printed by one Frambotti, a printer endowed with  more industry than critical acumen, and the resultant textual conflation  had much to do with the pamphlet war which followed.  Had this Paduan  printer followed the explicit directions which he received, and printed  exactly what was given him much good paper might have been saved and a  very interesting chapter in the history of literary forgery would  probably never have been written.  The pamphlet war did not die out until  Bleau, in 1670-71, printed his exact reproduction of the Trau manuscript  and the corrections introduced by that licentiousness of emendation of  which we have spoken.    In October, 1690, Francois Nodot, a French soldier of fortune, a  commissary officer who combined belles lettres and philosophy with his  official duties, wrote to Charpentier, President of the Academy of  France, calling, his attention to a copy of a manuscript which he (Nodot)  possessed, and which came into his hands in the following manner: one  Du Pin, a French officer detailed to service with Austria, had been  present at the sack of Belgrade in 1688.  That this Du Pin had, while  there, made the acquaintance of a certain Greek renegade, having, as a  matter of fact, stayed in the house of this renegade.  The Greek's  father, a man of some learning, had by some means come into possession of  the MS., and Du Pin, in going through some of the books in the house, had  come across it.  He had experienced the utmost difficulty in deciphering  the letters, and finally, driven by curiosity, had retained a copyist and  had it copied out.  That this Du Pin had this copy in his house at  Frankfort, and that he had given Nodot to understand that if he (Nodot)  came to Frankfort, he would be permitted to see this copy.  Owing to the  exigencies of military service, Nodot had been unable to go in person to  Frankfort, and that he had therefore availed himself of the friendly  interest and services of a certain merchant of Frankfort, who had  volunteered to find an amanuensis, have a copy made, and send it to  Nodot.  This was done, and Nodot concludes his letter to Charpentier by  requesting the latter to lay the result before the Academy and ask for  their blessing and approval.  These Nodotian Supplements were accepted as  authentic by the Academics of Arles and Nimes, as well as by Charpentier.  In a short time, however, the voices of scholarly skeptics began to be  heard in the land, and accurate and unbiased criticism laid bare the  fraud.  The Latinity was attacked and exception taken to Silver Age  prose in which was found a French police regulation which required newly  arrived travellers to register their names in the book of a police  officer of an Italian village of the first century.  Although they are  still retained in the text by some editors, this is done to give some  measure of continuity to an otherwise interrupted narrative, but they can  only serve to distort the author and obscure whatever view of him the  reader might otherwise have reached.  They are generally printed between  brackets or in different type.    In 1768 another and far abler forger saw the light of day.  Jose  Marchena, a Spaniard of Jewish extraction, was destined for an  ecclesiastical career.  He received an excellent education which served  to fortify a natural bent toward languages and historical criticism.  In  his early youth he showed a marked preference for uncanonical pursuits  and heretical doctrines and before he had reached his thirtieth year  prudence counseled him to prevent the consequences of his heresy and  avoid the too pressing Inquisition by a timely flight into France.  He arrived there in time to throw himself into the fight for liberty,  and in 1800 we find him at Basle attached to the staff of General Moreau.  While there he is said to have amused himself and some of his cronies by  writing notes on what Davenport would have called \"Forbidden Subjects,\"  and, as a means of publishing his erotic lucubrations, he constructed  this fragment, which brings in those topics on which he had enlarged.  He translated the fragment into French, attached his notes, and issued  the book.  There is another story to the effect that he had been  reprimanded by Moreau for having written a loose song and that he  exculpated himself by assuring the general that it was but a new fragment  of Petronius which he had translated.  Two days later he had the fragment  ready to prove his contention.    This is the account given by his Spanish biographer.  In his preface,  dedicated to the Army of the Rhine, he states that he found the fragment  in a manuscript of the work of St. Gennadius on the Duties of Priests,  probably of the XI Century.  A close examination revealed the fact that  it was a palimpsest which, after treatment, permitted the restoration of  this fragment.  It is supposed to supply the gap in Chapter 26 after the  word \"verberabant.\"    Its obscenity outrivals that of the preceding text, and the grammar,  style, and curiosa felicitas Petroniana make it an almost perfect  imitation.  There is no internal evidence of forgery.  If the text is  closely scrutinized it will be seen that it is composed of words and  expressions taken from various parts of the Satyricon, \"and that in every  line it has exactly the Petronian turn of phrase.\"    \"Not only is the original edition unprocurable,\" to quote again from  Mr. Gaselee's invaluable bibliography, \"but the reprint at Soleure  (Brussels), 1865, consisted of only 120 copies, and is hard to find.  The most accessible place for English readers is in Bohn's translation,  in which, however, only the Latin text is given; and the notes were a  most important part of the original work.\"    These notes, humorously and perhaps sarcastically ascribed to Lallemand,  Sanctae Theologiae Doctor, \"are six in number (all on various forms of  vice); and show great knowledge, classical and sociological, of unsavory  subjects.  Now that the book is too rare to do us any harm, we may admit  that the pastiche was not only highly amusing, but showed a perverse  cleverness amounting almost to genius.\"    Marchena died at Madrid in great poverty in 1821.  A contemporary has  described him as being rather short and heavy set in figure, of great  frontal development, and vain beyond belief.  He considered himself  invincible where women were concerned.  He had a peculiar predilection  in the choice of animal pets and was an object of fear and curiosity  to the towns people.  His forgery might have been completely successful  had he not acknowledged it himself within two or three years after the  publication of his brochure.  The fragment will remain a permanent  tribute to the excellence of his scholarship, but it is his Ode to Christ  Crucified which has made him more generally known, and it is one of the  ironies of fate that caused this deformed giant of sarcasm to compose a  poem of such tender and touching piety.    Very little is known about Don Joe Antonio Gonzalez de Salas, whose  connecting passages, with the exception of one which is irrelevant, are  here included.    The learned editors of the Spanish encyclopedia naively preface their  brief sketch with the following assertion: \"no tenemos noticias de su  vida.\"  De Salas was born in 1588 and died in 1654.  His edition of  Petronius was first issued in 1629 and re-issued in 1643 with a copper  plate of the Editor.  The Paris edition, from which he says he supplied  certain deficiencies in the text, is unknown to bibliographers and is  supposed to be fictitious.    To distinguish the spurious passages, as a point of interest, in the  present edition, the forgeries of Nodot are printed within round  brackets, the forgery of Marchena within square brackets, and the  additions of De Salas in italics {In this PG etext in curly brackets}.    The work is also accompanied by a translation of the six notes, the  composition of which led Marchena to forge the fragment which first  appeared in the year 1800.  These have never before been translated.    Thanks are due Ralph Straus, Esq., and Professor Stephen Gaselee.

His duties are the same as the host         at dinners.      INVITATIONS. These are usually given in brief         notes, but may be engraved, and are similar         to the regular invitations to dinners, and are         treated accordingly.      MEN. The men wear evening dress, and follow         the same etiquette as at other dinners.      WOMEN. The women wear evening dress, and         follow the same etiquette as at all dinners,         except that no calls are made by them afterward         upon the host.        BACHELOR'S FAREWELL DINNER. If the groom wishes,         he may give a farewell dinner a few evenings         before the wedding to his best man, ushers,         and a few intimate friends. He sits at the         head of the table and the best man opposite,         and on this occasion he may give scarf-pins,         link cuff-buttons--or neckties and gloves, if         he wishes--to the best man and ushers.        BACHELORS' LUNCHEONS. These are conducted like         BACHELOR'S DINNERS, which see. The one difference         is that, should the luncheon be given         before 6 P.M., afternoon dress should be worn.        BACHELORS' OPERA PARTIES. See THEATRE AND OPERA         PARTIES GIVEN BY MEN.        BACHELORS' SUPPERS. These are conducted the same         as BACHELOR'S DINNERS, which see.        BACHELORS' TEAS OR AFTERNOON RECEPTIONS.      CHAPERONES. If women are present, a married         chaperone is indispensable, who should be         the first person invited by personal call.           The chaperone at a small affair pours the         tea, and at a large one she receives with the         host, and each guest is presented to her.           The host conducts the chaperone to her         carriage, and also any other women who may         have assisted her.      DRESS. The hosts and guests wear afternoon         dress.      INVITATIONS. These maybe oral, brief notes, or,         for a large affair, engraved, and should be         sent from three days to a week in advance.      HOST. The host should greet his guests at the         door, shaking hands with each one, and introducing         to the chaperone those not known         to her.           He introduces guests who are strangers to         each other, bids them adieu, accompanies the         women to the door, and escorts the chaperone         to her carriage, and if she has come         alone without one, may very properly escort         her home.           If at a large reception several women have         helped him entertain, he should thank them         and see them to their carriages.           He will, of course, see that there is provided         a dressing-room for women with a maid to         wait upon them, and that the rooms are in         good order, well furnished with flowers, and         that the refreshments are attended to.           See also INVITATIONS.      MEN. Afternoon dress is worn.      WOMEN. The invitations, engraved or oral,         should be promptly acknowledged.           Women wear dress customary at afternoon         teas, and on their entrance should greet the         host. Upon departing they take leave of him,         though this is not necessary if the reception         be a large one.           If a young woman knows that a chaperone         is present, she need not have her own chaperone         accompany her.           If the chaperone leaves early, she should do         likewise.        BACHELORS' THEATRE PARTY. See THEATRE AND OPERA         PARTIES GIVEN BY MEN.        BADGES--BALLS (PUBLIC). It is customary for men         and women on the committees to wear on the         left side of the breast ornamental badges,         embroidered with the official position of the         wearer.        BAGGAGE. If a man is traveling with a woman, he         should see to the checking and care of her         baggage.           See also TRAVELING.      WEDDING TRIP. The best man should, some         time before the wedding, see that the baggage         of the bridal couple has been checked, and         the checks given to the groom.           See also BEST MAN.        BALLS. A ball is an evening function, beginning at         a late hour, devoted wholly to dancing. The         costumes are more elaborate, the supper arrangements         more extensive, and the floral         decorations more lavish than at a dance.      ACCEPTING INVITATION TO DANCE. While a         young woman may accept or decline any invitation         to dance, it is considered an act of discourtesy         to refuse one man for a dance and         to accept an invitation thereafter for the         same dance from another.      ANNOUNCING GUESTS. The hostess decides         whether or not the guests are to be announced.         At public balls it is customary.      ANSWERING INVITATIONS. These should be answered         immediately, and if declined, the         ticket should be returned.      ARRIVING AT. There is no set rule when guests         should arrive.           In the city, guests should arrive anywhere         between eleven and twelve, and in the country,         fifteen minutes after the hour set in the         invitation.      ASKING WOMEN TO DANCE. A man asks for         the privilege of a dance either with the         daughter of the hostess, with any guest of         the latter, or with any young woman receiving         with her.           On being introduced to a woman, he may         ask her for a dance, and should be punctual         in keeping the engagement.           It is her privilege to end the dance at any         moment she wishes, after which he should         conduct her to her chaperone or find a seat         for her, after which he is at liberty to go         elsewhere.           If for any cause a man has to break his         engagements to dance, he should personally         explain the matter to every woman with         whom he has an engagement and make a         suitable apology.        BALLS, ASSEMBLY. The etiquette at an assembly         ball is much the same as at a private ball,         the functions and duties of the hostess being         filled by a committee of women selected for         that purpose.           On entering the room, the guests bow to         the committee and pass on.           It is not necessary to take leave of the         committee.      CARRIAGE. A man should provide a carriage         in which to call for the woman he escorts         and her chaperone.      CHAPERONES. For a small ball given in a private         house, the hostess need not invite the mothers         of the young women, and the young women         can properly attend, knowing that the hostess         will act as a chaperone.           But at a large ball it is necessary to invite         the mother as well as the daughters, and         the chaperone as well as the debutante under         her care. The mother can send regrets for         herself, and send her daughters in care of a         maid. Or she can attend, and, after remaining         a suitable time, she may entrust her         daughter to the care of a chaperone who         intends to remain the whole evening.        BALLS FOR DEBUTANTE.      DRESS. A debutante should dress in white or         some extremely delicate color, and wear very         little jewelry--some simple brooch or single         piece of jewelry, or a slender chain of pearls.      DUTIES OF DAUGHTERS. Except at her own         debut, a daughter does not assist her mother         in receiving. She should be ready, however,         to see that young women have partners, and         to speak, without introduction, to strangers.      GUEST OF HONOR. If the ball is given in honor         of some special person, he should be met on         his arrival, introduced to the women of the         reception committee, escorted to the seat prepared         for him, and be looked after the entire         evening.           At the end of the ball he should be escorted         to his carriage.      DUTIES OF HOST. It is not necessary that a         man receive with his wife. He should do all         he can to help make the ball successful,         especially if his name appears on the invitation.         He should assist in finding partners         for the women, taking the chaperones into         supper, preventing the men from selfishly         remaining in the dressing-room, and at the         end escorting unattended women to their         carriages.           When a formal supper is served, he takes         into supper the leading chaperone.      DUTIES OF HOSTESS. As a ball is an entertainment         for dancing, it is better to give two         small balls where the guests are not crowded         than one where they are. It is permissible         for a hostess not having sufficient room to         hire rooms in some place suitable for the         purpose.           In selecting guests, it is wise to have more         men present than women.           The hostess should see to it that the rooms         are well ventilated and well lighted. An         awning and a carpet from the street to the         hall door should be provided.           The hostess should stand near the door,         prepared to receive the guests as they enter,         shaking hands with each one, friend or         stranger, and introducing any woman who         may receive with her.           A hostess herself should not dance until         late in the evening, unless she knows that         nearly all her guests have arrived.           A wise hostess will personally see that the         women are provided with partners, and that         diffident young men are introduced.           The hostess should see that the floor is         suitable for dancing, that music is arranged,         programs printed, that dressing-rooms, one         for the"]]]
