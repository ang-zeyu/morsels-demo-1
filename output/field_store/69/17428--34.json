It is obvious that he could not have been  intrusted with a command so difficult and of so great responsibility  without practical experience in navigation; and, as it will appear  hereafter that he was in the army several years during the civil war,  probably from 1592 to 1598, his experience in navigation must have been  obtained anterior to that, in the years of his youth and early manhood.    Brouage offered an excellent opportunity for such an employment. Its port  was open to the commerce of foreign nations, and a large number of vessels,  as we have already seen, was employed in the yearly distribution of the  salt of Saintonge, not only in the seaport towns of France, but in England  and on the Continent. In these coasting expeditions, Champlain was  acquiring skill in navigation which was to be of very great service to him  in his future career, and likewise gathering up rich stores of experience,  coming in contact with a great variety of men, observing their manners and  customs, and quickening and strengthening his natural taste for travel and  adventure. It is not unlikely that he was, at least during some of these  years, employed in the national marine, which was fully employed in  guarding the coast against foreign invasion, and in restraining the power  of the Huguenots, who were firmly seated at Rochelle with a sufficient  naval force to give annoyance to their enemies along the whole western  coast of France.    In 1592, or soon after that date, Champlain was appointed quarter-master in  the royal army in Brittany, discharging the office several years, until, by  the peace of Vervins, in 1598, the authority of Henry IV. was firmly  established throughout the kingdom. This war in Brittany constituted the  closing scene of that mighty struggle which had been agitating the nation,  wasting its resources and its best blood for more than half a century. It  began in its incipient stages as far back as a decade following 1530, when  the preaching of Calvin in the Kingdom of Navarre began to make known his  transcendent power. The new faith, which was making rapid strides in other  countries, easily awakened the warm heart and active temperament of the  French. The principle of private judgment which lies at the foundation of  Protestant teaching, its spontaneity as opposed to a faith imposed by  authority, commended it especially to the learned and thoughtful, while the  same principle awakened the quick and impulsive nature of the masses. The  effort to put down the movement by the extermination of those engaged in  it, proved not only unsuccessful, but recoiled, as usual in such cases,  upon the hand that struck the blow. Confiscations, imprisonments, and the  stake daily increased the number of those which these severe measures were  intended to diminish. It was impossible to mark its progress. When at  intervals all was calm and placid on the surface, at the same time, down  beneath, where the eye of the detective could not penetrate, in the closet  of the scholar and at the fireside of the artisan and the peasant, the new  gospel, silently and without observation, was spreading like an  all-pervading leaven. [11]    In 1562, the repressed forces of the Huguenots could no longer be  restrained, and, bursting forth, assumed the form of organized civil war.  With the exception of temporary lulls, originating in policy or exhaustion,  there was no cessation of arms until 1598. Although it is usually and  perhaps best described as a religious war, the struggle was not altogether  between the Catholic and the Huguenot or Protestant. There were many other  elements that came in to give their coloring to the contest, and especially  to determine the course and policy of individuals.    The ultra-Catholic desired to maintain the old faith with all its ancient  prestige and power, and to crush out and exclude every other. With this  party were found the court, certain ambitious and powerful families, and  nearly all the officials of the church. In close alliance with it were the  Roman Pontiff, the King of Spain, and the Catholic princes of Germany.    The Huguenots desired what is commonly known as liberty of conscience;  or, in other words, freedom to worship God according to their own views  of the truth, without interference or restriction. And in close alliance  with them were the Queen of England and the Protestant princes of  Germany.    Personal motives, irrespective of principle, united many persons and  families with either of these great parties which seemed most likely to  subserve their private ambitions. The feudal system was nearly extinct in  form, but its spirit was still alive. The nobles who had long held sway in  some of the provinces of France desired to hold them as distinct and  separate governments, and to transmit them as an inheritance to their  children. This motive often determined their political association.    During the most of the period of this long civil war, Catherine de Medicis  [12] was either regent or in the exercise of a controlling influence in the  government of France. She was a woman of commanding person and  extraordinary ability, skilful in intrigue, without conscience and without  personal religion. She hesitated at no crime, however black, if through it  she could attain the objects of her ambition. Neither of her three sons,  Francis, Charles, and Henry, who came successively to the throne, left any  legal heir to succeed him. The succession became, therefore, at an early  period, a question of great interest. If not the potent cause, it was  nevertheless intimately connected with most of the bloodshed of that bloody  period.    A solemn league was entered into by a large number of the ultra-Catholic  nobles to secure two avowed objects, the succession of a Catholic prince to  the throne, and the utter extermination of the Huguenots. Henry, King of  Navarre, afterwards Henry IV. of France, admitted to be the legal heir to  the throne, was a Protestant, and therefore by the decree of the League  disqualified to succeed. Around his standard, the Huguenots rallied in  great numbers. With him were associated the princes of Conde, of royal  blood, and many other distinguished nobles. They contended for the double  purpose of securing the throne to its rightful heir and of emancipating and  establishing the Protestant faith.    But there was another class, acting indeed with one or the other of these  two great parties, nevertheless influenced by very different motives. It  was composed of moderate Catholics, who cared little for the political  schemes and civil power of the Roman Pontiff, who dreaded the encroachments  of the King of Spain, who were firmly patriotic and desired the  aggrandizement and glory of France.    The ultra-Catholic party was, for a long period, by far the most numerous  and the more powerful; but the Huguenots were sufficiently strong to keep  up the struggle with varying success for nearly forty years.    After the alliance of Henry of Navarre with Henry III. against the League,  the moderate Catholics and the Huguenots were united and fought together  under the royal standard until the close of the war in 1598.    Champlain was personally engaged in the war in Brittany for several years.  This province on the western coast of France, constituting a tongue of land  jutting out as it were into the sea, isolated and remote from the great  centres of the war, was among the last to surrender to the arms of Henry  IV. The Huguenots had made but little progress within its borders. The Duke  de Mercoeur [13] had been its governor for sixteen years, and had bent all  his energies to separate it from France, organize it into a distinct  kingdom, and transmit its sceptre to his own family.    Champlain informs us that he was quarter-master in the army of the king  under Marshal d'Aumont, de Saint Luc, and Marshal de Brissac, distinguished  officers of the French army, who had been successively in command in that  province for the purpose of reducing it into obedience to Henry IV.    Marshal d'Aumont [14] took command of the army in Brittany in 1592. He was  then seventy years of age, an able and patriotic officer, a moderate  Catholic, and an uncompromising foe of the League. He had expressed his  sympathy for Henry IV. a long time before the death of Henry III., and when  that event occurred he immediately espoused the cause of the new monarch,  and was at once appointed to the command of one of the three great  divisions of the French army. He received a wound at the siege of the  Chateau de Camper, in Brittany, of which he died on the 19th of August,  1595.    De Saint Luc, already in the service in Brittany, as lieutenant-general  under D'Aumont, continued, after the death of that officer, in sole  command. [15] He raised the siege of the Chateau de Camper after the death  of his superior, and proceeded to capture several other posts, marching  through the lower part of the province, repressing the license of the  soldiery, and introducing order and discipline. On the 5th of September,  1596, he was appointed grand-master of the artillery of France, which  terminated his special service in Brittany.    The king immediately appointed in his place Marshal de Brissac, [16] an  officer of broad experience, who added other great qualities to those of an  able soldier. No distinguished battles signalized the remaining months of  the civil war in this province. The exhausted resources and faltering  courage of the people could no longer be sustained by the flatteries or  promises of the Duke de Mercoeur. Wherever the squadrons of the marshal  made their appearance the flag of truce was raised, and town, city, and  fortress vied with each other in their haste to bring their ensigns and lay  them at his feet.    On the seventh of June, 1598, the peace of Vervins was published in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6659"],[0,"History of King Charles the Second of England (#3)"],[1,"ity, which was, however, soon after disbanded.  The queen's fears were, nevertheless, not allayed. She began to make  arrangements for escaping from the kingdom in ease it should become  necessary to do so. She sent a certain faithful friend and servant to  Portsmouth with orders to get some vessels ready, so that she could  fly there with her children and embark at a moment's notice, if these  dangers and alarms should continue.    She did not, however, have occasion to avail herself of these  preparations. Affairs seemed to take a more favorable turn. The king  came back from Scotland. He was received by his people, on his arrival,  with apparent cordiality and good will. The queen was, of course,  rejoiced to welcome him home, and she felt relieved and protected by  his presence. The city of London, which had been the main seat of  disaffection and hostility to the royal family, began to show symptoms  of returning loyalty and friendly regard. In reciprocation for this,  the king determined on making a grand entry into the city, to pay a  sort of visit to the authorities. He rode, on this occasion, in a  splendid chariot of state, with the little prince by his side. Queen  Henrietta came next, in an open carriage of her own, and the other  children, with other carriages, followed in the train. A long cortege  of guards and attendants, richly dressed and magnificently mounted,  preceded and followed the royal family, while the streets were lined  with thousands of spectators, who waved handkerchiefs and banners, and  shouted God save the king! In the midst of this scene of excitement  and triumph, Henrietta rode quietly along, her anxieties relieved, her  sorrows and trials ended, and her heart bounding with happiness and  hope. She was once more, as she conceived, reunited to her husband and  her children, and reconciled to the people of her realm. She thought  her troubles were over Alas! they had, on the contrary, scarcely begun.          CHAPTER II.    PRINCE CHARLES'S MOTHER.        The indications and promises of returning peace and happiness which  gave Prince Charles's mother so much animation and hope after the  return of her husband from Scotland were all very superficial and  fallacious. The real grounds of the quarrel between the king and his  Parliament, and of the feelings of alienation and ill will cherished  toward the queen, were all, unfortunately, as deep and extensive as  ever; and the storm, which lulled treacherously for a little time,  broke forth soon afterward anew, with a frightful violence which it  was evident that nothing could withstand. This new onset of disaster  and calamity was produced in such a way that Henrietta had to reproach  herself with being the cause of its coming.    She had often represented to the king that, in her opinion, one main  cause of the difficulties he had suffered was that he did not act  efficiently and decidedly, and like a man, in putting down the  opposition manifested against him on the part of his subjects; and  now, soon after his return from Scotland, on some new spirit of  disaffection showing itself in Parliament, she urged him to act at  once energetically and promptly against it. She proposed to him to  take an armed force with him, and proceed boldly to the halls where  the Parliament was assembled, and arrest the leaders of the party who  were opposed to him. There were five of them who were specially  prominent. The queen believed that if these five men were seized and  imprisoned in the Tower, the rest would be intimidated and overawed,  and the monarch's lost authority and power would be restored again.    The king was persuaded, partly by the dictates of his own judgment,  and partly by the urgency of the queen, to make the attempt. The  circumstances of this case, so far as the action of the king was  concerned in them, are fully related in the history of Charles the  First. Here we have only to speak of the queen, who was left in a state  of great suspense and anxiety in her palace at Whitehall while her  husband was gone on his dangerous mission.    The plan of the king to make this irruption into the great legislative  assembly of the nation had been kept, so they supposed, a very profound  secret, lest the members whom he was going to arrest should receive  warning of their danger and fly. When the time arrived, the king bade  Henrietta farewell, saying that she might wait there an hour, and if  she received no ill news from him during that time, she might be sure  that he had been successful, and that he was once more master of his  kingdom. The queen remained in the apartment where the king had left  her, looking continually at the watch which she held before her, and  counting the minutes impatiently as the hands moved slowly on. She had  with her one confidential friend, the Lady Carlisle, who sat with her  and seemed to share her solicitude, though she had not been entrusted  with the secret. The time passed on. No ill tidings came; and at length  the hour fully expired, and Henrietta, able to contain herself no  longer, exclaimed with exultation, \"Rejoice with me; the hour is gone.  From this time my husband is master of his realm. His enemies in  Parliament are all arrested before this time, and his kingdom is  henceforth his own.\"    It certainly is possible for kings and queens to have faithful friends,  but there are so many motives and inducements to falsehood and treachery  in court, that it is _not_ possible, generally, for them to distinguish  false friends from true. The Lady Carlisle was a confederate with some  of the very men whom Charles had gone to arrest. On receiving this  intimation of their danger, she sent immediately to the houses of  Parliament, which were very near at hand, and the obnoxious members  received warning in time to fly. The hour had indeed elapsed, but the  king had met with several unexpected delays, both in his preparations  for going, and on his way to the House of Commons, so that when at  last he entered, the members were gone. His attempt, however,  unsuccessful as it was, evoked a general storm of indignation and  anger, producing thus all the exasperation which was to have been  expected from the measure, without in any degree accomplishing its  end. The poor queen was overwhelmed with confusion and dismay when she  learned the result. She had urged her husband forward to an extremely  dangerous and desperate measure, and then by her thoughtless  indiscretion had completely defeated the end. A universal and utterly  uncontrollable excitement burst like a clap of thunder upon the country  as this outrage, as they termed it, of the king became known, and the  queen was utterly appalled at the extent and magnitude of the mischief  she had done.    The mischief was irremediable. The spirit of resentment and indignation  which the king's action had aroused, expressed itself in such tumultuous  and riotous proceedings as to render the continuance of the royal  family in London no longer safe. They accordingly removed up the river  to Hampton Court, a famous palace on the Thames, not many miles from  the city. There they remained but a very short time. The dangers which  beset them were evidently increasing. It was manifest that the king  must either give up what he deemed the just rights and prerogatives  of the crown, or prepare to maintain them by war. The queen urged him  to choose the latter alternative. To raise the means for doing this,  she proposed that she should herself leave the country, taking with  her, her jewels, and such other articles of great value as could be  easily carried away, and by means of them and her personal exertions,  raise funds and forces to aid her husband in the approaching struggle.    The king yielded to the necessity which seemed to compel the adoption  of this plan. He accordingly set off to accompany Henrietta to the  shore. She took with her the young Princess Mary; in fact, the  ostensible object of her journey was to convey her to her young husband,  the Prince of Orange, in Holland. In such infantile marriages as theirs,  it is not customary, though the marriage ceremony be performed, for  the wedded pair to live together till they arrive at years a little  more mature.    The queen was to embark at Dover. Dover was in those days the great  port of egress from England to the Continent. There was, and is still,  a great castle on the cliffs to guard the harbor and the town. These  cliffs are picturesque and high, falling off abruptly in chalky  precipices to the sea. Among them at one place is a sort of dell, by  which there is a gradual descent to the water. King Charles stood upon  the shore when Henrietta sailed away, watching the ship as it receded  from his view, with tears in his eyes. With all the faults,  characteristic of her nation, which Henrietta possessed, she was now  his best and truest friend, and when she was gone he felt that he was  left desolate and alone in the midst of the appalling dangers by which  he was environed.    The king went back to Hampton Court. Parliament sent him a request  that he would come and reside nearer to the capital, and enjoined upon  him particularly not to remove the young Prince of Wales. In the mean  time they began to gather together their forces, and to provide  munitions of war. The king did the same. He sent the young prince to  the western part of the kingdom, and retired himself to the northward,  to the city of York, which he made his head-quarters. In a word, both  parties prepared for war.    In the mean time, Queen Henrietta was very successful in her attempts  to obtain aid for her husband in Holland. Her misfortunes awakened  pity, with which, through her beauty, and the graces of her conversation  and address, there was mingled a feeling analogous to love. Then,  besides, there was something in her spirit of earnest and courageous  devotion to her husband in the hours of his"]]]
