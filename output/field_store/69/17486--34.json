They made the fire  bigger and bigger, but the meat would not cook.    Then the gods were very cross.    Some one said, \"Give me my share, and I will make the meat cook.\"    The gods looked to see who was talking. There in an oak tree was a big  eagle.    [Illustration: THE THREE GODS TRY TO COOK THE OX.]    The gods were so hungry that they said, \"Well, we will.\"           *       *       *       *       *              supper        stuck           enough            minute        claws           stones            pole          against         flew    The supper was ready in a minute.    Then the eagle flew down to get his share. He took the four legs  and there was not much left but the ribs.    This made Loki cross for he was very hungry. He took a long pole  to hit the eagle. But the pole stuck to the eagle's claws. The other  end stuck to Loki.    Then the eagle flew away. He did not fly high. He flew just high  enough for Loki to hit against the stones.           *       *       *       *       *              please        giant           flying            tried         feathers        suit    Loki said, \"Please let me go! Oh, please let me go!\"    But the eagle said, \"No, you tried to kill me. I will not let you go.\"    And the eagle hit him against the stones.    Loki said again, \"Please let me go!\"    But the eagle said, \"No, I have you now.\"    Then Loki knew the eagle was a giant and not a bird.    This giant had a suit of eagle's feathers. He was flying in his eagle  suit when he saw Loki.           *       *       *       *       *              city          beautiful       apples            felt          growing         young    Now the gods lived in a city named Asgard.    In this city Idun kept the beautiful golden apples. When the gods  felt they were growing old, they ate the apples and were young again.    The giant wanted to be like the gods. So he said to Loki, \"I will  let you go, if you will get me the apples of Idun.\"    [Illustration: IDUN WITH HER APPLES.]    But Loki said, \"I can't do that.\"            *       *       *       *       *              bumped        gate            putting            stayed        golden          morning    So the eagle bumped him on the stones again.    Then Loki said, \"I can't stand this. I will get the apples for you.\"    Loki and the eagle went to the city. The eagle stayed by the gate, but  Loki went into the city. He went up to Idun. She was putting the  apples into a beautiful golden box.    [Illustration: LOKI AND IDUN]    Loki said, \"Good morning, Idun Those are beautiful apples.\"    And Idun said, \"Yes, they are beautiful.\" \"I saw some just like them,  the other day,\" said Loki.    [Illustration: IDUN WITH HER APPLES.]              strange       show            bring         picked    Idun knew there were no other apples like these, and she said, \"That  is strange. I would like to see them.\"    Loki said, \"Come with me and I will show them to you. It is only a  little way. Bring your apples with you.\"    As soon as Idun was out of the gates the eagle flew down. He picked  her up in his claws. Then he flew away with her to his home.            *       *       *       *       *              after         pale            falcon            passed        story           began    Day after day passed and Idun did not come back. The gods did not have  the golden apples to eat, so they began to get old.    At last they said, \"Who let the apples go?\"    Then Loki looked pale and the gods said, \"Loki, you did it.\" And Loki  said, \"Yes, I did.\"    [Illustration: THE GODS ASK WHERE IDUN IS.]    He did not tell a story that time.    Then Loki said, \"I will get Idun and the apples back, if I may have  the falcon suit.\"            *       *       *       *       *              changed       faster    The gods said, \"You may have it, if you will bring the apples back.\"    Loki put on the falcon suit and flew away. He looked like a big bird  flying.    When Loki came to the giant's home, he was glad the giant was not  there. He changed Idun into a nut and then flew away with the nut.    [Illustration: THE GIANT SEES THE BIRD FLY AWAY]    When the giant came home, Idun was gone. The golden apples were gone,  too.    Then the giant put on his eagle suit and flew after Loki.    Loki heard the eagle coming. Loki flew faster.           *       *       *       *       *              breath        over            changed            walls         blazed          burned    Poor Loki was all out of breath. The eagle flew faster and faster.    Then the gods got on the walls to look for Loki. They saw him coming  and the eagle after him.    So they made fires on the walls. At last Loki flew over the walls.    Then the gods lighted the fires. The fires blazed up.    The eagle flew into the fire and was burned.    As soon as Loki put the nut down, it changed to Idun.    The gods ate the beautiful golden apples and were young again.    [Illustration]          HOW THOR GOT THE HAMMER.                proud         porch           lying            journeys      tricks          wife            always        alone           asleep    Sif was Thor's wife.    Sif had long golden hair. Thor was very proud of Sif's golden hair.    Thor was always going on long journeys. One day he went off and left  Sif alone. She went out on the porch and fell asleep.    Loki came along. He was always playing tricks.    He saw Sif lying asleep. He said, \"I am going to cut off her hair.\"    [Illustration]    So Loki went up on the porch and cut off Sif's golden hair.            *       *       *       *       *              where         around          crying            answer        found           somebody    When Sif woke up and saw that her hair was gone, she cried and  cried. Then she ran to hide. She did not want Thor to see her.    When Thor came home, he could not find Sif.    \"Sif! Sif!\" he called, \"Where are you?\"    But Sif did not answer.    Thor looked all around the house. At last he found her crying.    [Illustration: \"OH THOR, ALL MY HAIR, IS GONE!\"]    \"Oh, Thor, look, all my hair is gone! Somebody has cut it off. It was  a man. He ran away with it.\"            *       *       *       *       *              angry         mischief        right            getting       cutting         something    Then Thor was very angry. He said, \"I know it was Loki. He is always  getting into mischief. Just wait until I get him!\"    And Thor went out to find Loki. Pretty soon he found him.    Thor said, \"Did you cut off Sif's hair?\" Loki said, \"Yes, I did.\"    \"Then you must pay for cutting off my wife's hair,\" said Thor.    [Illustration: \"DID YOU CUT OFF SIF'S HAIR?\"]    \"All right,\" said Loki, \"I will get you something better than the  hair.\"            *       *       *       *       *              ground        thumb           beads            dwarfs        crooked         crown                          worked    Loki went down, down into the ground to the home of the dwarfs. It was  very dark down there. The only light came from the dwarfs' fires.    The dwarfs were ugly little black men. They were not any bigger than  your thumb. They had crooked backs and crooked legs. Their eyes looked  like black beads.    [Illustration: LOKI AND THE DWARFS.]    Loki said, \"Can you make me a gold crown that will grow like real  hair?\"    The dwarfs said, \"Yes, we can.\" So the busy little dwarfs worked all  night.           *       *       *       *       *              morning       showed          laughed            spear         wonderful       three            ship          standing        brother            nobody        stepped         else    When morning came the dwarfs gave Loki his crown of golden hair. They  gave him a spear and a ship, too.    [Illustration: THE DWARFS BRING TO LOKI THE SHIP, THE SPEAR AND THE  CROWN OF HAIR.]    Loki took the things up to Asgard, where the gods all lived.    Then the gods all came up to him. He showed them the things.    The gods said, \"They are very wonderful.\"    And Loki said, \"Oh, nobody else can make such things as my little  dwarfs.\"    A little dwarf, named Brok, was standing near by. He heard Loki say  that. Then he stepped up and said, \"My brother can make just as good  things as these.\"    Loki laughed and said, \"If you can get three things as wonderful as  these, I will give you my head.\"    [Illustration: BROK TELLS LOKI THAT HIS BROTHER CAN MAKE BETTER GIFTS]            *       *       *       *       *              anywhere      misses            spear         mark    Brok went down into the ground where his little dwarfs were working.    Brok's brother was named Sindre. He said to his brother, \"Loki says  that you can't make such nice things as his dwarfs can. He said that  he would give me his head if I could get him such wonderful things as  his.\"    This made the dwarfs angry. Their eyes grew big. They said, \"He will  see what we can do.\"    Sindre wanted to know what the wonderful things were.    Brok said, \"Loki has a golden crown that will grow like real hair. A  ship that can go anywhere. A spear that never misses the mark.\"    \"We will show him,\" said the dwarfs.           *       *       *       *       *       *              burning       blow            pigskin            bellows       blew            blowing    The dwarfs soon had the fires burning. Then Sindre put a pigskin into  the fire.    He gave the bellows to Brok and said, \"Now blow as hard as you can.\"    Then Sindre went out. Brok blew and blew.    A little fly came in and bit him on the hand.    The fly bit him so hard that Brok thought he would have to stop  blowing, but he did not.    Then Sindre came back. He took out a golden"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7847"],[0,"Jack North's Treasure Hunt; Or, Daring Adventures in South America (#3)"],[1,"had a long talk with me this  morning, and I told him you were just the chap for the place, young and  capable. He nodded his head and I could see that you were as good as  taken. Of course we shall miss you, but it's a trip a youngster like you  can't afford to miss.\"    \"I should like to go, Mr. Henshaw, and I thank you for your kind words.\"    \"Don't cost nothing,\" returned the bluff foreman, as he started homeward.    Jack was too happy over his prospects to mind the baleful looks of Furniss  the next day, or to hear the jibes of Fret Offut. Could he have foreseen  the startling result he must have been bound with dismay.    The following Monday, when the day's work was done and he was leaving the  shop, Mr. Henshaw came along, and slapping him on the shoulder, said: \"Let  me congratulate you, my lad. It is just as I said; you are going to South  America,--if you will.\"    \"It seems too good to be true, Mr. Henshaw.\" \"It's the blessed truth and I  know it I don't blame you for feeling well over such an appointment, for  it is something any of us might be glad of. But you deserve it.\"    The appearance of Furniss checked Jack's reply. He could see the other  understood that he had lost. He had another proof of the fact before he  got home from Fret Offut, who said:    \"Feel mighty stuck up, don't yer? But let me tell yer,'twon't do any  good.\"    This was the first time he had spoken to Jack since he had begun work in  the shops, and our hero made no reply.    The following day, as he was about to leave the shop at the close of his  work, Jack was accosted by Furniss, who asked him to assist him a moment  at the big hammer.    Jack started at once to his help, noticing that the building was  completely deserted at the time, except for the second boss and himself;  even Henshaw, who generally stayed until after the workmen had left, was  gone.    His surprise may be imagined then when he saw Fret Offut step from behind  a huge boiler as he approached. Still he did not dream of any sinister  purpose in the minds of the two, and he was about to stoop to lift a piece  of iron at the request of Furniss, when he discovered a bar of iron so  suspended over his head from the cross timber that a slight movement on  his part was sure to bring it down upon his head.    No sooner had he seen his precarious situation than he started back, when  Fret Offut flung a heavy slug at his feet. The effect was startling, for  the concussion on the floor sent the menacing bar overhead downward with  fearful force.    Jack succeeded in dodging the blow so far that he escaped the full weight  of the falling iron, which struck the floor endwise with a heavy thud. But  before he could get beyond its reach the massive bar tipped over, falling  in such way as to strike him in the side of the head, and felling him  senseless to the floor.    In a moment Furniss and Offut were bending over him with anxious looks on  their grimy countenances.    \"Is he killed?\" asked the younger of the twain.    Jack answered the question himself by opening his eyes, though he was  still too bewildered to attempt to rise.    \"What did you do that for?\" he demanded.    \"Do what?\" questioned Fret Offut. \"You know well enough. You fixed that  bar so it would hit me.\"    \"Hear the boy talk!\" came from Furniss. \"It is true. If I get the chance--\"    \"Stop, you shan't get us into trouble,\" yelled the man, in a rage.    \"Not much,\" put in Offut. \"Let's teach him a lesson he won't forget!\"    \"So we will,\" answered Furniss; and both started forward to attack Jack.          Chapter IV    Just in Time        Though still somewhat dazed by the blow on his head, Jack realized that  the unprincipled twain in their desperation would stop short of no crime  in order to carry out their purpose.    Thus Furniss had barely laid his hand on him before he was on his feet  ready to fight for his life if necessary.    Flinging aside the second boss, he turned to meet the assault of Fret  Offut, whom he caught by the collar and flung headlong upon a pile of  scrap iron and ashes still warm from the furnace.    Shrieking with pain the big youth scrambled to his feet and began to dance  around as if he had a coal of fire in the heel of his shoe.    Furniss rallied to grapple anew with Jack, but though a strong man he  found his match. Used to hard work all of his life, Jack's sinews seemed  like bands of steel and there was no breaking from his grasp.    \"Help, Offut--quick!\" cried Furniss, as his head was jabbed into the midst  of a box of coal. \"He--he'll kill me!\" spluttered the discomfited man.    But Fret Offut failed for good reasons to heed the supplications of his  friend.    The next instant Furniss managed to get a hold on Jack which enabled him  to throw him upon the floor.    \"Go to South America, will you?\" cried the exultant Furniss. \"Let that  settle it,\" and he aimed a furious blow at his victim's head.    But Jack was too nimble to remain still and receive whatever attack the  other might rain upon him, and when Furniss' fist descended it missed its  mark, to strike plump upon the sharp edge of a bar of iron, peeling the  skin on its back from knuckle to wrist.    At the same time Jack turned his adversary and, clearing him, vaulted to  his feet, carrying the other backwards by the impetuous movement and  sending him headfirst into a bucket of water.    Before he could rise Jack had caught him by the throat with one hand, and  he immediately began to \"churn\" the other's head up and down in the black  water, while the discomfited wretch, trying in vain to break away,  exclaimed in gasps:    \"Help--don't--you'll kill me! I--Of--ut--h-e-l-p--murder!\"    \"Will you promise to let me alone after this?\" demanded Jack, giving his  victim another plunge in the bucket.    \"Yes. Let me go or I'll tell Fowler. Oh--oh!\"    \"Tell Fowler, will you?\"    \"No--no! Let me go!\"    \"You promise it?\"    \"Yes,\" spluttered the man as soon as he could speak.    \"I think that will be enough this time.\" declared the triumphant Jack. \"If  I could get my hands on you, Fret Offut, I would give you a dose of the  same medicine.\"    \"I ain't done nothing!\" cried the terrified youth. \"Don't you dare to  touch me!\" and by that time he had reached the door, to disappear an  instant later.    Feeling that he had nothing more to fear from his enemies, Jack left the  shop to go to his home, his mind soon occupied with thoughts of his South  American voyage rather than with the more unpleasant memory of his recent  trouble with young Offut and Furniss.    Before going direct to his home to tell the news there, Jack sought  another home that he might first break the account of his good fortune to  one whose fair countenance had been in his mind's eye all the afternoon.    He knew the hardest part of his starting on his long voyage would be in  tearing himself away from a certain blue-eyed damsel named Jenny Moodhead.    At her home he was met by the girl's mother, who, in answer to his  inquiries for Jenny, said:    \"Jane is not here, and I do not see why you have not met her, as she said  she was going to see you as you came from the shops. I am afraid something  has happened to her.\"    Without further loss of time, Jack started to retrace the way to the  engine shops, though going by a different course from that which he had  come.    He had got about half way there, and was passing near an old ruined mill,  which stood more than half over the river, when he was startled by the  sound of a voice, which was too familiar for him not to recognize.    \"Don't you dare come any nearer, Fret Offut! Stand back, or the worst will  be your own!\"    It was Jenny speaking, and as Jack dashed down to the side of the old mill  he discovered her at the further extremity of the ruins defiantly facing  young Offut, who was kept from approaching any nearer to her by a club she  held in her hands, uplifted over her head.    Between the two was a gulf of dark waters a dozen feet or more in width,  but spanned by a plank over which the girl had evidently passed in  reaching her place of retreat.    \"I'll take up the plank so you can't come back!\" declared young Offut.  \"You see if you do not answer me in a becoming manner I can--\"    Fret Offut did not have the opportunity to finish his sentence before a  stout hand was laid on his shoulder and he was plunged headfirst into the  river. \"Get out the best you can!\" cried Jack North.    He turned to the girl. \"Has he dared so much as to lay a ringer on you,  Jenny?\"    \"Oh, Jack! I am so glad to see you! No, he had not touched me, though I  don't know what he might have done if you had not come. You won't let him  drown?\"    \"It would serve him about right, if I did. But he will take care of  himself. See, he is crawling out below the mill. Come with me, Jenny, for  I have important news to tell you. I am going to South America!\"    \"To South America! Oh, Jack, why?\"    \"The firm want me to go, and they will pay me well for my services. I am  to look after some machinery that is to be shipped.\"    \"But you will come back?\" questioned Jenny, anxiously.    \"Sure, as soon as my task is done. But now tell me about Fret Offut.\"    \"Oh, there is not much to tell. He--he wanted to be sweet on me and--and I  wouldn't have it. That made him angry, and he followed me to this place,  and--you saw the rest.\"    \"I hope he won't bother you again.\"    \"I don't think he will,\" said Jenny. \"Anyway, I'll keep my eyes open for  him.\"    After that Jack spent a pleasant hour in the company of the girl who was  his dearest friend, and then went home to prepare for his trip of so many  thousand miles.    His parents already knew something about the proposed journey, so they  were not much surprised. They had seen Mr. Fowler and talked it over with  the manufacturer. Mrs. North did what she could to get Jack's outfit ready  for him.    \"I'll be glad to leave such fellows as Fret Offut"]]]
