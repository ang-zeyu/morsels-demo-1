You'll find it comfortable and not  further from the school than a good constitutional. Mrs. Williamson is  the dearest soul alive; and she is one of those old-fashioned cooks who  feed you on feasts of fat things and whose price is above rubies.    \"Her husband, Robert, or Bob, as he is commonly called despite his sixty  years, is quite a character in his way. He is an amusing old gossip,  with a turn for racy comment and a finger in everybody's pie. He knows  everything about everybody in Lindsay for three generations back.    \"They have no living children, but Old Bob has a black cat which is his  especial pride and darling. The name of this animal is Timothy and  as such he must always be called and referred to. Never, as you value  Robert's good opinion, let him hear you speaking of his pet as 'the  cat,' or even as 'Tim.' You will never be forgiven and he will not  consider you a fit person to have charge of the school.    \"You shall have my room, a little place over the kitchen, with a ceiling  that follows the slant of the roof down one side, against which you will  bump your head times innumerable until you learn to remember that it is  there, and a looking glass which will make one of your eyes as small as  a pea and the other as big as an orange.    \"But to compensate for these disadvantages the supply of towels is  generous and unexceptionable; and there is a window whence you will  daily behold an occidental view over Lindsay Harbour and the gulf beyond  which is an unspeakable miracle of beauty. The sun is setting over it  as I write and I see such a sea of glass mingled with fire as might have  figured in the visions of the Patmian seer. A vessel is sailing away  into the gold and crimson and pearl of the horizon; the big revolving  light on the tip of the headland beyond the harbour has just been  lighted and is winking and flashing like a beacon,                               \"'O'er the foam             Of perilous seas in faerie lands forlorn.'\"    \"Wire me if you can come; and if you can, report for duty on the  twenty-third of May.\"    Mr. Marshall, Senior, came in, just as Eric was thoughtfully folding up  his letter. The former looked more like a benevolent old clergyman or  philanthropist than the keen, shrewd, somewhat hard, although just and  honest, man of business that he really was. He had a round, rosy face,  fringed with white whiskers, a fine head of long white hair, and a  pursed-up mouth. Only in his blue eyes was a twinkle that would have  made any man who designed getting the better of him in a bargain think  twice before he made the attempt.    It was easily seen that Eric must have inherited his personal beauty and  distinction of form from his mother, whose picture hung on the dark wall  between the windows. She had died while still young, when Eric was a boy  of ten. During her lifetime she had been the object of the passionate  devotion of both her husband and son; and the fine, strong, sweet face  of the picture was a testimony that she had been worthy of their love  and reverence. The same face, cast in a masculine mold, was repeated in  Eric; the chestnut hair grew off his forehead in the same way; his eyes  were like hers, and in his grave moods they held a similar expression,  half brooding, half tender, in their depths.    Mr. Marshall was very proud of his son's success in college, but he had  no intention of letting him see it. He loved this boy of his, with the  dead mother's eyes, better than anything on earth, and all his hopes and  ambitions were bound up in him.    \"Well, that fuss is over, thank goodness,\" he said testily, as he  dropped into his favourite chair.    \"Didn't you find the programme interesting?\" asked Eric absently.    \"Most of it was tommyrot,\" said his father. \"The only things I liked  were Charlie's Latin prayer and those pretty little girls trotting up  to get their diplomas. Latin IS the language for praying in, I do  believe,--at least, when a man has a voice like Old Charlie's. There was  such a sonorous roll to the words that the mere sound of them made me  feel like getting down on my marrow bones. And then those girls were as  pretty as pinks, now weren't they? Agnes was the finest-looking of the  lot in my opinion. I hope it's true that you're courting her, Eric?\"    \"Confound it, father,\" said Eric, half irritably, half laughingly, \"have  you and David Baker entered into a conspiracy to hound me into matrimony  whether I will or no?\"    \"I've never said a word to David Baker on such a subject,\" protested Mr.  Marshall.    \"Well, you are just as bad as he is. He hectored me all the way home  from the college on the subject. But why are you in such a hurry to have  me married, dad?\"    \"Because I want a homemaker in this house as soon as may be. There has  never been one since your mother died. I am tired of housekeepers. And I  want to see your children at my knees before I die, Eric, and I'm an old  man now.\"    \"Well, your wish is natural, father,\" said Eric gently, with a glance at  his mother's picture. \"But I can't rush out and marry somebody off-hand,  can I? And I fear it wouldn't exactly do to advertise for a wife, even  in these days of commercial enterprise.\"    \"Isn't there ANYBODY you're fond of?\" queried Mr. Marshall, with the  patient air of a man who overlooks the frivolous jests of youth.    \"No. I never yet saw the woman who could make my heart beat any faster.\"    \"I don't know what you young men are made of nowadays,\" growled his  father. \"I was in love half a dozen times before I was your age.\"    \"You might have been 'in love.' But you never LOVED any woman until you  met my mother. I know that, father. And it didn't happen till you were  pretty well on in life either.\"    \"You're too hard to please. That's what's the matter, that's what's the  matter!\"    \"Perhaps I am. When a man has had a mother like mine his standard of  womanly sweetness is apt to be pitched pretty high. Let's drop the  subject, father. Here, I want you to read this letter--it's from Larry.\"    \"Humph!\" grunted Mr. Marshall, when he had finished with it. \"So Larry's  knocked out at last--always thought he would be--always expected it.  Sorry, too. He was a decent fellow. Well, are you going?\"    \"Yes, I think so, if you don't object.\"    \"You'll have a pretty monotonous time of it, judging from his account of  Lindsay.\"    \"Probably. But I am not going over in search of excitement. I'm going to  oblige Larry and have a look at the Island.\"    \"Well, it's worth looking at, some parts of the year,\" conceded Mr.  Marshall. \"When I'm on Prince Edward Island in the summer I always  understand an old Scotch Islander I met once in Winnipeg. He was always  talking of 'the Island.' Somebody once asked him, 'What island do you  mean?' He simply LOOKED at that ignorant man. Then he said, 'Why, Prince  Edward Island, mon. WHAT OTHER ISLAND IS THERE?' Go if you'd like to.  You need a rest after the grind of examinations before settling down to  business. And mind you don't get into any mischief, young sir.\"    \"Not much likelihood of that in a place like Lindsay, I fancy,\" laughed  Eric.    \"Probably the devil finds as much mischief for idle hands in Lindsay as  anywhere else. The worst tragedy I ever heard of happened on a backwoods  farm, fifteen miles from a railroad and five from a store. However, I  expect your mother's son to behave himself in the fear of God and man.  In all likelihood the worst thing that will happen to you over there  will be that some misguided woman will put you to sleep in a spare room  bed. And if that does happen may the Lord have mercy on your soul!\"        CHAPTER III. THE MASTER OF LINDSAY SCHOOL    One evening, a month later, Eric Marshall came out of the old,  white-washed schoolhouse at Lindsay, and locked the door--which was  carved over with initials innumerable, and built of double plank in  order that it might withstand all the assaults and batteries to which it  might be subjected.    Eric's pupils had gone home an hour before, but he had stayed to solve  some algebra problems, and correct some Latin exercises for his advanced  students.    The sun was slanting in warm yellow lines through the thick grove of  maples to the west of the building, and the dim green air beneath them  burst into golden bloom. A couple of sheep were nibbling the lush grass  in a far corner of the play-ground; a cow-bell, somewhere in the maple  woods, tinkled faintly and musically, on the still crystal air, which,  in spite of its blandness, still retained a touch of the wholesome  austerity and poignancy of a Canadian spring. The whole world seemed to  have fallen, for the time being, into a pleasant untroubled dream.    The scene was very peaceful and pastoral--almost too much so, the young  man thought, with a shrug of his shoulders, as he stood in the worn  steps and gazed about him. How was he going to put in a whole month  here, he wondered, with a little smile at his own expense.    \"Father would chuckle if he knew I was sick of it already,\" he thought,  as he walked across the play-ground to the long red road that ran past  the school. \"Well, one week is ended, at any rate. I've earned my own  living for five whole days, and that is something I could never say  before in all my twenty-four years of existence. It is an exhilarating  thought. But teaching the Lindsay district school is distinctly NOT  exhilarating--at least in such a well-behaved school as this, where  the pupils are so painfully good that I haven't even the traditional  excitement of thrashing obstreperous bad boys. Everything seems to go by  clock work in Lindsay educational institution. Larry must certainly have  possessed a marked gift for organizing and drilling. I feel as if I  were merely a big cog in an orderly machine that ran itself. However, I  understand that there are some pupils who haven't "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53416"],[0,"Only a Girl's Love (#3)"],[1,"771--Nan Haggard's Confession                   By Mary E.

THE EAGLE SERIES    Principally Copyrights      Elegant Colored Covers    \"THE RIGHT BOOKS AT THE RIGHT PRICE\"      While the books in the New Eagle Series are undoubtedly better value,  being bigger books, the stories offered to the public in this line  must not be underestimated. There are over four hundred copyrighted  books by famous authors, which cannot be had in any other line. No  other publisher in the world has a line that contains so many different  titles, nor can any publisher ever hope to secure books that will match  those in the Eagle Series in quality.    This is the pioneer line of copyrighted novels, and that it has struck  popular fancy just right is proven by the fact that for fifteen years  it has been the first choice of American readers. The only reason  that we can afford to give such excellent reading at such a low  price is that our unlimited capital and great organization enable us  to manufacture books more cheaply and to sell more of them without  expensive advertising, than any other publishers.       ALL TITLES ALWAYS IN PRINT     TO THE PUBLIC:--These books are sold by news dealers everywhere. If   your dealer does not keep them, and will not get them for you, send   direct to the publishers, in which case four cents must be added to   the price per copy to cover postage.        3--The Love of Violet Lee                      By Julia Edwards      4--For a Woman's Honor                        By Bertha M.
