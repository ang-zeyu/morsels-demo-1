With blimps operating from such bases, in addition to the patrols being  executed by other naval craft, we might conclude that no submarine could  venture within 100 miles of the American coast during daylight hours  without considerable risk of detection, and that blimps should be able  to make contribution to the safety of coastwise shipping and harbor  cities.    The patrol areas assigned to the blimps would have their flanks exposed,  but airship patrol would be co-ordinated with that of airplanes and  surface craft, guarding the areas farther out.    That this conclusion is reasonable is indicated by the fact that from  1939 on, Lakehurst Naval Air Station, under command of Commander G. H.  Mills had been doing just this, patroling areas all the way from  Nantucket to Cape Hatteras.                                         CHAPTER II                     British Airships in the First War          [Illustration: Airship over water]    Germany entered the first World War with high expectations as to one,  perhaps two of its new weapons of war. Its submarines might offset  Britain's superiority at sea, and certainly the Zeppelins, which had  proved themselves in four years of commercial flying, would be able to  cross the English Channel and carry the war to the island which had seen  no invasion since William the Conqueror.    No nation except Germany had Zeppelins. And as the German people began  to feel the pinch of the blockade, cutting their life line of food and  supplies, they brought increasing public pressure on High Command to use  these weapons to punish England.    Later commentators have speculated as to whether, if Germany had held  its fire, waited till it could assemble an overpowering force of  Zeppelins and submarines and stage a joint attack, it might not have  been able to force a quick decision.    But the Zeppelins were sent over a few at a time, as fast as they could  be built, and England was given time to devise defenses. These were  chiefly higher altitude airplanes, farther ranging anti-aircraft guns,  sky piercing searchlights, which combined to force the invaders to fly  continuously higher as the war wore on, as high as 25,000 feet at times,  with corresponding sacrifice of bombing accuracy. And when machine guns,  synchronized with the propellers, were mounted in airplane cockpits, and  began to spit inflammable bullets into the hydrogen filled bags and send  them down in flames, the duel took on more even terms.    Less spectacularly the Zeppelins were used on a wide scale as  reconnaissance and scouting craft, which flying fast and far were given  credit on more than one occasion for saving German Naval squadrons from  being cut off by superior Allied forces, were acknowledged even by the  British to have played an important part in the Battle of Jutland.    It is a little hard to realize today that whatever air battles were  waged over water in the last war were conducted chiefly by  lighter-than-air craft. Planes staged spectacular battles along the  Allied lines in France, but lack of range and carrying capacity forced  them to leave sea battles to the airship. As a measure of that  situation, the great hangars at Friedrichshafen, spawning ground of the  Zeppelins, one of the outstanding targets in all Europe if England were  to draw the dirigible's fangs, lay hardly more than a hundred miles from  the French borders, but even that distance was too great for effective  attack.    While these greater events were taking place, British airships, smaller  in size, less spectacular, were playing no small part in repelling  Germany's other threat, the submarine.                         Blimps Used to Search for U-Boats    Navy opinion around the world was skeptical at the beginning of the War  as to whether submarines would ever be practical. There were mechanical  troubles, accidents, usually costly. Even Germany, prior to 1914, used  to send an escort of warships along to convoy its subs to their  station--then send out for them afterward to bring them home again.    But the war was only a few weeks old when the captain of the U-9,  cruising down the Dutch coast, discovered that his gyro compass was off,  and when he got his bearings saw that he was 50 miles off course. He  wasted no breath, however, on many-syllabled German swear words, for off  on his southern horizon were the masts of three British ships. He dived,  came up alongside, and in 30 minutes, single handed, with well directed  torpedoes, had sunk in turn HMS Aboukir, Hogue and Cressy.    The morning of September 22, 1914, marked the beginning of a new era in  Naval warfare. The warring nations grew furiously busy building their  own U-boats and devising defenses against the enemy's. Among these  defenses was the non-rigid airship.    These two vehicles, so widely different, have much in common. If we may  be technical for a minute we may say that the airship and the submarine  are both buoyant bodies, completely immersed and floating in a  medium--air and water respectively--of changing pressures, that each  uses dual sets of steering gear and rudders to control direction and  altitude. And further, that the airship in 1941 faces the same division  of opinion as the submarine faced in 1914, as to whether, particularly  with rigid airships, it will ever be widely used and accepted.    In any event in 1914 there was an urgent and immediate job to be done.    Indicator nets and high explosive mines might give some protection to  harbors, might be stretched across steamship lanes and planted around  the hiding places of the submarines, if those could be discovered. But  troop ships and munition ships and food ships must be dispatched without  interruption across the tricky waters of the English Channel to France,  and for this purpose convoy escorts were devised, with camouflaged  warships zigzagging alongside, while high aloft in lookout stations men  with binoculars strained their eyes, searching the waters, ahead,  astern, alongside, their search lingering long over every bit of  floating wreckage--and there was a lot of it--to make sure it was not a  periscope.    These lookouts aboard ship quickly had a new ally in the air. As the  submarine menace grew, binoculars began to flash too from the fuselages  of bobbing blimps overhead. At a few hundred or perhaps a thousand feet  elevation they could see deep below the surface, and quickly learned to  recognize at considerable distance the tell-tale trail of bubbles or  feathered waters or smear of oil which denoted the enemy's presence,  might even pick out the shadowy form of the submerged craft itself.    The value of the airship in convoy was that it could fly slowly, could  throttle down its motors and march in step with its charges, cruise  ahead, alongside, behind. The very speed of its sister craft, the  airplane, handicapped its use in this field.    This characteristic of the blimp was even more useful in hunting U-boat  nests. The blimp could head into the wind, with its motors barely  turning over, hover for hours at zero speed over suspect areas. It could  fly at low altitudes, follow even slender clues. Seagulls following a  periscope sometimes gave highly useful information. An orange crate  moving against the tide attracted the attention of one alert pilot, for  the crate concealed a periscope, and the blimp dropped  bombs--successfully.    When a blimp discovered a submarine, it would give chase. With its 50  knots of reserve speed it was faster than any warship, much faster than  the poky wartime submarine, which could do only 10 or 12 knots on the  surface, much less than half that when submerged. If it was lucky the  airship might drop a bomb alongside before the sub got away.    And run for cover the submarine always did. It wanted no argument with a  ship which could see it under water, could out-run it, and might plunk a  bomb alongside before its presence was even suspected.    Airships did get their subs during the war. The records, always  incomplete in the case of submarines, whose casualties were invisible,  show that British blimps sighted 49 U-boats, led to the destruction of  27. But their greater usefulness lay in the fact that their mere  presence sent the underseas craft scuttling for submerged safety.    Between June, 1917, and the end of the war British blimps flew 1,500,000  miles, nearly as many as the Zeppelins. A French Commission made an  exhaustive study of dirigible operations after the war, and the late  Rear Admiral W. A. Moffett quoted from its reports in summarizing  lighter-than-air lessons taken from the war, when he told the Naval  Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives that \"as far as they  could learn, no steamer was ever molested by submarines when escorted by  a non-rigid airship.\"    France and Italy had long coast lines, used the blimps extensively along  the Bay of Biscay, the Mediterranean and the Adriatic, but England found  still greater use for them because it was an island. So blimp scouts  played a singularly useful role from Land's End to the Orkneys, stood  watch at the mouth of the Firth of Forth, the Solway, the Humber, and  the Thames.                                        CHAPTER III                       American Airships in Two Wars          [Illustration: Airship and hangar]    Compared to British and French airships, American dirigibles made a less  impressive record during the first war.    This for the reasons that there were few enemy activities in our waters  until the very end, and that there were few American airships to oppose  them. Virtually the entire airship organization had to be created after  we got into the war.    Naval attach√©s abroad had been watching blimp operations over the  English channel, and on the basis of rather meager information which  they furnished, Navy designers were working on plans, when the Secretary  of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5157"],[0,"How I Found Livingstone (#3)"],[1,"no deed of his own, he does not lose  credit; with the help of the Banyan, he is easily set on his feet again.    We will suppose, for the sake of illustrating how trade with the  interior is managed, that the Arab conveys by his caravan $5,000's worth  of goods into the interior. At Unyanyembe the goods are worth $10,000;  at Ujiji, they are worth $15,000: they have trebled in price. Five doti,  or $7.50, will purchase a slave in the markets of Ujiji that will fetch  in Zanzibar $30. Ordinary menslaves may be purchased for $6 which would  sell for $25 on the coast. We will say he purchases slaves to the full  extent of his means--after deducting $1,500 expenses of carriage to  Ujiji and back--viz. $3,500, the slaves--464 in number, at $7-50 per  head--would realize $13,920 at Zanzibar! Again, let us illustrate trade  in ivory. A merchant takes $5,000 to Ujiji, and after deducting $1,500  for expenses to Ujiji, and back to Zanzibar, has still remaining $3,500  in cloth and beads, with which he purchases ivory. At Ujiji ivory is  bought at $20 the frasilah, or 35 lbs., by which he is enabled with  $3,500 to collect 175 frasilahs, which, if good ivory, is worth about  $60 per frasilah at Zanzibar. The merchant thus finds that he has  realized $10,500 net profit! Arab traders have often done better than  this, but they almost always have come back with an enormous margin of  profit.    The next people to the Banyans in power in Zanzibar are the Mohammedan  Hindis. Really it has been a debateable subject in my mind whether the  Hindis are not as wickedly determined to cheat in trade as the Banyans.  But, if I have conceded the palm to the latter, it has been done very  reluctantly. This tribe of Indians can produce scores of unconscionable  rascals where they can show but one honest merchant. One of the  honestest among men, white or black, red or yellow, is a Mohammedan  Hindi called Tarya Topan. Among the Europeans at Zanzibar, he has become  a proverb for honesty, and strict business integrity. He is enormously  wealthy, owns several ships and dhows, and is a prominent man in the  councils of Seyd Burghash. Tarya has many children, two or three of  whom are grown-up sons, whom he has reared up even as he is himself. But  Tarya is but a representative of an exceedingly small minority.    The Arabs, the Banyans, and the Mohammedan Hindis, represent the higher  and the middle classes. These classes own the estates, the ships, and  the trade. To these classes bow the half-caste and the negro.    The next most important people who go to make up the mixed population of  this island are the negroes. They consist of the aborigines, Wasawahili,  Somalis, Comorines, Wanyamwezi, and a host of tribal representatives of  Inner Africa.    To a white stranger about penetrating Africa, it is a most interesting  walk through the negro quarters of the Wanyamwezi and the Wasawahili.  For here he begins to learn the necessity of admitting that negroes are  men, like himself, though of a different colour; that they have passions  and prejudices, likes and dislikes, sympathies and antipathies, tastes  and feelings, in common with all human nature. The sooner he perceives  this fact, and adapts himself accordingly, the easier will be his  journey among the several races of the interior. The more plastic his  nature, the more prosperous will be his travels.    Though I had lived some time among the negroes of our Southern States,  my education was Northern, and I had met in the United States black men  whom I was proud to call friends. I was thus prepared to admit any black  man, possessing the attributes of true manhood or any good qualities, to  my friendship, even to a brotherhood with myself; and to respect him  for such, as much as if he were of my own colour and race. Neither his  colour, nor any peculiarities of physiognomy should debar him with me  from any rights he could fairly claim as a man. \"Have these men--these  black savages from pagan Africa,\" I asked myself, \"the qualities  which make man loveable among his fellows? Can these men--these  barbarians--appreciate kindness or feel resentment like myself?\" was my  mental question as I travelled through their quarters and observed their  actions. Need I say, that I was much comforted in observing that they  were as ready to be influenced by passions, by loves and hates, as I  was myself; that the keenest observation failed to detect any great  difference between their nature and my own?    The negroes of the island probably number two-thirds of the entire  population. They compose the working-class, whether enslaved or free.  Those enslaved perform the work required on the plantations, the  estates, and gardens of the landed proprietors, or perform the work of  carriers, whether in the country or in the city. Outside the city they  may be seen carrying huge loads on their heads, as happy as possible,  not because they are kindly treated or that their work is light, but  because it is their nature to be gay and light-hearted, because they,  have conceived neither joys nor hopes which may not be gratified at  will, nor cherished any ambition beyond their reach, and therefore have  not been baffled in their hopes nor known disappointment.    Within the city, negro carriers may be heard at all hours, in couples,  engaged in the transportation of clove-bags, boxes of merchandise, &c.,  from store to \"godown\" and from \"go-down\" to the beach, singing a kind  of monotone chant for the encouragement of each other, and for the  guiding of their pace as they shuffle through the streets with  bare feet. You may recognise these men readily, before long, as old  acquaintances, by the consistency with which they sing the tunes they  have adopted. Several times during a day have I heard the same couple  pass beneath the windows of the Consulate, delivering themselves of  the same invariable tune and words. Some might possibly deem the songs  foolish and silly, but they had a certain attraction for me, and I  considered that they were as useful as anything else for the purposes  they were intended.    The town of Zanzibar, situate on the south-western shore of the island,  contains a population of nearly one hundred thousand inhabitants; that  of the island altogether I would estimate at not more than two hundred  thousand inhabitants, including all races.    The greatest number of foreign vessels trading with this port are  American, principally from New York and Salem. After the American come  the German, then come the French and English. They arrive loaded with  American sheeting, brandy, gunpowder, muskets, beads, English cottons,  brass-wire, china-ware, and other notions, and depart with ivory,  gum-copal, cloves, hides, cowries, sesamum, pepper, and cocoa-nut oil.    The value of the exports from this port is estimated at $3,000,000, and  the imports from all countries at $3,500,000.    The Europeans and Americans residing in the town of Zanzibar are either  Government officials, independent merchants, or agents for a few great  mercantile houses in Europe and America.    The climate of Zanzibar is not the most agreeable in the world. I have  heard Americans and Europeans condemn it most heartily. I have also seen  nearly one-half of the white colony laid up in one day from sickness. A  noxious malaria is exhaled from the shallow inlet of Malagash, and the  undrained filth, the garbage, offal, dead mollusks, dead pariah dogs,  dead cats, all species of carrion, remains of men and beasts unburied,  assist to make Zanzibar a most unhealthy city; and considering that it  it ought to be most healthy, nature having pointed out to man the means,  and having assisted him so far, it is most wonderful that the ruling  prince does not obey the dictates of reason.    The bay of Zanzibar is in the form of a crescent, and on the  south-western horn of it is built the city. On the east Zanzibar is  bounded almost entirely by the Malagash Lagoon, an inlet of the sea. It  penetrates to at least two hundred and fifty yards of the sea behind  or south of Shangani Point. Were these two hundred and fifty yards cut  through by a ten foot ditch, and the inlet deepened slightly, Zanzibar  would become an island of itself, and what wonders would it not effect  as to health and salubrity! I have never heard this suggestion made, but  it struck me that the foreign consuls resident at Zanzibar might suggest  this work to the Sultan, and so get the credit of having made it as  healthy a place to live in as any near the equator. But apropos of this,  I remember what Capt. Webb, the American Consul, told me on my first  arrival, when I expressed to him my wonder at the apathy and inertness  of men born with the indomitable energy which characterises Europeans  and Americans, of men imbued with the progressive and stirring instincts  of the white people, who yet allow themselves to dwindle into pallid  phantoms of their kind, into hypochondriacal invalids, into hopeless  believers in the deadliness of the climate, with hardly a trace of that  daring and invincible spirit which rules the world.    \"Oh,\" said Capt. Webb, \"it is all very well for you to talk about energy  and all that kind of thing, but I assure you that a residence of four or  five years on this island, among such people as are here, would make you  feel that it was a hopeless task to resist the influence of the example  by which the most energetic spirits are subdued, and to which they must  submit in time, sooner or later. We were all terribly energetic when we  first came here, and struggled bravely to make things go on as we were  accustomed to have them at home, but we have found that we were  knocking our heads against granite walls to no purpose whatever. These  fellows--the Arabs, the Banyans, and the Hindis--you can't make them go  faster by ever so much scolding and praying, and in a very short time  you see the folly of fighting"]]]
