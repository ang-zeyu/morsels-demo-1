[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4792"],[0,"In Freedom's Cause : A Story of Wallace and Bruce (#3)"],[1,"y, on the 17th of November last, 1292--the  date will long be remembered in Scotland--Edward's judgment  was given at Berwick, and by it John Baliol was declared King of  Scotland.    \"Thus for eighteen months Scotland was kept in doubt; and this was  done, no doubt, to enable the English to rivet their yoke upon our  shoulders, and to intimidate and coerce all who might oppose it.\"    \"There were some that did oppose it, mother, were there not?--some  true Scotchmen who refused to own the supremacy of the King of  England?\"    \"Very few, Archie. One Sir Malcolm Wallace, a knight of but small  estate, refused to do so, and was, together with his eldest son,  slain in an encounter with an English detachment under a leader  named Fenwick at Loudon Hill.\"    \"And was he the father of that William Wallace of whom the talk was  lately that he had slain young Selbye, son of the English governor  of Dundee?\"    \"The same, Archie.\"    \"Men say, mother, that although but eighteen years of age he is of  great stature and strength, of very handsome presence, and courteous  and gentle; and that he was going quietly through the streets when  insulted by young Selbye, and that he and his companions being set  upon by the English soldiers, slew several and made their escape.\"    \"So they say, Archie. He appears from all description of him  to be a remarkable young man, and I trust that he will escape the  vengeance of the English, and that some day he may again strike  some blows for our poor Scotland, which, though nominally under  the rule of Baliol, is now but a province of England.\"    \"But surely, mother, Scotchmen will never remain in such a state  of shameful servitude!\"    \"I trust not, my son; but I fear that it will be long before we  shake off the English yoke. Our nobles are for the most part of  Norman blood; very many are barons of England; and so great are the  jealousies among them that no general effort against England will  be possible. No, if Scotland is ever to be freed, it will be by  a mighty rising of the common people, and even then the struggle  between the commons of Scotland and the whole force of England aided  by the feudal power of all the great Scotch nobles, would be well  nigh hopeless.\"    This conversation sank deeply into Archie's mind; day and night  he thought of nothing but the lost freedom of Scotland, and vowed  that even the hope of regaining his father's lands should be  secondary to that of freeing his country. All sorts of wild dreams  did the boy turn over in his mind; he was no longer gay and light  hearted, but walked about moody and thoughtful. He redoubled his  assiduity in the practice of arms; and sometimes when fighting with  Sandy, he would think that he had an English man-at-arms before him,  and would strike so hotly and fiercely that Sandy had the greatest  difficulty in parrying his blows, and was forced to shout lustily  to recall him from the clouds. He no longer played at ball with the  village lads; but, taking the elder of them aside, he swore them  to secrecy, and then formed them into a band, which he called the  Scottish Avengers. With them he would retire into valleys far away  from the village, where none would mark what they were doing, and  there they practised with club and stake instead of broadsword  and pike, defended narrow passes against an imaginary enemy, and,  divided into two parties, did battle with each other.    The lads entered into the new diversion with spirit.  Among the  lower class throughout Scotland the feeling of indignation at the  manner in which their nobles had sold their country to England was  deep and passionate. They knew the woes which English domination  had brought upon Wales and Ireland; and though as yet without a  leader, and at present hopeless of a successful rising, every true  Scotchman was looking forward to the time when an attempt might be  made to throw off the English yoke.    Therefore the lads of Glen Cairn entered heart and soul into  the projects of their \"young chief,\" for so they regarded Archie,  and strove their best to acquire some of the knowledge of the use  of sword and pike which he possessed. The younger lads were not  permitted to know what was going on--none younger than Archie  himself being admitted into the band, while some of the elders were  youths approaching man's estate. Even to his mother Archie did not  breathe a word of what he was doing, for he feared that she might  forbid his proceedings. The good lady was often surprised at the  cuts and bruises with which he returned home; but he always turned  off her questions by muttering something about rough play or a  heavy fall, and so for some months the existence of the Scottish  Avengers remained unsuspected.        Chapter II    Leaving Home      One day when \"the Avengers\" were engaged in mimic battle in a glen  some two miles from the village they were startled with a loud  shout of \"How now, what is this uproar?\" Bows were lowered and  hedge stakes dropped; on the hillside stood Red Roy, the henchman  of Sir John Kerr, with another of the retainers. They had been  crossing the hills, and had been attracted by the sound of shouting.  All the lads were aware of the necessity for Archie's avoiding the  notice of the Kerrs, and Andrew Macpherson, one of the eldest of  the lads, at once stepped forward:  \"We are playing,\" he said, \"at  fighting Picts against Scots.\"    This was the case, for the English were so hated that Archie had  found that none would even in sport take that name, and the sides  were accordingly dubbed Scots and Picts, the latter title not being  so repugnant, and the companies changing sides each day.    \"It looks as if you were fighting in earnest,\" Roy said grimly,  \"for the blood is streaming down your face.\"    \"Oh, we don't mind a hard knock now and again,\" Andrew said  carelessly. \"I suppose, one of these days, we shall have to go out  under Sir John's banner, and the more hard knocks we have now, the  less we shall care for them then.\"    \"That is so,\" Roy said; \"and some of you will soon be able to handle  arms in earnest. Who are your leaders?\" he asked sharply, as his  eye fixed on Archie, who had seated himself carelessly upon a rock  at some little distance.    \"William Orr generally heads one side, and I the other.\"    \"And what does that young Forbes do?\" Red Roy asked.    \"Well, he generally looks on,\" Andrew replied in a confidential  tone; \"he is not much good with the bow, and his lady mother does  not like it if he goes home with a crack across the face, and I  don't think he likes it himself; he is but a poor creature when it  comes to a tussle.\"    \"And it is well for him that he is,\" Red Roy muttered to himself;  \"for if he had been likely to turn out a lad of spirit, Sir John  would have said the word to me before now; but, seeing what he is,  he may as well be left alone for the present.  He will never cause  trouble.\" So saying, Red Roy strolled away with his companion, and  left the lads to continue their mimic fight.    News travelled slowly to Glen Cairn; indeed, it was only when  a travelling chapman or pedlar passed through, or when one of the  villagers went over to Lanark or Glasgow, carrying the fowls and  other produce of the community to market, that the news came from  without.    Baliol was not long before he discovered that his monarchy was but  a nominal one. The first quarrel which arose between him and his  imperious master was concerning the action of the courts. King Edward  directed that there should be an appeal to the courts at Westminster  from all judgments in the Scottish courts. Baliol protested that it  was specifically agreed by the Treaty of Brigham that no Scotchman  was liable to be called upon to plead outside the kingdom; but  Edward openly declared, \"Notwithstanding any concessions made before  Baliol became king, he considered himself at liberty to judge in  any case brought before him from Scotland, and would, if necessary,  summon the King of Scots himself to appear in his presence.\" He  then compelled Baliol formally to renounce and cancel not only the  Treaty of Brigham, but every stipulation of the kind \"known to  exist, or which might be thereafter discovered.\" Another appeal  followed, and Baliol was cited to appear personally, but refused;  he was thereupon declared contumacious by the English parliament,  and a resolution was passed that three of the principal towns of  Scotland should be \"seized,\" until he gave satisfaction. All this  was a manifest usurpation, even allowing Edward's claims to supremacy  to be well founded.    At this moment Edward became involved in a quarrel with his own  lord superior Phillip, king of France, by whom he was in turned  summoned to appear under the pain of contumacy. Edward met this  demand by a renunciation of allegiance to Phillip and a declaration  of war, and called upon Baliol for aid as his vassal; but Baliol  was also a vassal of the French king, and had estates in France  liable to seizure. He therefore hesitated. Edward further ordered  him to lay an embargo upon all vessels in the ports of Scotland,  and required the attendance of many of the Scottish barons in his  expedition to France. Finding his orders disobeyed, on the 16th  of October Edward issued a writ to the sheriff of Northampton,  \"to seize all lands, goods, and chattels of John Baliol and other  Scots.\"    The Scotch held a parliament at Scone. All Englishmen holding office  were summarily dismissed. A committee of the estates was appointed  to act as guardian of the kingdom, and Baliol himself was deprived  of all active power; but an instrument was prepared in his name,  reciting the injuries that he and his subjects had sustained at the  hands of the English king, and renouncing all further allegiance.  Following this up, a league was concluded, offensive and defensive,  between the French king and Scotland, represented by the prelates,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48"],[0,"The 1992 CIA World Factbook (#3)"],[1," per capita $820; real growth      rate --35% (1991 est.)

Algeria      depends on hydrocarbons for nearly all of its export receipts, about 30% of      government revenues, and nearly 25% of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in      oil prices led to a booming economy and helped to finance an ambitious      program of industrialization. Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the      mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized economy, has brought the      nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since independence in      1988. The government has promised far-reaching reforms, including      privatization of some public- sector companies, encouraging private-sector      activity, boosting gas and nonhydrocarbon exports, and proposing a major      overhaul of the banking and financial systems, but to date it has made only      limited progress.
