The other turned savagely upon him.  They had a rapid altercation, in  which they fastened upon each other various strange epithets.    The youth at last interrupted them.  \"Did you ever think you might run  yourself, Jim?\" he asked.  On concluding the sentence he laughed as if  he had meant to aim a joke.  The loud soldier also giggled.    The tall private waved his hand.  \"Well,\" said he profoundly, \"I've  thought it might get too hot for Jim Conklin in some of them  scrimmages, and if a whole lot of boys started and run, why, I s'pose  I'd start and run.  And if I once started to run, I'd run like the  devil, and no mistake.  But if everybody was a-standing and a-fighting,  why, I'd stand and fight.  Be jiminey, I would.  I'll bet on it.\"    \"Huh!\" said the loud one.    The youth of this tale felt gratitude for these words of his comrade.  He had feared that all of the untried men possessed great and correct  confidence.  He now was in a measure reassured.          Chapter 2      The next morning the youth discovered that his tall comrade had been  the fast-flying messenger of a mistake.  There was much scoffing at the  latter by those who had yesterday been firm adherents of his views, and  there was even a little sneering by men who had never believed the  rumor.  The tall one fought with a man from Chatfield Corners and beat  him severely.    The youth felt, however, that his problem was in no wise lifted from  him.  There was, on the contrary, an irritating prolongation.  The tale  had created in him a great concern for himself.  Now, with the newborn  question in his mind, he was compelled to sink back into his old place  as part of a blue demonstration.    For days he made ceaseless calculations, but they were all wondrously  unsatisfactory.  He found that he could establish nothing.  He finally  concluded that the only way to prove himself was to go into the blaze,  and then figuratively to watch his legs to discover their merits and  faults.  He reluctantly admitted that he could not sit still and with a  mental slate and pencil derive an answer.  To gain it, he must have  blaze, blood, and danger, even as a chemist requires this, that, and  the other.  So he fretted for an opportunity.    Meanwhile, he continually tried to measure himself by his comrades.  The tall soldier, for one, gave him some assurance.  This man's serene  unconcern dealt him a measure of confidence, for he had known him since  childhood, and from his intimate knowledge he did not see how he could  be capable of anything that was beyond him, the youth.  Still, he  thought that his comrade might be mistaken about himself.  Or, on the  other hand, he might be a man heretofore doomed to peace and obscurity,  but, in reality, made to shine in war.    The youth would have liked to have discovered another who suspected  himself.  A sympathetic comparison of mental notes would have been a  joy to him.    He occasionally tried to fathom a comrade with seductive sentences.  He  looked about to find men in the proper mood.  All attempts failed to  bring forth any statement which looked in any way like a confession to  those doubts which he privately acknowledged in himself.  He was afraid  to make an open declaration of his concern, because he dreaded to place  some unscrupulous confidant upon the high plane of the unconfessed from  which elevation he could be derided.    In regard to his companions his mind wavered between two opinions,  according to his mood.  Sometimes he inclined to believing them all  heroes.  In fact, he usually admired in secret the superior development  of the higher qualities in others.  He could conceive of men going very  insignificantly about the world bearing a load of courage unseen, and  although he had known many of his comrades through boyhood, he began to  fear that his judgment of them had been blind.  Then, in other moments,  he flouted these theories, and assured him that his fellows were all  privately wondering and quaking.    His emotions made him feel strange in the presence of men who talked  excitedly of a prospective battle as of a drama they were about to  witness, with nothing but eagerness and curiosity apparent in their  faces.  It was often that he suspected them to be liars.    He did not pass such thoughts without severe condemnation of himself.  He dinned reproaches at times.  He was convicted by himself of many  shameful crimes against the gods of traditions.    In his great anxiety his heart was continually clamoring at what he  considered the intolerable slowness of the generals.  They seemed  content to perch tranquilly on the river bank, and leave him bowed down  by the weight of a great problem.  He wanted it settled forthwith.  He  could not long bear such a load, he said. Sometimes his anger at the  commanders reached an acute stage, and he grumbled about the camp like  a veteran.    One morning, however, he found himself in the ranks of his prepared  regiment.  The men were whispering speculations and recounting the old  rumors.  In the gloom before the break of the day their uniforms glowed  a deep purple hue.  From across the river the red eyes were still  peering.  In the eastern sky there was a yellow patch like a rug laid  for the feet of the coming sun; and against it, black and patternlike,  loomed the gigantic figure of the colonel on a gigantic horse.    From off in the darkness came the trampling of feet.  The youth could  occasionally see dark shadows that moved like monsters.  The regiment  stood at rest for what seemed a long time.  The youth grew impatient.  It was unendurable the way these affairs were managed.  He wondered how  long they were to be kept waiting.    As he looked all about him and pondered upon the mystic gloom, he began  to believe that at any moment the ominous distance might be aflare, and  the rolling crashes of an engagement come to his ears.  Staring once at  the red eyes across the river, he conceived them to be growing larger,  as the orbs of a row of dragons advancing.  He turned toward the  colonel and saw him lift his gigantic arm and calmly stroke his  mustache.    At last he heard from along the road at the foot of the hill the  clatter of a horse's galloping hoofs.  It must be the coming of orders.  He bent forward, scarce breathing.  The exciting clickety-click, as it  grew louder and louder, seemed to be beating upon his soul.  Presently  a horseman with jangling equipment drew rein before the colonel of the  regiment.  The two held a short, sharp-worded conversation.  The men in  the foremost ranks craned their necks.    As the horseman wheeled his animal and galloped away he turned to shout  over his shoulder, \"Don't forget that box of cigars!\" The colonel  mumbled in reply.  The youth wondered what a box of cigars had to do  with war.    A moment later the regiment went swinging off into the darkness.  It  was now like one of those moving monsters wending with many feet.  The  air was heavy, and cold with dew.  A mass of wet grass, marched upon,  rustled like silk.    There was an occasional flash and glimmer of steel from the backs of  all these huge crawling reptiles.  From the road came creakings and  grumblings as some surly guns were dragged away.    The men stumbled along still muttering speculations.  There was a  subdued debate.  Once a man fell down, and as he reached for his rifle  a comrade, unseeing, trod upon his hand.  He of the injured fingers  swore bitterly, and aloud.  A low, tittering laugh went among his  fellows.    Presently they passed into a roadway and marched forward with easy  strides.  A dark regiment moved before them, and from behind also came  the tinkle of equipments on the bodies of marching men.    The rushing yellow of the developing day went on behind their backs.  When the sunrays at last struck full and mellowingly upon the earth,  the youth saw that the landscape was streaked with two long, thin,  black columns which disappeared on the brow of a hill in front and  rearward vanished in a wood.  They were like two serpents crawling from  the cavern of the night.    The river was not in view.  The tall soldier burst into praises of what  he thought to be his powers of perception.    Some of the tall one's companions cried with emphasis that they, too,  had evolved the same thing, and they congratulated themselves upon it.  But there were others who said that the tall one's plan was not the  true one at all.  They persisted  with other theories.  There was a  vigorous discussion.    The youth took no part in them.  As he walked along in careless line he  was engaged with his own eternal debate.  He could not hinder himself  from dwelling upon it.  He was despondent and sullen, and threw  shifting glances about him.  He looked ahead, often expecting to hear  from the advance the rattle of firing.    But the long serpents crawled slowly from hill to hill without bluster  of smoke.  A dun-colored cloud of dust floated away to the right.  The  sky overhead was of a fairy blue.    The youth studied the faces of his companions, ever on the watch to  detect kindred emotions.  He suffered disappointment.  Some ardor of  the air which was causing the veteran commands to move with  glee--almost with song--had infected the new regiment.  The men began  to speak of victory as of a thing they knew.  Also, the tall soldier  received his vindication.  They were certainly going to come around in  behind the enemy.  They expressed commiseration for that part of the  army which had been left upon the river bank, felicitating themselves  upon being a part of a blasting host.    The youth, considering himself as separated from the others, was  saddened by the blithe and merry speeches that went"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7300"],[0,"Woman and the Republic (#3)"],[1,"ilosophers, brought them open political influence, but not  a hint of voting power or of office-holding.    For the sake of brevity, I will confine my reference to Roman custom to a  single pregnant sentence from Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Empire.\"  He says: \"In every age and country the wiser, or at least the stronger of  the two sexes, has usurped the powers of the state, and confined the other  to the cares and pleasures of domestic life. In hereditary monarchies,  however, and especially in those of modern Europe, the gallant spirit of  chivalry, and the law of succession, have accustomed us to allow a  singular exception, and a woman is often acknowledged the absolute  sovereign of a great kingdom, in which she would be deemed incapable of  exercising the smallest employment, civil or military. But, as the Roman  Emperors were still considered as the generals and magistrates of the  Republic, their wives and mothers, although dignified by the name of  Augusta, were never associated to their personal honors; and a female  reign would have appeared an inexplicable prodigy in the eyes of those  primitive Romans, who married without love, or loved without delicacy or  respect.\"    The warlike states named republics in the Middle Ages had no woman Doge,  or Duke, although women rose to the semblance of political power with  empires and kingdoms, in Italy and Spain as well as in Germany and France,  Austria and Russia.    Let us turn to modern Europe, in which thrones have been occupied now and  again by queens. The progress of woman here, especially in Anglo-Saxon  countries, has been steady, true and inspiring. In the earliest recorded  councils of the race from which we sprang, we see freemen in full armor  casting equal votes. During the ages of feudalism, women who were land-  owners had the same rights as other nobles. They could raise soldiery,  coin money, and administer justice in both civil and criminal proceedings.  In proportion as the aristocratic power lost its hold, women were exempted  from these services and gained in moral influence. The Germanic races were  renowned for their respect for woman, and their love for home. As  constitutional liberty grew, and each Englishman's house became his castle  for defence against arbitrary power, the protection was not for himself  but for his family. A figure-head ruler in feminine attire sits on  England's throne to-day--the England that still unites its church and  state, and in which feudal customs still prevail to some extent. Widows  and spinsters who are property-owners can vote for all offices except the  one charged under the Constitution with the framing and execution of the  laws of the land. Aristocracy decrees that in the House of Lords the  Bishops shall have a voice; but in the House of Commons no clergyman can  hold a seat, and for members of Parliament no woman votes. Would any  Suffragist hold that a clergyman was the inferior of men who do sit in the  House of Commons? They are excluded for the same reason that woman has not  the parliamentary vote--they are looked upon as non-combatants.    The Greek and Roman republics appear to have followed an instinct that was  unerring in the condition of society when they removed women from the  seats of power as the commonwealth gathered strength. Gibbon, in the  sentences quoted, attributes the fact that queens as well as kings have  occupied the thrones of modern Europe to the chivalry of men toward those  who would yet be incapable of exercising actual power except for the  backing of a standing army, or an hereditary nobility sworn to their  support, both of which are composed solely of men. If this be true, it  should be visible in the workings of the constitutional restrictions upon  monarchies that have developed in the past fifty years, during which the  principle of democratic government has advanced with enormous strides over  a great portion of the globe.    In the Austro-Hungarian monarchy there is restricted woman suffrage. The  kingdom of Italy has restricted municipal woman suffrage. The little  republic that separates those countries, the land of Tell and the Vaudois,  has direct manhood suffrage only.    Sweden and Norway are apparently parting company. Sweden chooses to keep  its king and its aristocracy, and it has restricted woman suffrage; but  Norway, which is working toward free institutions, and last year voted to  remove the insignia of union from the Norwegian flag, has no woman  suffrage. [Footnote: In the city of Berne, Switzerland, in 1852, a proxy  vote was given to independent women who paid a commercial tax, but they  made no effort to use it until 1885, when contending political factions  compelled them to do so in a measure. Norway's women have a local school  vote. Both these cases of exception serve to prove the rule that I am  trying to set forth.]    Autocratic Russia and its Asiatic colonies have more woman suffrage than  England. Finland, a constitutional monarchy, was ceded to the Emperor of  Russia in 1809. Women there have all except the parliamentary suffrage.  The Governor-General of the Senate is nominated by the Emperor, and is  chief of the military force. The National Assembly is convoked by the  Emperor whenever he sees fit. The duties of that Assembly are to consider  laws proposed by the Emperor and elaborated by the Committee of Affairs  and four members nominated by the Emperor, who sit in St. Petersburg. The  Emperor has the veto power over any act of theirs. That National Assembly  consists of representatives of the nobility, the clergy, the burghers, and  the peasantry, the consent of all of whom must be obtained to any measure  that makes a change in the constitution or imposes taxes. But the royal  veto can set aside any decision.    Iceland, a dependency of Denmark, has municipal woman suffrage, and women  are eligible to municipal office. It has its own legislature, which  governs jointly with the King, the executive power being in the hands of  the King alone.    In the great extensions of suffrage in England in 1848, an amendment for  the extension of suffrage to women was introduced in Parliament by Mr.  Disraeli. Lord Northcote, Lord John Manners, and other conservatives,  upheld it; but the liberal leaders opposed it, Gladstone and John Bright  among them. John Blight's family were strenuous for the movement, and he  had fancied himself its friend until the issue came; then the old champion  of freedom, proved true to the instinct that guards it in the nation. In  the constantly increasing liberty of the lower classes of England, an  essential principle which excludes women from the parliamentary vote has  been maintained. Lady Spencer Churchill and other Suffrage leaders look to  Viscount Templeton and Lord Salisbury for support to-day.    A woman-suffrage bill of many years' standing and absurd provisions, has  just passed to a second reading in the House of Commons. Although it was  treated as a joke by all parties, it served to emphasize the fact that Sir  Vernon Harcourt and the Liberals are opposed to any advance in this  direction.    In the late extension of suffrage in Canada, the movement for woman  suffrage had conservative support, while every liberal leader opposed it.  No South American Republic has woman suffrage. With the deposition of  Liliuokalani, woman's directs political power in the Hawaiian Islands  died. In France only the Anarchists \"admit women\" to public council, and  that party in Germany has here and there inscribed woman suffrage upon its  banners.    Not only England, Scotland and Wales, but Canada, definitely excepts the  vote for members of parliament in giving suffrage to woman, and only  widows and spinsters are admitted to the minor forms of franchise. As to  the other British colonies, what is the situation? Much stress has been  laid on what has been termed the progress of the Suffrage movement in  Australasia. There is but one Australian colony in which the legislative  assembly is elected; in the others it is appointed for life, or for short  terms. Where it is thus appointed, women vote on various matters. In  Victoria, which contains the capital city, Melbourne, and which is the  most progressive and democratic colony in Australia, the Legislative  Assembly is elected, and that body is chosen by unrestricted male suffrage  only, while, as with the House of Commons in the mother country, clergymen  are not allowed to sit in it. In West Australia, the newest colony, the  voting is done by men alone. In Cape Colony women have restricted  municipal suffrage; but the Assembly is elected by the vote of men who own  a certain amount of property.    In the Orange Free State every adult white male is a full burgher, having  a vote for the President, who is chosen for five years. The Transvaal  Republic has no woman suffrage amid its hand-to-hand struggles.    To comprehend the condition of European governmental affairs, one must  follow the condition of things produced by the struggle of socialistic and  anarchistic elements. Between the King on the one hand, and these forces  on the other, the true Liberal parties are slowly progressing toward free  institutions; both aristocratic and anarchistic movements being more  favorable than liberalism to woman-suffrage aspirations.    The countries where woman has full suffrage (save in the United States)  are all dependencies of royalty. They are: The Isle of Man, Pitcairn's  Island, New Zealand, and South Australia. The most important of these, New  Zealand, was once a promising colony, but it has been declining for a  quarter of a century. The men outnumber the women by forty thousand. The  act conferring the parliamentary franchise on both European and Maori  women received the royal sanction in 1892. At the session of Parliament  that passed the act a tax was put upon incomes and one upon land, so that  a desperate civilization seemed to be"]]]
