You said  that I was dependent upon you.\"    \"So you are.\"    \"And that I wasn't even entitled to the name of Brent.\"    \"Yes, I said it, and it's true.\"    \"Well,\" said Phil, \"I don't want to be dependent upon you. I prefer to  earn my own living.\"    \"I am not prepared to say but that you are right. But do you know what  the neighbors will say?\"    \"What will they say?\"    \"That I drove you from home.\"    \"It won't be true. I don't pretend to enjoy my home, but I suppose I can  stay on here if I like?\"    \"Yes, you can stay.\"    \"You don't object to my going?\"    \"No, if it is understood that you go of your own accord.\"    \"I am willing enough to take the blame of it, if there is any blame.\"    \"Very well; get a sheet of note-paper, and write at my direction.\"    Phil took a sheet of note-paper from his father's desk, and sat down to  comply with Mrs. Brent's request.    She dictated as follows:    \"I leave home at my own wish, but with the consent of Mrs. Brent,  to seek my fortune. It is wholly my own idea, and I hold no one else  responsible.    \"PHILIP BRENT.\"      \"You may as well keep the name of Brent,\" said his step-mother, \"as you  have no other that you know of.\"    Phil winced at those cold words. It was not pleasant to reflect that  this was so, and that he was wholly ignorant of his parentage.    \"One thing more,\" said Mrs. Brent. \"It is only eight o'clock. I should  like to have you go out and call upon some of those with whom you are  most intimate, and tell them that you are leaving home voluntarily.\"    \"I will,\" answered Phil.    \"Perhaps you would prefer to do so to-morrow.\"    \"No; I am going away to-morrow morning.\"    \"Very well.\"    \"Going away to-morrow morning?\" repeated Jonas, who entered the room at  that moment.    Phil's plan was briefly disclosed.    \"Then give me your skates,\" said Jonas.    \"I can't. I've given them to Tommy Kavanagh.\"    \"That's mean. You might have thought of me first,\" grumbled Jonas.    \"I don't know why. Tommy Kavanagh is my friend and you are not.\"    \"Anyway, you can let me have your boat and gun.\"    \"I have sold them.\"    \"That's too bad.\"    \"I don't know why you should expect them. I needed the money they  brought me to pay my expenses till I get work.\"    \"I will pay your expenses to New York if you wish,\" said Mrs. Brent.    \"Thank you; but I shall have money enough,\" answered Phil, who shrank  from receiving any favor at the hands of Mrs. Brent.    \"As you please, but you will do me the justice to remember that I  offered it.\"    \"Thank you. I shall not forget it.\"    That evening, just before going to bed, Mrs. Brent opened a trunk and  drew from it a folded paper.    She read as follows--for it was her husband's will:      \"To the boy generally known as Philip Brent, and supposed, though  incorrectly, to be my son, I bequeath the sum of five thousand dollars,  and direct the same to be paid over to any one whom he may select  as guardian, to hold in trust for him till he attains the age of  twenty-one.\"      \"He need never know of this,\" said Mrs. Brent to herself in a low tone.  \"I will save it for Jonas.\"    She held the paper a moment, as if undecided whether to destroy it, but  finally put it carefully back in the secret hiding-place from which she  had taken it.    \"He is leaving home of his own accord,\" she whispered. \"Henceforth he  will probably keep away. That suits me well, but no one can say I drove  him to it.\"        CHAPTER IV.    MR. LIONEL LAKE.    Six months before it might have cost Philip a pang to leave home. Then  his father was living, and from him the boy had never received aught but  kindness. Even his step-mother, though she secretly disliked him, did  not venture to show it, and secure in the affections of his supposed  father, he did not trouble himself as to whether Mrs. Brent liked him  or not. As for Jonas, he was cautioned by his mother not to get himself  into trouble by treating Phil badly, and the boy, who knew on which side  his interests lay, faithfully obeyed. It was only after the death of Mr.  Brent that both Jonas and his mother changed their course, and thought  it safe to snub Philip.    Planktown was seventy-five miles distant from New York, and the fare was  two dollars and a quarter.    This was rather a large sum to pay, considering Phil's scanty fund, but  he wished to get to the great city as soon as possible, and he decided  that it would be actually cheaper to ride than to walk, considering that  he would have to buy his meals on the way.    He took his seat in the cars, placing a valise full of underclothes on  the seat next him. The train was not very full, and the seat beside him  did not appear to be required.    Mile after mile they sped on the way, and Phil looked from the window  with interest at the towns through which they passed. There are very few  boys of his age--sixteen--who do not like to travel in the cars. Limited  as were his means, and uncertain as were his prospects, Phil felt not  only cheerful, but actually buoyant, as every minute took him farther  away from Planktown, and so nearer the city where he hoped to make a  living at the outset, and perhaps his fortune in the end.    Presently--perhaps half way on--a young man, rather stylishly dressed,  came into the car. It was not at a station, and therefore it seemed  clear that he came from another car.    He halted when he reached the seat which Phil occupied.    Our hero, observing that his glance rested on his valise, politely  removed it, saying:    \"Would you like to sit down here, sir?\"    \"Yes, thank you,\" answered the young man, and sank into the seat beside  Phil.    \"Sorry to inconvenience you,\" he said, with a glance at the bag.    \"Oh, not at all,\" returned Phil. \"I only put the valise on the seat till  it was wanted by some passenger.\"    \"You are more considerate than some passengers,\" observed the young man.  \"In the next car is a woman, an elderly party, who is taking up three  extra seats to accommodate her bags and boxes.\"    \"That seems rather selfish,\" remarked Phil.    \"Selfish! I should say so. I paused a minute at her seat as I passed  along, and she was terribly afraid I wanted to sit down. She didn't  offer to move anything, though, as you have. I stopped long enough to  make her feel uncomfortable, and then passed on. I don't think I have  fared any the worse for doing so. I would rather sit beside you than  her.\"    \"Am I to consider that a compliment?\" asked Phil, smiling.    \"Well, yes, if you choose. Not that it is saying much to call you more  agreeable company than the old party alluded to. Are you going to New  York?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Live there?\"    \"I expect to live there.\"    \"Brought up in the country, perhaps?\"    \"Yes, in Planktown.\"    \"Oh, Planktown! I've heard it's a nice place, but never visited it. Got  any folks?\"    Phil hesitated. In the light of the revelation that had been made to him  by Mrs. Brent, he did not know how to answer. However, there was no call  to answer definitely.    \"Not many,\" he said.    \"Goin' to school in New York?\"    \"No.\"    \"To college, perhaps. I've got a cousin in Columbia College.\"    \"I wish I knew enough to go to college,\" said Phil; \"but I only know a  little Latin, and no Greek at all.\"    \"Well, I never cared much about Latin or Greek, myself. I presume you  are thinking about a business position?\"    \"Yes, I shall try to get a place.\"    \"You may find a little time necessary to find one. However, you are, no  doubt, able to pay your board for awhile.\"    \"For a short time,\" said Phil.    \"Well, I may be able to help you to a place. I know a good many  prominent business men.\"    \"I should be grateful to you for any help of that kind,\" said Phil,  deciding that he was in luck to meet with such a friend.    \"Don't mention it. I have had to struggle myself--in earlier  days--though at present I am well fixed. What is your name?\"    \"Philip Brent.\"    \"Good! My name is Lionel Lake. Sorry I haven't got any cards. Perhaps I  may have one in my pocket-book. Let me see!\"    Mr. Lake opened his porte-monnaie and uttered a exclamation of surprise.    \"By Jove!\" he said, \"I am in a fix.\"    Phil looked at him inquiringly.    \"I took out a roll of bills at the house of my aunt, where I stayed last  night,\" explained Mr. Lake, \"and must have neglected to replace them.\"    \"I hope you have not lost them,\" said Phil politely.    \"Oh, no; my aunt will find them and take care of them for me, so that I  shall get them back. The trouble is that I am left temporarily without  funds.\"    \"But you can get money in the city,\" suggested Phil.    \"No doubt; only it is necessary for me to stay over a train ten miles  short of the city.\"    Mr. Lionel Lake seemed very much perplexed.    \"If I knew some one in the cars,\" he said reflectively.    It did occur to Phil to offer to loan him something, but the scantiness  of his own resources warned him that it would not be prudent, so he  remained silent.    Finally Mr. Lake appeared to have an idea.    \"Have you got five dollars, Philip?\" he said familiarly.    \"Yes, sir,\" answered Philip slowly.    \"Then I'll make a proposal. Lend it to me and I will give you this ring  as security. It is worth twenty-five dollars easily.\"    He drew from his vest-pocket a neat gold ring, with some sort of a stone  in the setting.    \"There!\" said Mr. Lake, \"I'll give you this ring and my address, and you  can bring it to my office to-morrow morning. I'll give you back the  five dollars and one dollar for the accommodation. That's good interest,  isn't it?\"    \"But I might keep the ring and sell it,\" suggested Phil.    \"Oh, I am not afraid. You look honest. I will trust you,\" said the young  man, in a careless, off-hand manner. \"Say, is it a bargain?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Phil.    It occurred to him that he could not earn a dollar more easily. Besides,  he would be doing a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46202"],[0,"A New Witness for God (Volume 1 of 3) (#3)"],[1,"for the extension of Christianity; and wherever  he was successful, he demolished the temples and images of the gods,  the altars and groves, and commanded the Christian worship to be set  up. * * * The Fins who infested Sweden with frequent inroads, were  attacked by Eric IX., King of Sweden, called St. Eric, after his death,  and by him subdued after many bloody battles. * * * The vanquished  nation was commanded to follow the religion of the conqueror, which  most of them did with reluctance and disgust.\"    \"Towards the close of the century [the tenth], * * * some merchants of  Bremen or of Lubec trading to Livonia, took along with them Mainhard, a  regular canon of St. Augustine in the monastery of Segberg in Halsatia,  to bring that warlike and uncivilized nation to the Christian faith.  But as few listened to him, Mainhard consulted the Roman pontiff,  who created him the first bishop of the Livonians, and desired that  war should be waged against the opposers. This war, which was first  waged with the Esthonians, was extended farther and prosecuted more  rigorously by Berthold, the second bishop of the Livonians, after the  death of Mainhard; for this, Berthold, formerly Abbot of Lucca, marched  with a strong army from Saxony, and recommended Christianity not by  arguments but by slaughter and battle. Following his example, the third  bishop, Albert, previously a canon of Bremen, entering Livonia in the  year 1198, well supported by a fresh army raised in Saxony, and fixing  his camp at Riga, he instituted, by authority of Innocent III., the  Roman pontiff, the military order of knight's sword-bearers, who should  compel the Livonians by force of arms to submit to baptism. New forces  were marched from time to time from Germany, by whose valor and that of  the sword-bearers the wretched people were subdued and exhausted, so  that they at last substituted the images of Christ and the saints in  place of their idols.\" [7]    A volume of evidence similar in import to the foregoing could be  compiled, showing that from the accession of Constantine the Great down  to the sixteenth century, the Roman Catholic Church did not hesitate to  employ the civil power to enforce conversion and punish recalcitrants.    If the Eastern Church has been less successful in extending the borders  of Christianity by means of conquests waged by the civil power, it was  because the division of the world it occupied afforded less opportunity  than Western Europe, where a great struggle was on between the race of  men made weak by the effete civilization of Rome and the more vigorous  barbarians. But while the Eastern Church made less direct use of the  sword to extend its dominions, it nevertheless had the state for an ally  which sustained it at need.    When in the sixteenth century the great revolt against the authority  of the pope and the religion of the Roman Catholic Church gave birth  to the Protestant churches, they, too, in the main, formed alliances  with the states in which they were founded. Nay, in the very struggle  for their existence, the states of Germany, of Holland, Scandinavia  and of England, drew the sword in their behalf and by their support  made it possible for the seceding religionists to establish churches  despite all efforts of the Roman pontiffs to prevent them; and after  the revolution was an accomplished fact, the states above enumerated  continued to give support to the churches founded within their borders.  If the church and the state in some instances were regarded as separate  and distinct societies, they acted at the same time as close neighbors,  and nearly interested in each other's welfare. If they lived separate,  they were not estranged; and each at need gave the other support.    I have thought it necessary to call the attention of the reader to  the conditions in which Christianity has existed since the days of  Constantine under all three great divisions of Christendom--the  Roman Catholic, the Greek Catholic, and Protestant--in order that  he might be reminded of the fact that circumstances of the most  propitious character have existed for the propagation of the so-called  Christian religion. Christendom has had at its command the wealth  and intelligence of Europe; it has been able to follow the commerce  of European states into every country of the world; and not only its  commerce, but its conquests as well; and wherever the love of adventure  or the desire for conquest has led Christian soldiers, Christian  priests have either accompanied or followed them, that the gospel, in  the hands of the Christian minister, might be a balm for the wounds  inflicted by the sword in the hands of the Christian soldier; so that  if Christian armies were a bane to the savages, the Christian priests  might be an antidote!    Yet with all the advantages which came to Christianity through the  support of the state; with the intelligence and wealth of Europe behind  it; with the privilege of following in the wake of its commerce and  conquests; what has Christendom done in the way of converting the world  to its religion? But a little over one-fourth of the inhabitants of the  earth are even nominally Christian! There are in the world, according  to statistics published on the subject:      Roman Catholics ...........................206,588,206      Protestants (all sects) ................... 89,825,348      Greek and Russian Churches ................ 75,691,382      Oriental Churches ......................... 6,770,000      Making the total of all Christians........ 378,874,936.      The other religions stand as follows:      Brahminical Hindoos .......................120,000,000      Followers of Buddha, Shinto and    Confucius .................................482,600,000      Mohammedans ...............................169,054,789      Jews ....................................... 7,612,784      Parsees (fire-worshipers in Persia) ........ 1,000,000      Pagans not otherwise enumerated ...........277,000,000                                             ______________      Making a total of .......................1,007,267,573 [8]    Surely when the superior advantages for the propagation of the  Christian religion are taken into account, one could reasonably expect  better results than this, after a period of nineteen centuries, sixteen  of which may be said to have been of a character favorable to the  extension of the borders of the church.    But let us take a nearer view of the status of Christendom. As seen in  the foregoing, but a little more than one-fourth of the population of  the earth is even nominally Christian. No one will contend that all  those nominally Christians are really Christians. Church membership  may be one thing, conversion to the Christian religion quite another.  If those who are Christians in name only, and church members from  custom or for worldly advantage were separated from those who are  Christians upon principle, upon conversion and real faith, the number  of Christians in the world would be materially reduced. For it cannot  be denied that when any religion becomes popular there are multitudes  of insincere men who will outwardly accept it, and give it lip-service  in return for the advantages that accrue to them socially, financially  or politically.    Moreover, Christendom is not united in one great body or church; but  on the contrary it is divided into numerous contending factions whose  differences are so far fundamental that there appears no prospect of  reconciliation among them. The Catholics refuse to recognize any power  of salvation in Protestantism. To the Catholic the Protestant is an  heretic, a renegade child; and on the other hand, to the Protestant,  the Catholic is an idolator, and the pope the very anti-Christ,  prophesied of in scripture.    Nor are the Roman and Greek Catholics much nearer at one with each  other than the Roman Catholics and Protestants. Away back in the  ninth century, as a result of the controversy between the Eastern and  Western Churches, Pope Nicholas, in a council held at Rome, solemnly  excommunicated Photius, the patriarch of Jerusalem, and had his  ordination declared null and void. The Greek emperor resented this  conduct of the pope, and under his sanction Photius, in his turn,  convened what he called an acumenical council, in which he pronounced  sentence of excommunication and deposition against the pope, and got it  subscribed by twenty-one bishops and others amounting in number to one  thousand.    Although this breach was patched up after the death of the Emperor  Michael, difficulties broke out again between the East and the West  from time to time, until finally in the eleventh century, when Michael  Cerularius, patriarch of Constantinople, opposed the Western Church  with respect to their making use of unleavened bread in the sacrament,  their observation of the Sabbath, and fasting on Saturdays, charging  therein that they lived in communion with the Jews. Pope Leo IX.  replied, and in his apology for the Western Churches, declaimed warmly  against the false doctrine of the Greeks, and ended by placing on  the altar of Santa Sophia, by his legates, a deed of excommunication  against the Patriarch, Michael Cerularius. This was the final rupture.  From that time the mutual hatred of the Greeks and the Latins became  insuperable, insomuch that they have continued ever since separated  from each other's communion. [9]    Though both the Greek and the Protestant Churches are separated  from the Roman Catholic Church, yet there is no union or fellowship  between them; on the contrary, they hold doctrines so opposite that  union between them is out of the question. At least so remote is the  prospect, that all attempts at union have been ineffectual.    Turn now to Protestant Christendom. Surely we shall find a union of  organization and agreement of sentiment here! But no; division, on  the"]]]
