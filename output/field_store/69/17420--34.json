But they met with no sympathy. The proceedings against them  justified their terror. The Bastile was soon unable to contain the  prisoners that were sent to it, and the gaols all over the country  teemed with guilty or suspected persons. An order was issued to all  innkeepers and postmasters to refuse horses to such as endeavoured  to seek safety in flight; and all persons were forbidden, under heavy  fines, to harbour them or favour their evasion. Some were condemned to  the pillory, others to the gallies, and the least guilty to fine  and imprisonment. One only, Samuel Bernard, a rich banker, and  farmer-general of a province remote from the capital, was sentenced to  death. So great had been the illegal profits of this man,--looked  upon as the tyrant and oppressor of his district,--that he offered six  millions of livres, or 250,000 pounds sterling, to be allowed to escape.    His bribe was refused, and he suffered the penalty of death. Others,  perhaps more guilty, were more fortunate. Confiscation, owing to the  concealment of their treasures by the delinquents, often produced less  money than a fine. The severity of the government relaxed, and fines,  under the denomination of taxes, were indiscriminately levied upon all  offenders. But so corrupt was every department of the administration,  that the country benefited but little by the sums which thus flowed into  the treasury. Courtiers, and courtiers' wives and mistresses, came in  for the chief share of the spoils. One contractor had been taxed in  proportion to his wealth and guilt, at the sum of twelve millions of  livres. The Count * * *, a man of some weight in the government, called  upon him, and offered to procure a remission of the fine, if he would  give him a hundred thousand crowns. \"Vous etes trop tard, mon ami,\"  replied the financier; \"I have already made a bargain with your wife for  fifty thousand.\" [This anecdote is related by M. de la Hode, in his Life  of Philippe of Orleans. It would have looked more authentic if he had  given the names of the dishonest contractor and the still more dishonest  minister. But M. de la Hode's book is liable to the same objection as  most of the French memoirs of that and of subsequent periods. It is  sufficient with most of them that an anecdote be ben trovato; the veto  is but matter of secondary consideration.]    About a hundred and eighty millions of livres were levied in this  manner, of which eighty were applied in payment of the debts contracted  by the government. The remainder found its way into the pockets of the  courtiers. Madame de Maintenon, writing on this subject, says, \"We hear  every day of some new grant of the Regent; the people murmur very much  at this mode of employing the money taken from the peculators.\"  The people, who, after the first burst of their resentment is over,  generally express a sympathy for the weak, were indignant that so much  severity should be used to so little purpose. They did not see the  justice of robbing one set of rogues to fatten another. In a few months  all the more guilty had been brought to punishment, and the chamber of  justice looked for victims in humbler walks of life. Charges of fraud  and extortion were brought against tradesmen of good character, in  consequence of the great inducements held out to common informers. They  were compelled to lay open their affairs before this tribunal in order  to establish their innocence. The voice of complaint resounded from  every side, and at the expiration of a year the government found it  advisable to discontinue further proceedings. The chamber of justice was  suppressed, and a general amnesty granted to all against whom no charges  had yet been preferred.    In the midst of this financial confusion Law appeared upon the scene.  No man felt more deeply than the Regent the deplorable state of the  country, but no man could be more averse from putting his shoulders  manfully to the wheel. He disliked business; he signed official  documents without proper examination, and trusted to others what he  should have undertaken himself. The cares inseparable from his high  office were burdensome to him; he saw that something was necessary to  be done, but he lacked the energy to do it, and had not virtue enough  to sacrifice his case and his pleasures in the attempt. No wonder that,  with this character, he listened favourably to the mighty projects, so  easy of execution, of the clever adventurer whom he had formerly known,  and whose talents he appreciated.    When Law presented himself at court, he was most cordially received.  He offered two memorials to the Regent, in which he set forth the  evils that had befallen France, owing to an insufficient currency,  at different times depreciated. He asserted that a metallic currency,  unaided by a paper money, was wholly inadequate to the wants of a  commercial country, and particularly cited the examples of Great  Britain and Holland to show the advantages of paper. He used many  sound arguments on the subject of credit, and proposed, as a means of  restoring that of France, then at so low an ebb among the nations, that  he should be allowed to set up a bank, which should have the management  of the royal revenues, and issue notes, both on that and on landed  security. He further proposed that this bank should be administered  in the King's name, but subject to the control of commissioners, to be  named by the States-General.    While these memorials were under consideration, Law translated into  French his essay on money and trade, and used every means to extend  through the nation his renown as a financier. He soon became talked of.  The confidants of the Regent spread abroad his praise, and every one  expected great things of Monsieur Lass. [The French pronounced his name  in this manner to avoid the ungallic sound, aw. After the failure of his  scheme, the wags said the nation was lasse de lui, and proposed that he  should in future be known by the name of Monsieur Helas!]    On the 5th of May, 1716, a royal edict was published, by which Law was  authorised, in conjunction with his brother, to establish a bank, under  the name of Law and Company, the notes of which should be received in  payment of the taxes. The capital was fixed at six millions of livres,  in twelve thousand shares of five hundred livres each, purchasable  one-fourth in specie and the remainder in billets d'etat. It was not  thought expedient to grant him the whole of the privileges prayed for  in his memorials until experience should have shown their safety and  advantage.    Law was now on the high road to fortune. The study of thirty years was  brought to guide him in the management of his bank. He made all his  notes payable at sight, and in the coin current at the time they  were issued. This last was a master-stroke of policy, and immediately  rendered his notes more valuable than the precious metals. The latter  were constantly liable to depreciation by the unwise tampering of the  government. A thousand livres of silver might be worth their nominal  value one day and be reduced one-sixth the next, but a note of Law's  bank retained its original value. He publicly declared at the same time  that a banker deserved death if he made issues without having sufficient  security to answer all demands. The consequence was, that his notes  advanced rapidly in public estimation, and were received at one per  cent. more than specie. It was not long before the trade of the country  felt the benefit. Languishing commerce began to lift up her head; the  taxes were paid with greater regularity and less murmuring, and a degree  of confidence was established that could not fail, if it continued, to  become still more advantageous. In the course of a year Law's notes rose  to fifteen per cent. premium, while the billets d'etat, or notes  issued by the government, as security for the debts contracted by the  extravagant Louis XIV, were at a discount of no less than seventy-eight  and a half per cent. The comparison was too great in favour of Law not  to attract the attention of the whole kingdom, and his credit extended  itself day by day. Branches of his bank were almost simultaneously  established at Lyons, Rochelle, Tours, Amiens, and Orleans.    The Regent appears to have been utterly astonished at his success, and  gradually to have conceived the idea, that paper, which could so aid a  metallic currency, could entirely supersede it. Upon this fundamental  error he afterwards acted. In the mean time, Law commenced the famous  project which has handed his name down to posterity. He proposed to  the Regent, who could refuse him nothing, to establish a company,  that should have the exclusive privilege of trading to the great river  Mississippi and the province of Louisiana, on its western bank. The  country was supposed to abound in the precious metals, and the company,  supported by the profits of their exclusive commerce, were to be the  sole farmers of the taxes, and sole coiners of money. Letters patent  were issued, incorporating the company, in August 1717. The capital was  divided into two hundred thousand shares of five hundred livres each,  the whole of which might be paid in billets d'etat, at their nominal  value, although worth no more than 160 livres in the market.    It was now that the frenzy of speculating began to seize upon the  nation. Law's bank had effected so much good, that any promises for the  future which he thought proper to make were readily believed. The Regent  every day conferred new privileges upon the fortunate projector. The  bank obtained the monopoly of the sale of tobacco; the sole right of  refinage of gold and silver, and was finally erected into the Royal Bank  of France. Amid the intoxication of success, both Law and the Regent  forgot the maxim so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6382"],[0,"Bat Wing (#3)"],[1,"and stared at the  speaker silently for a moment. \"Voodoo?\" he echoed. \"You mean negro  magic?\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"My studies have certainly not embraced it,\" replied Harley, quietly,  \"nor has it hitherto come within my experience. But since I have lived  much in the East, I am prepared to learn that Voodoo may not be a  negligible quantity. There are forces at work in India which we in  England improperly understand. The same may be true of Cuba.\"    \"The same _is_ true of Cuba.\"    Colonel Menendez glared almost fiercely across the room at Paul Harley.    \"And do I understand,\" asked the latter, \"that the danger which you  believe to threaten you is associated with Cuba?\"    \"That, Mr. Harley, is for you to decide when all the facts shall be in  your possession. Do you wish that I proceed?\"    \"By all means. I must confess that I am intensely interested.\"    \"Very well, Mr. Harley. I have something to show you.\"    From an inside breast pocket Colonel Menendez drew out a gold-mounted  case, and from the case took some flat, irregularly shaped object  wrapped in a piece of tissue paper. Unfolding the paper, he strode  across and laid the object which it had contained upon the blotting pad  in front of my friend.    Impelled by curiosity I stood up and advanced to inspect it. It was of  a dirty brown colour, some five or six inches long, and appeared to  consist of a kind of membrane. Harley, his elbow on the table, was  staring down at it questioningly.    \"What is it?\" I said; \"some kind of leaf?\"    \"No,\" replied Harley, looking up into the dark face of the Spanish  colonel; \"I think I know what it is.\"    \"I, also, know what it is.\" declared Colonel Menendez, grimly. \"But tell  me what to you it seems like, Mr. Harley?\"    Paul Harley's expression was compounded of incredulity, wonder, and  something else, as, continuing to stare at the speaker, he replied:    \"It is the wing of a bat.\"          CHAPTER II    THE VOODOO SWAMP        Often enough my memory has recaptured that moment in Paul Harley's  office, when Harley, myself, and the tall Spaniard stood looking down at  the bat wing lying upon the blotting pad.    My brilliant friend at times displayed a sort of prescience, of which  I may have occasion to speak later, but I, together with the rest of  pur-blind humanity, am commonly immune from the prophetic instinct.  Therefore I chronicle the fact for what it may be worth, that as I gazed  with a sort of disgust at the exhibit lying upon the table I became  possessed of a conviction, which had no logical basis, that a door had  been opened through which I should step into a new avenue of being; I  felt myself to stand upon the threshold of things strange and terrible,  but withal alluring. Perhaps it is true that in the great crises of life  the inner eye becomes momentarily opened.    With intense curiosity I awaited the Colonel's next words, but, a  cigarette held nervously between his fingers, he stood staring at  Harley, and it was the latter who broke that peculiar silence which had  fallen upon us.    \"The wing of a bat,\" he murmured, then touched it gingerly. \"Of what  kind of bat, Colonel Menendez? Surely not a British species?\"    \"But emphatically not a British species,\" replied the Spaniard. \"Yet  even so the matter would be strange.\"    \"I am all anxiety to learn the remainder of your story, Colonel  Menendez.\"    \"Good. Your interest comforts me very greatly, Mr. Harley. But when  first I came, you led me to suppose that you were departing from  London?\"    \"Such, at the time, was my intention, sir.\" Paul Harley smiled slightly.  \"Accompanied by my friend, Mr. Knox, I had proposed to indulge in a  fortnight's fishing upon the Norfolk Broads.\"    \"Fishing?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"A peaceful occupation, Mr. Harley, and a great rest-cure for one who  like yourself moves much amid the fiercer passions of life. You were  about to make holiday?\"    Paul Harley nodded.    \"It is cruel of me to intrude upon such plans,\" continued Colonel  Menendez, dexterously rolling his cigarette around between his fingers.  \"Yet because of my urgent need I dare to do so. Would yourself and your  friend honour me with your company at Cray's Folly for a few days? I  can promise you good entertainment, although I regret that there is no  fishing; but it may chance that there will be other and more exciting  sport.\"    Harley glanced at me significantly.    \"Do I understand you to mean, Colonel Menendez,\" he asked, \"that you  have reason to believe that this conspiracy directed against you is  about to come to a head?\"    Colonel Menendez nodded, at the same time bringing his hand down sharply  upon the table.    \"Mr. Harley,\" he replied, his high, thin voice sunken almost to a  whisper, \"Wednesday night is the night of the full moon.\"    \"The full moon?\"    \"It is at the full moon that the danger comes.\"    Paul Harley stood up, and watched by the Spanish colonel paced slowly  across the office. At the outer door he paused and turned.    \"Colonel Menendez,\" he said, \"that you would willingly waste the time of  a busy man I do not for a moment believe, therefore I shall ask you as  briefly as possible to state your case in detail. When I have heard it,  if it appears to me that any good purpose can be served by my friend  and myself coming to Cray's Folly I feel sure that he will be happy to  accept your proffered hospitality.\"    \"If I am likely to be of the slightest use I shall be delighted,\" said  I, which indeed was perfectly true.    Whilst I had willingly agreed to accompany Harley to Norfolk I had  none of his passion for the piscatorial art, and the promise of novel  excitement held out by Colonel Menendez appealed to me more keenly than  the lazy days upon the roads which Harley loved.    \"Gentlemen\"--the Colonel bowed profoundly--\"I am honoured and delighted.  When you shall have heard my story I know what your decision will be.\"    He resumed his seat, and began, it seemed almost automatically, to roll  a fresh cigarette.    \"I am all attention,\" declared Harley, and his glance strayed again in a  wondering fashion to the bat wing lying on his table.    \"I will speak briefly,\" resumed our visitor, \"and any details which  may seem to you to be important can be discussed later when you are  my guests. You must know then that I first became acquainted with the  significance belonging to the term 'Bat Wing' and to the object itself  some twenty years ago.\"    \"But surely,\" interrupted Harley, incredulously, \"you are not going  to tell me that the menace of which you complain is of twenty years'  standing?\"    \"At your express request, Mr. Harley,\" returned the Colonel a trifle  brusquely, \"I am dealing with possibilities which are remote, because  in your own words it is sometimes the remote which proves to be the  intimate. It was then rather more than twenty years ago, at a time when  great political changes were taking place in the West Indies, that my  business interests, which are mainly concerned with sugar, carried me  to one of the smaller islands which had formerly been under--my  jurisdiction, do you say? Here I had a house and estate, and here in the  past I had experienced much trouble with the natives.    \"I do not disguise from you that I was unpopular, and on my return I  met with unmistakable signs of hostility. My native workmen were  insubordinate. In fact, it was the reports from my overseers which had  led me to visit the island. I made a tour of the place, believing it to  be necessary to my interests that I should get once more in touch  with negro feeling, since I had returned to my home in Cuba after the  upheavals in '98. Very well.    \"The manager of my estate, a capable man, was of opinion that  there existed a secret organization amongst the native labourers  operating--you understand?--against my interests. He produced certain  evidences of this. They were not convincing; and all my enquiries and  examinations of certain inhabitants led to no definite results. Yet I  grew more and more to feel that enemies surrounded me.\"    He paused to light his third cigarette, and whilst he did so I conjured  up a mental picture of his \"examinations of certain inhabitants.\" I  recalled hazily those stories of Spanish mismanagement and cruelty which  had directly led to United States interferences in the islands. But  whilst I could well believe that this man's life had not been safe in  those bad old days in the West Indies, I found it difficult to suppose  that a native plot against his safety could have survived for more than  twenty years and have come to a climax in England. However, I realized  that there was more to follow, and presently, having lighted his  cigarette, the Colonel resumed:    \"In the neighbourhood of the hacienda which had once been my official  residence there was a belt of low-lying pest country--you understand  pest country?--which was a hot-bed of poisonous diseases. It followed  the winding course of a nearly stagnant creek. From the earliest  times the Black Belt--it was so called--had been avoided by European  inhabitants, and indeed by the coloured population as well. Apart from  the malaria of the swampy ground it was infested with reptiles and with  poisonous insects of a greater variety and of a more venomous character  than I have ever known in any part of the world.    \"I must explain that what I regarded as a weak point in my manager's  theory was this: Whilst he held that the native labourers to a man were  linked together under some head, or guiding influence, he had never  succeeded in surprising anything in the nature of a negro meeting.  Indeed, he had prohibited all gatherings of this kind. His answer to  my criticism was a curious one. He declared that the members of this  mysterious society met and received their instructions at some place  within the poison area to which I have referred, believing themselves  there to be safe from European"]]]
