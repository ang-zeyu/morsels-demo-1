[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6762"],[0,"Politics: A Treatise on Government (#3)"],[1,"otle's analysis of existing constitutions,  we find that while he regards them as imperfect approximations to the  ideal, he also thinks of them as the result of the struggle between  classes. Democracy, he explains, is the government not of the many but  of the poor; oligarchy a government not of the few but of the rich.  And each class is thought of, not as trying to express an ideal, but as  struggling to acquire power or maintain its position. If ever the class  existed in unredeemed nakedness, it was in the Greek cities of the  fourth century, and its existence is abundantly recognised by Aristotle.  His account of the causes of revolutions in Book V. shows how far were  the existing states of Greece from the ideal with which he starts.  His analysis of the facts forces him to look upon them as the scene  of struggling factions. The causes of revolutions are not described as  primarily changes in the conception of the common good, but changes in  the military or economic power of the several classes in the state. The  aim which he sets before oligarchs or democracies is not the good life,  but simple stability or permanence of the existing constitution.    With this spirit of realism which pervades Books IV., V., and VI.  the idealism of Books I., II., VII., and VIII. is never reconciled.  Aristotle is content to call existing constitutions perversions of  the true form. But we cannot read the Politics without recognising  and profiting from the insight into the nature of the state which is  revealed throughout. Aristotle's failure does not lie in this, that he  is both idealist and realist, but that he keeps these two tendencies  too far apart. He thinks too much of his ideal state, as something to  be reached once for all by knowledge, as a fixed type to which actual  states approximate or from which they are perversions. But if we are to  think of actual politics as intelligible in the light of the ideal, we  must think of that ideal as progressively revealed in history, not as  something to be discovered by turning our back on experience and having  recourse to abstract reasoning. If we stretch forward from what exists  to an ideal, it is to a better which may be in its turn transcended, not  to a single immutable best. Aristotle found in the society of his  time men who were not capable of political reflection, and who, as he  thought, did their best work under superintendence. He therefore called  them natural slaves. For, according to Aristotle, that is a man's  natural condition in which he does his best work. But Aristotle also  thinks of nature as something fixed and immutable; and therefore  sanctions the institution of slavery, which assumes that what men are  that they will always be, and sets up an artificial barrier to their  ever becoming anything else. We see in Aristotle's defence of slavery  how the conception of nature as the ideal can have a debasing influence  upon views of practical politics. His high ideal of citizenship offers  to those who can satisfy its claims the prospect of a fair life;  those who fall short are deemed to be different in nature and shut out  entirely from approach to the ideal.

A TREATISE ON GOVERNMENT          BOOK I          CHAPTER I      As we see that every city is a society, and every society Ed. is  established for some good purpose; for an apparent [Bekker 1252a] good  is the spring of all human actions; it is evident that this is the  principle upon which they are every one founded, and this is more  especially true of that which has for its object the best possible, and  is itself the most excellent, and comprehends all the rest. Now this is  called a city, and the society thereof a political society; for those  who think that the principles of a political, a regal, a family, and  a herile government are the same are mistaken, while they suppose that  each of these differ in the numbers to whom their power extends, but  not in their constitution: so that with them a herile government is one  composed of a very few, a domestic of more, a civil and a regal of still  more, as if there was no difference between a large family and a small  city, or that a regal government and a political one are the same, only  that in the one a single person is continually at the head of public  affairs; in the other, that each member of the state has in his turn a  share in the government, and is at one time a magistrate, at another  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6763"],[0,"Aristotle on the art of poetry (#3)"],[1," to the heart of things.    Characteristic, too, is the observation that different kinds of art grow  and develop, but not indefinitely; they develop until they 'attain their  natural form'; also the rule that each form of art should produce 'not  every sort of pleasure but its proper pleasure'; and the sober language  in which Aristotle, instead of speaking about the sequence of events  in a tragedy being 'inevitable', as we bombastic moderns do, merely  recommends that they should be 'either necessary or probable' and  'appear to happen because of one another'.    Conceptions and attitudes of mind such as these constitute what we may  call the classical faith in matters of art and poetry; a faith which is  never perhaps fully accepted in any age, yet, unlike others, is never  forgotten but lives by being constantly criticized, re-asserted, and  rebelled against. For the fashions of the ages vary in this direction  and that, but they vary for the most part from a central road which was  struck out by the imagination of Greece.    G. M            ARISTOTLE ON THE ART OF POETRY          1      Our subject being Poetry, I propose to speak not only of the art in  general but also of its species and their respective capacities; of the  structure of plot required for a good poem; of the number and nature of  the constituent parts of a poem; and likewise of any other matters in  the same line of inquiry. Let us follow the natural order and begin with  the primary facts.    Epic poetry and Tragedy, as also Comedy, Dithyrambic poetry, and most  flute-playing and lyre-playing, are all, viewed as a whole, modes of  imitation. But at the same time they differ from one another in three  ways, either by a difference of kind in their means, or by differences  in the objects, or in the manner of their imitations.    I. Just as form and colour are used as means by some, who (whether by  art or constant practice) imitate and portray many things by their aid,  and the voice is used by others; so also in the above-mentioned group  of arts, the means with them as a whole are rhythm, language, and  harmony--used, however, either singly or in certain combinations. A  combination of rhythm and harmony alone is the means in flute-playing  and lyre-playing, and any other arts there may be of the same  description, e.g. imitative piping. Rhythm alone, without harmony, is  the means in the dancer's imitations; for even he, by the rhythms of his  attitudes, may represent men's characters, as well as what they do  and suffer. There is further an art which imitates by language alone,  without harmony, in prose or in verse, and if in verse, either in some  one or in a plurality of metres. This form of imitation is to this  day without a name. We have no common name for a mime of Sophron or  Xenarchus and a Socratic Conversation; and we should still be without  one even if the imitation in the two instances were in trimeters or  elegiacs or some other kind of verse--though it is the way with people  to tack on 'poet' to the name of a metre, and talk of elegiac-poets  and epic-poets, thinking that they call them poets not by reason of the  imitative nature of their work, but indiscriminately by reason of the  metre they write in. Even if a theory of medicine or physical philosophy  be put forth in a metrical form, it is usual to describe the writer in  this way; Homer and Empedocles, however, have really nothing in common  apart from their metre; so that, if the one is to be called a poet, the  other should be termed a physicist rather than a poet. We should be in  the same position also, if the imitation in these instances were in all  the metres, like the _Centaur_ (a rhapsody in a medley of all metres) of  Chaeremon; and Chaeremon one has to recognize as a poet. So much, then,  as to these arts. There are, lastly, certain other arts, which combine  all the means enumerated, rhythm, melody, and verse, e.g. Dithyrambic  and Nomic poetry, Tragedy and Comedy; with this difference, however,  that the three kinds of means are in some of them all employed together,  and in others brought in separately, one after the other. These elements  of difference in the above arts I term the means of their imitation.          2      II. The objects the imitator represents are actions, with agents who are  necessarily either good men or bad--the diversities of human character  being nearly always derivative from this primary distinction, since the  line between virtue and vice is one dividing the whole of mankind. It  follows, therefore, that the agents represented must be either above our  own level of goodness, or beneath it, or just such as we are in the same  way as, with the painters, the personages of Polygnotus are better  than we are, those of Pauson worse, and those of Dionysius just like  ourselves. It is clear that each of the above-mentioned arts will  admit of these differences, and that it will become a separate art by  representing objects with this point of difference. Even in dancing,  flute-playing, and lyre-playing such diversities are possible; and they  are also possible in the nameless art that uses language, prose or verse  without harmony, as its means; Homer's personages, for instance, are  better than we are; Cleophon's are on our own level; and those of  Hegemon of Thasos, the first writer of parodies, and Nicochares,  the author of the _Diliad_, are beneath it. The same is true of the  Dithyramb and the Nome: the personages may be presented in them with the  difference exemplified in the... of... and Argas, and in the Cyclopses  of Timotheus and Philoxenus. This difference it is that distinguishes  Tragedy and Comedy also; the one would make its personages worse, and  the other better, than the men of the present day.          3      III. A third difference in these arts is in the manner in which each  kind of object is represented. Given both the same means and the same  kind of object for imitation, one may either (1) speak at one moment in  narrative and at another in an assumed character, as Homer does; or (2)  one may remain the same throughout, without any such change; or (3) the  imitators may represent the whole story dramatically, as though they  were actually doing the things described.    As we said at the beginning, therefore, the differences in the imitation  of these arts come under three heads, their means, their objects, and  their manner.    So that as an imitator Sophocles will be on one side akin to Homer, both  portraying good men; and on another to Aristophanes, since both present  their personages as acting and doing. This in fact, according to some,  is the reason for plays being termed dramas, because in a play the  personages act the story. Hence too both Tragedy and Comedy are claimed  by the Dorians as their discoveries; Comedy by the Megarians--by those  in Greece as having arisen when Megara became a democracy, and by the  Sicilian Megarians on the ground that the poet Epicharmus was of their  country, and a good deal earlier than Chionides and Magnes; even Tragedy  also is claimed by certain of the Peloponnesian Dorians. In support of  this claim they point to the words 'comedy' and 'drama'. Their word for  the outlying hamlets, they say, is comae, whereas Athenians call them  demes--thus assuming that comedians got the name not from their _comoe_  or revels, but from their strolling from hamlet to hamlet, lack of  appreciation keeping them out of the city. Their word also for 'to act',  they say, is _dran_, whereas Athenians use _prattein_.    So much, then, as to the number and nature of the points of difference  in the imitation of these arts.          4      It is clear that the general origin of poetry was due to two causes,  each of them part of human nature. Imitation is natural to man from  childhood, one of his advantages over the lower animals being this, that  he is the most imitative creature in the world, and learns at first  by imitation. And it is also natural for all to delight in works of  imitation. The truth of this second point is shown by experience: though  the objects themselves may be painful to see, we delight to view the  most realistic representations of them in art, the forms for example of  the lowest animals and of dead bodies. The explanation is to be found  in a further fact: to be learning something is the greatest of pleasures  not only to the philosopher but also to the rest of mankind, however  small their capacity for it; the reason of the delight in seeing the  picture is that one is at the same time learning--gathering the meaning  of things, e.g. that the man there is so-and-so; for if one has not  seen the thing before, one's pleasure will not be in the picture as an  imitation of it, but will be due to the execution or colouring or some  similar cause. Imitation, then, being natural to us--as also the sense  of harmony and rhythm, the metres being obviously species of rhythms--it  was through their original aptitude, and by a series of improvements for  the most part gradual on their first efforts, that they created poetry  out of their improvisations.    Poetry, however, soon broke up into two kinds according to the  differences of character in the individual poets; for the graver among  them would represent noble actions, and those of noble personages; and  the meaner sort the actions of the ignoble. The latter class produced  invectives at first, just as others did hymns and panegyrics. We know of  no such poem by any of the pre-Homeric poets, though there were probably  many such writers among them; instances, however, may be found from  Homer downwards, e.g. his _Margites_, and the similar poems of others.  In this poetry of invective its natural fitness brought an iambic metre  into use; hence our present term 'iambic', because it was the metre of  their 'iambs' or invectives against one another. The result was that  the old poets became some of them"]]]
