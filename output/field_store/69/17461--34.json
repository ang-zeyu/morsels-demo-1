[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7234"],[0,"Species and Varieties, Their Origin (#3)"],[1," is now universally accepted as the chief law of nature  in the organic world. In honor of him, who with unsurpassed genius, and  by unlimited labor has made it the basis of modern thought, this law is  called the \"Darwinian theory of descent.\"    Darwin's second contribution to this attainment was his proof of the  possibility of a physiological explanation of the process of descent  itself. Of this possibility he fully convinced his contemporaries, but  in indicating the particular means by which the change of species has  been brought about, he has not succeeded in securing universal  acceptation. Quite on the contrary, objections have been raised from the  very outset, and with such force as to compel Darwin himself to change  his views in his later writings. This however, was of no avail, and  objections and criticisms have since steadily accumulated. Physiologic  facts concerning the origin of [5] species in nature were unknown in the  time of Darwin. It was a happy idea to choose the experience of the  breeders in the production of new varieties, as a basis on which to  build an explanation of the processes of nature. In my opinion Darwin  was quite right, and he has succeeded in giving the desired proof. But  the basis was a frail one, and would not stand too close an examination.  Of this Darwin was always well aware. He has been prudent to the utmost,  leaving many points undecided, and among them especially the range of  validity of his several arguments. Unfortunately this prudence has not  been adopted by his followers. Without sufficient warrant they have laid  stress on one phase of the problem, quite overlooking the others.  Wallace has even gone so far in his zeal and ardent veneration for  Darwin, as to describe as Darwinism some things, which in my opinion,  had never been a part of Darwin's conceptions.    The experience of the breeders was quite inadequate to the use which  Darwin made of it. It was neither scientific, nor critically accurate.  Laws of variation were barely conjectured; the different types of  variability were only imperfectly distinguished. The breeders'  conception was fairly sufficient for practical purposes, but science  needed a clear understanding of the [6] factors in the general process  of variation. Repeatedly Darwin tried to formulate these causes, but the  evidence available did not meet his requirements.    Quetelet's law of variation had not yet been published. Mendel's claim  of hereditary units for the explanation of certain laws of hybrids  discovered by him, was not yet made. The clear distinction between  spontaneous and sudden changes, as compared with the ever-present  fluctuating variations, is only of late coming into recognition by  agriculturists. Innumerable minor points which go to elucidate the  breeders' experience, and with which we are now quite familiar, were  unknown in Darwin's time. No wonder that he made mistakes, and laid  stress on modes of descent, which have since been proved to be of minor  importance or even of doubtful validity.    Notwithstanding all these apparently unsurmountable difficulties, Darwin  discovered the great principle which rules the evolution of organisms.  It is the principle of natural selection. It is the sifting out of all  organisms of minor worth through the struggle for life. It is only a  sieve, and not a force of nature, not a direct cause of improvement, as  many of Darwin's adversaries, and unfortunately many of his followers  also, have so often asserted.    It is [7] only a sieve, which decides what is to live, and what is to  die. But evolutionary lines are of great length, and the evolution of a  flower, or of an insectivorous plant is a way with many sidepaths. It is  the sieve that keeps evolution on the main line, killing all, or nearly  all that try to go in other directions. By this means natural selection  is the one directing cause of the broad lines of evolution.    Of course, with the single steps of evolution it has nothing to do. Only  after the step has been taken, the sieve acts, eliminating the unfit.  The problem, as to the manner in which the individual steps are brought  about, is quite another side of the question.    On this point Darwin has recognized two possibilities. One means of  change lies in the sudden and spontaneous production of new forms from  the old stock. The other method is the gradual accumulation of those  always present and ever fluctuating variations which are indicated by  the common assertion that no two individuals of a given race are exactly  alike. The first changes are what we now call \"mutations,\" the second  are designated as \"individual variations,\" or as this term is often used  in another sense, as \"fluctuations.\" Darwin recognized both lines of  evolution; Wallace disregarded the sudden changes and proposed  fluctuations [8] as the exclusive factor. Of late, however, this point  of view has been abandoned by many investigators, especially in America.    The actual occurrence of mutations is recognized, and the battle rages  about the question, as to whether they are be regarded as the principal  means of evolution, or whether slow and gradual changes have not also  played a large and important part.    The defenders of the theory of evolution by slow accumulation of slight  fluctuations are divided into two camps. One group is called the  Neo-Lamarckians; they assume a direct modifying agency of the  environment, producing a corresponding and useful change in the  organization. The other group call themselves Darwinians or  selectionists, but to my mind with no other right beyond the arbitrary  restriction of the Darwinian principles by Wallace. They assume  fluctuating variations in all directions and leave the choice between  them to the sieve of natural selection.    Of course we are far from a decision between these views, on the sole  ground of the facts as known at present. Mutations under observation are  as yet very rare; enough to indicate the possible and most probable  ways, but no more. On the other hand the accumulation of fluctuations  does not transgress relatively narrow [9] limits as far as the present  methods of selection go. But the question remains to be solved, whether  our methods are truly the right ones, and whether by the use of new  principles, new results might not cause the balance of opinion to favor  the opposite side.    Of late, a thorough and detailed discussion of the opposing views has  been given by Morgan in his valuable book on evolution and adaptation.  He has subjected all the proposed theories to a severe criticism both on  the ground of facts and on that of their innate possibility and logical  value. He decides in favor of the mutation theory. His arguments are  incisive and complete and wholly adapted to the comprehension of all  intelligent readers, so that his book relieves me entirely of the  necessity of discussing these general questions, as it could not be done  in a better or in a clearer way.    I intend to give a review of the facts obtained from plants which go to  prove the assertion, that species and varieties have originated by  mutation, and are, at present, not known to originate in any other way.  This review consists of two parts. One is a critical survey of the facts  of agricultural and horticultural breeding, as they have accumulated  since the time of Darwin. This body of evidence is to be combined with  some corresponding experiments [10] concerning the real nature of  species in the wild state. The other part rests on my own observations  and experiments, made in the botanical garden of the University of  Amsterdam.    For many years past I have tried to elucidate the hereditary conditions  of species and varieties, and the occasional occurrence of mutations,  that suddenly produce new forms.    The present discussion has a double purpose. On one side it will give  the justification of the theory of mutations, as derived from the facts  now at hand. On the other hand it will point out the deficiencies of  available evidence, and indicate the ways by which the lacunae may  gradually be filled. Experimental work on heredity does not require vast  installments or costly laboratory equipment. It demands chiefly  assiduity and exactitude. Any one who has these two qualities, and who  has a small garden at his disposal is requested to take part in this  line of investigation.    In order to observe directly the birth of new forms it is necessary, in  the first place, to be fully clear concerning the question as to what  forms are to be expected to arise from others, and before proceeding to  a demonstration of the origin of species, it is pertinent to raise the  question as to what constitutes a species.    Species is a word, which always has had a [11] double meaning. One is  the systematic species, which is the unit of our system. But these units  are by no means indivisible. Long ago Linnaeus knew them to be compound  in a great number of instances, and increasing knowledge has shown that  the same rule prevails in other instances. Today the vast majority of  the old systematic species are known to consist of minor units. These  minor entities are called varieties in systematic works. However, there  are many objections to this usage. First, the term variety is applied in  horticulture and agriculture to things so widely divergent as to convey  no clear idea at all. Secondly, the subdivisions of species are by no  means all of the same nature, and the systematic varieties include units  the real value of which is widely different in different cases. Some of  these varieties are in reality as good as species, and have been  \"elevated,\" as it is called by some writers, to this rank. This  conception of the elementary species would be quite justifiable, and  would at once get rid of all difficulties, were it not for one practical  obstacle. The number of the species in all genera would "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7238"],[0,"My Four Years in Germany (#3)"],[1,"higher than in those parts of Germany where they  have their country estates.    The first great court ceremonial is the _Schleppencour_,  so-called from the long trains or _Schleppen_ worn by the  women. On this night we \"presented\" Mr. and Mrs. Robert K. Cassatt  of Philadelphia, Mrs. Ernest Wiltsee, Mrs. and Miss Luce and  Mrs. Norman Whitehouse. On the arrival at the palace with these  and all the members of the Embassy Staff and their wives, we  were shown up a long stair-case, at the top of which a guard of  honour, dressed in costume of the time of Frederick the Great,  presented arms to all Ambassadors, and ruffled kettle-drums.  Through long lines of cadets from the military schools, dressed  as pages, in white, with short breeches and powdered wigs, we  passed through several rooms where all the people to pass in  review were gathered. Behind these, in a room about sixty feet by  fifty, on a throne facing the door were the Emperor and Empress,  and on the broad steps of this throne were the princes and their  wives, the court ladies-in-waiting and all the other members of  the court. The wives of the Ambassadors entered the room first,  followed at intervals of about twenty feet by the ladies of the  Embassy and the ladies to be presented. As they entered the room  and made a change of direction toward the throne, pages in white  straightened out the ladies' trains with long sticks. Arrived  opposite the throne and about twenty feet from it, each Ambassador's  wife made a low curtsey and then stood on the foot of the throne,  to the left of the Emperor and Empress, and as each lady of the  Embassy, not before presented, and each lady to be presented  stopped beside the throne and made a low curtsey, the Ambassadress  had to call out the name of each one in a loud voice; and when  the last one had passed she followed her out of the room, walking  sideways so as not to turn her back on the royalties,--something  of a feat when towing a train about fifteen feet long. When all the  Ambassadresses had so passed, it was the turn of the Ambassadors,  who carried out substantially the same programme, substituting low  bows for curtsies. The Ambassadors were followed by the Ministers'  wives, these by the Ministers and these by the dignitaries of  the German Court. All passed into the adjoining hall, and there  a buffet supper was served. The whole affair began at about eight  o'clock and was over in an hour.    At the court balls, which also began early in the evening, a  different procedure was followed. There the guests were required  to assemble before eight-twenty in the ball-room. As in the  _Schleppencour_, on one side of the room was the throne with  seats for the Emperor and Empress, and to the right of this throne  were the chairs for the Ambassadors' wives who were seated in the  order of their husbands' rank, with the ladies of their Embassy,  and any ladies they had brought to the ball standing behind them.  After them came the Ministers' wives, sitting in similar fashion;  then the Ambassadors, standing with their staffs behind them on  raised steps, with any men that they had asked invitations for,  and the Ministers in similar order. To the left of the throne  stood the wives of the Dukes and dignitaries of Germany and then  their husbands. When all were assembled, promptly at the time  announced, the orchestra, which was dressed in mediæval costume  and sat in a gallery, sounded trumpets and then the Emperor and  Empress entered the room, the Emperor, of course, in uniform,  followed by the ladies and gentlemen of the household all in  brilliant uniforms, and one or two officers of the court regiment,  picked out for their great height and dressed in the kind of  uniform Rupert of Hentzau wears on the stage,--a silver helmet  surmounted by an eagle, a steel breast-plate, white breeches  and coat, and enormous high boots coming half way up the thigh.  The Grand Huntsman wore a white wig, three-cornered hat and a  long green coat.    On entering the room, the Empress usually commenced on one side  and the Emperor on the other, going around the room and speaking  to the Ambassadors' wives and Ambassadors, etc., in turn, and  the Empress in similar fashion, chatting for a moment with the  German dignitaries and their wives lined up on the opposite side  of the room. After going perhaps half way around each side, the  Emperor and Empress would then change sides. This going around  the room and chatting with people in turn is called \"making the  circle\", and young royalties are practised in \"making the circle\"  by being made to go up to the trees in a garden and address a  few pleasant words to each tree, in this manner learning one  of the principal duties of royalty.    The dancing is only by young women and young officers of noble  families who have practised the dances before. They are under  the superintendence of several young officers who are known as  _Vortänzer_ and when anyone in Berlin in court society gives  a ball these _Vortänzer_ are the ones who see that all dancing  is conducted strictly according to rule and manage the affairs  of the ball-room with true Prussian efficiency. Supper is about  ten-thirty at a court ball and is at small tables. Each royalty  has a table holding about eight people and to these people are  invited without particular rule as to precedence. The younger  guests and lower dignitaries are not placed at supper but find  places at tables to suit themselves. After supper all go back  to the ball-room and there the young ladies and officers, led  by the _Vortänzer_ execute a sort of lancers, in the final  figure of which long lines are formed of dancers radiating from  the throne; and all the dancers make bows and curtsies to the  Emperor and Empress who are either standing or sitting at this  time on the throne. At about eleven-thirty the ball is over,  and as the guests pass out through the long hall, they are given  glasses of hot punch and a peculiar sort of local Berlin bun, in  order to ward off the lurking dangers of the villainous winter  climate.    At the court balls the diplomats are, of course, in their best  diplomatic uniform. All Germans are in uniform of some kind, but the  women do not wear the long trains worn at the _Schleppencour_.  They wear ordinary ball dresses. In connection with court dancing  it is rather interesting to note that when the tango and turkey  trot made their way over the frontiers of Germany in the autumn  of 1913, the Emperor issued a special order that no officers of  the army or navy should dance any of these dances or should go  to the house of any person who, at any time, whether officers  were present or not, had allowed any of these new dances to be  danced. This effectually extinguished the turkey trot, the bunny  hug and the tango, and maintained the waltz and the polka in their  old estate. It may seem ridiculous that such a decree should  be so solemnly issued, but I believe that the higher authorities  in Germany earnestly desired that the people, and, especially,  the officers of the army and navy, should learn not to enjoy  themselves too much. A great endeavour was always made to keep  them in a life, so far as possible, of Spartan simplicity. For  instance, the army officers were forbidden to play polo, not  because of anything against the game, which, of course, is splendid  practice for riding, but because it would make a distinction in  the army between rich and poor.    [Illustration: A SALON IN THE AMERICAN EMBASSY.]    [Illustration: THE BALLROOM OF THE EMBASSY. THIS WAS AFTERWARD  TURNED INTO A WORKROOM FOR THE RELIEF OF AMERICANS IN WAR DAYS.]    The Emperor's birthday, January twenty-seventh, is a day of great  celebration. At nine-thirty in the morning the Ambassadors, Ministers  and all the dignitaries of the court attend Divine Service in the  chapel of the palace. On this day in 1914, the Queen of Greece and  many of the reigning princes of the German States were present.  In the evening there was a gala performance in the opera house,  the entire house being occupied by members of the court. Between  the acts in the large foyer, royalties \"made the circle,\" and I  had quite a long conversation with both the Emperor and Empress  and was \"caught\" by the King of Saxony. Many of the Ambassadors  have letters of credence not only to the court at Berlin but  also to the rulers of the minor German States. For instance,  the Belgian Minister was accredited to thirteen countries in  Germany and the Spanish Ambassador to eleven. For some reason  or other, the American and Turkish Ambassadors are accredited  only to the court at Berlin. Some of the German rulers feel this  quite keenly, and the King of Saxony, especially. I had been  warned that he was very anxious to show his resentment of this  distinction by refusing to shake hands with the American Ambassador.  He was in the foyer on the occasion of this gala performance  and said that he would like to have me presented to him. I, of  course, could not refuse, but forgot the warning of my predecessors  and put out my hand, which the King ostentatiously neglected to  take. A few moments later the wife of the Turkish Ambassador was  presented to the King of Saxony and received a similar rebuff;  but, as she was a daughter of the Khedive of Egypt, and therefore  a Royal Highness in her own right, she went around the King of  Saxony, seized his hand, which he had put behind him, brought  it around to the front and shook it warmly, a fine example of  great presence of mind.    Writing of all these things and looking out from a sky-scraper  in New York, these details of court life seem very frivolous  and far away. But an Ambassador is compelled to become part of  this system. The most important conversations with the Emperor  sometimes take place at court functions, and the Ambassador and  his secretaries often gather their most useful bits of"]]]
