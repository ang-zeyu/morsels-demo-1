This accomplished, all the territory left to Florence was a  narrow belt around the walls. Villani even says that for the four years  during which Frederick still lived the Commonwealth was wholly landless.  And here, rather than lose ourselves among the endless treaties,  leagues, and campaigns which fill so many pages of the chronicles, it  may be worth while shortly to glance at the constitution of Florentine  society, and especially at the place held in it by the class which found  its protector in Barbarossa.    Much about the time at which the Commonwealth was relieved of its feudal  trammels, as a result of the favour or the necessities of Matilda, it  was beginning to extend its commerce and increase its industry. Starting  somewhat late on the career on which Venice, Genoa, and Pisa were  already far advanced, Florence was as if strenuous to make up for lost  time, and soon displayed a rare comprehension of the nature of the  enterprise. It may be questioned if ever, until quite modern times,  there has been anywhere so clear an understanding of the truth that  public wellbeing is the sum of private prosperity, or such an  enlightened perception of what tends to economical progress. Florence  had no special command of raw material for her manufactures, no sea-port  of her own, and no monopoly unless in the natural genius of her people.  She could therefore thrive only by dint of holding open her  communications with the world at large, and grudged no pains either of  war or diplomacy to keep at Pisa a free way out and in for her  merchandise. Already in the twelfth century she received through that  port the rough woollens of Flanders, which, after being skilfully  dressed and dyed, were sent out at great profit to every market of  Europe. At a somewhat later period the Florentines were to give as  strong a proof of their financial capacity as this was of their  industrial. It was they who first conducted a large business in bills of  exchange, and who first struck a gold coin which, being kept of  invariable purity, passed current in every land where men bought and  sold--even in countries where the very name of Florence was unknown.[3]    In a community thus devoted to industry and commerce, it was natural  that a great place should be filled by merchants. These were divided  into six guilds, the members of which, with the notaries and lawyers,  who composed a seventh, formed the true body of the citizens.  Originally the consuls of these guilds were the only elected officials  in the city, and in the early days of its liberty they were even charged  with political duties, and are found, for example, signing a treaty of  peace with a neighbouring state. In the fully developed commune it was  only the wealthier citizens--the members, we may assume, of these  guilds--who, along with the nobles,[4] were eligible for and had the  right of electing to the public offices. Below them was the great body  of the people; all, that is, of servile condition or engaged in the  meaner kinds of business. From one point of view, the liberties of the  citizens were only their privileges. But although the labourers and  humbler tradesmen were without franchises, their interests were not  therefore neglected, being bound up with those of the one or two  thousand citizens who shared with the patricians the control of public  affairs.    There were two classes of nobles with whom Florence had to reckon as she  awoke to life--those within the walls, and those settled in the  neighbouring country. In later times it was a favourite boast among the  noble citizens--a boast indulged in by Dante--that they were descended  from ancient Roman settlers on the banks of the Arno. A safer boast  would in many cases have been that their ancestors had come to Italy in  the train of Otho and other conquering Emperors. Though settled in the  city, in some cases for generations, the patrician families were not  altogether of it, being distinguished from the other citizens, if not  always by the possession of ancestral landward estates, at least by  their delight in war and contempt for honest industry. But with the  faults of a noble class they had many of its good qualities. Of these  the Republic suffered them to make full proof, allowing them to lead in  war and hold civil offices out of all proportion to their numbers.    Like the city itself, the nobles in the country around had been feudally  subject to the Marquis of Tuscany. After Matilda's death they claimed to  hold direct from the Empire; which meant in practice to be above all  law. They exercised absolute jurisdiction over their serfs and  dependants, and, when favoured by the situation of their castles, took  toll, like the robber barons of Germany, of the goods which passed  beneath their walls. Already they had proved to be thorns in the side of  the industrious burghers; but at the beginning of the twelfth century  their neighbourhood became intolerable, and for a couple of generations  the chief political work of Florence was to bring them to reason. Those  whose lands came up almost to the city gates were first dealt with, and  then in a widening circle the country was cleared of the pest. Year  after year, when the days were lengthening out in spring, the roughly  organised city militia was mustered, war was declared against some  specially obnoxious noble and his fortress was taken by surprise, or,  failing that, was subjected to a siege. In the absence of a more  definite grievance, it was enough to declare his castle dangerously near  the city. These expeditions were led by the nobles who were already  citizens, while the country neighbours of the victim looked on with  indifference, or even helped to waste the lands or force the stronghold  of a rival. The castle once taken, it was either levelled with the  ground, or was restored to the owner on condition of his yielding  service to the Republic. And, both by way of securing a hold upon an  unwilling vassal and of adding a wealthy house and some strong arms to  the Commonwealth, he was compelled, along with his family, to reside in  Florence for a great part of every year.    With a wider territory and an increasing commerce, it was natural for  Florence to assume more and more the attitude of a sovereign state,  ready, when need was, to impose its will upon its neighbours, or to join  with them for the common defence of Tuscany. In the noble class and its  retainers, recruited as has been described, it was possessed of a  standing army which, whether from love of adventure or greed of plunder,  was never so well pleased as when in active employment. Not that the  commons left the fighting wholly to the men of family, for they too, at  the summons of the war-bell, had to arm for the field; but at the best  they did it from a sense of duty, and, without the aid of professional  men-at-arms, they must have failed more frequently in their enterprises,  or at any rate have had to endure a greatly prolonged absence from their  counters and workshops. And yet, esteem this advantage as highly as we  will, Florence surely lost more than it gained by compelling the crowd  of idle gentlemen to come within its walls. In the course of time some  of them indeed condescended to engage in trade--sank, as the phrase  went, into the ranks of the _Popolani_, or mere wealthy citizens; but  the great body of them, while their landed property was being largely  increased in value in consequence of the general prosperity, held  themselves haughtily aloof from honest industry in every form. Each  family, or rather each clan of them, lived apart in its own group of  houses, from among which towers shot aloft for scores of yards into the  air, dominating the humbler dwellings of the common burghers. These,  whenever they came to the front for a time in the government, were used  to decree that all private towers were to be lopped down to within a  certain distance from the ground.    It is a favourite exercise of Villani and other historians to trace the  troubles and revolutions in the state of Florence to chance quarrels  between noble families, arising from an angry word or a broken troth.  Here, they tell, was sown the seed of the Guelf and Ghibeline wars in  Florence; and here that of the feuds of Black and White. Such quarrels  and party names were symptoms and nothing more. The enduring source of  trouble was the presence within the city of a powerful idle class,  constantly eager to recover the privilege it had lost, and to secure  itself by every available means, including that of outside help, in the  possession of what it still retained; which chafed against the curbs put  upon its lawlessness, and whose ambitions were all opposed to the  general interest. The citizens, for their part, had nothing better to  hope for than that Italy should be left to the Italians, Florence to the  Florentines. On the occasion of the celebrated Buondelmonti feud (1215),  some of the nobles definitely went over to the side of the people,  either because they judged it likely to win in the long-run, or  impelled unconsciously by the forces that in every society divide  ambitious men into two camps, and in one form or another develop party  strife. They who made a profession of popular sympathy did it with a  view of using rather than of helping the people at large. Both of the  noble parties held the same end in sight--control of the Commonwealth;  and this would be worth the more the fewer there were to share it. The  faction irreconcilable with the Republic on any terms included many of  the oldest and proudest houses. Their hope lay in the advent of a strong  Emperor, who should depute to them his rights over the money-getting,  low-born crowd.      II.
