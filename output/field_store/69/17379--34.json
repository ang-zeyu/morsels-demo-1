The participles are likewise omitted, unless, by signifying rather  habit or quality than action, they take the nature of adjectives;  as a thinking man, a man of prudence; a pacing horse, a horse that  can pace: these I have ventured to call participial adjectives.  But neither are these always inserted, because they are commonly  to be understood, without any danger of mistake, by consulting the  verb.    Obsolete words are admitted, when they are found in authours not  obsolete, or when they have any force or beauty that may deserve  revival.    As composition is one of the chief characteristicks of a language,  I have endeavoured to make some reparation for the universal negligence  of my predecessors, by inserting great numbers of compounded words,  as may be found under after, fore, new, night, fair, and many more.  These, numerous as they are, might be multiplied, but that use and  curiosity are here satisfied, and the frame of our language and  modes of our combination amply discovered.    Of some forms of composition, such as that by which re is prefixed  to note repetition, and un to signify contrariety or privation,  all the examples cannot be accumulated, because the use of these  particles, if not wholly arbitrary, is so little limited, that  they are hourly affixed to new words as occasion requires, or is  imagined to require them.    There is another kind of composition more frequent in our language  than perhaps in any other, from which arises to foreigners the  greatest difficulty. We modify the signification of many verbs by  a particle subjoined; as to come off, to escape by a fetch; to fall  on, to attack; to fall off, to apostatize; to break off, to stop  abruptly; to bear out, to justify; to fall in, to comply; to give  over, to cease; to set off, to embellish; to set in, to begin  a continual tenour; to set out, to begin a course or journey; to  take off, to copy; with innumerable expressions of the same kind,  of which some appear wildly irregular, being so far distant from  the sense of the simple words, that no sagacity will be able to  trace the steps by which they arrived at the present use. These  I have noted with great care; and though I cannot flatter myself  that the collection is complete, I believe I have so far assisted  the students of our language, that this kind of phraseology will be  no longer insuperable; and the combinations of verbs and particles,  by chance omitted, will be easily explained by comparison with  those that may be found.    Many words yet stand supported only by the name of Bailey, Ainsworth,  Philips, or the contracted Dict. for Dictionaries subjoined; of  these I am not always certain that they are read in any book but  the works of lexicographers. Of such I have omitted many, because  I had never read them; and many I have inserted, because they may  perhaps exist, though they have escaped my notice: they are, however,  to be yet considered as resting only upon the credit of former  dictionaries. Others, which I considered as useful, or know to be  proper, though I could not at present support them by authorities,  I have suffered to stand upon my own attestation, claiming the same  privilege with my predecessors of being sometimes credited without  proof.    The words, thus selected and disposed, are grammatically considered;  they are referred to the different parts of speech; traced, when  they are irregularly inflected, through their various terminations;  and illustrated by observations, not indeed of great or striking  importance, separately considered, but necessary to the elucidation  of our language, and hitherto neglected or forgotten by English  grammarians.    That part of my work on which I expect malignity most frequently  to fasten, is the explanation; in which I cannot hope to satisfy  those, who are perhaps not inclined to be pleased, since I have  not always been able to satisfy myself. To interpret a language  by itself is very difficult; many words cannot be explained by  synonimes, because the idea signified by them has not more than  one appellation; nor by paraphrase, because simple ideas cannot  be described. When the nature of things is unknown, or the notion  unsettled and indefinite, and various in various minds, the words by  which such notions are conveyed, or such things denoted, will be  ambiguous and perplexed. And such is the fate of hapless lexicography,  that not only darkness, but light, impedes and distresses it;  things may be not only too little, but too much known, to be happily  illustrated. To explain, requires the use of terms less abstruse  than that which is to be explained, and such terms cannot always  be found; for as nothing can be proved but by supposing something  intuitively known, and evident without proof, so nothing can be  defined but by the use of words too plain to admit a definition.    Other words there are, of which the sense is too subtle and evanescent  to be fixed in a paraphrase; such are all those which are by the  grammarians termed expletives, and, in dead languages, are suffered  to pass for empty sounds, of no other use than to fill a verse,  or to modulate a period, but which are easily perceived in living  tongues to have power and emphasis, though it be sometimes such as  no other form of expression can convey.    My labour has likewise been much increased by a class of verbs too  frequent in the English language, of which the signification is  so loose and general, the use so vague and indeterminate, and the  senses detorted so widely from the first idea, that it is hard  to trace them through the maze of variation, to catch them on the  brink of utter inanity, to circumscribe them by any limitations, or  interpret them by any words of distinct and settled meaning; such  are bear, break, come, cast, full, get, give, do, put, set, go,  run, make, take, turn, throw. If of these the whole power is not  accurately delivered, it must be remembered, that while our language  is yet living, and variable by the caprice of every one that speaks  it, these words are hourly shifting their relations, and can no more  be ascertained in a dictionary, than a grove, in the agitation of  a storm, can be accurately delineated from its picture in the water.    The particles are among all nations applied with so great latitude,  that they are not easily reducible under any regular scheme of  explication: this difficulty is not less, nor perhaps greater, in  English, than in other languages. I have laboured them with diligence,  I hope with success; such at least as can be expected in a task,  which no man, however learned or sagacious, has yet been able to  perform.    Some words there are which I cannot explain, because I do not  understand them; these might have been omitted very often with  little inconvenience, but I would not so far indulge my vanity as  to decline this confession: for when Tully owns himself ignorant  whether lessus, in the twelve tables, means a funeral song,  or mourning garment; and Aristotle doubts whether [word in Greek]  in the Iliad, signifies a mule, or muleteer, I may surely, without  shame, leave some obscurities to happier industry, or future  information.    The rigour of interpretative lexicography requires that the  explanation, and the word explained, should always be reciprocal;  this I have always endeavoured, but could not always attain. Words  are seldom exactly synonimous; a new term was not introduced,  but because the former was thought inadequate: names, therefore,  have often many ideas, but few ideas have many names. It was then  necessary to use the proximate word, for the deficiency of single  terms can very seldom be supplied by circumlocution; nor is the  inconvenience great of such mutilated interpretations, because the  sense may easily be collected entire from the examples.    In every word of extensive use, it was requisite to mark the progress  of its meaning, and show by what gradations of intermediate sense  it has passed from its primitive to its remote and accidental  signification; so that every foregoing explanation should tend to  that which follows, and the series be regularly concatenated from  the first notion to the last.    This is specious, but not always practicable; kindred senses may  be so interwoven, that the perplexity cannot be disentangled, nor  any reason be assigned why one should be ranged before the other.  When the radical idea branches out into parallel ramifications,  how can a consecutive series be formed of senses in their nature  collateral? The shades of meaning sometimes pass imperceptibly into  each other; so that though on one side they apparently differ, yet  it is impossible to mark the point of contact. Ideas of the same  race, though not exactly alike, are sometimes so little different,  that no words can express the dissimilitude, though the mind easily  perceives it, when they are exhibited together; and sometimes there  is such a confusion of acceptations, that discernment is wearied,  and distinction puzzled, and perseverance herself hurries to an  end, by crouding together what she cannot separate.    These complaints of difficulty will, by those that have never  considered words beyond their popular use, be thought only the jargon  of a man willing to magnify his labours, and procure veneration to  his studies by involution and obscurity. But every art is obscure  to those that have not learned it: this uncertainty of terms,  and commixture of ideas, is well known to those who have joined  philosophy with grammar; and if I have not expressed them very  clearly, it must be remembered that I am speaking of that which  words are insufficient to explain.    The original sense of words is often driven out of use by their  metaphorical acceptations, yet must be inserted for the sake of  a regular origination.
