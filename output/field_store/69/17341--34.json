Therefore, my dear lord, I would say no word now to stay  you.\"    She spoke bravely and unfalteringly, but her face had paled when Sir  Thomas first made the proposal, and the colour had not yet come back to  her cheeks.    \"Bravely spoken, dame,\" the queen said warmly. \"Well, Sir Thomas, I  accept your offer, and trust that you will not be long separated from  your wife and son, who will of course journey with me when I go to  England, where doubtless you will be able to rejoin us a few days after  we land. Now let us talk over the noblemen and gentlemen in the west,  upon whom we can rely, if not to join our banner as soon as it is  spread, at least to say no word that will betray you.\"    Two days later Sir Thomas Tresham started on his journey, while the  queen remained at Amboise eagerly awaiting the news that Warwick had  collected a fleet, and was ready to set sail. Up to this point the Duke  of Clarence had sided with Warwick against his brother, and had passed  over with him to France, believing, no doubt, that if the Earl should  succeed in dethroning Edward, he intended to place him, his son-in-law,  upon the throne. He was rudely awakened from this delusion by Charles of  Burgundy, who, being in all but open rebellion against his suzerain,  the King of France, kept himself intimately acquainted with all that was  going on. He despatched a female emissary to Clarence to inform him  of the league Warwick had made with the Lancastrians, and the intended  marriage between his daughter Anne and the young prince; imploring him  to be reconciled with his brother and to break off his alliance with the  Earl, who was on the point of waging war against the House of York.    Clarence took the advice, and went over to England, where he made his  peace with Edward, the more easily because the king, who was entirely  given up to pleasure, treated with contempt the warnings the Duke  of Burgundy sent him of the intended invasion by Warwick. And yet a  moment's serious reflection should have shown him that his position was  precarious. The crushing exactions of the tax gatherers, in order to  provide the means for Edward's lavish expenditure, had already caused  very serious insurrections in various parts of the country, and his  unpopularity was deep and general. In one of these risings the royal  troops had suffered a crushing defeat. The Earl Rivers, the father, and  Sir John Woodville, one of the brothers, of the queen had, with the Earl  of Devon, been captured by the rebels, and the three had been beheaded,  and the throne had only been saved by the intervention of Warwick.    Thus, then, Edward had every reason for fearing the result should the  Earl appear in arms against him. He took, however, no measures whatever  to prepare for the coming storm, and although the Duke of Burgundy  despatched a fleet to blockade Harfleur, where Warwick was fitting out  his expedition, and actually sent the name of the port at which the Earl  intended to land if his fleet managed to escape from Harfleur, Edward  continued carelessly to spend his time in pleasure and dissipation,  bestowing his full confidence upon the Archbishop of York and the  Marquis of Montague, both brothers of the Earl of Warwick.    The elements favoured his enemies, for early in September the Duke of  Burgundy's Fleet, off Harfleur, was dispersed by a storm, and Warwick,  as soon as the gale abated, set sail, and on the 13th landed on the  Devonshire coast. His force was a considerable one, for the French king  had furnished him both with money and men; on effecting his landing  he found no army assembled to oppose him. A few hours after his  disembarkation, he was joined by Sir Thomas Tresham, who gave him the  good news that the whole of the west was ready to rise, and that in a  few days all the great landowners would join him with their retainers.  This turned out to be the case, and Warwick, with a great array, marched  eastward. Kent had already risen, and London declared for King  Henry. Warwick, therefore, instead of marching thither, moved towards  Lincolnshire, where Edward was with his army, having gone north to  repress an insurrection that had broken out there at the instigation of  Warwick.    Lord Montague now threw off the mask, and declared for King Henry. Most  of the soldiers followed him, and Edward, finding it hopeless to oppose  Warwick's force, which was now within a short march of him, took ship  with a few friends who remained faithful, and sailed for Holland.  Warwick returned to London, where he took King Henry from the dungeon in  the Tower, into which he himself had, five years before, thrown him, and  proclaimed him king.    On the day that this took place Dame Tresham arrived in London with her  son. The queen had found that she could not for the present cross, as  she was waiting for a large French force which was to accompany her.  As it was uncertain how long the delay might last, she counselled her  friend to join her husband. The revolution had been accomplished without  the loss of a single life, with the exception of that of the Earl  of Worcester, who was hated for his cruelty by the people. Edward's  principal friends took refuge in various religious houses. The  queen, her three daughters, and her mother, fled to the sanctuary at  Westminster. All these were left unmolested, nor was any step taken  against the other adherents of the House of York. Warwick was now  virtually King of England. The king, whose intellect had always been  weak, was now almost an imbecile, and Margaret of Anjou was still  detained in France. Sir Thomas Tresham went down to his estates in Kent,  and there lived quietly for some months. The Duke of Clarence had joined  Warwick as soon as he saw that his brother's cause was lost; and as  the Duke had no knowledge of his changed feelings towards him, he  was heartily welcomed. An act of settlement was passed by Parliament  entailing the Crown on Henry's son Edward, Prince of Wales, and in case  of that prince's death without issue, on the Duke of Clarence. On the  12th of March following (1471) Edward suddenly appeared with a fleet  with which he had been secretly supplied by the Duke of Burgundy, and,  sailing north, landed in the Humber. He found the northern population by  no means disposed to aid him, but upon his taking a solemn oath that  he had no designs whatever upon the throne, but simply claimed to be  restored to his rights and dignities as Duke of York, he was joined by  a sufficient force to enable him to cross the Trent. As he marched south  his army speedily swelled, and he was joined by many great lords.    Warwick had summoned Henry's adherents to the field, and marched  north to meet him. When the armies approached each other, the Duke of  Clarence, who commanded a portion of Henry's army, went over with his  whole force to Edward, and Warwick, being no longer in a position to  give battle, was obliged to draw off and allow Edward to march unopposed  towards London. The citizens, with their usual fickleness, received him  with the same outburst of enthusiasm with which, five months before,  they had greeted the entry of Warwick. The unfortunate King Henry was  again thrown into his dungeon in the Tower, and Edward found himself  once more King of England.    Sir Thomas Tresham, as soon as he heard of the landing of Edward, had  hastened up to London. In his uncertainty how matters would go, he  brought his wife and son up with him, and left them in lodgings, while  he marched north with Warwick. As soon as the defection of Clarence  opened the road to London, he left the Earl, promising to return in  a few days, and rode to town, arriving there two days before Edward's  entry, and, purchasing another horse, took his wife and son down to  St. Albans, where leaving them, he rejoined Warwick. In a few days the  latter had gathered sufficient forces to enable him to risk the fortunes  of a battle, and, marching south, he encamped with his army on the  common north of Barnet. Edward had come out to meet him, and the two  armies slept on Easter Eve within two miles of each other.    Late in the evening Clarence sent a messenger to the Earl, offering to  mediate, but the offer was indignantly refused by Warwick.    In the darkness, neither party was aware of the other's precise  position. Warwick was much stronger than the king in artillery, and had  placed it on his right wing. The king, in his ignorance of the enemy's  position, had placed his troops considerably more to the right than  those of Warwick's army. The latter, believing that Edward's line was  facing his, kept up a heavy cannonade all night upon where he supposed  Edward's left to be--a cannonade which was thus entirely futile.    In the morning (April 14th) a heavy mist covered the country and  prevented either force from seeing the other's dispositions. Warwick  took the command of his left wing, having with him the Duke of Exeter.  Somerset was in command of his centre, and Montague and Oxford of his  right.    Edward placed himself in the centre of his array, the Duke of Gloucester  commanded on his right, and Lord Hastings on his left.    Desirous, from his inferiority in artillery, to fight out the battle  hand to hand, Edward, at six o'clock in the morning, ordered his  trumpets to blow, and, after firing a few shots, advanced through the  mist to attack the enemy. His misconception as to Warwick's position,  which had saved his troops from the effects of the cannonade during the  night, was now disadvantageous to him, for the Earl's right so greatly  outflanked his left that when they came into contact Hastings found  himself nearly surrounded by a vastly superior force. His wing fought  valiantly, but was at length broken by Oxford's superior numbers, and  driven out of the field. The mist prevented the rest of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4940"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Senior Year at High School (#3)"],[1,"the world. My husband  died a number of years ago.\"    \"I knew it, I knew it,\" muttered Grace.    \"What did you say, my dear?\" asked Mrs. Allison.    But Grace was silent. The woman was too nervous as yet to hear the news.  Perhaps after all the name was a mere coincidence.    Anne, understanding Grace's silence, hurriedly took up the conversation.    \"Are you familiar with this part of the country?\" she asked.    \"I have not been here for a number of years,\" replied Mrs. Allison,  \"although my friends, the Gibsons, have sent me repeated invitations.  Mrs. Gibson and I went through Vassar together.\"    \"We expect to go to college next year,\" said Grace. \"We are seniors in  Oakdale High School.\"    \"The years a young girl spends in college are usually the happiest of  her whole life,\" said Mrs. Allison, with a sigh. \"Everything is rose  colored. She forms high ideals that help to sweeten life for her long  after her college career is over. The friendships she forms are usually  worth while, too. Mrs. Gibson and I have kept track of one another even  since graduation. We have shared our joys and sorrows, and in my darkest  hours her loyal friendship and ready sympathy have been a heaven-sent  blessing to me.\"    \"We three girls are sworn friends,\" said Grace, \"and we have another  chum, too. She was very sorry that she could not come to-day. She will  be glad to know that you are so much better. Her name is Jessica Bright.  She was with us at the station yesterday.\"    \"I should like to meet her,\" said Mrs. Allison, \"and I thank her for her  interest in me. I really feel as though I had known you three girls for  a long time. I wish you would tell me more of yourselves and your school  life.\"    \"There isn't much to tell,\" laughed Grace. \"The life of a school-girl is  not crowded with many stirring events.\"    \"You have no idea of how much has happened to Grace, Mrs. Allison, since  we began High School,\" interposed Nora. \"She never will talk about the  splendid things she has done for other people. She is the president of  her class, the captain of the senior basketball team, too, and the most  popular girl in Oakdale High School.\"    \"I refuse to plead guilty to the last statement!\" exclaimed Grace.  \"Believe me, Mrs. Allison, there are a dozen girls in High School who  are far more popular than I.\"    \"There is only one Grace Harlowe,\" said Anne, with conviction.    \"It is a case of two against one, Miss Grace,\" laughed Mrs. Allison. \"I  insist upon hearing about some of your good works.\"    \"It's really time for us to go, girls,\" said Grace, laughing a little.  She rose and held out her hand to the older woman.    \"You are very cruel,\" smiled Mrs. Allison. \"You arouse my curiosity and  then refuse to satisfy it. But you cannot escape so easily. You must  come to see me again before I leave here. I shall not try to return to  the Gibsons before Wednesday. I expect Mr. Gibson here to-morrow and he  will attend to my New York business for me. If I had accepted his offer  in the first place, I might have spared myself this accident. However, I  am glad, now. It has brought me charming friends. For I feel that we  shall become friends,\" she added, stretching out both hands. \"When will  you come again?\"    \"On Tuesday afternoon after school,\" replied Grace promptly. \"And we  will bring Miss Bright, too, unless she and Mabel have some other  engagement.\"    There was purpose in Grace's last remark. She wished to see if the name  \"Mabel\" made any impression upon her listener, and therefore kept her  eyes fixed upon Mrs. Allison.    As Grace carelessly mentioned the name she saw an expression of pain  flit across Mrs. Allison's fine face.    \"I shall be glad to see Miss Bright,\" she said quietly. \"Is the 'Mabel'  you speak of her sister?\"    \"No,\" replied Grace hastily, \"she is a girl friend. May we bring her  with us?\"    \"Do so by all means,\" rejoined Mrs. Allison. \"She bears the name I love  best in all the world.\" An expression of deep sadness crept into her  face as she uttered these words, and she looked past her callers with  unseeing eyes. \"Good-bye, Mrs. Allison,\" said Grace, and the older woman  roused herself with a start.    \"Good-bye, my dears,\" she responded. \"Be sure to come to me on Tuesday.\"    \"We'll be here,\" chorused the three girls. \"Take good care of yourself.\"    Not a word was spoken until they reached the street.    \"Well!\" exclaimed Grace. \"What do you think of the whole thing?\"    \"I think there are several people due to get a shock,\" said Nora  emphatically.    \"I am sorry for Jessica,\" said Anne. \"It will be very hard for her to  give Mabel up.\"    \"Then you think--\" said Grace, looking at Anne.    \"I am reasonably sure,\" replied Anne quietly, \"from what I have heard  and seen to-day that Mabel is no longer motherless.\"          CHAPTER III    WHAT HAPPENED IN ROOM FORTY-SEVEN      As the last period of study drew to an end on Tuesday afternoon, the  hearts of the four girl chums beat a trifle faster than usual. What if  after all their conjectures were to prove erroneous, and Mabel Allison  was not the long-lost daughter of the woman in the hospital? All they  had to go by was the remarkable resemblance between the two, and the  slight emotion displayed by Mrs. Allison at the mention of Mabel's name.    When Grace had repeated the details of their call at the hospital to  Jessica, the latter had turned very white, but had said bravely, \"I  expected it. We will go with you on Tuesday. Shall I prepare Mabel for  it?\"    \"No,\" Grace had replied. \"We may find ourselves mistaken, and think what  a cruel disappointment it would be to Mabel. I don't mean by that  Jessica, that Mabel is anxious to leave you, but you know perfectly well  that the desire of Mabel's life is that she may some day find her  parents.\"    In almost utter silence the four chums, accompanied by Mabel Allison,  crossed the campus and turned into High School Street at the close of  the afternoon session on Tuesday. Each girl seemed busy with her own  thoughts.    \"What has come over you girls?\" inquired Mabel curiously. \"When four of  the liveliest girls in school become mum as the proverbial oyster,  surely something is going to happen.\"    \"'Coming events cast their shadows before'\" said Anne half dreamily.    \"Well, I wish they'd stop casting shadows over my little playmates  then,\" laughed Mabel.    At this remark Grace made an effort to appear unconcerned.    \"Are you going to play on the junior basketball team this year, Mabel?\"  she asked, by way of changing the subject.    \"I don't know,\" replied Mabel. \"I feel as though I ought to study every  minute I am in High School, in order to be more thoroughly capable of  earning my own living. I don't expect to be forever dependent upon my  friends.\"    \"Dependent, indeed,\" sniffed Jessica. \"You know perfectly well, you bad  child, that papa and I have been the gainers since you came to us, and  now--\" she stopped just in time.    \"'And now,' what?\" asked Mabel.    \"Here we are at the hospital,\" broke in Nora without giving Jessica time  to answer.    The little party waited what seemed to them an interminable length of  time; although it was in reality not more than five minutes before the  attendant returned with the news that they might see the patient in 47.    Grace had purposely voiced their request in so low a tone that Mabel had  not heard her mention the patient's name, and she accompanied the four  girls without the faintest idea of what their call might mean to her.    \"Now for it,\" breathed Grace, as they paused at the door of 47.    \"Come in,\" said a sweet voice, in answer to the attendant's knock, and  the five girls were ushered into Mrs. Allison's presence.    \"How are my young friends, to-day!\" she cried gayly, rising from the  easy chair in which she was sitting and coming forward with  out-stretched hands.    \"Very well, indeed,\" replied Grace, Anne and Nora in a breath as they  shook hands.    \"Mrs. Allison,\" said Grace hurriedly, \"these are my friends, Miss  Jessica Bright and Miss Mabel Allison.\"    The woman who was in the act of acknowledging the introduction to  Jessica started violently when Grace pronounced Mabel's name, dropped  Jessica's hand and began to tremble as she caught sight of Mabel, who  stood behind Jessica, an expression of amazement in her brown eyes, that  the patient's name should be the same as her own.    \"Who--who--\" gasped the woman, pointing at Mabel, then overcome sank  into her chair, covering her face with her hands.    Grace sprang to her side in an instant, kneeling beside her chair.    \"Mrs. Allison,\" she cried impulsively. \"Forgive me. I should not have  startled you so. I did not really know, although I felt sure that--\"    But Mrs. Allison had uncovered her face and was looking eagerly at  Mabel, who stood the picture of mystification.    \"Who is that young girl who bears the name of my baby, and where did she  come from?\" asked the patient hoarsely.    \"Speak to her,\" whispered Jessica, pushing Mabel forward.    \"I am Mabel Isabel Allison--\" began Mabel, but before she could proceed  further the woman had risen, and clasping the girl in her arms, began  smoothing her hair and kissing her, laughing and crying hysterically.  \"You are my baby girl that I lost long ago, my own little Mabel. I know  it. I know it.\"    \"Mrs. Allison,\" said Grace firmly, placing her arm around the sobbing  woman, who seemed to have entirely lost control of her emotions, \"try  and be calm. There is so much to tell. Will you listen to me? And you  must sit down, you were not strong enough for this. We should have  waited.\"    Mrs. Allison partially released Mabel from her embrace, though she still  held her hand, and allowed Grace to gently push her back toward her  chair.    \"I don't quite understand you, my dear,\" she said brokenly. \"But I am  sure that I have found my own dear little child.\"    \"And I am sure of it, too,\" replied"]]]
