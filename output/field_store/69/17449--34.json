[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7001"],[0,"History of the Philippine Islands (#3)"],[1,", is further increased  by Captain Juan de Mendoza Gamboa and Fray Juan Maldonado, a learned  Dominican, and their men. The former, having obtained permission to  go on a trading expedition to Siam, for which he is given letters of  embassy, is also entrusted to convey certain supplies to Don Luis  at Camboja, where he fails to find him. Maldonado is sent by his  order as a companion to Don Luis. This addition to their forces is  welcomed by the Spaniards in Camboja, and they refuse to let them  depart until hearing definite news of Luis Perez. The arrival of  a contingent of Japanese, mestizos, and one Spaniard, who had left  Japan on a piratical expedition, still further increases the force  in Camboja. The leaders Blas Ruiz, Belloso, and Maldonado treat  with the king on their own account, but not so satisfactorily as  they wish. Conflicts and quarrels arising between their forces and  the Malays, the latter finally overpower and kill the Spaniards,  Portuguese, and Japanese, except several who remain in the country  and Mendoza, Maldonado and a few men who escape in the former's  vessel. In Camboja confusion and anarchy again reign and the king is  bullied and finally killed by the Malays. The Joloans and Mindanaos  are emboldened by the final abandonment and dismantling of the fort  at La Caldera--which is decided upon by the governor against the  opinion of the Audiencia--and, joined in self-defense by the peaceful  natives of Mindanao, make an incursion against Spaniards and natives  in the Pintados in 1599, in which they take immense booty and many  captives. The next year they return with a larger force, but are  defeated by the alcalde-mayor of Arevalo, whereupon they resolve to  be revenged. In Japan the death of Taicosama encourages Geronimo de  Jesus, a Franciscan who has escaped crucifixion, to open negotiations  with his successor Daifusama. The latter, desiring trade for his  own northern province of Quanto, requests the governor of Manila,  through the religious, for commerce, and men to build ships for the  Nueva España trade which he wishes to open. He does not negotiate  concerning religion, for \"the profit and benefit to be derived from  friendship and commerce with the Spaniards was more to the taste of  Daifusama than what he had heard concerning their religion.\" However,  the religious writes that freedom is given to evangelize throughout  Japan, although the only concession given is that the religious could  establish a house at their trading station. In October of 1600 news  reaches Manila of the coming and depredations of Oliver van Noordt's  two vessels. The description of the preparations, made by Morga,  the instructions given him by the governor, his instructions to  Juan de Alcega, and the fight and its consequences follow. In the  same year of 1600 the vessels \"Santa Margarita\" and \"San Geronymo\"  are both unable to reach Nueva España, and are wrecked--the latter  near Catanduanes, and the former in the Ladrones, where it is  rifled by the natives and the men surviving distributed through  the different villages. In 1600 the \"Santo Tomas\" on its way to the  islands puts in at the Ladrones, but the commander, fearing storms,  refuses to wait for the Spanish prisoners of the \"Santa Margarita,\"  although petitioned to do so by the religious and others. Accordingly  a Franciscan, Juan Pobre, full of pity for the unfortunate men, casts  in his lot with them and voluntarily remains behind. The \"San Felipe\"  is wrecked eighty leguas from Manila, and its cargo taken overland to  that city. Mindanao and Jolo affairs are meanwhile given into command  of Gallinato, and although he is partially successful, the rains,  hunger, and disease work for the natives, and finally in May of 1602,  Gallinato sends to Manila for instructions. Juan de Mendoza and Fray  Juan Maldonado, after leaving Camboja proceed on their journey to  Siam, but are received there coldly by the king, and their trading  is unsatisfactory. Fearing violence they depart one night without  notifying the Siamese, taking with them certain Portuguese held in  Siam as partial prisoners, but are pursued by the Siamese who molest  them until in the open sea. From wounds received during the week's  continual conflict both Mendoza and Maldonado die, the latter first  writing to his Order and advising them \"on their consciences not to  again become instruments of a return to Camboja.\" Troubles in Maluco  between the Dutch and natives on the one side and the Portuguese and  Spanish on the other, render it necessary to send aid several times  from Manila. In March of 1601, a letter is written by the king of  Tidore to Morga requesting aid against Ternate and the Dutch, in  response to which supplies and reënforcements are sent in 1602.    The seventh chapter deals with events during the period of Pedro de  Acuña's administration. With his arrival in May of 1602, new life and  energy are infused in public affairs. The new governor first concerns  himself with home affairs. He constructs galleys but has to postpone  an intended visit to Pintados, in order to attend to Japan and Jolo,  and despatch the vessels to Nueva España. It is determined to open  commerce with Quanto, but to defer the matter of sending workmen to  Japan to show the Japanese how to construct ships, as that will be  detrimental. Religious of the various orders go to Japan, but are  received less warmly than Geronymo de Jesus's letter leads them to  expect. The latter pressed by Daifusama for the performance of his  promises finally asks permission to go to Manila to advocate them  in person, whence he brings back assurance of trade with Quanto. The  vessel despatched there is forced to put in at another port, but is  allowed to trade there and to return. Two vessels despatched to Nueva  España in 1602 are forced to return, putting in on the way--the first  at the Ladrones and the other at Japan. The first brings back most of  the men wrecked at the Ladrones. The second after rough treatment in  Japan finally escapes. As a result of an embassy sent to Daifusama from  this vessel chapas or writs of safety are provided to the Spaniards so  that any vessel putting into Japanese ports will be well treated in  the future. The reënforcements sent to Gallinato at Jolo serve only  to enable him to break camp and return to Manila. While Acuña is on  his way to Pintados to inspect those islands, a raiding expedition of  Moros goes as far as Luzon and Mindoro, committing many depredations,  thus compelling the governor to return, who narrowly escapes capture. A  punitive expedition of Spaniards and Indians sent in pursuit of the  Moros inflicts but slight damage. Shortly before this a fleet prepared  at Goa for the chastisement of the Malucos sets out under Andrea  Furtado de Mendoza, but is separated by storms. Some of the vessels  with the commander reach Amboina, but in so crippled and destitute  a condition that they are forced to ask help from Manila. Acuña,  although arranging independently for an expedition to Maluco, sends  a force there under Gallinato in 1603 to aid the Portuguese. Early  in that year the prelude to the Chinese troubles of that same year  is given by the coming of the Chinese mandarins to see the island of  gold, which causes many, among them the archbishop and some religious,  to counsel watchfulness. In 1603 occurs the second disastrous fire  in Manila, with a loss of over one million pesos.    The victorious Malays in Camboja are finally driven out by a  combination of patriotic mandarins, and make the brother of their old  king sovereign, whereupon relations between Camboja and the Philippines  are again established by sending there a number of religious. In May  of 1603 two ships with reënforcements arrive at Manila, bringing  certain ecclesiastical news. The aid rendered Furtado de Mendoza  by Gallinato does not prove sufficient to subdue the Ternatans, and  Gallinato returns to Manila. The present installment of Morga ends  with the courteous letter written to Acuña by Furtado de Mendoza,  in which he renders praise to Gallinato and his men. The remainder  of the book will appear in the succeeding volume.    The present volume ends with two appendices: the first an abstract  of Thomas Candish's circumnavigation; the second an abstract of Dutch  expeditions to the East Indies.

The author has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7005"],[0,"The Antiquary — Complete (#3)"],[1,"author may add another picture of the same kind as Edie Ochiltree  and Andrew Gemmells; considering these illustrations as a sort of  gallery, open to the reception of anything which may elucidate former  manners, or amuse the reader.    The author's contemporaries at the university of Edinburgh will probably  remember the thin, wasted form of a venerable old Bedesman, who stood  by the Potterrow-Port, now demolished, and, without speaking a syllable,  gently inclined his head, and offered his hat, but with the least  possible degree of urgency, towards each individual who passed. This man  gained, by silence and the extenuated and wasted appearance of a palmer  from a remote country, the same tribute which was yielded to Andrew  Gemmells' sarcastic humour and stately deportment. He was understood to  be able to maintain a son a student in the theological classes of the  University, at the gate of which the father was a mendicant. The young  man was modest and inclined to learning, so that a student of the same  age, and whose parents where rather of the lower order, moved by seeing  him excluded from the society of other scholars when the secret of his  birth was suspected, endeavoured to console him by offering him some  occasional civilities. The old mendicant was grateful for this attention  to his son, and one day, as the friendly student passed, he stooped  forward more than usual, as if to intercept his passage. The scholar  drew out a halfpenny, which he concluded was the beggar's object, when  he was surprised to receive his thanks for the kindness he had shown to  Jemmie, and at the same time a cordial invitation to dine with them next  Saturday, \"on a shoulder of mutton and potatoes,\" adding, \"ye'll put on  your clean sark, as I have company.\" The student was strongly tempted  to accept this hospitable proposal, as many in his place would  probably have done; but, as the motive might have been capable of  misrepresentation, he thought it most prudent, considering the character  and circumstances of the old man, to decline the invitation.    Such are a few traits of Scottish mendicity, designed to throw light on  a Novel in which a character of that description plays a prominent  part. We conclude, that we have vindicated Edie Ochiltree's right to the  importance assigned him; and have shown, that we have known one beggar  take a hand at cards with a person of distinction, and another give  dinner parties.    I know not if it be worth while to observe, that the Antiquary,* was not  so well received on its first appearance as either of its predecessors,  though in course of time it rose to equal, and, with some readers,  superior popularity.    * Note A. Mottoes.          EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION TO THE ANTIQUARY.    \"THE ANTIQUARY\" was begun in 1815; the bargain for its publication by  Constable was made in the October of that year. On December 22 Scott  wrote to Morritt: \"I shall set myself seriously to 'The Antiquary,' of  which I have only a very general sketch at present; but when once I get  my pen to the paper it will walk fast enough. I am sometimes tempted to  leave it alone, and try whether it will not write as well without the  assistance of my head as with it,--a hopeful prospect for the reader!'\"  It is amazing enough that he even constructed \"a general sketch,\" for  to such sketches he confesses that he never could keep constant. \"I have  generally written to the middle of one of these novels without having  the least idea how it was to end,--in short, in the hab nab at a venture  style of composition\" (Journal, Feb. 24, 1828). Yet it is almost  impossible but that the plot of \"The Antiquary\" should have been duly  considered. Scott must have known from the first who Lovel was to  turn out to be, and must have recognised in the hapless bride of  Lord Glenallan the object of the Antiquary's solitary and unfortunate  passion. To introduce another Wandering Heir immediately after the Harry  Bertram of \"Guy Mannering\" was rather audacious. But that old favourite,  the Lost Heir, is nearly certain to be popular. For the Antiquary's  immortal sorrow Scott had a model in his own experience. \"What a romance  to tell!--and told, I fear, it will one day be. And then my three years  of dreaming and my two years of wakening will be chronicled doubtless.  But the dead will feel no pain.\" The dead, as Aristotle says, if they  care for such things at all, care no more than we do for what has passed  in a dream.    The general sketch probably began to take full shape about the last day  of 1815. On December 29 Scott wrote to Ballantyne:--              DEAR JAMES,--                 I've done, thank'God, with the long yarns                     Of the most prosy of Apostles--Paul, 1                 And now advance, sweet heathen of Monkbarns,                    Step out, old quizz, as fast as I can scrawl.    In \"The Antiquary\" Scott had a subject thoroughly to his mind. He  had been an antiquary from his childhood. His earliest pence had  been devoted to that collection of printed ballads which is still  at Abbotsford. These he mentions in the unfinished fragment of his  \"Reliquiae Trotcosienses,\" in much the same words as in his manuscript  note on one of the seven volumes.    \"This little collection of Stall tracts and ballads was formed by me,  when a boy, from the baskets of the travelling pedlars. Until put into  its present decent binding it had such charms for the servants that it  was repeatedly, and with difficulty, recovered from their clutches. It  contains most of the pieces that were popular about thirty years since,  and, I dare say, many that could not now be procured for any price  (1810).\"    Nor did he collect only--                          \"The rare melody of some old ditties            That first were sung to please King Pepin's cradle.    \"Walter had soon begun to gather out-of-the-way things of all sorts. He  had more books than shelves [sic]; a small painted cabinet with Scotch  and Roman coins in it, and so forth. A claymore and Lochaber axe,  given him by old Invernahyle, mounted guard on a little print of Prince  Charlie; and Broughton's Saucer was hooked up on the wall below it.\" He  had entered literature through the ruined gateway of archleology, in the  \"Border Minstrelsy,\" and his last project was an edition of Perrault's  \"Contes de Ma Mere l'Oie.\" As pleasant to him as the purchase of new  lands like Turn Again, bought dearly, as in Monkbarns's case, from  \"bonnet lauds,\" was a fresh acquisition of an old book or of old armour.  Yet, with all his enthusiasm, he did not please the antiquaries of his  own day. George Chalmers, in Constable's \"Life and Correspondence\"  (i. 431), sneers at his want of learning. \"His notes are loose and  unlearned, as they generally are.\" Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, his  friend in life, disported himself in jealous and ribald mockery of  Scott's archaeological knowledge, when Scott was dead. In a letter of  the enigmatic Thomas Allen, or James Stuart Hay, father of John Sobieski  and Charles Edward Stuart, this mysterious person avers that he never  knew Scott's opinion to be held as of any value by antiquaries (1829).  They probably missed in him \"a sort of pettifogging intimacy with dates,  names, and trifling matters of fact,--a tiresome and frivolous accuracy  of memory\" which Sir Arthur Wardour reproves in Monkbarns. Scott, in  brief, was not as Dry-as-dust; all the dead bones that he touches come  to life. He was as great an archeologist as a poet can be, and, with  Virgil, was the greatest antiquary among poets. Like Monkbarns, he was  not incapable of being beguiled. As Oldbuck bought the bodle from the  pedlar at the price of a rare coin, so Scott took Surtees's \"Barthram's  Dirge,\" and his Latin legend of the tourney with the spectre knight, for  genuine antiquities. No Edie Ochiltree ever revealed to him the truth  about these forgeries, and the spectre knight, with the ballad of  \"Anthony Featherstonhaugh,\" hold their own in \"Marmion,\" to assure the  world that this antiquary was gullible when the sleight was practised by  a friend. \"Non est tanti,\" he would have said, had he learned the truth;  for he was ever conscious of the humorous side of the study of the  mouldering past. \"I do not know anything which relieves the mind so much  from the sullens as a trifling discourse about antiquarian oldwomanries.  It is like knitting a stocking,--diverting the mind without occupying  it.\" (\"Journal,\" March 9, 1828).    Begun about Jan. 1, 1816, \"The Antiquary\" was published before May 16,  1816, when Scott writes to say that he has sent Mr. Morritt the novel  \"some time since.\" \"It is not so interesting as its predecessors; the  period does not admit of so much romantic situation. But it has been  more fortunate than any of them in the sale, for six thousand went off  in the first six days, and it is now at press again.\" The Preface of the  first edition ends with the melancholy statement that the author \"takes  his respectful leave, as one who is not likely again to solicit favour.\"  Apparently Scott had already determined not to announce his next novels  (\"The Black Dwarf\" and \"Old Mortality\") as \"by the Author of Waverley.\"  Mr. Constable, in the biography of his father, says (iii. 84): \"Even  before the publication of 'The Antiquary,' John Ballantyne had been  impowered by the Author to negotiate with Mr. Murray and Mr. Blackwood  for the first series of the 'Tales of my Landlord.'\" The note of  withdrawal from the stage, in the first edition of \"The Antiquary,\"  was probably only a part of another experiment on public sagacity. As  Lockhart says, Mr. Murray and Mr. Blackwood thought that the consequent  absence of the Author of \"Waverley's\" name from the \"Tales of my  Landlord\" would \"check very much the first success of the book;\" but  they risked this, \"to disturb Constable's tenure.\"    Scott's temporary desertion of Constable"]]]
