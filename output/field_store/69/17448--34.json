[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6985"],[0,"A Prefect's Uncle (#3)"],[1," But when the M.C.C. or  the Incogniti came down, bringing seasoned county men who knew what  fast bowling really was, and rather preferred it on the whole to slow,  then Gethryn was called upon.    Most Beckfordians who did not play cricket on the first day of term  went on the river. A few rode bicycles or strolled out into the country  in couples, but the majority, amongst whom on this occasion was  Marriott, sallied to the water and hired boats. Marriott was one of the  six old cricket colours--the others were Norris, Gosling, Gethryn,  Reece, and Pringle of the School House--who formed the foundation of  this year's Eleven. He was not an ornamental bat, but stood quite alone  in the matter of tall hitting. Twenty minutes of Marriott when in form  would often completely alter the course of a match. He had been given  his colours in the previous year for making exactly a hundred in  sixty-one minutes against the Authentics when the rest of the team had  contributed ninety-eight. The Authentics made a hundred and  eighty-four, so that the School just won; and the story of how there  were five men out in the deep for him, and how he put the slow bowler  over their heads and over the ropes eight times in three overs, had  passed into a school legend.    But today other things than cricket occupied his attention. He had run  Wilson to earth, and was engaged in making his acquaintance, according  to instructions received.    'Are you Wilson?' he asked. 'P.V. Wilson?'    Wilson confirmed the charge.    'My name's Marriott. Does that convey any significance to your young  mind?'    'Oh, yes. My mater knows somebody who knows your aunt.'    'It is a true bill.'    'And she said you would look after me. I know you won't have time, of  course.'    'I expect I shall have time to give you all the looking after you'll  require. It won't be much, from all I've heard. Was all that true about  you and young Skinner?'    Wilson grinned.    'I did have a bit of a row with a chap called Skinner,' he admitted.    'So Skinner seems to think,' said Marriott. 'What was it all about?'    'Oh, he made an ass of himself,' said Wilson vaguely.    Marriott nodded.    'He would. I know the man. I shouldn't think you'd have much trouble  with Skinner in the future. By the way, I've got you for a fag this  term. You don't have to do much in the summer. Just rot around, you  know, and go to the shop for biscuits and things, that's all. And,  within limits of course, you get the run of the study.'    'I see,' said Wilson gratefully. The prospect was pleasant.    'Oh yes, and it's your privilege to pipe-clay my cricket boots  occasionally before First matches. You'll like that. Can you steer a  boat?'    'I don't think so. I never tried.'    'It's easy enough. I'll tell you what to do. Anyhow, you probably won't  steer any worse than I row, so let's go and get a boat out, and I'll  try and think of a few more words of wisdom for your benefit.'    At the nets Norris had finished his innings, and Pringle was batting in  his stead. Gethryn had given up his ball to Baynes, who bowled slow  leg-breaks, and was the most probable of the probables above-mentioned.  He went to where Norris was taking off his pads, and began to talk to  him. Norris was the head of Jephson's House, and he and the Bishop were  very good friends, in a casual sort of way. If they did not see one  another for a couple of days, neither of them broke his heart.  Whenever, on the other hand, they did meet, they were always glad, and  always had plenty to talk about. Most school friendships are of that  description.    'You were sending down some rather hot stuff,' said Norris, as Gethryn  sat down beside him, and began to inspect Pringle's performance with a  critical eye.    'I did feel rather fit,' said he. 'But I don't think half those that  got you would have taken wickets in a match. You aren't in form yet.'    'I tell you what it is, Bishop,' said Norris, 'I believe I'm going to  be a rank failure this season. Being captain does put one off.'    'Don't be an idiot, man. How can you possibly tell after one day's play  at the nets?'    'I don't know. I feel so beastly anxious somehow. I feel as if I was  personally responsible for every match lost. It was all right last year  when John Brown was captain. Good old John! Do you remember his running  you out in the Charchester match?'    'Don't,' said Gethryn pathetically. 'The only time I've ever felt as if  I really was going to make that century. By Jove, see that drive?  Pringle seems all right.'    'Yes, you know, he'll simply walk into his Blue when he goes up to the  Varsity. What do you think of Baynes?'    'Ought to be rather useful on his wicket. Jephson thinks he's good.'    Mr Jephson looked after the School cricket.    'Yes, I believe he rather fancies him,' said Norris. 'Says he ought to  do some big things if we get any rain. Hullo, Pringle, are you coming  out? You'd better go in, then, Bishop.'    'All right. Thanks. Oh, by Jove, though, I forgot. I can't. I've got to  go down to the station to meet an uncle of mine.'    'What's he coming up today for? Why didn't he wait till we'd got a  match of sorts on?'    'I don't know. The man's probably a lunatic. Anyhow, I shall have to go  and meet him, and I shall just do it comfortably if I go and change  now.'    'Oh! Right you are! Sammy, do you want a knock?'    Samuel Wilberforce Gosling, known to his friends and admirers as Sammy,  replied that he did not. All he wanted now, he said, was a drink, or  possibly two drinks, and a jolly good rest in the shade somewhere.  Gosling was one of those rare individuals who cultivate bowling at the  expense of batting, a habit the reverse of what usually obtains in  schools.    Norris admitted the justice of his claims, and sent in a Second Eleven  man, Baker, a member of his own House, in Pringle's place. Pringle and  Gosling adjourned to the School shop for refreshment.    Gethryn walked with them as far as the gate which opened on to the road  where most of the boarding Houses stood, and then branched off in the  direction of Leicester's. To change into everyday costume took him a  quarter of an hour, at the end of which period he left the House, and  began to walk down the road in the direction of the station.    It was an hour's easy walking between Horton, the nearest station to  Beckford, and the College. Gethryn, who was rather tired after his  exertions at the nets, took it very easily, and when he arrived at his  destination the church clock was striking four.    'Is the three-fifty-six in yet?' he asked of the solitary porter who  ministered to the needs of the traveller at Horton station.    'Just a-coming in now, zur,' said the porter, adding, in a sort of  inspired frenzy: ''Orton! 'Orton stertion! 'Orton!' and ringing a bell  with immense enthusiasm and vigour.    Gethryn strolled to the gate, where the station-master's son stood at  the receipt of custom to collect the tickets. His uncle was to arrive  by this train, and if he did so arrive, must of necessity pass this way  before leaving the platform. The train panted in, pulled up, whistled,  and puffed out again, leaving three people behind it. One of these was  a woman of sixty (approximately), the second a small girl of ten, the  third a young gentleman in a top hat and Etons, who carried a bag, and  looked as if he had seen the hollowness of things, for his face wore a  bored, supercilious look. His uncle had evidently not arrived, unless  he had come disguised as an old woman, an act of which Gethryn refused  to believe him capable.    He enquired as to the next train that was expected to arrive from  London. The station-master's son was not sure, but would ask the  porter, whose name it appeared was Johnny. Johnny gave the correct  answer without an effort. 'Seven-thirty it was, sir, except on  Saturdays, when it was eight o'clock.'    'Thanks,' said the Bishop. 'Dash the man, he might at least have  wired.'    He registered a silent wish concerning the uncle who had brought him a  long three miles out of his way with nothing to show at the end of it,  and was just turning to leave the station, when the top-hatted small  boy, who had been hovering round the group during the conversation,  addressed winged words to him. These were the winged words--    'I say, are you looking for somebody?' The Bishop stared at him as a  naturalist stares at a novel species of insect.    'Yes,' he said. 'Why?'    'Is your name Gethryn?'    This affair, thought the Bishop, was beginning to assume an uncanny  aspect.    'How the dickens did you know that?' he said.    'Oh, then you are Gethryn? That's all right. I was told you were going  to be here to meet this train. Glad to make your acquaintance. My  name's Farnie. I'm your uncle, you know.'    'My what?' gurgled the Bishop.    'Your uncle. U-n, un; c-l-e--kul. Uncle. Fact, I assure you.'          [3]    THE UNCLE MAKES HIMSELF AT HOME      'But, dash it,' said Gethryn, when he had finished gasping, 'that must  be rot!'    'Not a bit,' said the self-possessed youth. 'Your mater was my elder  sister. You'll find it works out all right. Look here. A, the daughter  of B and C, marries. No, look here. I was born when you were four.  See?'    Then the demoralized Bishop remembered. He had heard of his juvenile  uncle, but the tales had made little impression upon him. Till now they  had not crossed one another's tracks.    'Oh, all right,' said he, 'I'll take your word for it. You seem to have  been getting up the subject.'    'Yes. Thought you might want to know about it. I say, how far is it to  Beckford, and how do you get there?'    Up till now Gethryn had scarcely realized that his uncle was actually  coming to the School for good. These words brought the fact home to  him.

By soaking a bone in weak muriatic acid, and thus dissolving the mineral  matter, its shape will not change, but its stiffness will disappear,  leaving a tough, gristly substance [Footnote: Mix a wineglass of muriatic  acid with a pint of water, and place in it a sheep's rib. In a day or two,  the bone will become so soft that it can be tied into a knot. In the same  way, an egg may be made so pliable that it can be crowded into a narrow-  necked bottle, within which it will expand, and become an object of great  curiosity to the uninitiated. By boiling bones at a high temperature, the  animal matter separates in the form of gelatine. Dogs and cats extract the  animal matter from the bones they eat. Fossil bones deposited in the  ground during the Geologic period, were found by Cuvier to contain  considerable animal matter. Gelatine was actually extracted from the  Cambridge mastodon, and made into glue. A tolerably nutritious food might  thus be manufactured from bones older than man himself.] (cartilage) which  can be bent like rubber.    If the bone be burned in the fire, thus consuming the animal matter, the  shape will still be the same, but it will have lost its tenacity, and the  beautiful, pure-white residue [Footnote: From bones thus calcined, the  phosphorus of the chemist is made. See Steele's \"Popular Chemistry,\" page  114. If the animal matter be not consumed, but only charred, the bone will  be black and brittle. In this way, the \"boneblack\" of commerce is  manufactured.] may be crumbled into powder with the fingers.    FIG. 2.    [Illustration: _The Thigh Bone, or Femur, sawed lengthwise._]    We thus see that a bone receives hardness and rigidity from its mineral,  and tenacity and elasticity from its animal matter.    The entire bone is at first composed of cartilage, which gradually  _ossifies_ or turns to bone. [Footnote: The ossification of the bones  on the sides and upper part of the skull, for example, begins by a rounded  spot in the middle of each one. From this spot the ossification extends  outward in every direction, thus gradually approaching the edges of the  bone. When two adjacent bones meet, there will be a line where their edges  are in contact with each other, but have not yet united; but when more  than two bones meet in this way, there will be an empty space between them  at their point of junction. Thus, if you lay down three coins upon the  table with their edges touching one another, there will be a three-sided  space in the middle between them; if you lay down four coins in the same  manner, the space between them will be four-sided. Now at the back part of  the head there is a spot where three bones come together in this way,  leaving a small, three-sided opening between them: this is called the  \"posterior fontanelle.\" On the top of the head, four bones come together,  leaving between them a large, four-sided opening: this is called the  \"anterior fontanelle.\" These openings are termed the _fontanelles_,  because we can feel the pulsations of the brain through them, like the  bubbling of water in a fountain. They gradually diminish in size, owing to  the growth of the bony parts around them, and are completely closed at the  age of four years after birth.--DALTON.] Certain portions near the joints  are long delayed in this process, and by their elasticity assist in  breaking the shock of a fall. [Footnote: Frogs and toads, which move by  jumping, and consequently receive so many jars, retain these unossified  portions (epiphyses) nearly through, life, while alligators and turtles  whose position is sprawling, and whose motions are measured do not have  them at all--LEIDY] Hence the bones of children are tough, are not readily  fractured, and when broken easily heal again; [Footnote: This is only one  of the many illustrations of the Infinite care that watches over helpless  infancy, until knowledge and ability are acquired to meet the perils of  life.] while those of elderly people are liable to fracture, and do not  quickly unite.    FIG. 3.    [Illustration: _A thin slice of Bone, highly magnified showing the  lacunæ, the tiny tubes (canaliculi) radiating from them, and four  Haversian canals, three seen crosswise and one lengthwise._]    THE STRUCTURE OF THE BONES--When a bone is sawed lengthwise, it is found  to be a compact shell filled with a spongy substance This filling  increases in quantity, and becomes more porous at the ends of the bone,  thus giving greater size to form a strong joint, while the solid portion  increases near the middle, where strength alone is needed. Each fiber of  this bulky material diminishes the shock of a sudden blow, and also acts  as a beam to brace the exterior wall. The recumbent position of the  alligator protects him from falls, and therefore his bones contain very  little spongy substance.    In the body, bones are not the dry, dead, blanched things they commonly  seem to be, but are moist, living, pinkish structures, covered with a  tough membrane, called the per-i-os'-te-um [Footnote: The relations of the  periosteum to the bone are very interesting. Instances are on record where  the bone has been removed, leaving the periosteum, from which the entire  bone was afterward renewed.] (_peri_, around, and _osteon_, a  bone), while the hollow is filled with marrow, rich in fat, and full of  blood vessels. If we examine a thin slice with the microscope, we shall  see black spots with lines running in all directions, and looking very  like minute insects. These are really little cavities, called la-cu'-næ  [Footnote: When the bone is dry, the lacunæ are filled with air, which  refracts the light, so that none of it reaches the eye, and hence the  cavities appear black.] from which radiate tiny tubes. The lacunæ are  arranged in circles around larger tubes, termed from their discoverer,  _Haversian canals_, which serve as passages for the blood vessels  that nourish the bone.    GROWTH OF THE BONES.--By means of this system of canals, the blood  circulates as freely through the bones as through any part of the body,  The whole structure is constantly but slowly changing, [Footnote: Bone is  sometimes produced with surprising rapidity. The great Irish Elk is  calculated by Prof. Owen to have cast off and renewed, annually in its  antlers eighty pounds of bone.] old material being taken out and new put  in. A curious illustration is seen in the fact that if madder be mixed  with the food of pigs, it will tinge their bones red.    REPAIR OF THE BONES.--When a bone is broken, the blood at once oozes out  of the fractured ends. This soon gives place to a watery fluid, which in a  fortnight thickens to a gristly substance, strong enough to hold them in  place. Bone matter is then slowly deposited, which in five or six weeks  will unite the broken parts. Nature, at first, apparently endeavors to  remedy the weakness of the material by excess in the quantity, and so the  new portion is larger than the old. But the extra matter will be gradually  absorbed, sometimes so perfectly as to leave no trace of the injury. (See  p. 271.)    A broken limb should be held in place by splints, or a plaster cast, to  enable this process to go on uninterruptedly, and also lest a sudden jar  might rupture the partially mended break. For a long time, the new portion  consists largely of animal matter, and so is tender and pliable. The  utmost care is therefore necessary to prevent a malformation.    THE JOINTS are packed with a soft, smooth cartilage, or gristle, which  fits so perfectly as to be airtight. Upon convex surfaces, it is thickest  at the middle, and upon concave surfaces, it is thickest at the edge, or  where the wear is greatest. In addition, the ends of the bones are covered  with a thin membrane, the _synovial_ (_sun_, with; _ovum_,  an egg), which secretes a viscid fluid, not unlike the white of an egg.  This lubricates the joints, and prevents the noise and wear of friction.  The body is the only machine that oils itself.    The bones which form the joint are tied with stout ligaments (_ligo_,  I bind), or bands, of a smooth, silvery white tissue, [Footnote: The  general term _tissue_ is applied to the various textures of which the  organs are composed. For example, the osseous tissue forms the bones; the  fibrous tissue, the skin, tendons, and ligaments.] so strong that the  bones are sometimes broken without injuring the fastenings.    II. CLASSIFICATION OF THE BONES.    For convenience, the bones of the skeleton are considered in three  divisions: the _head_, the _trunk_, and the _limbs_.    1. THE HEAD.    THE BONES OF THE SKULL AND THE FACE form a cavity for the protection of  the brain and the four organs of sense, viz.: sight, smell, taste, and  hearing. All these bones are immovable except the lower jaw, which is  hinged [Footnote: A ring of cartilage is inserted in its joints, something  after the manner of a washer in machinery. This follows the movements of  the jaw, and admits of freer motion, while it guards against dislocation.]  at the back so as to allow for the opening and shutting of the mouth.    THE SKULL is composed, in general, of two compact plates, with a spongy  layer between. These are in several pieces, the outer ones being joined by  notched edges, sutures (su'tyurs,), in the way carpenters term  dovetailing. (See Fig. 4.)    FIG. 4.    [Illustration: _The Skull._--1. _frontal bone;_ 2, _parietal bone;_  3, _temporal bone;_ 4, _the sphenoid bone;_ 5, _ethmoid bone;_ 6,  _superior maxillary (upper jaw) bone;_ 7, _malar bone;_ 8, _lachrymal  bone;_ 9, _nasal bone;_ 10, _inferior maxillary (lower jaw) bone._]    The peculiar structure and form of the skull afford a perfect shelter for  the brain--an organ so delicate that, if unprotected, an ordinary blow  would destroy it. Its oval or egg shape adapts it to resist pressure. The  smaller and stronger "]]]
