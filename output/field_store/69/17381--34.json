But it has been  kept in pretty good repair, and was all done over about fifteen years  ago--shingled, plastered and re-floored.  It was well built to begin  with.  I understand that there was some romantic story connected with  its building, but the man I rented it from didn't know it.\"    \"He said Captain Jim was the only one who could spin that old yarn now.\"    \"Who is Captain Jim?\"    \"The keeper of the lighthouse on Four Winds Point.  You'll love that  Four Winds light, Anne.  It's a revolving one, and it flashes like a  magnificent star through the twilights.  We can see it from our living  room windows and our front door.\"    \"Who owns the house?\"    \"Well, it's the property of the Glen St. Mary Presbyterian Church now,  and I rented it from the trustees.  But it belonged until lately to a  very old lady, Miss Elizabeth Russell.  She died last spring, and as  she had no near relatives she left her property to the Glen St. Mary  Church.  Her furniture is still in the house, and I bought most of  it--for a mere song you might say, because it was all so old-fashioned  that the trustees despaired of selling it.  Glen St. Mary folks prefer  plush brocade and sideboards with mirrors and ornamentations, I fancy.  But Miss Russell's furniture is very good and I feel sure you'll like  it, Anne.\"    \"So far, good,\" said Anne, nodding cautious approval.  \"But, Gilbert,  people cannot live by furniture alone.  You haven't yet mentioned one  very important thing.  Are there TREES about this house?\"    \"Heaps of them, oh, dryad!  There is a big grove of fir trees behind  it, two rows of Lombardy poplars down the lane, and a ring of white  birches around a very delightful garden.  Our front door opens right  into the garden, but there is another entrance--a little gate hung  between two firs.  The hinges are on one trunk and the catch on the  other.  Their boughs form an arch overhead.\"    \"Oh, I'm so glad!  I couldn't live where there were no trees--something  vital in me would starve.  Well, after that, there's no use asking you  if there's a brook anywhere near.  THAT would be expecting too much.\"    \"But there IS a brook--and it actually cuts across one corner of the  garden.\"    \"Then,\" said Anne, with a long sigh of supreme satisfaction, \"this  house you have found IS my house of dreams and none other.\"        CHAPTER 3    THE LAND OF DREAMS AMONG    \"Have you made up your mind who you're going to have to the wedding,  Anne?\" asked Mrs. Rachel Lynde, as she hemstitched table napkins  industriously.  \"It's time your invitations were sent, even if they are  to be only informal ones.\"    \"I don't mean to have very many,\" said Anne.  \"We just want those we  love best to see us married.  Gilbert's people, and Mr. and Mrs. Allan,  and Mr. and Mrs. Harrison.\"    \"There was a time when you'd hardly have numbered Mr. Harrison among  your dearest friends,\" said Marilla drily.    \"Well, I wasn't VERY strongly attracted to him at our first meeting,\"  acknowledged Anne, with a laugh over the recollection.  \"But Mr.  Harrison has improved on acquaintance, and Mrs. Harrison is really a  dear.  Then, of course, there are Miss Lavendar and Paul.\"    \"Have they decided to come to the Island this summer?  I thought they  were going to Europe.\"    \"They changed their minds when I wrote them I was going to be married.  I had a letter from Paul today.  He says he MUST come to my wedding, no  matter what happens to Europe.\"    \"That child always idolised you,\" remarked Mrs. Rachel.    \"That 'child' is a young man of nineteen now, Mrs. Lynde.\"    \"How time does fly!\" was Mrs. Lynde's brilliant and original response.    \"Charlotta the Fourth may come with them.  She sent word by Paul that  she would come if her husband would let her.  I wonder if she still  wears those enormous blue bows, and whether her husband calls her  Charlotta or Leonora.  I should love to have Charlotta at my wedding.  Charlotta and I were at a wedding long syne.  They expect to be at Echo  Lodge next week.  Then there are Phil and the Reverend Jo----\"    \"It sounds awful to hear you speaking of a minister like that, Anne,\"  said Mrs. Rachel severely.    \"His wife calls him that.\"    \"She should have more respect for his holy office, then,\" retorted Mrs.  Rachel.    \"I've heard you criticise ministers pretty sharply yourself,\" teased  Anne.    \"Yes, but I do it reverently,\" protested Mrs. Lynde.  \"You never heard  me NICKNAME a minister.\"    Anne smothered a smile.    \"Well, there are Diana and Fred and little Fred and Small Anne  Cordelia--and Jane Andrews.  I wish I could have Miss Stacey and Aunt  Jamesina and Priscilla and Stella.  But Stella is in Vancouver, and  Pris is in Japan, and Miss Stacey is married in California, and Aunt  Jamesina has gone to India to explore her daughter's mission field, in  spite of her horror of snakes.  It's really dreadful--the way people  get scattered over the globe.\"    \"The Lord never intended it, that's what,\" said Mrs. Rachel  authoritatively.  \"In my young days people grew up and married and  settled down where they were born, or pretty near it.  Thank goodness  you've stuck to the Island, Anne.  I was afraid Gilbert would insist on  rushing off to the ends of the earth when he got through college, and  dragging you with him.\"    \"If everybody stayed where he was born places would soon be filled up,  Mrs. Lynde.\"    \"Oh, I'm not going to argue with you, Anne.  _I_ am not a B.A.  What  time of the day is the ceremony to be?\"    \"We have decided on noon--high noon, as the society reporters say.  That will give us time to catch the evening train to Glen St. Mary.\"    \"And you'll be married in the parlor?\"    \"No--not unless it rains.  We mean to be married in the orchard--with  the blue sky over us and the sunshine around us.  Do you know when and  where I'd like to be married, if I could?  It would be at dawn--a June  dawn, with a glorious sunrise, and roses blooming in the gardens; and I  would slip down and meet Gilbert and we would go together to the heart  of the beech woods,--and there, under the green arches that would be  like a splendid cathedral, we would be married.\"    Marilla sniffed scornfully and Mrs. Lynde looked shocked.    \"But that would be terrible queer, Anne.  Why, it wouldn't really seem  legal.  And what would Mrs. Harmon Andrews say?\"    \"Ah, there's the rub,\" sighed Anne.  \"There are so many things in life  we cannot do because of the fear of what Mrs. Harmon Andrews would say.  ''Tis true, 'tis pity, and pity 'tis, 'tis true.'  What delightful  things we might do were it not for Mrs. Harmon Andrews!\"    \"By times, Anne, I don't feel quite sure that I understand you  altogether,\" complained Mrs. Lynde.    \"Anne was always romantic, you know,\" said Marilla apologetically.    \"Well, married life will most likely cure her of that,\" Mrs. Rachel  responded comfortingly.    Anne laughed and slipped away to Lover's Lane, where Gilbert found her;  and neither of them seemed to entertain much fear, or hope, that their  married life would cure them of romance.    The Echo Lodge people came over the next week, and Green Gables buzzed  with the delight of them.  Miss Lavendar had changed so little that the  three years since her last Island visit might have been a watch in the  night; but Anne gasped with amazement over Paul.  Could this splendid  six feet of manhood be the little Paul of Avonlea schooldays?    \"You really make me feel old, Paul,\" said Anne.  \"Why, I have to look  up to you!\"    \"You'll never grow old, Teacher,\" said Paul.  \"You are one of the  fortunate mortals who have found and drunk from the Fountain of  Youth,--you and Mother Lavendar.  See here!  When you're married I  WON'T call you Mrs. Blythe.  To me you'll always be 'Teacher'--the  teacher of the best lessons I ever learned.  I want to show you  something.\"    The \"something\" was a pocketbook full of poems.  Paul had put some of  his beautiful fancies into verse, and magazine editors had not been as  unappreciative as they are sometimes supposed to be.  Anne read Paul's  poems with real delight.  They were full of charm and promise.    \"You'll be famous yet, Paul.  I always dreamed of having one famous  pupil.  He was to be a college president--but a great poet would be  even better.  Some day I'll be able to boast that I whipped the  distinguished Paul Irving.  But then I never did whip you, did I, Paul?  What an opportunity lost!  I think I kept you in at recess, however.\"    \"You may be famous yourself, Teacher.  I've seen a good deal of your  work these last three years.\"    \"No.  I know what I can do.  I can write pretty, fanciful little  sketches that children love and editors send welcome cheques for.  But  I can do nothing big.  My only chance for earthly immortality is a  corner in your Memoirs.\"    Charlotta the Fourth had discarded the blue bows but her freckles were  not noticeably less.    \"I never did think I'd come down to marrying a Yankee, Miss Shirley,  ma'am,\" she said.  \"But you never know what's before you, and it isn't  his fault.  He was born that way.\"    \"You're a Yankee yourself, Charlotta, since you've married one.\"    \"Miss Shirley, ma'am, I'm NOT!  And I wouldn't be if I was to marry a  dozen Yankees!  Tom's kind of nice.  And besides, I thought I'd better  not be too hard to please, for I mightn't get another chance.  Tom  don't drink and he don't growl because he has to work between meals,  and when all's said and done I'm satisfied, Miss Shirley, ma'am.\"    \"Does he call you Leonora?\" asked Anne.    \"Goodness, no, Miss Shirley, ma'am.  I wouldn't know who he meant if he  did.  Of course, when we got married he had to say, 'I take thee,  Leonora,' and I declare to you, Miss Shirley, ma'am, I've had the most  dreadful feeling ever since that it wasn't me he was talking to and I  haven't been rightly married at all.

In the earliest ages even he is     prominent in the nether world. He conducts the mummifying process,     preserves the corpse, guards the Necropolis, and, as Hermes     Psychopompos (Hermanubis), opens the way for the souls. According     to Plutarch \"He is the watch of the gods as the dog is the watch of     men.\"]    The remnants of the meat offerings from the altars were consumed by  them; to the perfect satisfaction of the devotees, who, when they found  that by the following day the meat had disappeared, believed that it had  been accepted and taken away by the spirits of the underworld.    They also did the duty of trusty watchers, for they were a dangerous foe  for any intruder who, under the shadow of the night, might attempt to  violate a grave.    Thus--on that summer evening of the year 1352 B.C., when we invite the  reader to accompany us to the Necropolis of Thebes--after the priests'  hymn had died away, all was still in the City of the Dead.    The soldiers on guard were already returning from their first round when  suddenly, on the north side of the Necropolis, a dog barked loudly; soon  a second took up the cry, a third, a fourth. The captain of the watch  called to his men to halt, and, as the cry of the dogs spread and grew  louder every minute, commanded them to march towards the north.    The little troop had reached the high dyke which divided the west bank  of the Nile from a branch canal, and looked from thence over the plain  as far as the river and to the north of the Necropolis. Once more  the word to \"halt\" was given, and as the guard perceived the glare  of torches in the direction where the dogs were barking loudest, they  hurried forward and came up with the author of the disturbance near  the Pylon of the temple erected by Seti I., the deceased father of the  reigning King Rameses II.       [The two pyramidal towers joined by a gateway which formed the     entrance to an Egyptian temple were called the Pylon.]    The moon was up, and her pale light flooded the stately structure, while  the walls glowed with the ruddy smoky light of the torches which flared  in the hands of black attendants.    A man of sturdy build, in sumptuous dress, was knocking at the  brass-covered temple door with the metal handle of a whip, so violently  that the blows rang far and loud through the night. Near him stood a  litter, and a chariot, to which were harnessed two fine horses. In the  litter sat a young woman, and in the carriage, next to the driver, was  the tall figure of a lady. Several men of the upper classes and many  servants stood around the litter and the chariot. Few words were  exchanged; the whole attention of the strangely lighted groups seemed  concentrated on the temple-gate. The darkness concealed the features  of individuals, but the mingled light of the moon and the torches was  enough to reveal to the gate-keeper, who looked down on the party from a  tower of the Pylon, that it was composed of persons of the highest rank;  nay, perhaps of the royal family.    He called aloud to the one who knocked, and asked him what was his will.    He looked up, and in a voice so rough and imperious, that the lady in  the litter shrank in horror as its tones suddenly violated the place of  the dead, he cried out--\"How long are we to wait here for you--you  dirty hound? Come down and open the door and then ask questions. If  the torch-light is not bright enough to show you who is waiting, I will  score our name on your shoulders with my whip, and teach you how to  receive princely visitors.\"    While the porter muttered an unintelligible answer and came down the  steps within to open the door, the lady in the chariot turned to her  impatient companion and said in a pleasant but yet decided voice, \"You  forget, Paaker, that you are back again in Egypt, and that here you have  to deal not with the wild Schasu,--[A Semitic race of robbers in the  cast of Egypt.]--but with friendly priests of whom we have to solicit  a favor. We have always had to lament your roughness, which seems to  me very ill-suited to the unusual circumstances under which we approach  this sanctuary.\"    Although these words were spoken in a tone rather of regret than of  blame, they wounded the sensibilities of the person addressed; his wide  nostrils began to twitch ominously, he clenched his right hand over the  handle of his whip, and, while he seemed to be bowing humbly, he struck  such a heavy blow on the bare leg of a slave who was standing near  to him, an old Ethiopian, that he shuddered as if from sudden cold,  though-knowing his lord only too well--he let no cry of pain escape him.  Meanwhile the gate-keeper had opened the door, and with him a tall young  priest stepped out into the open air to ask the will of the intruders.    Paaker would have seized the opportunity of speaking, but the lady in  the chariot interposed and said:    \"I am Bent-Anat, the daughter of the King, and this lady in the litter  is Nefert, the wife of the noble Mena, the charioteer of my father. We  were going in company with these gentlemen to the north-west valley of  the Necropolis to see the new works there. You know the narrow pass in  the rocks which leads up the gorge. On the way home I myself held the  reins and I had the misfortune to drive over a girl who sat by the road  with a basket full of flowers, and to hurt her--to hurt her very badly  I am afraid. The wife of Mena with her own hands bound up the child, and  then she carried her to her father's house--he is a paraschites--[One  who opened the bodies of the dead to prepare them for being  embalmed.]--Pinem is his name. I know not whether he is known to you.\"    \"Thou hast been into his house, Princess?\"    \"Indeed, I was obliged, holy father,\" she replied, \"I know of course  that I have defiled myself by crossing the threshold of these people,  but--\"    \"But,\" cried the wife of Mena, raising herself in her litter, \"Bent-Anat  can in a day be purified by thee or by her house-priest, while she can  hardly--or perhaps never--restore the child whole and sound again to the  unhappy father.\"    \"Still, the den of a paraschites is above every thing unclean,\" said  the chamberlain Penbesa, master of the ceremonies to the princess,  interrupting the wife of Mena, \"and I did not conceal my opinion when  Bent-Anat announced her intention of visiting the accursed hole in  person. I suggested,\" he continued, turning to the priest, \"that she  should let the girl be taken home, and send a royal present to the  father.\"    \"And the princess?\" asked the priest.    \"She acted, as she always does, on her own judgment,\" replied the master  of the ceremonies.    \"And that always hits on the right course,\" cried the wife of Mena.    \"Would to God it were so!\" said the princess in a subdued voice. Then  she continued, addressing the priest, \"Thou knowest the will of the Gods  and the hearts of men, holy father, and I myself know that I give alms  willingly and help the poor even when there is none to plead for them  but their poverty. But after what has occurred here, and to these  unhappy people, it is I who come as a suppliant.\"    \"Thou?\" said the chamberlain.    \"I,\" answered the princess with decision. The priest who up to this  moment had remained a silent witness of the scene raised his right hand  as in blessing and spoke.    \"Thou hast done well. The Hathors fashioned thy heart and the Lady of  Truth guides it. Thou hast broken in on our night-prayers to request us  to send a doctor to the injured girl?\"       [Hathor was Isis under a substantial form. She is the goddess of     the pure, light heaven, and bears the Sun-disk between cow-horns on     a cow's head or on a human head with cow's ears. She was named the     Fair, and all the pure joys of life are in her gift. Later she was     regarded as a Muse who beautifies life with enjoyment, love, song,     and the dance. She appears as a good fairy by the cradle of     children and decides their lot in life. She bears many names: and     several, generally seven, Hathors were represented, who personified     the attributes and influence of the goddess.]    \"Thou hast said.\"    \"I will ask the high-priest to send the best leech for outward wounds  immediately to the child. But where is the house of the paraschites  Pinem? I do not know it.\"    \"Northwards from the terrace of Hatasu,--[A great queen of the 18th  dynasty and guardian of two Pharaohs]--close to--; but I will charge one  of my attendants to conduct the leech. Besides, I want to know early in  the morning how the child is doing.--Paaker.\"    The rough visitor, whom we already know, thus called upon, bowed to the  earth, his arms hanging by his sides, and asked:    \"What dost thou command?\"    \"I appoint you guide to the physician,\" said the princess. \"It will be  easy to the king's pioneer to find the little half-hidden house again--       [The title here rendered pioneer was that of an officer whose duties     were those at once of a scout and of a Quarter-Master General. In     unknown and comparatively savage countries it was an onerous post.     --Translator.]    besides, you share my guilt, for,\" she added, turning to the priest, \"I  confess that the misfortune happened because I would try with my horses  to overtake Paaker's Syrian racers, which he declared to be swifter than  the Egyptian horses. It was a mad race.\"    \"And Amon be praised that it ended as it did,\" exclaimed the master of  the ceremonies. \"Packer's chariot lies dashed in pieces in the valley,  and his best horse is badly hurt.\"    \"He will see to him when he has taken the physician to the house of the  paraschites,\" said the princess. \"Dost thou know, Penbesa--thou anxious  guardian of a thoughtless girl--that to-day for the first time I am glad  that my father is at the war in distant Satiland?\"--[Asia].    \"He would not have welcomed us kindly!\" said the"]]]
