That was the priest's voice in the room above.  He may forget it. Those last sacraments  May set his mind at rest, and bring him peace.\"--  Then, stealing quietly to that upper door,  They opened it a little, and saw within  The lean white deathbed of Copernicus  Who made our world a world without an end.  There, in that narrow room, they saw his face  Grey, seamed with thought, lit by a single lamp;  They saw those glorious eyes  Closing, that once had looked beyond the spheres  And seen our ancient firmaments dissolve  Into a boundless night.                          Beside him knelt  Two women, like bowed shadows. At his feet,  An old physician watched him. At his head,  The cowled Franciscan murmured, while the light  Shone faintly on the chalice.                                All grew still.  The fragrance of the wine was like faint flowers,  The first breath of those far celestial fields....    Then, like a dying soldier, that must leave  His last command to others, while the fight  Is yet uncertain, and the victory far,  Copernicus whispered, in a fevered dream,  \"Yes, it is Death. But you must hold him back,  There, in the doorway, for a little while,  Until I know the work is rightly done.  Use all your weapons, doctor. I must live  To see and touch one copy of my book.  Have they not brought it yet?                                They promised me  It should be here by nightfall.                                  One of you go  And hasten it. I can hold back  Death till dawn.    Have they not brought it yet?--from Nuremberg.  Do not deceive me. I must know it safe,  Printed and safe, for other men to use.  I could die then. My use would be fulfilled.  What has delayed them? Will not some one go  And tell them that my strength is running out?  Tell them that book would be an angel's hand  In mine, an easier pillow for my head,  A little lantern in the engulfing dark.  You see, I hid its struggling light so long  Under too small a bushel, and I fear  It may go out forever. In the noon  Of life's brief day, I could not see the need  As now I see it, when the night shuts down.  I was afraid, perhaps, it might confuse  The lights that guide us for the souls of men.    But now I see three stages in our life.  At first, we bask contented in our sun  And take what daylight shows us for the truth.  Then we discover, in some midnight grief,  How all day long the sunlight blinded us  To depths beyond, where all our knowledge dies.  That's where men shrink, and lose their way in doubt.  Then, last, as death draws nearer, comes a night  In whose majestic shadow men see God,  Absolute Knowledge, reconciling all.  So, all my life I pondered on that scheme  Which makes this earth the centre of all worlds,  Lighted and wheeled around by sun and moon  And that great crystal sphere wherein men thought  Myriads of lesser stars were fixed like lamps,  Each in its place,--one mighty glittering wheel  Revolving round this dark abode of man.  Night after night, with even pace they moved.  Year after year, not altering by one point,  Their order, or their stations, those fixed stars  In that revolving firmament. The Plough  Still pointed to the Pole. Fixed in their sphere,  How else explain that vast unchanging wheel?  How, but by thinking all those lesser lights  Were huger suns, divided from our earth  By so immense a gulf that, if they moved  Ten thousand leagues an hour among themselves,  It would not seem one hair's-breadth to our eyes.  Utterly inconceivable, I know;  And yet we daily kneel to boundless Power  And build our hope on that Infinitude.    This did not daunt me, then. Indeed, I saw  Light upon chaos. Many discordant dreams  Began to move in lucid music now.  For what could be more baffling than the thought  That those enormous heavens must circle earth  Diurnally--a journey that would need  Swiftness to which the lightning flash would seem  A white slug creeping on the walls of night;  While, if earth softly on her axle spun  One quiet revolution answered all.  It was our moving selves that made the sky  Seem to revolve. Have not all ages seen  A like illusion baffling half mankind  In life, thought, art? Men think, at every turn  Of their own souls, the very heavens have moved.    Light upon chaos, light, and yet more light;  For--as I watched the planets--Venus, Mars,  Appeared to wax and wane from month to month  As though they moved, now near, now far, from earth.  Earth could not be their centre. Was the sun  Their sovran lord then, as Pythagoras held?  Was this great earth, so 'stablished, so secure,  A planet also? Did it also move  Around the sun? If this were true, my friends,  No revolution in this world's affairs,  Not that blind maelstrom where imperial Rome  Went down into the dark, could so engulf  All that we thought we knew. We who believed  In our own majesty, we who walked with gods  As younger sons on this proud central stage,  Round which the whole bright firmament revolved  For our especial glory, must we creep  Like ants upon our midget ball of dust  Lost in immensity?                     I could not take  That darkness lightly. I withheld my book  For many a year, until I clearly saw,  And Rome approved me--have they not brought it yet?--  That this tremendous music could not drown  The still supernal music of the soul,  Or quench the light that shone when Christ was born.  For who, if one lost star could lead the kings  To God's own Son, would shrink from following these  To His eternal throne?                         This at the least  We know, the soul of man can soar through heaven.  It is our own wild wings that dwarf the world  To nothingness beneath us. Let the soul  Take courage, then. If its own thought be true,  Not all the immensities of little minds  Can ever quench its own celestial fire.  No. This new night was needed, that the soul  Might conquer its own kingdom and arise  To its full stature. So, in face of death,  I saw that I must speak the truth I knew.    Have they not brought it? What delays my book?  I am afraid. Tell me the truth, my friends.  At this last hour, the Church may yet withhold  Her sanction. Not the Church, but those who think  A little darkness helps her.                               Were this true,  They would do well. If the poor light we win  Confuse or blind us, to the Light of lights,  Let all our wisdom perish. I affirm  A greater Darkness, where the one true Church  Shall after all her agonies of loss  And many an age of doubt, perhaps, to come,  See this processional host of splendours burn  Like tapers round her altar.                               So I speak  Not for myself, but for the age unborn.  I caught the fire from those who went before,  The bearers of the torch who could not see  The goal to which they strained. I caught their fire,  And carried it, only a little way beyond;  But there are those that wait for it, I know,  Those who will carry it on to victory.  I dare not fail them. Looking back, I see  Those others,--fallen, with their arms outstretched  Dead, pointing to the future.                                Far, far back,  Before the Egyptians built their pyramids  With those dark funnels pointing to the north,  Through which the Pharaohs from their desert tombs  Gaze all night long upon the Polar Star,  Some wandering Arab crept from death to life  Led by the Plough across those wastes of pearl....    Long, long ago--have they not brought it yet?  My book?--I finished it one summer's night,  And felt my blood all beating into song.  I meant to print those verses in my book,  A prelude, hinting at that deeper night  Which darkens all our knowledge. Then I thought  The measure moved too lightly.                                 Do you recall  Those verses, Elsa? They would pass the time.  How happy I was the night I wrote that song!\"  Then, one of those bowed shadows raised her head  And, like a mother crooning to her child,  Murmured the words he wrote, so long ago.    In old Cathay, in far Cathay,    Before the western world began,  They saw the moving fount of day    Eclipsed, as by a shadowy fan;  They stood upon their Chinese wall.    They saw his fire to ashes fade,  And felt the deeper slumber fall    On domes of pearl and towers of jade.    With slim brown hands, in Araby,    They traced, upon the desert sand,  Their Rams and Scorpions of the sky,    And strove--and failed--to understand.  Before their footprints were effaced    The shifting sand forgot their rune;  Their hieroglyphs were all erased,    Their desert naked to the moon.    In Bagdad of the purple nights,    Haroun Al Raschid built a tower,  Where sages watched a thousand lights    And read their legends, for an hour.  The tower is down, the Caliph dead,    Their astrolabes are wrecked with rust.  Orion glitters overhead,    Aladdin's lamp is in the dust.    In Babylon, in Babylon,    They baked their tablets of the clay;  And, year by year, inscribed thereon    The dark eclipses of their day;  They saw the moving finger write    Its _Mene, Mene_, on their sun.  A mightier shadow cloaks their light,    And clay is clay in Babylon.    A shadow moved towards him from the door.  Copernicus, with a cry, upraised his head.  \"The book, I cannot see it, let me feel  The lettering on the cover.                              It is here!  Put out the lamp, now. Draw those curtains back,  And let me die with starlight on my face.  An angel's hand in mine . . . yes; I can say  My _nunc dimittis_ now . . . light, and more light  In that pure realm whose darkness is our peace.\"          II    TYCHO BRAHE      I      They thought him a magician, Tycho Brahe,  Who lived on that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6585"],[0,"The Works of Lucian of Samosata — Volume 02 (#3)"],[1,"ration; everything you see  done throws you into ecstasies. It is all so new and strange! The waiters  stare at you, the company watch your movements. Nor is the host without  curiosity. Some of his servants have instructions to observe you  narrowly, lest your glance should fall too often on his wife or children.  The other guests' men perceive your amazement at the novel scene, and  exchange jesting asides. From the fact that you do not know what to make  of your napkin, they conclude that this is your first experience of  dining-out. You perspire with embarrassment; not unnaturally. You are  thirsty, but you dare not ask for wine, lest you should be thought a  tippler. The due connexion between the various dishes which make their  appearance is beyond you: which ought you to take first? which next?  There is nothing for it but to snatch a side glance at your neighbour, do  as he does, and learn to dine in sequence. On the whole, your feelings  are mingled, your spirit perturbed, and stricken with awe. One moment you  are envying your host his gold, his ivory, and all his magnificence; the  next, you are pitying yourself,--that miserable nonentity which calls its  existence life; and then at intervals comes the thought, 'how happy shall  I be, sharing in these splendours, enjoying them as if they were my own!'  For you conceive of your future life as one continual feast; and the  smiling attendance of gracious Ganymedes gives a charming finish to the  picture. That line of Homer keeps coming to your lips: Small blame to  Trojan or to greaved Achaean, if such happiness as this was to be the  reward of their toils and sufferings. Presently healths are drunk. The  host calls for a large beaker, and drinks to 'the Professor,' or whatever  your title is to be. You, in your innocence, do not know that you ought  to say something in reply; you receive the cup in silence, and are set  down as a boor.    Apart from this, your host's pledge has secured you the enmity of many of  his old friends, with some of whom it was already a grievance, that an  acquaintance of a few hours' standing should sit above men who have been  drinking the cup of slavery for years. Tongues are busy with you at once.  Listen to some of them. 'So! We are to give place to new-comers! It  wanted but this. The gates of Rome are open to none but these Greeks. Now  what is their claim to be set over our heads? I suppose they think they  are conferring a favour on us with their wordy stuff?' 'How he did drink,  to be sure!' says another. 'And did you see how he shovelled his food  down, hand over hand? Mannerless starveling! He has never so much as  dreamt of white bread before. 'Twas the same with the capon and pheasant;  much if he left us the bones to pick!' 'My dear sirs' (cries number  three), 'I give him five days at the outside; after which you will see  him at our end of the table, making like moan with ourselves. He is a new  pair of shoes just now, and is treated with all ceremony. Wait till he  has been worn a few times, and the mud has done its work; he will be  flung under the bed, poor wretch, like the rest of us, to be a receptacle  for bugs.' Such are some among the many comments you excite; and, for all  we know, mischief may be brewing at this moment.    Meanwhile, you are the guest of the evening, and the principal theme of  conversation. Your unwonted situation has led you on to drink more than  was advisable. For some time you have been feeling uncomfortable effects  from your host's light, eager wine. To get up before the rest would be  bad manners: to remain is perilous. The drinking is prolonged; subject  upon subject is started, spectacle after spectacle is produced; for your  host is determined that you shall see all he has to show. You suffer the  torments of the damned. You see nothing of what is going forward: some  favourite singer or musician is performing--you hear him not; and while  you force out some complimentary phrase, you are praying that an  earthquake may swallow up all, or that the news of a fire may break up  the party.    Such, my friend, is your first dinner, the best you will ever get. For my  part, give me a dinner of herbs, with liberty to eat when I will and as  much as I will. I shall spare you the recital of the nocturnal woes that  follow your excess. The next morning, you have to come to terms as to the  amount of your salary, and the times of payment. Appearing in answer to  his summons, you find two or three friends with him. He bids you be  seated, and begins to speak. 'You have now seen the sort of way in which  we live--no ostentation, no fuss; everything quite plain and ordinary.  Now you will consider everything here as your own. It would be a strange  thing, indeed, were I to entrust you with the highest responsibility of  all, the moral guidance of myself and my children'--if there are children  to be taught--'and yet hesitate to place the rest at your disposal.  Something, however, must be settled. I know your moderate, independent  spirit. I quite realize that you come to us from no mercenary motive,  that you are influenced only by the regard and uniform respect which will  be assured to you in this house. Still, as I say, something must be  settled. Now, my dear sir, tell me yourself, what you think right;  remembering that there is something to be expected at the great  festivals; for you will not find me remiss in that respect, though I say  nothing definite at present; and these occasions, as you know, come  pretty frequently in the course of the year. This consideration will no  doubt influence you in settling the amount of your salary; and apart from  that, it sits well on men of culture like yourself, to be above the  thought of money.' Your hopes are blasted at the words, and your proud  spirit is tamed. The dream of the millionaire and landed proprietor fades  away, as you gradually catch his parsimonious drift. Yet you smirk  appreciation of the promise. You are to 'consider everything as your  own'; there, surely, is something solid? 'Tis a draught (did you but know  it)      That wets the lips, but leaves the palate dry.  After an interval of embarrassment, you leave the matter to his decision.  He declines the responsibility, and calls for the intervention of one of  the company: let him name a sum, at once worthy of your acceptance, and  not burdensome to his purse, which has so many more urgent calls upon it.  'Sir,' says this officious old gentleman, who has been a toady from his  youth, 'Sir, you are the luckiest man in Rome. Deny it if you can! You  have gained a privilege which many a man has longed for, and is not like  to obtain at Fortune's hands. You have been admitted to enjoy the company  and share the hearth and home of the first citizen of our empire. Used  aright, such a privilege will be more to you than the wealth of a Croesus  or a Midas. Knowing as I do how many there are--persons of high standing  --who would be glad to pay money down, merely for the honour and glory of  the acquaintanceship, of being seen in his company, and ranking as his  friends and intimates,--knowing this, I am at a loss for words in which  to express my sense of your good fortune. You are not only to enjoy this  happiness, but to be paid for enjoying it! Under the circumstances, I  think we shall satisfy your most extravagant expectations, if we say'--  and he names a sum which in itself is of the smallest, quite apart from  all reference to your brilliant hopes. However, there is nothing for it  but to submit with a good grace. It is too late now for escape; you are  in the toils. So you open your mouth for the bit, and are very manageable  from the first. You give your rider no occasion to keep a tight rein, or  to use the spur; and at last by imperceptible degrees you are quite  broken in to him.    The outside world from that time watches you with envy. You dwell within  his courts; you have free access; you are become a person of consequence.  Yet it is now incomprehensible to you how they can suppose you to be  happy. At the same time, you are not without a certain exultation: you  cheat yourself from day to day with the thought that there are better  things to come. Quite the contrary turns out to be the case. Your  prospects, like the proverbial sacrifice of Mandrobulus, dwindle and  contract from day to day. Gradually you get some faint glimmerings of the  truth. It begins to dawn upon you at last, that those golden hopes were  neither more nor less than gilded bubbles: the vexations, on the other  hand, are realities; solid, abiding, uncompromising realities. 'And what  are these vexations?' you will perhaps exclaim; 'I see nothing so  vexatious about the matter; I know not what are the hardships and the  drudgery alluded to.' Then listen. And do not confine yourself to the  article of drudgery, but keep a sharp look-out for ignominy, for  degradation, for everything, in short, that is unworthy of a free man.    Let me remind you then, to begin with, that you are no longer free-born,  no longer a man of family. Birth, freedom, ancestry, all these you will  leave on the other side of the door, when you enter upon the fulfilment  of your servile contract; for Freedom will never bear you company in that  ignoble station. You are a slave, wince as you may at the word; and, be  assured, a slave of many masters; a downward-looking drudge, from morning  till night      serving for sorry wage.    Then again, you are a backward pupil: Servitude was not the nurse of your  childhood; you are getting on in years when she takes you in hand;  accordingly, you will do her little credit, and give little satisfaction  to your lord. Recollections of Freedom will exercise their demoralizing  influence upon you, causing you to jib at times, and you will make  villanous work of your new profession. Or will your aspirations after  Freedom be satisfied, perhaps, with the thought, that you "]]]
