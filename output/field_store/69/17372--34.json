Perceiving he had miscalculated he set to work to retrieve  his error and, during the course of the evening, learnt many things but  not how to make Sabina change her mind. The poor man, desperately  afraid, did all he knew.  He entreated and she smiled, he blustered and  she laughed, he cajoled and she warmed to him but, though she warmed,  she did not weaken.  Her first word was her last: \"'Tis no good for 'ee  to think anything about it.\"    Byron was helpless.  He could not win her to his will, neither could he  break her.  She was capable, as she let him see, of separating from him.  If he appealed to the hinds, they would side with her.  Her cousins at  Hember and St. Cadic, the neighbours in the adjacent valleys, would take  her part.    Turning the matter over, however, he perceived that time, by giving  Sabina fresh interests, fresh cares, might prove his friend.  Nurslings  tie the mother to the house and when the babies came his wife would have  her hands full.  She must let go what she could not hold; and he would  be ready to pick up, bit by bit, what she let fall.    In this hope he settled to his new life.  It was unthinkable that he  should attempt to farm Higher Polnevas, when his mind was filled with  Wastralls.  Of a brooding nature, through which at times flames of  emotion broke, he was content to spend his days thinking out and  dwelling on the changes he would make when his opportunity came.  Sabina's farming, cautious and well-considered, chafed him.  He wanted  the land to bring forth a hundredfold where she now gave a mere return.  He was her lover asking of her all that she could give, eager only to  have the exploiting of her possibilities.  To make her fruitful was to  be his work.  He saw the seed swell in her bosom, the silent marvel of  growth, the harvest that should reward his husbandry; and, because out  of the heart the mouth speaketh, when he talked it was of intensive  farming, of the money that lay in sugar-beet, strawberries, asparagus,  of market-gardening and the use of glass.  Thereby he damaged his cause;  for Sabina, listening, came to the conclusion that she had married an  unpractical dreamer.  If he believed in his theories why did he not rent  land and prove them?  That he only talked, satisfied her that she had  been right in her refusal to let him farm Wastralls and her grip on the  land tightened.  The kindly fields deserved better of her than that she  should put them at the mercy of a dreamer.    Whether or no the man's life that she led did her disservice, it is  certain that no children came to modify the situation.  In the loft, the  carved wooden cradle lay with only the wind to set it a-rock; below, the  rooms were as empty of new life as is a whispering conch.  The bustle of  the farm was like the swish of water about a rock islet, that little  spot of sterility and stagnation at the heart of multitudinous life.  Sabina, who had natural instincts, who had mothered a bibulous father  and many a bit of life from the fields and hedges, was disappointed; but  her feeling was mild compared with that of her husband.  His children  were to have delivered Wastralls into his hand, assuaged at last the  long ache of his passion; but the years turned on their axes, going as  they had come.  At first Byron bore himself with a good courage. After  the unprofitable days of his seafaring it was enough to watch the  tamarisk stems warming into red life, to spend the daylight wandering  over the well-known ground, to return at night to the grey house on its  shelf of rock.  If, after a while, these delights palled, it was because  they led nowhither.    Meanwhile, under Sabina's judicious management, the farm prospered.  Neither cared to spend, the one because she had no wants, the other  because what he desired could not be bought.  With every year the bank  stocking grew heavier, also the man's heart; and every year found his  thoughts fixed more bitterly upon his disappointment.  Sabina saw but  without understanding. Her man was moody, foolish too with his perpetual  harping on his rights, but she was not thereby alienated, for, wise or  unreasonable, he was her man.  Though she envied Tom his houseful of  daughters and Constantine his big sons, her own lack left her the more  leisure to care for her husband's comfort.  The standard of living at  Wastralls was higher than that of the surrounding farms.  Byron ate  according to his fancy and lay soft; was given indeed those things to  which he was indifferent, and denied that after which he hungered.    \"I'm kep' like a prize bullock,\" he said morosely, \"when what I want is  to be workin' and doin' for meself.\"    \"Well, my dear, 'oo told you not to work?  There's plenty to do, there's  that four-acre field, why don't yer go and plough up that, 'stead of in  'ere mumpin' about?\"    \"As though I was yer 'ind?\"    \"What, still wantin' to be maister?\"    \"Iss, an' shall be till I die.\"    \"Now look 'ere.  If you want money to buy Polnevas you can 'av it, but  Wastralls you will never 'av.\"    \"Well, if I can't 'av Wastralls I won't 'av nothing; but you mark my  words\"--he bent towards her and brought one hand with a thump into the  palm of the other--\"if I can't 'av it by 'itch, I will by crook.\"    \"Not so long as I live then, any'ow.\"    Byron was slightly underhung, a formation which gives the face a look of  strength and purpose.  \"We shall see, some day, which of us is the  strongest of the two.\"    The woman, happy in her work and with her main affection satisfied,  could answer with reasonable good-humour: \"Well, my dear feller, 'tis my  land and I must do my duty by it.  'Tis I'm responsible, not you, to the  folks up yonder,\" and a movement of her bright head indicated the  burial-ground at Church Town.  \"I'm sorry you're disappointed, but I  can't 'elp it.\"    \"Oh, hang it--sorry?\"    \"Well, I be sorry.  I'd like for 'ee to 'av everything to make yer  'appy; but Wastralls I can't give.\"  She smiled at him in her friendly  fashion, a sweet inviting smile.  \"I do my best to make it up to yer in  other ways and that you know.\"    \"Iss, I want bread and you do give me a stone.\"  He turned away, leaving  her, as ever, uncomprehending. It was impossible for her to think of him  as other than a child, who for his own sake must be denied and  prevented, who was hers to care for and, in ways that could not harm  him, to indulge.  The truth to her, as to so many of us, would have been  unbelievable.    The break-up of the situation was due to an accident. Sabina had driven  a young horse to the fair at St. Columb Major and this animal, excited  by the unwonted traffic, the smells and the noise, became unmanageable.    Plunging down the hill, he came into collision with a heavy van.  The  prancing feet slipped and he fell, shooting his driver over the shafts.  Though clear of horse and cart, she was flung with considerable violence  against the front wheel of the van.  This startled the van horses and  the heavy lumbersome creatures, with a prodigious clatter, started up  the street.  Sabina, rendered unconscious by the blow she had received,  had fallen between the wheels and the van, lurching forward, passed over  her.    It was thought at first that she was killed but the crushed woman who,  later that afternoon, was admitted to the little hospital at Stowe, was  still breathing.  As the case seemed hopeless, the husband was sent for,  and Byron, in a ferment of excitement, came pounding in on the heels of  the messenger.  His horse was in a lather when he checked him at the  hospital gate.  \"Poor Sabina, poor old girl, it was a terrible thing for  her to die as she lived; away from home like that.  No doubt 'er 'ead  was full of the farmin', never once thought of dyin', but the Lorrd  would be merciful.\"    \"If she's goin' to die, don't 'ee keep it from me,\" he said to Dr.  Derek, who was in charge of the case.  \"I'd rather knaw the worst.\"    \"And,\" as he explained to the neighbours, on his return home, after  being allowed to glance at the unconscious face on the pillow, \"the poor  doctor 'ee couldn't give me no encouragement.\"                                        *CHAPTER II*      The sight of Sabina, her florid face grey against the white bandages,  her pale lips open to facilitate the drawing of difficult breath, had  convinced her husband that she could not possibly recover.  That evening  he called the hinds together, told them what had happened, and for the  first time gave them their orders.  As he went back into the house, old  George Biddick, who had been many years on the farm, and was of a  noticing disposition, drew the attention of a new-come labourer to the  receding figure.    \"Speaks as though 'e'd been maister all the time, don't 'e?  An' carries  'isself pretty straight, too, considerin' as 'e'm bowed wi' grief.\"    \"I don't s'pose 'e realize things yet,\" said Jim, a Rosevear from across  the hills.  \"Must 'av been tarr'ble shock for'n.\"    The other man glanced sideways out of small brown eyes, and gave a  non-committal grunt.  He was queerly shaped, with a high-shouldered  short body and long legs and, being related to most of the cottagers,  was known generally as \"Uncle George!\"    \"Dunno so much about that.  Missus is so strong as a dunkey,\" he said,  as he returned to his work of bedding down the horses, \"an' she may  chate the crows yet.\"    But Jim Rosevear was not listening, his thoughts had run before him up  the road, to where, at the stone stile, a maid would be waiting.  The  rest of the world might be concerned with death; but he was young and  his concern was with life, more life.    When, on the following day, Byron rode over to the hospital, he was told  that his wife still breathed; but that an operation had become  necessary, an operation which it was scarcely"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53372"],[0,"Star of India (#3)"],[1,"  so cold, so polished, so neat, and the enlarged photographs of bygone  Carringtons, framed and hung on the walls, were hideous--all crinolines  and strings of black beads and stove-pipe hats and long whiskers....  Aunt Ellen's room was different; it harboured an apologetic air of  frivolity, imparted by gay little ornaments and a screen covered with  Christmas cards and pictures cut from illustrated papers. Whenever  Stella studied this screen she found something she had never noticed  before. Above all, in one corner stood a cabinet containing drawers full  of birds' eggs and butterflies collected by her father as a boy. Aunt  Ellen was the only person who would answer Stella's eager questions  about her father, and even those answers told her too little--only that  he had gone to India as a very young man, like all the Carringtons; that  he was brave and handsome, that he had died in battle when his little  daughter was about two years old.    And concerning her mother Stella had never succeeded in extracting  definite information.    \"She is dead, my dear,\" was all Aunt Ellen would say with grave reserve,  \"she died when you were born--in India.\" Was there a picture of her? No,  there was no picture. What was she like? We never saw her. What was her  Christian name? It was Stella--and clearly the name itself was not  approved--considered foolish, fantastic.    Indeed the child's periodical questions on the subject of her mother  were torture to the three secretive, old-fashioned women, who shrank  from all remembrance of the shameless being who had bewitched their  \"poor Charles\" and led him astray, dragging the name of Carrington  through the divorce court. At the time of the scandal they had blamed  Charles for marrying the abandoned creature, and when she died, a year  later, they were glad, though she left an unwelcome infant who was  promptly sent home by the widower to The Chestnuts. The child was, of  course, received, but under protest, a protest that vanished when \"poor  Charles\" was killed in a frontier skirmish, a death (for his country)  that in the eyes of his mother and sisters fully atoned for his  backslidings and the disgrace he had brought on a name that had ever  been associated with brave deeds in the East.    India!--the very word held a magic fascination for the child of \"poor  Charles.\" Stella loved the smell of the curios in the drawing-room, and  her \"great treat\" on wet days was permission to open the camphor-wood  chest on the landing; fingering the contents, she would feel almost  intoxicated with the sight and scent of fine muslin veils heavily  embroidered, funny little caps, tinsel-encrusted; a packet of pictures  painted on talc of Indian ladies, black-haired, almond-eyed, smiling,  wonderfully robed. At the bottom of the chest were pistols and daggers,  and swords, all chased and inlaid with ivory and gold; and there was a  carved box full of tiger claws, and silver ornaments, bracelets,  anklets, and necklaces that jingled.... In addition to the camphor-wood  chest there was the lumber room, a low attic that ran the length of the  roof; here were stacks of other interesting relics, horns and moth-eaten  skins of wild animals, hog-spears and clumsy old guns shaped like  trumpets. Also piles of old books and pamphlets, packets of letters and  papers, yellow, crumbling, tied up with string and thrown into cardboard  boxes.    On this luckless Sunday afternoon Stella's mind turned to the lumber  room. As yet she had not the courage to descend and face grandmamma and  the aunts after the scene she had made at the dining-table; and  presently she stole into the passage, that was lined with a wall-paper  depicting Chinese scenes, square bordered, then ran up the ladder-like  stairs leading to the long attic in the roof.    There, poring over old papers and pamphlets and books, she forgot Maud  Verrall and all that young person's advantages, forgot grandmamma and  the aunts, and boiled mutton and her rebellious outburst against her own  \"lot\"--forgot everything but India, the land of elephants and tigers,  tents and palanquins, rajahs and battles, and marvels without end. She  thrilled again as she read of Carringtons who had fought at Plassey and  Paniput, in the Mahratta wars, and before the walls of Seringapatam. A  Carrington had perished in the Black Hole of Calcutta, a Carrington had  been the friend of Warren Hastings, in the Mutiny a Carrington had  performed noble deeds; Carrington women and children had been sacrificed  for the honour of their country....    To-day Stella realised for the first time that her father must have been  the last male Carrington of the line. No more Carrington exploits would  be recorded in the history of British India. The name of Carrington in  the East belonged solely to the past. Why, oh! why--had not she been  born a boy?          CHAPTER II      Maud Verrall threw down her tennis racket; she said she was tired--a  polite excuse for the termination of a game that afforded her no  excitement. Stella Carrington was not a stimulating opponent; if she did  not miss the ball, she sent it sky-high or out of court.    Stella saw through and sympathised with the excuse. \"You see,\" she said  regretfully, \"I have had so little chance of practice. Even if we had a  tennis court at The Chestnuts, there is no one for me to play with.\"    \"Let's go into the Lovers' Walk and talk till tea-time,\" Maud Verrall  suggested; if Stella could not play tennis she might at least prove a  satisfactory recipient of confidences, and Maud had much to impart that  would surely astonish the unsophisticated girl from The Chestnuts.    Arm in arm they strolled up and down the shady retreat arched over with  lilac, laburnum, syringa, while Maud discoursed on the charms of the  latest comic opera that had taken London by storm, and sang snatches of  the songs to her envious companion; from that she went on to tell of  boy-and-girl dances, and bicycling parties, and this led to disclosures  concerning \"desperate\" adorers who were \"perfectly mad\" about Miss  Verrall. There was one in particular--his name was Fred Glossop.    \"Poor dear, he is awfully gone. I feel sorry for him. Would you like to  see his photograph?\" She drew a folding leather case from her pocket and  displayed to the other's interested gaze the portrait of a handsome  youth with curly hair and a distinct shade on his upper lip.    \"Are you going to marry him?\" inquired Stella.    \"Oh! I shan't marry just yet,\" explained Maud. \"I have told him so  frankly. Perhaps in a couple of years, if I meet no one I like better,  he might do. He is quite good looking, and he's going into the Army. I  let him write to me--mother never bothers about my letters; but while I  was still at school he had to write as if he was my dearest  girl-friend--signed himself 'Lily'--because all our correspondence that  was not in the handwriting of parents was opened. I'm to \"come out\" when  we go back to London. I shall make my people give a fancy dress ball.  What do you think of a Greek dress--white, with a key pattern in gold,  and a big peacock feather fan?\"    Stella was ruefully silent. She felt small and humble; there were no  balls, no young men, no \"coming out\" on her dull horizon.    \"And what about you?\" asked Maud with kindly, if belated, interest; \"you  must have a deadly time in this hole all the year round. I'm tired of it  already. How can you stand it?\"    \"I have to stand it!\" said Stella, grimly resigned. \"But I'm going to  school--to a school at Torquay.\"    \"How awful--a horrible place. I went there once after I had measles; and  school, too, at your age! Hasn't the term begun?\"    \"I suppose so, but it does not seem to matter. Anyway, it will be a  change.\"    \"It won't be so bad if they take you to concerts and lectures, and you  go out riding. Our riding master was a picture; lots of the girls were  mad about him; but he liked me best because I didn't take too much  notice of him. Believe me, my dear, men think all the more of you if you  don't run after them. There was a creature always at the lectures we  went to who gazed at me the whole time and used to follow us when we  went out, trying to get near enough to speak to me. The other girls were  frantic with jealousy. Once or twice I gave him the chance of slipping a  note into my hand; it's quite easy--you put your hand behind your back,  like this, and gaze in another direction, and if a governess happens to  be too close, you just speak to her and distract her attention. I only  once got into a row--it was coming away from church.\"...    This line of conversation was pursued whenever Stella was invited to The  Court as company for Maud, and when Maud visited her friend at The  Chestnuts. What, oh! what would have been the feelings of grandmamma and  the aunts could they have overheard such vulgar, pernicious talk? To  women of their type and upbringing this dawning of the most powerful of  all instincts would have seemed a matter for the severest censure--not a  natural symptom to be guided into safe and open channels, but a danger  to be dealt with as sinful, corrupt. Intuitively Stella felt that Maud's  enthralling confidences would be condemned with horror by her relations;  and when Aunt Augusta, vaguely suspicious, inquired one day what the  two young people found to talk about, self-preservation prompted a  careless and misleading reply: \"Oh, I don't know; Maud's school, and all  that sort of thing.\"    Reassured, Aunt Augusta considered this perfectly satisfactory and  natural, seeing that Stella was soon to begin school-life herself.    Maud Verrall's egoistical communications, innocent enough in themselves  (though scarcely to be commended), led, indirectly, after the manner of  trivial happenings, to far-reaching results. One of the immediate  consequences of Stella's newly awakened interest in the opposite sex was  her expulsion from Miss"]]]
