CHAPTER I.    ROME UNDER THE KINGS.      [Sidenote: The Kings found the Roman Institutions.]    I. \"In the birth of societies,\" says Montesquieu, \"it is the chiefs of  the republics who form the institution, and in the sequel it is the  institution which forms the chiefs of the republics.\" And he adds, \"One  of the causes of the prosperity of Rome was the fact that its kings were  all great men. We find nowhere else in history an uninterrupted series  of such statesmen and such military commanders.\"[8]    The story, more or less fabulous, of the foundation of Rome does not  come within the limits of our design; and with no intention of clearing  up whatever degree of fiction these earliest ages of history may  contain, we purpose only to remind our readers that the kings laid the  foundations of those institutions to which Rome owed her greatness, and  so many extraordinary men who astonished the world by their virtues and  exploits.    The kingly power lasted a hundred and forty-four years, and at its fall  Rome had become the most powerful state in Latium. The town was of vast  extent, for, even at that epoch, the seven hills were nearly all  inclosed within a wall protected internally and externally by a  consecrated space called the _Pomoerium_.[9]    This line of inclosure remained long the same, although the increase of  the population had led to the establishment of immense suburbs, which  finally inclosed the Pomoerium itself.[10]    The Roman territory properly so called was circumscribed, but that of  the subjects and allies of Rome was already rather considerable. Some  colonies had been founded. The kings, by a skilful policy, had succeeded  in drawing into their dependence a great number of neighbouring states,  and, when Tarquinius Superbus assembled the Hernici, the Latins, and the  Volsci, for a ceremony destined to seal his alliance with them,  forty-seven different petty states took part in the inauguration of the  temple of Jupiter Latialis.[11]    The foundation of Ostia, by Ancus Martius, at the mouth of the Tiber,  shows that already the political and commercial importance of  facilitating communication with the sea was understood; while the treaty  of commerce concluded with Carthage at the time of the fall of the  kingly power, the details of which are preserved by Polybius, indicates  more extensive foreign relations than we might have supposed.[12]      [Sidenote: Social Organisation.]    II. The Roman social body, which originated probably in ancient  transformations of society, consisted, from the earliest ages, of a  certain number of aggregations, called _gentes_, formed of the families  of the conquerors, and bearing some resemblance to the clans of Scotland  or to the Arabian tribes. The heads of families (_patresfamilias_) and  their members (_patricii_) were united among themselves, not only by  kindred, but also by political and religious ties. Hence arose an  hereditary nobility having for distinctive marks family names, special  costume,[13] and waxen images of their ancestors (_jus imaginum_).    The plebeians, perhaps a race who had been conquered at an earlier  period, were, in regard to the dominant race, in a situation similar to  that of the Anglo-Saxons in regard to the Normans in the eleventh  century of our era, after the invasion of England. They were generally  agriculturists, excluded originally from all military and civil  office.[14]    The patrician families had gathered round them, under the name of  _clients_, either foreigners, or a great portion of the plebeians.  Dionysius of Halicarnassus even pretends that Romulus had required that  each of these last should choose himself a patron.[15] The clients  cultivated the fields and formed part of the family.[16] The relation of  patronage had created such reciprocal obligations as amounted almost to  the ties of kindred. For the patrons, they consisted in giving  assistance to their clients in affairs public and private; and for the  latter, in aiding constantly the patrons with their person and purse,  and in preserving towards them an inviolable fidelity: they could not  cite each other reciprocally in law, or bear witness one against the  other, and it would have been a scandal to see them take different sides  in a political question. It was a state of things which had some  analogy to feudalism; the great protected the little, and the little  paid for protection by rents and services; yet there was this essential  difference, that the clients were not serfs, but free men.    Slavery had long formed one of the constituent parts of society. The  slaves, taken among foreigners and captives,[17] and associated in all  the domestic labours of the family, often received their liberty as a  recompense for their conduct. They were then named _freedmen_, and were  received among the clients of the patron, without sharing in all the  rights of a citizen.[18]    The _gens_ thus consisted of the reunion of patrician families having a  common ancestor; around it was grouped a great number of clients,  freedmen, and slaves. To give an idea of the importance of the _gentes_  in the first ages of Rome, it is only necessary to remind the reader  that towards the year 251, a certain Attus Clausus, afterwards called  Appius Claudius, a Sabine of the town of Regillum, distinguished,  according to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, no less for the splendour of  his birth than for his great wealth, took refuge among the Romans with  his kinsmen, his friends, and his clients, with all their families, to  the number of five thousand men capable of bearing arms.[19] When, in  275, the three hundred Fabii, forming the _gens Fabia_, offered alone  to fight the Veians, they were followed by four thousand clients.[20]  The high class often reckoned, by means of its numerous adherents, on  carrying measures by itself. In 286, the plebeians having refused to  take part in the consular comitia, the patricians, followed by their  clients, elected the consuls;[21] and in 296, a Claudius declared with  pride that the nobility had no need of the plebeians to carry on war  against the Volsci.[22] The families of ancient origin long formed the  state by themselves. To them exclusively the name of _populus_  applied,[23] as that of _plebs_ was given to the plebeians.[24] Indeed,  although in the sequel the word _populus_ took a more extensive  signification, Cicero says that it is to be understood as applying, not  to the universality of the inhabitants, but to a reunion of men  associated by a community of rights and interests.[25]      [Sidenote: Political Organisation.]    III. In a country where war was the principal occupation, the political  organisation must naturally depend on the military organisation. A  single chief had the superior direction, an assembly of men pre-eminent  in importance and age formed the council, while the political rights  belonged only to those who supported the fatigues of war.    The king, elected generally by the assembly of the _gentes_,[26]  commanded the army. Sovereign pontiff, legislator, and judge in all  sacred matters, he dispensed justice[27] in all criminal affairs which  concerned the Republic. He had for insignia a crown of gold and a purple  robe, and for escort twenty-four lictors,[28] some carrying axes  surrounded with rods, others merely rods.[29] At the death of the king,  a magistrate, called _interrex_, was appointed by the Senate to exercise  the royal authority during the five days which intervened before the  nomination of his successor. This office continued, with the same title,  under the Consular Republic, when the absence of the consuls prevented  the holding of the comitia.    The Senate, composed of the richest and most illustrious of the  patricians, to the number at first of a hundred, of two hundred after  the union with the Sabines, and of three hundred after the admission of  the _gentes minores_ under Tarquin, was the council of the ancients,  taking under its jurisdiction the interests of the town, in which were  then concentrated all the interests of the State.    The patricians occupied all offices, supported alone the burden of war,  and consequently had alone the right of voting in the assemblies.    The _gentes_ were themselves divided into three tribes. Each, commanded  by a tribune,[30] was obliged, under Romulus, to furnish a thousand  soldiers (indeed, _miles_ comes from _mille_) and a hundred horsemen  (_celeres_). The tribe was divided into ten curiae; at the head of each  curia was a curion. The three tribes, furnishing three thousand foot  soldiers and three hundred horsemen, formed at first the legion. Their  number was soon doubled by the adjunction of new cities.[31]    The curia, into which a certain number of _gentes_ entered, was then the  basis of the political and military organisation, and hence originated  the name of _Quirites_ to signify the Roman people.    The members of the curia were constituted into religious associations,  having each its assemblies and solemn festivals which established bonds  of affiliation between them. When their assemblies had a political aim,  the votes were taken by head;[32] they decided the question of peace or  war; they nominated the magistrates of the town; and they confirmed or  abrogated the laws.[33]    The appeal to the people,[34] which might annul the judgments of the  magistrates, was nothing more than the appeal to the curia; and it was  by having recourse to it, after having been condemned by the decemvirs,  that the survivor of the three Horatii was saved.    The policy of the kings consisted in blending together the different  races and breaking down the barriers which separated the different  classes. To effect the first of these objects, they divided the lower  class of the people into corporations,[35] and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45464"],[0,"The Mormon Doctrine of Deity: The Roberts-Van Der Donckt Discussion (#3)"],[1,"basis proceeds as a teacher of men. Nay more; he  claims God as his Father. It is not necessary to quote texts in proof  of this statement; the New Testament is replete with declarations  of that character. What may be of more importance for us at the  present moment is to call attention to the fact that God himself also  acknowledged the relationship which Jesus claimed. Most emphatically  did he do so on the memorable occasion of the baptism of Jesus in the  river Jordan. You remember how the scriptures, according to Matthew,  tell us that as Jesus came up out of the water from his baptism, the  heavens were opened, and the Spirit of God descended like a dove upon  him; and at the same moment, out of the stillness came the voice of  God, saying, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\" On  another occasion the Father acknowledges the relationship--at the  transfiguration of Jesus in the mount, in the presence of three of his  apostles, Peter and James and John, and the angels Moses and Elias.  The company was overshadowed by a glorious light, and the voice of  God was heard to say of Jesus, \"This is my beloved Son; hear him.\"  Of this the apostles in subsequent years testified, and we have on  record their testimony. So that the existence of God the Father, and  the relationship of Jesus to him, is most clearly shown in these  scriptures. But Jesus himself claimed to be the Son of God, and in this  connection there is clearly claimed for him divinity, that is to say,  Godship. Let me read to you a direct passage upon that subject; it is  to be found in the gospel according to St. John, and reads as follows:          In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the      Word was God. * * * And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among      us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the inly begotten of      the Father) full of grace and truth.[A]    [Footnote A: John 1.]    The identity between Jesus of Nazareth--\"the Word made flesh\"--and the  \"Word\" that was \"with God from the beginning,\" and that \"was God,\" is  so clear that it cannot possibly be doubted. So the Son is God, as well  as the Father is God. Other evidences go to establish the fact that  Jesus had the Godlike power of creation. In the very passage I have  just read, it is said:          All things were made by him [that is, by the Word, who is Jesus];      and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was      life; and the life was the light of men.[A]    [Footnote A: Verses 3, 4.]    One other scripture of like import, but perhaps even more emphatic than  the foregoing, is that saying of Paul's in the epistle to the Hebrews:          God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past      unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken      unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by      whom also he made the worlds.[A]    [Footnote A: Heb. 1:1-3.]    Not only one world, but many \"worlds,\" for the word is used in the  plural So that we find that the Son of God was God the Father's agent  in the work of creation, and that under the Father's direction he  created many worlds. There can be no question then as to the divinity,  the Godship, of Jesus of Nazareth, since he is not only God the Son,  but God the Creator also--of course under the direction of the Father.    Again, the Holy Ghost is spoken of in the scriptures as God. I think,  perchance, the clearest verification of that statement is to be found  in connection with the circumstance of Ananias and his wife attempting  to deceive the apostles with reference to the price for which they had  sold a certain parcel of land they owned, which price they proposed  putting into the common fund of the Church; but selfishness asserted  itself, and they concluded to lie as to the price of the land, and only  consecrate a part to the common fund It was an attempt to get credit  for a full consecration of what they possessed, on what was a partial  dedication of their goods. They proposed to live a lie, and to tell one  if necessary to cover the lie they proposed to live. When Ananias stood  in the presence of the apostles, Peter put this very pointed question  to him: \"Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost?\" *  * * \"Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.\"[A] To lie to the Holy  Ghost is to lie to God, because the Holy Ghost is God. And frequently  in the Scriptures the Holy Spirit is spoken of in this way.    [Footnote A: Acts 5.]    These three, the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost, it is true, are  spoken of in the most definite manner as being God; but the distinction  of one from the other is also clearly marked in the scriptures. Take  that circumstance to which I have already alluded--the baptism of  Jesus. There we may see the three distinct personalities most clearly.  The Son coming up out of the water from his baptism; the heavens  opening and the Holy Spirit descending upon him; while out of heaven  the voice of God is heard saying, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I  am well pleased.\" Here three Gods are distinctly apparent. They are  seen to be distinct from each other. They appear simultaneously, not as  one, but as three, each one doing a different thing, so that however  completely they may be one in spirit, in purpose, in will, they are  clearly distinct as persons--as individuals.    In several instances in the scriptures these three personages are  accorded equal dignity in the Godhead. An example is found in the  commission which Jesus gave to his disciples after his resurrection,  when he sent them out into the world to preach the gospel to all  nations. He stood in the presence of the eleven, and said:          All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye, therefore      and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,      and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.[A]    [Footnote A: Matt. 28:18-20.]    Each of the three is here given equal dignity in the Godhead. Again, in  the apostolic benediction:          May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the      communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all.    In one particular, at least, Jesus came very nearly exalting the  Holy Ghost to a seeming superiority over the other personages in the  Godhead; for he said:          All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the      blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.      And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man, it shall be      forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it      shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the      world to come.[A]    [Footnote A: Matt. 12:31,32.]    I take it, however, that this seeming superior dignity accorded to  the Holy Ghost by the Son of God, is owing to the nature of the third  personage in the Trinity, and the kind of testimony he can impart unto  the soul of man because of his being a personage of spirit--a testimony  that is better than the seeing of the eye, more sure than the hearing  of the ear, because it is spirit testifying to spirit--soul communing  with soul--it is the soul of God imparting to the soul of man; and if  men, after receiving that Witness from God shall blaspheme against him,  farewell hope of forgiveness for such a sin, in this world or in the  world to come!    These three personages then are of equal dignity in the Godhead,  according to the teachings of the New Testament, which teachings, I  pray you keep in mind, we most heartily accept.    This simple Christian teaching respecting the Godhead, gave birth to  what in ecclesiastical history is called \"The Apostles' Creed.\" A vague  tradition hath it that before the Apostles dispersed to go into the  world to preach the gospel they formulated a creed with respect of the  Church's belief in God. Whether that tradition be true or not, I do not  know, and for matter of that, it makes little difference. Suffice it to  say that the so-called \"Apostles' Creed,\" for two centuries expressed  the faith of the early Christians upon the question of God. It stands  as follows:          I believe in God, the Father, Almighty; and in Jesus Christ, his      only Begotten Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary by the      Holy Ghost, was crucified under Pontius Pilate, buried, arose from      the dead on the third day, ascended to the heavens, and sits at the      right hand of the Father, whence he will come, to judge the living      and the dead; and in the Holy Ghost.    This was the first formulated Christian creed upon the subject of the  Godhead, so far as known; and the ancient saints were content to allow  this expression of their belief to excite their reverence without  arousing their curiosity as to the nature of God. Happy, perhaps,  for this world, certainly it would have contributed to the honor of  ecclesiastical history, had this simple formula of the New Testament  doctrine respecting God been allowed to stand sufficient until it  should please God to raise the curtain yet a little more and give  definite revelation with respect of himself and especially of his own  nature. But this did not satisfy the so-called Christians at the close  of the third and the beginning of the fourth century. By a succession  of most bitter and cruel persecutions, the great, strong characters  among the Christians by that time had been stricken down; and, as some  of our historians record it, only weak and timorous men were left  in the church to grapple with the rising power of \"science, falsely  so-called.\"[A] For a long time the paganization of the Christian  religion had been going on. The men who esteemed themselves to be  philosophers must needs corrupt the simple truth of the \"Apostles'  Creed\" respecting the three persons of the Godhead, by the false  philosophies of the orient, and the idle speculations"]]]
