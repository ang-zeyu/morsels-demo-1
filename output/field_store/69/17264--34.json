The  times were too tense to facilitate imaginative literature, and mere  record of events was more startling and absorbing than fiction.    It was not until Giosue Carducci (1836-1907) entered the arena and dealt  romanticism a blow, and at the same time restored classicism, that  Leopardi had a worthy successor.    To-day there is a Carducci cult in Italy. There are individuals and  groups who have the same kind of reverence for him that they or others  have for Leonardo. There is no praise for him that is too fulsome, no  adulation too great. Admirers like Panzini, Panzacchi, and Papini  ransack dictionaries and archives to find words that will convey their  devotion to him. He was a man who incited the admiration and affection  of those who came personally in contact with him. His was a sturdy  personality, which inspired confidence, generated respect, and mediated  an easy belief in his inspiration. The son of a country doctor, he was  born in a little village in Tuscany in 1836. Thus his childhood and  early youth coincided with those years in which king, pope, and emperor  seemed to vie with one another in crushing independent thought in Italy;  those years in which men dared not write, fearing their words might be  misconstrued, or, writing, were obliged to publish clandestinely. During  these years Carducci's thirst for liberty and freedom, political,  social, and religious, developed, and for a third of a century after he  had reached the age of man he externalized it in moving, majestic,  musical verse, which made known Italy's rights and aspirations, and  encouraged her loyal sons to continue their struggles.    After teaching a few years in the high schools of San Miniato and  Pistoia, during which time he published a selection of religious, moral,  and patriotic juvenile poems entitled \"Juvenilia,\" he went to Bologna.  In 1860 he was called to the chair of Italian literature in the  University of Bologna and soon published \"Giambi ed Epodi\" (\"Iambs and  Epodes\"). In this he preached republican doctrines so openly that he  gave offense to the crown and was suspended from his position, which,  however, he soon regained.    Soon after this he published, under the pseudonym of \"Enotrio Romano,\"  an irreligious or materialistic poem entitled \"Inno a Satana\" (\"A Hymn  to Satan\"), which gave him great popularity. It is an invective against  the church, which through its mysticism and asceticism seeks to suppress  natural impulses and which through its intellectual censorship aims to  stifle scientific investigation. It breathed a spirit of revolt against  tyranny and privilege, especially clerical privilege, which had made  such profound growth in Italy. It inveighed against the efforts of  suppression of human rights and bespoke the culture of human reason. It  is quite impossible to read understandingly the \"Hymn to Satan\" without  a knowledge of mythology and Greek history. Indeed, one of the most  characteristic features of his poem is the wealth of classic allusion.  Agramiania, Adonis, Astarte, Venus, Anadyomene, Cyprus, Heloise, Maro,  Flaccus, Lycoris, Glycera are some of the names that are encountered. It  was not until the publication of his \"Odi barbare\" (\"Barbaric Odes\")  that his stride as an original poet began to be recognized. They called  forth the most vicious criticism and at first sight it would seem that  they must sink beneath the avalanche of disapproval, but in reality  Italy was ready to listen to a message couched in new form. Conventional  rhymes, easily read, easily remembered, were now to give way to rough,  sonorous lines in which rhythm took the place of rhyme and  straight-from-the-shoulder blows took the place of feints and passes.    Carducci met his critics with the \"Ca ira.\" It is the apology of the  French Revolution and especially of the _Convention_. The title of the  sonnets comes from the famous revolutionary song of the reign of terror.  Within a brief time, namely, from 1883 to 1887, when his books entitled  \"New Barbaric Odes\" and \"New Rhymes\" were published, there were few  competent to express an opinion who did not realize that he was Italy's  most learned poet, potent in the art of appreciation, felicitous in  conveying noble sentiments and inspiring thoughts, human in his  sympathies with the simple and the oppressed, a tower of strength, a  pillar of fire. From that period until to-day Carducci's fame as a poet  has steadily gained ground in Italy, so that it is no exaggeration to  say that many accord him the crown worn by Petrarch and Tasso. Those who  fulsomely praise his memory see in him not only a poet but a learned man  who was able to strain classic erudition through his understanding mind  to such effect that the average individual could avail himself of it to  satisfaction and to advantage. They also see in him the noblest work of  God, an honest man.    His students idolized him. When they left the university and returned to  their various spheres of activity they carried his image in their hearts  and sounded his praises with tongue or pen. They made propaganda con  amore. No one is ever approved of universally in any country, probably  least of any in Italy. When Carducci published his \"Alla Regina  d'Italia\" (\"Ode to the Queen of Italy\"), one of his best--simple,  musical, redolent of reverence and affection--he aroused the fury of the  republicans, who called him traitor, and the scorn of the envious, who  called him snob.    In 1891, when he accepted a senatorship of the realm, the students of  the University of Bologna howled and jeered at him, and many of the  former students plucked or tore his image from their hearts. They had  apotheosized the Great Commoner, and they saw in this truckling to  royalty and honors weakness and vanity which they could not believe that  he possessed. Yet in 1896, when he completed thirty-five years of  service at the university, the event was celebrated for three successive  days, and the outpouring of expressions of admiration and gratitude from  colleagues and students, and from heads crowned with laurel and gold,  has scarcely ever been paralleled.    In an autobiographical sketch in the volume of \"Poesie,\" of 1871, he  relates with great detail the way in which he broke from his early  parental teachings and acquired his new literary, political, and  religious feelings. Following his Hellenic instincts, the religious  trend in him was toward the paganism of the ancient Latin forefathers  rather than toward the spirituality that had come in with the infusion  of foreign blood. He rebelled against the passive dependence on the fame  of her great writers, in which Italy had lived in the apathy of a  long-abandoned hope of political independence and achievement. The  livery of the slave and the mask of the courtesan disgusted him. His was  the hope and joy of a nation waking to a new life. He was the poet of  the national mood.    Carducci is little known as a poet in this country. There are many  reasons why his fame has not made headway in Anglo-Saxon countries. In  the first place, he has not been extensively translated, and in the  second place, although the subject of his song was so often liberty, his  lines are so replete with erudite classic illusions that even though he  could be translated he would be found to be hard reading. But more than  all there is probably no poet whose matter loses so much of its music  and its fire by translation as Carducci. Such exquisite verses as the  \"Idylls of the Lowlands,\" \"The Ox,\" \"The Hymn to the Seasons,\" \"To the  Fountains of Clitumnus\" are translatable. It would require a Longfellow  to do it so that they should not be emasculated.    In 1906 he was awarded the Nobel prize for literature and the entire  literary world approved of the reward. Two years previously he had  resigned his professorship, and parliament voted him a pension of twelve  thousand lire a year for life, but it was of short duration, for he died  in 1907.    Mario Rapisardi, to whom a monument has been erected in his native town  of Catania, and who is known best for his tragedy \"Manfredi\" and his  philosophic poem, \"La Palingenesi,\" and \"Poesie religiose,\" was a  ferocious critic of Carducci. In his poem entitled \"Lucifer\" there are  many disparaging allusions to him. Rapisardi was a teacher and a poet,  but a spiritual chameleon: a devout believer, he became a radicalist; a  monarchist, he became a socialist; a romanticist, he became a  classicist. He is one of the best specimens of the old order of poets.  His \"Falling Stars\" and \"The Impenitent\" have a genuine lyric quality,  and such poems as \"To a Fire-fly\" have movement, rhythm, and luminosity  that are impressive.    The only poet that approximated Carducci's stature was Giovanni Pascoli  (1855-1912). Though he was a few years younger, the period of his  literary activity was contemporaneous. When Carducci died, Pascoli  succeeded him for a few years in the University of Bologna. His personal  story appealed tremendously to Italians, and he was of the masses in  appearance and sentiment. After the assassination of his father by an  unknown hand the family suffered great poverty, and as a boy the support  of two younger sisters fell upon him, and like so many of the talented  young men of Italy he accomplished it by teaching school. He was  teaching in the high school of Leghorn in 1892 when he published  \"Myricae,\" upon which to-day his fame rests most securely. His verses  gave him an immediate celebrity, and he was soon made professor of Latin  and Greek in the University of Messina. From there he went to Pisa and  soon afterward to Bologna.    Pascoli has been called the greatest Latin poet after Virgil. Some of  the titles of his volumes are \"Poemetti\" (\"Little Poems\"), \"Poemi  Conviviali\" (\"Convivial Poems\"), \"Odi e Inni\" (\"Odes and Hymns\"), \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41958"],[0,"The Microscope (#3)"],[1,"an angle of  from 35 deg. to 50 deg. without any very sensible errors. It exhibits,  therefore, many of the usual test-objects in a very beautiful manner.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.]    [Illustration: Fig. 6.]    The next step in the improvement of the simple microscope bears more  analogy to the eye-piece. This improvement was made by Mr. Holland,  and it consists (as shown in Fig. 6) in substituting two lenses for  the first in the doublet, and retaining the stop between them and the  third. The first bending, being thus effected by two lenses instead of  one, is accompanied by smaller aberrations, which are therefore more  completely balanced or corrected at the second bending, in the  opposite direction, by the third lens. This combination, though called  a triplet is essentially a doublet, in which the anterior lens is  divided into two. For it must be recollected that the first pair of  lenses merely accomplishes what might have been done, though with less  precision, by one; but the two lenses of the doublet are opposed to  each other; the second diminishing the magnifying power of the first.  The first pair of lenses in the triplet concur in producing a certain  amount of magnifying power, which is diminished in quantity and  corrected as to aberration at the third lens by the change in relation  to the position of the axis which takes place in the pencil between  what is virtually the first and second lens. In this combination the  errors are still further reduced by the close approximation to the  object which causes the refractions to take place near the axis. Thus  the transmission of a still larger angular pencil, namely 65 deg., is  rendered compatible with distinctness, and a more intense image is  presented to the eye.    Every increase in the number of lenses is attended with one drawback,  from the circumstance that a certain portion of light is lost by  reflection and absorption each time that the ray enters a new medium.  This loss bears no sensible proportion to the gain arising from the  increased aperture, which, being as the square of the diameter,  multiplies rapidly; or, if we estimate by the angle of the admitted  pencil, which is more easily ascertained, the intensity will be as the  square of twice the tangent of half the angle. To explain this, let D  B (Fig. 7) represent the diameter of the lens, or of that part of it  which is really employed; C A the perpendicular drawn from its  centre, and A B, A D, the extreme rays of the incident pencil of light  DAB. Then the diameter being 2 C B, the area to which the intensity of  vision is proportional will be (2 C B) squared, and C B is evidently the  tangent of the angle C A B, which is half the angle of the admitted  pencil D A B. Or, if _a_ be used to denote the angular aperture, the  expression for the intensity is (2 tan. 1/2_a_) squared which increases so  rapidly with the increase of _a_ as to make the loss of light by  reflection and absorption of little consequence.    [Illustration: Fig. 7.]    The combination of three lenses approaches, as has been stated, very  close to the object; so close, indeed, as to prevent the use of more  than three; and this constitutes a limit to the improvement of the  simple microscope, for it is called a simple microscope, although  consisting of three lenses, and although a compound microscope may be  made of only three or even two lenses; but the different arrangement  which gives rise to the term compound will be better understood when  that instrument is explained.    Before we proceed to describe the simple microscope and its  appendages, it will be well to explain such other points in reference  to the form and materials of lenses as are most likely to be  interesting.    A very useful form of lens was proposed by Dr. Wollaston, and called  by him the Periscopic lens. It consisted of two hemispherical lenses,  cemented together by their plane faces, having a stop between them to  limit the aperture. A similar proposal was made Mr. Coddington, who,  however, executed the project in a better manner, by cutting a groove  in a whole sphere, and filling the groove with opaque matter. His  lens, which is the well-known Coddington lens, is shown in Fig. 8. It  gives a large field of view, which is equally good in all directions,  as it is evident that the pencils A A and B B pass through under  precisely the same circumstances. Its spherical form has the further  advantage of rendering the position in which it is held of  comparatively little consequence. It is therefore very convenient as  a hand-lens, but its definition is of course not so good as that of a  well-made doublet or achromatic lens.    [Illustration: Fig. 8.]    Another very useful form of doublet was proposed by Sir John Herschel,  chiefly like the Coddington lens, for the sake of a wide field, and  chiefly to be used in the hand. It is shown in Fig. 9; it consists of  a double convex or crossed lens, having the radii of curvature as 1 to  6, and of a plane concave lens whose focal length is to that of the  convex lens as 13 to 5.    Various, indeed innumerable, other forms and combinations of lenses  have been projected, some displaying much ingenuity, but few of any  practical use. In the Catadioptric lenses the light emerges at right  angles from its entering direction, being reflected from a surface cut  at an angle of 45 degrees to the axes of the curved surfaces.    [Illustration: Fig. 9.]    It was at one time hoped, as the precious stones are more refractive  than glass, and as the increased refractive power is unaccompanied by  a correspondent increase in chromatic dispersion, that they would  furnish valuable materials for lenses, inasmuch as the refractions  would be accomplished by shallower curves, and consequently with  diminished spherical aberration. But these hopes were disappointed;  everything that ingenuity and perseverance could accomplish was tried  by Mr. Varley and Mr. Pritchard, under the patronage of Dr. Goring. It  appeared, however, that the great reflective power, the  doubly-refracting property, the color, and the heterogeneous structure  of the jewels which were tried, much more than counterbalanced the  benefits arising from their greater refractive power, and left no  doubt of the superiority of skillfully made glass doublets and  triplets. The idea is now, in fact, abandoned; and the same remark is  applicable to the attempts at constructing fluid lenses, and to the  projects for giving to glass other than spherical surfaces--none of  which have come into extensive use.    By the term _simple_ microscope is meant one in which the object is  viewed directly through a lens or combination of lenses, just as we  have supposed an arrow or an insect to be viewed through a glass held  in the hand. When, however, the magnifying power of the glass is  considerable, in other words, when its focal length is very short, and  its proper distance from its object of consequence equally short, it  requires to be placed at that proper distance with great precision: it  cannot, therefore, be held with sufficient accuracy and steadiness by  the unassisted hand, but must be mounted in a frame having a rack or  screw to move it towards or from another frame or stage which holds  the object. It is then called a microscope, and it is furnished,  according to circumstances, with lenses and mirrors to collect and  reflect the light upon the object, and with other conveniences which  will now be described.    One of the best forms of a stand for a simple microscope is shown in  Fig. 10, where A is a brass pillar screwed to a tripod base; B is a  broad stage for the objects, secured to the stem by screws, whose  milled heads are at C. By means of the large milled head D, a  triangular bar, having a rack, is elevated out of the stem A, carrying  the lens-holder E, which has a horizontal movement in one direction,  by means of a rack worked by the milled head F, and in the other  direction by turning on a circular pin. A concave mirror G reflects  the light upwards through the hole in the stage, and a lens may be  attached to the stage for the purpose of throwing light on an opaque  object, in the same way that the forceps H for holding such objects is  attached. This microscope is peculiarly adapted, by its broad stage  and its general steadiness, for dissecting; and it is rendered more  convenient for this purpose by placing it between two inclined planes  of mahogany, which support the arms and elevate the wrists to the  level of the stage. This apparatus is called the dissecting rest. When  dissecting is not a primary object, a joint may be made at the lower  end of the stem A, to allow the whole to take an inclined position;  and then the spring clips shown upon the stage are useful to retain  the object in its place. Numerous convenient appendages may be made to  accompany such microscopes, which it will be impossible to mention in  detail; the most useful are Mr. Varley's capillary cages for  containing animalculae in water, and parts of aquatic plants; also his  tubes for obtaining and separating such objects, and his phial and  phial-holder for preserving and exhibiting small living specimens of  the Chara, Nitella, and other similar plants, and observing their  circulation. The phial-microscope affords facilities for observing the  operations of minute vegetable and animal life, which will probably  lead to the most interesting discoveries. The recent volumes of the  Transactions of the Society of Arts contain an immense mass of  information of this sort, and to these we refer the reader.    [Illustration: Fig. 10.]    The mode of illuminating objects is one on which we must give some  further information, for the manner in which an object is lighted is  second in importance only to the excellence of the glass through which  it is seen. In investigating any new or unknown specimen, it should be  viewed in turns "]]]
