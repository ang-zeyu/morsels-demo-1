The girl took the handsome box he gave  her and drew the cover, when a spring flew forward, driving into her hand  the poisoned tooth of a snake that had been affixed to it. The venom was  strong, and in a few minutes Lotowana lay dead at her husband's feet.    Though the Egyptian had disappeared into the forest directly on the  acceptance of his treacherous gift, twenty braves set off in pursuit, and  overtaking him on the Kalkberg, they dragged him back to the rock where  father and husband were bewailing the maid's untimely fate. A pile of  fagots was heaped within a few feet of the precipice edge, and tying  their captive on them, they applied the torch, dancing about with cries  of exultation as the shrieks of the wretch echoed from the cliffs. The  dead girl was buried by the mourning tribe, while the ashes of  Norsereddin were left to be blown abroad. On the day of his revenge  Shandaken left his ancient dwelling-place, and his camp-fires never  glimmered afterward on the front of Ontiora.          CONDEMNED TO THE NOOSE    Ralph Sutherland, who, early in the last century, occupied a stone house  a mile from Leeds, in the Catskills, was a man of morose and violent  disposition, whose servant, a Scotch girl, was virtually a slave,  inasmuch as she was bound to work for him without pay until she had  refunded to him her passage-money to this country. Becoming weary of  bondage and of the tempers of her master, the girl ran away. The man set  off in a raging chase, and she had not gone far before Sutherland  overtook her, tied her by the wrists to his horse's tail, and began the  homeward journey. Afterward, he swore that the girl stumbled against the  horse's legs, so frightening the animal that it rushed off madly,  pitching him out of the saddle and dashing the servant to death on rocks  and trees; yet, knowing how ugly-tempered he could be, his neighbors were  better inclined to believe that he had driven the horse into a gallop,  intending to drag the girl for a short distance, as a punishment, and to  rein up before he had done serious mischief. On this supposition he was  arrested, tried, and sentenced to die on the scaffold.    The tricks of circumstantial evidence, together with pleas advanced by  influential relatives of the prisoner, induced the court to delay  sentence until the culprit should be ninety-nine years old, but it was  ordered that, while released on his own recognizance, in the interim, he  should keep a hangman's noose about his neck and show himself before the  judges in Catskill once every year, to prove that he wore his badge of  infamy and kept his crime in mind. This sentence he obeyed, and there  were people living recently who claimed to remember him as he went about  with a silken cord knotted at his throat. He was always alone, he seldom  spoke, his rough, imperious manner had departed. Only when children asked  him what the rope was for were his lips seen to quiver, and then he would  hurry away. After dark his house was avoided, for gossips said that a  shrieking woman passed it nightly, tied at the tail of a giant horse with  fiery eyes and smoking nostrils; that a skeleton in a winding sheet had  been found there; that a curious thing, somewhat like a woman, had been  known to sit on his garden wall, with lights shining from her  finger-tips, uttering unearthly laughter; and that domestic animals  reproached the man by groaning and howling beneath his windows.    These beliefs he knew, yet he neither grieved, nor scorned, nor answered  when he was told of them. Years sped on. Every year deepened his reserve  and loneliness, and some began to whisper that he would take his own way  out of the world, though others answered that men who were born to be  hanged would never be drowned; but a new republic was created; new laws  were made; new judges sat to minister them; so, on Ralph Sutherland's  ninety-ninth birthday anniversary, there were none who would accuse him  or execute sentence. He lived yet another year, dying in 1801. But was it  from habit, or was it in self-punishment and remorse, that he never took  off the cord? for, when he drew his last breath, though it was in his own  house, his throat was still encircled by the hangman's rope.          BIG INDIAN    Intermarriages between white people and red ones in this country were not  uncommon in the days when our ancestors led as rude a life as the  natives, and several places in the Catskills commemorate this fact. Mount  Utsayantha, for example, is named for an Indian woman whose life, with  that of her baby and her white husband, was lost there. For the white men  early found friends among these mountains. As far back as 1663 they  spared Catherine Dubois and her three children, after some rash spirits  had abducted them and carried them to a place on the upper Walkill, to do  them to death; for the captives raised a Huguenot hymn and the hearts of  their captors were softened.    In Esopus Valley lived Winnisook, whose height was seven feet, and who  was known among the white settlers as \"the big Indian.\" He loved a white  girl of the neighborhood, one Gertrude Molyneux, and had asked for her  hand; but while she was willing, the objections of her family were too  strong to be overcome, and she was teased into marriage with Joseph  Bundy, of her own race, instead. She liked the Indian all the better  after that, however, because Bundy proved to be a bad fellow, and  believing that she could be happier among barbarians than among a people  that approved such marriages, she eloped with Winnisook. For a long time  all trace of the runaway couple was lost, but one day the man having gone  down to the plain to steal cattle, it was alleged, was discovered by some  farmers who knew him, and who gave hot chase, coming up with him at the  place now called Big Indian.    Foremost in the chase was Bundy. As he came near to the enemy of his  peace he exclaimed, \"I think the best way to civilize that yellow serpent  is to let daylight into his heart,\" and, drawing his rifle to his  shoulder, he fired. Mortally wounded, yet instinctively seeking refuge,  the giant staggered into the hollow of a pine-tree, where the farmers  lost sight of him. There, however, he was found by Gertrude, bolt  upright, yet dead. The unwedded widow brought her dusky children to the  place and spent the remainder of her days near his grave. Until a few  years ago the tree was still pointed out, but a railroad company has now  covered it with an embankment.          THE BAKER'S DOZEN    Baas [Boss] Volckert Jan Pietersen Van Amsterdam kept a bake-shop in  Albany, and lives in history as the man who invented New Year cakes and  made gingerbread babies in the likeness of his own fat offspring. Good  churchman though he was, the bane of his life was a fear of being  bewitched, and perhaps it was to keep out evil spirits, who might make  one last effort to gain the mastery over him, ere he turned the customary  leaf with the incoming year, that he had primed himself with an extra  glass of spirits on the last night of 1654. His sales had been brisk, and  as he sat in his little shop, meditating comfortably on the gains he  would make when his harmless rivals--the knikkerbakkers (bakers of  marbles)--sent for their usual supply of olie-koeks and mince-pies on the  morrow, he was startled by a sharp rap, and an ugly old woman entered.  \"Give me a dozen New Year's cookies!\" she cried, in a shrill voice.    \"Vell, den, you needn' sbeak so loud. I aind teaf, den.\"    \"A dozen!\" she screamed. \"Give me a dozen. Here are only twelve.\"    \"Vell, den, dwalf is a dozen.\"    \"One more! I want a dozen.\"    \"Vell, den, if you vant anodder, go to de duyvil and ged it.\"    Did the hag take him at his word? She left the shop, and from that time  it seemed as if poor Volckert was bewitched, indeed, for his cakes were  stolen; his bread was so light that it went up the chimney, when it was  not so heavy that it fell through the oven; invisible hands plucked  bricks from that same oven and pelted him until he was blue; his wife  became deaf, his children went unkempt, and his trade went elsewhere.  Thrice the old woman reappeared, and each time was sent anew to the  devil; but at last, in despair, the baker called on Saint Nicolaus to  come and advise him. His call was answered with startling quickness, for,  almost while he was making it, the venerable patron of Dutch feasts stood  before him. The good soul advised the trembling man to be more generous  in his dealings with his fellows, and after a lecture on charity he  vanished, when, lo! the old woman was there in his place.    She repeated her demand for one more cake, and Volckert Jan Pietersen,  etc., gave it, whereupon she exclaimed, \"The spell is broken, and from  this time a dozen is thirteen!\" Taking from the counter a gingerbread  effigy of Saint Nicolaus, she made the astonished Dutchman lay his hand  upon it and swear to give more liberal measure in the future. So, until  thirteen new States arose from the ruins of the colonies,--when the  shrewd Yankees restored the original measure,--thirteen made a baker's  dozen.          THE DEVIL'S DANCE-CHAMBER.    Most storied of our New World rivers is the Hudson. Historic scenes have  been enacted on its shores, and Indian, Dutchman, Briton, and American  have invested it with romance. It had its source, in the red man's fancy,  in a spring of eternal youth; giants and spirits dwelt in its woods and  hills, and before the river-Shatemuc, king of streams, the red men called  it--had broken through the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6622"],[0,"Legends That Every Child Should Know; a Selection of the Great Legends of All (#3)"],[1,"good King Hrothgar. So he had made ready a strong  ship, and with fourteen friends set sail to visit Hrothgar, as he was in  need of help. The good ship flew over the swelling ocean like a bird,  till in due time the voyagers saw shining white cliffs before them. Then  they knew their journey was at an end; they made fast their ship,  grasped their weapons, and thanked God that they had had an easy voyage.    Now the coastguard spied them from a tower. He set off to the shore,  riding on horseback, and brandishing a huge lance.    \"Who are you,\" he cried, \"bearing arms and openly landing here? I am  bound to know from whence you come before you make a step forward.  Listen to my plain words, and hasten to answer me.\" Beowulf made answer  that they came as friends, to rid Hrothgar of his wicked enemy Grendel,  and at that the coastguard led them on to guide them to the King's  palace. Downhill they ran together, with a rushing sound of voices and  armed tread, until they saw the hall shining like gold against the sky.  The guard bade them go straight to it, then, wheeling round on his  horse, he said, \"It is time for me to go. May the Father of All keep you  in safety. For myself, I must guard the coast.\"    The street was paved with stone, and Beowulf's men marched along,  following it to the hall, their armour shining in the sun and clanging  as they went. They reached the terrace, where they set down their broad  shields. Then they seated themselves on the bench, while they stacked  their spears together and made themselves known to the herald. Hrothgar  speedily bade them welcome. They entered the great hall with measured  tread, Beowulf leading the way. His armour shone like a golden net-work,  and his look was high and noble, as he said, \"Hail, O King! To fight  against Grendel single-handed have I come. Grant me this, that I may  have this task alone, I and my little band of men. I know that the  terrible monster despises weapons, and therefore I shall bear neither  sword, nor shield, nor buckler. Hand to hand I will fight the foe, and  death shall come to whomsoever God wills. If death overtakes me, then  will the monster carry away my body to the swamps, so care not for my  body, but send my armour to my King. My fate is in God's hands.\"    Hrothgar loved the youth for his noble words, and bade him and his men  sit down to the table and merrily share the feast, if they had a mind to  do so. As they feasted, a minstrel sang with a clear voice. The Queen,  in cloth of gold, moved down the hall and handed the jewelled cup of  mead to the King and all the warriors, old and young. At the right  moment, with gracious words, she brought it to Beowulf. Full of pride  and high purpose, the youth drank from the splendid cup, and vowed that  he would conquer the enemy or die.    When the sun sank in the west, all the guests arose. The King bade  Beowulf guard the house, and watch for the foe. \"Have courage,\" he said,  \"be watchful, resolve on success. Not a wish of yours shall be left  unfulfilled, if you perform this mighty deed.\"    Then Beowulf lay down to rest in the hall, putting off from him his coat  of mail, helmet, and sword.    Through the dim night Grendel came stealing. All slept in the darkness,  all but one! The door sprang open at the first touch that the monster  gave it. He trod quickly over the paved floor of the hall; his eyes  gleamed as he saw a troop of kinsmen lying together asleep. He laughed  as he reckoned on sucking the life of each one before day broke. He  seized a sleeping warrior, and in a trice had crunched his bones. Then  he stretched out his hand to seize Beowulf on his bed. Quickly did  Beowulf grip his arm; he stood up full length and grappled with him with  all his might, till his fingers cracked as though they would burst.  Never had Grendel felt such a grip; he had a mind to go, but could not.  He roared, and the hall resounded with his yells, as up and down he  raged, with Beowulf holding him in a fast embrace. The benches were  overturned, the timbers of the hall cracked, the beautiful hall was all  but wrecked. Beowulf's men had seized their weapons and thought to hack  Grendel on every side, but no blade could touch him. Still Beowulf held  him by the arm; his shoulder cracked, and he fled, wounded to death,  leaving hand, arm, and shoulder in Beowulf's grasp. Over the moors, into  the darkness, he sped as best he might, and to Beowulf was the victory.    Then, in the morning, many a warrior came from far and near. Riding in  troops, they tracked the monster's path, where he had fled stricken to  death. In a dismal pool he had yielded up his life.    Racing their horses over the green turf, they reached again the paved  street. The golden roof of the palace glittered in the sunlight. The  King stood on the terrace and gave thanks to God. \"I have had much woe,\"  he said, \"but this lad, through God's might, has done the deed that we,  with all our wisdom, could not do. Now I will heartily love you,  Beowulf, as if you were my son. You shall want for nothing in this  world, and your fame shall live forever.\"    The palace was cleansed, the walls hung anew with cloth of gold, the  whole place was made fair and straight, for only the roof had been left  altogether unhurt after the fight.    A merry feast was held. The King brought forth out of his treasures a  banner, helmet, and mail coat. These he gave to Beowolf; but more  wonderful than all was a famous sword handed down to him through the  ages. Then eight horses with golden cheekplates were brought within the  court; one of them was saddled with King Hrothgar's own saddle,  decorated with silver. Hrothgar gave all to Beowulf, bidding him enjoy  them well. To each of Beowulf's men he gave rich gifts. The minstrels  sang; the Queen, beautiful and gracious, bore the cup to the King and  Beowulf. To Beowulf she, too, gave gifts: mantle and bracelets and  collar of gold. \"Use these gifts,\" she said, \"and prosper well! As far  as the sea rolls your name shall be known.\"    Great was the joy of all till evening came. Then the hall was cleared of  benches and strewn with beds. Beowulf, like the King, had his own bower  this night to sleep in. The nobles lay down in the hall, at their heads  they set their shields and placed ready their helmets and their mail  coats. Each slept, ready in an instant to do battle for his lord.    So they sank to rest, little dreaming what deep sorrow was to fall on  them.    Hrothgar's men sank to rest, but death was to be the portion of one.  Grendel the monster was dead, but Grendel's mother still lived. Furious  at the death of her son, she crept to the great hall, and made her way  in, clutched an earl, the King's dearest friend, and crushed him in his  sleep. Great was the uproar, though the terror was less than when  Grendel came. The knights leapt up, sword in hand; the witch hurried to  escape, she wanted to get out with her life.    The aged King felt bitter grief when he heard that his dearest friend  was slain. He sent for Beowulf, who, like the King, had had his own  sleeping bower that night. The youth stood before Hrothgar and hoped  that all was well.    \"Do not ask if things go well,\" said the sorrowing King, \"we have fresh  grief this morning. My dearest friend and noblest knight is slain.  Grendel you yourself destroyed through the strength given you by God,  but another monster has come to avenge his death. I have heard the  country folk say that there were two huge fiends to be seen stalking  over the moors, one like a woman, as near as they could make out, the  other had the form of a man, but was huger far. It was he they called  Grendel. These two haunt a fearful spot, a land of untrodden bogs and  windy cliffs. A waterfall plunges into the blackness below, and twisted  trees with gnarled roots overhang it. An unearthly fire is seen gleaming  there night after night. None can tell the depth of the stream. Even a  stag, hunted to death, will face his foes on the bank rather than plunge  into those waters. It is a fearful spot. You are our only help, dare you  enter this horrible haunt?\"    Quick was Beowulf's answer: \"Sorrow not, O King! Rouse yourself quickly,  and let us track the monster. Each of us must look for death, and he who  has the chance should do mighty deeds before it comes. I promise you  Grendel's kin shall not escape me, if she hide in the depths of the  earth or of the ocean.\"    The King sprang up gladly, and Beowulf and his friends set out. They  passed stony banks and narrow gullies, the haunts of goblins.    Suddenly they saw a clump of gloomy trees, overhanging a dreary pool. A  shudder ran through them, for the pool was blood-red.    All sat down by the edge of the pool, while the horn sounded a cheerful  blast. In the water were monstrous sea-snakes, and on jutting points of  land were dragons and strange beasts: they tumbled away, full of rage,  at the sound of the horn.    One of Beowulf's men took aim at a monster with his arrow, and pierced  him through, so that he swam no more.    Beowulf was making ready for the fight. He covered his body with armour  lest the fiend should clutch him. On his head was a white helmet,  decorated with figures of boars worked in silver. No weapon could hurt  it. His sword was a wonderful treasure, with an edge of iron; it had  never failed any one who had needed it in battle.    \"Be like a father to my men, if I perish,\" said Beowulf to Hrothgar,  \"and send the rich gifts you have given me to my King. He will see that  I had good fortune while life lasted. Either I will win fame, or death  shall take me.\"    He dashed away, plunging headlong into the pool. It took nearly the  whole day before he reached the bottom, and while he was still on his  way the water-witch met him. For a hundred years she had lived in those  depths. She made a grab at him, and caught him in her talons, but his  coat of mail saved him"]]]
