As Beric was alike eager to study and to exercise in arms, he  gained the approval of both his teachers. Julia, the wife of Caius,  a kindly lady, took a great fancy to the boy. \"He will make a fine  man, Caius,\" she said one day when the boy was fourteen years old.  \"See how handsome and strong he is; why, Scipio, the son of the  centurion Metellus, is older by two years, and yet he is less strong  than this young Briton.\"    \"They are a fine race, Julia, though in disposition as fierce as  wild cats, and not to be trusted. But the lad is, as you say, strong  and nimble. I marked him practising with the sword the other day  against Lucinus, who is a stout soldier, and the man had as much  as he could do to hold his own against him. I was surprised myself  to see how well he wielded a sword of full weight, and how active  he was. The contest reminded me of a dog and a wild cat, so nimble  were the boy's springs, and so fierce his attacks. Lucinus fairly  lost his temper at last, and I stopped the fight, for although  they fought with blunted weapons, he might well have injured the  lad badly with a downright cut, and that would have meant trouble  with the Iceni again.\"    \"He is intelligent, too,\" Julia replied. \"Sometimes I have him in  while I am working with the two slave girls, and he will stand for  hours asking me questions about Rome, and about our manners and  customs.\"    \"One is never sure of these tamed wolves,\" Caius said; \"sometimes  they turn out valuable allies and assistants, at other times they  grow into formidable foes, all the more dangerous for what they  have learned of us. However, do with him as you like, Julia; a woman  has a lighter hand than a man, and you are more likely to tame him  than we are. Cneius says that he is very eager to learn, and has  ever a book in his hand when not practising in arms.\"    \"What I like most in him,\" Julia said, \"is that he is very fond of  our little Berenice. The child has taken to him wonderfully, and  of an afternoon, when he has finished with Cneius, she often goes  out with him. Of course old Lucia goes with them. It is funny to  hear them on a wet day, when they cannot go out, talking together--she  telling him stories of Rome and of our kings and consuls,  and he telling her tales of hunting the wolf and wild boar, and  legends of his people, who seem to have been always at war with  someone.\"    After Beric had resided for three years and a half at Camalodunum  a great grief fell on the family of Caius Muro, for the damp airs  from the valley had long affected Julia and she gradually faded and  died. Beric felt the loss very keenly, for she had been uniformly  kind to him. A year later Suetonius and the governor of the colony  decided that as the Sarci had now been quiet for nearly five years,  and as Caius reported that their young chief seemed to have become  thoroughly Romanized, he was permitted to return to his tribe.    The present was his first visit to the colony since he had left it  four months before. His companion, Boduoc, was one of the tribesmen,  a young man six years his senior. He was related to his mother, and  had been his companion in his childish days, teaching him woodcraft,  and to throw the javelin and use the sword. Together, before Beric  went as hostage, they had wandered through the forest and hunted  the wolf and wild boar, and at that time Boduoc had stood in the  relation of an elder brother to Beric. That relation had now much  changed. Although Boduoc was a powerful young man and Beric but a  sturdy stripling, the former was little better than an untutored  savage, and he looked with great respect upon Beric both as his  chief and as possessing knowledge that seemed to him to be amazing.    Hating the Romans blindly he had trembled lest he should find Beric  on his return completely Romanized. He had many times, during the  lad's stay at Camalodunum, carried messages to him there from his  mother, and had sorrowfully shaken his head on his way back through  the forest as he thought of his young chief's surroundings. Beric  had partially adopted the Roman costume, and to hear him talking  and jesting in their own language to the occupants of the mansion,  whose grandeur and appointments filled Boduoc with an almost  superstitious fear, was terrible to him. However, his loyalty to  Beric prevented him from breathing a word in the tribe as to his  fears, and he was delighted to find the young chief return home  in British garb, and to discover that although his views of the  Romans differed widely from his own, he was still British at heart,  and held firmly the opinion that the only hope for the freedom of  Britain was the entire expulsion of the invaders.    He was gratified to find that Beric had become by no means what  he considered effeminate. He was built strongly and massively, as  might be expected from such parents, and was of the true British  type, that had so surprised the Romans at their first coming among  them, possessing great height and muscular power, together with an  activity promoted by constant exercise.    Beric had fallen back upon the customs of his people as thoroughly  as if he had never dwelt in the stately Roman town. He was as ready  as before to undertake the longest hunting expeditions, to sleep  in the forest, to go from sunrise to sunset without breaking his  fast. When not engaged in hunting he practised incessantly hurling  the javelin and other warlike exercises, while of an evening he  frequently related stories of Roman history to any chiefs or other  guests of his mother, on which occasions the humbler followers  would gather thickly in the background, evincing an interest even  greater than that which they felt in the songs and legends of the  bards.    Beric generally chose stories relating to periods when Rome was  hardly pressed by her foes, showing how the intense feeling of  patriotism, and the obstinate determination to resist, in spite of  all dangers, upon the part of the population, and the discipline  and dogged valour of the soldiers, saved her from destruction. He  was cautious to draw no parallel openly to the case of Britain.  He knew that the Romans were made acquainted, by traitors in their  pay, with much that passed among the native tribes, and that at  first they were sure to interest themselves in his proceedings. At  present there could be no thought of a rising, and the slightest  sign of disaffection might bring disaster and ruin upon his tribe.  Only when some unexpected event, some invasion of the rights of  the Britons even more flagrant than those that had hitherto taken  place, should stir the smouldering fire of discontent, and fan it  into a fierce flame of revolt from end to end of Britain, could  success be hoped for.    No Roman could have found fault with Beric's relation of their  prowess or their valour; for he held them up to the admiration  of his hearers. \"No wonder Rome is great and powerful,\" he said,  \"when its people evince so deep a love of country, so resolute  a determination in the face of their enemies, so unconquerable a  spirit when misfortune weighs upon them.\"    To the men he addressed all this was new. It was true that a few  princes and chiefs had visited Rome, occasionally as travellers  desiring to see the centre of her greatness, more often as exiles  driven from Britain by defeat in civil strife, but these had only  brought back great tales of Rome's magnificence, and the Britons  knew nothing of the history of the invaders, and eagerly listened  to the stories that Beric had learned from their books in the course  of his studies. The report of his stories spread so far that visits  were paid to the village of Parta by chiefs and leading men from  other sections of the Iceni to listen to them.    Oratory was among the Britons, as among most primitive tribes,  highly prized and much cultivated. Oral tradition among such peoples  takes the place of books among civilized nations. Story and legend  are handed down from father to son, and the wandering bard is a  most welcome guest. Next only to valour oratory sways and influences  the minds of the people, and a Ulysses had greater influence than  an Ajax. From his earliest childhood Beric had listened to the  stories and legends told by bards in the rough palace of his father,  and his sole schooling before he went to Camalodunum had been  to learn these by heart, and to repeat them with due emphasis and  appropriate gesture. His father had been one of the most eloquent  and influential of the chiefs of the Iceni, and had early impressed  upon him the importance of cultivating the power of speech.    His studies in Roman history, too, had taught him the power  exercised by men with the gift of moving multitudes by their words;  he had learned from books how clearly and distinctly events could  be described by a careful choice of words, and attention to form  and expression, so that almost unconsciously to himself he had  practised the art in his relations of the tales and legends of  British history to Berenice and her mother. Thus, then, the manner  no less than the matter of his recitals of Roman story, gained him a  high estimation among his hearers, and he was already looked upon  as a young chief likely to rise to a very high position among  the Iceni. Among the common herd his glowing laudations of Roman  patriotism, devotion, and sacrifice, caused him to be regarded with  disfavour, and the epithet \"the Roman\" was frequently applied to  him. But the wiser spirits saw the hidden meaning of his stories,  and that, while holding up the Romans as an example, he was endeavouring  to teach how much can be done by patriotism, by a spirit of self  sacrifice, and by unity against a common foe. Parta was also proud  of the congratulations that distinguished chiefs,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7050"],[0,"The Swoop! or, How Clarence Saved England: A Tale of the Great Invasion (#3)"],[1," heroically: \"How many of them are there? I am  usually good for about half a dozen. Are they assassins? I can tackle  any number of assassins.\"    Mr. Seymour Hicks said he hoped they would not hurt George Edwardes.    Mr. George Edwardes said that if they injured Seymour Hicks in any way  he would never smile again.    A writer in _Answers_ pointed out that, if all the invaders in the  country were piled in a heap, they would reach some of the way to the  moon.    Far-seeing men took a gloomy view of the situation. They laid stress on  the fact that this counter-attraction was bound to hit first-class  cricket hard. For some years gates had shown a tendency to fall off,  owing to the growing popularity of golf, tennis, and other games. The  desire to see the invaders as they marched through the country must  draw away thousands who otherwise would have paid their sixpences at  the turnstiles. It was suggested that representations should be made to  the invading generals with a view to inducing them to make a small  charge to sightseers.    In sporting circles the chief interest centered on the race to London.  The papers showed the positions of the various armies each morning in  their Runners and Betting columns; six to four on the Germans was  freely offered, but found no takers.    Considerable interest was displayed in the probable behaviour of the  nine armies when they met. The situation was a curious outcome of the  modern custom of striking a deadly blow before actually declaring war.  Until the moment when the enemy were at her doors, England had imagined  that she was on terms of the most satisfactory friendship with her  neighbours. The foe had taken full advantage of this, and also of the  fact that, owing to a fit of absent-mindedness on the part of the  Government, England had no ships afloat which were not entirely  obsolete. Interviewed on the subject by representatives of the daily  papers, the Government handsomely admitted that it was perhaps in  some ways a silly thing to have done; but, they urged, you could not  think of everything. Besides, they were on the point of laying down a  _Dreadnought_, which would be ready in a very few years. Meanwhile,  the best thing the public could do was to sleep quietly in their beds.  It was Fisher's tip; and Fisher was a smart man.    And all the while the Invaders' Marathon continued.    Who would be the first to reach London?          Chapter 5    THE GERMANS REACH LONDON      The Germans had got off smartly from the mark and were fully justifying  the long odds laid upon them. That master-strategist, Prince Otto of  Saxe-Pfennig, realising that if he wished to reach the Metropolis  quickly he must not go by train, had resolved almost at once to walk.  Though hampered considerably by crowds of rustics who gathered, gaping,  at every point in the line of march, he had made good progress. The  German troops had strict orders to reply to no questions, with the  result that little time was lost in idle chatter, and in a couple of  days it was seen that the army of the Fatherland was bound, barring  accidents, to win comfortably.    The progress of the other forces was slower. The Chinese especially  had undergone great privations, having lost their way near  Llanfairpwlgwnngogogoch, and having been unable to understand the  voluble directions given to them by the various shepherds they  encountered. It was not for nearly a week that they contrived to reach  Chester, where, catching a cheap excursion, they arrived in the  metropolis, hungry and footsore, four days after the last of their  rivals had taken up their station.    The German advance halted on the wooded heights of Tottenham. Here a  camp was pitched and trenches dug.    The march had shown how terrible invasion must of necessity be. With no  wish to be ruthless, the troops of Prince Otto had done grievous  damage. Cricket-pitches had been trampled down, and in many cases even  golf-greens dented by the iron heel of the invader, who rarely, if  ever, replaced the divot. Everywhere they had left ruin and misery in  their train.    With the other armies it was the same story. Through  carefully-preserved woods they had marched, frightening the birds and  driving keepers into fits of nervous prostration. Fishing, owing to  their tramping carelessly through the streams, was at a standstill.  Croquet had been given up in despair.    Near Epping the Russians shot a fox....           *       *       *       *       *    The situation which faced Prince Otto was a delicate one. All his early  training and education had implanted in him the fixed idea that, if he  ever invaded England, he would do it either alone or with the  sympathetic co-operation of allies. He had never faced the problem of  what he should do if there were rivals in the field. Competition is  wholesome, but only within bounds. He could not very well ask the other  nations to withdraw. Nor did he feel inclined to withdraw himself.    \"It all comes of this dashed Swoop of the Vulture business,\" he  grumbled, as he paced before his tent, ever and anon pausing to sweep  the city below him with his glasses. \"I should like to find the fellow  who started the idea! Making me look a fool! Still, it's just as bad  for the others, thank goodness! Well, Poppenheim?\"    Captain von Poppenheim approached and saluted.    \"Please, sir, the men say, 'May they bombard London?'\"    \"Bombard London!\"    \"Yes, sir; it's always done.\"    Prince Otto pulled thoughtfully at his moustache.    \"Bombard London! It seems--and yet--ah, well, they have few pleasures.\"    He stood awhile in meditation. So did Captain von Poppenheim. He kicked  a pebble. So did Captain von Poppenheim--only a smaller pebble.  Discipline is very strict in the German army.    \"Poppenheim.\"    \"Sir?\"    \"Any signs of our--er--competitors?\"    \"Yes, sir; the Russians are coming up on the left flank, sir. They'll  be here in a few hours. Raisuli has been arrested at Purley for  stealing chickens. The army of Bollygolla is about ten miles out. No  news of the field yet, sir.\"    The Prince brooded. Then he spoke, unbosoming himself more freely than  was his wont in conversation with his staff.    \"Between you and me, Pop,\" he cried impulsively, \"I'm dashed sorry we  ever started this dashed silly invading business. We thought ourselves  dashed smart, working in the dark, and giving no sign till the great  pounce, and all that sort of dashed nonsense. Seems to me we've simply  dashed well landed ourselves in the dashed soup.\"    Captain von Poppenheim saluted in sympathetic silence. He and the  prince had been old chums at college. A life-long friendship existed  between them. He would have liked to have expressed adhesion verbally  to his superior officer's remarks. The words \"I don't think\" trembled  on his tongue. But the iron discipline of the German Army gagged him.  He saluted again and clicked his heels.    The Prince recovered himself with a strong effort.    \"You say the Russians will be here shortly?\" he said.    \"In a few hours, sir.\"    \"And the men really wish to bombard London?\"    \"It would be a treat to them, sir.\"    \"Well, well, I suppose if we don't do it, somebody else will. And we  got here first.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Then--\"    An orderly hurried up and saluted.    \"Telegram, sir.\"    Absently the Prince opened it. Then his eyes lit up.    \"Gotterdammerung!\" he said. \"I never thought of that. 'Smash up London  and provide work for unemployed mending it.--GRAYSON,'\" he read.  \"Poppenheim.\"    \"Sir?\"    \"Let the bombardment commence.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And let it continue till the Russians arrive. Then it must stop, or  there will be complications.\"    Captain von Poppenheim saluted, and withdrew.          Chapter 6    THE BOMBARDMENT OF LONDON      Thus was London bombarded. Fortunately it was August, and there was  nobody in town.    Otherwise there might have been loss of life.          Chapter 7    A CONFERENCE OF THE POWERS      The Russians, led by General Vodkakoff, arrived at Hampstead half an  hour after the bombardment had ceased, and the rest of the invaders,  including Raisuli, who had got off on an _alibi_, dropped in at  intervals during the week. By the evening of Saturday, the sixth of  August, even the Chinese had limped to the metropolis. And the question  now was, What was going to happen? England displayed a polite  indifference to the problem. We are essentially a nation of  sight-seers. To us the excitement of staring at the invaders was  enough. Into the complex international problems to which the situation  gave rise it did not occur to us to examine. When you consider that a  crowd of five hundred Londoners will assemble in the space of two  minutes, abandoning entirely all its other business, to watch a  cab-horse that has fallen in the street, it is not surprising that the  spectacle of nine separate and distinct armies in the metropolis left  no room in the British mind for other reflections.    The attraction was beginning to draw people back to London now. They  found that the German shells had had one excellent result, they had  demolished nearly all the London statues. And what might have  conceivably seemed a draw-back, the fact that they had blown great  holes in the wood-paving, passed unnoticed amidst the more extensive  operations of the London County Council.    Taking it for all in all, the German gunners had simply been  beautifying London. The Albert Hall, struck by a merciful shell, had  come down with a run, and was now a heap of picturesque ruins;  Whitefield's Tabernacle was a charred mass; and the burning of the  Royal Academy proved a great comfort to all. At a mass meeting in  Trafalgar Square a hearty vote of thanks was passed, with acclamation,  to Prince Otto.    But if Londoners rejoiced, the invaders were very far from doing so.  The complicated state of foreign politics made it imperative that there  should be"]]]
