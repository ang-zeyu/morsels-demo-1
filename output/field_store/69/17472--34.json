Then it ceased abruptly, for the train had scarcely come  to a standstill when the opening above the door was darkened by a head  and shoulders. The head was surmounted by a bowler, and a pair of  pince-nez gleamed from the shadow.    \"Hullo, I say,\" said the stranger. \"Have you changed carriages, or  what?\"    \"No,\" said Mike.    \"Then, dash it, where's my frightful bag?\"    Life teems with embarrassing situations. This was one of them.    \"The fact is,\" said Mike, \"I chucked it out.\"    \"Chucked it out! what do you mean? When?\"    \"At the last station.\"    The guard blew his whistle, and the other jumped into the carriage.    \"I thought you'd got out there for good,\" explained Mike. \"I'm awfully  sorry.\"    \"Where _is_ the bag?\"    \"On the platform at the last station. It hit a porter.\"    Against his will, for he wished to treat the matter with fitting  solemnity, Mike grinned at the recollection. The look on Porter  Robinson's face as the bag took him in the small of the back had been  funny, though not intentionally so.    The bereaved owner disapproved of this levity; and said as much.    \"Don't _grin_, you little beast,\" he shouted. \"There's nothing to  laugh at. You go chucking bags that don't belong to you out of the  window, and then you have the frightful cheek to grin about it.\"    \"It wasn't that,\" said Mike hurriedly. \"Only the porter looked awfully  funny when it hit him.\"    \"Dash the porter! What's going to happen about my bag? I can't get out  for half a second to buy a magazine without your flinging my things  about the platform. What you want is a frightful kicking.\"    The situation was becoming difficult. But fortunately at this moment  the train stopped once again; and, looking out of the window, Mike saw  a board with East Wobsley upon it in large letters. A moment later  Bob's head appeared in the doorway.    \"Hullo, there you are,\" said Bob.    His eye fell upon Mike's companion.    \"Hullo, Gazeka!\" he exclaimed. \"Where did you spring from? Do you know  my brother? He's coming to Wrykyn this term. By the way, rather lucky  you've met. He's in your house. Firby-Smith's head of Wain's, Mike.\"    Mike gathered that Gazeka and Firby-Smith were one and the same  person. He grinned again. Firby-Smith continued to look ruffled,  though not aggressive.    \"Oh, are you in Wain's?\" he said.    \"I say, Bob,\" said Mike, \"I've made rather an ass of myself.\"    \"Naturally.\"    \"I mean, what happened was this. I chucked Firby-Smith's portmanteau  out of the window, thinking he'd got out, only he hadn't really, and  it's at a station miles back.\"    \"You're a bit of a rotter, aren't you? Had it got your name and  address on it, Gazeka?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Oh, then it's certain to be all right. It's bound to turn up some  time. They'll send it on by the next train, and you'll get it either  to-night or to-morrow.\"    \"Frightful nuisance, all the same. Lots of things in it I wanted.\"    \"Oh, never mind, it's all right. I say, what have you been doing in  the holidays? I didn't know you lived on this line at all.\"    From this point onwards Mike was out of the conversation altogether.  Bob and Firby-Smith talked of Wrykyn, discussing events of the  previous term of which Mike had never heard. Names came into their  conversation which were entirely new to him. He realised that school  politics were being talked, and that contributions from him to the  dialogue were not required. He took up his magazine again, listening  the while. They were discussing Wain's now. The name Wyatt cropped up  with some frequency. Wyatt was apparently something of a character.  Mention was made of rows in which he had played a part in the past.    \"It must be pretty rotten for him,\" said Bob. \"He and Wain never get  on very well, and yet they have to be together, holidays as well as  term. Pretty bad having a step-father at all--I shouldn't care to--and  when your house-master and your step-father are the same man, it's a  bit thick.\"    \"Frightful,\" agreed Firby-Smith.    \"I swear, if I were in Wyatt's place, I should rot about like  anything. It isn't as if he'd anything to look forward to when he  leaves. He told me last term that Wain had got a nomination for him in  some beastly bank, and that he was going into it directly after the  end of this term. Rather rough on a chap like Wyatt. Good cricketer  and footballer, I mean, and all that sort of thing. It's just the sort  of life he'll hate most. Hullo, here we are.\"    Mike looked out of the window. It was Wrykyn at last.          CHAPTER III    MIKE FINDS A FRIENDLY NATIVE      Mike was surprised to find, on alighting, that the platform was  entirely free from Wrykynians. In all the stories he had read the  whole school came back by the same train, and, having smashed in one  another's hats and chaffed the porters, made their way to the school  buildings in a solid column. But here they were alone.    A remark of Bob's to Firby-Smith explained this. \"Can't make out why  none of the fellows came back by this train,\" he said. \"Heaps of them  must come by this line, and it's the only Christian train they run,\"    \"Don't want to get here before the last minute they can possibly  manage. Silly idea. I suppose they think there'd be nothing to do.\"    \"What shall _we_ do?\" said Bob. \"Come and have some tea at  Cook's?\"    \"All right.\"    Bob looked at Mike. There was no disguising the fact that he would be  in the way; but how convey this fact delicately to him?    \"Look here, Mike,\" he said, with a happy inspiration, \"Firby-Smith and  I are just going to get some tea. I think you'd better nip up to the  school. Probably Wain will want to see you, and tell you all about  things, which is your dorm. and so on. See you later,\" he concluded  airily. \"Any one'll tell you the way to the school. Go straight on.  They'll send your luggage on later. So long.\" And his sole prop in  this world of strangers departed, leaving him to find his way for  himself.    There is no subject on which opinions differ so widely as this matter  of finding the way to a place. To the man who knows, it is simplicity  itself. Probably he really does imagine that he goes straight on,  ignoring the fact that for him the choice of three roads, all more or  less straight, has no perplexities. The man who does not know feels as  if he were in a maze.    Mike started out boldly, and lost his way. Go in which direction he  would, he always seemed to arrive at a square with a fountain and an  equestrian statue in its centre. On the fourth repetition of this feat  he stopped in a disheartened way, and looked about him. He was  beginning to feel bitter towards Bob. The man might at least have  shown him where to get some tea.    At this moment a ray of hope shone through the gloom. Crossing the  square was a short, thick-set figure clad in grey flannel trousers, a  blue blazer, and a straw hat with a coloured band. Plainly a  Wrykynian. Mike made for him.    \"Can you tell me the way to the school, please,\" he said.    \"Oh, you're going to the school,\" said the other. He had a pleasant,  square-jawed face, reminiscent of a good-tempered bull-dog, and a pair  of very deep-set grey eyes which somehow put Mike at his ease. There  was something singularly cool and genial about them. He felt that they  saw the humour in things, and that their owner was a person who liked  most people and whom most people liked.    \"You look rather lost,\" said the stranger. \"Been hunting for it long?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mike.    \"Which house do you want?\"    \"Wain's.\"    \"Wain's? Then you've come to the right man this time. What I don't  know about Wain's isn't worth knowing.\"    \"Are you there, too?\"    \"Am I not! Term _and_ holidays. There's no close season for me.\"    \"Oh, are you Wyatt, then?\" asked Mike.    \"Hullo, this is fame. How did you know my name, as the ass in the  detective story always says to the detective, who's seen it in the  lining of his hat? Who's been talking about me?\"    \"I heard my brother saying something about you in the train.\"    \"Who's your brother?\"    \"Jackson. He's in Donaldson's.\"    \"I know. A stout fellow. So you're the newest make of Jackson, latest  model, with all the modern improvements? Are there any more of you?\"    \"Not brothers,\" said Mike.    \"Pity. You can't quite raise a team, then? Are you a sort of young  Tyldesley, too?\"    \"I played a bit at my last school. Only a private school, you know,\"  added Mike modestly.    \"Make any runs? What was your best score?\"    \"Hundred and twenty-three,\" said Mike awkwardly. \"It was only against  kids, you know.\" He was in terror lest he should seem to be bragging.    \"That's pretty useful. Any more centuries?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mike, shuffling.    \"How many?\"    \"Seven altogether. You know, it was really awfully rotten bowling. And  I was a good bit bigger than most of the chaps there. And my pater  always has a pro. down in the Easter holidays, which gave me a bit of  an advantage.\"    \"All the same, seven centuries isn't so dusty against any bowling. We  shall want some batting in the house this term. Look here, I was just  going to have some tea. You come along, too.\"    \"Oh, thanks awfully,\" said Mike. \"My brother and Firby-Smith have gone  to a place called Cook's.\"    \"The old Gazeka? I didn't know he lived in your part of the world.  He's head of Wain's.\"    \"Yes, I know,\" said Mike. \"Why is he called Gazeka?\" he asked after a  pause.    \"Don't you think he looks like one? What did you think of him?\"    \"I didn't speak to him much,\" said Mike cautiously. It is always  delicate work answering a question like this unless one has some sort  of an inkling as to the views of the questioner.    \"He's all right,\" said Wyatt, answering for himself. \"He's got a habit  of talking to one as if he were a prince of the blood dropping a  gracious word to one of the three Small-Heads at the Hippodrome, but  that's his misfortune. We all have our troubles. That's his."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7425"],[0,"The Louisa Alcott Reader: a Supplementary Reader for the Fourth Year of School (#3)"],[1,"carry it out!\" And mamma waltzed the little girl round till her curls  flew wildly in the air, while Nursey laughed as if she would die.    \"Tell me! tell me!\" shrieked Effie. \"No, no; it is a surprise,--a grand  surprise for Christmas day!\" sung mamma, evidently charmed with her  happy thought. \"Now, come to breakfast; for we must work like bees if we  want to play spirits tomorrow. You and Nursey will go out shopping, and  get heaps of things, while I arrange matters behind the scenes.\"    They were running downstairs as mamma spoke, and Effie called out  breathlessly,--    \"It won't be a surprise; for I know you are going to ask some poor  children here, and have a tree or something. It won't be like my dream;  for they had ever so many trees, and more children than we can find  anywhere.\"    \"There will be no tree, no party, no dinner, in this house at all, and  no presents for you. Won't that be a surprise?\" And mamma laughed at  Effie's bewildered face.    \"Do it. I shall like it, I think; and I won't ask any questions, so it  will all burst upon me when the time comes,\" she said; and she ate  her breakfast thoughtfully, for this really would be a new sort of  Christmas.    All that morning Effie trotted after Nursey in and out of shops,  buying dozens of barking dogs, woolly lambs, and squeaking birds; tiny  tea-sets, gay picture-books, mittens and hoods, dolls and candy. Parcel  after parcel was sent home; but when Effie returned she saw no trace of  them, though she peeped everywhere. Nursey chuckled, but wouldn't give  a hint, and went out again in the afternoon with a long list of more  things to buy; while Effie wandered forlornly about the house, missing  the usual merry stir that went before the Christmas dinner and the  evening fun.    As for mamma, she was quite invisible all day, and came in at night so  tired that she could only lie on the sofa to rest, smiling as if some  very pleasant thought made her happy in spite of weariness.    \"Is the surprise going on all right?\" asked Effie, anxiously; for it  seemed an immense time to wait till another evening came.    \"Beautifully! better than I expected; for several of my good friends are  helping, or I couldn't have done it as I wish. I know you will like it,  dear, and long remember this new way of making Christmas merry.\"    Mamma gave her a very tender kiss, and Effie went to bed.           *       *       *       *       *    The next day was a very strange one; for when she woke there was no  stocking to examine, no pile of gifts under her napkin, no one said  \"Merry Christmas!\" to her, and the dinner was just as usual to her.  Mamma vanished again, and Nursey kept wiping her eyes and saying: \"The  dear things! It's the prettiest idea I ever heard of. No one but your  blessed ma could have done it.\"    \"Do stop, Nursey, or I shall go crazy because I don't know the secret!\"  cried Effie, more than once; and she kept her eye on the clock, for at  seven in the evening the surprise was to come off.    The longed-for hour arrived at last, and the child was too excited  to ask questions when Nurse put on her cloak and hood, led her to the  carriage, and they drove away, leaving their house the one dark and  silent one in the row.    \"I feel like the girls in the fairy tales who are led off to strange  places and see fine things,\" said Effie, in a whisper, as they jingled  through the gay streets.    \"Ah, my deary, it _is_ like a fairy tale, I do assure you, and you  _will_ see finer things than most children will tonight. Steady, now,  and do just as I tell you, and don't say one word whatever you see,\"  answered Nursey, quite quivering with excitement as she patted a large  box in her lap, and nodded and laughed with twinkling eyes.    They drove into a dark yard, and Effie was led through a back door to a  little room, where Nurse coolly proceeded to take off not only her cloak  and hood, but her dress and shoes also. Effie stared and bit her lips,  but kept still until out of the box came a little white fur coat and  boots, a wreath of holly leaves and berries, and a candle with a frill  of gold paper round it. A long \"Oh!\" escaped her then; and when she  was dressed and saw herself in the glass, she started back, exclaiming,  \"Why, Nursey, I look like the spirit in my dream!\"    \"So you do; and that's the part you are to play, my pretty! Now whist,  while I blind your eyes and put you in your place.\"    \"Shall I be afraid?\" whispered Effie, full of wonder; for as they went  out she heard the sound of many voices, the tramp of many feet, and,  in spite of the bandage, was sure a great light shone upon her when she  stopped.    \"You needn't be; I shall stand close by, and your ma will be there.\"    After the handkerchief was tied about her eyes, Nurse led Effie up some  steps, and placed her on a high platform, where something like leaves  touched her head, and the soft snap of lamps seemed to fill the air.    Music began as soon as Nurse clapped her hands, the voices outside  sounded nearer, and the tramp was evidently coming up the stairs.    \"Now, my precious, look and see how you and your dear ma have made a  merry Christmas for them that needed it!\"    Off went the bandage; and for a minute Effie really did think she was  asleep again, for she actually stood in \"a grove of Christmas trees,\"  all gay and shining as in her vision. Twelve on a side, in two rows  down the room, stood the little pines, each on its low table; and behind  Effie a taller one rose to the roof, hung with wreaths of popcorn,  apples, oranges, horns of candy, and cakes of all sorts, from sugary  hearts to gingerbread Jumbos. On the smaller trees she saw many of her  own discarded toys and those Nursey bought, as well as heaps that seemed  to have rained down straight from that delightful Christmas country  where she felt as if she was again.    \"How splendid! Who is it for? What is that noise? Where is mamma?\" cried  Effie, pale with pleasure and surprise, as she stood looking down the  brilliant little street from her high place.    Before Nurse could answer, the doors at the lower end flew open, and in  marched twenty-four little blue-gowned orphan girls, singing sweetly,  until amazement changed the song to cries of joy and wonder as the  shining spectacle appeared. While they stood staring with round eyes  at the wilderness of pretty things about them, mamma stepped up beside  Effie, and holding her hand fast to give her courage, told the story of  the dream in a few simple words, ending in this way:--    \"So my little girl wanted to be a Christmas spirit too, and make this  a happy day for those who had not as many pleasures and comforts as she  has. She likes surprises, and we planned this for you all. She shall  play the good fairy, and give each of you something from this tree,  after which every one will find her own name on a small tree, and can  go to enjoy it in her own way. March by, my dears, and let us fill your  hands.\"    Nobody told them to do it, but all the hands were clapped heartily  before a single child stirred; then one by one they came to look up  wonderingly at the pretty giver of the feast as she leaned down to offer  them great yellow oranges, red apples, bunches of grapes, bonbons, and  cakes, till all were gone, and a double row of smiling faces turned  toward her as the children filed back to their places in the orderly way  they had been taught.    Then each was led to her own tree by the good ladies who had helped  mamma with all their hearts; and the happy hubbub that arose would have  satisfied even Santa Claus himself,--shrieks of joy, dances of delight,  laughter and tears (for some tender little things could not bear so much  pleasure at once, and sobbed with mouths full of candy and hands full  of toys). How they ran to show one another the new treasures! how they  peeped and tasted, pulled and pinched, until the air was full of queer  noises, the floor covered with papers, and the little trees left bare of  all but candles!    \"I don't think heaven can be any gooder than this,\" sighed one small  girl, as she looked about her in a blissful maze, holding her full apron  with one hand, while she luxuriously carried sugar-plums to her mouth  with the other.    \"Is that a truly angel up there?\" asked another, fascinated by the  little white figure with the wreath on its shining hair, who in some  mysterious way had been the cause of all this merry-making.    \"I wish I dared to go and kiss her for this splendid party,\" said a lame  child, leaning on her crutch, as she stood near the steps, wondering  how it seemed to sit in a mother's lap, as Effie was doing, while she  watched the happy scene before her.    Effie heard her, and remembering Tiny Tim, ran down and put her arms  about the pale child, kissing the wistful face, as she said sweetly,  \"You may; but mamma deserves the thanks. She did it all; I only dreamed  about it.\"    Lame Katy felt as if \"a truly angel\" was embracing her, and could only  stammer out her thanks, while the other children ran to see the pretty  spirit, and touch her soft dress, until she stood in a crowd of blue  gowns laughing as they held up their gifts for her to see and admire.    Mamma leaned down and whispered one word to the older girls; and  suddenly they all took hands to dance round Effie, singing as they  skipped.    It was a pretty sight, and the ladies found it hard to break up the  happy revel; but it was late for small people, and too much fun is a  mistake. So the girls fell into line, and marched before Effie and mamma  again, to say goodnight with such grateful little faces that the eyes of  those who looked grew dim with tears. Mamma kissed every one; and many  a hungry childish heart felt as if the touch of those tender lips was  their best gift. Effie shook so many small hands that her own tingled;  and when Katy came she pressed a small doll into Effie's hand,  whispering, \"You "]]]
