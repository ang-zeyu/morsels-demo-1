Individually their independence is far better guaranteed  under British than under Dutch Africander forms of government.    But a great help to their seeing and understanding of this will be the  predominance, not the domination, of the English language. In the  schools English history and its modern expansion in the colonies should  be taught. Half of the dislike of England shown in the Republic and  among the people in the United States arises from the teaching of the  school-books, which indoctrinates the young American with the idea that  as all tyranny known to his American fathers was centralised and  expressed in Lord North's Stamp Act and the Tea Duties, so the modern  Britisher must still be imbued with the ideas of Lord North, and  taxation without representation must go hand in hand with British rule.  The young Africander must be taught that we of the old country have  learned our lesson. He must know that each of the British self-governing  colonies is a separate nation in alliance of its own free will with the  mother-land. He must know that even in the wildest dreams of  Africanderism the most separatist of the separatists desired the naval  stations of the Cape to remain one of the chief resorts of the British  fleet. Now that Germany and France have their foot on South African  soil, \"marching\" with the states of the new confederation to be, the  youth of the states must be taught to know our forms of government and  the history of them, so that they may judge if they would rather be  under the German or French flag. To be under any separate new flag would  of course be to court danger from the powerful countries, who could cut  off their trade from the harbours, were it not for the protection  afforded by the British fleets. Union and education are therefore the  passwords to success.    How can we better help these forces than by well-devised emigration? Our  Dutch friends have given us a good example. They imported in the  eighteenth century 5000 children from Amsterdam. They knew what they  were about. That was at a time when horses were sent round in a ring to  tread corn, that the labour of threshing it might be saved. It was a  time when, near the outlying settlements to which the children were  sent, there were lions and elephants to be met with--real live  animals--recognisable by the Noah's ark toys of the children, whose  delight at the sight of the creatures was not always shared by their  parents! How different is all now! For thousands of miles, up and down  the country, life is as safe as in most parishes in England. The only  thing to fear is probably an enraged ostrich, and these can easily, even  on an ostrich farm where the huge birds are reared for their feathers,  be kept out of the children's way. The little ones had a long time of it  on board ship, three months in some cases; and glad they must have been  to see the coast-line rising as they neared the Bay, and the long flat  top of the precipitous Table Mountain, with a white wreath of mist  looking like snow against the delicate blue of the sky, on its rocky  summit level. They were not all kept in the white town at the base of  the beautiful mountain whose ever-changing hues were a delight to them.  The children were wisely distributed, that they might take a liking to  the place where they were trained, and should have a feeling of home  love for the part of the country they would know while yet young. And so  it should be done by us in these later times when we have more need of  the spread of our own tongue and traditions in this great land. Careful  location is indeed necessary, but there are so many good locations,  especially along the south coast, that we need not be too timid or too  dilatory. Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, two good bays to the northward to  which railways must ultimately come--more settlements again along the  coast in temperate regions to the east, are wanted, where latitude 34  shows that no great heat can be feared--these are the \"plums\" for  position. And when you turn the corner of that long stretch of coast  lying along latitude 34, you must look out for higher sites than those  on the sea-beach for the young people. And of these higher sites there  are plenty. If Durban be too relaxing there is Pietermaritzburg inland,  and so of most of the ports and bays. Leaving the coast and going inland  by the railways into the \"Orange\" and Transvaal, we at once meet the  main difficulty of \"location\" in the want of water. The Transvaal seems  like a gigantic turtle-back, and whereas in Australia you may meet with  water if you dig 1500 feet or more, where there is no appearance of it  on the surface, we must wait for such revelations in the Transvaal. The  territories are fed by few good rivers, and these are apt to be either  raging torrents or dry gravel beds. But there are \"fonteins\" in many  places, and there is no reason why a fair sprinkling of girls' and boys'  institutions should not be comfortably located both in Transvaal and  \"Orange,\" where along the river of that name there is a more certain  supply of water. The Vaal is of course the largest stream for irrigation  in the north. Very little has been done to husband the water of any of  the African rivers; and the chief work to be done in matters of material  improvement is the adequate damming and storing of the waters of all the  principal streams. The winter floods, copious and overwhelming, have  been allowed to run to waste. Water and wives must for a long time be  the chief wants of South Africa.    Lucas gives briefly the main features of the country now under our flag.  From the south coast to the Zambesi in the neighbourhood of the Victoria  Falls is 1200 miles. The land rises steadily from the sea as you get  into the Hinterlands, and the mountain ranges run parallel to the sea.  Behind these ranges there is everywhere an elevated plateau, and the  highest plains are in the east. There also the rainfall is the  greatest. \"It is from the south or east that men come into Southern  Africa, not from the west, where stretch the dreary deserts of Damara  and Namaqua Land.\" North of the Karoo Desert the principal places are  well situated for altitude. To the west Kimberley is 4000 feet above the  sea. Bloemfontein, the capital of the Orange State, is higher by 500  feet than is Kimberley. Mafeking has 4200 feet. Pretoria, the capital of  the Transvaal, is the same as Bloemfontein. Johannesburg, though so near  Pretoria, stands at 5600 feet. In the north, Matebele Land has an  average of 2500 feet. It is possible that deep borings may find water in  the new states where there is none at present. These heights are  sufficient to explain how it is that even far to the north of Cape  Colony European settlement may thrive, and children grow up strong and  healthy. But \"location\" is everything.    Now, what has been done to foster immigration and settlement up to the  present? Hardly anything has been done by Government. Sir Harry Smith,  who commanded in the fiercest of the Kaffir wars, and after whose wife  Ladysmith received its name, strongly urged the policy of settling  soldiers in the Colony. Between the Fish and the Keiskamma rivers  \"military villages\" were encouraged, the settlers \"being army pensioners  liable to be called on for the defence of the frontier.\" Then again in  the Queenstown district Governor-General Cathcart proposed to settle two  Swiss Regiments, but his plan was not supported. Then Sir George Grey,  his successor, persuaded the home Government to send out 2300 of the  Foreign Legion, as it was called, recruited for the Crimean War. They  were to be called on for military service, if wanted, during a period of  seven years, and they were to have pay for three years. Each man  received his land free of rent, to become his own at the end of the  seven years, if he had loyally fulfilled his engagements. The Government  of the Cape helped by a grant of money. \"At the beginning of 1857,\" says  Lucas in his _Geography of the British Colonies_, \"the German soldiers  arrived and were settled, some at existing towns or stations, such as  East London and King William's Town, some on selected sites, whose  villages were yet to be built. Distributed through the eastern districts  of the Colony, and through British Kaffraria, they held the lines of  communication, as garrisons attached to, and having an interest in the  soil. The divisional district of Stutterheim still bears the name of the  officer in whose charge the soldiers came, and under whose immediate  guidance they were settled on the land. The chief drawback _to the  scheme was that only a few of the emigrants brought wives with them_.  This defect Sir George Grey sought to remedy by proposing to import a  number of German families to be located with and to supplement the  military settlers. Some were brought over, but the total expenditure  which was contemplated was too large to win the assent of the Imperial  Government, and to subsidise an exclusively German immigration, seemed  to the Secretaries of State less politic than to provide the existing  German settlers with English or Irish wives. The Governor therefore sent  on a thousand of the unmarried soldiers to India, and those who  remained behind developed into Cape Colonists, and fell into line with  the civil population.\"    This experiment has succeeded so well that it is a wonder that it was  not repeated. Considering the enormous disproportion in the old country  between the number of men and the number of women, it would seem a  comparatively simple matter to assist female emigration, especially when  a Colony is young and able to absorb any number sent. Nor need any  Colonial Government Department be alarmed that the worthless will be  sent. There are plenty of useful and excellent women who would be glad  to go. As yet the only woman"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4747"],[0,"The River's End (#3)"],[1,"or, and with his arms resting on the table and his shoulders  sagging Conniston put him through the drill. After that he gave Keith  his worn Service Manual and commanded him to study while he rested.  Keith helped him to his bunk, and for a time after that tried to read  the Service book. But his eyes blurred, and his brain refused to obey.  The agony in the Englishman's low breathing oppressed him with a  physical pain. Keith felt himself choking and rose at last from the  table and went out into the gray, ghostly twilight of the night.    His lungs drank in the ice-tanged air. But it was not cold.  Kwaske-hoo--the change--had come. The air was filled with the tumult of  the last fight of winter against the invasion of spring, and the forces  of winter were crumbling. The earth under Keith's feet trembled in the  mighty throes of their dissolution. He could hear more clearly the roar  and snarl and rending thunder of the great fields of ice as they swept  down with the arctic current into Hudson's Bay. Over him hovered a  strange night. It was not black but a weird and wraith-like gray, and  out of this sepulchral chaos came strange sounds and the moaning of a  wind high up. A little while longer, Keith thought, and the thing would  have driven him mad. Even now he fancied he heard the screaming and  wailing of voices far up under the hidden stars. More than once in the  past months he had listened to the sobbing of little children, the  agony of weeping women, and the taunting of wind voices that were  either tormenting or crying out in a ghoulish triumph; and more than  once in those months he had seen Eskimos--born in that hell but driven  mad in the torture of its long night--rend the clothes from their  bodies and plunge naked out into the pitiless gloom and cold to die.  Conniston would never know how near the final breakdown his brain had  been in that hour when he made him a prisoner. And Keith had not told  him. The man-hunter had saved him from going mad. But Keith had kept  that secret to himself.    Even now he shrank down as a blast of wind shot out of the chaos above  and smote the cabin with a shriek that had in it a peculiarly  penetrating note. And then he squared his shoulders and laughed, and  the yapping of the foxes no longer filled him with a shuddering  torment. Beyond them he was seeing home. God's country! Green forests  and waters spattered with golden sun--things he had almost forgotten;  once more the faces of women who were white. And with those faces he  heard the voice of his people and the song of birds and felt under his  feet the velvety touch of earth that was bathed in the aroma of  flowers. Yes, he had almost forgotten those things. Yesterday they had  been with him only as moldering skeletons--phantasmal  dream-things--because he was going mad, but now they were real, they  were just off there to the south, and he was going to them. He  stretched up his arms, and a cry rose out of his throat. It was of  triumph, of final exaltation. Three years of THAT--and he had lived  through it! Three years of dodging from burrow to burrow, just as  Conniston had said, like a hunted fox; three years of starvation, of  freezing, of loneliness so great that his soul had broken--and now he  was going home!    He turned again to the cabin, and when he entered the pale face of the  dying Englishman greeted him from the dim glow of the yellow light at  the table. And Conniston was smiling in a quizzical, distressed sort of  way, with a hand at his chest. His open watch on the table pointed to  the hour of midnight when the lesson went on.    Still later he heated the muzzle of his revolver in the flame of the  seal-oil.    \"It will hurt, old chap--putting this scar over your eye. But it's got  to be done. I say, won't it be a ripping joke on McDowell?\" Softly he  repeated it, smiling into Keith's eyes. \"A ripping joke--on McDowell!\"          III      Dawn--the dusk of another night--and Keith raised his haggard face from  Conniston's bedside with a woman's sob on his lips. The Englishman had  died as he knew that he would die, game to the last threadbare breath  that came out of his body. For with this last breath he whispered the  words which he had repeated a dozen times before, \"Remember, old chap,  you win or lose the moment McDowell first sets his eyes on you!\" And  then, with a strange kind of sob in his chest, he was gone, and Keith's  eyes were blinded by the miracle of a hot flood of tears, and there  rose in him a mighty pride in the name of Derwent Conniston.    It was his name now. John Keith was dead. It was Derwent Conniston who  was living. And as he looked down into the cold, still face of the  heroic Englishman, the thing did not seem so strange to him after all.  It would not be difficult to bear Conniston's name; the difficulty  would be in living up to the Conniston code.    That night the rumble of the ice fields was clearer because there was  no wind to deaden their tumult. The sky was cloudless, and the stars  were like glaring, yellow eyes peering through holes in a vast,  overhanging curtain of jet black. Keith, out to fill his lungs with  air, looked up at the phenomenon of the polar night and shuddered. The  stars were like living things, and they were looking at him. Under  their sinister glow the foxes were holding high carnival. It seemed to  Keith that they had drawn a closer circle about the cabin and that  there was a different note in their yapping now, a note that was more  persistent, more horrible. Conniston had foreseen that closing-in of  the little white beasts of the night, and Keith, reentering the cabin,  set about the fulfillment of his promise. Ghostly dawn found his task  completed.    Half an hour later he stood in the edge of the scrub timber that rimmed  in the arctic plain, and looked for the last time upon the little cabin  under the floor of which the Englishman was buried. It stood there  splendidly unafraid in its terrible loneliness, a proud monument to a  dead man's courage and a dead man's soul. Within its four walls it  treasured a thing which gave to it at last a reason for being, a reason  for fighting against dissolution as long as one log could hold upon  another. Conniston's spirit had become a living part of it, and the  foxes might yap everlastingly, and the winds howl, and winter follow  winter, and long night follow long night--and it would stand there in  its pride fighting to the last, a memorial to Derwent Conniston, the  Englishman.    Looking back at it, Keith bared his head in the raw dawn. \"God bless  you, Conniston,\" he whispered, and turned slowly away and into the  south.    Ahead of him was eight hundred miles of wilderness--eight hundred miles  between him and the little town on the Saskatchewan where McDowell  commanded Division of the Royal Mounted. The thought of distance did  not appall him. Four years at the top of the earth had accustomed him  to the illimitable and had inured him to the lack of things. That  winter Conniston had followed him with the tenacity of a ferret for a  thousand miles along the rim of the Arctic, and it had been a miracle  that he had not killed the Englishman. A score of times he might have  ended the exciting chase without staining his own hands. His Eskimo  friends would have performed the deed at a word. But he had let the  Englishman live, and Conniston, dead, was sending him back home. Eight  hundred miles was but the step between.    He had no dogs or sledge. His own team had given up the ghost long ago,  and a treacherous Kogmollock from the Roes Welcome had stolen the  Englishman's outfit in the last lap of their race down from Fullerton's  Point. What he carried was Conniston's, with the exception of his rifle  and his own parka and hood. He even wore Conniston's watch. His pack  was light. The chief articles it contained were a little flour, a  three-pound tent, a sleeping-bag, and certain articles of  identification to prove the death of John Keith, the outlaw. Hour after  hour of that first day the zip, zip, zip of his snowshoes beat with  deadly monotony upon his brain. He could not think. Time and again it  seemed to him that something was pulling him back, and always he was  hearing Conniston's voice and seeing Conniston's face in the gray gloom  of the day about him. He passed through the slim finger of scrub timber  that a strange freak of nature had flung across the plain, and once  more was a moving speck in a wide and wind-swept barren. In the  afternoon he made out a dark rim on the southern horizon and knew it  was timber, real timber, the first he had seen since that day, a year  and a half ago, when the last of the Mackenzie River forest had faded  away behind him! It gave him, at last, something tangible to grip. It  was a thing beckoning to him, a sentient, living wall beyond which was  his other world. The eight hundred miles meant less to him than the  space between himself and that growing, black rim on the horizon.    He reached it as the twilight of the day was dissolving into the deeper  dusk of the night, and put up his tent in the shelter of a clump of  gnarled and storm-beaten spruce. Then he gathered wood and built  himself a fire. He did not count the sticks as he had counted them for  eighteen months. He was wasteful, prodigal. He had traveled forty miles  since morning but he felt no exhaustion. He gathered wood until he had  a great pile of it, and the flames of his fire leaped higher and higher  until the spruce needles crackled and hissed over his head. He boiled a  pot of weak tea and made a supper of caribou meat and a bit of bannock.  Then he sat with his back to a tree and stared into the flames.    The fire leaping and crackling before his eyes was like a powerful  medicine. It stirred things that had lain dormant within him. It  consumed the heavy dross of four years of stupefying torture and  brought back to him vividly the"]]]
