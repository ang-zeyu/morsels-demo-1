These are used in speaking of the  letters, in pronouncing them in abbreviations, as \"ko to po\" for  \"k. t. p.\" (= etc.), and in spelling words, as \"bo, i, ro, do, o,  birdo\".                                    DIPHTHONGS.    5. Diphthongs are combinations of two vowels uttered as a single  sound, by one breath-impulse. The diphthongs in Esperanto contain an  i or u sound as the second element, but in order to avoid confusion  with combinations of vowels not forming diphthongs (as in \"naiva\", like  English \"naive\", etc.), they are written with \"j\" and \"ux\" instead.  Their pronunciation is as follows:    \"aj\" like \"ai\" in \"aisle\".    \"ej\" like \"ei\" in \"vein\", \"ey\" in \"they\".    \"oj\" like \"oi\" in \"coin\", \"oy\" in \"boy\".    \"uj\" like \"ui\" in \"ruin\", \"u(e)y\" in \"gluey\".    \"eux\" like \"ayw\" in \"wayward\", or like E(h)oo\" pronounced together.    \"aux\" like \"ou\" in \"out\", \"ow\" in \"owl\".                            COMBINATIONS OF CONSONANTS.    6. Each consonant, in a combination of two or more consonants, is  pronounced with its full value, whether within a word or at its  beginning. There are no silent letters.    a. Thus, both consonants are clearly sounded in the groups \"kn\", \"kv\",  \"gv\", \"sv\", in such words as \"knabo\", \"kvin\", \"gvidi\", \"sviso\".    b. The combination \"kz\", as in \"ekzisti\", \"ekzameno\", must not be  modified to the \"gs\" or \"ks\" represented by \"x\" in \"exist\", \"execute\".    c. The combination \"sc\", as in \"escepte\", \"scias\", is equivalent to the  combination \"sts\" in \"laST Said\", \"firST Song\", pronounced together  rapidly. The \"s\" in a word beginning with \"sc\" may be sounded with the  end of the preceding word, if that word ends in a vowel, as \"mis-cias\"  for \"mi scias\".    d. The \"n\" and \"g\" are pronounced separately in the combination \"ng\", in  such words as \"lingvo\", \"angulo\", producing the sound of \"ng\" heard in  \"linger\", not that in \"singer\".    e. Each of two similar letters is clearly sounded, as \"interrilato\",  \"ellasi\", like \"inter-relate\", \"well-laid\".                                     SYLLABLES.    7. Each word contains as many syllables as it has vowels and diphthongs.  The division of syllables within a word is as follows:    a. A single consonant goes with the following vowel, as \"pa-no\",  \"be-la\", \"a-e-ro\".    b. A consonant followed by \"l\" or \"r\" (which are liquids) goes with the  \"l\" or \"r\", as in \"ta-blo\", \"a-kra\", \"a-gra-bla\".    c. Otherwise, the syllable division is made before the last consonant of  the group, as \"sus-pek-ti\", \"sank-ta\", \"deks-tra\".    d. Prefixes are separated from the words to which they are attached,  as \"dis-meti\", \"mal-akra\", and compound words are divided into their  component parts, as \"cxef-urbo\", \"sun-ombrelo\".                                      ACCENT.    8. Words of more than one syllable are accented upon the syllable before  the last, as \"TA-blo\", \"a-GRA-bla\", \"sus-PEK-ti\".                                WORDS FOR PRACTICE.    9.

LESSON II.                                       NOUNS.    10. Words which are the names of persons or things are called nouns.  The ending, or final letter, of nouns in Esperanto is \"o\":       knabo = boy.                       pomo = apple.     cxevalo = horse.                   tablo = table.                                    THE ARTICLE.    11. The definite article is \"la\", the, as \"la knabo\", the boy, \"la  cxevalo\", the horse, \"la tablo\", the table, \"la pomo\", the apple. In  English there is an indefinite article \"a, an\" for the singular, but  none for the plural. Esperanto has no indefinite article for either  singular or plural. Therefore \"knabo\" may mean \"boy\", or \"a boy\", \"pomo\"  may mean \"apple\" or \"an apple\".                                     ADJECTIVES    12. A word used with a noun (expressed or understood) to express  a quality or characteristic is called an adjective. The ending of  adjectives in Esperanto is \"a\":       bela = beautiful.                  granda = large.     flava = yellow.                    forta = strong.                              ATTRIBUTIVE ADJECTIVES.    13. An adjective is said to modify a noun whose quality it expresses.  When directly preceding or following its noun, it is called an  attributive adjective:       la granda cxevalo = the large horse.     bela birdo = a beautiful bird.     floro flava = a yellow flower.     forta knabo = a strong boy.                             PRESENT TENSE OF THE VERB.    14. Words which express action or condition are called verbs. When  representing an act or condition as a fact, and dealing with the present  time, they are said to be in the present tense. The ending of all  Esperanto verbs in the present tense is \"-as\":       kuras = runs, is running.          brilas = shines, is shining.     flugas = flies, is flying.         dormas = sleeps, is sleeping.    15. The person or thing whose action or condition the verb expresses is  called the subject of the verb:       La suno brilas, the sun shines (is shining), subject: suno.     Knabo kuras, a boy runs (is running), subject: knabo.                                    VOCABULARY.            (To be memorized in this and in all following lessons.)       bela = beautiful.                  kaj = and.     birdo = bird.                      kantas = sings, is singing.     blanka = white.                    knabo = boy.     bona = good.                       kuras = runs, is running.     brilas = shines, is shining.       la = the.     cxevalo = horse.                   luno = moon.     dormas = sleeps, is sleeping.      marsxas = walks, is walking.     flava = yellow.                    pomo = apple.     floro = flower.                    suno = sun.     flugas = flies, is flying.         tablo = table.     forta = strong,                    violo = violet.     granda = large.                    viro = man.

THE PLURAL NUMBER.    16. The plural number of nouns, that is, the form which indicates  more than one person or thing, is made by adding \"-j\" to the noun, as  \"viroj\", men, from \"viro\", man; \"tabloj\", tables, from \"tablo\", table.    [Footnote: \"-oj\" is pronounced like \"oy\" in \"boy\". See 5.]    17. An adjective modifying a plural noun agrees with it in number, being  given the plural form by the addition of the ending -j. An adjective  modifying two or more nouns used together is of course given the plural  form:       bonaj viroj, good men.     grandaj cxevaloj, large horses.     belaj birdo kaj floro (bela birdo kaj bela floro),        beautiful bird and (beautiful) flower.    [Footnote: \"-aj\" is pronounced like \"ai\" in \"aisle\". See 5.]    18. The article is invariable, that is, does not change in form when  used with plural nouns, as \"la viro\", the man, \"la viroj\", the men. The  verb is also invariable in form:       La viroj marsxas, the men walk, the men are walking.     La suno kaj la luno brilas, the sun and the moon are shining.     La viro estas, the man is.     La viroj estas, the men are.                           PREDICATE ADJECTIVE AND NOUN.    19. When the adjective is a part of that which is told or predicated of  the subject of the verb, as when used with the verbs \"to be,\" \"to seem,\"  etc., it is called a \"predicate adjective\":       La birdo estas bela, the bird is beautiful.     La knabo sxajnas bona, the boy seems good.     La viroj estas fortaj, the men are strong.    20. A noun may also be used as part of the predicate, and is then called  a \"predicate noun\":       Violoj estas floroj, violets are flowers.     La kolombo estas birdo, the dove is a bird.    21. Predicate nouns and adjectives agree in number with the word  or words with which they are in predicate relation:       Rozoj estas belaj, roses are beautiful.     La knabo kaj la viro sxajnas fortaj, the boy and the man seem strong.                                     VOCABULARY       alta = high, tall.                 kolombo = dove.     arbo = tree.                       kusxas = lies, is lying, lie.     cxambro = room.                    longa = long.     domo = house.                      rozo = rose.     en = in.                           rugxa = red.     estas = is, are.                   segxo = chair.     folio = leaf.                      sidas = sits, sit, is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/779"],[0,"The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus (#3)"],[1,"ow! my soul to the devil for a shoulder of mutton, though       'twere blood-raw! not so, good friend:  by'r lady,[67] I had need       have it well roasted, and good sauce to it, if I pay so dear.         WAGNER. Well, wilt thou serve me, and I'll make thee go like       Qui mihi discipulus?[68]         CLOWN. How, in verse?         WAGNER. No, sirrah; in beaten silk and staves-acre.[69]         CLOWN. How, how, knaves-acre! ay, I thought that was all the land       his father left him.  Do you hear?  I would be sorry to rob you of       your living.         WAGNER. Sirrah, I say in staves-acre.         CLOWN. Oho, oho, staves-acre! why, then, belike, if I were your       man, I should be full of vermin.[70]         WAGNER. So thou shalt, whether thou beest with me or no.  But,       sirrah, leave your jesting, and bind yourself presently unto me       for seven years, or I'll turn all the lice about thee into       familiars,[71] and they shall tear thee in pieces.         CLOWN. Do you hear, sir? you may save that labour; they are too       familiar with me already:  swowns, they are as bold with my flesh       as if they had paid for their[72] meat and drink.         WAGNER. Well, do you hear, sirrah? hold, take these guilders.            [Gives money.]         CLOWN. Gridirons! what be they?         WAGNER. Why, French crowns.         CLOWN. Mass, but for the name of French crowns, a man were as good       have as many English counters.  And what should I do with these?         WAGNER. Why, now, sirrah, thou art at an hour's warning, whensoever       or wheresoever the devil shall fetch thee.         CLOWN. No, no; here, take your gridirons again.         WAGNER. Truly, I'll none of them.         CLOWN. Truly, but you shall.         WAGNER. Bear witness I gave them him.         CLOWN. Bear witness I give them you again.         WAGNER. Well, I will cause two devils presently to fetch thee       away.--Baliol and Belcher!         CLOWN. Let your Baliol and your Belcher come here, and I'll       knock them, they were never so knocked since they were devils:       say I should kill one of them, what would folks say?  \"Do ye see       yonder tall fellow in the round slop?[73] he has killed the devil.\"       So I should be called Kill-devil all the parish over.              Enter two DEVILS; and the CLOWN runs up and down crying.         WAGNER. Baliol and Belcher,--spirits, away!            [Exeunt DEVILS.]         CLOWN. What, are they gone? a vengeance on them! they have vile[74]       long nails.  There was a he-devil and a she-devil:  I'll tell you       how you shall know them; all he-devils has horns, and all       she-devils has clifts and cloven feet.         WAGNER. Well, sirrah, follow me.         CLOWN. But, do you hear? if I should serve you, would you teach       me to raise up Banios and Belcheos?         WAGNER. I will teach thee to turn thyself to any thing, to a dog,       or a cat, or a mouse, or a rat, or any thing.         CLOWN. How! a Christian fellow to a dog, or a cat, a mouse,       or a rat! no, no, sir; if you turn me into any thing, let it be       in the likeness of a little pretty frisking flea, that I may be       here and there and every where:  O, I'll tickle the pretty wenches'       plackets!  I'll be amongst them, i'faith.         WAGNER. Well, sirrah, come.         CLOWN. But, do you hear, Wagner?         WAGNER. How!--Baliol and Belcher!         CLOWN. O Lord!  I pray, sir, let Banio and Belcher go sleep.         WAGNER. Villain, call me Master Wagner, and let thy left eye be       diametarily fixed upon my right heel, with quasi vestigiis       nostris[75] insistere.            [Exit.]         CLOWN. God forgive me, he speaks Dutch fustian.  Well, I'll follow       him; I'll serve him, that's flat.            [Exit.]              FAUSTUS discovered in his study.         FAUSTUS. Now, Faustus, must       Thou needs be damn'd, and canst thou not be sav'd:       What boots it, then, to think of God or heaven?       Away with such vain fancies, and despair;       Despair in God, and trust in Belzebub:       Now go not backward; no, Faustus, be resolute:       Why waver'st thou?  O, something soundeth in mine ears,       \"Abjure this magic, turn to God again!\"       Ay, and Faustus will turn to God again.       To God? he loves thee not;       The god thou serv'st is thine own appetite,       Wherein is fix'd the love of Belzebub:       To him I'll build an altar and a church,       And offer lukewarm blood of new-born babes.              Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.         GOOD ANGEL. Sweet Faustus, leave that execrable art.         FAUSTUS. Contrition, prayer, repentance--what of them?         GOOD ANGEL. O, they are means to bring thee unto heaven!         EVIL ANGEL. Rather illusions, fruits of lunacy,       That make men foolish that do trust them most.         GOOD ANGEL. Sweet Faustus, think of heaven and heavenly things.         EVIL ANGEL. No, Faustus; think of honour and of[76] wealth.            [Exeunt ANGELS.]         FAUSTUS. Of wealth!       Why, the signiory of Embden shall be mine.       When Mephistophilis shall stand by me,       What god can hurt thee, Faustus? thou art safe       Cast no more doubts.--Come, Mephistophilis,       And bring glad tidings from great Lucifer;--       Is't not midnight?--come, Mephistophilis,       Veni, veni, Mephistophile!              Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.         Now tell me[77] what says Lucifer, thy lord?         MEPHIST. That I shall wait on Faustus whilst he lives,[78]       So he will buy my service with his soul.         FAUSTUS. Already Faustus hath hazarded that for thee.         MEPHIST. But, Faustus, thou must bequeath it solemnly,       And write a deed of gift with thine own blood;       For that security craves great Lucifer.       If thou deny it, I will back to hell.         FAUSTUS. Stay, Mephistophilis, and tell me, what good will my soul       do thy lord?         MEPHIST. Enlarge his kingdom.         FAUSTUS. Is that the reason why[79] he tempts us thus?         MEPHIST. Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris.[80]         FAUSTUS. Why,[81] have you any pain that torture[82] others!         MEPHIST. As great as have the human souls of men.       But, tell me, Faustus, shall I have thy soul?       And I will be thy slave, and wait on thee,       And give thee more than thou hast wit to ask.         FAUSTUS. Ay, Mephistophilis, I give it thee.         MEPHIST. Then, Faustus,[83] stab thine arm courageously,       And bind thy soul, that at some certain day       Great Lucifer may claim it as his own;       And then be thou as great as Lucifer.         FAUSTUS. [Stabbing his arm] Lo, Mephistophilis, for love of thee,       I cut mine arm, and with my proper blood       Assure my soul to be great Lucifer's,       Chief lord and regent of perpetual night!       View here the blood that trickles from mine arm,       And let it be propitious for my wish.         MEPHIST. But, Faustus, thou must       Write it in manner of a deed of gift.         FAUSTUS. Ay, so I will [Writes].  But, Mephistophilis,       My blood congeals, and I can write no more.         MEPHIST. I'll fetch thee fire to dissolve it straight.            [Exit.]         FAUSTUS. What might the staying of my blood portend?       Is it unwilling I should write this bill?[84]       Why streams it not, that I may write afresh?       FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL:  ah, there it stay'd!       Why shouldst thou not? is not thy soul shine own?       Then write again, FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL.              Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with a chafer of coals.         MEPHIST. Here's fire; come, Faustus, set it on.[85]         FAUSTUS. So, now the blood begins to clear again;       Now will I make an end immediately.            [Writes.]         MEPHIST. O, what will not I do to obtain his soul?            [Aside.]         FAUSTUS. Consummatum est; this bill is ended,       And Faustus hath bequeath'd his soul to Lucifer.       But what is this inscription[86] on mine arm?       Homo, fuge:  whither should I fly?       If unto God, he'll throw me[87] down to hell.       My senses are deceiv'd; here's nothing writ:--       I see it plain; here in this place is writ,       Homo, fuge:  yet shall not Faustus fly.         MEPHIST. I'll fetch him somewhat to delight his mind.            [Aside, and then exit.]              Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with DEVILS, who give crowns            and rich apparel to FAUSTUS, dance, and then depart.         FAUSTUS. Speak, Mephistophilis, what means this show?         MEPHIST. Nothing, Faustus, but to delight thy mind withal,       And to shew thee what magic can perform.         FAUSTUS. But may I raise up spirits when I please?         MEPHIST. Ay, Faustus, and do greater things than these.         FAUSTUS. Then there's enough for a thousand souls.       Here, Mephistophilis, receive this scroll,       A deed of gift of body and of soul:       But yet conditionally that thou perform       All articles prescrib'd between us both.         MEPHIST. Faustus, I swear by hell and Lucifer       To effect all promises between us made!         FAUSTUS. Then hear me read them.  [Reads] ON THESE CONDITIONS       FOLLOWING.  FIRST, THAT FAUSTUS MAY BE A SPIRIT IN FORM AND       SUBSTANCE.  SECONDLY, THAT MEPHISTOPHILIS SHALL BE HIS SERVANT,       AND AT HIS COMMAND.  THIRDLY, THAT MEPHISTOPHILIS SHALL DO FOR HIM,       AND BRING HIM WHATSOEVER HE DESIRES.[88]  FOURTHLY, THAT HE SHALL       BE IN HIS CHAMBER OR HOUSE INVISIBLE.  LASTLY, THAT HE SHALL APPEAR       TO THE SAID JOHN FAUSTUS, AT ALL TIMES, IN WHAT FORM OR SHAPE       SOEVER HE PLEASE.  I, JOHN FAUSTUS, OF WERTENBERG, DOCTOR, BY       THESE PRESENTS, DO GIVE BOTH BODY AND SOUL TO LUCIFER PRINCE OF       THE EAST, AND HIS MINISTER MEPHISTOPHILIS; AND FURTHERMORE GRANT       UNTO THEM, THAT,[89] TWENTY-FOUR YEARS BEING EXPIRED, THE ARTICLES       ABOVE-WRITTEN"]]]
