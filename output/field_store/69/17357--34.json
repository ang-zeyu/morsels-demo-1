At last, he found a young lady who  seemed the very person, who visited the poor, and got up early in  the morning, and always wore white, and never forgot to wind up her  watch or do her duty; and Elsie almost thought that now the difficult  young gentleman must be satisfied, and say, \"This is the very thing.\"  When, lo! her attention wandered a little, and the next thing she  knew she was rolling off the lounge for the second time, in company  with Mrs. Hannah More.  They landed in the chairs, and Johnnie ran  and picked them both up.  Altogether, lying on the best parlor sofa  was not very restful; and as the day went on, and the sun beating on  the blindless windows made the room hotter, Elsie grew continually  more and more feverish and homesick and disconsolate.    Meanwhile Johnnie was kept in occupation by Mrs. Worrett, who had got  the idea firmly fixed in her mind, that the chief joy of a child's  life was to chase chickens.  Whenever a hen fluttered past the kitchen  door, which was about once in three minutes, she would cry: \"Here,  Johnnie, here's another chicken for you to chase;\" and poor Johnnie  would feel obliged to dash out into the sun.  Being a very polite  little girl, she did not like to say to Mrs. Worrett that running in  the heat was disagreeable: so by dinner-time she was thoroughly tired  out, and would have been cross if she had known how; but she didn't--  Johnnie was never cross.  After dinner it was even worse; for the sun  was hotter, and the chickens, who didn't mind sun, seemed to be  walking all the time.  \"Hurry, Johnnie, here's another,\" came so  constantly, that at last Elsie grew desperate, got up, and went to  the kitchen with a languid appeal: \"Please, Mrs. Worrett, won't you  let Johnnie stay by me, because my head aches so hard?\"  After that,  Johnnie had a rest; for Mrs. Worrett was the kindest of women, and  had no idea that she was not amusing her little guest in the most  delightful manner.    A little before six, Elsie's head felt better; and she and Johnnie  put on their hats, and went for a walk in the garden.  There was not  much to see: beds of vegetables,--a few currant bushes,--that was all.  Elsie was leaning against a paling, and trying to make out why the  Worrett house had that queer tiptoe expression, when a sudden loud  grunt startled her, and something touched the top of her head.  She  turned, and there was an enormous pig, standing on his hind legs, on  the other side of the paling.  He was taller than Elsie, as he stood  thus, and it was his cold nose which had touched her head.  Somehow,  appearing in this unexpected way, he seemed to the children like some  dreadful wild beast.  They screamed with fright, and fled to the house,  from which Elsie never ventured to stir again during their visit.  John chased chickens at intervals, but it was a doubtful pleasure;  and all the time she kept a wary eye on the distant pig.    That evening, while Mrs. Worrett slept and Mr. Worrett smoked outside  the door, Elsie felt so very miserable that she broke down altogether.  She put her head in Johnnie's lap, as they sat together in the darkest  corner of the room, and sobbed and cried, making as little noise as  she possibly could.  Johnnie comforted her with soft pats and  strokings; but did not dare to say a word, for fear Mrs. Worrett  should wake up and find them out.    When the morning came, Elsie's one thought was, would Alexander come  for them in the afternoon?  All day she watched the clock and the  road with feverish anxiety.  Oh! if papa had changed his mind,--had  decided to let them stay for a week at Conic Section,--what should  she do?  It was just possible to worry through and keep alive till  afternoon, she thought; but if they were forced to spend another  night in that feather-bed, with those mosquitoes, hearing the blue  shad rattle and quiver hour after hour,--she should die, she was  sure she should die!    But Elsie was not called upon to die, or even to discover how easy it  is to survive a little discomfort.  About five, her anxious watch was  rewarded by the appearance of a cloud of dust, out of which presently  emerged old Whitey's ears and the top of the well-known carryall.  They stopped at the gate.  There was Alexander, brisk and smiling,  very glad to see his \"little misses\" again, and to find them so glad  to go home.  Mrs. Worrett, however, did not discover that they were  glad; no indeed!  Elsie and John were much too polite for that.  They  thanked the old lady, and said good-by so prettily that, after they  were gone, she told Mr. Worrett that it hadn't been a bit of trouble  having them there, and she hoped they would come again; they enjoyed  every thing so much; only it was a pity that Elsie looked so peaked.  And at that very moment Elsie was sitting on the floor of the carryall,  with her head in John's lap, crying and sobbing for joy that the visit  was over and that she was on the way home.  \"If only I live to get  there,\" she said, \"I'll never, no, never, go into the country again!\"  which was silly enough; but we must forgive her because she was half  sick.    Ah, how charming home did look, with the family grouped in the shady  porch, Katy in her white wrapper, Clover with rose-buds in her belt,  and everybody ready to welcome and pet the little absentees!  There  was much hugging and kissing, and much to tell of what had happened  in the two days: how a letter had come from Cousin Helen; how Daisy  White had four kittens as white as herself; how Dorry had finished  his water-wheel,--a wheel which turned in the bath-tub, and was  \"really ingenious,\" papa said; and Phil had \"swapped\" one of his  bantam chicks for on of Eugene Slack's Bramapootras.  It was not  till they were all seated round the tea-table that anybody demanded  an account of the visit.  Elsie felt this a relief, and was just  thinking how delicious every thing was, from the sliced peaches to  the clinking ice in the milk-pitcher, when papa put the dreaded  question,--    \"Well, Elsie, so you decided to come, after all.  How was it?  Why  didn't you stay your week out?  You look pale, it seems to me.  Have  you been enjoying yourself too much?  Tell us all about it.\"    Elsie looked at papa, and papa looked at Elsie.  Dr. Carr's eyes  twinkled just a little, but otherwise he was perfectly grave.  Elsie  began to speak, then to laugh, then to cry, and the explanation, when  it came, was given in a mingled burst of all three.    \"O papa, it was horrid!  That is, Mrs. Worrett was just as kind as  could be, but so fat; and oh, such a pig!  I never imagined such a  pig!  And the calico on that horrid sofa was so slippery that I  rolled off five times, and once I hurt myself real badly.  And we  had a feather-bed; and I was so homesick that I cried all the  evening.\"    \"That must have been gratifying to Mrs. Worrett,\" put in Dr. Carr.    \"Oh! she didn't know it, papa.  She was asleep, and snoring so that  nobody could hear.  And the flies!--such flies, Katy!--and the  mosquitoes, and our window wouldn't open till I put in a nail.  I  am so glad to get home!  I never want to go into the country again,  never, never!  Oh, if Alexander hadn't come!--why, Clover, what are  you laughing for?  And Dorry,--I think it's very unkind,\" and Elsie  ran to Katy, hid her face, and began to cry.    \"Never mind, darling, they didn't mean to be unkind.  Papa, her hands  are quite hot; you must give her something.\"  Katy's voice shook a  little; but she would not hurt Elsie's feeling by showing that she  was amused.  Papa gave Elsie \"something\" before she went to bed,--  a very mild dose I fancy; for doctors' little girls, as a general  rule, do not take medicine, and next day she was much better.  As  the adventures of the Conic Section visit leaked out bit by bit, the  family laughed till it seemed as if they would never stop.  Phil was  forever enacting the pig, standing on his triumphant hind legs, and  patting Elsie's head with his nose; and many and many a time, \"It  will end like your visit to Mrs. Worrett,\" proved a useful check  when Elsie was in a self-willed mood and bent on some scheme which  for the moment struck her as delightful.  For one of the good things  about our childish mistakes is, that each one teaches us something;  and so, blundering on, we grow wiser, till, when the time comes, we  are ready to take our places among the wonderful grown-up people who  never make mistakes.          CHAPTER II.    A NEW YEAR AND A NEW PLAN.      When summer lingers on into October, it often seems as if winter,  anxious to catch a glimpse of her, hurries a little; and so people  are cheated out of their autumn.  It was so that year.  Almost as  soon as it ceased to be hot it began to be cold.  The leaves, instead  of drifting away in soft, dying colors, like sunset clouds, turned  yellow all at once; and were whirled off the trees in a single gusty  night, leaving every thing bare and desolate.  Thanksgiving came; and  before the smell of the turkey was fairly out of the house, it was  time to hang up stockings and dress the Christmas tree.  They had a  tree that year in honor of Katy's being downstairs.  Cecy, who had  gone away to boarding-school, came home; and it was all delightful,  except that the days flew too fast.  Clover said it seemed to her  very queer that there was so much less time than usual in the world.  She couldn't imagine what had become of it: there used to be plenty.  And she was certain that Dorry must have been tinkering all the  clocks,--they struck so often.    It was just after New Year that Dr. Carr walked in one day with a  letter in his hand, and remarked: \"Mr. and Mrs. Page are coming to  stay with us.\"    \"Mr. and Mrs. Page,\" repeated Katy; \"who are they, papa?  Did I ever  see them?\"    \"Once, when you were "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51461"],[0,"A Pail of Air (#3)"],[1,"where we go for  coal.    In one of the rooms, an old man sits stiff in a chair, with an arm and  a leg in splints. In another, a man and woman are huddled together in  a bed with heaps of covers over them. You can just see their heads  peeking out, close together. And in another a beautiful young lady is  sitting with a pile of wraps huddled around her, looking hopefully  toward the door, as if waiting for someone who never came back with  warmth and food. They're all still and stiff as statues, of course, but  just like life.    Pa showed them to me once in quick winks of his flashlight, when  he still had a fair supply of batteries and could afford to waste  a little light. They scared me pretty bad and made my heart pound,  especially the young lady.           *       *       *       *       *    Now, with Pa telling his story for the umpteenth time to take our minds  off another scare, I got to thinking of the frozen folk again. All of a  sudden I got an idea that scared me worse than anything yet. You see,  I'd just remembered the face I'd thought I'd seen in the window. I'd  forgotten about that on account of trying to hide it from the others.    What, I asked myself, if the frozen folk were coming to life? What  if they were like the liquid helium that got a new lease on life  and started crawling toward the heat just when you thought its  molecules ought to freeze solid forever? Or like the electricity that  moves endlessly when it's just about as cold as that? What if the  ever-growing cold, with the temperature creeping down the last few  degrees to the last zero, had mysteriously wakened the frozen folk to  life--not warm-blooded life, but something icy and horrible?    That was a worse idea than the one about something coming down from the  dark star to get us.    Or maybe, I thought, both ideas might be true. Something coming down  from the dark star and making the frozen folk move, using them to do  its work. That would fit with both things I'd seen--the beautiful young  lady and the moving, starlike light.    The frozen folk with minds from the dark star behind their unwinking  eyes, creeping, crawling, snuffing their way, following the heat to the  Nest.    I tell you, that thought gave me a very bad turn and I wanted very  badly to tell the others my fears, but I remembered what Pa had said  and clenched my teeth and didn't speak.    We were all sitting very still. Even the fire was burning silently.  There was just the sound of Pa's voice and the clocks.    And then, from beyond the blankets, I thought I heard a tiny noise. My  skin tightened all over me.    Pa was telling about the early years in the Nest and had come to the  place where he philosophizes.    \"So I asked myself then,\" he said, \"what's the use of going on? What's  the use of dragging it out for a few years? Why prolong a doomed  existence of hard work and cold and loneliness? The human race is done.  The Earth is done. Why not give up, I asked myself--and all of a sudden  I got the answer.\"    Again I heard the noise, louder this time, a kind of uncertain,  shuffling tread, coming closer. I couldn't breathe.    \"Life's always been a business of working hard and fighting the cold,\"  Pa was saying. \"The earth's always been a lonely place, millions of  miles from the next planet. And no matter how long the human race might  have lived, the end would have come some night. Those things don't  matter. What matters is that life is good. It has a lovely texture,  like some rich cloth or fur, or the petals of flowers--you've seen  pictures of those, but I can't describe how they feel--or the fire's  glow. It makes everything else worth while. And that's as true for the  last man as the first.\"    And still the steps kept shuffling closer. It seemed to me that the  inmost blanket trembled and bulged a little. Just as if they were  burned into my imagination, I kept seeing those peering, frozen eyes.    \"So right then and there,\" Pa went on, and now I could tell that he  heard the steps, too, and was talking loud so we maybe wouldn't hear  them, \"right then and there I told myself that I was going on as if  we had all eternity ahead of us. I'd have children and teach them all  I could. I'd get them to read books. I'd plan for the future, try to  enlarge and seal the Nest. I'd do what I could to keep everything  beautiful and growing. I'd keep alive my feeling of wonder even at the  cold and the dark and the distant stars.\"    But then the blanket actually did move and lift. And there was a bright  light somewhere behind it. Pa's voice stopped and his eyes turned to  the widening slit and his hand went out until it touched and gripped  the handle of the hammer beside him.           *       *       *       *       *    In through the blanket stepped the beautiful young lady. She stood  there looking at us the strangest way, and she carried something  bright and unwinking in her hand. And two other faces peered over her  shoulders--men's faces, white and staring.    Well, my heart couldn't have been stopped for more than four or five  beats before I realized she was wearing a suit and helmet like Pa's  homemade ones, only fancier, and that the men were, too--and that the  frozen folk certainly wouldn't be wearing those. Also, I noticed that  the bright thing in her hand was just a kind of flashlight.    The silence kept on while I swallowed hard a couple of times, and after  that there was all sorts of jabbering and commotion.    They were simply people, you see. We hadn't been the only ones to  survive; we'd just thought so, for natural enough reasons. These three  people had survived, and quite a few others with them. And when we  found out _how_ they'd survived, Pa let out the biggest whoop of joy.    They were from Los Alamos and they were getting their heat and power  from atomic energy. Just using the uranium and plutonium intended  for bombs, they had enough to go on for thousands of years. They had  a regular little airtight city, with air-locks and all. They even  generated electric light and grew plants and animals by it. (At this Pa  let out a second whoop, waking Ma from her faint.)    But if we were flabbergasted at them, they were double-flabbergasted at  us.    One of the men kept saying, \"But it's impossible, I tell you. You  can't maintain an air supply without hermetic sealing. It's simply  impossible.\"    That was after he had got his helmet off and was using our air.  Meanwhile, the young lady kept looking around at us as if we were  saints, and telling us we'd done something amazing, and suddenly she  broke down and cried.    They'd been scouting around for survivors, but they never expected to  find any in a place like this. They had rocket ships at Los Alamos and  plenty of chemical fuel. As for liquid oxygen, all you had to do was  go out and shovel the air blanket at the top _level_. So after they'd  got things going smoothly at Los Alamos, which had taken years, they'd  decided to make some trips to likely places where there might be other  survivors. No good trying long-distance radio signals, of course, since  there was no atmosphere to carry them around the curve of the Earth.    Well, they'd found other colonies at Argonne and Brookhaven and way  around the world at Harwell and Tanna Tuva. And now they'd been giving  our city a look, not really expecting to find anything. But they had an  instrument that noticed the faintest heat waves and it had told them  there was something warm down here, so they'd landed to investigate.  Of course we hadn't heard them land, since there was no air to carry  the sound, and they'd had to investigate around quite a while before  finding us. Their instruments had given them a wrong steer and they'd  wasted some time in the building across the street.           *       *       *       *       *    By now, all five adults were talking like sixty. Pa was demonstrating  to the men how he worked the fire and got rid of the ice in the chimney  and all that. Ma had perked up wonderfully and was showing the young  lady her cooking and sewing stuff, and even asking about how the women  dressed at Los Alamos. The strangers marveled at everything and praised  it to the skies. I could tell from the way they wrinkled their noses  that they found the Nest a bit smelly, but they never mentioned that at  all and just asked bushels of questions.    In fact, there was so much talking and excitement that Pa forgot about  things, and it wasn't until they were all getting groggy that he looked  and found the air had all boiled away in the pail. He got another  bucket of air quick from behind the blankets. Of course that started  them all laughing and jabbering again. The newcomers even got a little  drunk. They weren't used to so much oxygen.    Funny thing, though--I didn't do much talking at all and Sis hung on  to Ma all the time and hid her face when anybody looked at her. I felt  pretty uncomfortable and disturbed myself, even about the young lady.  Glimpsing her outside there, I'd had all sorts of mushy thoughts, but  now I was just embarrassed and scared of her, even though she tried to  be nice as anything to me.    I sort of wished they'd all quit crowding the Nest and let us be alone  and get our feelings straightened out.    And when the newcomers began to talk about our all going to Los Alamos,  as if that were taken for granted, I could see that something of the  same feeling struck Pa and Ma, too. Pa got very silent all of a sudden  and Ma kept telling the young lady, \"But I wouldn't know how to act  there and I haven't any clothes.\"    The strangers were puzzled like anything at first, but then they got  the idea. As Pa kept saying, \"It just doesn't seem right to let this  fire go out.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Well, the strangers are gone, but they're coming back. It hasn't been  decided yet just what will happen. Maybe the Nest will be kept up as  what"]]]
