[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/446"],[0,"A Book of Remarkable Criminals (#3)"],[1," not the work  of Henry VII.--in which case that monarch deserves to be hailed as  one of the most consummate criminals that ever breathed and the worthy  father of a criminal son--was no doubt forced to a certain extent on  Richard by the exigencies of his situation, one of those crimes to which  bad men are driven in order to secure the fruits of other crimes. But  the Richard of Shakespeare is no child of circumstance. He espouses  deliberately a career of crime, as deliberately as Peace or Holmes or  Butler; he sets out \"determined to prove a villain,\" to be \"subtle,  false and treacherous,\" to employ to gain his ends \"stern murder in the  dir'st degree.\" The character is sometimes criticised as being overdrawn  and unreal. It may not be true to the Richard of history, but it is very  true to crime, and to the historical criminal of the Borgian or Prussian  type, in which fraud and violence are made part of a deliberate system  of so-called statecraft.    Shakespeare got nearer to what we may term the domestic as opposed to  the political criminal when he created Iago. In their envy and dislike  of their fellowmen, their contempt for humanity in general, their  callousness to the ordinary sympathies of human nature, Robert Butler,  Lacenaire, Ruloff are witnesses to the poet's fidelity to criminal  character in his drawing of the Ancient. But there is a weakness in  the character of Iago regarded as a purely instinctive and malignant  criminal; indeed it is a weakness in the consistency of the play. On two  occasions Iago states explicitly that Othello is more than suspected of  having committed adultery with his wife, Emilia, and that therefore he  has a strong and justifiable motive for being revenged on the Moor.  The thought of it he describes as \"gnawing his inwards.\" Emilia's  conversation with Desdemona in the last act lends some colour to the  correctness of Iago's belief. If this belief be well-founded it  must greatly modify his character as a purely wanton and mischievous  criminal, a supreme villain, and lower correspondingly the character  of Othello as an honourable and high-minded man. If it be a morbid  suspicion, having no ground in fact, a mental obsession, then Iago  becomes abnormal and consequently more or less irresponsible. But this  suggestion of Emilia's faithlessness made in the early part of the play  is never followed up by the dramatist, and the spectator is left in  complete uncertainty as to whether there be any truth or not in  Iago's suspicion. If Othello has played his Ancient false, that is an  extenuating circumstance in the otherwise extraordinary guilt of Iago,  and would no doubt be accorded to him as such, were he on trial before a  French jury.    The most successful, and therefore perhaps the greatest, criminal in  Shakespeare is King Claudius of Denmark. His murder of his brother by  pouring a deadly poison into his ear while sleeping, is so skilfully  perpetrated as to leave no suspicion of foul play. But for a  supernatural intervention, a contingency against which no murderer could  be expected to have provided, the crime of Claudius would never have  been discovered. Smiling, jovial, genial as M. Derues or Dr. Palmer,  King Claudius might have gone down to his grave in peace as the bluff  hearty man of action, while his introspective nephew would in all  probability have ended his days in the cloister, regarded with amiable  contempt by his bustling fellowmen. How Claudius got over the great  difficulty of all poisoners, that of procuring the necessary poison  without detection, we are not told; by what means he distilled the  \"juice of cursed hebenon\"; how the strange appearance of the late  King's body, which \"an instant tetter\" had barked about with \"vile and  loathsome crust,\" was explained to the multitude we are left to imagine.  There is no real evidence to show that Queen Gertrude was her lover's  accomplice in her husband's murder. If that had been so, she would  no doubt have been of considerable assistance to Claudius in the  preparation of the crime. But in the absence of more definite proof  we must assume Claudius' murder of his brother to have been a solitary  achievement, skilfully carried out by one whose genial good-fellowship  and convivial habits gave the lie to any suggestion of criminality.  Whatever may have been his inward feelings of remorse or self-reproach,  Claudius masked them successfully from the eyes of all. Hamlet's  instinctive dislike of his uncle was not shared by the members of the  Danish court. The \"witchcraft of his wit,\" his \"traitorous gifts,\"  were powerful aids to Claudius, not only in the seduction of his  sister-in-law, but the perpetration of secret murder.    The case of the murder of King Duncan of Scotland by Macbeth and his  wife belongs to a different class of crime. It is a striking example of  dual crime, four instances of which are given towards the end of this  book. An Italian advocate, Scipio Sighele, has devoted a monograph to  the subject of dual crime, in which he examines a number of cases in  which two persons have jointly committed heinous crimes.(3) He finds  that in couples of this kind there is usually an incubus and a succubus,  the one who suggests the crime, the other on whom the suggestion works  until he or she becomes the accomplice or instrument of the stronger  will; \"the one playing the Mephistophelian part of tempter, preaching  evil, urging to crime, the other allowing himself to be overcome by his  evil genius.\" In some cases these two roles are clearly differentiated;  it is easy, as in the case of Iago and Othello, Cassius and Brutus, to  say who prompted the crime. In others the guilt seems equally divided  and the original suggestion of crime to spring from a mutual tendency  towards the adoption of such an expedient. In Macbeth and his wife we  have a perfect instance of the latter class. No sooner have the witches  prophesied that Macbeth shall be a king than the \"horrid image\" of  the suggestion to murder Duncan presents itself to his mind, and, on  returning to his wife, he answers her question as to when Duncan is  to leave their house by the significant remark, \"To-morrow--as he  proposes.\" To Lady Macbeth from the moment she has received her  husband's letter telling of the prophecy of the weird sisters, murder  occurs as a means of accomplishing their prediction. In the minds  of Macbeth and his wife the suggestion of murder is originally an  auto-suggestion, coming to them independently of each other as soon as  they learn from the witches that Macbeth is one day to be a king. To  Banquo a somewhat similar intimation is given, but no foul thought of  crime suggests itself for an instant to his loyal nature. What Macbeth  and his wife lack at first as thorough-going murderers is that complete  insensibility to taking human life that marks the really ruthless  assassin. Lady Macbeth has the stronger will of the two for the  commission of the deed. It is doubtful whether without her help Macbeth  would ever have undertaken it. But even she, when her husband hesitates  to strike, cannot bring herself to murder the aged Duncan with her own  hands because of his resemblance as he sleeps to her father. It is only  after a deal of boggling and at serious risk of untimely interruption  that the two contrive to do the murder, and plaster with blood the  \"surfeited grooms.\" In thus putting suspicion on the servants of Duncan  the assassins cunningly avert suspicion from themselves, and Macbeth's  killing of the unfortunate men in seeming indignation at the discovery  of their crime is a master-stroke of ingenuity. \"Who,\" he asks in a  splendid burst of feigned horror, \"can be wise, amazed, temperate and  furious, loyal and natural in a moment?\" At the same time Lady Macbeth  affects to swoon away in the presence of so awful a crime. For the time  all suspicion of guilt, except in the mind of Banquo, is averted from  the real murderers. But, like so many criminals, Macbeth finds it  impossible to rest on his first success in crime. His sensibility grows  dulled; he \"forgets the taste of fear\"; the murder of Banquo and his  son is diabolically planned, and that is soon followed by the outrageous  slaughter of the wife and children of Macduff. Ferri, the Italian writer  on crime, describes the psychical condition favourable to the commission  of murder as an absence of both moral repugnance to the crime itself and  the fear of the consequences following it. In the murder of Duncan, it  is the first of these two states of mind to which Macbeth and his wife  have only partially attained. The moral repugnance stronger in the  man has not been wholly lost by the woman. But as soon as the crime is  successfully accomplished, this repugnance begins to wear off until the  King and Queen are able calmly and deliberately to contemplate those  further crimes necessary to their peace of mind. But now Macbeth, at  first the more compunctious of the two, has become the more ruthless;  the germ of crime, developed by suggestion, has spread through his whole  being; he has begun to acquire that indifference to human suffering with  which Richard III. and Iago were gifted from the first. In both  Macbeth and Lady Macbeth the germ of crime was latent; they wanted only  favourable circumstances to convert them into one of those criminal  couples who are the more dangerous for the fact that the temptation  to crime has come to each spontaneously and grown and been fostered by  mutual understanding, an elective affinity for evil. Such couples are  frequent in the history of crime. Eyraud and Bompard, Mr. and Mrs.  Manning, Burke and Hare, the Peltzer brothers, Barre and Lebiez, are  instances of those collaborations in crime which find their counterpart  in history, literature, drama and business. Antoninus and Aurelius,  Ferdinand and Isabella, the De Goncourt brothers, Besant and Rice,  Gilbert and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/448"],[0,"The Psychology of Revolution (#3)"],[1,"  We shall not consider the Revolution as a clean sweep in  history, as its apostles believed it.  We know that to  demonstrate their intention of creating a world distinct from the  old they initiated a new era and professed to break entirely with  all vestiges of the past.    But the past never dies.  It is even more truly within us than  without us.  Against their will the reformers of the Revolution  remained saturated with the past, and could only continue, under  other names, the traditions of the monarchy, even exaggerating  the autocracy and centralisation of the old system.  Tocqueville  had no difficulty in proving that the Revolution did little but  overturn that which was about to fall.    If in reality the Revolution destroyed but little it favoured the  fruition of certain ideas which continued thenceforth to develop.    The fraternity and liberty which it proclaimed never greatly  seduced the peoples, but equality became their gospel: the pivot  of socialism and of the entire evolution of modern democratic  ideas.  We may therefore say that the Revolution did not end with  the advent of the Empire, nor with the successive restorations  which followed it.  Secretly or in the light of day it has slowly  unrolled itself and still affects men's minds.      The study of the French Revolution to which a great part of this  book is devoted will perhaps deprive the reader of more than one  illusion, by proving to him that the books which recount the  history of the Revolution contain in reality a mass of legends  very remote from reality.    These legends will doubtless retain more life than history  itself.  Do not regret this too greatly.  It may interest a few  philosophers to know the truth, but the peoples will always  prefer dreams.  Synthetising their ideal, such dreams will always  constitute powerful motives of action.  One would lose courage  were it not sustained by false ideas, said Fontenelle.  Joan of  Arc, the Giants of the Convention, the Imperial epic--all these  dazzling images of the past will always remain sources of hope in  the gloomy hours that follow defeat.  They form part of that  patrimony of illusions left us by our fathers, whose power is  often greater than that of reality.  The dream, the ideal, the  legend--in a word, the unreal--it is that which shapes history.      PART I    THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ELEMENTS OF REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS        BOOK I    GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF REVOLUTIONS    CHAPTER I    SCIENTIFIC AND POLITICAL REVOLUTIONS    1.  Classification of Revolutions.    We generally apply the term revolution to sudden political  changes, but the expression may be employed to denote all sudden  transformations, or transformations apparently sudden, whether of  beliefs, ideas, or doctrines.    We have considered elsewhere the part played by the rational,  affective, and mystic factors in the genesis of the opinions and  beliefs which determine conduct.  We need not therefore return to  the subject here.    A revolution may finally become a belief, but it often commences  under the action of perfectly rational motives: the suppression  of crying abuses, of a detested despotic government, or an  unpopular sovereign, &c.    Although the origin of a revolution may be perfectly rational, we  must not forget that the reasons invoked in preparing for it do  not influence the crowd until they have been transformed  into sentiments.  Rational logic can point to the abuses to be  destroyed, but to move the multitude its hopes must be awakened.  This can only be effected by the action of the affective and  mystic elements which give man the power to act.  At the time of  the French Revolution, for example, rational logic, in the hands  of the philosophers, demonstrated the inconveniences of the  ancien regime, and excited the desire to change it.  Mystic  logic inspired belief in the virtues of a society created in all  its members according to certain principles.  Affective logic  unchained the passions confined by the bonds of ages and led to  the worst excesses.  Collective logic ruled the clubs and the  Assemblies and impelled their members to actions which neither  rational nor affective nor mystic logic would ever have caused  them to commit.    Whatever its origin, a revolution is not productive of results  until it has sunk into the soul of the multitude.  Then events  acquire special forms resulting from the peculiar psychology of  crowds.  Popular movements for this reason have characteristics  so pronounced that the description of one will enable us to  comprehend the others.    The multitude is, therefore, the agent of a revolution; but not  its point of departure.  The crowd represents an amorphous being  which can do nothing, and will nothing, without a head to lead  it.  It will quickly exceed the impulse once received, but it  never creates it.    The sudden political revolutions which strike the historian most  forcibly are often the least important.  The great revolutions  are those of manners and thought.  Changing the name of a  government does not transform the mentality of a people.  To  overthrow the institutions of a people is not to re-shape its  soul.    The true revolutions, those which transform the destinies of the  peoples, are most frequently accomplished so slowly that the  historians can hardly point to their beginnings.  The term  evolution is, therefore, far more appropriate than revolution.    The various elements we have enumerated as entering into the  genesis of the majority of revolutions will not suffice to  classify them.  Considering only the designed object, we will  divide them into scientific revolutions, political revolutions,  and religious revolutions.    2.  Scientific Revolutions.      Scientific revolutions are by far the most important.  Although  they attract but little attention, they are often fraught with  remote consequences, such as are not engendered by political  revolutions.  We will therefore put them first, although we  cannot study them here.    For instance, if our conceptions of the universe have profoundly  changed since the time of the Revolution, it is because  astronomical discoveries and the application of experimental  methods have revolutionised them, by demonstrating that  phenomena, instead of being conditioned by the caprices of the  gods, are ruled by invariable laws.    Such revolutions are fittingly spoken of as evolution, on account  of their slowness.  But there are others which, although of the  same order, deserve the name of revolution by reason of their  rapidity: we may instance the theories of Darwin,  overthrowing the whole science of biology in a few years; the  discoveries of Pasteur, which revolutionised medicine during the  lifetime of their author; and the theory of the dissociation of  matter, proving that the atom, formerly supposed to be eternal,  is not immune from the laws which condemn all the elements of the  universe to decline and perish.    These scientific revolutions in the domain of ideas are purely  intellectual.  Our sentiments and beliefs do not affect them.  Men submit to them without discussing them.  Their results being  controllable by experience, they escape all criticism.      3.  Political Revolutions.      Beneath and very remote from these scientific revolutions, which  generate the progress of civilisations, are the religious and  political revolutions, which have no kinship with them.  While  scientific revolutions derive solely from rational elements,  political and religious beliefs are sustained almost exclusively  by affective and mystic factors.  Reason plays only a feeble part  in their genesis.    I insisted at some length in my book Opinions and Beliefs on  the affective and mystic origin of beliefs, showing that a  political or religious belief constitutes an act of faith  elaborated in unconsciousness, over which, in spite of all  appearances, reason has no hold.  I also showed that belief often  reaches such a degree of intensity that nothing can be opposed to  it.  The man hypnotised by his faith becomes an Apostle, ready to  sacrifice his interests, his happiness, and even his life for the  triumph of his faith.  The absurdity of his belief matters  little; for him it is a burning reality.  Certitudes of mystic  origin possess the marvellous power of entire domination over  thought, and can only be affected by time.    By the very fact that it is regarded as an absolute truth a  belief necessarily becomes intolerant.  This explains the  violence, hatred, and persecution which were the habitual  accompaniments of the great political and religious revolutions,  notably of the Reformation and the French Revolution.    Certain periods of French history remain incomprehensible if we  forget the affective and mystic origin of beliefs, their  necessary intolerance, the impossibility of reconciling them when  they come into mutual contact, and, finally, the power conferred  by mystic beliefs upon the sentiments which place themselves at  their service.    The foregoing conceptions are too novel as yet to have modified  the mentality of the historians.  They will continue to attempt  to explain, by means of rational logic, a host of phenomena which  are foreign to it.    Events such as the Reformation, which overwhelmed France for a  period of fifty years, were in no wise determined by rational  influences.  Yet rational influences are always invoked in  explanation, even in the most recent works.  Thus, in the  General History of Messrs. Lavisse and Rambaud, we read the  following explanation of the Reformation:--    ``It was a spontaneous movement, born here and there amidst the  people, from the reading of the Gospels and the free individual  reflections which were suggested to simple persons by an  extremely pious conscience and a very bold reasoning power.''    Contrary to the assertion of these historians, we may say with  certainty, in the first"]]]
