They talked while they worked, as any other group of campers might have  talked, and jested and laughed. Kells made a fire, and carried water,  then broke cedar boughs for later camp-fire use; one of the strangers  whom they called Bill hobbled the horses; the other unrolled the pack,  spread a tarpaulin, and emptied the greasy sacks; Roberts made biscuit  dough for the oven.    The sun sank red and a ruddy twilight fell. It soon passed. Darkness had  about set in when Roberts came over to Joan, carrying bread, coffee, and  venison.    \"Here's your supper, Joan,\" he called, quite loud and cheerily, and then  he whispered: \"Mebbe it ain't so bad. They-all seem friendly. But I'm  scared, Joan. If you jest wasn't so dam' handsome, or if only he hadn't  seen you!\"    \"Can't we slip off in the dark?\" she whispered in return.    \"We might try. But it'd be no use if they mean bad. I can't make up my  mind yet what's comin' off. It's all right for you to pretend you're  bashful. But don't lose your nerve.\"    Then he returned to the camp-fire. Joan was hungry. She ate and drank  what had been given her, and that helped her to realize reality. And  although dread abided with her, she grew curious. Almost she imagined  she was fascinated by her predicament. She had always been an emotional  girl of strong will and self-restraint. She had always longed for she  knew not what--perhaps freedom. Certain places had haunted her. She had  felt that something should have happened to her there. Yet nothing ever  had happened. Certain books had obsessed her, even when a child, and  often to her mother's dismay; for these books had been of wild places  and life on the sea, adventure, and bloodshed. It had always been said  of her that she should have been a boy.    Night settled down black. A pale, narrow cloud, marked by a train of  stars, extended across the dense blue sky. The wind moaned in the cedars  and roared in the replenished camp-fire. Sparks flew away into the  shadows. And on the puffs of smoke that blew toward her came the sweet,  pungent odor of burning cedar. Coyotes barked off under the brush, and  from away on the ridge drifted the dismal defiance of a wolf.    Camp-life was no new thing to Joan. She had crossed the plains in  a wagon-train, that more than once had known the long-drawn yell of  hostile Indians. She had prospected and hunted in the mountains with her  uncle, weeks at a time. But never before this night had the wildness,  the loneliness, been so vivid to her.    Roberts was on his knees, scouring his oven with wet sand. His big,  shaggy head nodded in the firelight. He seemed pondering and thick and  slow. There was a burden upon him. The man Bill and his companion lay  back against stones and conversed low. Kells stood up in the light of  the blaze. He had a pipe at which he took long pulls and then sent up  clouds of smoke. There was nothing imposing in his build or striking in  his face, at that distance; but it took no second look to see here was  a man remarkably out of the ordinary. Some kind of power and intensity  emanated from him. From time to time he appeared to glance in Joan's  direction; still, she could not be sure, for his eyes were but shadows.  He had cast aside his coat. He wore a vest open all the way, and a  checked soft shirt, with a black tie hanging untidily. A broad belt  swung below his hip and in the holster was a heavy gun. That was a  strange place to carry a gun, Joan thought. It looked awkward to her.  When he walked it might swing round and bump against his leg. And he  certainly would have to put it some other place when he rode.    \"Say, have you got a blanket for that girl?\" asked Kells, removing his  pipe from his lips to address Roberts.    \"I got saddle-blankets,\" responded Roberts. \"You see, we didn't expect  to be caught out.\"    \"I'll let you have one,\" said Kells, walking away from the fire. \"It  will be cold.\" He returned with a blanket, which he threw to Roberts.    \"Much obliged,\" muttered Roberts.    \"I'll bunk by the fire,\" went on the other, and with that he sat down  and appeared to become absorbed in thought.    Roberts brought the borrowed blanket and several saddle-blankets over to  where Joan was, and laying them down he began to kick and scrape stones  and brush aside.    \"Pretty rocky place, this here is,\" he said. \"Reckon you'll sleep some,  though.\"    Then he began arranging the blankets into a bed. Presently Joan felt a  tug at her riding-skirt. She looked down.    \"I'll be right by you,\" he whispered, with his big hand to his mouth,  \"an' I ain't a-goin' to sleep none.\"    Whereupon he returned to the camp-fire. Presently Joan, not because she  was tired or sleepy, but because she wanted to act naturally, lay down  on the bed and pulled a blanket up over her. There was no more talking  among the men. Once she heard the jingle of spurs and the rustle of  cedar brush. By and by Roberts came back to her, dragging his saddle,  and lay down near her. Joan raised up a little to see Kells motionless  and absorbed by the fire. He had a strained and tense position. She sank  back softly and looked up at the cold bright stars. What was going to  happen to her? Something terrible! The very night shadows, the silence,  the presence of strange men, all told her. And a shudder that was a  thrill ran over and over her.    She would lie awake. It would be impossible to sleep. And suddenly into  her full mind flashed an idea to slip away in the darkness, find her  horse, and so escape from any possible menace. This plan occupied her  thoughts for a long while. If she had not been used to Western ways she  would have tried just that thing. But she rejected it. She was not  sure that she could slip away, or find her horse, or elude pursuit,  and certainly not sure of her way home. It would be best to stay with  Roberts.    When that was settled her mind ceased to race. She grew languid and  sleepy. The warmth of the blankets stole over her. She had no idea of  sleeping, yet she found sleep more and more difficult to resist.  Time that must have been hours passed. The fire died down and then  brightened; the shadows darkened and then lightened. Someone now and  then got up to throw on wood. The thump of hobbled hoofs sounded out in  the darkness. The wind was still and the coyotes were gone. She could  no longer open her eyes. They seemed glued shut. And then gradually all  sense of the night and the wild, of the drowsy warmth, faded.    When she awoke the air was nipping cold. Her eyes snapped open clear and  bright. The tips of the cedars were ruddy in the sunrise. A camp-fire  crackled. Blue smoke curled upward. Joan sat up with a rush of memory.  Roberts and Kells were bustling round the fire. The man Bill was  carrying water. The other fellow had brought in the horses and was  taking off the hobbles. No one, apparently, paid any attention to Joan.  She got up and smoothed out her tangled hair, which she always wore in  a braid down her back when she rode. She had slept, then, and in her  boots! That was the first time she had ever done that. When she went  down to the brook to bathe her face and wash her hands, the men still,  apparently, took no notice of her. She began to hope that Roberts had  exaggerated their danger. Her horse was rather skittish and did not care  for strange hands. He broke away from the bunch. Joan went after him,  even lost sight of camp. Presently, after she caught him, she led him  back to camp and tied him up. And then she was so far emboldened as to  approach the fire and to greet the men.    \"Good morning,\" she said, brightly.    Kells had his back turned at the moment. He did not move or speak or  give any sign he had heard. The man Bill stared boldly at her, but  without a word. Roberts returned her greeting, and as she glanced  quickly at him, drawn by his voice, he turned away. But she had seen  that his face was dark, haggard, worn.    Joan's cheer and hope sustained a sudden and violent check. There was  something wrong in this group, and she could not guess what it was. She  seemed to have a queer, dragging weight at her limbs. She was glad  to move over to a stone and sink down upon it. Roberts brought her  breakfast, but he did not speak or look at her. His hands shook. And  this frightened Joan. What was going to happen? Roberts went back to  the camp-fire. Joan had to force herself to eat. There was one thing of  which she was sure--that she would need all the strength and fortitude  she could summon.    Joan became aware, presently, that Kells was conversing with Roberts,  but too low for her to hear what was said. She saw Roberts make a  gesture of fierce protest. About the other man there was an air cool,  persuading, dominant. He ceased speaking, as if the incident were  closed. Roberts hurried and blundered through his task with his pack and  went for his horse. The animal limped slightly, but evidently was not in  bad shape. Roberts saddled him, tied on the pack. Then he saddled Joan's  horse. That done, he squared around with the front of a man who had to  face something he dreaded.    \"Come on, Joan. We're ready,\" he called. His voice was loud, but not  natural.    Joan started to cross to him when Kells strode between them. She might  not have been there, for all the sign this ominous man gave of her  presence. He confronted Roberts in the middle of the camp-circle, and  halted, perhaps a rod distant.    \"Roberts, get on your horse and clear out,\" he said.    Roberts dropped his halter and straightened up. It was a bolder action  than any he had heretofore given. Perhaps the mask was off now; he was  wholly sure of what he had only feared; subterfuge and blindness were  in vain; and now he could be a man. Some change worked in his face--a  blanching, a setting.    \"No, I won't go without the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45532"],[0,"History of Julius Cæsar, Vol. 2 of 2 (#3)"],[1,".                                    642    COINS STRUCK IN SOUTHERN ITALY.                                      644    COINS STRUCK OUT OF ITALY.                                           644    GAULISH COINS (FROM CAMP D, ON THE BANKS OF THE OSE).                645      APPENDIX D.

THE WARS IN GAUL, AFTER THE \"COMMENTARIES.\"          CHAPTER I.    POLITICAL CAUSES OF THE GALLIC WAR.      [Sidenote: Enterprising Character of the Gauls.]    I. There are peoples whose existence in the past only reveals itself by  certain brilliant apparitions, unequivocal proofs of an energy which had  been previously unknown. During the interval their history is involved  in obscurity, and they resemble those long-silent volcanoes, which we  should take to be extinct but for the eruptions which, at periods far  apart, occur and expose to view the fire which smoulders in their bosom.  Such had been the Gauls.    The accounts of their ancient expeditions bear witness to an  organisation already powerful, and to an ardent spirit of enterprise.  Not to speak of migrations which date back perhaps nine or ten centuries  before our era, we see, at the moment when Rome was beginning to aim at  greatness, the Celts spreading themselves beyond their frontiers. In the  time of Tarquin the Elder (Years of Rome, 138 to 176), two expeditions  started from Celtic Gaul: one proceeded across the Rhine and Southern  Germany, to descend upon Illyria and Pannonia (now _Western Hungary_);  the other, scaling the Alps, established itself in Italy, in the country  lying between those mountains and the Po.[1] The invaders soon  transferred themselves to the right bank of that river, and nearly the  whole of the territory comprised between the Alps and the Apennines took  the name of _Cisalpine Gaul_. More than two centuries afterwards, the  descendants of those Gauls marched upon Rome, and burnt it all but the  Capitol.[2] Still a century later (475), we see new bands issuing from  Gaul, reaching Thrace by the valley of the Danube,[3] ravaging Northern  Greece, and bringing back to Toulouse the gold plundered from the Temple  of Delphi.[4] Others, arriving at Byzantium,[5] pass into Asia,  establish their dominion over the whole region on this side Mount  Taurus, since called _Gallo-Graecia_, or _Galatia_, and maintain in it a  sort of military feudalism until the time of the war of Antiochus.[6]    These facts, obscure as they may be in history, prove the spirit of  adventure and the warlike genius of the Gaulish race, which thus, in  fact, inspired a general terror. During nearly two centuries, from 364  to 531, Rome struggled against the Cisalpine Gauls, and more than once  the defeat of her armies placed her existence in danger. It was, as it  were, foot by foot that the Romans effected the conquest of Northern  Italy, strengthening it as they proceeded by the establishment of  colonies.    Let us here give a recapitulation of the principal wars against the  Gauls, Cisalpine and Transalpine, ich have already been spoken of in the  first volume of the present work. In 531 the Romans took the offensive,  crossed the Po, and subjugated a great part of the Cisalpine. But hardly  had the north of Italy been placed under the supremacy of the Republic,  when Hannibal's invasion (536) caused anew an insurrection of the  inhabitants of those countries, who helped to increase the numbers of  his army; and even when that great captain was obliged to quit Italy,  they continued to defend their independence during thirty-four years.  The struggle, renewed in 554, ended only in 588, for we will not take  into account the partial insurrections which followed. During this time,  Rome had not only to combat the Cisalpines, assisted by the Gauls from  beyond the Alps, but also to make war upon the men of their race in Asia  (565) and in Illyria. In this last-mentioned province the colony of  Aquileia was founded (571), and several wild tribes of Liguria, who held  the defiles of the Alps, were subjugated (588).    [Sidenote: Wars of the Romans beyond the Alps.]    II. In 600, the Romans, called to the assistance of the Greek town of  Marseilles, which was attacked by the Oxybii and the Deciates, Ligurian  tribes of the Maritime Alps,[7] for the first time carried their arms  to the other side of the Alps. They followed the course of the Corniche,  and crossed the Var; but it took, according to Strabo, a struggle of  eighty years before they obtained from the Ligures an extent of twelve  stadia (2.22 kils.), a narrow passage on the coast of the sea, to enable  them to pass through Gaul into Spain.[8] Nevertheless, the legions  pushed their encroachments between the Rhone and the Alps. The conquered  territory was given to the people of Marseilles, who soon, attacked  again by the peoples of the Maritime Alps, implored a second time the  support of Rome. In 629, the Consul M. Fulvius Flaccus was sent against  the Salluvii; and, three years afterwards,[9] the proconsul C. Sextius  Calvinus drove them back far from the sea-coast, and founded the town of  Aix (_Aquae Sextiae_).[10]    The Romans, by protecting the people of Marseilles, had extended their  dominion on the coast; by contracting other alliances, they penetrated  into the interior. The AEdui were at war with the Allobroges and the  Arverni. The proconsul Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus united with the former,  and defeated the Allobroges, in 633, at Vindalium, on the Sorgue  (_Sulgas_), not far from the Rhone. Subsequently, Q. Fabius Maximus,"]]]
