Indifferent,  however, to every sense of extravagance and to all other considerations  except those of personal pride, I rode away atop of the stage-coach,  full of exultation.  As we rattled past the Waite house I waved my cap  to Captivity and indulged in the pleasing hope that she would be  lonesome without me.  Much of the satisfaction of going away arises  from the thought that those you leave behind are likely to be  wretchedly miserable during your absence.    My Uncle Cephas lived in a house so very different from my  grandmother's that it took me some time to get used to the place. Uncle  Cephas was a lawyer, and his style of living was not at all like  grandmother's; he was to have been a minister, but at twelve years of  age he attended the county fair, and that incident seemed to change the  whole bent of his life.  At twenty-one he married Samantha Talbott, and  that was another  blow to grandmother, who always declared that the  Talbotts were a shiftless lot.  However, I was agreeably impressed with  Uncle Cephas and Aunt 'Manthy, for they welcomed me very cordially and  turned me over to my little cousins, Mary and Henry, and bade us three  make merry to the best of our ability.  These first favorable  impressions of my uncle's family were confirmed when I discovered that  for supper we had hot biscuit and dried beef warmed up in cream gravy,  a diet which, with all due respect to grandmother, I considered much  more desirable than dry bread and dried-apple sauce.    Aha, old Crusoe!  I see thee now in yonder case smiling out upon me as  cheerily as thou didst smile those many years ago when to a little boy  thou broughtest the message of Romance!  And I do love thee still, and  I shall always love thee, not only for thy benefaction in those ancient  days, but also for the light and the cheer which thy genius brings to  all ages and conditions of humanity.    My Uncle Cephas's library was stored with a large variety of pleasing  literature.  I did  not observe a glut of theological publications, and  I will admit that I felt somewhat aggrieved personally when, in answer  to my inquiry, I was told that there was no \"New England Primer\" in the  collection.  But this feeling was soon dissipated by the absorbing  interest I took in De Foe's masterpiece, a work unparalleled in the  realm of fiction.    I shall not say that \"Robinson Crusoe\" supplanted the Primer in my  affections; this would not be true.  I prefer to say what is the truth;  it was my second love.  Here again we behold another advantage which  the lover of books has over the lover of women. If he be a genuine  lover he can and should love any number of books, and this  polybibliophily is not to the disparagement of any one of that number.  But it is held by the expounders of our civil and our moral laws that  he who loveth one woman to the exclusion of all other women speaketh by  that action the best and highest praise both of his own sex and of hers.    I thank God continually that it hath been my lot in life to found an  empire in my heart--no cramped and wizened borough wherein one jealous  mistress hath exercised her petty tyranny, but an expansive and  ever-widening continent divided and subdivided into dominions,  jurisdictions, caliphates, chiefdoms, seneschalships, and prefectures,  wherein tetrarchs, burgraves, maharajahs, palatines, seigniors,  caziques, nabobs, emirs, nizams, and nawabs hold sway, each over his  special and particular realm, and all bound together in harmonious  cooperation by the conciliating spirit of polybibliophily!    Let me not be misunderstood; for I am not a woman-hater.  I do not  regret the acquaintances--nay, the friendships--I have formed with  individuals of the other sex.  As a philosopher it has behooved me to  study womankind, else I should not have appreciated the worth of these  other better loves.  Moreover, I take pleasure in my age in associating  this precious volume or that with one woman or another whose friendship  came into my life at the time when I was reading and loved that book.    The other day I found my nephew William swinging in the hammock on the  porch with his girl friend Celia; I saw that the  young people were  reading Ovid.  \"My children,\" said I, \"count this day a happy one.  In  the years of after life neither of you will speak or think of Ovid and  his tender verses without recalling at the same moment how of a  gracious afternoon in distant time you sat side by side contemplating  the ineffably precious promises of maturity and love.\"    I am not sure that I do not approve that article in Judge Methuen's  creed which insists that in this life of ours woman serves a  probationary period for sins of omission or of commission in a previous  existence, and that woman's next step upward toward the final eternity  of bliss is a period of longer or of shorter duration, in which her  soul enters into a book to be petted, fondled, beloved and cherished by  some good man--like the Judge, or like myself, for that matter.    This theory is not an unpleasant one; I regard it as much more  acceptable than those so-called scientific demonstrations which would  make us suppose that we are descended from tree-climbing and bug-eating  simians.  However, it is far from my purpose to enter upon any argument  of these questions at this time, for Judge Methuen himself is going to  write a book upon the subject, and the edition is to be limited to two  numbered and signed copies upon Japanese vellum, of which I am to have  one and the Judge the other.    The impression I made upon Uncle Cephas must have been favorable, for  when my next birthday rolled around there came with it a book from  Uncle Cephas--my third love, Grimm's \"Household Stories.\" With the  perusal of this monumental work was born that passion for fairy tales  and folklore which increased rather than diminished with my maturer  years.  Even at the present time I delight in a good fairy story, and I  am grateful to Lang and to Jacobs for the benefit they have conferred  upon me and the rest of English-reading humanity through the medium of  the fairy books and the folk tales they have translated and compiled.  Baring-Gould and Lady Wilde have done noble work in the same realm; the  writings of the former have interested me particularly, for together  with profound learning in directions which are specially pleasing to  me, Baring-Gould has a distinct literary touch which invests his work  with a grace indefinable but delicious and persuasive.    I am so great a lover of and believer in fairy tales that I once  organized a society for the dissemination of fairy literature, and at  the first meeting of this society we resolved to demand of the board of  education to drop mathematics from the curriculum in the public schools  and to substitute therefor a four years' course in fairy literature, to  be followed, if the pupil desired, by a post-graduate course in  demonology and folk-lore.  We hired and fitted up large rooms, and the  cause seemed to be flourishing until the second month's rent fell due.  It was then discovered that the treasury was empty; and with this  discovery the society ended its existence, without having accomplished  any tangible result other than the purchase of a number of sofas and  chairs, for which Judge Methuen and I had to pay.    Still, I am of the opinion (and Judge Methuen indorses it) that we need  in this country of ours just that influence which the fairy tale  exerts.  We are becoming too practical; the lust for material gain is  throttling every other consideration.  Our babes and sucklings are no  longer regaled with the soothing tales of giants, ogres, witches, and  fairies; their hungry, receptive minds are filled with stories about  the pursuit and slaughter of unoffending animals, of war and of murder,  and of those questionable practices whereby a hero is enriched and  others are impoverished.  Before he is out of his swaddling-cloth the  modern youngster is convinced that the one noble purpose in life is to  get, get, get, and keep on getting of worldly material. The fairy tale  is tabooed because, as the sordid parent alleges, it makes youth  unpractical.    One consequence of this deplorable condition is, as I have noticed (and  as Judge Methuen has, too), that the human eye is diminishing in size  and fulness, and is losing its lustre.  By as much as you take the  God-given grace of fancy from man, by so much do you impoverish his  eyes.  The eye is so beautiful and serves so very many noble purposes,  and is, too, so ready in the expression of tenderness, of pity, of  love, of solicitude, of compassion, of dignity, of every gentle mood  and noble inspiration, that in that metaphor which contemplates the  eternal vigilance of the Almighty we recognize the best poetic  expression of the highest human wisdom.    My nephew Timothy has three children, two boys and a girl.  The elder  boy and the girl have small black eyes; they are as devoid of fancy as  a napkin is of red corpuscles; they put their pennies into a tin bank,  and they have won all the marbles and jack-stones in the neighborhood.  They do not believe in Santa Claus or in fairies or in witches; they  know that two nickels make a dime, and their golden rule is to do  others as others would do them.  The other boy (he has been christened  Matthew, after me) has a pair of large, round, deep-blue eyes,  expressive of all those emotions which a keen, active fancy begets.    Matthew can never get his fill of fairy tales, and how the dear little  fellow loves Santa Claus!  He sees things at night; he will not go to  bed in the dark; he hears and understands what the birds and crickets  say, and what the night wind sings, and what the rustling leaves tell.  Wherever Matthew goes he sees beautiful pictures and hears sweet music;  to his impressionable soul all nature"]]]
