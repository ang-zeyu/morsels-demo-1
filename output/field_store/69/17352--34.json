It took only one question for Shefford to find that the trader was  starved for news of the outside world; and for an hour Shefford fed that  appetite, even as he had been done by. But when he had talked himself  out there seemed indication of Presbrey being more than a good listener.    \"How'd you come in?\" he asked, presently.    \"By Flagstaff--across the Little Colorado--and through Moencopie.\"    \"Did you stop at Moen Ave?\"    \"No. What place is that?\"    \"A missionary lives there. Did you stop at Tuba?\"    \"Only long enough to drink and water my horse. That was a wonderful  spring for the desert.\"    \"You said you were a wanderer.... Do you want a job? I'll give you one.\"    \"No, thank you, Presbrey.\"    \"I saw your pack. That's no pack to travel with in this country. Your  horse won't last, either. Have you any money?\"    \"Yes, plenty of money.\"    \"Well, that's good. Not that a white man out here would ever take a  dollar from you. But you can buy from the Indians as you go. Where are  you making for, anyhow?\"    Shefford hesitated, debating in mind whether to tell his purpose or not.  His host did not press the question.    \"I see. Just foot-loose and wandering around,\" went on Presbrey. \"I can  understand how the desert appeals to you. Preachers lead easy, safe,  crowded, bound lives. They're shut up in a church with a Bible and good  people. When once in a lifetime they get loose--they break out.\"    \"Yes, I've broken out--beyond all bounds,\" replied Shefford, sadly.  He seemed retrospective for a moment, unaware of the trader's keen and  sympathetic glance, and then he caught himself. \"I want to see some wild  life. Do you know the country north of here?\"    \"Only what the Navajos tell me. And they're not much to talk. There's  a trail goes north, but I've never traveled it. It's a new trail every  time an Indian goes that way, for here the sand blows and covers old  tracks. But few Navajos ride in from the north. My trade is mostly with  Indians up and down the valley.\"    \"How about water and grass?\"    \"We've had rain and snow. There's sure to be, water. Can't say about  grass, though the sheep and ponies from the north are always fat....  But, say, Shefford, if you'll excuse me for advising you--don't go  north.\"    \"Why?\" asked Shefford, and it was certain that he thrilled.    \"It's unknown country, terribly broken, as you can see from here, and  there are bad Indians biding in the canyon. I've never met a man who had  been over the pass between here and Kayenta. The trip's been made, so  there must be a trail. But it's a dangerous trip for any man, let alone  a tenderfoot. You're not even packing a gun.\"    \"What's this place Kayenta?\" asked Shefford.    \"It's a spring. Kayenta means Bottomless Spring. There's a little  trading-post, the last and the wildest in northern Arizona. Withers, the  trader who keeps it, hauls his supplies in from Colorado and New Mexico.  He's never come down this way. I never saw him. Know nothing of him  except hearsay. Reckon he's a nervy and strong man to hold that post. If  you want to go there, better go by way of Keams Canyon, and then around  the foot of Black Mesa. It'll be a long ride--maybe two hundred miles.\"    \"How far straight north over the pass?\"    \"Can't say. Upward of seventy-five miles over rough trails, if there are  trails at all.... I've heard rumors of a fine tribe of Navajos living in  there, rich in sheep and horses. It may be true and it may not. But I do  know there are bad Indians, half-breeds and outcasts, hiding in there.  Some of them have visited me here. Bad customers! More than that,  you'll be going close to the Utah line, and the Mormons over there are  unfriendly these days.\"    \"Why?\" queried Shefford, again with that curious thrill.    \"They are being persecuted by the government.\"    Shefford asked no more questions and his host vouchsafed no more  information on that score. The conversation lagged. Then Shefford  inquired about the Indian girl and learned that she lived up the valley  somewhere. Presbrey had never seen her before Willetts came with her  to Red Lake. And this query brought out the fact that Presbrey was  comparatively new to Red Lake and vicinity. Shefford wondered why a  lonely six months there had not made the trader old in experience.  Probably the desert did not readily give up its secrets. Moreover, this  Red Lake house was only an occasionally used branch of Presbrey's main  trading-post, which was situated at Willow Springs, fifty miles westward  over the mesa.    \"I'm closing up here soon for a spell,\" said Presbrey, and now his  face lost its set hardness and seemed singularly changed. It was a  difference, of light and softness. \"Won't be so lonesome over at Willow  Springs.... I'm being married soon.\"    \"That's fine,\" replied Shefford, warmly. He was glad for the sake of  this lonely desert man. What good a wife would bring into a trader's  life!    Presbrey's naive admission, however, appeared to detach him from his  present surroundings, and with his massive head enveloped by a cloud of  smoke he lived in dreams.    Shefford respected his host's serene abstraction. Indeed, he was  grateful for silence. Not for many nights had the past impinged so  closely upon the present. The wound in his soul had not healed, and to  speak of himself made it bleed anew. Memory was too poignant; the past  was too close; he wanted to forget until he had toiled into the heart of  this forbidding wilderness--until time had gone by and he dared to face  his unquiet soul. Then he listened to the steadily rising roar of the  wind. How strange and hollow! That wind was freighted with heavy sand,  and he heard it sweep, sweep, sweep by in gusts, and then blow with  dull, steady blast against the walls. The sound was provocative of  thought. This moan and rush of wind was no dream--this presence of his  in a night-enshrouded and sand-besieged house of the lonely desert was  reality--this adventure was not one of fancy. True indeed, then, must  be the wild, strange story that had led him hither. He was going on to  seek, to strive, to find. Somewhere northward in the broken fastnesses  lay hidden a valley walled in from the world. Would they be there, those  lost fugitives whose story had thrilled him? After twelve years would  she be alive, a child grown to womanhood in the solitude of a beautiful  canyon? Incredible! Yet he believed his friend's story and he indeed  knew how strange and tragic life was. He fancied he heard her voice  on the sweeping wind. She called to him, haunted him. He admitted the  improbability of her existence, but lost nothing of the persistent  intangible hope that drove him. He believed himself a man stricken in  soul, unworthy, through doubt of God, to minister to the people who had  banished him. Perhaps a labor of Hercules, a mighty and perilous work of  rescue, the saving of this lost and imprisoned girl, would help him in  his trouble. She might be his salvation. Who could tell? Always as a boy  and as a man he had fared forth to find the treasure at the foot of the  rainbow.          II. THE SAGI      Next morning the Indian girl was gone and the tracks of her pony led  north. Shefford's first thought was to wonder if he would overtake her  on the trail; and this surprised him with the proof of how unconsciously  his resolve to go on had formed.    Presbrey made no further attempt to turn Shefford back. But he insisted  on replenishing the pack, and that Shefford take weapons. Finally  Shefford was persuaded to accept a revolver. The trader bade him good-by  and stood in the door while Shefford led his horse down the slope  toward the water-hole. Perhaps the trader believed he was watching the  departure of a man who would never return. He was still standing at the  door of the post when Shefford halted at the pool.    Upon the level floor of the valley lay thin patches of snow which  had fallen during the night. The air was biting cold, yet stimulated  Shefford while it stung him. His horse drank rather slowly and  disgustedly. Then Shefford mounted and reluctantly turned his back upon  the trading-post.    As he rode away from the pool he saw a large flock of sheep approaching.  They were very closely, even densely, packed, in a solid slow-moving  mass and coming with a precision almost like a march. This fact  surprised Shefford, for there was not an Indian in sight. Presently he  saw that a dog was leading the flock, and a little later he discovered  another dog in the rear of the sheep. They were splendid, long-haired  dogs, of a wild-looking shepherd breed. He halted his horse to watch the  procession pass by. The flock covered fully an acre of ground and the  sheep were black, white, and brown. They passed him, making a little  pattering roar on the hard-caked sand. The dogs were taking the sheep in  to water.    Shefford went on and was drawing close to the other side of the basin,  where the flat red level was broken by rising dunes and ridges, when he  espied a bunch of ponies. A shrill whistle told him that they had seen  him. They were wild, shaggy, with long manes and tails. They stopped,  threw up their heads, and watched him. Shefford certainly returned the  attention. There was no Indian with them. Presently, with a snort, the  leader, which appeared to be a stallion, trotted behind the others,  seemed to be driving them, and went clear round the band to get in the  lead again. He was taking them in to water, the same as the dogs had  taken the sheep.    These incidents were new and pleasing to Shefford. How ignorant he had  been of life in the wilderness! Once more he received subtle intimations  of what he might learn out in the open; and it was with a less weighted  heart that he faced the gateway"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5089"],[0,"Boris Godunov: a drama in verse (#3)"],[1,"Boris.

O, what a weariness is our poor life,     What misery! Day comes, day goes, and ever     Is seen, is heard one thing alone; one sees     Only black cassocks, only hears the bell.     Yawning by day you wander, wander, nothing     To do; you doze; the whole night long till daylight     The poor monk lies awake; and when in sleep     You lose yourself, black dreams disturb the soul;     Glad that they sound the bell, that with a crutch     They rouse you.

Truly your life     Is but a sorry one, ye dissolute,     Wicked young monks!       GREGORY.          Would that the Khan again     Would come upon us, or Lithuania rise     Once more in insurrection. Good! I would then     Cross swords with them! Or what if the tsarevich     Should suddenly arise from out the grave,     Should cry, \"Where are ye, children, faithful servants?     Help me against Boris, against my murderer!

PALACE OF THE PATRIARCH    PATRIARCH, ABBOT of the Chudov Monastery       PATRIARCH. And he has run away, Father Abbot?       ABBOT. He has run away, holy sovereign, now three days ago.       PATRIARCH. Accursed rascal! What is his origin?       ABBOT. Of the family of the Otrepievs, of the lower nobility     of Galicia; in his youth he took the tonsure, no one     knows where, lived at Suzdal, in the Ephimievsky     monastery, departed from there, wandered to various     convents, finally arrived at my Chudov fraternity;     but I, seeing that he was still young and inexperienced,     entrusted him at the outset to Father Pimen, an old man,     kind and humble. And he was very learned, read our     chronicle, composed canons for the holy brethren; but,     to be sure, instruction was not given to him from the     Lord God--       PATRIARCH. Ah, those learned fellows! What a thing to     say, \"I shall be tsar in Moscow.\" Ah, he is a vessel of     the devil! However, it is no use even to report to the     tsar about this; why disquiet our father sovereign?     It will be enough to give information about his flight to     the Secretary Smirnov or the Secretary Ephimiev.     What a heresy: \"I shall be tsar in Moscow!\"...     Catch, catch the fawning villain, and send him to     Solovetsky to perpetual penance. But this--is it not     heresy, Father Abbot?       ABBOT. Heresy, holy Patriarch; downright heresy.

Ever he seeks to dip into the future,     Just like some pretty girl. Fain would I know     What 'tis he would foretell.       2ND ATTENDANT.             Well, here he comes.     Will it please you question him?       1ST ATTENDANT.                How grim he looks!       (Exeunt.)       TSAR. (Enters.) I have attained the highest power. Six years     Already have I reigned in peace; but joy     Dwells not within my soul. Even so in youth     We greedily desire the joys of love,     But only quell the hunger of the heart     With momentary possession. We grow cold,     Grow weary and oppressed! In vain the wizards     Promise me length of days, days of dominion     Immune from treachery--not power, not life     Gladden me; I forebode the wrath of Heaven     And woe. For me no happiness. I thought     To satisfy my people in contentment,     In glory, gain their love by generous gifts,     But I have put away that empty hope;     The power that lives is hateful to the mob,--     Only the dead they love. We are but fools     When our heart vibrates to the people's groans     And passionate wailing. Lately on our land     God sent a famine; perishing in torments     The people uttered moan. The granaries     I made them free of, scattered gold among them,     Found labour for them; furious for my pains     They cursed me! Next, a fire consumed their homes;     I built for them new dwellings; then forsooth     They blamed me for the fire! Such is the mob,     Such is its judgment! Seek its love, indeed!     I thought within my family to find     Solace; I thought to make my daughter happy     By wedlock. Like a tempest Death took off     Her bridegroom--and at once a stealthy rumour     Pronounced me guilty of my daughter's grief--     Me, me, the hapless father! Whoso dies,     I am the secret murderer of all;     I hastened Feodor's end, 'twas I that poisoned     My sister-queen, the lowly nun--all I!     Ah! Now I feel it; naught can give us peace     Mid worldly cares, nothing save only conscience!     Healthy she triumphs over wickedness,     Over dark slander; but if in her be found     A single casual stain, then misery.     With what a deadly sore my soul doth smart;     My heart, with venom filled, doth like a hammer     Beat in mine ears reproach; all things revolt me,     And my head whirls, and in my eyes are children     Dripping with blood; and gladly would I flee,     But nowhere can find refuge--horrible!
