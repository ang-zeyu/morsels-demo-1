Each link in the anchor-chains weighed 175  pounds. There were more than 2000 side-lights and windows to light the  public rooms and passenger cabins.    Nothing was left to chance in the construction of the Titanic. Three  million rivets (weighing 1200 tons) held the solid plates of steel  together. To insure stability in binding the heavy plates in the double  bottom, half a million rivets, weighing about 270 tons, were used.    All the plating of the hulls was riveted by hydraulic power, driving  seven-ton riveting machines, suspended from traveling cranes. The double  bottom extended the full length of the vessel, varying from 5 feet 3  inches to 6 feet 3 inches in depth, and lent added strength to the hull.      MOST LUXURIOUS STEAMSHIP    Not only was the Titanic the largest steamship afloat but it was the  most luxurious. Elaborately furnished cabins opened onto her eleven  decks, and some of these decks were reserved as private promenades that  were engaged with the best suites. One of these suites was sold for  $4350 for the boat's maiden and only voyage. Suites similar, but which  were without the private promenade decks, sold for $2300.    The Titanic differed in some respects from her sister ship. The Olympic  has a lower promenade deck, but in the Titanic's case the staterooms  were brought out flush with the outside of the superstructure, and the  rooms themselves made much larger. The sitting rooms of some of the  suites on this deck were 15 x 15 feet.    The restaurant was much larger than that of the Olympic and it had a  novelty in the shape of a private promenade deck on the starboard side,  to be used exclusively by its patrons. Adjoining it was a reception  room, where hosts and hostesses could meet their guests.    Two private promenades were connected with the two most luxurious suites  on the ship. The suites were situated about amidships, one on either  side of the vessel, and each was about fifty feet long. One of the  suites comprised a sitting room, two bedrooms and a bath.    These private promenades were expensive luxuries. The cost figured out  something like forty dollars a front foot for a six days' voyage. They,  with the suites to which they are attached, were the most expensive  transatlantic accommodations yet offered.      THE ENGINE ROOM    The engine room was divided into two sections, one given to the  reciprocating engines and the other to the turbines. There were two  sets of the reciprocating kind, one working each of the wing propellers  through a four-cylinder triple expansion, direct acting inverted engine.  Each set could generate 15,000 indicated horse-power at seventy-five  revolutions a minute. The Parsons type turbine takes steam from the  reciprocating engines, and by developing a horse-power of 16,000 at 165  revolutions a minute works the third of the ship's propellers, the one  directly under the rudder. Of the four funnels of the vessel three  were connected with the engine room, and the fourth or after funnel for  ventilating the ship including the gallery.    Practically all of the space on the Titanic below the upper deck  was occupied by steam-generating plant, coal bunkers and propelling  machinery. Eight of the fifteen water-tight compartments contained the  mechanical part of the vessel. There were, for instance, twenty-four  double end and five single end boilers, each 16 feet 9 inches in  diameter, the larger 20 feet long and the smaller 11 feet 9 inches long.  The larger boilers had six fires under each of them and the smaller  three furnaces. Coal was stored in bunker space along the side of the  ship between the lower and middle decks, and was first shipped from  there into bunkers running all the way across the vessel in the lowest  part. From there the stokers handed it into the furnaces.    One of the most interesting features of the vessel was the refrigerating  plant, which comprised a huge ice-making and refrigerating machine and  a number of provision rooms on the after part of the lower and orlop  decks. There were separate cold rooms for beef, mutton, poultry, game,  fish, vegetables, fruit, butter, bacon, cheese, flowers, mineral water,  wine, spirits and champagne, all maintained at different temperatures  most suitable to each. Perishable freight had a compartment of its own,  also chilled by the plant.    COMFORT AND STABILITY    Two main ideas were carried out in the Titanic. One was comfort and the  other stability. The vessel was planned to be an ocean ferry. She was  to have only a speed of twenty-one knots, far below that of some other  modern vessels, but she was planned to make that speed, blow high or  blow low, so that if she left one side of the ocean at a given time she  could be relied on to reach the other side at almost a certain minute of  a certain hour.    One who has looked into modern methods for safeguarding    {illust. caption = LIFE-BOAT AND DAVITS ON THE TITANIC    This diagram shows very clearly the arrangement of the life-boats and  the manner in which they were launched.}      a vessel of the Titanic type can hardly imagine an accident that could  cause her to founder. No collision such as has been the fate of any ship  in recent years, it has been thought up to this time, could send her  down, nor could running against an iceberg do it unless such an accident  were coupled with the remotely possible blowing out of a boiler. She  would sink at once, probably, if she were to run over a submerged rock  or derelict in such manner that both her keel plates and her double  bottom were torn away for more than half her length; but such a  catastrophe was so remotely possible that it did not even enter the  field of conjecture.    The reason for all this is found in the modern arrangement of  water-tight steel compartments into which all ships now are divided  and of which the Titanic had fifteen so disposed that half of them,  including the largest, could be flooded without impairing the safety  of the vessel. Probably it was the working of these bulkheads and the  water-tight doors between them as they are supposed to work that saved  the Titanic from foundering when she struck the iceberg.    These bulkheads were of heavy sheet steel and started at the very bottom  of the ship and extended right up to the top side. The openings in the  bulkheads were just about the size of the ordinary doorway, but the  doors did not swing as in a house, but fitted into water-tight grooves  above the opening. They could be released instantly in several ways,  and once closed formed a barrier to the water as solid as the bulkhead  itself.    In the Titanic, as in other great modern ships, these doors were held  in place above the openings by friction clutches. On the bridge was  a switch which connected with an electric magnet at the side of the  bulkhead opening. The turning of this switch caused the magnet to draw  down a heavy weight, which instantly released the friction clutch, and  allowed the door to fall or slide down over the opening in a second.  If, however, through accident the bridge switch was rendered useless the  doors would close automatically in a few seconds. This was arranged by  means of large metal floats at the side of the doorways, which rested  just above the level of the double bottom, and as the water entered  the compartments these floats would rise to it and directly release the  clutch holding the door open. These clutches could also be released by  hand.    It was said of the Titanic that liner compartments could be flooded  as far back or as far forward as the engine room and she would float,  though she might take on a heavy list, or settle considerably at one  end. To provide against just such an accident as she is said to have  encountered she had set back a good distance from the bows an extra  heavy cross partition known as the collision bulkhead, which would  prevent water getting in amidships, even though a good part of her bow  should be torn away. What a ship can stand and still float was shown a  few years ago when the Suevic of the White Star Line went on the rocks  on the British coast. The wreckers could not move the forward part of  her, so they separated her into two sections by the use of dynamite, and  after putting in a temporary bulkhead floated off the after half of  the ship, put it in dry dock and built a new forward part for her. More  recently the battleship Maine, or what was left of her, was floated out  to sea, and kept on top of the water by her water-tight compartments  only.        CHAPTER III. THE MAIDEN VOYAGE OF THE TITANIC    PREPARATIONS FOR THE VOYAGE--SCENES OF GAYETY--THE BOAT SAILS--INCIDENTS  OF THE VOYAGE---A COLLISION NARROWLY AVERTED--THE BOAT ON FIRE--WARNED  OF ICEBERGS.    EVER was ill-starred voyage more auspiciously begun than when the  Titanic, newly crowned empress of the seas, steamed majestically out of  the port of Southampton at noon on Wednesday, April 10th, bound for New  York.    Elaborate preparations had been made for the maiden voyage. Crowds  of eager watchers gathered to witness the departure, all the more  interested because of the notable people who were to travel aboard her.  Friends and relatives of many of the passengers were at the dock to bid  Godspeed to their departing loved ones. The passengers themselves were  unusually gay and happy.    Majestic and beautiful the ship rested on the water, marvel of  shipbuilding, worthy of any sea. As this new queen of the ocean moved  slowly from her dock, no one questioned her construction: she was fitted  with an elaborate system of      {illust. caption = STEAMER \"TITANIC\" COMPARED WITH THE LARGEST  STRUCTURES IN THE WORLD 1.

We couldn't do without them,\" agreed Mavis.    \"But they're not clever!\"    \"Um--I don't know! It depends what you call clever! They mayn't be B.A.'s  and all the rest of it, but they're well read, and they can sketch and  sing and play and do a hundred things that a great many graduates can't.  I call them 'cultured,' that's the right name for them. They're such  absolute and perfect ladies. It's a style you really don't meet every  day. And they're so pretty with their pink cheeks and their silver hair,  like the sweet old-fashioned pictures of eighteenth-century beauties in  powder and patches. I love to look at them, and to listen to the gentle  refined way they talk--I think they're adorable!\"    \"So they are--but you want something more in a school. I hope the fresh  teacher will be a regular sport, and that she'll use slang sometimes, and  play hockey. That's my ideal of a head mistress.\"    Miss Mitchell, the new peg upon which so much was now to depend at 'The  Moorings,' might not have been blamed for regarding Tuesday morning as  somewhat of an ordeal. If she was nervous, however, she managed to  conceal her feelings, and bore the introduction to her prospective pupils  with cheerful calm.    Forty-six girls, taking mental stock of her, decided instantly that she  was 'the right sort.' She was tall, in her middle twenties, had a fresh  complexion, light brown hair, a brisk decisive manner, and a pleasant  twinkle in her hazel eyes. She was evidently not in the least afraid of  her audience, a fact which at once gave her the right handle. She faced  their united stare smilingly.    \"I'm very pleased to meet you all!\" she began. \"I hope we shall work  together splendidly and have an extremely happy term. As Miss Pollard has  just told you, there have been so many changes at 'The Moorings' that it  is practically a new school. It's a tremendous opportunity to be able to  make a fresh start like this. We can make our own traditions and our own  rules. Some of you have been at the school before and some have been at  other schools, but I want you all to forget past traditions and unite  together to make 'The Moorings' the biggest success that can possibly be.  We're all going to love it and to be very loyal to it. We hope to do well  with our work, and well with our games. I must explain to you later about  all the various societies which we mean to start, but I want to tell you  that though there is plenty of work in front of you there's also plenty  of fun, and that if every girl makes up her mind to do her very best all  round we shall get on grandly. Now I am going to read out the lists of  the various forms, and then you can march away in turn to your own  classrooms.\"    In making her arrangements for the reorganisation of the school Miss  Mitchell had decided to have no Sixth form as yet. The girls were all  under seventeen, and she did not consider any of them sufficiently  advanced to be placed in so high a position. The Fifth was at present to  be the top form, and consisted of eleven girls, all of whom she intended  should work their uttermost and fit themselves for the honour of becoming  the Sixth a year later.    Mavis and Merle, both of whom were included in this elect eleven, walked  demurely away to their new classroom. Five of their old companions were  with them, Iva Westwood, Nesta Pitman, Aubrey Simpson, Muriel Burnitt,  and Edith Carey, and the remaining four consisted of Beata Castleton, Fay  Macleod, and two strangers, Sybil Vernon and Kitty Trefyre. Romola  Castleton had been placed in the Fourth, together with Maude Carey,  Babbie Williams, Nan Colville, Tattie Carew, and several other new girls.    The Fifth, as the top form, was to be mainly Miss Mitchell's; Miss  Barnes, the fresh assistant mistress, was to take the Fourth; and the  teaching of the three lower forms would be shared by Miss Hopkins,  Mademoiselle, and Miss Fanny Pollard. Lessons, on a first morning, are  usually more or less haphazard, but at any rate a beginning was made, the  pupils were entered on their class registers, their capacities were  tested, and they began in some slight degree to know their teachers.  Before the school separated at 12.30 for dinner Miss Pollard had an  announcement to make.    \"Miss Mitchell and I have decided that for the general good of the school  it will be wise to appoint four monitresses. Two of these must be  boarders and will be chosen by us, but the other two may be elected by  yourselves. We will have a ballot this afternoon. You may nominate any  girls you like by writing their names upon slips of paper and handing  them in to me before 2.30. All candidates, however, must be over the age  of fifteen and must have spent at least two previous terms at 'The  Moorings.' The voting will take place in the big schoolroom immediately  after four o'clock.\"    Mavis and Merle, walking home to lunch at Bridge House, discussed the  project eagerly as they went.    \"Good for Miss Pollard! Or I expect it's really Miss Mitchell who  suggested it! I call it a ripping idea. It's just exactly what's wanted.  The monitresses will lead the games and all the various societies. Run  the school, in fact. What sport!\" rejoiced Merle, with shining eyes. \"The  old 'Moorings' will really wake up at last.\"    \"Only four monitresses, and two of them are to be boarders and chosen by  the powers that be!\" mused Mavis. \"That means Iva and Nesta, if I know  anything of Miss Pollard and Miss Fanny! Now the question is who are to  be the other two lucky ones?\"    \"It ought to be somebody who could lead!\" flushed Merle. \"Somebody really  good at games and able to organise all that rabble of kids. Some one  who's been accustomed to a big school and knows what ought to be done.  Not girls who've spent all their lives in a tiny school like this.  They've no standards. I've often told them that! They've simply no idea  of how things used to swing at the Whinburn High!\"    \"I wish Miss Pollard and Miss Mitchell would have done all the choosing,\"  said Mavis anxiously. \"I think myself it's a mistake to put it to the  vote. Probably somebody quite unsuitable will be elected. The juniors  will plump for the girl they like best, without caring whether she knows  anything about games or not. There's Aubrey Simpson!\"    \"Oh! They _can't_ choose 'the jackdaw'!\" interrupted Merle.    \"They can choose her if they like. She's over fifteen and perfectly  eligible. Edith Carey is rather a favourite, I believe.\"    \"That silly goose! Good-night!\"    \"Well, there's Muriel Burnitt at any rate. She's been a long time at 'The  Moorings.'\"    \"All the worse for that, though she's better than Edith or Aubrey. I  shall vote for her myself, and for you.\"    \"And I'm going to vote for _you_, and for Muriel, because, as you  say, she's better than the others. I sincerely hope you'll win.\"    \"I hope we both shall. I'll nominate you if you'll nominate me!\"    \"Rather a family affair, isn't it? I think I'll ask first and see if  anybody else is going to give in our names. Perhaps Iva or Nesta may. It  would be much nicer than seeming to poke ourselves forward.\"    \"If we don't hustle a little we'll never get there! That's my opinion!  You're too good for this wicked world, Mavis! I've often told you so!\"  declared Merle, running into the house and putting down her books with a  slam. \"Angel girls are all very well at home, but school is a scrimmage  and it's those who fight who come up on top! Don't laugh! Oh, I enjoy  fighting! I tell you I want most desperately and tremendously to be made  a monitress, and if I'm not chosen, well--it will be the disappointment  of my life! I'm not joking! I mean it really and truly. I've set my heart  upon it.\"    Mavis, who had a very fine sense of the fitness of things, and who did  not think sisters should nominate one another, returned early to school  that afternoon and hunted up Iva Westwood. She found her very  enthusiastic about the election.    \"We've never had anything of the sort before at 'The Moorings,'\" purred  Iva. \"We're beginning to wake up here, aren't we? I'm going to give in  your name as a candidate, Mavis! I'm just writing it now.\"    \"Thanks! Won't you put Merle too?\"    \"Oh, I will if you like.\" (Iva's voice was not too enthusiastic.) \"I  suppose it doesn't matter how many we nominate. Somehow I never thought  of Merle.\"    \"She's a splendid leader, and A1 at games. You should have seen her at  Whinburn High!\"    \"Oh, I daresay! Well, to please you I'll put her name on my list. It can  do no harm at any rate.\"    \"Thanks ever so!\"    \"Old Muriel's canvassing like anything downstairs among the kids!\"    \"Is canvassing allowed?\"    \"Well, it hasn't been forbidden. Nesta and I are too proud to go and beg  for votes, but Mu doesn't care in the least; rather enjoys it, in fact.  She's sitting in the playroom, with Florrie Leach and Betty Marshall on  her knee, 'doing the popular,' and giving away whole packets of sweets.  If Merle really wants--hello! here's Merle herself!\"    Mavis turned quickly, for her younger sister, looking flushed and  excited, had burst suddenly into the room and was speaking eagerly.    \"Mavis! Have you a shilling in your pocket? I left my purse at home!  _Do_ lend it to me! What for? I want to tear out and buy some  sweets. Oh yes, I've time. I shall simply sprint. Hand it over, that's a  saintly girl! Thanks immensely!\"    Merle departed like a whirlwind, slamming the door after her. Iva  Westwood pulled an expressive grimace and laughed.    \"So she's trying the popular trick too! Well, sometimes it works and  sometimes it doesn't. I think Edith Carey has a good chance myself. The  kids are rather fond of her. Have you written your nominations yet,  Mavis? Then come along, and we'll drop them inside the box.\"    As the first bell rang at 2.25 and the girls began to assemble in the big"]]]
