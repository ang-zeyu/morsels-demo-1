AUTHOR'S NOTE      It may be guessed by some that I had a certain parish in my eye,  and this makes it proper I should add a word of disclamation.  In  my time there have been two ministers in that parish.  Of the first  I have a special reason to speak well, even had there been any to  think ill.  The second I have often met in private and long (in the  due phrase) \"sat under\" in his church, and neither here nor there  have I heard an unkind or ugly word upon his lips.  The preacher of  the text had thus no original in that particular parish; but when I  was a boy he might have been observed in many others; he was then  (like the schoolmaster) abroad; and by recent advices, it would  seem he has not yet entirely disappeared."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6167"],[0,"Business Hints for Men and Women (#3)"],[1,"ee.    The form of the mortgage is the same as that of a deed, except  that it contains a clause called the Defeasance, which states that  when the obligation has been met the document shall be void.    MORTGAGES MUST BE RECORDED    The forms for \"signing, sealing and delivering\" a mortgage, are  the same as with a deed.    A mortgage must be recorded the same as a deed, the mortgagee  paying the fees.    Chattel mortgages are filed and recorded in the same way, except  that it is not usual to make copies of the instrument. They are  described in books prepared for the purpose.    A wife need not join her husband in making the note secured by a  mortgage, but if she agrees to the transaction it is necessary for  her to sign the mortgage; however, some states do not require  this.    PAYMENTS    Often a life insurance policy is used as security for the payment  of a mortgage.    The mortgagee, if there be buildings on the property, should see  that the buildings are insured and that the policy or policies are  made out in his name.    If the insurance policy is in the mortgagor's name he may collect  and keep the insurance money.    The mortgagor must meet, as stipulated, every payment of the  principal and interest.    Failure to meet one payment can result in a legal foreclosure.    When a payment is made, the date and the amount must be entered on  the back of the note. This should be done in the presence of the  mortgagor.    If possible always pay the obligation by check.    If a payment is accepted on a mortgage and the amount is not  sufficient to meet the sum required, the interest is first settled  in full, the rest is credited to the principal.    When the full amount, with interest, is paid in, it becomes the  duty of the mortgagee to have the mortgage \"discharged.\"    A complete settlement is when, all payments being made, the  mortgagee surrenders the note and its security, and causes to be  written by the register, on the margin of the copy in his books,  the words, \"discharged,\" or \"satisfied,\" affixing thereto his  official signature and the date.    ASSIGNMENTS    A mortgage is regarded in law as personal property.    A mortgage need not remain in the hands of the mortgagee in order  to be valid. It can be sold like bonds, stocks or other property,  and there are men who deal only in that form of security.    In order to sell a mortgage, the owner must make, to the  purchaser, what is known as an \"assignment of mortgage.\"    The assignment should be recorded in the same way as the original  mortgage, the assignee paying the fee.    REDEMPTION OF MORTGAGES    While the rule as to the redemption of mortgages remains the same  in some localities that it formerly was, the law in most places is  now more lenient.    Now the mortgagor who has failed is usually given by law an  extension of time in which to make good the payment of principal  and interest.    Lenders, when the interest is met, are content to let the mortgage  run on as an investment, though it will often be found, in such  cases, that it is better to make a new mortgage.    EQUITY OF REDEMPTION    Where the payments on a mortgage have not been met and the  instrument has not been foreclosed, the mortgagor has still what  is known as an \"equity of redemption.\"    In some states after the foreclosure of the mortgage and the sale  of the property there is still a period of redemption of from  sixty days to six years.    The mode of foreclosure differs in some states. The usual method  is to foreclose on an order from the court, and to have the sale  conducted by a court officer.    The proceeds from the sale are used to pay the principal,  interests and costs. If there is money left over it is paid to the  mortgagor, whose interests in the property are then at an end.    Many people, not familiar with business methods, are inclined to  regard a mortgage as something of a disgrace, when, as a matter of  fact it is a most usual and honorable means of raising money for  the securing of a home or the conducting of a business.    Nearly all of the great railroads of the country have been built  by the sale of the mortgage bonds, which are usually renewed when  due, and are sought out as a safe and sane form of investment.    The fact that a mortgage payment has to be met on a farm is often  in itself the strongest inducement to industry and economy.          CHAPTER IV    WILLS        Whether farmer, manufacturer, merchant or professional man, and  whether in youth, mid-age or declining years, every owner of  personal or real property, or both, should make a will.    If you have not made a will, get over the foolish notion that it  is a premonition of death, and do so at once.    A will is a written and signed declaration of the disposition one  wishes to have made of his property in the event of his death.    The maker of a valid will must be of sound mind and not less than  twenty-one years of age.    Women, whether married or single, if of proper age, are competent  to make a will.    OF TWO KINDS    A will may be written or unwritten.    Unwritten wills are known as \"nun-cupative.\" Nun-cupative wills  are employed only when through accident, or sudden seizure by a  fatal disease, the time necessary to write and sign a will cannot  be had.    The unwritten will must be authenticated by reliable and  unprejudiced witnesses, and generally it can dispose of personal  property only.    In the written will no precise form is necessary, though when  drawn by a lawyer it usually begins with some such form as: \"I,  George Brown, being of sound mind and good understanding, do make  and declare this to be my last will and testament\", etc.    A will is not necessarily permanent. It may be cancelled or  changed in any way by the maker before his death, or a new will  can be made.    The last will cancels all preceding wills.    An addition to an existing will is known as a \"codicil.\"    A man making a will is called a testator.    A woman making a will is called a testatrix.    LIMITATIONS OF WILLS    A man has a right to dispose of his property by will or gift as he  chooses, but if he is married the law compels him to consider the  rights of another.    The husband cannot, by will or otherwise, deprive his wife of her  \"right of dower\" in his real estate and appurtenances.    Unless she chooses to accept, the wife need not accept other  property that is bequeathed her in lieu of dower.    The wife's dower interest in her husband's estate is a life  interest only. On her death it goes to the husband's heirs, as if  there had been no widow.    In some states there is no right of dower.    HOW TO MAKE A WILL    The will not only shows the purpose of the testator, but it serves  as a bar to litigation among the natural heirs.    Any man or woman can write out his or her will, but unless quite  familiar with such work it is better to employ a lawyer for the  purpose.    The person named in the will to carry out the purpose of the  testator is known as the \"executor\".    No person, not twenty-one at the time the will is proved can act  as an executor.    Neither a convict, an imbecile, nor one known to be a drug fiend  or an habitual drunkard, is eligible for the post of an executor.  If an executor be appointed against his will, the law does not  compel him to serve.    There must be at least two witnesses to a will, some states  require three.    The witnesses need not know the contents of the will, but they  must understand before signing that it is a will, and they must  see it signed by the testator.    Under the common law the will is void if the witnesses are  beneficiaries.    In some states a will so witnessed is valid, except that the  witnesses cannot receive their legacies.    All the witnesses should sign at the same time and add their  addresses.    If an heir at law, say a child, is not mentioned in the will, the  law assumes that he was forgotten by the testator and generally  gives the share the heir would be entitled to if there were no  will.    At the end of the will the testator, in the presence of the  witnesses, should write his name in full.    AN EXECUTOR'S DUTIES    An executor is the legal representative of the testator. It is his  duty to see that the provisions of the will are carried out.    No man is qualified to act as executor who is not competent to  make a will. Executors, unless relieved by the provisions of the  will, are required to file bonds, proportioned to the value of the  estate, for the faithful performance of their duties.    Should there be no executor named in the will, or if the person so  named refuses to act, or if he dies or resigns, the court will  appoint a person to act in his place.    The executor appointed by the court is known or called an  \"administrator with the will annexed.\"    In some states the court having jurisdiction of wills and estates  of deceased is known as \"the probate,\" in others it is called the  \"Surrogate's Court,\" and in still others, \"The Orphan's.\"    ADMINISTRATORS AND THEIR DUTIES    If a man, owning property, dies without making a will, the judge  of the proper court will appoint an administrator to settle the  estate.    This is the method of procedure:    1. A person, interested in getting the estate settled, goes before  the proper judge and asks him to appoint an administrator.  2. The administrator must give the same bond as an executor. Their  duties are the same.  3. In settling the estate the administrator is governed by the  law, and by the special directions of the officer having  jurisdiction in such matters.  4. He must make a careful list of all the property belonging to  the estate. The value of the personal property is estimated by men  specially appointed by the court for the purpose and known as  \"appraisers\".  5. The administrator must account for every item of property that  comes into his possession.  6. All debts of deceased must be first paid,"]]]
