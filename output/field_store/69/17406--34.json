Preliminary to a brief consideration of these several subjects, I  desire to say a word as to the reception of the Latter-day Saints by  the people of Illinois, and the conditions prevailing in that state at  the time of their arrival. A knowledge of these conditions is necessary  to the understanding of this whole Illinois period of the History of  the Church.    Much has been made of the hospitality which the people of Illinois  extended to the Latter-day Saints at the time of their expulsion from  Missouri. A writer in the _American Historical Magazine_ for July,  1906, says: \"To the latter state [Illinois] they [the Saints] went  in 1839, and were received with such open-armed hospitality as only  a very generous and liberty-loving people can extend to those whom  they honestly believe to be suffering from a wrongful oppression.  The conduct of the Saints in five years turned this feeling of  extraordinarily deep-seated sympathy, inducing great practical  charities, into a feeling of very bitter hatred, threatening to break  into mob violence.\" Far be it from me to depreciate the kindness of  those who extended a helping hand to the Saints in the hour of their  distress.

This volume deals with the History of the Church from May 3, 1842, to  31st of August, 1843. It, therefore, covers a period of about sixteen  months. The main external events may be set down as follows: First,  exposure of the wickedness of John C. Bennett, and his departure from  Nauvoo; (2) the charge against the Prophet Joseph of complicity in an  attempted assassination of Ex-governor Lilburn W. Boggs, under whose  celebrated exterminating order the body of the Church was driven from  Missouri: (3) the attempt of the state of Missouri to extradite the  Prophet from the state of Illinois, to be tried as an accessory before  the fact to an assault on ex-Governor Boggs; (4) a second attempt  on the part of Missouri to extradite the Prophet from the state of  Illinois on the old charge of \"murder, treason, burglary, arson,  larceny, theft and stealing,\" first brought against him in the year  1838; (5) a preliminary prospecting of the West, doubtless with a view  to the contemplated removal of the Saints to the Rocky Mountains.    Of events that relate more nearly to the Church as an organization  there should be mentioned: (1) the introduction of the endowment  ceremonies and enlarged instruction on the subject of baptism for the  dead; (2) an extension of auxiliary organization by bringing into  existence the Young Men's and Women's Society.    Another item of great interest in this volume is the manifest  development of the character and spiritual strength of the Prophet  during this period. The trying experiences through which he passed  seemed to discover new qualities of soul power within him, and to  emphasize those which he was known to have possessed.    The doctrinal development of the period covered by this volume deals  with several items which may be regarded as preliminary to that richer  unfolding of philosophical thought to which the last year of the  Prophet's teaching was so largely devoted. Let us now consider these  several items more in detail.    _Dr. John C. Bennett_.    At the first glance it may be difficult to comprehend how a character  like John C. Bennett could find favor and place with the Church  of {XVIII} Christ. There is a strong temptation, when the whole  truth about this man is known, to regard him as an adventurer and a  wicked man from the beginning. But those who had, perhaps, the best  opportunity to know him held that his motives for coming to Nauvoo  were honest, that his intentions in life at that time were honorable,  but that he fell into transgression and would not repent. Such were  the views of John Taylor, who was closely associated with Bennett in  affairs at Nauvoo (see foot note, pages 80 and 81 this volume); and  the Lord in the revelation given on the 19th of January, 1841, accepts  of him and speaks approvingly of Bennett's love for the work: \"And for  his love he shall be great. * * * * * I have seen the work which he  hath done, which I accept, _if he continue_, and will crown him with  blessings and great glory.\" (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 124:17.)    It cannot be otherwise, then, but that John C. Bennett in coming to  the Saints did so out of love for the work, had a desire to work  righteousness but was among those who failed--he did not \"continue\"  in his right intentions. It is possible even for men whose lives  are not above reproach to feel indignation at acts of injustice,  such as was perpetrated upon the Latter-day Saints by the state of  Missouri; and sure it is that John C. Bennett expressed himself very  pronouncedly against the injustice suffered by the Church at the  hands of the officers and people of that state, and he \"proffered his  military knowledge and prowess\" to the Saints while the latter were  yet in Missouri, but undergoing expulsion. His proposal was to go  to their assistance with all the forces he could raise in Illinois,  as \"his bosom swelled with indignation\" at the treatment the Saints  were receiving at the hands of the cruel and cowardly Missourians.  That proffered service, however, was not accepted; doubtless because  the Saints depended for vindication of their reputation, and redress  of their wrongs upon the officers of the state and nation, rather  than upon incensed persons, however sincere and well meaning, who  offered their service to wage war upon their enemies. But after the  Saints began gathering at Commerce, Bennett again expressed a desire  to connect his fortunes with them. When he contemplated removing to  Commerce, he held the position of quartermaster-general in the militia  of the state of Illinois, a position he did not wish to resign. Indeed  he expressed a desire to hold the position for a number of years. He  was also a physician with an extensive practice, and forwarded extracts  to the Prophet from the _Louisville Courier-Journal_ which gave  evidence of high standing in his profession. Writing of these things to  Joseph, he said:        I do not expect to resign my office of quartermaster-general of      the state of Illinois, in the event of my removal to Commerce,      unless you advise otherwise. I shall likewise expect to practice      my profession, but {XIX} at the same time your people shall have      all the benefit of my speaking powers, and my untiring energies in      behalf of the good and holy faith.
