Verse 16.--Even so the blood of Christ      atoneth for their sins.        Alma 21:9.--Now Aaron began to open the Scriptures unto them      concerning the coming of Christ, and also concerning the      resurrection of the dead, and that there could be no redemption for      mankind, save it was through the death and suffering of Christ, and      the atonement of his blood.        I Nephi 12:10.--Their garments are made white in his blood.        II Nephi 9:7.--And if so, (not an infinite atonement) this flesh      must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to      rise no more.    From the Bible:        Mark 14:22-25.--And as they did eat, Jesus took bread and blessed      and brake it, and gave to them, and said: Take, eat; this is my      body.        And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to      them: and they all drank of it.        And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament which      is shed for many.        Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the      vine, until that day that I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.    From the Doctrine and Covenants:        Section 45:4.--(Utah edition) Saying, Father, behold the sufferings      and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased;      behold the blood of thy Son which was shed--the blood of him whom      thou gavest that thyself might be glorified.        Section 74:7.--But little children are holy, being sanctified      through the atonement of Jesus Christ, and this is what the      scriptures mean.        Section 76:39-41.--For all the rest shall be brought forth by the      resurrection of the dead, through the triumph and the glory of the      Lamb, who was slain, who was in the bosom of the Father before the      worlds were made. And this is the gospel, the glad tidings which      the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us. That he came into      the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and to bear      the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it      from all unrighteousness.        Section 29:1.--Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ, your Redeemer,      the Great I AM, whose arm of mercy hath atoned for your sins. Verse      17.--And it shall come to pass, because of the wickedness of the      world, that I will take vengeance upon the wicked, for they will      not repent; for the cup of mine indignation is full; for behold, my      blood shall not cleanse them if they hear me not.      STATEMENT OF AN ENEMY    But the report says: \"This doctrine was introduced by Brigham Young\"  and that it meant \"death to anyone who left the Church * * * that  the apostate whose throat was cut from ear to ear * * * saved his  soul.\" Why you made this statement you best know; but were you not  aware that it was but the repetition of the ravings of enemies of the  Church, without one grain of truth? Did you not know that not a single  individual was ever \"blood atoned,\" as you are pleased to call it, for  apostasy or any other cause? Were you not aware, in repeating this  false charge, that it was made by the most bitter enemies of the Church  before the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith? Do you know of anyone  whose blood was ever shed by the command of the Church, or members  thereof, to \"save his soul?\" Did you not know that you were embittering  the people against the \"Mormon\" Elders, and that just such malicious  charges and false insinuations have made martyrs for the Church, whose  blood does not \"cease to come up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth?\"    Never in the history of this people can the time be pointed to when  the Church ever attempted to pass judgment on, or execute an apostate  as per your statement. There are men living in Utah today who left the  Church in the earliest history of our State who feel as secure, and are  just as secure and free from molestation from their former associates  as you or any other man could be.      EFFICACY OF THE BLOOD OF CHRIST    The Latter-day Saints believe in the efficacy of the blood of Christ.  They believe that through obedience to the laws and ordinances of the  Gospel they obtain a remission of sins; but this could not be if Christ  had not died for _them_. If you did believe in blood atonement, I might  ask you why the blood of Christ was shed? and _in whose stead was it  shed_? I might ask you to explain the words of Paul: \"Without shedding  of blood is no remission.\"      UNPARDONABLE SINS    Are you aware that there are certain sins that man may commit for which  the atoning blood of Christ does not avail? Do you not know, too, that  this doctrine is taught in the Book of Mormon? And is not this further  reason why you should discard the Book as well as the name? Is it not  safe for us to rely upon the scriptures for the solution of problems of  this kind? Let me quote:    From the Book of Mormon:        II Nephi 9:35.--Wo unto the murderer who deliberately killeth, for      he shall die.        Alma 1:13, 14.--And thou hast shed the blood of a righteous man,      yea, a man who has done much good among this people; and were we to      spare thee, his blood would come upon us for vengeance.        Alma 42:19.--Now, if there were no law given--if a man murdered he      should die, would he be afraid he would die if he should murder?    From the Bible:        Genesis 9:12, 13.--And whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his      blood be shed; for man shall not shed the blood of man.        For a commandment I give, that every man's brother shall preserve      the life of man, for in mine own image have I made man. (Inspired      translation.)        Luke 11:50.--That the blood of all the prophets, which was      shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this      generation.        Hebrews 9:22.--And almost all things are by the law purged with      blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.        Hebrews 10:26-29.--For if we sin wilfully, after that we have      received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more      sacrifice for sins.        * * * *        He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three      witnesses;        Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought      worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath      counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an      unholy thing.        (I commend to you the careful reading of these two chapters:)        I John 3:15.--No murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.        I John 5:16.--If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not      unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that      sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he      shall pray for it.    From the Doctrine and Covenants:        Section 87:7.--That the cry of the saints, and of the blood of      the saints, shall cease to come up into the ears of the Lord of      Sabbath, from the earth, to be avenged of their enemies.        Section 101:80.--And for this purpose have I established the      constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men, whom I raised      up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of      blood.        Section 42:18, 19.--And now, behold, I speak unto the church. Thou      shalt not kill; and he that kills shall not have forgiveness in      this world, nor in the world to come.        And again, I say, thou shalt not kill; but he that killeth shall      die.        Verse 79.--And it shall come to pass, that if any persons among you      shall kill, they shall be delivered up and dealt with according to      the laws of the land; for remember that he hath no forgiveness, and      it shall be proved according to the laws of the land.      THE LAW OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT    In pursuance of, and in harmony with this scriptural doctrine, which  has been the righteous law from the days of Adam to the present  time, the founders of Utah incorporated in the laws of the Territory  provisions for the capital punishment of those who wilfully shed the  blood of their fellow man. This law, which is now the law of the State,  granted unto the condemned murderer the privilege of choosing for  himself whether he die by hanging, or whether he be shot, and thus have  his blood shed in harmony with the law of God; and thus atone, so far  as it is in his power to atone, for the death of his victim. Almost  without exception the condemned party chooses the latter death. This  is by the authority of the law of the land, not that of the Church.  This law was placed on the statutes through the efforts of the \"Mormon\"  legislators, and grants to the accused the right of jury trial. It is  from this that the vile charge, which you are pleased to repeat, has  been maliciously misconstrued by the enemies of the Church, who prefer  to believe a lie. When men accuse the Church of practicing \"blood  atonement\" on those who deny the faith, or, for that matter, on any  living creature, they know that they bear false witness, and they shall  stand condemned before the judgment seat of God.      PLURAL MARRIAGE    Since the action taken by the United States government, and also by the  Church, in regard to plural marriage, I shall not discuss its virtues  nor answer arguments in opposition to that principle as a principle of  our faith. As you, however, are reported to have said that \"Brigham  Young introduced\" that doctrine \"in Salt Lake City,\" I would be pleased  if you would explain, as a matter of history, why Sidney Rigdon, before  \"President Young introduced\" the doctrine, declared that the principle  of plural marriage was introduced, to his knowledge, by Joseph Smith  the Prophet, and that he, Sidney Rigdon, rejected that doctrine and  \"warned Joseph Smith and his family\" that it would bring ruin upon  them.

And they would have had no children; wherefore, they  would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they  knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin. But behold, all  things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things. Adam  fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy\" (2 Ne.  2:22-25).    This passage, of course, refers directly to Adam's condition in the  Garden of Eden, and not to the spirit life preceding that period of  innocent ignorance. But the fact remains that man, in the spirit life,  needed experience in mortality, in order to become wiser, as much as he  needed a body for purposes of progression and eternal increase.    Adam Not Deceived.--When Adam and Eve partook of the forbidden fruit,  it was the woman who was beguiled by Satan and induced to go contrary  to the divine command. The man was not deceived. Adam was but telling  the truth when he answered the Lord, \"The woman whom thou gavest to be  with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat\" (Gen. 3:12). Those  who satirize Father Adam for this reply, imputing to him an unworthy  motive, a desire to evade responsibility and \"hide behind the woman in  the case,\" take but a superficial view of the subject. Adam was not  trying to evade the issue: he was simply stating the fact. The Lord  wanted the truth, and no fable would suffice, however polite, in the  opinion of shallow wits or would-be chivalrous wisacres, it might have  been to invent one, in order to shield the fair transgressor.    A Deliberate Transgression.--Adam, after Eve had transgressed, did  likewise in order to carry out a divine command previously given--the  command to multiply and replenish the earth (Gen. 1:28). Eve, by her  act, had separated herself from her husband, and made it impossible,  unless he followed her and also became mortal, to carry out God's  original behest. This was Adam's motive. He was facing a dilemma. He  must make choice between two divine commands, and doubtless felt that  he could not consistently do otherwise than as he did. He disobeyed in  order to obey, retrieving, so far as he possibly could, the situation  resulting from Eve's disobedience. He did it wittingly, deliberately,  undeceived as to the consequences, realizing that in no other way  could he carry out God's first command and become the progenitor of  the human race. Adam and Eve, with their eyes open, rejoiced over  what had befallen them, recognizing it as part of a preordained plan  to people the earth with their posterity, and afford to a world of  waiting spirits the opportunity, long anticipated, of taking earthly  tabernacles and starting out upon their great pilgrimage to perfection.    Adam and Eve Rejoice.--\"And in that day Adam blessed God and was  filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth,  saying: Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my  eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the  flesh I shall see God.    \"And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were  it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never  should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the  eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.\"--(\"Pearl of Great  Price,\" Book of Moses, 5:10,11.)    \"Adam fell that man might be, and man is that he might have joy.\"  But there would be no joy, no progress, no eternal life for fallen  man--only pain, sorrow, and everlasting banishment from God's presence,  had Christ not died to nullify the ill effects of Adam's act, and lift  man up from his fallen condition.    Human Standards and Divine Dispensations.--Why, it may be asked, did  God place Adam and Eve in so seemingly contradictory a position? Why  were they forbidden to do what they had manifestly come to do, and  which had to be done in order to carry out the divine purpose? For that  is the problem in a nutshell, as it appears to human eyes. I can only  answer in the words of Nephi: \"All things have been done in the wisdom  of him who knoweth all things.\" Man cannot sit in judgment upon his  Maker, nor measure by human standards divine dispensations. The God who  gives life, and takes it, without committing murder, can command today  and countermand tomorrow, and yet remain consistent and unchangeable.  In a world where faith is necessary to progress, and where premature  knowledge would prevent progress by swallowing up faith, by destroying  the opportunity for its exercise, man must not expect to know all  things. That calamities and sacrifices bring forth blessings, is  apparent to observation and experience; but the deep why and wherefore  of it all remains a mystery. Adam's fall and Christ's atonement were  fearful calamities, from the human point of view; but wonderful  benefits and advantages accrued therefrom. Just why such sacrifices  have to be made, however, in order that such blessings may come, is too  profound a problem for the finite mind to solve.    Spiritual and Temporal Death.--The fall brought man into the  world--into this state of mortality; but it also brought death, with  all its sad concomitants. Not such a death as the righteous now  contemplate, and such as both righteous and unrighteous must undergo,  as a change preparatory to resurrection. There was no resurrection when  Adam fell--not upon this planet--nothing but death, resting like a pall  over the prospective human race. Adam and Eve, after the fall, were  spiritually dead, and were doomed to the temporal death as well--the  dissolution of the body--and they had entailed this fate upon their  posterity. Hell had triumphed over man's, or rather woman's, weakness.  Life was dead, death reigned, and demons held high carnival.    The World in Pawn.--Adam's transgression had put the world in pawn.  The name of the pawnbroker was death, and his claim was twofold. Death  held all things in his grasp, and there was no help for it this side  of heaven. No part of what had been pledged could be used as the means  of redemption. Adam could not redeem himself, great and mighty as he  was--in the spirit; for he was no other than Michael the archangel,  leader of the hosts of heaven. But this puissant Michael was now  a weak, frail, mortal man, under the penalty of a broken law, and  powerless to repair the injury that had been wrought. He and the race  that was to spring from him were utterly lost, unless the Almighty One  would intervene, and do for them what they could not do for themselves.  If man could have redeemed himself, it would have been required of  him; but because self-redemption was impossible, a Redeemer had to be  provided.    The Redemption.--Redemption must come, if at all, through some Being  high enough and powerful enough to make an infinite atonement, one  fully covering the far-reaching effects of the original transgression.  The scales of eternal justice, unbalanced by Adam's act, had to be  repoised, and right's equilibrium restored. Who could do this? Who  could retrieve the situation, bring good out of evil, mould failure  into success, and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat? Where was the  Moses for such an exodus? Where the deliverance from this worse than  Egyptian bondage--a bondage of which Egypt's slavery was but typical?    The life of a God was the price of the world's freedom, and that price  was paid by the God of Israel, who descended from his glorious throne,  made himself mortal, an exile of eternity, walked in the dust of his  own footstool, and by submitting to death, broke the bands of death,  and made it possible for man to live again, and go on to the goal of  endless glory. He was the Lamb \"without spot or blemish,\" typified by  the lamb of the Passover, and preordained for sacrifice, to \"take away  the sins of the world.\" He gave himself as an offering, as a ransom for  human redemption, and by the shedding of his own blood, paid the debt  of the universe, took the world out of pawn, and became the Author of  Salvation for all mankind.        CHAPTER IV.    The Gods in Council.    Fore-ordination.--The parts played by Adam and Eve in this sublime  tragedy were doubtless cast at the same time that the pre-eminent  role was assigned to the Redeemer and Savior. Likewise, is it just  as reasonable to infer that other great ones were forechosen for  service in the cause of humanity. It is more than an inference; it is  a revealed fact. What other meaning can be attached to the word of the  Lord to Jeremiah (1:5): \"Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee;  and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I  ordained thee a prophet unto the nations\"? If this be true of Jeremiah,  why not true of other prophets, both ancient and modern? Joseph Smith  is on record as saying that men who have such callings to minister to  the inhabitants of the world, were \"ordained to that very purpose in  the grand council of heaven before this world was\" (\"Compendium,\" p.  285).    Two Plans Proposed.--In that same Grand Council--the \"congregation  of the mighty\" (Ps. 1:5)--there were two candidates, if we may so  designate them, for the redeemership. One was like unto the Father,  desiring for the pure love of God's children to uplift them, and at the  same time glorify the Great Head, by the sacrifice that he proposed  to make. The other was proud, self-willed, and bent upon personal  aggrandizement, regardless of consequences. The former stood for  freedom--man's agency--and the rewarding of all souls according to  their works. The latter proposed coercion, so that not one soul should  be lost; thinking, perhaps, that his demanded compensation for proposed  service might be made in that way all the more abundant.
