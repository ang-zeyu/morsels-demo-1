We are lost.  They will turn our own science  against us.\"    \"No they won't.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because I and a handful of the faithful have blocked that game.  I'll tell you what I've done, and what moved me to it.  Smart as  you are, the Church was smarter.  It was the Church that sent  you cruising--through her servants, the doctors.\"    \"Clarence!\"    \"It is the truth.  I know it.  Every officer of your ship was  the Church's picked servant, and so was every man of the crew.\"    \"Oh, come!\"    \"It is just as I tell you.  I did not find out these things at once,  but I found them out finally.  Did you send me verbal information,  by the commander of the ship, to the effect that upon his return  to you, with supplies, you were going to leave Cadiz--\"    \"Cadiz!  I haven't been at Cadiz at all!\"    \"--going to leave Cadiz and cruise in distant seas indefinitely,  for the health of your family?  Did you send me that word?\"    \"Of course not.  I would have written, wouldn't I?\"    \"Naturally.  I was troubled and suspicious.  When the commander  sailed again I managed to ship a spy with him.  I have never  heard of vessel or spy since.  I gave myself two weeks to hear  from you in.  Then I resolved to send a ship to Cadiz.  There was  a reason why I didn't.\"    \"What was that?\"    \"Our navy had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared!  Also, as  suddenly and as mysteriously, the railway and telegraph and  telephone service ceased, the men all deserted, poles were cut  down, the Church laid a ban upon the electric light!  I had to be  up and doing--and straight off.  Your life was safe--nobody in  these kingdoms but Merlin would venture to touch such a magician  as you without ten thousand men at his back--I had nothing to  think of but how to put preparations in the best trim against your  coming.  I felt safe myself--nobody would be anxious to touch  a pet of yours.  So this is what I did.  From our various works  I selected all the men--boys I mean--whose faithfulness under  whatsoever pressure I could swear to, and I called them together  secretly and gave them their instructions.  There are fifty-two of  them; none younger than fourteen, and none above seventeen years old.\"    \"Why did you select boys?\"    \"Because all the others were born in an atmosphere of superstition  and reared in it.  It is in their blood and bones.  We imagined  we had educated it out of them; they thought so, too; the Interdict  woke them up like a thunderclap!  It revealed them to themselves,  and it revealed them to me, too.  With boys it was different.  Such  as have been under our training from seven to ten years have had  no acquaintance with the Church's terrors, and it was among these  that I found my fifty-two.  As a next move, I paid a private visit  to that old cave of Merlin's--not the small one--the big one--\"    \"Yes, the one where we secretly established our first great electric  plant when I was projecting a miracle.\"    \"Just so.  And as that miracle hadn't become necessary then,  I thought it might be a good idea to utilize the plant now.  I've  provisioned the cave for a siege--\"    \"A good idea, a first-rate idea.\"    \"I think so.  I placed four of my boys there as a guard--inside,  and out of sight.  Nobody was to be hurt--while outside; but any  attempt to enter--well, we said just let anybody try it!  Then  I went out into the hills and uncovered and cut the secret wires  which connected your bedroom with the wires that go to the dynamite  deposits under all our vast factories, mills, workshops, magazines,  etc., and about midnight I and my boys turned out and connected  that wire with the cave, and nobody but you and I suspects where  the other end of it goes to.  We laid it under ground, of course, and  it was all finished in a couple of hours or so.  We sha'n't have  to leave our fortress now when we want to blow up our civilization.\"    \"It was the right move--and the natural one; military necessity,  in the changed condition of things.  Well, what changes _have_ come!  We expected to be besieged in the palace some time or other, but  --however, go on.\"    \"Next, we built a wire fence.\"    \"Wire fence?\"    \"Yes.  You dropped the hint of it yourself, two or three years ago.\"    \"Oh, I remember--the time the Church tried her strength against  us the first time, and presently thought it wise to wait for a  hopefuler season.  Well, how have you arranged the fence?\"    \"I start twelve immensely strong wires--naked, not insulated  --from a big dynamo in the cave--dynamo with no brushes except  a positive and a negative one--\"    \"Yes, that's right.\"    \"The wires go out from the cave and fence in a circle of level  ground a hundred yards in diameter; they make twelve independent  fences, ten feet apart--that is to say, twelve circles within  circles--and their ends come into the cave again.\"    \"Right; go on.\"    \"The fences are fastened to heavy oaken posts only three feet apart,  and these posts are sunk five feet in the ground.\"    \"That is good and strong.\"    \"Yes.  The wires have no ground-connection outside of the cave.  They go out from the positive brush of the dynamo; there is a  ground-connection through the negative brush; the other ends of  the wire return to the cave, and each is grounded independently.\"    \"No, no, that won't do!\"    \"Why?\"    \"It's too expensive--uses up force for nothing.  You don't want  any ground-connection except the one through the negative brush.  The other end of every wire must be brought back into the cave  and fastened independently, and _without_ any ground-connection.  Now, then, observe the economy of it.  A cavalry charge hurls  itself against the fence; you are using no power, you are spending  no money, for there is only one ground-connection till those horses  come against the wire; the moment they touch it they form a  connection with the negative brush _through the ground_, and drop  dead.  Don't you see?--you are using no energy until it is needed;  your lightning is there, and ready, like the load in a gun; but  it isn't costing you a cent till you touch it off.  Oh, yes, the  single ground-connection--\"    \"Of course!  I don't know how I overlooked that.  It's not only  cheaper, but it's more effectual than the other way, for if wires  break or get tangled, no harm is done.\"    \"No, especially if we have a tell-tale in the cave and disconnect  the broken wire.  Well, go on.  The gatlings?\"    \"Yes--that's arranged.  In the center of the inner circle, on a  spacious platform six feet high, I've grouped a battery of thirteen  gatling guns, and provided plenty of ammunition.\"    \"That's it.  They command every approach, and when the Church's  knights arrive, there's going to be music.  The brow of the  precipice over the cave--\"    \"I've got a wire fence there, and a gatling.  They won't drop any  rocks down on us.\"    \"Well, and the glass-cylinder dynamite torpedoes?\"    \"That's attended to.  It's the prettiest garden that was ever  planted.  It's a belt forty feet wide, and goes around the outer  fence--distance between it and the fence one hundred yards--kind of  neutral ground that space is.  There isn't a single square yard  of that whole belt but is equipped with a torpedo.  We laid them  on the surface of the ground, and sprinkled a layer of sand over  them.  It's an innocent looking garden, but you let a man start  in to hoe it once, and you'll see.\"    \"You tested the torpedoes?\"    \"Well, I was going to, but--\"    \"But what?  Why, it's an immense oversight not to apply a--\"    \"Test?  Yes, I know; but they're all right; I laid a few in the  public road beyond our lines and they've been tested.\"    \"Oh, that alters the case.  Who did it?\"    \"A Church committee.\"    \"How kind!\"    \"Yes.  They came to command us to make submission.  You see they  didn't really come to test the torpedoes; that was merely an incident.\"    \"Did the committee make a report?\"    \"Yes, they made one.  You could have heard it a mile.\"    \"Unanimous?\"    \"That was the nature of it.  After that I put up some signs, for the  protection of future committees, and we have had no intruders since.\"    \"Clarence, you've done a world of work, and done it perfectly.\"    \"We had plenty of time for it; there wasn't any occasion for hurry.\"    We sat silent awhile, thinking.  Then my mind was made up, and  I said:    \"Yes, everything is ready; everything is shipshape, no detail is  wanting.  I know what to do now.\"    \"So do I; sit down and wait.\"    \"No, _sir_! rise up and _strike_!\"    \"Do you mean it?\"    \"Yes, indeed!  The _de_fensive isn't in my line, and the _of_fensive  is.  That is, when I hold a fair hand--two-thirds as good a hand  as the enemy.  Oh, yes, we'll rise up and strike; that's our game.\"    \"A hundred to one you are right.  When does the performance begin?\"    \"_Now!_  We'll proclaim the Republic.\"    \"Well, that _will_ precipitate things, sure enough!\"    \"It will make them buzz, I tell you!  England will be a hornets'  nest before noon to-morrow, if the Church's hand hasn't lost its  cunning--and we know it hasn't.  Now you write and I'll dictate thus:                          \"PROCLAMATION                               ---       \"BE IT KNOWN UNTO ALL.

The navigator, in  proceeding along the channels of the delta of the Orinoco at night,  sees with surprise the summit of the palm-trees illumined by large  fires. These are the habitations of the Guaraons (Tivitivas and  Waraweties of Raleigh* (* The Indian name of the tribe of Uaraus  (Guaraunos of the Spaniards) may be recognized in the Warawety  (Ouarauoty) of Raleigh, one of the branches of the Tivitivas. See  Discovery of Guiana, 1576 page 90 and the sketch of the habitations of  the Guaraons, in Raleghi brevis Descrip. Guianae, 1594 tab 4.)), which  are suspended from the trunks of trees. These tribes hang up mats in  the air, which they fill with earth, and kindle, on a layer of moist  clay, the fire necessary for their household wants. They have owed  their liberty and their political independence for ages to the quaking  and swampy soil, which they pass over in the time of drought, and on  which they alone know how to walk in security to their solitude in the  delta of the Orinoco; to their abode on the trees where religious  enthusiasm will probably never lead any American stylites.* (* This  sect was founded by Simeon Sisanites, a native of Syria. He passed  thirty-seven years in mystic contemplation, on five pillars, the last  of which was thirty-six cubits high. The sancti columnares attempted  to establish their aerial cloisters in the country of Treves, in  Germany; but the bishops opposed these extravagant and perilous  enterprises. Mosheim, Instit. Hist. Eccles page 192. See Humboldt's  Views of Nature (Bohn) pages 13 and 136.) I have already mentioned in  another place that the mauritia palm-tree, the tree of life of the  missionaries, not only affords the Guaraons a safe dwelling during the  risings of the Orinoco, but that its shelly fruit, its farinaceous  pith, its juice, abounding in saccharine matter, and the fibres of its  petioles, furnish them with food, wine,* and thread proper for making  cords and weaving hammocks. (* The use of this moriche wine however is  not very common. The Guaraons prefer in general a beverage of  fermented honey.) These customs of the Indians of the delta of the  Orinoco were found formerly in the Gulf of Darien (Uraba), and in the  greater part of the inundated lands between the Guarapiche and the  mouths of the Amazon. It is curious to observe in the lowest degree of  human civilization the existence of a whole tribe depending on one  single species of palm-tree, similar to those insects which feed on  one and the same flower, or on one and the same part of a plant.    The navigation of the river, whether vessels arrive by the Boca de  Navios, or risk entering the labyrinth of the bocas chicas, requires  various precautions, according as the waters are high or low. The  regularity of these periodical risings of the Orinoco has been long an  object of admiration to travellers, as the overflowings of the Nile  furnished the philosophers of antiquity with a problem difficult to  solve. The Orinoco and the Nile, contrary to the direction of the  Ganges, the Indus, the Rio de la Plata, and the Euphrates, flow alike  from the south toward the north; but the sources of the Orinoco are  five or six degrees nearer to the equator than those of the Nile.  Observing every day the accidental variations of the atmosphere, we  find it difficult to persuade ourselves that in a great space of time  the effects of these variations mutually compensate each other: that  in a long succession of years the averages of the temperature of the  humidity, and of the barometric pressure, differ so little from month  to month; and that nature, notwithstanding the multitude of partial  perturbations, follows a constant type in the series of meteorological  phenomena. Great rivers unite in one receptacle the waters which a  surface of several thousand square leagues receives. However unequal  may be the quantity of rain that falls during several successive  years, in such or such a valley, the swellings of rivers that have a  very long course are little affected by these local variations. The  swellings represent the average of the humidity that reigns in the  whole basin; they follow annually the same progression because their  commencement and their duration depend also on the mean of the  periods, apparently extremely variable, of the beginning and end of  the rains in the different latitudes through which the principal trunk  and its various tributary streams flow. Hence it follows that the  periodical oscillations of rivers are, like the equality of  temperature of caverns and springs, a sensible indication of the  regular distribution of humidity and heat, which takes place from year  to year on a considerable extent of land. They strike the imagination  of the vulgar; as order everywhere astonishes, when we cannot easily  ascend to first causes. Rivers that belong entirely to the torrid zone  display in their periodical movements that wonderful regularity which  is peculiar to a region where the same wind brings almost always  strata of air of the same temperature; and where the change of the sun  in its declination causes every year at the same period a rupture of  equilibrium in the electric intensity, in the cessation of the  breezes, and the commencement of the season of rains. The Orinoco, the  Rio Magdalena, and the Congo or Zaire are the only great rivers of the  equinoctial region of the globe, which, rising near the equator, have  their mouths in a much higher latitude, though still within the  tropics. The Nile and the Rio de la Plata direct their course, in the  two opposite hemispheres, from the torrid zone towards the temperate.*  (* In Asia, the Ganges, the Burrampooter, and the majestic rivers of  Indo-China direct their course towards the equator. The former flow  from the temperate to the torrid zone. This circumstance of courses  pursuing opposite directions (towards the equator, and towards the  temperate climates) has an influence on the period and the height of  the risings, on the nature and variety of the productions on the banks  of the rivers, on the less or greater activity of trade; and, I may  add, from what we know of the nations of Egypt, Merce, and India, on  the progress of civilization along the valleys of the rivers.)    As long as, confounding the Rio Paragua of Esmeralda with the Rio  Guaviare, the sources of the Orinoco were sought towards the  south-west, on the eastern back of the Andes, the risings of this  river were attributed to a periodical melting of the snows. This  reasoning was as far from the truth as that in which the Nile was  formerly supposed to be swelled by the waters of the snows of  Abyssinia. The Cordilleras of New Grenada, near which the western  tributary streams of the Orinoco, the Guaviare, the Meta, and the  Apure take their rise, enter no more into the limit of perpetual  snows, with the sole exception of the Paramos of Chita and Mucuchies,  than the Alps of Abyssinia. Snowy mountains are much more rare in the  torrid zone than is generally admitted; and the melting of the snows,  which is not copious there at any season, does not at all increase at  the time of the inundations of the Orinoco.    The cause of the periodical swellings of the Orinoco acts equally on  all the rivers that take rise in the torrid zone. After the vernal  equinox, the cessation of the breezes announces the season of rains.  The increase of the rivers (which may be considered as natural  pluviometers) is in proportion to the quantity of water that falls in  the different regions. This quantity, in the centre of the forests of  the Upper Orinoco and the Rio Negro, appeared to me to exceed 90 or  100 inches annually. Such of the natives, therefore, as have lived  beneath the misty sky of the Esmeralda and the Atabapo, know, without  the smallest notion of natural philosophy, what Eudoxus and  Eratosthenes knew heretofore,* that the inundations of the great  rivers are owing solely to the equatorial rains. (* Strabo lib. 17  page 789. Diod. Sic. lib. l c. 5.) The following is the usual progress  of the oscillations of the Orinoco. Immediately after the vernal  equinox (the people say on the 25th of March) the commencement of the  rising is perceived. It is at first only an inch in twenty-four hours;  sometimes the river again sinks in April; it attains its maximum in  July; remains at the same level from the end of July till the 25th of  August; and then decreases progressively, but more slowly than it  increased. It is at its minimum in January and February. In both  worlds the rivers of the northern torrid zone attain the greatest  height nearly at the same period. The Ganges, the Niger, and the  Gambia reach the maximum, like the Orinoco, in the month of August.*  (* Nearly forty or fifty days after the summer solstice.) The Nile is  two months later, either on account of some local circumstances in the  climate of Abyssinia, or of the length of its course, from the country  of Berber, or 17.5 degrees of latitude, to the bifurcation of the  delta. The Arabian geographers assert that in Sennaar and in Abyssinia  the Nile begins to swell in the month of April (nearly as the  Orinoco); the rise, however, does not become sensible at Cairo till  toward the summer solstice; and the water attains its greatest height  at the end of the month of September.* (* Nearly eighty or ninety days  after the summer solstice.) The river keeps at the same level till the  middle of October; and is at its minimum in April and May, a period  when the rivers of Guiana begin to swell anew. It may be seen from  this rapid statement, that, notwithstanding the retardation caused by  the form of the natural channels, and by local climatic circumstances,  the great phenomenon of the oscillations of the rivers of the torrid  zone is"]]]
