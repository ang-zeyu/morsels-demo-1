As the mist  vanishes upwards in light little clouds an open space on a mountain  height becomes visible in the dim light which precedes dawn. At one  side Wotan with Fricka beside him both asleep, lie on a flowery bank.  The dawning day illumines with increasing brightness a castle with  glittering pinnacles which stands on the summit of a cliff in the  background. Between this and the foreground a deep valley is visible  through which the Rhine flows._        FRICKA            [_Awakes; her gaze falls on the castle, which has          become plainly visible; alarmed._    WOTAN [_Continuing to dream._      The happy hall of delight    Is guarded by gate and door:        Manhood's honour,        Power for aye,    Rise to my lasting renown!    FRICKA [_Shakes him._          Up from deceitful        Bliss of a dream!    My husband, wake and consider!    WOTAN            [_Awakes and raises himself slightly. His glance is          immediately arrested by the view of the castle._      The walls everlasting are built!        On yonder summit        The Gods' abode        Proudly rears        Its radiant strength!    As I nursed it in dream    And desired it to be,        Strong it stands,        Fair to behold,    Brave and beautiful pile!    FRICKA          While thou rejoicest,        Joyless am I.        Thou hast thy hall;        My heart fears for Freia.    Heedless one, hast thou forgotten    The price that was to be paid?        The work is finished,        And forfeit the pledge:    Hast thou then no care for the cost?    WOTAN      My bargain well I remember    With them who built the abode.        'Twas a pact tamed them,        The obstinate race,        So that this hallowed        Hall they have built me.    It stands--the strong ones' doing:--    Fret not thou, counting the cost.    FRICKA      O laughing, insolent lightness!    Mirth how cruel and callous!    Had I but known of thy pact,    The trick had never been played;        But far from your counsels        Ye men kept the women,    That, deaf to us and in peace,    Alone ye might deal with the giants.        So without shame        Ye promised them Freia,    Freia, my beautiful sister,    Proud of playing the thief.        What remains holy        Or precious to men    Once grown greedy of might?    WOTAN [_Calmly._          From such greed        Was Fricka then free    Herself when the castle she craved?    FRICKA      I was forced to ponder some means    To keep my husband faithful,    True to me when his fancy    Tempted him far from his home.        Halls high and stately,        Decked to delight thee,        Were to constrain thee        To peaceful repose.    But thou hadst the work designed    Intent on war alone;        It was to add        More to thy might still,        To stir up to tumult still fiercer    That built were the towering walls    WOTAN          Wouldst thou, O Wife!        In the castle confine me,    To me, the god, must be granted,        Faithful at home,        The right to wage war    And conquer the world from without.        Ranging and changing        All men love:    That sport at least thou must leave me.    FRICKA          Cold, hard-hearted,        Merciless man!        For the idle baubles,        Empire and sway,    Thou stakest in insolent scorn    Love and a woman's worth!    WOTAN      When I went wooing, to win thee        I staked ungrudging,    Gladly one of my eyes:    What folly now then to scold!        Women I honour        Beyond thy desire!        I will not abandon        Frei, the fair:    Such never was my intent.    FRICKA            [_ Anxiously looking towards a point not on the          stage._          Then succour her now:        Defenceless, in fear,    Hither she hastens for help!    FREIA            [_Enters as if flying from someone._           Help me, sister!         Shield me, o brother!         From yonder mountain         Menaces Fasolt:     He comes to bear me off captive.    WOTAN          Let him come!        Sawest thou Loge?    FRICKA          To this tricky deceiver        O why wilt thou trust?    He always snares thee anew,    Though from his snares thou hast suffered.    WOTAN      I ask for no aid    Where simple truth suffices;        But to turn the spite        Of foes to profit,    Craft and cunning alone    Can teach, as by Loge employed.    He whose advice I obeyed    Has promised ransom for Freia:    On him my faith I have fixed.    FRICKA      And art left in the lurch.        The giants come.        Lo! hither they stride:    Where lingers now thine ally?    FREIA          Where tarry ye, my brothers,        When help ye should bring me,    Weak and bartered away by my kin?        O help me, Donner!        Hither! Hither!    Rescue Freia, my Froh!    FRICKA      Now the knaves who plotted and tricked thee    Abandon thee in thy need.            [_Fasolt and Fafner, both of gigantic stature,          enter, armed with stout clubs._    FASOLT          Soft sleep        Sealed thine eyes        While we, both sleepless,    Built the castle walls:        Working hard        Wearied not,        Heaping, heaving        Heavy stones.        Tower steep,        Door and gate        Keep and guard    Thy goodly castle halls.            [_Pointing to the castle._          There stands        What we builded,        Shining fair        Beneath the sun.        Enter in    And pay the price!    WOTAN      Name, Workers, your wage.    What payment will appease you?    FASOLT      We made the terms    That seemed to us meet.    Hast thou forgot so soon?        Freia, the fair one,        Holda, the free one--        The bargain is    We bear her away.    WOTAN (Quickly.)          Ye must be mad        To moot such a thing!    Ask some other wage;    Freia I will not grant.    FASOLT            _Stands for a space speechless with angry surprise._          What is this? Ha!        Wouldest deceive?--        Go back on thy bond?        What thy spear wards        Are they but sport,    All the runes of solemn bargain?    FAFNER          O trusty brother!    Fool, dost now see the trick?    FASOLT          Son of light,        Light, unstable,    Hearken! Have a care!    In treaties keep thou troth!        What thou art        Thou art only by treaties,        For, built on bonds,    There are bounds to thy might.        Though cunning thou,        More clever than we:        Though we once freemen,        Are pledged to peace,    Cursed be all thy wisdom;--        Peaceful promises perish!--        Wilt thou not open,    Honest and frank    Stand fast by a bargain once fixed.        A stupid giant        Tells thee this:    O wise one, take it from him!    [Illustration: plate 06, Freia, the fair one]    WOTAN      How sly to judge us serious    When plainly we were but jesting!        The beautiful Goddess        Light and bright--    For churls what charm could she have?    FASOLT          Jeerest thou?        Ha! how unjust!    Ye who by beauty rule,    Proud and radiant race!        How foolish, striving        For towers of stone,    Woman's love to pledge--    Price of walls and of halls!    We dolts, despising ease,    Sweating with toil-hardened hands,        Have worked, that a woman        With gentle delight    In our midst might sojourn    And ye call the pact a jest?    FAFNER      Cease thy childish chatter;    No gain look we to get.        Freia's charms        Mean little;    But it means much,    If from the Gods we remove her.        Golden apples    Ripen within her garden;        She alone    Grows the apples and tends them.        The goodly fruit        Gives to her kinsfolk,        Who eat thereof,        Youth everlasting.        Sick and pale,        Their beauty would perish,        Old and weak,        Wasting away,    Were not Freia among them.            [_Roughly._      From their midst, therefore, Freia must forth!    WOTAN [_Aside._          Loge lingers long!    FASOLT          We wait for thy word!    WOTAN          Ask some other wage!    FASOLT          No other: Freia alone!    FAFNER          Thou there, follow us!            [_Fafner and Fasolt press towards Freia. Froh"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/485"],[0,"The Road to Oz (#3)"],[1,"rmation.  The boy was evidently lost, and his people would be sure  to worry about him.  He seemed two or three years younger than Dorothy,  and was prettily dressed, as if someone loved him dearly and took much  pains to make him look well.  How, then, did he come to be in this  lonely road? she wondered.    Near Button-Bright, on the ground, lay a sailor hat with a gilt anchor  on the band.  His sailor trousers were long and wide at the bottom, and  the broad collar of his blouse had gold anchors sewed on its corners.  The boy was still digging at his hole.    \"Have you ever been to sea?\" asked Dorothy.    \"To see what?\" answered Button-Bright.    \"I mean, have you ever been where there's water?\"    \"Yes,\" said Button-Bright; \"there's a well in our back yard.\"    \"You don't understand,\" cried Dorothy.  \"I mean, have you ever been on  a big ship floating on a big ocean?\"    \"Don't know,\" said he.    \"Then why do you wear sailor clothes?\"    \"Don't know,\" he answered, again.    Dorothy was in despair.    \"You're just AWFUL stupid, Button-Bright,\" she said.    \"Am I?\" he asked.    \"Yes, you are.\"    \"Why?\" looking up at her with big eyes.    She was going to say: \"Don't know,\" but stopped herself in time.    \"That's for you to answer,\" she replied.    \"It's no use asking Button-Bright questions,\" said the shaggy man, who  had been eating another apple; \"but someone ought to take care of the  poor little chap, don't you think?  So he'd better come along with us.\"    Toto had been looking with great curiosity in the hole which the boy  was digging, and growing more and more excited every minute, perhaps  thinking that Button-Bright was after some wild animal.  The little dog  began barking loudly and jumped into the hole himself, where he began  to dig with his tiny paws, making the earth fly in all directions.  It  spattered over the boy.  Dorothy seized him and raised him to his feet,  brushing his clothes with her hand.    \"Stop that, Toto!\"  she called. \"There aren't any mice or woodchucks in  that hole, so don't be foolish.\"    Toto stopped, sniffed at the hole suspiciously, and jumped out of it,  wagging his tail as if he had done something important.    \"Well,\" said the shaggy man, \"let's start on, or we won't get anywhere  before night comes.\"    \"Where do you expect to get to?\" asked Dorothy.    \"I'm like Button-Bright.  I don't know,\" answered the shaggy man, with  a laugh.  \"But I've learned from long experience that every road leads  somewhere, or there wouldn't be any road; so it's likely that if we  travel long enough, my dear, we will come to some place or another in  the end.  What place it will be we can't even guess at this moment, but  we're sure to find out when we get there.\"    \"Why, yes,\" said Dorothy; \"that seems reas'n'ble, Shaggy Man.\"          3.  A Queer Village      Button-Bright took the shaggy man's hand willingly; for the shaggy man  had the Love Magnet, you know, which was the reason Button-Bright had  loved him at once.  They started on, with Dorothy on one side, and Toto  on the other, the little party trudging along more cheerfully than you  might have supposed.  The girl was getting used to queer adventures,  which interested her very much.  Wherever Dorothy went Toto was sure to  go, like Mary's little lamb.  Button-Bright didn't seem a bit afraid or  worried because he was lost, and the shaggy man had no home, perhaps,  and was as happy in one place as in another.    Before long they saw ahead of them a fine big arch spanning the road,  and when they came nearer they found that the arch was beautifully  carved and decorated with rich colors.  A row of peacocks with spread  tails ran along the top of it, and all the feathers were gorgeously  painted.  In the center was a large fox's head, and the fox wore a  shrewd and knowing expression and had large spectacles over its eyes  and a small golden crown with shiny points on top of its head.    While the travelers were looking with curiosity at this beautiful arch  there suddenly marched out of it a company of soldiers--only the  soldiers were all foxes dressed in uniforms.  They wore green jackets  and yellow pantaloons, and their little round caps and their high boots  were a bright red color.  Also, there was a big red bow tied about the  middle of each long, bushy tail.  Each soldier was armed with a wooden  sword having an edge of sharp teeth set in a row, and the sight of  these teeth at first caused Dorothy to shudder.    A captain marched in front of the company of fox-soldiers, his uniform  embroidered with gold braid to make it handsomer than the others.    Almost before our friends realized it the soldiers had surrounded them  on all sides, and the captain was calling out in a harsh voice:    \"Surrender!  You are our prisoners.\"    \"What's a pris'ner?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"A prisoner is a captive,\" replied the fox-captain, strutting up and  down with much dignity.    \"What's a captive?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"You're one,\" said the captain.    That made the shaggy man laugh    \"Good afternoon, captain,\" he said, bowing politely to all the foxes  and very low to their commander.  \"I trust you are in good health, and  that your families are all well?\"    The fox-captain looked at the shaggy man, and his sharp features grew  pleasant and smiling.    \"We're pretty well, thank you, Shaggy Man,\" said he; and Dorothy knew  that the Love Magnet was working and that all the foxes now loved the  shaggy man because of it.  But Toto didn't know this, for he began  barking angrily and tried to bite the captain's hairy leg where it  showed between his red boots and his yellow pantaloons.    \"Stop, Toto!\" cried the little girl, seizing the dog in her arms.  \"These are our friends.\"    \"Why, so we are!\" remarked the captain in tones of astonishment.  \"I  thought at first we were enemies, but it seems you are friends instead.  You must come with me to see King Dox.\"    \"Who's he?\" asked Button-Bright, with earnest eyes.    \"King Dox of Foxville; the great and wise sovereign who rules over our  community.\"    \"What's sov'rin, and what's c'u'nity?\" inquired Button-Bright.    \"Don't ask so many questions, little boy.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Ah, why indeed?\" exclaimed the captain, looking at Button-Bright  admiringly.  \"If you don't ask questions you will learn nothing.  True  enough.  I was wrong.  You're a very clever little boy, come to think  of it--very clever indeed.  But now, friends, please come with me, for  it is my duty to escort you at once to the royal palace.\"    The soldiers marched back through the arch again, and with them marched  the shaggy man, Dorothy, Toto, and Button-Bright.  Once through the  opening they found a fine, big city spread out before them, all the  houses of carved marble in beautiful colors.  The decorations were  mostly birds and other fowl, such as peacocks, pheasants, turkeys,  prairie-chickens, ducks, and geese.  Over each doorway was carved a  head representing the fox who lived in that house, this effect being  quite pretty and unusual.    As our friends marched along, some of the foxes came out on the porches  and balconies to get a view of the strangers.  These foxes were all  handsomely dressed, the girl-foxes and women-foxes wearing gowns of  feathers woven together effectively and colored in bright hues which  Dorothy thought were quite artistic and decidedly attractive.    Button-Bright stared until his eyes were big and round, and he would  have stumbled and fallen more than once had not the shaggy man grasped  his hand tightly.  They were all interested, and Toto was so excited he  wanted to bark every minute and to chase and fight every fox he caught  sight of; but Dorothy held his little wiggling body fast in her arms  and commanded him to be good and behave himself.  So he finally quieted  down, like a wise doggy, deciding there were too many foxes in Foxville  to fight at one time.    By-and-by they came to a big square, and in the center of the square  stood the royal palace.  Dorothy knew it at once because it had over  its great door the carved head of a fox just like the one she had seen  on the arch, and this fox was the only one who wore a golden crown.    There were many fox-soldiers guarding the door, but they bowed to the  captain and admitted him without question.  The captain led them  through many rooms, where richly dressed foxes were sitting on  beautiful chairs or sipping tea, which was being passed around by  fox-servants in white aprons.  They came to a big doorway covered with  heavy curtains of cloth of gold.    Beside this doorway stood a huge drum.  The fox-captain went to this  drum and knocked his knees against it--first one knee and then the  other--so that the drum said: \"Boom-boom.\"    \"You must all do exactly what I do,\" ordered the captain; so the shaggy  man pounded the drum with his knees, and so did Dorothy and so did  Button-Bright.  The boy wanted to keep on pounding it with his little  fat knees, because he liked the sound of it; but the captain stopped  him.  Toto couldn't pound the drum with his knees and he didn't know  enough to wag his tail against it, so Dorothy pounded the drum for him  and that made him bark, and when the little dog barked the fox-captain  scowled.    The golden curtains drew back far enough to make an opening, through  which marched the captain with the others.    The broad, long room they entered was decorated in gold with  stained-glass windows of splendid colors.  In the corner of the room  upon a richly carved golden throne, sat the fox-king, surrounded by a  group of other foxes, all of whom wore great spectacles over their  eyes, making them look solemn and important.    Dorothy knew the King at once, because she had seen his head carved on  the arch and over the doorway of the palace.  Having met with several  other kings in her travels, she knew what to do, and at once made a low  bow before the throne.  The shaggy man"]]]
