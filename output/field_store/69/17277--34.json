If exalted into a higher  station, mankind and posterity reap the fruit of his labours.    As these topics of praise never fail to be employed, and with success,  where we would inspire esteem for any one; may it not thence be  concluded, that the utility, resulting from the social virtues, forms,  at least, a PART of their merit, and is one source of that approbation  and regard so universally paid to them?    When we recommend even an animal or a plant as USEFUL and BENEFICIAL, we  give it an applause and recommendation suited to its nature. As, on the  other hand, reflection on the baneful influence of any of these inferior  beings always inspires us with the sentiment of aversion. The eye is  pleased with the prospect of corn-fields and loaded vine-yards;  horses grazing, and flocks pasturing: but flies the view of briars and  brambles, affording shelter to wolves and serpents.    A machine, a piece of furniture, a vestment, a house well contrived  for use and conveniency, is so far beautiful, and is contemplated with  pleasure and approbation. An experienced eye is here sensible to many  excellencies, which escape persons ignorant and uninstructed.    Can anything stronger be said in praise of a profession, such as  merchandize or manufacture, than to observe the advantages which it  procures to society; and is not a monk and inquisitor enraged when we  treat his order as useless or pernicious to mankind?    The historian exults in displaying the benefit arising from his labours.  The writer of romance alleviates or denies the bad consequences ascribed  to his manner of composition.    In general, what praise is implied in the simple epithet USEFUL! What  reproach in the contrary!    Your Gods, says Cicero [De Nat. Deor. lib. i.], in opposition to the  Epicureans, cannot justly claim any worship or adoration, with whatever  imaginary perfections you may suppose them endowed. They are totally  useless and inactive. Even the Egyptians, whom you so much ridicule,  never consecrated any animal but on account of its utility.    The sceptics assert [Sext. Emp. adrersus Math. lib. viii.], though  absurdly, that the origin of all religious worship was derived from the  utility of inanimate objects, as the sun and moon, to the support  and well-being of mankind. This is also the common reason assigned by  historians, for the deification of eminent heroes and legislators [Diod.  Sic. passim.].    To plant a tree, to cultivate a field, to beget children; meritorious  acts, according to the religion of Zoroaster.    In all determinations of morality, this circumstance of public utility  is ever principally in view; and wherever disputes arise, either in  philosophy or common life, concerning the bounds of duty, the question  cannot, by any means, be decided with greater certainty, than by  ascertaining, on any side, the true interests of mankind. If any false  opinion, embraced from appearances, has been found to prevail; as soon  as farther experience and sounder reasoning have given us juster notions  of human affairs, we retract our first sentiment, and adjust anew the  boundaries of moral good and evil.    Giving alms to common beggars is naturally praised; because it seems  to carry relief to the distressed and indigent: but when we observe the  encouragement thence arising to idleness and debauchery, we regard that  species of charity rather as a weakness than a virtue.    Tyrannicide, or the assassination of usurpers and oppressive princes,  was highly extolled in ancient times; because it both freed mankind from  many of these monsters, and seemed to keep the others in awe, whom the  sword or poniard could not reach. But history and experience having  since convinced us, that this practice increases the jealousy and  cruelty of princes, a Timoleon and a Brutus, though treated with  indulgence on account of the prejudices of their times, are now  considered as very improper models for imitation.    Liberality in princes is regarded as a mark of beneficence, but when  it occurs, that the homely bread of the honest and industrious is often  thereby converted into delicious cates for the idle and the prodigal, we  soon retract our heedless praises. The regrets of a prince, for having  lost a day, were noble and generous: but had he intended to have spent  it in acts of generosity to his greedy courtiers, it was better lost  than misemployed after that manner.    Luxury, or a refinement on the pleasures and conveniences of life, had  not long been supposed the source of every corruption in government, and  the immediate cause of faction, sedition, civil wars, and the total loss  of liberty. It was, therefore, universally regarded as a vice, and was  an object of declamation to all satirists, and severe moralists. Those,  who prove, or attempt to prove, that such refinements rather tend to the  increase of industry, civility, and arts regulate anew our MORAL as well  as POLITICAL sentiments, and represent, as laudable or innocent, what  had formerly been regarded as pernicious and blameable.    Upon the whole, then, it seems undeniable, THAT nothing can bestow more  merit on any human creature than the sentiment of benevolence in an  eminent degree; and THAT a PART, at least, of its merit arises from its  tendency to promote the interests of our species, and bestow happiness  on human society. We carry our view into the salutary consequences  of such a character and disposition; and whatever has so benign an  influence, and forwards so desirable an end, is beheld with complacency  and pleasure. The social virtues are never regarded without their  beneficial tendencies, nor viewed as barren and unfruitful. The  happiness of mankind, the order of society, the harmony of families, the  mutual support of friends, are always considered as the result of their  gentle dominion over the breasts of men.    How considerable a PART of their merit we ought to ascribe to their  utility, will better appear from future disquisitions; [Footnote: Sect.  III. and IV.] as well as the reason, why this circumstance has such a  command over our esteem and approbation. [Footnote: Sect. V.]          SECTION III. OF JUSTICE.        PART I.        THAT Justice is useful to society, and consequently that PART of its  merit, at least, must arise from that consideration, it would be a  superfluous undertaking to prove. That public utility is the SOLE origin  of justice, and that reflections on the beneficial consequences of this  virtue are the SOLE foundation of its merit; this proposition, being  more curious and important, will better deserve our examination and  enquiry.    Let us suppose that nature has bestowed on the human race such profuse  ABUNDANCE of all EXTERNAL conveniencies, that, without any uncertainty  in the event, without any care or industry on our part, every individual  finds himself fully provided with whatever his most voracious appetites  can want, or luxurious imagination wish or desire. His natural beauty,  we shall suppose, surpasses all acquired ornaments: the perpetual  clemency of the seasons renders useless all clothes or covering: the  raw herbage affords him the most delicious fare; the clear fountain,  the richest beverage. No laborious occupation required: no tillage: no  navigation. Music, poetry, and contemplation form his sole business:  conversation, mirth, and friendship his sole amusement. It seems evident  that, in such a happy state, every other social virtue would flourish,  and receive tenfold increase; but the cautious, jealous virtue of  justice would never once have been dreamed of. For what purpose make a  partition of goods, where every one has already more than enough? Why  give rise to property, where there cannot possibly be any injury? Why  call this object MINE, when upon the seizing of it by another, I need  but stretch out my hand to possess myself to what is equally valuable?  Justice, in that case, being totally useless, would be an idle  ceremonial, and could never possibly have place in the catalogue of  virtues.    We see, even in the present necessitous condition of mankind, that,  wherever any benefit is bestowed by nature in an unlimited abundance,  we leave it always in common among the whole human race, and make no  subdivisions of right and property. Water and air, though the most  necessary of all objects, are not challenged as the property of  individuals; nor can any man commit injustice by the most lavish use and  enjoyment of these blessings. In fertile extensive countries, with few  inhabitants, land is regarded on the same footing. And no topic is so  much insisted on by those, who defend the liberty of the seas, as the  unexhausted use of them in navigation. Were the advantages, procured  by navigation, as inexhaustible, these reasoners had never had any  adversaries to refute; nor had any claims ever been advanced of a  separate, exclusive dominion over the ocean.    It may happen, in some countries, at some periods, that there be  established a property in water, none in land [Footnote: Genesis, chaps.  xiii. and xxi.]; if the latter be in greater abundance than can be used  by the inhabitants, and the former be found, with difficulty, and in  very small quantities.    Again; suppose, that, though the necessities of human race continue the  same as at present, yet the mind is so enlarged, and so replete with  friendship and generosity, that every man has the utmost tenderness for  every man, and feels no more concern for his own interest than for that  of his fellows; it seems evident, that the use of justice would, in  this case, be suspended by such an extensive benevolence, nor would the  divisions and barriers of property and obligation have ever been thought  of.

The characteristic  avidity with which the American people seize upon a novelty has been  wonderfully exemplified by the manner in which the telephone mania has  spread. In consequence of this science has received an impetus, and now  we have everywhere embryo electricians and experimentalists, where  before were only the unscientific.           *       *       *       *       *                              =LETTER FROM PROFESSOR HUGHES.=    We print in another column a letter received from Mr. D. E. Hughes  concerning the distinction he finds between his microphone and Mr.  Edison's carbon telephone. Mr. Hughes is very confident that the two  inventions have nothing in common, and that they bear no resemblance to  each other in form, material, or principles.    We would not question Mr. Hughes' sincerity in all this. No doubt he  honestly believes that the invention of Mr. Edison \"represents no field  of discovery, and is restricted in its uses to telephony,\" whilst the  \"microphone demonstrates and represents the whole field of nature.\" But  the fact of his believing this is only another proof that he utterly  fails to understand or appreciate the real scope and character of Mr.  Edison's work.    To those familiar not only with Mr. Edison's telephone but with the long  line of experimental investigation that had to be gone through with  before he was able to control the excessive sensitiveness of the  elements of his original discovery, it is very clear that Mr. Hughes has  been working upon and over-estimating the importance of one phase, and  that a limited phase, of Mr. Edison's investigations.    We propose shortly to review at length the evidence of Mr. Edison's  priority in the invention or discovery of all that the microphone  covers; this purely as a question of scientific interest. For the  personal elements of the controversy between Mr. Edison on the one side  and Messrs. Preece and Hughes on the other we care nothing.           *       *       *       *       *                         =THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN EXPORT EDITION.=    The inquiry for American manufactured products and machinery abroad  seems to grow in volume and variety daily. And though, in comparison  with our capacity to produce, the foreign demand is yet small, its  possibilities are unlimited. To increase the demand the immediate  problem is to make known throughout the world in the most attractive  fashion possible the wide range of articles which America is prepared to  furnish, and which other nations have use for. As a medium for conveying  such intelligence the monthly export edition of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN  is unequaled. The table of contents of the second issue, to be found in  another column, will give an idea of the wide range and permanent as  well as timely interest of the matter it circulates. It is a magazine of  valuable information that will be preserved and repeatedly read. The  handsomely illustrated advertising pages supplement the text, and make  it at once the freshest, fullest, and most attractive periodical of the  sort in the world. An examination of the index of advertisers will show  how widely its advantages for reaching foreign buyers have been  appreciated by leading American houses. In the advertising page XXV.  appears a list of some eight hundred foreign commercial places in which  the circulation of the paper is guaranteed, as evidence that it reaches  those for whom such publications are intended.           *       *       *       *       *                                      =FOUNTAIN PENS.=    For several days we have had in use in our office examples of the  Mackinnon Fountain Pen, and find it to be a very serviceable and  effective instrument. This is a handsome looking pen, with a hollow  handle, in which a supply of ink is carried, and the fluid flows from  the point in the act of writing. The necessity of an inkstand is thus  avoided. One of the difficulties heretofore with pens of this character  has been to insure a free and certain delivery of the ink, and also to  bring the instrument within the compass and weight of an ordinary pen.  The inventor seems to have admirably succeeded in the example before us.  The ink flows with certainty, and there is no scratching as with the  ordinary pen; it writes with facility on either smooth or rough paper;  writes even more smoothly than a lead pencil; may be carried in the  pocket; is always ready for use; there is no spilling or blotting of  ink. The construction is simple, durable, and the action effective. One  filling lasts a week or more, according to the extent of use. These are  some of the qualities that our use of the pen so far has seemed to  demonstrate; and which made us think that whoever supplies himself with  a Mackinnon Pen will possess a good thing.

LANGLEY, ALLEGHENY OBSERVATORY, PA.*    When, with a powerful telescope, we return to the study of the sun's  surface, we meet a formidable difficulty which our first simple means  did not present. This arises from the nearly constant tremors of our own  atmosphere, through which we have to look. It is not that the tremor  does not exist with the smaller instrument, but now our higher  magnifying power exaggerates it, causes everything to appear unsteady  and blurry, however good the glass, and makes the same kind of trouble  for the eye which we should experience if we tried to read very fine  print across the top of a hot stove, whence columns of tremulous air  were rising. There is no remedy for this, unless it is assiduous  watching and infinite patience, for in almost every day there will come  one or more brief intervals, lasting sometimes minutes, sometimes only  seconds, during which the air seems momentarily tranquil. We must be on  the watch for hours, to seize these favorable moments, and, piecing  together what we have seen in them, in the course of time we obtain such  knowledge of the more curious features of the solar surface as we now  possess.    The eye aches after gazing for a minute steadily at the full moon, and  the sun's light is from 300,000 to 600,000 times brighter than full moon  light, while its heat is in still greater proportion. The object lens of  such a telescope as the equatorial at Allegheny is 13 inches in  diameter, and it is such light, and such heat, concentrated by it, that  we have to gaze on. The best contrivance so far found for diminishing  both, and without which our present acquaintance with the real  appearance and character of sunspots would not have been gained, depends  upon a curious property of light, discovered by a French physicist,  Malus, in the beginning of this century. Let A (Fig. 10) be a piece of  plane unsilvered glass, receiving the solar rays and reflecting them to  a second similar one, B, which itself reflects them again in the  direction C. Of course, since the glass is transparent, most of the rays  will pass through A, and not be reflected. Of those which reach B again  most will pass through, so that not a hundredth part of the original  beam reaches C. This then, is so far a gain; but of itself of little  use, since, such is the solar brilliancy, that even this small fraction  would, to an eye at C, appear blindingly bright. Now, if we rotate B  about the line joining it with A, keeping always the same reflecting  angle with it, it might naturally be supposed that the light would  merely be reflected in a new direction unchanged in quantity.    But according to the curious discovery of Malus this is not what  happens. What does happen is that the second glass, after being given a  quarter turn (though always kept at the same angle), seems to lose its  power of reflection almost altogether. The light which comes from it now  is diminished enormously, and yet nothing is distorted or displaced;  everything is seen correctly if enough light remains to see it by at  all, and the ray is said to have been \"polarized by reflection.\" It  would be out of place to enter here on the cause of the phenomenon; the  fact is certain, and is a very precious one, for the astronomer can now  diminish the sun's light till it is bearable by the weakest eye, without  any distortion of what he is looking at, and without disturbing the  natural tints by colored glasses. In practice, a third and sometimes a  fourth reflector, each of a wedge shaped, optically plane piece of  unsilvered glass, are thus introduced, and by a simple rotation of the  last one the light is graded at pleasure, so that with such an  instrument, called \"the polarizing eyepiece\" (Fig. A), I have often  watched the sun's magnified image for four or five hours together with  no more distress to the eye than in reading a newspaper.    With this, in favorable moments, we see that the sun's surface away from  the spots, everywhere, is made up of hundreds of thousands of small,  intensely brilliant bodies, that seem to be floating in a gray medium,  which, though itself no doubt very bright, appears dark by comparison.  What these little things are is still uncertain; whatever they are, they  are the immediate principal source of the sun's light and heat. To get  an idea of their size we must resort to some more delicate means of  measurement than we used in the case of the watch. The filar micrometer  consists essentially of two excessively fine strands of cobwebs (or,  rather, of spider's cocoon), called technically \"wires,\" stretched  parallel to each other and placed just at the focus of the telescope.  Suppose one of them to be fixed and the second to be movable (keeping  always parallel to the first) by means of a screw, having perhaps one  hundred threads to the inch,"]]]
