The events which make up the first volume of the History of the Church  moved forward from the back ground of successive dispensations of the  Gospel which preceded the Dispensation of the Fullness of Times. That  volume covered the period from the birth of the Prophet Joseph Smith,  1805, to the close of the year 1833, and included as its chief events:  the birth of the Prophet; his first vision of the father and the  Son; the coming forth of the Book of Mormon; the organization of the  Church, April 6th, 1830; the mission to the Lamanites; the gathering  of the people "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4723"],[0,"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (#3)"],[1,"there  are general ideas, but only that there are any ABSTRACT GENERAL  IDEAS; for, in the passages we have quoted wherein there is  mention of general ideas, it is always supposed that they are formed by  ABSTRACTION, after the manner set forth in sections 8 and 9. Now, if we  will annex a meaning to our words, and speak only of what we can  conceive, I believe we shall acknowledge that an idea which, considered  in itself, is particular, becomes general by being made to represent or  stand for all other particular ideas of the SAME SORT. To make this plain  by an example, suppose a geometrician is demonstrating the method of  cutting a line in two equal parts. He draws, for instance, a black line  of an inch in length: this, which in itself is a particular line, is  nevertheless with regard to its signification general, since, as it is  there used, it represents all particular lines whatsoever; so that what  is demonstrated of it is demonstrated of all lines, or, in other words,  of a line in general. And, as that particular line becomes general by  being made a sign, so the name LINE, which taken absolutely is  PARTICULAR, by being a sign is made GENERAL. And as the former owes its  generality not to its being the sign of an abstract or general line, but  of ALL PARTICULAR right lines that may possibly exist, so the latter must  be thought to derive its generality from the same cause, namely, the  VARIOUS PARTICULAR lines which it indifferently denotes. [Note.]    [Note: \"I look upon this (doctrine) to be one of the greatest and most  valuable discoveries that have been made of late years in the republic  of letters.\"--Treatise of Human Nature, book i, part i, sect. 7. Also  Stewart's Philosophy of the Mind, part i, chapt. iv. sect. iii. p. 99.]    13. ABSTRACT GENERAL IDEAS NECESSARY, ACCORDING TO LOCKE.--To give  the reader a yet clearer view of the nature of abstract ideas,  and the uses they are thought necessary to, I shall add one more  passage out of the Essay on Human Understanding, (IV. vii. 9) which is as  follows: \"ABSTRACT IDEAS are not so obvious or easy to children or the  yet unexercised mind as particular ones. If they seem so to grown men it  is only because by constant and familiar use they are made so. For, when  we nicely reflect upon them, we shall find that general ideas are  fictions and contrivances of the mind, that carry difficulty with them,  and do not so easily offer themselves as we are apt to imagine. For  example, does it not require some pains and skill to form the general  idea of a triangle (which is yet none of the most abstract,  comprehensive, and difficult); for it must be neither oblique nor  rectangle, neither equilateral, equicrural, nor scalenon, but ALL AND  NONE of these at once? In effect, it is something imperfect that cannot  exist, an idea wherein some parts of several different and INCONSISTENT  ideas are put together. It is true the mind in this imperfect state has  need of such ideas, and makes all the haste to them it can, for the  CONVENIENCY OF COMMUNICATION AND ENLARGEMENT OF KNOWLEDGE, to both which  it is naturally very much inclined. But yet one has reason to suspect  such ideas are marks of our imperfection. At least this is enough to show  that the most abstract and general ideas are not those that the mind is  first and most easily acquainted with, nor such as its earliest knowledge  is conversant about.\"--If any man has the faculty of framing in his mind  such an idea of a triangle as is here described, it is in vain to pretend  to dispute him out of it, nor would I go about it. All I desire is that  the reader would fully and certainly inform himself whether he has such  an idea or no. And this, methinks, can be no hard task for anyone to  perform. What more easy than for anyone to look a little into his own  thoughts, and there try whether he has, or can attain to have, an idea  that shall correspond with the description that is here given of the  general idea of a triangle, which is NEITHER OBLIQUE NOR RECTANGLE,  EQUILATERAL, EQUICRURAL NOR SCALENON, BUT ALL AND NONE OF THESE AT ONCE?    14. BUT THEY ARE NOT NECESSARY FOR COMMUNICATION.--Much is here  said of the difficulty that abstract ideas carry with them, and  the pains and skill requisite to the forming them. And it is on  all hands agreed that there is need of great toil and labour of the mind,  to emancipate our thoughts from particular objects, and raise them to  those sublime speculations that are conversant about abstract ideas. From  all which the natural consequence should seem to be, that so DIFFICULT a  thing as the forming abstract ideas was not necessary for COMMUNICATION,  which is so EASY and familiar to ALL SORTS OF MEN. But, we are told, if  they seem obvious and easy to grown men, IT IS ONLY BECAUSE BY CONSTANT  AND FAMILIAR USE THEY ARE MADE SO. Now, I would fain know at what time it  is men are employed in surmounting that difficulty, and furnishing  themselves with those necessary helps for discourse. It cannot be when  they are grown up, for then it seems they are not conscious of any such  painstaking; it remains therefore to be the business of their childhood.  And surely the great and multiplied labour of framing abstract notions  will be found a hard task for that tender age. Is it not a hard thing to  imagine that a couple of children cannot prate together of their  sugar-plums and rattles and the rest of their little trinkets, till they  have first tacked together numberless inconsistencies, and so framed in  their minds ABSTRACT GENERAL IDEAS, and annexed them to every common name  they make use of?    15. NOR FOR THE ENLARGEMENT OF KNOWLEDGE.--Nor do I think them  a whit more needful for the ENLARGEMENT OF KNOWLEDGE than for  COMMUNICATION. It is, I know, a point much insisted on, that  all knowledge and demonstration are about universal notions, to  which I fully agree: but then it doth not appear to me that those notions  are formed by ABSTRACTION in the manner PREMISED--UNIVERSALITY, so far as  I can comprehend, not consisting in the absolute, POSITIVE nature or  conception of anything, but in the RELATION it bears to the particulars  signified or represented by it; by virtue whereof it is that things,  names, or notions, being in their own nature PARTICULAR, are rendered  UNIVERSAL. Thus, when I demonstrate any proposition concerning triangles,  it is to be supposed that I have in view the universal idea of a  triangle; which ought not to be understood as if I could frame an idea of  a triangle which was neither equilateral, nor scalenon, nor equicrural;  but only that the particular triangle I consider, whether of this or that  sort it matters not, doth equally stand for and represent all rectilinear  triangles whatsoever, and is in that sense UNIVERSAL. All which seems  very plain and not to include any difficulty in it.    16. OBJECTION.--ANSWER.--But here it will be demanded, HOW WE CAN KNOW ANY  PROPOSITION TO BE TRUE OF ALL PARTICULAR TRIANGLES, EXCEPT we have first  seen it DEMONSTRATED OF THE ABSTRACT IDEA OF A TRIANGLE which equally  agrees to all? For, because a property may be demonstrated to agree to  some one particular triangle, it will not thence follow that it equally  belongs to any other triangle, which in all respects is not the same with  it. For example, having demonstrated that the three angles of an isosceles  rectangular triangle are equal to two right ones, I cannot therefore  conclude this affection agrees to all other triangles which have neither  a right angle nor two equal sides. It seems therefore that, to be certain  this proposition is universally true, we must either make a particular  demonstration for every particular triangle, which is impossible, or once  for all demonstrate it of the ABSTRACT IDEA OF A TRIANGLE, in which all  the particulars do indifferently partake and by which they are all  equally represented. To which I answer, that, though the idea I have in  view whilst I make the demonstration be, for instance, that of an  isosceles rectangular triangle whose sides are of a determinate length, I  may nevertheless be certain it extends to all other rectilinear  triangles, of what sort or bigness soever. And that because neither the  right angle, nor the equality, nor determinate length of the sides are at  all concerned in the demonstration. It is true the diagram I have in view  includes all these particulars, but then there is not the least mention  made of them in the proof of the proposition. It is not said the three  angles are equal to two right ones, because one of them is a right angle,  or because the sides comprehending it are of the same length. Which  sufficiently shows that the right angle might have been oblique, and the  sides unequal, and for all that the demonstration have held good. And for  this reason it is that I conclude that to be true of any obliquangular or  scalenon which I had demonstrated of a particular right--angled  equicrural triangle, and not because I demonstrated the proposition of  the abstract idea of a triangle And here it must be acknowledged that a  man may consider a figure merely as triangular, without attending to the  particular qualities of the angles, or relations of the sides. So far he  may abstract; but this will never prove that he can frame an abstract,  general, inconsistent idea of a triangle. In like manner we may consider  Peter so far forth as man, or so far forth as animal without framing the  fore-mentioned abstract idea, either of man or of animal, inasmuch as all  that is perceived is not considered.    17. ADVANTAGE OF INVESTIGATING THE DOCTRINE OF ABSTRACT GENERAL  IDEAS.--It were an endless as well as an useless thing to trace the  SCHOOLMEN, those great masters of abstraction, through all the manifold  inextricable labyrinths of error and dispute which their doctrine of  abstract natures and notions seems to have led them into.
