Argentina's  record in material progress rivals Japan's. Argentina astonished the  world by conducting, in 1906, a trade valued at five hundred and sixty  million dollars, buying and selling more in the markets of foreign  nations than Japan, with a population of forty millions, and China,  with three hundred millions.\" [Footnote: John Barrett, in Munsey's  Magazine]    To this Land of Promise there is a large immigration. Nearly three  hundred thousand have entered in one single year. About two hundred  thousand have been going to Buenos Ayres, the capital, alone, but in  1908 nearly five hundred thousand landed there. [Footnote: \"Despite the  Government's efforts, emigration from Spain to South America takes  alarming proportions. In some districts the men of the working classes  have departed in a body. In certain villages in the neighborhood of  Cadiz there arc whole streets of deserted houses.\"-Spanish Press.] In  Belgium 220 people are crowded into the territory occupied by one  person in Argentina, so yet there is room. Albert Hale says: \"It is  undeniable that Argentina can give lodgment to 100,000,000 people, and  can furnish nourishment, at a remarkably cheap rate, for as many more,  when her whole area is utilized.\"    Argentina's schools and universities are the best in the  Spanish-speaking world. In Buenos Ayres you will find some of the  finest school buildings in the world, while 4,000 students attend one  university.    Buenos Ayres, founded in 1580, is to-day the largest city in the world  south of the equator, and is \"one of the richest and most beautiful  places of the world.\" The broad prairies around the city have made the  people \"the richest on earth.\"    Kev. John F. Thompson, for forty-five years a resident of that country,  summarizes its characteristics in the following paragraph: \"Argentina  is a _land of plenty_; plenty of room and plenty of food. If the actual  population were divided into families of ten persons, each would have a  farm of eight square miles, with ten horses, fifty-four cows, and one  hundred and eighty-six sheep, and after they had eaten their fill of  bread they would have half a ton of wheat and corn to sell or send to  the hungry nations.\"          CHAPTER I.    BUENOS AYRES IN 1889.      In the year 1889, after five weeks of ocean tossing, the steamer on  which I was a passenger anchored in the River Plate, off Buenos Ayres.  Nothing but water and sky was to be seen, for the coast was yet twenty  miles away, but the river was too shallow for the steamer to get  nearer. Large tugboats came out to us, and passengers and baggage were  transhipped into them, and we steamed ten miles nearer the still  invisible city. There smaller tugs awaited us and we were again  transhipped. Sailing once more toward the land, we soon caught sight of  the Argentine capital, but before we could sail nearer the tugs  grounded. There we were crowded into flat-bottomed, lug-sailed boats  for a third stage of our landward journey. These boats conveyed us to  within a mile of the city, when carts, drawn by five horses, met us in  the surf and drew us on to the wet, shingly beach. There about twenty  men stood, ready to carry the females on their backs on to the dry,  sandy shore, where was the customs house. The population of the city we  then entered was about six hundred thousand souls.    After changing the little gold I carried for the greasy paper currency  of the country, I started out in search of something to eat. Eventually  I found myself before a substantial meal. At a table in front of me sat  a Scotsman from the same vessel. He had arrived before me (Scotsmen say  they are always before the Englishmen) and was devouring part of a leg  of mutton. This, he told me, he had procured, to the great amusement of  Boniface, by going down on all fours and _baa-ing_ like the sheep of  his native hills. Had he waited until I arrived he might have feasted  on lamb, for my voice was not so gruff as his. He had unconsciously  asked for an old sheep. I think the Highlander in that instance  regretted that he had preceded the Englishman.    How shall I describe the metropolis of the Argentine, with its  one-storied, flat-roofed houses, each with grated windows and centre  _patio_? Some of the poorer inhabitants raise fowls on the roof, which  gives the house a barnyard appearance, while the iron-barred windows  below strongly suggest a prison. Strange yet attractive dwellings they  are, lime-washed in various colors, the favorite shades seeming to be  pink and bottle green. Fires are not used except for cooking purposes,  and the little smoke they give out is quickly dispersed by the breezes  from the sixty-mile-wide river on which the city stands.    The Buenos Ayres of 1889 was a strange place, with its long, narrow  streets, its peculiar stores and many-tongued inhabitants. There is the  dark-skinned policeman at the corner of each block sitting silently on  his horse, or galloping down the cobbled street at the sound of some  revolver, which generally tells of a life gone out. Arriving on the  scene he often finds the culprit flown. If he succeeds in riding him  down (an action he scruples not to do), he, with great show, and at the  sword's point, conducts him to the nearest police station.  Unfortunately he often chooses the quiet side streets, where his  prisoner may have a chance to buy his freedom. If he pays a few  dollars, the poor _vigilante_ is perfectly willing to lose him, after  making sometimes the pretence of a struggle to blind the lookers-on, if  there be any curious enough to interest themselves. This man in khaki  is often \"the terror of the innocent, the laughing-stock of the  guilty.\" The poor man or the foreign sailor, if he stagger ever so  little, is sure to be \"run in.\" The Argentine law-keeper (?) is  provided with both sword and revolver, but receives small remuneration,  and as his salary is often tardily paid him, he augments it in this way  when he cannot see a good opportunity of turning burglar or something  worse on his own account. When he is low in funds he will accost the  stranger, begging a   cigarette, or inviting himself at your expense to the nearest  _cafe_, as \"the day is so unusually hot.\" After all, we must not blame  him too much--his superiors are far from guiltless, and he knows it.  When Minister Toso took charge of the Provincial portfolio of Finance,  he exclaimed, \"_C-o! Todos van robando menos yo!_\" (\"Everybody is  robbing here except I.\") It is public news that President Celman  carried away to his private residence in the country a most beautiful  and expensive bronze fountain presented by the inhabitants of the city  to adorn the principal _plaza_. [Footnote: Public square.] The  president is elected by the people for a term of three years, and  invariably retires a rich man, however poor he may have been when  entering on his office. The laws of the country may be described as  model and Christian, but the carrying out of them is a very different  matter.    Some of the laws are excellent and worthy of our imitation, such as,  for example, the one which decrees that _bachelors shall be taxed_.  Civil elections are held on Sundays, the voting places being Roman  Catholic churches.    Both postmen and telegraph boys deliver on horseback, but such is the  lax custom that everything will do to-morrow. That fatal word is the  first the stranger learns--_manana_.    Comparatively few people walk the streets. \"No city in the world of  equal size and population can compare with Buenos Ayres for the number  and extent of its tramways.\" [Footnote: Turner's \"Argentina.\"] A writer  in the _Financial News_ says: \"The proportion of the population who  daily use street-cars is _sixty-six times greater in Buenos Ayres than  in the United Kingdom_.\"    This _Modern Athens_, as the Argentines love to term their city, has a  beautiful climate. For perhaps three hundred days out of every year  there is a sky above as blue as was ever seen in Naples.    The natives eat only twice a day--at 10.30 a.m., and at 7 p.m.--the  common edibles costing but little. I could write much of Buenos Ayres,  with its _carnicerias_, where a leg of mutton may be bought for 20  cts., or a brace of turkeys for 40 cts.; its _almacenes_, where one may  buy a pound of sugar or a yard of cotton, a measure of charcoal (coal  is there unknown) or a large _sombrero_, a package of tobacco (leaves  over two feet long) or a pair of white hemp-soled shoes for your  feet--all at the same counter. The customer may further obtain a bottle  of wine or a bottle of beer (the latter costing four times the price of  the former) from the same assistant, who sells at different prices to  different customers.    There the value of money is constantly changing, and almost every day  prices vary. What to-day costs $20 to-morrow may be $15, or, more  likely, $30. Although one hundred and seventy tons of sugar are  annually grown in the country, that luxury is decidedly expensive. I  have paid from 12 cts. to 30 cts. a pound. Oatmeal, the Scotsman's  dish, has cost me up to 50 cts. a pound.    Coming again on to the street you hear the deafening noises of the cow  horns blown by the streetcar drivers, or the _pescador_ shrilly  inviting housekeepers to buy the repulsive-looking red fish, carried  over his shoulder, slung on a thick bamboo. Perhaps you meet a beggar  on horseback (for there wishes _are_ horses, and beggars _do_ ride),  who piteously whines for help. This steed-riding fraternity all use  invariably the same words: _\"Por el amor de Dios dame un centavo!\"_  (\"For the love of God give me a cent.\") If you bestow it, he will call  on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7506"],[0,"The Huge Hunter; Or, The Steam Man of the Prairies (#3)"],[1,"or's, insulating it by means of the necks of some  bottles, taught the other boy the alphabet, and thus they amused  themselves sending messages back and forth.    Thus matters progressed until he was fifteen years of age, when he  came home one day, and lay down on the settee by his mother, and gave  a great sigh.    'What is the matter?' she inquired. 'I want to make something.'    'Why, then, don't you make it?'    'Because I don't know what it shall be; I've fixed up everything I can  think of.'    'And you are like Alexander, sighing for more worlds to conquer. Is  that it?'    'Not exactly, for there is plenty for one to do, if I could only find  out what it is.'    'Have you ever made a balloon?' The boy laughed.    'You were asking for the cat the other day, and wondering what had  become of her. I didn't tell you that the last I saw of her was  through the telescope, she being about two miles up in the clouds, and  going about fifty miles an hour.'    'I thought you looked as though you knew something about her,' replied  the mother, trying to speak reprovingly, and yet smiling in spite of  herself.    'Can't you tell me something to make?' finally asked the boy.    'Yes; there is something I have often thought of, and wonder why it  was not made long ago; but you are not smart enough to do it, Johnny.'    'Maybe not; but tell me what it is.'    'It is a man that shall go by steam!' The boy lay still several  minutes without speaking a word and then sprung up. 'By George! I'll  do it!' And he started out of the room, and was not seen again until  night. His mother felt no anxiety. She was pleased; for, when her boy  was at work, he was happy, and she knew that he had enough now, to  keep him engaged for months to come.    So it proved. He spent several weeks in thought, before he made the  first effort toward constructing his greatest success of all. He then  enlarged his workshop, and so arranged it, that he would not be in  danger of being seen by any curious eyes. He wanted no disturbance  while engaged upon this scheme.    From a neighboring foundry, whose proprietor took great interest in  the boy, he secured all that he needed. He was allowed full liberty to  make what castings he chose, and to construct whatever he wished. And  so he began his work.    The great point was to obtain the peculiar motion of a man walking.  This secured, the man himself could be easily made, and dressed up in  any style required. Finally the boy believed that he had hit upon the  true scheme.    So he plied harder than ever, scarcely pausing to take his meals.  Finally he got the machine together, fired up, and with feelings  somewhat akin to those, of Sir Isaac Newton, when demonstrating the  truth or falsity of some of his greatest discoveries, he watched the  result.    Soon the legs begin moving up and down, but never a step did they  advance! The power was there, sufficient to run a saw-mill, every  thing seemed to work, but the thing wouldn't go!    The boy was not ready to despair. He seated himself on the bench  beside the machine, and keeping up a moderate supply of steam,  throwing in bits of wood, and letting in water, when necessary, he  carefully watched the movement for several hours.    Occasionally, Johnny walked slowly back and forth, and with his eyes  upon the 'stately stepping,' endeavored to discover the precise nature  of that which was lacking in his machine.    At length it came to him. He saw from the first that it was not merely  required that the steam man should lift up its feet and put them down  again, but there must be a powerful forward impulse at the same  moment. This was the single remaining difficulty to be overcome. It  required two weeks before Johnny Brainerd succeeded. But it all came  clear and unmistakable at last, and in this simple manner:    (Ah! but we cannot be so unjust to the plodding genius as to divulge  his secret. Our readers must be content to await the time when the  young man sees fit to reveal it himself.)    When the rough figure was fairly in working order, the inventor  removed everything from around it, so that it stood alone in the  center of his shop. Then he carefully let on steam.    Before he could shut it off, the steam man walked clean through the  side of his shop, and fetched up against the corner of the house, with  a violence that shook it to its foundation. In considerable  trepidation, the youngster dashed forward, shut off steam, and turned  it round. As it was too cumbersome for him to manage in any other way,  he very cautiously let on steam again, and persuaded it to walk back  into the shop, passing through the same orifice through which it had  emerged, and came very nigh going out on the opposite side again.    The great thing was now accomplished, and the boy devoted himself to  bringing it as near perfection as possible. The principal thing to be  feared was its getting out of order, since the slightest  disarrangement would be sufficient to stop the progress of the man.    Johnny therefore made it of gigantic size, the body and limbs being no  more than 'Shells,' used as a sort of screen to conceal the working of  the engine. This was carefully painted in the manner mentioned in  another place, and the machinery was made as strong and durable as it  was possible for it to be. It was so constructed as to withstand the  severe jolting to which it necessarily would be subjected, and finally  was brought as nearly perfect as it was possible to bring a thing not  possessing human intelligence.    By suspending the machine so that Its feet were clear of the floor,  Johnny Brainerd ascertained that under favorable circumstances It  could run very nearly sixty miles an hour. It could easily do that,  and draw a car connected to it on the railroad, while on a common road  it could make thirty miles, the highest rate at which he believed it  possible for a wagon to be drawn upon land with any degree of safety.    It was the boy's intention to run at twenty miles an hour, while where  everything was safe, he would demonstrate the power of the invention  by occasionally making nearly double that.    As it was, he rightly calculated that when it came forth, it would  make a great sensation throughout the entire United States.                       CHAPTER IV. THE TRAPPER AND THE ARTISAN.    'HELLO, YOUNKER! what in thunder yer tryin' to make?'    Johnny Brainerd paused and looked up, not a little startled by the  strange voice and the rather singular figure which stood before him.  It was a hunter in half civilized costume, his pants tucked into his  immense boot tops, with revolvers and rifles at his waist, and a  general negligent air, which showed that he was at home in whatever  part of the world he chose to wander.    He stood with his hand in his pocket, chewing his quid, and  complacently viewing the operations of the boy, who was not a little  surprised to understand how he obtained entrance into his shop.    'Stopped at the house to ax whar old Washoe Pete keeps his hotel,'  replied the stranger, rightly surmising the query which was agitating  him, 'and I cotched a glimpse of yer old machine. Thought I'd come in  and see what in blazes it war. Looks to me like a man that's gwine to  run by steam.'    'That's just what it is,' replied the boy, seeing there was no use in  attempting to conceal the truth from the man.    'Will it do it?'    'Yes, sir.'    'Don't think you mean to lie, younker, but I don't believe any such  stuff as that.'    'It don't make any difference to me whether you believe me or not,'  was the quiet reply of the boy; 'but if you will come inside and shut  the door, and let me fasten it, so that there will be no danger of our  being disturbed, I will soon show you.'    These two personages, so unlike in almost every respect, had taken  quite a fancy to each other. The strong, hardy, bronzed trapper,  powerful in all that goes to make up the physical man, looked upon the  pale, sweet-faced boy, with his misshapen body, as an affectionate  father would look upon an afflicted child.    On the other hand, the brusque, outspoken manner of the hunter pleased  the appreciative mind of the boy, who saw much to admire, both in his  appearance and manner.    'I don't s'pose yer know me,' said the stranger, as he stepped inside  and allowed the boy to secure the door behind him.    'I never saw you before.'    'I am Baldy Bicknell, though I ginerally go by the name of 'Baldy.''    'That's rather an odd name.'    'Yas; that's the reason.'    As he spoke, the stranger removed his hat and displayed his  clean-shaven pate.    'Yer don't understand that, eh? That 'ere means I had my ha'r lifted  ten years ago. The Sioux war the skunks that done it. After they took  my top-knot off.  It had grow'd on ag'in and that's why they call me  Baldy.'    In the mean time the door had been closed, and all secured. The hat of  the steam man emptied its smoke and steam into a section of  stove-pipe, which led into the chimney, so that no suspicion of  anything unusual could disturb the passers-by in the street.    'You see it won't do to let him walk here, for when I tried it first,  he went straight through the side of the house; but you can tell by  the way in which he moves his legs, whether he is able to walk or  not.'    'That's the way we ginerally gits the p'ints of an animal,' returned  Baldy, with great complaisance, as he seated himself upon a bench to  watch the performance.    It required the boy but a short time to generate a sufficient quantity  of steam to set the legs going at a terrific rate, varying the  proceedings by letting some of the vapor through the whistle which  composed the steam man's nose.    Baldy Bicknell stood for some minutes with a surprise too great to  allow him to speak. Wonderful as was the mechanism, yet the boy who  had constructed it was still more worthy of wonder. When the steam had  given out, the"]]]
