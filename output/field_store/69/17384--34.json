Plants growing in pots were protected wholly from the light,  or had light admitted from above, or on one side as the case might require,  and were covered above by a large horizontal sheet of glass, and with  another vertical sheet on one side. A glass filament, not thicker than a  horsehair, and from a quarter to three-quarters of an inch in length, was  affixed to the part to be observed by means of shellac dissolved in  alcohol. The solution was allowed to evaporate, until it became so thick  that it set hard in two or three seconds, and it never injured the tissues,  even the tips of tender radicles, to which it was applied. To the end of  the glass filament an excessively minute bead of black sealing-wax was  cemented, below or behind which a bit of card with a black dot was fixed to  a stick driven into the ground. The weight of the filament was so slight  that even small leaves were not perceptibly pressed down. another method of  observation, when much magnification of the movement was not required, will  presently be described. The bead and the dot on the card were viewed  through the horizontal or vertical glass-plate (according to the position  of the object), and when one exactly covered the other, a dot was made on  the glass-plate with a sharply pointed stick dipped in thick Indian-ink.  Other dots were made at short intervals of time and these were afterwards  joined by straight lines. The figures thus traced were therefore angular;  but if dots had been made every 1 or 2 minutes, the lines would have been  more curvilinear, as occurred when radicles were allowed to trace their own  courses on smoked glass-plates. To make the dots accurately was the sole  difficulty, and required some practice. Nor could this be done quite  accurately, when the movement was much magnified, such as 30 times and  upwards; yet even in this case the general course may be trusted. To test  the accuracy of the above method of observation, a filament was fixed to an    * These terms are used in the sense given them by De Vries, 'WÃ¼rzburg  Arbeiten,' Heft ii 1872, p. 252.    [page 7]  inanimate object which was made to slide along a straight edge and dots  were repeatedly made on a glass-plate; when these were joined, the result  ought to have been a perfectly straight line, and the line was very nearly  straight. It may be added that when the dot on the card was placed  half-an-inch below or behind the bead of sealing-wax, and when the  glass-plate (supposing it to have been properly curved) stood at a distance  of 7 inches in front (a common distance), then the tracing represented the  movement of the bead magnified 15 times.    Whenever a great increase of the movement was not required, another, and in  some respects better, method of observation was followed. This consisted in  fixing two minute triangles of thin paper, about 1/20 inch in height, to  the two ends of the attached glass filament; and when their tips were  brought into a line so that they covered one another, dots were made as  before on the glass-plate. If we suppose the glass-plate to stand at a  distance of seven inches from the end of the shoot bearing the filament,  the dots when joined, will give nearly the same figure as if a filament  seven inches long, dipped in ink, had been fixed to the moving shoot, and  had inscribed its own course on the plate. The movement is thus  considerably magnified; for instance, if a shoot one inch in length were  bending, and the glass-plate stood at the distance of seven inches, the  movement would be magnified eight times. It would, however, have been very  difficult to have ascertained in each case how great a length of the shoot  was bending; and this is indispensable for ascertaining the degree to which  the movement is magnified.    After dots had been made on the glass-plates by either of the above  methods, they were copied on tracing paper and joined by ruled lines, with  arrows showing the direction of the movement. The nocturnal courses are  represented by straight broken lines. the first dot is always made larger  than the others, so as to catch the eye, as may be seen in the diagrams.  The figures on the glass-plates were often drawn on too large a scale to be  reproduced on the pages of this volume, and the proportion in which they  have been reduced is always given.* Whenever it could be approximately told  how much the movement had been magnified, this is stated. We have perhaps    * We are much indebted to Mr. Cooper for the care with which he has reduced  and engraved our diagrams.    [page 8]  introduced a superfluous number of diagrams; but they take up less space  than a full description of the movements. Almost all the sketches of plants  asleep, etc., were carefully drawn for us by Mr. George Darwin.    As shoots, leaves, etc., in circumnutating bend more and more, first in one  direction and then in another, they were necessarily viewed at different  times more or less obliquely; and as the dots were made on a flat surface,  the apparent amount of movement is exaggerated according to the degree of  obliquity of the point of view. It would, therefore, have been a much  better plan to have used hemispherical glasses, if we had possessed them of  all sizes, and if the bending part of the shoot had been distinctly hinged  and could have been placed so as to have formed one of the radii of the  sphere. But even in this case it would have been necessary afterwards to  have projected the figures on paper; so that complete accuracy could not  have been attained. From the distortion of our figures, owing to the above  causes, they are of no use to any one who wishes to know the exact amount  of movement, or the exact course pursued; but they serve excellently for  ascertaining whether or not the part moved at all, as well as the general  character of the movement.]    In the following chapters, the movements of a considerable number of plants  are described; and the species have been arranged according to the system  adopted by Hooker in Le Maout and Decaisne's 'Descriptive Botany.' No one  who is not investigating the present subject need read all the details,  which, however, we have thought it advisable to give. To save the reader  trouble, the conclusions and most of the more important parts have been  printed in larger type than the other parts. He may, if he thinks fit, read  the last chapter first, as it includes a summary of the whole volume; and  he will thus see what points interest him, and on which he requires the  full evidence.    Finally, we must have the pleasure of returning our  [page 9]  sincere thanks to Sir Joseph Hooker and to Mr. W. Thiselton Dyer for their  great kindness, in not only sending us plants from Kew, but in procuring  others from several sources when they were required for our observations;  also, for naming many species, and giving us information on various points.

Brassica oleracea, circumnutation of the radicle, of the arched hypocotyl  whilst still buried beneath the ground, whilst rising above the ground and  straightening itself, and when erect--Circumnutation of the cotyledons--  Rate of movement--Analogous observations on various organs in species of  Githago, Gossypium, Oxalis, Tropaeolum, Citrus, Aesculus, of several  Leguminous and Cucurbitaceous genera, Opuntia, Helianthus, Primula,  Cyclamen, Stapelia, Cerinthe, Nolana, Solanum, Beta, Ricinus, Quercus,  Corylus, Pinus, Cycas, Canna, Allium, Asparagus, Phalaris, Zea, Avena,  Nephrodium, and Selaginella.    THE following chapter is devoted to the circumnutating movements of the  radicles, hypocotyls, and cotyledons of seedling plants; and, when the  cotyledons do not rise above the ground, to the movements of the epicotyl.  But in a future chapter we shall have to recur to the movements of certain  cotyledons which sleep at night.    [Brassica oleracea (Cruciferae)'.--Fuller details will be given with  respect to the movements in this case than in any other, as space and time  will thus ultimately be saved.    Radicle.--A seed with the radicle projecting .05 inch was fastened with  shellac to a little plate of zinc, so that the radicle stood up vertically;  and a fine glass filament was then fixed near its base, that is, close to  the seed-coats. The seed was surrounded by little bits of wet sponge, and  the movement of the bead at the end of the filament was traced (Fig. 1)  during sixty hours. In this time the radicle increased in length from .05  to .11 inch. Had the filament been attached at first close to the apex of  the radicle, and if it could have remained there all the time, the movement  exhibited would have  [page 11]  been much greater, for at the close of our observations the tip, instead of  standing vertically upwards, had become bowed downwards through geotropism,  so as almost to touch the zinc plate. As far as we could roughly ascertain  by measurements made with compasses on other seeds, the tip alone, for a  length of only 2/100 to 3/100 of an inch, is acted on by geotropism. But  the tracing shows that the basal part of the radicle continued to  circumnutate irregularly during the whole time. The actual extreme amount  of movement of the bead at the end of the filament was nearly .05 inch, but  to what extent the movement of the radicle was magnified by the filament,  which was nearly 3/4 inch in length, it was impossible to estimate.

Among the authors present on this occasion was Pauline Johnson, who  contributed to the programme one of her compositions, entitled \"A  Cry from an Indian Wife\"; and when she recited without text this  much-discussed poem, which shows the Indian's side of the North-West  Rebellion, she was greeted with tremendous applause from an audience  which represented the best of Toronto's art, literature and culture.  She was the only one on the programme who received an encore, and to  this she replied with one of her favourite canoeing poems.    The following morning the entire press of Toronto asked why this  young writer was not on the platform as a professional reader;  while two of the dailies even contained editorials on the subject,  inquiring why she had never published a volume of her poems, and  insisted so strongly that the public should hear more of her,  that Mr. Frank Yeigh arranged for her to give an entire evening  in Association Hall within two weeks from the date of her first  appearance. It was for this first recital that she wrote the poem  by which she is best known, \"The Song my Paddle Sings.\"    On this eventful occasion, owing to the natural nervousness which  besets a beginner, and to the fact that she had scarcely had time  to memorize her new poem, she became confused in this particular  member, and forgot her lines. With true Indian impassiveness,  however, she never lost her self-control, but smilingly passed over  the difficulty by substituting something else; and completely won  the hearts of her audience by her coolness and self-possession. The  one thought uppermost in her mind, she afterwards said, was that she  should not leave the platform and thereby acknowledge her defeat;  and it is undoubtedly this same determination to succeed which has  carried her successfully through the many years she has been before  the public.    The immediate success of this entertainment caused Mr. Yeigh to  undertake the management of a series of recitals for her throughout  Canada, with the object of enabling her to go to England to submit  her poems to a London publisher. Within two years this end was  accomplished, and she spent the season of 1894 in London, and had  her book of poems, \"The White Wampum,\" accepted by John Lane, of the  \"Bodley Head.\" She carried with her letters of introduction from His  Excellency the Earl of Aberdeen and Rev. Professor Clark, of Toronto  University, which gave her a social and literary standing in London  which left nothing to be desired.    In London she met many authors, artists and critics, who gave this  young Canadian girl the right hand of fellowship; and she was  received and asked to give recitals in the drawing-rooms of many  diplomats, critics and members of the nobility.    Her book, \"The White Wampum,\" was enthusiastically received by the  critics and press; and was highly praised by such papers as the  Edinburgh \"Scotsman,\" \"Glasgow Herald,\" \"Manchester Guardian,\"  \"Bristol Mercury,\" \"Yorkshire Post,\" \"The Whitehall Review,\" \"Pall  Mall Gazette,\" the London \"Athenaeum,\" the London \"Academy,\" \"Black  and White,\" \"Westminster Review,\" etc.    Upon her return to Canada she made her first trip to the Pacific  Coast, giving recitals at all the cities and towns en route. Since  then she has crossed the Rocky Mountains nineteen times, and  appeared as a public entertainer at every city and town between  Halifax and Vancouver.    In 1903 the George Morang Publishing Company, of Toronto, brought  out her second book of poems, entitled \"Canadian Born,\" which was so  well received that the entire edition was exhausted within the year.    About this time she visited Newfoundland, taking with her letters  of introduction from Sir Charles Tupper to Sir Robert Bond, the  then Prime Minister of the colony. Her recital in St. John was the  literary event of the season, and was given under the personal  patronage of His Excellency the Governor-General and Lady McCallum,  and the Admiral of the British Flagship.    After this recital in the capital Miss Johnson went to all the small  seaports and to Hearts' Content, the great Atlantic Cable station,  her mission being more to secure material for magazine articles on  the staunch Newfoundlanders and their fishing villages than for the  purpose of giving recitals.    In 1906 she returned to England, and made her first appearance in  Steinway Hall, under the distinguished patronage of Lord and Lady  Strathcona, to whom she carried letters of introduction from the  Right Honourable Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Prime Minister of Canada. On  this occasion she was accompanied by Mr. Walter McRaye, who added  greatly to the Canadian interest of the programme by his inimitable  renditions of Dr. Drummond's Habitant poems.    The following year she again visited London, returning by way of the  United States, where she and Mr. McRaye were engaged by the American  Chautauquas for a series of recitals covering eight weeks, during  which time they went as far as Boulder, Colorado. Then, after one  more tour of Canada, she decided to give up public work, settle down  in the city of her choice, Vancouver, British Columbia, and devote  herself to literature only.    Only a woman of tremendous powers of endurance could have borne up  under the hardships necessarily encountered in travelling through  North-Western Canada in pioneer days as Miss Johnson did; and  shortly after settling down in Vancouver the exposure and hardship  she had endured began to tell upon her, and her health completely  broke down. For more than a year she has been an invalid; and as she  was not able to attend to the business herself, a trust was formed  by some of the leading citizens of her adopted city for the purpose  of collecting, and publishing for her benefit, her later works.  Among these is a number of beautiful Indian legends which she has  been at great pains to collect; and a splendid series of boys'  stories, which were exceedingly well received when they ran recently  in an American boys' magazine.    During the sixteen years Miss Johnson was travelling she had many  varied and interesting experiences. She has driven up the old  Battleford trail before the railroad went through, and across the  Boundary country in British Columbia in the romantic days of the  early pioneers; and once she took an 850-mile drive up the Cariboo  trail to the gold-fields. She was always an ardent canoeist, ran  many strange rivers, crossed many a lonely lake, and camped in many  an unfrequented place. These venturous trips she took more from her  inherent love of nature and of adventure than from any necessity  of her profession.    After an illness of two years' duration Miss Johnson died in  Vancouver on March 7, 1913. The heroic spirit in which she endured  long months of suffering is expressed in her poem entitled \"And He  Said 'Fight On'\" which she wrote after she was informed by her  physician that her illness would prove fatal.      Time and its ally, Dark Disarmament        Have compassed me about;    Have massed their armies, and on battle bent        My forces put to rout,    But though I fight alone, and fall, and die,        Talk terms of Peace? Not I.    It is eminently fitting that this daughter of Nature should have  been laid to rest in no urban cemetery. According to her own request  she was buried in Stanley Park, Vancouver's beautiful heritage of  the forest primeval. A simple stone surrounded by rustic palings  marks her grave and on this stone is carved the one word \"Pauline.\"  There she lies among ferns and wild flowers a short distance from  Siwash Rock, the story of which she has recorded in the legends of  her race. In time to come a pathway to her grave will be worn by  lovers of Canadian poetry who will regard it as one of the most  romantic of our literary shrines.        THE WHITE WAMPUM    (The following poems are from the author's first book, \"The White  Wampum,\" first published in 1895.)        OJISTOH      I am Ojistoh, I am she, the wife  Of him whose name breathes bravery and life  And courage to the tribe that calls him chief.  I am Ojistoh, his white star, and he  Is land, and lake, and sky--and soul to me.    Ah! but they hated him, those Huron braves,  Him who had flung their warriors into graves,  Him who had crushed them underneath his heel,  Whose arm was iron, and whose heart was steel  To all--save me, Ojistoh, chosen wife  Of my great Mohawk, white star of his life.    Ah! but they hated him, and councilled long  With subtle witchcraft how to work him wrong;  How to avenge their dead, and strike him where  His pride was highest, and his fame most fair.  Their hearts grew weak as women at his name:  They dared no war-path since my Mohawk came  With ashen bow, and flinten arrow-head  To pierce their craven bodies; but their dead  Must be avenged. Avenged? They dared not walk  In day and meet his deadly tomahawk;  They dared not face his fearless scalping knife;  So--Niyoh![1]--then they thought of me, his wife.    O! evil, evil face of them they sent  With evil Huron speech: \"Would I consent  To take of wealth? be queen of all their tribe?  Have wampum ermine?\" Back I flung the bribe  Into their teeth, and said, \"While I have life  Know this--Ojistoh is the Mohawk's wife.\"    Wah! how we struggled! But their arms were strong.  They flung me on their pony's back, with thong  Round ankle, wrist, and shoulder. Then upleapt  The one I hated most: his eye he swept  Over my misery, and sneering said,  \"Thus, fair Ojistoh, we avenge our dead.\"    And we two rode, rode as a sea wind-chased,  I, bound with buckskin to his hated waist,  He, sneering, laughing, jeering, while he lashed  The horse to foam, as on and on we dashed.
