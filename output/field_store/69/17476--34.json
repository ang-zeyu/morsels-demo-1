It appeared that they had  slapped the Sphinx to vex her out of her apathy in order that she  should pray to one of her gods, whom she had littered in the house of  Time; but her moody silence was invincible, and her apathy Oriental,  ever since the deed had happened. And when they found that they could  not make her pray, there was nothing for them to do but to pay little  useless attentions to the rusty lock of the door, and to look at the  deed and wonder, and even pretend to hope, and to say that after all  it might not bring that destined thing from the forest, which no one  named.    It may be said I had chosen a gruesome house, but not if I had  described the forest from which I came, and I was in need of any spot  wherein I could rest my mind from the thought of it.    I wondered very much what thing would come from the forest on account  of the deed; and having seen that forest--as you, gentle reader, have  not--I had the advantage of knowing that anything might come. It was  useless to ask the Sphinx--she seldom reveals things, like her  paramour Time (the gods take after her), and while this mood was on  her, rebuff was certain. So I quietly began to oil the lock of the  door. And as soon as they saw this simple act I won their confidence.  It was not that my work was of any use--it should have been done long  before; but they saw that my interest was given for the moment to the  thing that they thought vital. They clustered round me then. They  asked me what I thought of the door, and whether I had seen better,  and whether I had seen worse; and I told them about all the doors I  knew, and said that the doors of the baptistry in Florence were better  doors, and the doors made by a certain firm of builders in London were  worse. And then I asked them what it was that was coming after the  Sphinx because of the deed. And at first they would not say, and I  stopped oiling the door; and then they said that it was the  arch-inquisitor of the forest, who is investigator and avenger of all  silverstrian things; and from all that they said about him it seemed to me  that this person was quite white, and was a kind of madness that would  settle down quite blankly upon a place, a kind of mist in which reason  could not live; and it was the fear of this that made them fumble  nervously at the lock of that rotten door; but with the Sphinx it was  not so much fear as sheer prophecy.    The hope that they tried to hope was well enough in its way, but I did  not share it; it was clear that the thing that they feared was the  corollary of the deed--one saw that more by the resignation upon the  face of the Sphinx than by their sorry anxiety for the door.    The wind soughed, and the great tapers flared, and their obvious fear  and the silence of the Sphinx grew more than ever a part of the  atmosphere, and bats went restlessly through the gloom of the wind  that beat the tapers low.    Then a few things screamed far off, then a little nearer, and  something was coming towards us, laughing hideously. I hastily gave a  prod to the door that they guarded; my finger sank right into the  mouldering wood--there was not a chance of holding it. I had not  leisure to observe their fright; I thought of the back-door, for the  forest was better than this; only the Sphinx was absolutely calm, her  prophecy was made and she seemed to have seen her doom, so that no new  thing could perturb her.    But by mouldering rungs of ladders as old as Man, by slippery edges of  the dreaded abyss, with an ominous dizziness about my heart and a  feeling of horror in the soles of my feet, I clambered from tower to  tower till I found the door that I sought; and it opened on to one of  the upper branches of a huge and sombre pine, down which I climbed on  to the floor of the forest. And I was glad to be back again in the  forest from which I had fled.    And the Sphinx in her menaced house--I know not how she fared--whether  she gazes for ever, disconsolate, at the deed, remembering only in her  smitten mind, at which the little boys now leer, that she once knew  well those things at which man stands aghast; or whether in the end  she crept away, and clambering horribly from abyss to abyss, came at  last to higher things, and is wise and eternal still. For who knows of  madness whether it is divine or whether it be of the pit?        PROBABLE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE LITERARY MEN      When the nomads came to El Lola they had no more songs, and the  question of stealing the golden box arose in all its magnitude. On the  one hand, many had sought the golden box, the receptacle (as the  Aethiopians know) of poems of fabulous value; and their doom is still  the common talk of Arabia. On the other hand, it was lonely to sit  around the camp-fire by night with no new songs.    It was the tribe of Heth that discussed these things one evening upon  the plains below the peak of Mluna. Their native land was the track  across the world of immemorial wanderers; and there was trouble among  the elders of the nomads because there were no new songs; while,  untouched by human trouble, untouched as yet by the night that was  hiding the plains away, the peak of Mluna, calm in the after-glow,  looked on the Dubious Land. And it was there on the plain upon the  known side of Mluna, just as the evening star came mouse-like into  view and the flames of the camp-fire lifted their lonely plumes  uncheered by any song, that that rash scheme was hastily planned by  the nomads which the world has named The Quest of the Golden Box.    No measure of wiser precaution could the elders of the nomads have  taken than to choose for their thief that very Slith, that identical  thief that (even as I write) in how many school-rooms governesses  teach stole a march on the King of Westalia. Yet the weight of the box  was such that others had to accompany him, and Sippy and Slorg were no  more agile thieves than may be found today among vendors of the  antique.    So over the shoulder of Mluna these three climbed next day and slept  as well as they might among its snows rather than risk a night in the  woods of the Dubious Land. And the morning came up radiant and the  birds were full of song, but the forest underneath and the waste  beyond it and the bare and ominous crags all wore the appearance of an  unuttered threat.    Though Slith had an experience of twenty years of theft, yet he said  little; only if one of the others made a stone roll with his foot, or,  later on in the forest, if one of them stepped on a twig, he whispered  sharply to them always the same words: \"That is not business.\" He knew  that he could not make them better thieves during a two days' journey,  and whatever doubts he had he interfered no further.    From the shoulder of Mluna they dropped into the clouds, and from the  clouds to the forest, to whose native beasts, as well the three  thieves knew, all flesh was meat, whether it were the flesh of fish or  man. There the thieves drew idolatrously from their pockets each one a  separate god and prayed for protection in the unfortunate wood, and  hoped therefrom for a threefold chance of escape, since if anything  should eat one of them it were certain to eat them all, and they  confided that the corollary might be true and all should escape if one  did. Whether one of these gods was propitious and awake, or whether  all of the three, or whether it was chance that brought them through  the forest unmouthed by detestable beasts, none knoweth; but certainly  neither the emissaries of the god that most they feared, nor the wrath  of the topical god of that ominous place, brought their doom to the  three adventurers there or then. And so it was that they came to  Rumbly Heath, in the heart of the Dubious Land, whose stormy hillocks  were the ground-swell and the after-wash of the earthquake lulled for  a while. Something so huge that it seemed unfair to man that it should  move so softly stalked splendidly by them, and only so barely did they  escape its notice that one word rang and echoed through their three  imaginations--\"If--if--if.\" And when this danger was at last gone by  they moved cautiously on again and presently saw the little harmless  mipt, half fairy and half gnome, giving shrill, contented squeaks on  the edge of the world. And they edged away unseen, for they said that  the inquisitiveness of the mipt had become fabulous, and that,  harmless as he was, he had a bad way with secrets; yet they probably  loathed the way that he nuzzles dead white bones, and would not admit  their loathing; for it does not become adventurers to care who eats  their bones. Be this as it may, they edged away from the mipt, and  came almost at once to the wizened tree, the goal-post of their  adventure, and knew that beside them was the crack in the world and  the bridge from Bad to Worse, and that underneath them stood the rocky  house of Owner of the Box.    This was their simple plan: to slip into the corridor in the upper  cliff; to run softly down it (of course with naked feet) under the  warning to travellers that is graven upon stone, which interpreters  take to be \"It Is Better Not\"; not to touch the berries that are there  for a purpose, on the right side going down; and so to come to the  guardian on his pedestal who had slept for a thousand years and should  be sleeping still; and go in through the open window. One man was to  wait outside by the crack in the World until the others came out with  the golden box, and, should they cry for help, he was to threaten at  once to unfasten the iron clamp that kept the crack together. When the  box was secured they were to travel all night and all the following  day, until the cloud-banks that wrapped the slopes of Mluna were well  between them and Owner of the Box.    The door in the cliff was open. They passed without a murmur down the  cold steps, Slith leading them all the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7498"],[0,"Five Little Peppers Grown Up (#3)"],[1,"on either side, to prove  her words, and was by no means reassured to see the countenance of Billy  Harlow, one of his young business friends, across the aisle, suffused  with an attempt to appear as if he hadn't been a witness to the little  by-play.    \"Well, I'm morally certain I won't trouble you with another invitation  to a concert,\" he said, too furious to quite know his own words.    \"You needn't,\" said Alexia, swinging her fan with an even hand, and  still smiling sweetly, this time including in it Billy, who had no girl  with him. \"I really could endure life at home better than this bliss.\"  And then D'Albert came on the stage, and it was the proper thing to keep  quiet, so the hostilities died down.    Going out of the Opera House, Billy Harlow ran up to the two. \"Lovely  time you've had,\" he said on Alexia's side, and with a little grimace.    \"Haven't I?\" said Alexia back again, with the air of a martyr. Pickering  stalking along by her side, had the air of a man who didn't care what  was being said about him.    \"Just look at him now,\" said Alexia softly, \"isn't he sweet? And fancy  my bearing it for two hours. I don't think any other girl in our set,  could.\"    \"Why didn't Miss Pepper come this evening?\" asked Mr. Harlow curiously;  \"Pickering said he'd asked her.\"    \"Oh! she gave it up to help some girl,\" said Alexia carelessly. \"She's  the music teacher at Miss Salisbury's school, you know.\"    \"Oh! is she?\" asked Mr. Harlow innocently, forgetting to mention the  daily interviews he sustained with his sisters Kitty and Grace who were  \"Salisbury girls,\" on Miss Pepper's movements.    \"And at the last minute he asked me to take her place,\" said Alexia with  perfect frankness, \"and I was goose enough to do it.\"    \"Isn't Miss Pepper going to give a Recital pretty soon?\" asked Mr.  Harlow, incidentally, as they worked their way along to the entrance.    \"Yes, she is,\" said Alexia sharply, \"at the Exeter--we can't stop her;  she says she's proud to do it, and it shows the girls' wonderful  ability; and all that sort of thing--and--and--oh dear me! after she's  once done that, she'll always be 'Miss Pepper the music teacher.' Isn't  it horrid!\"    \"I believe that is our carriage,\" said Pickering stiffly, and without so  much as a half-glance at Billy. \"Come, Alexia.\"          CHAPTER II    GETTING READY FOR CHRISTMAS.      \"Baby ought to have a Christmas Tree,\" said Phronsie slowly.    \"Ah--King-Fisher, how is that? Do you want a Christmas Tree?\" Jasper  dropped to all-fours by the side of the white bundle in the center of  the library rug, as he propounded the momentous question.    The Baby plunged forward and buried both fat hands in the crop of brown  hair so suddenly brought to his notice.    \"Is that the way to show your acknowledgment, sir?\" cried Jasper,  springing to his feet, Baby and all. \"Well, there you go--there, and  there, and there!\" tossing the white bundle high in the air.    \"Goodness! what a breeze you two contrive to raise,\" exclaimed Joel;  \"Mamsie,\" as Mother Fisher put her head in the doorway, \"the little chap  is getting the worst of it, I tell you.\"    \"Joel's jealous,\" said Jasper, with a laugh. \"Take care, King-Fisher,  that really is my hair, sir.\"    Mrs. Fisher nodded and chuckled to the baby, and hurried off.    \"He didn't really mean to pull your hair, Jasper,\" said Phronsie in a  worried way; and getting up from the floor where she had been deserted  by the baby, she hurried over to the two flying around in the center of  the room.    \"But he does pull dreadfully, though,\" said Polly, laughing, \"don't you,  you little King!\" pinching Baby's toes as Jasper spun him past her.    \"My goodness!\" exclaimed Mr. King, coming in the opposite doorway, \"I  should think it was a menagerie here! What's the matter, Phronsie?\"    \"Baby is pulling Jasper's hair,\" said Phronsie slowly, and revolving  around the two dancers, \"but he really doesn't mean to, Grandpapa.\"    \"Oh! I hope he does,\" said old Mr. King cheerfully, coming in and  sitting down in his favorite chair. \"I'm sure it speaks well for the  young man's powers of self-defense, if he gives Jasper a good tweak.\"    \"Father!\" cried Jasper in pretended astonishment. \"Well, King-Fisher, as  popular opinion is against me, I'll set you down again, and nurse my  poor scalp,\" and down went the white bundle again to the floor, Phronsie  going back to her post as nurse.    \"There's been a terrible scheme worked up since you were out, sir,\"  announced Joel to the old gentleman.    \"Hey--what's that?\" demanded Mr. King, staring at Polly.    \"Oh! it isn't Polly this time,\" said Joel with a laugh. \"Generally it is  Polly that sets all dreadful things going; but this time, it is some  other ringleader.\"    \"Then I am sure I sha'n't approve if Polly isn't in it,\" declared the  old gentleman flatly.    \"But I am in it, Grandpapa,\" Polly made haste to say. \"I think it is  very, very nice.\"    \"That alters the case,\" said Mr. King. \"So what is it, Joe? Out with  it.\"    \"It's nothing more nor less than to upset this house from top to  bottom,\" said Joel, \"and get up a dreadful howling, tearing Christmas  Tree.\"    [Illustration: \"BABY OUGHT TO HAVE A CHRISTMAS TREE,\" SAID PHRONSIE  SLOWLY.]    \"Oh, Joe Pepper!\" ejaculated Polly reproachfully, \"and you've always had  such fun over our Christmas Trees. How can you!\"    \"It's for Baby,\" cried Phronsie, with a pink flush on her cheek. \"He's  never seen one, you know, Grandpapa.\"    \"No, I should think not,\" said the old gentleman, looking down at the  white bundle. \"Well, and so you want a Christmas Tree for him, Phronsie  child?\"    \"I think we ought to have one,\" said Phronsie, \"because you know, he's  never, never seen one. And we all have had so many beautiful Trees,  Grandpapa.\"    \"To be sure, to be sure,\" said Mr. King. \"Well now, Phronsie child, come  here and tell me all about it,\" and he held out his hand.    Phronsie cast an anxious glance at the bundle. \"Can I leave him,  Grandpapa?\" she asked.    \"Leave him? Mercy, yes; it does babies good to be left alone. He'll suck  his thumbs or his toes.\"    \"I'll stay with him,\" said Polly, running out of her corner to get on  her knees before the baby. \"There now, sir, do you know what a blessed  old care you are?\" smothering him with kisses.    \"Yes, I really think we ought to have a Christmas Tree,\" Phronsie was  saying, \"Grandpapa dear,\" huddling up against his waistcoat as usual.    \"Then we surely will have one,\" declared old Mr. King, \"so that is  settled. Do you hear, young people,\" raising his voice, \"or does that  little scamp of a baby take all your ears?\"    \"We hear, Grandpapa,\" said Polly from the floor, \"and I'm very glad. It  will be good fun to get up a Christmas Tree.\"    \"Seeing you never have had that pleasing employment,\" said Jasper  _sotto voce_, on the rug before the fire.    \"Never mind; it'll be just as good fun again,\" said Polly.    \"And not a bit of work--oh, no!\"    \"Don't throw cold water on it,\" begged Polly under her breath, while the  baby scrambled all over her, \"don't, Jasper; Phronsie has set her heart  on it.\"    \"All right; but I thought you wanted every bit of time to get ready for  your Recital, and the other things; and then, besides, there's  Phronsie's performance down at Dunraven.\"    \"Well, so I did,\" confessed Polly, with a sigh, \"but I can get the time  some way.\"    \"Out of 'the other things,'\" said Jasper grimly. \"Polly, you'll have no  fun from the holidays. It isn't too late to stop this now.\" He darted  over toward his father.    \"Jasper!\" cried Polly imploringly.    \"What is it, my boy?\" asked Mr. King, quite deep in the plans for the  Tree, Joel having added himself to their company.    \"Oh, nothing; Polly wants it, and we must make it a good one,\" said  Jasper, rather incoherently, and beginning to retreat.    \"Of course it will be a good one,\" said his father, a trifle testily,  \"if we have it at all. When did we ever get up a poor Tree, pray tell?\"    Polly drew a relieved breath, and gathering the baby up in her arms, she  hurried over to the old gentleman's chair with a \"Now when do you want  to have the Tree, Phronsie?\"    \"Must we have it Christmas Day?\" asked Phronsie, looking at her  anxiously.    \"Christmas Day? Dear me, no! Why, what would the Dunraven children do,  Phronsie, if you took that day away from them?\" cried old Mr. King in  astonishment.    Phronsie turned slowly back to him. \"I thought perhaps we ought to let  Baby have the Tree Christmas Day,\" she said.    \"No, indeed,\" again said Mr. King. \"Come here, you little scamp,\"  catching the baby out of Polly's hand, to set him on his other knee;  \"there now, speak up like a man, and tell your sister that you are not  particular about the time you have your Tree.\"    \"Ar--goo!\" said the Fisher baby.    \"That's it,\" said the old gentleman with approval, while the others  shouted. \"So now, as long as your brother says so, Phronsie, why, I  should have your Tree the day before Christmas.\"    \"Oh, Polly wants to go\"--began Jasper.    \"Ugh!\" cried Polly warningly to him. \"Yes, Phronsie; you much better  have it the day before, as Grandpapa says.\"    \"And you don't suppose Baby will feel badly afterwards when he gets  bigger, and cry because we didn't give him Christmas Day,\" said  Phronsie, \"do you, Grandpapa?\"    \"Indeed, I don't,\" declared the old gentleman, pinching the set of pink  toes nearest to his hand; \"if he does, why, we'll all let him know what  we think of such conduct.\"    \"Then,\" said Phronsie, clasping her hands, \"I should very much rather  not take Christmas Day from the Dunraven children, because you know,  Grandpapa, they expect it.\"    \"Of course they do,\" said old Mr. King. \"Bless me! why, we shouldn't  know it was Christmas at all, if we didn't go down to Bedford and carry  it; and as for those children\"--    The picture that this brought up, of Dunraven without a Christmas, threw  such a"]]]
