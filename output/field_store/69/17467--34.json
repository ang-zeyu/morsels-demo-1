That works, the results of which are  transitory, are contrary to final release, and that such release can be  effected through knowledge only, scripture declares in many places;  compare all the passages quoted above (p. 7).    As to the assertion that knowledge requires sacrifices and other works,  we remark that--as follows from the essential contrariety of knowledge  and works, and as further appears from an accurate consideration of the  words of scripture--pious works can contribute only towards the rise of  the desire of knowledge, in so far namely as they clear the internal  organ (of knowledge), but can have no influence on the production of the  fruit, i.e. knowledge itself. For the scriptural passage concerned runs  as follows Brâhmanas desire to know him by the study of the Veda, by  sacrifice, by gifts,' &c. (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 22).    According to this passage, the desire only of knowledge springs up  through works; while another text teaches that calmness, self-restraint,  and so on, are the direct means for the origination of knowledge itself.  (Having become tranquil, calm, subdued, satisfied, patient, and  collected, he is to see the Self within the Self (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 23).)    The process thus is as follows. After the mind of a man has been cleaned  of all impurities through works performed in many preceding states of  existence, without a view to special forms of reward, there arises in  him the desire of knowledge, and thereupon--through knowledge itself  originated by certain scriptural texts--'Being only, this was in the  beginning, one only without a second' (Ch. Up. VI, I, 2); 'Truth,  Knowledge, the Infinite, is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'Without parts,  without actions, calm, without fault, without taint' (Svet. Up. VI, 19);  'This Self is Brahman' (Bri. Up. II, 5, 19); 'Thou art that' (Ch. Up. VI,  9, 7), Nescience comes to an end. Now, 'Hearing,' 'reflection,' and  'meditation,' are helpful towards cognising the sense of these Vedic  texts. 'Hearing' (sravana) means the apprehension of the sense of  scripture, together with collateral arguments, from a teacher who  possesses the true insight, viz. that the Vedânta-texts establish the  doctrine of the unity of the Self. 'Reflection' (mananam) means the  confirmation within oneself of the sense taught by the teacher, by means  of arguments showing it alone to be suitable. 'Meditation'  (nididhyâsanam) finally means the constant holding of thai sense before  one's mind, so as to dispel thereby the antagonistic beginningless  imagination of plurality. In the case of him who through 'hearing,'  'reflection,' and meditation,' has dis-dispelled the entire imagination  of plurality, the knowledge of the sense of Vedânta-texts puts an end to  Nescience; and what we therefore require is a statement of the  indispensable prerequisites of such 'hearing,' 'reflection,' and so on.  Now of such prerequisites there are four, viz. discrimination of what is  permanent and what is non-permanent; the full possession of calmness of  mind, self-restraint and similar means; the renunciation of all  enjoyment of fruits here below as well as in the next world; and the  desire of final release.    Without these the desire of knowledge cannot arise; and they are  therefore known, from the very nature of the matter, to be necessary  prerequisites. To sum up: The root of bondage is the unreal view of  plurality which itself has its root in Nescience that conceals the true  being of Brahman. Bondage itself thus is unreal, and is on that account  cut short, together with its root, by mere knowledge. Such knowledge is  originated by texts such as 'That art thou'; and work is of no help  either towards its nature, or its origination, or its fruit (i.e.  release). It is on the other hand helpful towards the desire of  knowledge, which arises owing to an increase of the element of goodness  (sattva) in the soul, due to the destruction of the elements of passion  (rajas) and darkness (tamas) which are the root of all moral evil. This  use is referred to in the text quoted above, 'Brâhmanas wish to know him,'  &c. As, therefore, the knowledge of works is of no use towards the  knowledge of Brahman, we must acknowledge as the prerequisite of the  latter knowledge the four means mentioned above.          THE SMALL SIDDHÂNTA.    To this argumentation we make the following reply. We admit that release  consists only in the cessation of Nescience, and that this cessation  results entirely from the knowledge of Brahman. But a distinction has  here to be made regarding the nature of this knowledge which the  Vedânta-texts aim at enjoining for the purpose of putting an end to  Nescience. Is it merely the knowledge of the sense of sentences which  originates from the sentences? or is it knowledge in the form of  meditation (upâsana) which has the knowledge just referred to as its  antecedent? It cannot be knowledge of the former kind: for such  knowledge springs from the mere apprehension of the sentence, apart from  any special injunction, and moreover we do not observe that the  cessation of Nescience is effected by such knowledge merely. Our  adversary will perhaps attempt to explain things in the following way.  The Vedânta-texts do not, he will say, produce that knowledge which  makes an end of Nescience, so long as the imagination of plurality is  not dispelled. And the fact that such knowledge, even when produced,  does not at once and for every one put a stop to the view of plurality  by no means subverts my opinion; for, to mention an analogous instance,  the double appearance of the moon--presenting itself to a person  affected with a certain weakness of vision--does not come to an end as  soon as the oneness of the moon has been apprehended by reason.  Moreover, even without having come to an end, the view of plurality is  powerless to effect further bondage, as soon as the root, i.e.  Nescience, has once been cut But this defence we are unable to admit. It  is impossible that knowledge should not arise when its means, i.e. the  texts conveying knowledge, are once present. And we observe that even  when there exists an antagonistic imagination (interfering with the rise  of knowledge), information given by competent persons, the presence of  characteristic marks (on which a correct inference may be based), and  the like give rise to knowledge which sublates the erroneous  imagination. Nor can we admit that even after the sense of texts has  been apprehended, the view of plurality may continue owing to some small  remainder of beginningless imagination. For as this imagination which  constitutes the means for the view of plurality is itself false, it is  necessarily put an end to by the rise of true knowledge. If this did not  take place, that imagination would never come to an end, since there is  no other means but knowledge to effect its cessation. To say that the  view of plurality, which is the effect of that imagination, continues  even after its root has been cut, is mere nonsense. The instance of some  one seeing the moon double is not analogous. For in his case the  non-cessation of wrong knowledge explains itself from the circumstance  that the cause of wrong knowledge, viz. the real defect of the eye which  does not admit of being sublated by knowledge, is not removed, although  that which would sublate wrong knowledge is near. On the other hand,  effects, such as fear and the like, may come to an end because they can  be sublated by means of knowledge of superior force. Moreover, if it  were true that knowledge arises through the dispelling of the  imagination of plurality, the rise of knowledge would really never be  brought about. For the imagination of plurality has through gradual  growth in the course of beginningless time acquired an infinite  strength, and does not therefore admit of being dispelled by the  comparatively weak conception of non-duality. Hence we conclude that the  knowledge which the Vedânta-texts aim at inculcating is a knowledge  other than the mere knowledge of the sense of sentences, and denoted by  'dhyâna,' 'upâsanâ' (i. e. meditation), and similar terms.    With this agree scriptural texts such as 'Having known it, let him  practise meditation' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 21); 'He who, having searched out  the Self, knows it' (Ch. Up. VIII, 7, 1); 'Meditate on the Self as Om'  (Mu. Up. II, 2, 6); 'Having known that, he is freed from the jaws of  death' (Ka. Up. I, 3, 15); 'Let a man meditate on the Self only as his  world' (Bri. Up. I, 4, 15); 'The Self is to be seen, to be heard, to her  reflected on, to be meditated on' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 6); 'That we must  search out, that we must try to understand' (Ch. Up. VIII, 7, 1).    (According to the principle of the oneness of purport of the different  sâkhâs) all these texts must be viewed as agreeing in meaning with the  injunction of meditation contained in the passage quoted from the Bri.  Up.; and what they enjoin is therefore meditation. In the first and  second passages quoted, the words 'having known' and 'having searched  out' (vijñâya; anuvidya) contain a mere reference to (not injunction of)  the apprehension of the meaning of texts, such apprehension subserving  meditation; while the injunction of meditation (which is the true  purport of the passages) is conveyed by the clauses 'let him practise  meditation' (prajñâm kurvîta) and 'he knows it.' In the same way the  clause 'the Self is to be heard' is a mere anuvâda, i.e. a mere  reference to what is already established by other means; for a person  who has read the Veda observes that it contains instruction about  matters connected with certain definite purposes, and then on his own  account applies himself to methodical 'hearing,' in order definitely to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7298"],[0,"William Tell Told Again (#3)"],[1,"called upon the Governor.\"    \"Well, and you didn't either!\" snapped Arnold of Melchthal, whose  finger still hurt him, and made him a little bad-tempered.    \"That,\" said Arnold of Sewa, \"I put down entirely to the fact that you  and your friends, by not exercising tact, irritated the Governor, and  made him unwilling to listen to anybody else. Nothing is more important  in these affairs than tact. That's what you want--tact. But have it  your own way. Don't mind _me!_\"    And the citizens did not. They chose Werner Stauffacher, Arnold of  Melchthal, and Walter Fuerst, and, having drained their glasses, the  three trudged up the steep hill which led to Tell's house.    It had been agreed that everyone should wait at the Glass and Glacier  until the three spokesmen returned, in order that they might hear the  result of their mission. Everybody was very anxious. A revolution  without Tell would be quite impossible, and it was not unlikely that  Tell might refuse to be their leader. The worst of a revolution is  that, if it fails, the leader is always executed as an example to the  rest. And many people object to being executed, however much it may set  a good example to their friends. On the other hand, Tell was a brave  man and a patriot, and might be only too eager to try to throw off the  tyrant's yoke, whatever the risk. They had waited about an hour, when  they saw the three spokesmen coming down the hill. Tell was not with  them, a fact which made the citizens suspect that he had refused their  offer. The first thing a man does when he has accepted the leadership  of a revolution is to come and plot with his companions.    \"Well?\" said everybody eagerly, as the three arrived.    Werner Stauffacher shook his head.    \"Ah,\" said Arnold of Sewa, \"I see what it is. He has refused. You  didn't exercise tact, and he refused.\"    \"We _did_ exercise tact,\" said Stauffacher indignantly; \"but he  would not be persuaded. It was like this: We went to the house and  knocked at the door. Tell opened it. 'Good-morning,' I said.    \"'Good-morning,' said he. 'Take a seat.'    \"I took a seat.    \"'My heart is full,' I said, 'and longs to speak with you.' I thought  that a neat way of putting it.\"    The company murmured approval.    \"'A heavy heart,' said Tell, 'will not  grow light with words.'\"    \"Not bad that!\" murmured Jost Weiler. \"Clever way of putting things,  Tell has got.\"    \"'Yet words,' I said, 'might lead us on to deeds.'\"    \"Neat,\" said Jost Weiler--\"very neat. Yes?\"    \"To which Tell's extraordinary reply was: 'The only thing to do is to  sit still.'    \"'What!' I said; 'bear in silence things unbearable?'    \"'Yes,' said Tell; 'to peaceable men peace is gladly granted. When the  Governor finds that his oppression does not make us revolt, he will  grow tired of oppressing.'\"    \"And what did you say to that?\" asked Ulric the smith.    \"I said he did not know the Governor if he thought he could ever grow  tired of oppressing. 'We might do much,' I said, 'if we held fast  together. Union is strength,' I said.    \"'The strong,' said Tell, 'is strongest when he stands alone.'    \"'Then our country must not count on thee,' I said, 'when in despair  she stands on self-defence?'    \"'Oh, well,' he said, 'hardly that, perhaps. I don't want to desert  you. What I mean to say is, I'm no use as a plotter or a counsellor and  that sort of thing. Where I come out strong is in deeds. So don't  invite me to your meetings and make me speak, and that sort of thing;  but if you want a man to _do_ anything--why, that's where I shall  come in, you see. Just write if you want me--a postcard will do--and  you will not find William Tell hanging back. No, sir.' And with those  words he showed us out.\"    \"Well,\" said Jost Weiler, \"I call that encouraging. All we have to do  now is to plot. Let us plot.\"    \"Yes, let's!\" shouted everybody.    Ulric the smith rapped for silence on the table.    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"our friend Mr. Klaus von der Flue will now read  a paper on 'Governors--their drawbacks, and how to get rid of them.'  Silence, gentlemen, please. Now, then, Klaus, old fellow, speak up and  get it over.\"    And the citizens settled down without further delay to a little serious  plotting.          CHAPTER V      A few days after this, Hedwig gave Tell a good talking to on the  subject of his love for adventure. He was sitting at the door of his  house mending an axe. Hedwig, as usual, was washing up. Walter and  William were playing with a little cross-bow not far off.    \"Father,\" said Walter.    \"Yes, my boy?\"    \"My bow-string has bust.\" (\"Bust\" was what all Swiss boys said when  they meant \"broken.\")    \"You must mend it yourself, my boy,\" said Tell. \"A sportsman always  helps himself.\"    \"What _I_ say,\" said Hedwig, bustling out of the house, \"is that a  boy of his age has no business to be shooting. I don't like it.\"    \"Nobody can shoot well if he does not begin to practise early. Why,  when I was a boy--I remember on one occasion, when--\"    \"What _I_ say,\" interrupted Hedwig, \"is that a boy ought not to  want always to be shooting, and what not. He ought to stay at home and  help his mother. And I wish you would set them a better example.\"    \"Well, the fact is, you know,\" said Tell, \"I don't think Nature meant  me to be a stay-at-home and that sort of thing. I couldn't be a  herdsman if you paid me. I shouldn't know what to do. No; everyone has  his special line, and mine is hunting. Now, I _can_ hunt.\"    \"A nasty, dangerous occupation,\" said Hedwig. \"I don't like to hear of  your being lost on desolate ice-fields, and leaping from crag to crag,  and what not. Some day, mark my words, if you are not careful, you will  fall down a precipice, or be overtaken by an avalanche, or the ice will  break while you are crossing it. There are a thousand ways in which you  might get hurt.\"    \"A man of ready wit with a quick eye,\" replied Tell complacently,  \"never gets hurt. The mountain has no terror for her children. I am a  child of the mountain.\"    \"You are certainly a child!\" snapped Hedwig. \"It is no use my arguing  with you.\"    \"Not very much,\" agreed Tell, \"for I am just off to the town. I have an  appointment with your papa and some other gentlemen.\"    (I forgot to say so before, but Hedwig was the daughter of Walter  Fuerst.)    \"Now, _what_ are you and papa plotting?\" asked Hedwig. \"I know  there is something going on. I suspected it when papa brought Werner  Stauffacher and the other man here, and you wouldn't let me listen.  What is it? Some dangerous scheme, I suppose?\"    \"Now, how in the world do you get those sort of ideas into your head?\"  Tell laughed. \"Dangerous scheme! As if I should plot dangerous schemes  with your papa!\"    \"I know,\" said Hedwig. \"You can't deceive _me!_ There is a plot  afoot against the Governor, and you are in it.\"    \"A man must help his country.\"    \"They're sure to place you where there is most danger. I know them.  Don't go. Send Walter down with a note to say that you regret that an  unfortunate previous engagement, which you have just recollected, will  make it impossible for you to accept their kind invitation to plot.\"    \"No; I must go.\"    \"And there is another thing,\" continued Hedwig: \"Gessler the Governor  is in the town now.\"    \"He goes away to-day.\"    \"Well, wait till he has gone. You must not meet him. He bears you  malice.\"    \"To me his malice cannot do much harm. I do what's right, and fear no  enemy.\"    \"Those who do right,\" said Hedwig, \"are those he hates the most. And  you know he has never forgiven you for speaking like that when you met  him in the ravine. Keep away from the town for to-day. Do anything  else. Go hunting, if you will.\"    \"No,\" said Tell; \"I promised. I must go. Come along, Walter.\"    \"You _aren't_ going to take that poor _dear_ child? Come  here, Walter, directly minute!'    \"Want to go with father,\" said Walter, beginning to cry, for his father  had promised to take him with him the next time he went to the town,  and he had saved his pocket-money for the occasion.    \"Oh, let the boy come,\" said Tell. \"William will stay with you, won't  you, William?\"    \"All right, father,\" said William.    \"Well, mark my words,\" said Hedwig, \"if something bad does not happen I  shall be surprised.\"    \"Oh no,\" said Tell. \"What can happen?\"    And without further delay he set off with Walter for the town.          CHAPTER VI      In the meantime all kinds of things of which Tell had no suspicion had  been happening in the town. The fact that there were no newspapers in  Switzerland at that time often made him a little behindhand as regarded  the latest events. He had to depend, as a rule, on visits from his  friends, who would sit in his kitchen and tell him all about everything  that had been going on for the last few days. And, of course, when  there was anything very exciting happening in the town, nobody had time  to trudge up the hill to Tell's chalet. They all wanted to be in the  town enjoying the fun.    What had happened now was this. It was the chief amusement of the  Governor, Gessler (who, you will remember, was _not_ a nice man),  when he had a few moments to spare from the cares of governing, to sit  down and think out some new way of annoying the Swiss people. He was  one of those persons who                \"only do it to annoy,       Because they know it teases.\"    What he liked chiefly was to forbid something. He would find out what  the people most enjoyed doing, and then he would send a herald to say  that he was very sorry, but it must stop. He found that this annoyed  the Swiss more than anything. But now he was rather puzzled what to do,  for he had forbidden everything he could think of. He had forbidden  dancing and singing, and playing on any sort of musical instrument, on  the ground that these things made such a noise, and disturbed people  who wanted to work. He had forbidden the eating of everything"]]]
