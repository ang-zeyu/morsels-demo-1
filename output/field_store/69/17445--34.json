In the event of anything happening to an agent who leaves a family or  other relatives, the money is handed over to them.\"    I later cursed that rule, for when I was captured in England there  were 30,000 marks ($7,500) due me at the Wilhelmstrasse and I can  whistle for it now.    Captain von Tappken looked at me inquiringly, but I hesitated.  It was  not on account of monetary causes, but for peculiarly private  reasons--the dilemma of one of our house becoming a spy.  The Captain,  unaware of the personal equation that was obsessing me before giving  my word, evidently thought that his financial inducements were not  alluring enough.    \"Of course,\" he continued, \"this scale of pay is only the beginning.  As your use to us and the importance of your missions increases, so  will your remuneration.  That depends entirely on you.\"    He raised his eyebrows inquiringly.    \"Very well,\" I said.  \"I accept.\"    He held out his hand.  \"You made up your mind quickly.\"    \"It is my way, Captain.  I take a thing or leave it.\"    \"That's what I like, Doctor; a quick, decisive mind.\"    That seemed to please him.    \"Very well.  To be of use to us, you w ill need a lot of technical  coaching.  Are you ready to start tomorrow?\"    \"Now, Captain.\"    \"Very good,\" he said, \"but to-morrow will do.  Be here at ten A. M.  Then give us daily as much of your time as we require.\"    He called in one of his secretaries, gave him command briefly and in a  few minutes the man was back with an order for three hundred marks.    \"This, Doctor, is your first month's living expenses.  Retaining fees  are paid quarterly.\"    As I pocketed the check I remarked:    \"Captain, personally we are total strangers.  How is it that you seem  so satisfied with me?\"    Again his peculiar smile was noticeable.    \"That is outside our usual business procedure,\" he said.  \"I have my  instructions from above and I simply act on them.\"    I was young then, and curious so I asked:    \"Who are those above and what are their instructions?\"    No sooner had I put that question than I learned my first lesson in  the Secret Service.  All traces of genial friendliness vanished from  von Tappken's face.  It was stern and serious.    \"My boy,\" he said slowly, \"learn this from the start and learn it  well.  Do not ask questions.  Do not talk.  Think!  You will soon  learn that there are many unwritten laws attached to this Service.\"    I never forgot that.  It was my first lesson in Secret Service.      Chapter II. The Making of a Secret Agent    The average man or woman has only a hazy idea what European Secret  Service and Espionage really means and accomplishes.  Short stories  and novels, written in a background of diplomacy and secret agents,  have given the public vague impressions about the world of spies.  But  this is the first real unvarnished account of the system; the class of  men and women employed; the means used to obtain the desired results  and the risks run by those connected with this service.  Since the  days of Moses who employed spies in Canaan, to Napoleon Bonaparte, who  inaugurated the first thorough system of political espionage,  potentates, powerful ministers and heads of departments have found it  necessary to obtain early and correct information other than through  the usual official channels.  To gain this knowledge they have to  employ persons unknown and unrecognized in official circles.  A  recognized official such as an ambassador or a secretary of legation,  envoys plenipotentiary and consuls, would not be able to gain the  information sought, as naturally everybody is on their guard against  them.  Moreover, official etiquette prevents an ambassador or consul  from acting in such a capacity.    In this age of rapid developments the need of quick and accurate  information is even more pressing.  Europe to-day is a sort of armed  camp, composed of a number of nations of fairly equal strength, in  which the units are more or less afraid of each other.  Mutual  distrust and conflicting interests compel Germany, England, France and  Russia to spend billions of money each year on armaments.  Germany  builds one battleship; England lays down two; France adds ten  battalions to her army; Germany adds twenty.  So the relative strength  keeps on a fair level.  But with rapid constructions, new inventions  of weapons, armor, aerial craft, this apparent equality is constantly  disturbed.  Here also enters the personal policy and ambitions and pet  schemes of the individual heads of nations and their cabinets.  Because there is a constant fear of being outdistanced, every  government in Europe is trying its utmost to get ahead of the other.  They, hence, keep a stringent watch on each other's movements.  This  is possible only by an efficient system of espionage, by trained men  and women, willing to run the risks attached to this sort of work.    For risks there are.  I have been imprisoned twice, once in the  Balkans at Belgrade, once in England.  I have been attacked five times  and bear the marks of the wounds to this day.  Escapes I have had by  the dozen.  All my missions were not successes, more often, failures,  and the failures are often fatal.  For instance:    Early in the morning of June 11, 1903, the plot which had been brewing  in Servia ended with the assassination of the king, queen, ministers  and members of the royal household of Servia.  I shall not go into the  undercurrent political significance of these atrocities as I had no  active part in them, but I was sent down by my government later to  ascertain as far as possible the prime movers in the intrigue which  pointed to Colonel Mashin and a gang of officers of the Sixth  Regiment.  All these regicides received Russian pay, for King  Alexander had become dangerous to Russia, because of his flirting with  Austria.  Besides, his own idiotic behavior and the flagrant  indiscretions of Queen Draga had by no means endeared him to his  people.    I stuck my nose into a regular hornets' nest and soon found myself in  a most dangerous position.  I was arrested by the provisional  government on the order of Lieutenant Colonel Niglitsch on a most  flimsy charge of traveling with false passports.  In those times  arrests and executions were the order of the day.  The old Servian  proverb of \"Od Roba Ikad Iz Groba Nikad\" (Out of prison, yes; out of  the grave, never) was fully acted upon.  There were really no  incriminating papers of any description upon me, but my being seen and  associating with persons opposed to the provisional government was  quite enough to place me before a drumhead court-martial.    I was sitting in the CafÃ© Petit Parisien with Lieutenant Nikolevitch  and Mons Krastov, a merchant of Belgrade, when a file of soldiers in  charge of an officer pulled us out of our chairs and without any  further ado marched us to the Citadel.  The next morning we were taken  separately into a small room where three men in the uniform of  colonels were seated at a small iron table.  No questions were asked.    \"You are found guilty of associating with revolutionary persons.  You  were found possessing a passport not your own.  You are sentenced to  be shot at sundown.\"    The whole thing appeared to me first as a joke, then as a bluff, but  looking closely into those high-cheekboned, narrow-eyed faces with the  characteristically close-cropped brutal heads, the humorous aspect  dwindled rapidly and I thought it about time to make a counter move.  Without betraying any of my inward qualms--and believe me, I began to  have some--I said quietly:    \"I think you will find it advisable to inform M. Zolarevitch\" (then  minister of War) \"that Count Weringrode sends his regards.\"    I saw them looking rather curiously at each other and then the center  inquisitor fired a lot of questions at me, in answer to which I only  shrugged my shoulders.    \"That's all I have to say, monsieur.\"    I was shoved back in my cell.  About four that afternoon one of the  officers came to see me.    \"Your message has not been sent.  My comrades were against sending it,  but I am related to Zolarevitch.  So if you can show me some reason, I  shall take your message.\"    I gave him some reason.  So much so that he did not lose any time  getting under way.  In fact, it was a very pale, perturbed officer who  rushed out of my cell.  I didn't worry much, but when at about 7.30  the cell door opened and two sentries with fixed bayonets and  cartridge pouches entered, placed me in the center and marched me into  the courtyard, where ten more likewise equipped soldiers in charge of  an officer awaited me, I felt somewhat green.  I know a firing squad  when I see one.  I knew if my message ever reached responsible  quarters, nothing could happen to me; but these were motley times and  all sorts of delays may have happened to the officer.    \"Right about wheel\" and myself in the center, we marched out of the  courtyard to a little hill to the west of the Citadel.    An old stone building--probably a decayed monastery, for I noticed  several crumbled tombstones--was evidently selected for the place of  execution.  On a little rough, four-foot, stone wall we halted, and  the officer, pulling out a document, began reading to me a rather  lengthy preamble in Servian.    Up to then not a word had been spoken.  I let him finish and then  politely requested him, as I was not a Serb and consequently did not  understand his lingo, to translate it into a civilized language,  preferably German or French.  He seemed somewhat startled and gave me  to understand that he was led to believe I was a Serb.  I used some  very forcible German and French, both of which he was able to  understand, pointing out to him that someone, somewhere, made a  thundering big blunder which somehow would have to be paid for.  He  was clearly ill at ease, but said, \"I have to obey my instructions.\"  I had told him of my message to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6952"],[0,"By Pike and Dyke: a Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic (#3)"],[1,"in the Low  Country. By the way, you were talking of the beggars of the sea.  Their fleet is lying at present at Dover, and it is said that the  Spanish ambassador is making grave complaints to the queen on the  part of his master against giving shelter to these men, whom he  brands as not only enemies of Spain, but as pirates and robbers of  the sea.\"    \"I was talking with Master Sheepshanks,\" another mariner put in,  \"whose ships I sailed for thirty years, and who is an alderman and  knows what is going on, and he told me that from what he hears it  is like enough that the queen will yield to the Spanish request. So  long as she chooses to remain friends with Spain openly, whatever  her thoughts and opinions may be, she can scarcely allow her ports  to be used by the enemies of Philip. It must go sorely against  her high spirit; but till she and her council resolve that England  shall brave the whole strength of Spain, she cannot disregard the  remonstrances of Philip. It is a bad business, neighbours, a bad  business; and the sooner it comes to an end the better. No one  doubts that we shall have to fight Spain one of these days, and  I say that it were better to fight while our brethren of the Low  Countries can fight by our side, than to wait till Spain, having  exterminated them, can turn her whole power against us.\"    There was a general chorus of assent, and then the subject changed  to the rates of freight to the northern ports. The grievous need for  the better marking of shallows and dangers, the rights of seamen,  wages, and other matters, were discussed until the assembly broke  up. Ned's sisters joined him in the garden.    \"I hear, Constance,\" the boy said to the elder, \"there has been no  news from our grandfather and uncles since we have been away.\"    \"No word whatever, Ned. Our mother does not say much, but I know  she is greatly troubled and anxious about it.\"    \"That she may well be, Constance, seeing that neither quiet conduct  nor feebleness nor aught else avail to protect any from the rage  of the Spaniards. You who stay at home here only hear general tales  of the cruelties done across the sea, but if you heard the tales  that we do at their ports they would drive you almost to madness.  Not that we hear much, for we have to keep on board our ships, and  may not land or mingle with the people; but we learn enough from  the merchants who come on board to see about the landing of their  goods to make our blood boil. They do right to prevent our landing;  for so fired is the sailors' blood by these tales of massacre, that  were they to go ashore they would, I am sure, be speedily embroiled  with the Spaniards.    \"You see how angered these friends of our father are who are  Englishmen, and have no Dutch blood in their veins, and who feel  only because they are touched by these cruelties, and because  the people of the Low Country are Protestants; but with us it is  different, our mother is one of these persecuted people, and we  belong to them as much as to England. We have friends and relations  there who are in sore peril, and who may for aught we know have  already fallen victims to the cruelty of the Spaniards. Had I  my will I would join the beggars of the sea, or I would ship with  Drake or Cavendish and fight the Spaniards in the Indian seas. They  say that there Englishmen are proving themselves better men than  these haughty dons.\"    \"It is very sad,\" Constance said; \"but what can be done?\"    \"Something must be done soon,\" Ned replied gloomily. \"Things cannot  go on as they are. So terrible is the state of things, so heavy the  taxation, that in many towns all trade is suspended. In Brussels,  I hear, Alva's own capital, the brewers have refused to brew, the  bakers to bake, the tapsters to draw liquors. The city swarms with  multitudes of men thrown out of employment. The Spanish soldiers  themselves have long been without pay, for Alva thinks of nothing  but bloodshed. Consequently they are insolent to their officers, care  little for order, and insult and rob the citizens in the streets.  Assuredly something must come of this ere long; and the people's  despair will become a mad fury. If they rise, Constance, and my  father does not say nay, I will assuredly join them and do my best.    \"I do not believe that the queen will forbid her subjects to give  their aid to the people of the Netherlands; for she allowed many to  fight in France for Conde and the Protestants against the Guises,  and she will surely do the same now, since the sufferings of our  brothers in the Netherlands have touched the nation far more keenly  than did those of the Huguenots in France. I am sixteen now, and  my father says that in another year he will rate me as his second  mate, and methinks that there are not many men on board who can pull  more strongly a rope, or work more stoutly at the capstan when we  heave our anchor. Besides, as we all talk Dutch as well as English,  I should be of more use than men who know nought of the language  of the country.\"    Constance shook her head. \"I do not think, Ned, that our father  would give you leave, at any rate not until you have grown up into  a man. He looks to having you with him, and to your succeeding  him some day in the command of the Good Venture, while he remains  quietly at home with our mother.\"    Ned agreed with a sigh. \"I fear that you are right, Constance, and  that I shall have to stick to my trade of sailoring; but if the  people of the Netherlands rise against their tyrants, it would be  hard to be sailing backwards and forwards doing a peaceful trade  between London and Holland whilst our friends and relatives are  battling for their lives.\"    A fortnight later, the Good Venture filled up her hold with a cargo  for Brill, a port where the united Rhine, Waal, and Maas flow into  the sea. On the day before she sailed a proclamation was issued  by the queen forbidding any of her subjects to supply De la Marck  and his sailors with meat, bread, or beer. The passage down the  river was slow, for the winds were contrary, and it was ten days  afterwards, the 31st of March, when they entered the broad mouth  of the river and dropped anchor off the town of Brill. It was late  in the evening when they arrived. In the morning an officer came  off to demand the usual papers and documents, and it was not until  nearly two o'clock that a boat came out with the necessary permission  for the ship to warp up to the wharves and discharge her cargo.    Just as Captain Martin was giving the order for the capstan bars  to be manned, a fleet of some twenty-four ships suddenly appeared  round the seaward point of the land.    \"Wait a moment, lads,\" the captain said, \"half an hour will make no  great difference in our landing. We may as well wait and see what  is the meaning of this fleet. They do not look to me to be Spaniards,  nor seem to be a mere trading fleet. I should not wonder if they  are the beggars of the sea, who have been forced to leave Dover,  starved out from the effect of the queen's proclamation, and have  now come here to pick up any Spaniard they may meet sailing out.\"    The fleet dropped anchor at about half a mile from the town. Just  as they did so, a ferryman named Koppelstok, who was carrying  passengers across from the town of Maaslandluis, a town on the  opposite bank a mile and a half away, was passing close by the Good  Venture.    \"What think you of yon ships?\" the ferryman shouted to Captain  Martin.    \"I believe they must be the beggars of the sea,\" the captain replied.  \"An order had been issued before I left London that they were not  to be supplied with provisions, and they would therefore have had  to put out from Dover. This may well enough be them.\"    An exclamation of alarm broke from the passengers, for the sea  beggars were almost as much feared by their own countrymen as by the  Spaniards, the latter having spared no pains in spreading tales to  their disadvantage. As soon as the ferryman had landed his passengers  he rowed boldly out towards the fleet, having nothing of which he  could be plundered, and being secretly well disposed towards the  beggars. The first ship he hailed was that commanded by William  de Blois, Lord of Treslong, who was well known at Brill, where his  father had at one time been governor.    His brother had been executed by the Duke of Alva four years before,  and he had himself fought by the side of Count Louis of Nassau,  brother to the Prince of Orange, in the campaign that had terminated  so disastrously, and though covered with wounds had been one of  the few who had escaped from the terrible carnage that followed the  defeat at Jemmingen. After that disaster he had taken to the sea,  and was one of the most famous of the captains of De la Marck, who  had received a commission of admiral from the Prince of Orange.    \"We are starving, Koppelstok; can you inform us how we can get some  food? We have picked up two Spanish traders on our way here from  Dover, but our larders were emptied before we sailed, and we found  but scant supply on board our prizes.\"    \"There is plenty in the town of Brill,\" the ferryman said; \"but none  that I know of elsewhere. That English brig lying there at anchor  may have a few loaves on board.\"    \"That will not be much,\" William de Blois replied, \"among five  hundred men, still it will be better than nothing. Will you row  and ask them if they will sell to us?\"    \"You had best send a strongly armed crew,\" Koppelstok replied.  \"You know the English are well disposed towards us, and the captain  would doubtless give you all the provisions he had to spare; but to  do so would be to ruin him with the Spaniards, who might confiscate  his ship. It were best that you should make a show of force, so  that he could plead that he did but yield to necessity.\"    Accordingly a boat with ten men rowed to the brig, Koppelstok  accompanying it.
