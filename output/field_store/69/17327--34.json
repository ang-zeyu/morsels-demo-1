I.    NEW WITNESSES FOR THE TRUTH OF GOD'S WORD ASSURED.    It is a happy omen, that, while so much of the literature of our times  is marked by a tone of infidelity, and especially by a disparagement of  the evidences of the authenticity and inspiration of the Scriptures,  there is in other quarters an increasing readiness to make the choicest  gifts of modern science and learning tributary to the word of God.  The eclipse of faith is not total. And it is an additional cause for  gratitude to the God of Providence and of Revelation, that, even at  this remote distance of time from the date of the Sacred Oracles, new  evidences of their credibility and accuracy are continually coming  to light. How much may yet remain, buried under barren mounds, or  entombed in pyramids and catacombs, or hidden in the yet unexplored  pages of some ancient literature, it were vain to conjecture; but of  this we may be sure, that if any new forms of evidence should hereafter  be needed, to meet any new forms of unbelief, and authenticate afresh  the word of truth, they will be found deposited somewhere, waiting  for the fulness of time; and God will bring them forth in their  season, from the dark hieroglyphics, or the desert sands, or the dusty  manuscripts, to confound the adversaries of his word, and to \"magnify  it above all his name.\"--\"Historical Evidences of the Truth of the  Scripture Records,\" by George Rawlinson, M.

THE WORLD'S HUNGER FOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHRIST.    \"Were a parchment discovered in an Egyptian mound, six inches square,  containing fifty words which were certainly spoken by Jesus, this  utterance would count more than all the books which have been published  since the first century. If a veritable picture of the Lord could be  unearthed from a catacomb, and the world could see with its own eyes  what like he was, it would not matter that its colors were faded, and  that it was roughly drawn, that picture would have at once a solitary  place amid the treasures of art.\"--Rev.

THE BOOK OF MORMON A WITNESS FOR THE CHRIST.    \"And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity,  were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all other  nations. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that they did  prosper in the land; and I beheld a Book, and it was carried forth  among them. And the angel said unto me, Knowest thou the meaning of  the Book? And I said unto him, I know not. And he said. Behold it  proceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew; * * * * and he said unto me, The  Book that thou beholdest is a record of the Jews, which contains the  covenants of the Lord which he hath made with the House of Israel; and  it also containeth many of the prophecies of the holy Prophets. * *  * * And it came to pass that I beheld the remnant of the seed of my  brethren, and also the Book of the Lamb of God, which had proceeded  forth from the mouth of the Jew, that it came forth from the Gentiles,  unto the remnant of the seed of my brethren. And after it had come  forth unto them, I beheld other Books, which came forth by the power  of the Lamb, from the Gentiles, unto them, unto the convincing of  the Gentiles, and the remnant of the seed of my brethren, and also  the Jews, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth, that  the records of the Prophets and of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb  [the Bible] are true. And the angel spake unto me, saying. These last  records which thou hast seen among the Gentiles, shall establish the  truth of the first, which are of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, and  shall make known the plain and precious things which have been taken  away from them; and shall make known unto all kindreds, tongues and  people, that the Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father, and  the Savior of the world; and that all men must come unto him, or they  cannot be saved.\"--I.

NEW WITNESSES FOR GOD.    II.    THE BOOK OF MORMON.        CHAPTER I.    THE BIBLE IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY    \"The Bible in the Nineteenth Century\" will yet form an interesting  subject for a volume. The writer of it will recount the attacks  made upon the sacred volume by unbelievers, and the defense of it  by faithful Christian and Jewish scholars. He will also be under  the necessity of writing the history of the betrayals of the Holy  Scriptures by pretended friends; and he will say such betrayals were  more mischievous than the attacks of avowed enemies. He will balance  the harm done by the attacks and the betrayals, against the good  accomplished by the defenses, and give the net result of gain or loss.  Which will preponderate? The nineteenth century was prolific in both  assaults and defenses; and much valuable material was collected from  unexpected quarters for the defense of the Scriptures; but for all that  it is doubtful if in what is recognized as the Christian world the  faith of the Christians in the Bible, as the veritable word of God, was  as sound and absolute at the close of the nineteenth century as it was  at the commencement of it. This is not saying that what is regarded  as old fashioned faith in the Bible has been entirely banished, or  totally eclipsed. There are those, and many of them, thank God, who  still revere the Bible as the word of God, and therefore hold it  true, and take it as a lamp to their feet, as a guide to their path.  But there has arisen within Christendom itself--and chiefly within  the nineteenth century--a class of Bible scholars who have done much  mischief to faith in the Bible; who make it part of their boast that  in their study of the Bible they have dropped the theological attitude  towards it, viz., the preconception that the Bible is the word of God,  on which conception men were wont to reason: God is a God of absolute  truth; the Bible is the word of God; therefore the Bible is absolutely  true. This position they now abandon and take up what they are pleased  to call the \"literary attitude or method.\" That is, they approach the  Bible without any preconception whatsoever. They take up the collection  of books forming the Bible as they would take up any other body of  literature; as they would English, French, or German literature. \"This  method,\" says one high in authority in the new school of critics,  \"assumes nothing. It leaves the conclusion of the questions whether the  Bible came from God, in what sense it came from God, how far and to  what extent it came from God, all to be determined by examination of  the book itself. This I call the literary method.\" [1] \"This method,\"  says another, \"leads to the investigation of the origin, authorship,  and meaning of the several books of the Bible, and the credibility of  the history which it contains.\" [2] Concerning in what those of the  Literary school are agreed, and in what their method results, as to the  Old Testament, I quote the following:        They are generally agreed in thinking that the book of Genesis is      composed of three or four or more documents woven together by some      ancient editor in one continuous narrative. They are generally      agreed in thinking that the book of the Covenant, [3] with the Ten      Commandments at its forefront, is the oldest book in the Bible;      that the history in which that book of the Covenant is embedded was      written long subsequent to the time of Moses. They are generally      agreed in thinking that the Book of Deuteronomy, embodying a later      prophet's conception of Mosaic principles, was not written or      uttered by Moses himself in its present form, but some centuries      after the death of Moses. They are generally agreed in thinking      that the book of Leviticus was written long subsequent to the time      of Moses, and so far from embodying the principles of the Mosaic      code embodies much that is in spirit adverse if not antagonistic      to the simple principles of Mosaism. They are generally agreed      in considering that we have in the books of Kings and Chronicles      history and belles lettres so woven together that it is not always      possible to tell what is to be regarded as belles lettres and what      is to be regarded as history.

In the following pages it is proposed to discuss the place in  history  of the \"law of Moses;\" more precisely, the question to be  considered is whether that law is the starting-point for the  history of ancient Israel, or not rather for that of Judaism, ie.,  of the religious communion which survived the destruction of the  nation by the Assyrians and Chaldaeans.    I. It is an opinion very extensively held that the great mass of  the books of the Old Testament not only relate to the pre-exilic  period, but date from it.  According to this view, they are  remnants of the literature of ancient Israel which the Jews rescued  as a heritage from the past, and on which they continued to  subsist in the decay of independent intellectual life.  In  dogmatic theology Judaism is a mere empty chasm over which one  springs from the Old Testament to the New; and even where this  estimate is modified, the belief still prevails in a general way  that the Judaism which received the books of Scripture into the  canon had, as a rule, nothing to do with their production.  But the  exceptions to this principle which are conceded as regards the  second and third divisions of the Hebrew canon cannot be called so  very slight.  Of the Hagiograpba, by far the larger portion is  demonstrably post-exilic, and no part demonstrably older than  the exile.  Daniel comes as far down as the Maccabaean wars, and  Esther is perhaps even later.  Of the prophetical literature a very  appreciable fraction is later than the fall of the Hebrew kingdom;  and the associated historical books (the \"earlier prophets\" of the  Hebrew canon) date, in the form in which we now possess them, from  a period subsequent to the death of Jeconiah, who must have  survived the year 560 B.C. for some time.  Making all allowance  for the older sources utilised, and to a large extent transcribed  word for word, in Judges, Samuel, and Kings, we find that apart  from the Pentateuch the preexilic portion of the Old Testament  amounts in bulk to little more than the half of the entire volume.  All the rest belongs to the later period, and it includes not  merely the feeble after-growths of a failing vegetation, but also  productions of the vigour and originality of Isa. xl.lxvi. and  Ps.Ixxiii.    We come then to the Law.  Here, as for most parts of the Old  Testament, we have no express information as to the author and date  of composition, and to get even approximately at the truth we are  shut up to the use of such data as can be derived from an analysis  of the contents, taken in conjunction with what we may happen to  know from other sources as to the course of Israel's history.  But  the habit has been to assume that the historical period to be  considered in this connection ends with the Babylonian exile as  certainly as it begins with the exodus from Egypt.  At first sight  this assumption seems to be justified by the history of the  canon; it was the Law that first became canonical through the  influence of Ezra and Nehemiah; the Prophets became so  considerably later, and the Hagiographa last of all.  Now it is  not unnatural, from the chronological order in which these writings  were received into the canon, to proceed to an inference as to  their approximate relative age, and so not only to place the  Prophets before the Hagiographa, but also the five books of Moses  before the Prophets.  If the Prophets are for the most part older  than the exile, how much more so the Law!  But however trustworthy  such a mode of comparison may be when applied to the middle as  contrasted with the latest portion of the canon, it is not at all  to be relied on when the first part is contrasted with the other  two.  The very idea of canonicity  was originally associated with  the Torah, and was only afterwards extended to the other books,  which slowly and by a gradual process acquired a certain measure  of the validity given to the Torah by a single public and formal  act, through which it was introduced at once as the Magna Charta of  the Jewish communion (Nehemiah viii.-x.)  In their case the canonical--  that is, legal--character was not intrinsic, but was only  subsequently acquired; there must therefore have been some  interval, and there may have been a very long one, between the  date of their origin and that of their receiving public sanction.  To the Law, on the other hand, the canonical character is much more  essential, and serious difficulties beset the assumption that the  Law of Moses came into existence at a period long before the exile,  aml did not attain the force of law until many centuries  afterwards, and in totally different circumstances from those  under which it had arisen.  At least the fact that a collection  claiming public recognition as an ecclesiastical book should have  attained such recognition earlier than other writings which make no  such claim is no proof of superior antiquity.    We cannot, then, peremptorily refuse to regard it as possible  that what was the law of Judaism may also have been its product;  and there are urgent reasons for taking the suggestion into very  careful consideration.  It may not be out of place here to refer  to personal experience.  In my early student days I was attracted  by the stories of Saul and David, Ahab and Elijah; the discourses  of Amos and Isaiah laid strong hold on me, and I read myself well  into the prophetic and historical books of the Old Testament.  Thanks to such aids as were accessible to me, I even considered  that I understood them tolerably, but at the same time was troubled  with a bad conscience, as if I were beginning with the roof instead  of the foundation; for I had no thorough acquaintance with the  Law, of which I was accustomed to be told that it was the basis and  postulate of the whole literature.  At last I took courage and made  my way through Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and even through  Knobel's Commentary to these books.  But it was in vain that I  looked for the light which was to be shed from this source on the  historical and prophetical books.  On the contrary, my enjoyment  of the latter was marred by  the Law; it did not bring them any  nearer me, but intruded itself uneasily, like a ghost that makes a  noise indeed, but is not visible and really effects nothing.  Even  where there were points of contact between it and them, differences  also made themselves felt, and I found it impossible to give a  candid decision in favour of the priority of the Law.  Dimly I  began to perceive that throughout there was between them all the  difference that separates two wholly distinct worlds.  Yet, so far  from attaining clear conceptions, I only fell into deeper  confusion, which was worse confounded by the explanations of Ewald  in the second volume of history of Israel.  At last, in the course  of a casual visit in Gottingen in the summer of 1867, I learned  through Ritschl that Karl Heinrich Graf placed the law later than  the Prophets, and, almost without knowing his reasons for the  hypothesis, I was prepared to accept it; I readily acknowledged  to myself thc possibility of understanding Hebrew antiquity  without the book of the Torah.    The hypothesis usually associated with Graf's name is really not  his, but-that of his teacher, Eduard Reuss.  It would be still  more correct to call it after Leopold Gcorge and Wiihelm Vatke,  who, independent alike of Reuss and of each other, were the first  to give it literary currency.  All three, again, are disciples of  Martin Lebrecht de Wette, the epochmaking pioneer of historical  criticism in this field./1/     *******************************  1. M. W.
