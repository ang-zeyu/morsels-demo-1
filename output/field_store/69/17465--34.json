With us _half_ a dollar buys more than a _dollar_ buys  with you--and THEREFORE it stands to reason and the commonest  kind of common-sense, that our wages are _higher_ than yours.\"    He looked dazed, and said, despairingly:    \"Verily, I cannot make it out.  Ye've just said ours are the  higher, and with the same breath ye take it back.\"    \"Oh, great Scott, isn't it possible to get such a simple thing  through your head?  Now look here--let me illustrate.  We pay  four cents for a woman's stuff gown, you pay 8.4.0, which is  four mills more than _double_.  What do you allow a laboring  woman who works on a farm?\"    \"Two mills a day.\"    \"Very good; we allow but half as much; we pay her only a tenth  of a cent a day; and--\"    \"Again ye're conf--\"    \"Wait!  Now, you see, the thing is very simple; this time you'll  understand it.  For instance, it takes your woman 42 days to earn  her gown, at 2 mills a day--7 weeks' work; but ours earns hers  in forty days--two days _short_ of 7 weeks.  Your woman has a gown,  and her whole seven weeks wages are gone; ours has a gown, and  two days' wages left, to buy something else with.  There--_now_  you understand it!\"    He looked--well, he merely looked dubious, it's the most I can say;  so did the others.  I waited--to let the thing work.  Dowley spoke  at last--and betrayed the fact that he actually hadn't gotten away  from his rooted and grounded superstitions yet.  He said, with  a trifle of hesitancy:    \"But--but--ye cannot fail to grant that two mills a day is better  than one.\"    Shucks!  Well, of course, I hated to give it up.  So I chanced  another flyer:    \"Let us suppose a case.  Suppose one of your journeymen goes out  and buys the following articles:      \"1 pound of salt;     1 dozen eggs;     1 dozen pints of beer;     1 bushel of wheat;     1 tow-linen suit;     5 pounds of beef;     5 pounds of mutton.    \"The lot will cost him 32 cents.  It takes him 32 working days  to earn the money--5 weeks and 2 days.  Let him come to us and  work 32 days at _half_ the wages; he can buy all those things for  a shade under 14 1/2 cents; they will cost him a shade under 29  days' work, and he will have about half a week's wages over.  Carry  it through the year; he would save nearly a week's wages every  two months, _your_ man nothing; thus saving five or six weeks' wages  in a year, your man not a cent.  _Now_ I reckon you understand that  'high wages' and 'low wages' are phrases that don't mean anything  in the world until you find out which of them will _buy_ the most!\"    It was a crusher.    But, alas! it didn't crush.  No, I had to give it up.  What those  people valued was _high wages_; it didn't seem to be a matter of  any consequence to them whether the high wages would buy anything  or not.  They stood for \"protection,\" and swore by it, which was  reasonable enough, because interested parties had gulled them into  the notion that it was protection which had created their high  wages.  I proved to them that in a quarter of a century their wages  had advanced but 30 per cent., while the cost of living had gone  up 100; and that with us, in a shorter time, wages had advanced  40 per cent. while the cost of living had gone steadily down.  But  it didn't do any good.  Nothing could unseat their strange beliefs.    Well, I was smarting under a sense of defeat.  Undeserved defeat,  but what of that?  That didn't soften the smart any.  And to think  of the circumstances! the first statesman of the age, the capablest  man, the best-informed man in the entire world, the loftiest  uncrowned head that had moved through the clouds of any political  firmament for centuries, sitting here apparently defeated in  argument by an ignorant country blacksmith!  And I could see that  those others were sorry for me--which made me blush till I could  smell my whiskers scorching.  Put yourself in my place; feel as mean  as I did, as ashamed as I felt--wouldn't _you_ have struck below the  belt to get even?  Yes, you would; it is simply human nature.  Well, that is what I did.  I am not trying to justify it; I'm only  saying that I was mad, and _anybody_ would have done it.    Well, when I make up my mind to hit a man, I don't plan out  a love-tap; no, that isn't my way; as long as I'm going to hit him  at all, I'm going to hit him a lifter.  And I don't jump at him  all of a sudden, and risk making a blundering half-way business  of it; no, I get away off yonder to one side, and work up on him  gradually, so that he never suspects that I'm going to hit him  at all; and by and by, all in a flash, he's flat on his back, and  he can't tell for the life of him how it all happened.  That is  the way I went for brother Dowley.  I started to talking lazy and  comfortable, as if I was just talking to pass the time; and the  oldest man in the world couldn't have taken the bearings of my  starting place and guessed where I was going to fetch up:    \"Boys, there's a good many curious things about law, and custom,  and usage, and all that sort of thing, when you come to look at it;  yes, and about the drift and progress of human opinion and movement,  too.  There are written laws--they perish; but there are also  unwritten laws--_they_ are eternal.  Take the unwritten law of wages:  it says they've got to advance, little by little, straight through  the centuries.  And notice how it works.  We know what wages are  now, here and there and yonder; we strike an average, and say that's  the wages of to-day.  We know what the wages were a hundred years  ago, and what they were two hundred years ago; that's as far back  as we can get, but it suffices to give us the law of progress,  the measure and rate of the periodical augmentation; and so, without  a document to help us, we can come pretty close to determining  what the wages were three and four and five hundred years ago.  Good, so far.  Do we stop there?  No.  We stop looking backward;  we face around and apply the law to the future.  My friends, I can  tell you what people's wages are going to be at any date in the  future you want to know, for hundreds and hundreds of years.\"    \"What, goodman, what!\"    \"Yes.  In seven hundred years wages will have risen to six times  what they are now, here in your region, and farm hands will be  allowed 3 cents a day, and mechanics 6.\"    \"I would't I might die now and live then!\" interrupted Smug, the  wheelwright, with a fine avaricious glow in his eye.    \"And that isn't all; they'll get their board besides--such as it is:  it won't bloat them.  Two hundred and fifty years later--pay attention  now--a mechanic's wages will be--mind you, this is law, not  guesswork; a mechanic's wages will then be _twenty_ cents a day!\"    There was a general gasp of awed astonishment, Dickon the mason  murmured, with raised eyes and hands:    \"More than three weeks' pay for one day's work!\"    \"Riches!--of a truth, yes, riches!\" muttered Marco, his breath  coming quick and short, with excitement.    \"Wages will keep on rising, little by little, little by little,  as steadily as a tree grows, and at the end of three hundred and  forty years more there'll be at least _one_ country where the  mechanic's average wage will be _two hundred_ cents a day!\"    It knocked them absolutely dumb!  Not a man of them could get  his breath for upwards of two minutes.  Then the coal-burner  said prayerfully:    \"Might I but live to see it!\"    \"It is the income of an earl!\" said Smug.    \"An earl, say ye?\" said Dowley; \"ye could say more than that and  speak no lie; there's no earl in the realm of Bagdemagus that hath  an income like to that.  Income of an earl--mf! it's the income  of an angel!\"    \"Now, then, that is what is going to happen as regards wages.  In that remote day, that man will earn, with _one_ week's work,  that bill of goods which it takes you upwards of _fifty_ weeks to  earn now.  Some other pretty surprising things are going to happen,  too.  Brother Dowley, who is it that determines, every spring,  what the particular wage of each kind of mechanic, laborer, and  servant shall be for that year?\"    \"Sometimes the courts, sometimes the town council; but most of all,  the magistrate.  Ye may say, in general terms, it is the magistrate  that fixes the wages.\"    \"Doesn't ask any of those poor devils to _help_ him fix their wages  for them, does he?\"    \"Hm!  That _were_ an idea!  The master that's to pay him the money  is the one that's rightly concerned in that matter, ye will notice.\"    \"Yes--but I thought the other man might have some little trifle  at stake in it, too; and even his wife and children, poor creatures.  The masters are these: nobles, rich men, the prosperous generally.  These few, who do no work, determine what pay the vast hive shall  have who _do_ work.  You see?  They're a 'combine'--a trade union,  to coin a new phrase--who band themselves together to force their  lowly brother to take what they choose to give.  Thirteen hundred  years hence--so says the unwritten law--the 'combine' will be the  other way, and then how these fine people's posterity will fume  and fret and grit their teeth over the insolent tyranny of trade  unions!  Yes, indeed! the magistrate will tranquilly arrange the  wages from now clear away down into the nineteenth century; and  then all of a sudden the wage-earner will consider that a couple  of thousand years or so is enough of this one-sided sort of thing;  and he will rise up and take a hand in fixing his wages himself.  Ah, he will have a long and bitter account of wrong and humiliation  to settle.\"    \"Do ye believe--\"    \"That he actually will help to fix his own wages?  Yes, indeed.  And he will be strong and able, then.\"    \"Brave times, brave times, of a truth!\" sneered the prosperous smith.    \"Oh,--and there's another detail.  In that day, a master may hire  a man for only just one day, or one week,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7249"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 8. (#3)"],[1,"hanging?  Go to!\"    \"Go to\" was their way of saying \"I should smile!\" or \"I like that!\"  Queer talkers, those people.    Well, there was a sort of bastard justice in his view of the case,  and so I dropped the matter.  When you can't cure a disaster by  argument, what is the use to argue?  It isn't my way.  So I only said:    \"You're not going to be hanged.  None of us are.\"    Both men laughed, and the slave said:    \"Ye have not ranked as a fool--before.  You might better keep  your reputation, seeing the strain would not be for long.\"    \"It will stand it, I reckon.  Before to-morrow we shall be out  of prison, and free to go where we will, besides.\"    The witty officer lifted at his left ear with his thumb, made  a rasping noise in his throat, and said:    \"Out of prison--yes--ye say true.  And free likewise to go where  ye will, so ye wander not out of his grace the Devil's sultry realm.\"    I kept my temper, and said, indifferently:    \"Now I suppose you really think we are going to hang within  a day or two.\"    \"I thought it not many minutes ago, for so the thing was decided  and proclaimed.\"    \"Ah, then you've changed your mind, is that it?\"    \"Even that.  I only _thought_, then; I _know_, now.\"    I felt sarcastical, so I said:    \"Oh, sapient servant of the law, condescend to tell us, then,  what you _know_.\"    \"That ye will all be hanged _to-day_, at mid-afternoon!  Oho! that  shot hit home!  Lean upon me.\"    The fact is I did need to lean upon somebody.  My knights couldn't  arrive in time.  They would be as much as three hours too late.  Nothing in the world could save the King of England; nor me, which  was more important.  More important, not merely to me, but to  the nation--the only nation on earth standing ready to blossom  into civilization.  I was sick.  I said no more, there wasn't  anything to say.  I knew what the man meant; that if the missing  slave was found, the postponement would be revoked, the execution  take place to-day.  Well, the missing slave was found.        CHAPTER XXXVIII    SIR LAUNCELOT AND KNIGHTS TO THE RESCUE    Nearing four in the afternoon.  The scene was just outside the  walls of London.  A cool, comfortable, superb day, with a brilliant  sun; the kind of day to make one want to live, not die.  The  multitude was prodigious and far-reaching; and yet we fifteen  poor devils hadn't a friend in it.  There was something painful  in that thought, look at it how you might.  There we sat, on our  tall scaffold, the butt of the hate and mockery of all those  enemies.  We were being made a holiday spectacle.  They had built  a sort of grand stand for the nobility and gentry, and these were  there in full force, with their ladies.  We recognized a good  many of them.    The crowd got a brief and unexpected dash of diversion out of  the king.  The moment we were freed of our bonds he sprang up,  in his fantastic rags, with face bruised out of all recognition, and  proclaimed himself Arthur, King of Britain, and denounced the  awful penalties of treason upon every soul there present if hair  of his sacred head were touched.  It startled and surprised him  to hear them break into a vast roar of laughter.  It wounded his  dignity, and he locked himself up in silence.  Then, although  the crowd begged him to go on, and tried to provoke him to it  by catcalls, jeers, and shouts of:    \"Let him speak!  The king!  The king! his humble subjects hunger  and thirst for words of wisdom out of the mouth of their master  his Serene and Sacred Raggedness!\"    But it went for nothing.  He put on all his majesty and sat under  this rain of contempt and insult unmoved.  He certainly was great  in his way.  Absently, I had taken off my white bandage and wound  it about my right arm.  When the crowd noticed this, they began  upon me.  They said:    \"Doubtless this sailor-man is his minister--observe his costly  badge of office!\"    I let them go on until they got tired, and then I said:    \"Yes, I am his minister, The Boss; and to-morrow you will hear  that from Camelot which--\"    I got no further.  They drowned me out with joyous derision.  But  presently there was silence; for the sheriffs of London, in their  official robes, with their subordinates, began to make a stir which  indicated that business was about to begin.  In the hush which  followed, our crime was recited, the death warrant read, then  everybody uncovered while a priest uttered a prayer.    Then a slave was blindfolded; the hangman unslung his rope.  There  lay the smooth road below us, we upon one side of it, the banked  multitude wailing its other side--a good clear road, and kept free  by the police--how good it would be to see my five hundred horsemen  come tearing down it!  But no, it was out of the possibilities.  I followed its receding thread out into the distance--not a horseman  on it, or sign of one.    There was a jerk, and the slave hung dangling; dangling and hideously  squirming, for his limbs were not tied.    A second rope was unslung, in a moment another slave was dangling.    In a minute a third slave was struggling in the air.  It was  dreadful.  I turned away my head a moment, and when I turned back  I missed the king!  They were blindfolding him!  I was paralyzed;  I couldn't move, I was choking, my tongue was petrified.  They  finished blindfolding him, they led him under the rope.  I couldn't  shake off that clinging impotence.  But when I saw them put the  noose around his neck, then everything let go in me and I made  a spring to the rescue--and as I made it I shot one more glance  abroad--by George! here they came, a-tilting!--five hundred mailed  and belted knights on bicycles!    The grandest sight that ever was seen.  Lord, how the plumes  streamed, how the sun flamed and flashed from the endless procession  of webby wheels!    I waved my right arm as Launcelot swept in--he recognized my rag  --I tore away noose and bandage, and shouted:    \"On your knees, every rascal of you, and salute the king!  Who  fails shall sup in hell to-night!\"    I always use that high style when I'm climaxing an effect.  Well,  it was noble to see Launcelot and the boys swarm up onto that  scaffold and heave sheriffs and such overboard.  And it was fine  to see that astonished multitude go down on their knees and beg  their lives of the king they had just been deriding and insulting.  And as he stood apart there, receiving this homage in rags,  I thought to myself, well, really there is something peculiarly  grand about the gait and bearing of a king, after all.    I was immensely satisfied.  Take the whole situation all around,  it was one of the gaudiest effects I ever instigated.    And presently up comes Clarence, his own self! and winks, and  says, very modernly:    \"Good deal of a surprise, wasn't it?  I knew you'd like it.  I've  had the boys practicing this long time, privately; and just hungry  for a chance to show off.\"        CHAPTER XXXIX    THE YANKEE'S FIGHT WITH THE KNIGHTS    Home again, at Camelot.  A morning or two later I found the paper,  damp from the press, by my plate at the breakfast table.  I turned  to the advertising columns, knowing I should find something of  personal interest to me there.  It was this:                 DE PAR LE ROI.       Know that the great lord and illus-     trious Kni8ht, SIR SAGRAMOR LE     DESIROUS having condescended to     meet the King's Minister, Hank Mor-      gan, the which is surnamed The Boss,     for satisfgction of offence anciently given,     these wilL engage in the lists by     Camelot about the fourth hour of the     morning of the sixteenth day of this     next succeeding month. The battle     will be a l outrance, sith the said offence     was of a deadly sort, admitting of no     comPosition.                 DE PAR LE ROI      Clarence's editorial reference to this affair was to this effect:       It will be observed, by a gl7nce at our     advertising columns, that the commu-     nity is to be favored with a treat of un-     usual interest in the tournament line.     The n ames of the artists are warrant of     good enterTemment. The box-office     will be open at noon of the 13th; ad-     mission 3 cents, reserved seatsh 5; pro-     ceeds to go to the hospital fund  The     royal pair and all the Court will be pres-     ent. With these exceptions, and the     press and the clergy, the free list is strict-     ly susPended. Parties are hereby warn-     ed against buying tickets of speculators;     they will not be good at the door.     Everybody knows and likes The Boss,     everybody knows and likes Sir Sag.;     come, let us give the lads a good send-     off. ReMember, the proceeds go to a     great and free charity, and one whose     broad begevolence stretches out its help-     ing hand, warm with the blood of a lov-     ing heart, to all that suffer, regardless of     race, creed, condition or color--the     only charity yet established in the earth     which has no politico-religious stop-     cock on its compassion, but says Here     flows the stream, let ALL come and     drink! Turn out, all hands! fetch along     your dou3hnuts and your gum-drops     and have a good time. Pie for sale on     the grounds, and rocks to crack it with;     and ciRcus-lemonade--three drops of     lime juice to a barrel of water.     N.B. This is the first tournament     under the new law, whidh allow each     combatant to use any weapon he may pre-     fer. You may want to make a note of that.    Up to the day set, there was no talk in all Britain of anything  but this combat.  All other topics sank into insignificance and  passed out of men's thoughts and interest.  It was not because  a tournament was a great matter, it was not because Sir Sagramor  had found the Holy Grail, for he had not, but had failed; it was  not because the second (official) personage in the kingdom was  one of the duellists; no, all these features were commonplace.
