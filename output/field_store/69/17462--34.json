(#3)"],[1,"th--\"    \"That will do,\" I said; \"I reckon you are a patient.\"    I moved away, cogitating, and at the same time keeping an eye  out for any chance passenger in his right mind that might come  along and give me some light.  I judged I had found one, presently;  so I drew him aside and said in his ear:    \"If I could see the head keeper a minute--only just a minute--\"    \"Prithee do not let me.\"    \"Let you _what_?\"    \"_Hinder_ me, then, if the word please thee better.  Then he went  on to say he was an under-cook and could not stop to gossip,  though he would like it another time; for it would comfort his  very liver to know where I got my clothes.  As he started away he  pointed and said yonder was one who was idle enough for my purpose,  and was seeking me besides, no doubt.  This was an airy slim boy  in shrimp-colored tights that made him look like a forked carrot,  the rest of his gear was blue silk and dainty laces and ruffles;  and he had long yellow curls, and wore a plumed pink satin cap  tilted complacently over his ear.  By his look, he was good-natured;  by his gait, he was satisfied with himself.  He was pretty enough  to frame.  He arrived, looked me over with a smiling and impudent  curiosity; said he had come for me, and informed me that he was a page.    \"Go 'long,\" I said; \"you ain't more than a paragraph.\"    It was pretty severe, but I was nettled.  However, it never phazed  him; he didn't appear to know he was hurt.  He began to talk and  laugh, in happy, thoughtless, boyish fashion, as we walked along,  and made himself old friends with me at once; asked me all sorts  of questions about myself and about my clothes, but never waited  for an answer--always chattered straight ahead, as if he didn't  know he had asked a question and wasn't expecting any reply, until  at last he happened to mention that he was born in the beginning  of the year 513.    It made the cold chills creep over me!  I stopped and said,  a little faintly:    \"Maybe I didn't hear you just right.  Say it again--and say it  slow.  What year was it?\"    \"513.\"    \"513!  You don't look it!  Come, my boy, I am a stranger and  friendless; be honest and honorable with me.  Are you in your  right mind?\"    He said he was.    \"Are these other people in their right minds?\"    He said they were.    \"And this isn't an asylum?  I mean, it isn't a place where they  cure crazy people?\"    He said it wasn't.    \"Well, then,\" I said, \"either I am a lunatic, or something just  as awful has happened.  Now tell me, honest and true, where am I?\"    \"IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT.\"    I waited a minute, to let that idea shudder its way home,  and then said:    \"And according to your notions, what year is it now?\"    \"528--nineteenth of June.\"    I felt a mournful sinking at the heart, and muttered: \"I shall  never see my friends again--never, never again.  They will not  be born for more than thirteen hundred years yet.\"    I seemed to believe the boy, I didn't know why.  _Something_ in me  seemed to believe him--my consciousness, as you may say; but my  reason didn't.  My reason straightway began to clamor; that was  natural.  I didn't know how to go about satisfying it, because  I knew that the testimony of men wouldn't serve--my reason would  say they were lunatics, and throw out their evidence.  But all  of a sudden I stumbled on the very thing, just by luck.  I knew  that the only total eclipse of the sun in the first half of the  sixth century occurred on the 21st of June, A.D. 528, O.S., and  began at 3 minutes after 12 noon.  I also knew that no total eclipse  of the sun was due in what to _me_ was the present year--i.e., 1879.  So, if I could keep my anxiety and curiosity from eating the heart  out of me for forty-eight hours, I should then find out for certain  whether this boy was telling me the truth or not.    Wherefore, being a practical Connecticut man, I now shoved this  whole problem clear out of my mind till its appointed day and hour  should come, in order that I might turn all my attention to the  circumstances of the present moment, and be alert and ready to  make the most out of them that could be made.  One thing at a time,  is my motto--and just play that thing for all it is worth, even  if it's only two pair and a jack.  I made up my mind to two things:  if it was still the nineteenth century and I was among lunatics  and couldn't get away, I would presently boss that asylum or know  the reason why; and if, on the other hand, it was really the sixth  century, all right, I didn't want any softer thing: I would boss  the whole country inside of three months; for I judged I would  have the start of the best-educated man in the kingdom by a matter  of thirteen hundred years and upward.  I'm not a man to waste  time after my mind's made up and there's work on hand; so I said  to the page:    \"Now, Clarence, my boy--if that might happen to be your name  --I'll get you to post me up a little if you don't mind.  What is  the name of that apparition that brought me here?\"    \"My master and thine?  That is the good knight and great lord  Sir Kay the Seneschal, foster brother to our liege the king.\"    \"Very good; go on, tell me everything.\"    He made a long story of it; but the part that had immediate interest  for me was this: He said I was Sir Kay's prisoner, and that  in the due course of custom I would be flung into a dungeon and  left there on scant commons until my friends ransomed me--unless  I chanced to rot, first.  I saw that the last chance had the best  show, but I didn't waste any bother about that; time was too  precious.  The page said, further, that dinner was about ended  in the great hall by this time, and that as soon as the sociability  and the heavy drinking should begin, Sir Kay would have me in and  exhibit me before King Arthur and his illustrious knights seated at  the Table Round, and would brag about his exploit in capturing  me, and would probably exaggerate the facts a little, but it  wouldn't be good form for me to correct him, and not over safe,  either; and when I was done being exhibited, then ho for the  dungeon; but he, Clarence, would find a way to come and see me every  now and then, and cheer me up, and help me get word to my friends.    Get word to my friends!  I thanked him; I couldn't do less; and  about this time a lackey came to say I was wanted; so Clarence  led me in and took me off to one side and sat down by me.    Well, it was a curious kind of spectacle, and interesting. It was  an immense place, and rather naked--yes, and full of loud contrasts.  It was very, very lofty; so lofty that the banners depending from  the arched beams and girders away up there floated in a sort of  twilight; there was a stone-railed gallery at each end, high up,  with musicians in the one, and women, clothed in stunning colors,  in the other.  The floor was of big stone flags laid in black and  white squares, rather battered by age and use, and needing repair.  As to ornament, there wasn't any, strictly speaking; though on  the walls hung some huge tapestries which were probably taxed  as works of art; battle-pieces, they were, with horses shaped like  those which children cut out of paper or create in gingerbread;  with men on them in scale armor whose scales are represented by  round holes--so that the man's coat looks as if it had been done  with a biscuit-punch.  There was a fireplace big enough to camp in;  and its projecting sides and hood, of carved and pillared stonework,  had the look of a cathedral door.  Along the walls stood men-at-arms,  in breastplate and morion, with halberds for their only weapon  --rigid as statues; and that is what they looked like.    In the middle of this groined and vaulted public square was an oaken  table which they called the Table Round.  It was as large as  a circus ring; and around it sat a great company of men dressed  in such various and splendid colors that it hurt one's eyes to look  at them.  They wore their plumed hats, right along, except that  whenever one addressed himself directly to the king, he lifted  his hat a trifle just as he was beginning his remark.    Mainly they were drinking--from entire ox horns; but a few were  still munching bread or gnawing beef bones.  There was about  an average of two dogs to one man; and these sat in expectant  attitudes till a spent bone was flung to them, and then they went  for it by brigades and divisions, with a rush, and there ensued  a fight which filled the prospect with a tumultuous chaos of  plunging heads and bodies and flashing tails, and the storm of  howlings and barkings deafened all speech for the time; but that  was no matter, for the dog-fight was always a bigger interest  anyway; the men rose, sometimes, to observe it the better and bet  on it, and the ladies and the musicians stretched themselves out  over their balusters with the same object; and all broke into  delighted ejaculations from time to time. In the end, the winning  dog stretched himself out comfortably with his bone between his  paws, and proceeded to growl over it, and gnaw it, and grease  the floor with it, just as fifty others were already doing; and the  rest of the court resumed their previous industries and entertainments.    As a rule, the speech and behavior of these people were gracious  and courtly; and I noticed that they were good and serious listeners  when anybody was telling anything--I mean in a dog-fightless  interval.  And plainly, too, they were a childlike and innocent lot;  telling lies of the stateliest pattern with a most gentle and  winning naivety, and ready and willing to listen to anybody else's  lie, and believe it, too.  It was hard to associate them with  anything cruel or dreadful; and yet they dealt in tales of blood  and suffering with a guileless relish that made me almost forget  to shudder.    I was not the only prisoner present.  There were twenty or more.  Poor devils, many of them were maimed, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7243"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 2. (#3)"],[1," a thousand men before him.  But does that make him one  of _them_?  No; the raggedest tramp in the pit would smile at  the idea.  He couldn't comprehend it; couldn't take it in; couldn't  in any remote way conceive of it.  Well, to the king, the nobles,  and all the nation, down to the very slaves and tramps, I was  just that kind of an elephant, and nothing more.  I was admired,  also feared; but it was as an animal is admired and feared.  The animal is not reverenced, neither was I; I was not even  respected.  I had no pedigree, no inherited title; so in the king's  and nobles' eyes I was mere dirt; the people regarded me with  wonder and awe, but there was no reverence mixed with it; through  the force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive of  anything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship.  There you see the hand of that awful power, the Roman Catholic  Church.  In two or three little centuries it had converted a nation  of men to a nation of worms.  Before the day of the Church's  supremacy in the world, men were men, and held their heads up,  and had a man's pride and spirit and independence; and what  of greatness and position a person got, he got mainly by achievement,  not by birth.  But then the Church came to the front, with an axe  to grind; and she was wise, subtle, and knew more than one way  to skin a cat--or a nation; she invented \"divine right of kings,\"  and propped it all around, brick by brick, with the Beatitudes  --wrenching them from their good purpose to make them fortify  an evil one; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience  to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice; she preached (to the  commoner) meekness under insult; preached (still to the commoner,  always to the commoner) patience, meanness of spirit, non-resistance  under oppression; and she introduced heritable ranks and  aristocracies, and taught all the Christian populations of the earth  to bow down to them and worship them.  Even down to my birth-century  that poison was still in the blood of Christendom, and the best  of English commoners was still content to see his inferiors  impudently continuing to hold a number of positions, such as  lordships and the throne, to which the grotesque laws of his country  did not allow him to aspire; in fact, he was not merely contented  with this strange condition of things, he was even able to persuade  himself that he was proud of it.  It seems to show that there isn't  anything you can't stand, if you are only born and bred to it.  Of course that taint, that reverence for rank and title, had been  in our American blood, too--I know that; but when I left America  it had disappeared--at least to all intents and purposes.  The  remnant of it was restricted to the dudes and dudesses.  When  a disease has worked its way down to that level, it may fairly  be said to be out of the system.    But to return to my anomalous position in King Arthur's kingdom.  Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master  intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement  the one and only actually great man in that whole British world;  and yet there and then, just as in the remote England of my  birth-time, the sheep-witted earl who could claim long descent  from a king's leman, acquired at second-hand from the slums of  London, was a better man than I was.  Such a personage was fawned  upon in Arthur's realm and reverently looked up to by everybody,  even though his dispositions were as mean as his intelligence,  and his morals as base as his lineage.  There were times when  _he_ could sit down in the king's presence, but I couldn't.  I could  have got a title easily enough, and that would have raised me  a large step in everybody's eyes; even in the king's, the giver  of it.  But I didn't ask for it; and I declined it when it was  offered.  I couldn't have enjoyed such a thing with my notions;  and it wouldn't have been fair, anyway, because as far back as  I could go, our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister.  I couldn't have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud  and set-up over any title except one that should come from the nation  itself, the only legitimate source; and such an one I hoped to win;  and in the course of years of honest and honorable endeavor, I did  win it and did wear it with a high and clean pride.  This title  fell casually from the lips of a blacksmith, one day, in a village,  was caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouth  with a laugh and an affirmative vote; in ten days it had swept  the kingdom, and was become as familiar as the king's name.  I was  never known by any other designation afterward, whether in the  nation's talk or in grave debate upon matters of state at the  council-board of the sovereign.  This title, translated into modern  speech, would be THE BOSS.  Elected by the nation.  That suited me.  And it was a pretty high title.  There were very few THE'S, and  I was one of them.  If you spoke of the duke, or the earl, or  the bishop, how could anybody tell which one you meant?  But if  you spoke of The King or The Queen or The Boss, it was different.    Well, I liked the king, and as king I respected him--respected  the office; at least respected it as much as I was capable of  respecting any unearned supremacy; but as MEN I looked down upon  him and his nobles--privately.  And he and they liked me, and  respected my office; but as an animal, without birth or sham title,  they looked down upon me--and were not particularly private about it,  either.  I didn't charge for my opinion about them, and they didn't  charge for their opinion about me: the account was square, the  books balanced, everybody was satisfied.        CHAPTER IX    THE TOURNAMENT    They were always having grand tournaments there at Camelot; and  very stirring and picturesque and ridiculous human bull-fights  they were, too, but just a little wearisome to the practical mind.  However, I was generally on hand--for two reasons: a man must  not hold himself aloof from the things which his friends and his  community have at heart if he would be liked--especially as  a statesman; and both as business man and statesman I wanted  to study the tournament and see if I couldn't invent an improvement  on it.  That reminds me to remark, in passing, that the very first  official thing I did, in my administration--and it was on the very  first day of it, too--was to start a patent office; for I knew  that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was  just a crab, and couldn't travel any way but sideways or backways.    Things ran along, a tournament nearly every week; and now and then  the boys used to want me to take a hand--I mean Sir Launcelot and  the rest--but I said I would by and by; no hurry yet, and too much  government machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a-going.    We had one tournament which was continued from day to day during  more than a week, and as many as five hundred knights took part  in it, from first to last.  They were weeks gathering.  They came  on horseback from everywhere; from the very ends of the country,  and even from beyond the sea; and many brought ladies, and all  brought squires and troops of servants.  It was a most gaudy and  gorgeous crowd, as to costumery, and very characteristic of the  country and the time, in the way of high animal spirits, innocent  indecencies of language, and happy-hearted indifference to morals.  It was fight or look on, all day and every day; and sing, gamble,  dance, carouse half the night every night.  They had a most noble  good time.  You never saw such people.  Those banks of beautiful  ladies, shining in their barbaric splendors, would see a knight  sprawl from his horse in the lists with a lanceshaft the thickness  of your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting, and instead  of fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for a  better view; only sometimes one would dive into her handkerchief,  and look ostentatiously broken-hearted, and then you could lay  two to one that there was a scandal there somewhere and she was  afraid the public hadn't found it out.    The noise at night would have been annoying to me ordinarily, but  I didn't mind it in the present circumstances, because it kept me  from hearing the quacks detaching legs and arms from the day's  cripples.  They ruined an uncommon good old cross-cut saw for me,  and broke the saw-buck, too, but I let it pass.  And as for my  axe--well, I made up my mind that the next time I lent an axe  to a surgeon I would pick my century.    I not only watched this tournament from day to day, but detailed  an intelligent priest from my Department of Public Morals and  Agriculture, and ordered him to report it; for it was my purpose  by and by, when I should have gotten the people along far enough,  to start a newspaper.  The first thing you want in a new country,  is a patent office; then work up your school system; and after that,  out with your paper.  A newspaper has its faults, and plenty of them,  but no matter, it's hark from the tomb for a dead nation, and don't  you forget it.  You can't resurrect a dead nation without it; there  isn't any way.  So I wanted to sample things, and be finding out  what sort of reporter-material I might be able to rake together out  of the sixth century when I should come to need it.    Well, the priest did very well, considering.  He got in all  the details, and that is a good thing in a local item: you see,  he had kept books for the undertaker-department of his church  when he was younger, and there, you know, the money's in the details;  the more details, the more swag: bearers, mutes, candles, prayers  --everything counts; and if the bereaved don't buy prayers enough  you mark up your candles with a forked pencil, and your bill  shows up all right.  And he had a good knack at getting in the"]]]
