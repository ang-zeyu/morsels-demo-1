Understand  this fully, and the major theme of Mormonism is comprehended. It will  have a matchless exemplification in the story of the lives of these  single-hearted, simple-minded, but grand women, opening to the reader's  view the methods of that ancient genius, even to the establishing of  the patriarchal institution and covenant of polygamy.    That America should bring forth a peculiar people, like the Mormons,  is as natural as that a mother should bear children in the semblance  of the father who begat them. Monstrous, indeed, would it be if, as  offspring of the patriarchs and mothers of this nation, America brought  forth naught but godless politicians.        CHAPTER II.    THE MOTHER OF THE PROPHET--THE GIFTS OF INSPIRATION AND WORKING OF  MIRACLES INHERENT IN HER FAMILY--FRAGMENTS OF HER NARRATIVE.    First among the chosen women of the latter-day dispensation comes the  mother of the Prophet, to open this divine drama.    It is one of our most beautiful and suggestive proverbs that \"great  men have great mothers.\" This cannot but be peculiarly true of a great  prophet whose soul is conceptive of a new dispensation.    Prophecy is of the woman. She endows her offspring with that  heaven-born gift.    The father of Joseph was a grand patriarchal type. He was the Abraham  of the Church, holding the office of presiding patriarch. To this  day he is remembered and spoken of by the early disciples with the  profoundest veneration and filial love, and his patriarchal blessings,  given to them, are preserved and valued as much as are the patriarchal  blessings of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob valued by their own race.    But it is the mother of the Prophet who properly leads in opening the  testament of the women of Mormondom. She was a prophetess and seeress  born. The gift of prophecy and the power to work miracles also inhered  in the family of Lucy Mack, (her maiden name), and the martial spirit  which distinguished her son, making him a prophet-general, was quite  characteristic of her race. Of her brother, Major Mack, she says:    \"My brother was in the city of Detroit in 1812, the year in which Hull  surrendered the territory to the British crown. My brother, being  somewhat celebrated for his prowess, was selected by General Hull to  take the command of a company as captain. After a short service in this  office he was ordered to surrender. (Hull's surrender to the British).  At this his indignation was aroused to the highest pitch. He broke his  sword across his knee, and throwing it into the river, exclaimed that  he would never submit to such a disgraceful compromise while the blood  of an American continued to flow in his veins.\"    Lucy Mack's father, Solomon Mack, was a soldier in the American  revolution. He entered the army at the age of twenty-one, in the year  1755, and in the glorious struggle of his country for independence he  enlisted among the patriots in 1776. With him were his two boys, Jason  and Stephen, the latter being the same who afterwards broke his sword  and cast it into the river rather than surrender it to the British.    But that which is most interesting here is the seeric gift coupled  with the miracle-working power of \"Mother Lucy's\" race. Hers was a  \"visionary\" family, in the main, while her elder brother, Jason, was  a strange evangelist, who wandered about during his lifetime, by sea  and land, preaching the gospel and working miracles. This Jason even  attempted to establish a body of Christian communists. Of him she says:    \"Jason, my oldest brother, was a studious and manly boy. Before he had  attained his sixteenth year he became what was then called a 'seeker,'  and believing that by prayer and faith the gifts of the gospel, which  were enjoyed by the ancient disciples of Christ, might be attained, he  labored almost incessantly to convert others to the same faith. He was  also of the opinion that God would, at some subsequent period, manifest  His power, as He had anciently done, in signs and wonders. At the age  of twenty he became a preacher of the gospel.\"    Then followed a love episode in Jason's life, in which the young man  was betrayed by his rival while absent in England on business with his  father. The rival gave out that Jason had died in Liverpool, (being  post-master, he had also intercepted their correspondence,) so that  when the latter returned home he found his betrothed married to his  enemy. The story runs:    \"As soon as Jason arrived he repaired immediately to her father's  house. When he got there she was gone to her brother's funeral; he went  in, and seated himself in the same room where he had once paid his  addresses to her. In a short time she came home; when she first saw him  she did not know him, but when she got a full view of his countenance  she recognized him, and instantly fainted. From this time forward she  never recovered her health, but, lingering for two years, died the  victim of disappointment.    \"Jason remained in the neighborhood a short time and then went to sea,  but he did not follow the sea a great while. He soon left the main, and  commenced preaching, which he continued until his death.\"    Once or twice during his lifetime Jason visited his family; at last,  after a silence of twenty years, his brother Solomon received from him  the following very evangelistic epistle:                                                 \"South Branch of Ormucto,                                               \"Province of New Brunswick,                                                           \"June 30, 1835.        \"MY DEAR BROTHER SOLOMON: You will, no doubt, be surprised to hear      that I am still alive, although in an absence of twenty years I      have never written to you before. But I trust you will forgive me      when I tell you that, for most of the twenty years, I have been so      situated that I have had little or no communication with the lines,      and have been holding meetings, day and night, from place to place;      besides my mind has been so taken up with the deplorable situation      of the earth, the darkness in which it lies, that, when my labors      did call me near the lines, I did not realize the opportunity which      presented itself of letting you know where I was. And, again, I      have designed visiting you long since, and annually have promised      myself that the succeeding year I would certainly seek out my      relatives, and enjoy the privilege of one pleasing interview with      them before I passed into the valley and shadow of death. But      last, though not least, let me not startle you when I say, that,      according to my early adopted principles of the power of faith, the      Lord has, in his exceeding kindness, bestowed upon me the gift of      healing by the prayer of faith, and the use of such simple means as      seem congenial to the human system; but my chief reliance is upon      Him who organized us at the first, and can restore at pleasure that      which is disorganized.        \"The first of my peculiar success in this way was twelve years      since, and from nearly that date I have had little rest. In      addition to the incessant calls which I in a short time had, there      was the most overwhelming torrent of opposition poured down upon      me that I ever witnessed. But it pleased God to take the weak to      confound the wisdom of the wise. I have in the last twelve years      seen the greatest manifestations of the power of God in healing      the sick, that, with all my sanguinity, I ever hoped or imagined.      And when the learned infidel has declared with sober face, time      and again, that disease had obtained such an ascendency that death      could be resisted no longer, that the victim must wither beneath      his potent arm, I have seen the almost lifeless clay slowly but      surely resuscitated and revived, till the pallid monster fled so      far that the patient was left in the full bloom of vigorous health.      But it is God that hath done it, and to Him let all the praise be      given.        \"I am now compelled to close this epistle, for I must start      immediately on a journey of more than one hundred miles, to attend      a heavy case of sickness; so God be with you all. Farewell!                                                         \"JASON MACK.\"    \"Mother Lucy,\" in the interesting accounts of her own and husband's  families, tells some charming stories of visions, dreams, and miracles  among them, indicating the advent of the latter-day power; but the  remarkable visions and mission of her prophet son claim the ruling  place. She says:    \"There was a great revival of religion, which extended to all the  denominations of Christians in the surrounding country in which we  resided. Many of the world's people, becoming concerned about the  salvation of their souls, came forward and presented themselves as  seekers after religion. Most of them were desirous of uniting with some  church, but were not decided as to the particular faith which they  would adopt. When the numerous meetings were about breaking up, and the  candidates and the various leading church members began to consult upon  the subject of adopting the candidates into some church or churches, as  the case might be, a dispute arose, and there was a great contention  among them.    \"While these things were going forward, Joseph's mind became  considerably troubled with regard to religion; and the following  extract from his history will show, more clearly than I can express,  the state of his feelings, and the result of his reflections on this  occasion:\"        \"I was at this time in my fifteenth year. My father's family was      proselyted to the Presbyterian faith, and four of them joined      that church, namely, my mother Lucy, my brothers Hyrum and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54337"],[0,"Reminiscences of Joseph, the Prophet, and the Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon (#3)"],[1,"left the  Tower of Babel 2000 B.C.) was Ramah, as found in their history, page  606, new edition. This history is called the Book of Mormon, and this  portion is written by a historian named Ether.    It was named the second time by an entirely different people, and  called Cumorah, as found on page 559, new edition, of the same book, by  the historian whose name was Mormon.    The third name is Bible Hill, or Mormon Hill, and was given in the year  1829.    Having studied the history of these lost nations, I felt very much  inclined to gratify the desires awakened in my bosom to visit the  place. Impelled by these aspiration, I undertook the journey and soon  found myself at a pleasant and commodious hotel in Palmyra.    Early on a summer's morning in the year 1870, after a gentle shower  during the night, with just sufficient rainfall to lay the dust, I  set out to walk to the hill. Never can I forget the lovely scenery of  that lonely but interesting walk down the most excellent Canandaigua  turnpike. Among the objects passed on the way was the former home of  Joseph Smith, and the very old and comely schoolhouse where he learned  some of his early lessons.    Arriving near the object of my morning's walk, I set bout inquiring for  the Hill Cumorah. But not one could I find in all the country round who  could give me the desired information; until one, and the right one  too, who was made to comprehend my mind and wish, said, \"Is it Mormon  Hill that you want, or what is more familiarly known among us in this  country as 'Bible Hill,' where old Joe Smith found the Mormon Bible? Is  it this place you wish to find?\"    Having answered affirmatively the question, I was not only enabled,  by my friend's direction, to learn the third and last name given to  this hill, but to find myself standing upon the summit of one of the  most interesting objects of my 100,000 miles' travel. It appeared more  like a dream than a stern reality. Could it be possible that here was  the identical spot of ground where stood a being who had lived in  the fourth century, some fourteen hundred and fifty years prior to  my occupying this position? Indeed, it was verily true. But, oh! the  wonderful contrast between the two views, and the changes of scenery  in that time! Now a beautiful landscape: such a one as delights the  vision, until the mind becomes swallowed up and absorbed in deep  reflection. There are beauties of hills and dales, orchards and farms,  lawns and gardens on every side, more especially to the north, east and  west. Just for a moment cast your eye on the engraving, which is the  one of my choice, exhibiting, as it does, a north front, and to my mind  the most lovely view of all. There are differing pictures of this hill,  some real and some imaginary. The one presented is from a painting made  from a photograph which Apostle F. D. Richards had taken while on a  visit to this historic hill and country.    Some cows and other additions have been made to the picture, such as  the carriage conveying the visitors along the roadway by the fence,  to the house, where the owner of the hill and surroundings lives. But  the main features of the hill are true representations of it, so much  so that J. W. Fox, Jr., also Bishop G. H. Taylor, both of whom visited  the place some years before, say it is the best picture of it that they  have ever seen presented.    Brother Edward Hold, of South Jordan Ward had a vision of the hill  (similar to the one the prophet Joseph Smith had), and described it  very minutely before seeing the picture of it. He said, just above  where he saw a portion of the top of the stone box there was a tree,  and upon this point I interrogated him closely, stating that only two  years previous Bishop Black, Brother Andrew Jenson and I had visited  the spot of ground, and there was no tree there; but he insisted that  there was a tree just above the stone box, a clumpy tree, for he saw  one there. It became necessary for an explanation before he should see  the picture.    At the period of discovery of the gold plates, there stood upon the  side of the hill, about fifteen feet above where the stone box had so  long reposed, a lone, solitary, sugar maple tree, and there continued  to grow until twenty-two years ago, just as described by Brother Holt,  who was so highly favored of God as to see the whole scene in a vision  or dream.    What made Brother Holt's vision all the more deeply interesting to me  was that in 1871 I had enjoyed the great privilege and pleasure of  visiting the hill in person, and of seeing the very identical spot of  ground where Mormon concealed the stone box and its precious records  and where Moroni, his son, finished the writing and sealed up these  records. But there was no tree standing there as was described in the  vision, for it had been cut down shortly before and was lying on the  ground, not having as yet been removed. It was a clumpy sort of a  tree, about two feet in diameter. For a long time it had stood there  like a solitary sentinel guarding the sacred spot which contained  the book that was to shape the destinies of thousands upon thousands  of the human race, and people the heavens with the true sons and  daughters of God. I have always regretted the removal of that tree,  for it was a conspicuous mark on the northwest point of the now almost  treeless hill. After satisfying Brother Hold as to the absence of the  tree, which he had seen in his vision, he very readily recognized the  painting as being a correct and accurate representation of the deeply  interesting Hill Cumorah as he had seen it in his vision forty years  before.    Brother Holt, with respect to his vision, stated that he \"had retired  to bed, after reading the Book of Mormon, and that he had entertained  some doubts regarding the vision Joseph Smith had of the hill, and of  his finding the stone box containing the plates. But the vision which  he had himself received concerning the matter served to remove every  shadow of a doubt from his mind, for all future time. In the last  chapter, written by Moroni just before closing or sealing up the box,  he engraved upon the plates the following words: \"And I seal up these  records, after I have spoken a few words, by way of exhortation, unto  you; behold, I would exhort you, that when ye shall read these things,  if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember  how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the  creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these  things. I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the eternal Father,  in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall  ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ,  he will manifest the truth of it unto you.\" Brother Holt, as well  as hundreds of others, can testify that these words are true and in  consonance with the words of Jesus Christ himself, \"Ask and it shall be  given unto you, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened  unto you,\" and also in accordance with the words of James, who says,  \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men  liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him,\" but \"let him  ask in faith, nothing wavering.\"    The boy Joseph did not ask in vain, neither will any other person ask  in vain who asks in faith for the word of the Lord faileth not but  endureth forever. My guide who accompanied me on my visit in 1871,  pointed out to me many places of interest, and also entertained me  hospitably at his table, where a number of harvesters had assembled.  The covered carriage represented in the picture is conveying our party  on my second visit to the house in which we all dined together, which  is situated to the left of the painting. The dinner party to me was  highly interesting, and all the more so as we sat conversing about  the things of God right in the shadow of the Hill Cumorah. All spoke  freely, and asked many questions, which I felt it a great pleasure  to answer. They were anxious to hear something of the spread of the  work since the gold plates were discovered in that remarkable hill,  and I very gladly gratified them with a short account of the rise and  progress of this \"marvelous work and a wonder,\" from the day the angel  visited Cumorah and gave the plates to Joseph, the boy-prophet, down to  the present time, when the work has gathered into its cause some two  hundred and fifty thousand Saints, and founded the Territory of Utah  in the west. The conclusion come to by this party of harvesters was  that the subject of our conversation was indeed a \"marvellous work and  wonder.\" Still, like many other time-servers and worldly-wise people,  they felt their spirits weakening within them, and they exclaimed, \"But  Mormonism is so very unpopular!\"    \"Yes,\" I replied, \"it has been so since the Jews and Gentiles murdered  the Chief Shepherd.\"    Our pleasant entertainment and agreeable conversation here terminated,  after bearing my testimony to the divinity of the restored gospel,  and to the fact that more than fourteen hundred years ago the gold  plates, that contained the same, were sealed up and deposited in this  very hill, destined to come forth and revolutionize the world, in  these latter days. Cordially bidding good-day to my hospitable host, I  proceeded on my way, and found an old gentleman who lived west of the  hill and who was quite agreeable and conversational on the subject of  my visit to Cumorah. He was well-acquainted with some of the history of  the coming forth of the book which was to \"speak out of the ground,\"  although spiritually, he did not seem to have greatly benefited by this  \"marvelous work and a wonder.\" Still, from him I gleaned some useful  information. He pointed out the spot of ground where the stone box was  placed, near the summit, and on the west side of the"]]]
