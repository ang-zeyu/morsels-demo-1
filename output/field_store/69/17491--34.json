Hanging on  a panel near by was a calendar with the date of the 5th of September.    \"Oh,\" cried Hortense, in astonishment, \"the same date as to-day!... They  tore off the leaves until the 5th of September.... And this is the  anniversary! What an astonishing coincidence!\"    \"Astonishing,\" he echoed. \"It's the anniversary of their departure ...  twenty years ago to-day.\"    \"You must admit,\" she said, \"that all this is incomprehensible.    \"Yes, of course ... but, all the same ... perhaps not.\"    \"Have you any idea?\"    He waited a few seconds before replying:    \"What puzzles me is this telescope hidden, dropped in that corner, at  the last moment. I wonder what it was used for.... From the ground-floor  windows you see nothing but the trees in the garden ... and the same, I  expect, from all the windows.... We are in a valley, without the least open  horizon.... To use the telescope, one would have to go up to the top of the  house.... Shall we go up?\"    She did not hesitate. The mystery surrounding the whole adventure excited  her curiosity so keenly that she could think of nothing but accompanying  Renine and assisting him in his investigations.    They went upstairs accordingly, and, on the second floor, came to a landing  where they found the spiral staircase leading to the belvedere.    At the top of this was a platform in the open air, but surrounded by a  parapet over six feet high.    \"There must have been battlements which have been filled in since,\"  observed Prince Renine. \"Look here, there were loop-holes at one time. They  may have been blocked.\"    \"In any case,\" she said, \"the telescope was of no use up here either and we  may as well go down again.\"    \"I don't agree,\" he said. \"Logic tells us that there must have been some  gap through which the country could be seen and this was the spot where the  telescope was used.\"    He hoisted himself by his wrists to the top of the parapet and then saw  that this point of vantage commanded the whole of the valley, including the  park, with its tall trees marking the horizon; and, beyond, a depression  in a wood surmounting a hill, at a distance of some seven or eight hundred  yards, stood another tower, squat and in ruins, covered with ivy from top  to bottom.    Renine resumed his inspection. He seemed to consider that the key to the  problem lay in the use to which the telescope was put and that the problem  would be solved if only they could discover this use.    He studied the loop-holes one after the other. One of them, or rather the  place which it had occupied, attracted his attention above the rest. In  the middle of the layer of plaster, which had served to block it, there  was a hollow filled with earth in which plants had grown. He pulled out  the plants and removed the earth, thus clearing the mouth of a hole some  five inches in diameter, which completely penetrated the wall. On bending  forward, Renine perceived that this deep and narrow opening inevitably  carried the eye, above the dense tops of the trees and through the  depression in the hill, to the ivy-clad tower.    At the bottom of this channel, in a sort of groove which ran through it  like a gutter, the telescope fitted so exactly that it was quite impossible  to shift it, however little, either to the right or to the left.    Renine, after wiping the outside of the lenses, while taking care not to  disturb the lie of the instrument by a hair's breadth, put his eye to the  small end.    He remained for thirty or forty seconds, gazing attentively and silently.  Then he drew himself up and said, in a husky voice:    \"It's terrible ... it's really terrible.\"    \"What is?\" she asked, anxiously.    \"Look.\"    She bent down but the image was not clear to her and the telescope had to  be focussed to suit her sight. The next moment she shuddered and said:    \"It's two scarecrows, isn't it, both stuck up on the top? But why?\"    \"Look again,\" he said. \"Look more carefully under the hats ... the  faces....\"    \"Oh!\" she cried, turning faint with horror, \"how awful!\"    The field of the telescope, like the circular picture shown by a magic  lantern, presented this spectacle: the platform of a broken tower, the  walls of which were higher in the more distant part and formed as it were  a back-drop, over which surged waves of ivy. In front, amid a cluster of  bushes, were two human beings, a man and a woman, leaning back against a  heap of fallen stones.    But the words man and woman could hardly be applied to these two forms,  these two sinister puppets, which, it is true, wore clothes and hats--or  rather shreds of clothes and remnants of hats--but had lost their eyes,  their cheeks, their chins, every particle of flesh, until they were  actually and positively nothing more than two skeletons.    \"Two skeletons,\" stammered Hortense. \"Two skeletons with clothes on. Who  carried them up there?\"    \"Nobody.\"    \"But still....\"    \"That man and that woman must have died at the top of the tower, years and  years ago ... and their flesh rotted under their clothes and the ravens ate  them.\"    \"But it's hideous, hideous!\" cried Hortense, pale as death, her face drawn  with horror.           *       *       *       *       *    Half an hour later, Hortense Daniel and Renine left the Chateau de  Halingre. Before their departure, they had gone as far as the ivy-grown  tower, the remains of an old donjon-keep more than half demolished. The  inside was empty. There seemed to have been a way of climbing to the top,  at a comparatively recent period, by means of wooden stairs and ladders  which now lay broken and scattered over the ground. The tower backed  against the wall which marked the end of the park.    A curious fact, which surprised Hortense, was that Prince Renine had  neglected to pursue a more minute enquiry, as though the matter had lost  all interest for him. He did not even speak of it any longer; and, in the  inn at which they stopped and took a light meal in the nearest village, it  was she who asked the landlord about the abandoned chateau. But she learnt  nothing from him, for the man was new to the district and could give her no  particulars. He did not even know the name of the owner.    They turned their horses' heads towards La Mareze. Again and again Hortense  recalled the squalid sight which had met their eyes. But Renine, who was  in a lively mood and full of attentions to his companion, seemed utterly  indifferent to those questions.    \"But, after all,\" she exclaimed, impatiently, \"we can't leave the matter  there! It calls for a solution.\"    \"As you say,\" he replied, \"a solution is called for. M. Rossigny has to  know where he stands and you have to decide what to do about him.\"    She shrugged her shoulders: \"He's of no importance for the moment. The  thing to-day....\"    \"Is what?\"    \"Is to know what those two dead bodies are.\"    \"Still, Rossigny....\"    \"Rossigny can wait. But I can't. You have shown me a mystery which is now  the only thing that matters. What do you intend to do?\"    \"To do?\"    \"Yes. There are two bodies.... You'll inform the police, I suppose.\"    \"Gracious goodness!\" he exclaimed, laughing. \"What for?\"    \"Well, there's a riddle that has to be cleared up at all costs, a terrible  tragedy.\"    \"We don't need any one to do that.\"    \"What! Do you mean to say that you understand it?\"    \"Almost as plainly as though I had read it in a book, told in full detail,  with explanatory illustrations. It's all so simple!\"    She looked at him askance, wondering if he was making fun of her. But he  seemed quite serious.    \"Well?\" she asked, quivering with curiosity.    The light was beginning to wane. They had trotted at a good pace; and the  hunt was returning as they neared La Mareze.    \"Well,\" he said, \"we shall get the rest of our information from people  living round about ... from your uncle, for instance; and you will see how  logically all the facts fit in. When you hold the first link of a chain,  you are bound, whether you like it or not, to reach the last. It's the  greatest fun in the world.\"    Once in the house, they separated. On going to her room, Hortense found her  luggage and a furious letter from Rossigny in which he bade her good-bye  and announced his departure.    Then Renine knocked at her door:    \"Your uncle is in the library,\" he said. \"Will you go down with me? I've  sent word that I am coming.\"    She went with him. He added:    \"One word more. This morning, when I thwarted your plans and begged you to  trust me, I naturally undertook an obligation towards you which I mean to  fulfill without delay. I want to give you a positive proof of this.\"    She laughed:    \"The only obligation which you took upon yourself was to satisfy my  curiosity.\"    \"It shall be satisfied,\" he assured her, gravely, \"and more fully than you  can possibly imagine.\"    M. d'Aigleroche was alone. He was smoking his pipe and drinking sherry. He  offered a glass to Renine, who refused.    \"Well, Hortense!\" he said, in a rather thick voice. \"You know that it's  pretty dull here, except in these September days. You must make the most  of them. Have you had a pleasant ride with Renine?\"    \"That's just what I wanted to talk about, my dear sir,\" interrupted the  prince.    \"You must excuse me, but I have to go to the station in ten minutes, to  meet a friend of my wife's.\"    \"Oh, ten minutes will be ample!\"    \"Just the time to smoke a cigarette?\"    \"No longer.\"    He took a cigarette from the case which M. d'Aigleroche handed to him, lit  it and said:    \"I must tell you that our ride happened to take us to an old domain which  you are sure to know, the Domaine de Halingre.\"    \"Certainly I know it. But it has been closed, boarded up for twenty-five  years or so. You weren't able to get in, I suppose?\"    \"Yes, we were.\"    \"Really? Was it interesting?\"    \"Extremely. We discovered the strangest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/792"],[0,"Wieland; Or, The Transformation: An American Tale (#3)"],[1,"the agonies which he seemed to suffer without the  deepest compassion. Time, instead of lightening the burthen, appeared to  add to it. At length he hinted to his wife, that his end was near. His  imagination did not prefigure the mode or the time of his decease, but  was fraught with an incurable persuasion that his death was at hand. He  was likewise haunted by the belief that the kind of death that awaited  him was strange and terrible. His anticipations were thus far vague and  indefinite; but they sufficed to poison every moment of his being, and  devote him to ceaseless anguish.        Chapter II      Early in the morning of a sultry day in August, he left Mettingen, to go  to the city. He had seldom passed a day from home since his return from  the shores of the Ohio. Some urgent engagements at this time existed,  which would not admit of further delay. He returned in the evening, but  appeared to be greatly oppressed with fatigue. His silence and dejection  were likewise in a more than ordinary degree conspicuous. My mother's  brother, whose profession was that of a surgeon, chanced to spend this  night at our house. It was from him that I have frequently received an  exact account of the mournful catastrophe that followed.    As the evening advanced, my father's inquietudes increased. He sat with  his family as usual, but took no part in their conversation. He appeared  fully engrossed by his own reflections. Occasionally his countenance  exhibited tokens of alarm; he gazed stedfastly and wildly at the  ceiling; and the exertions of his companions were scarcely sufficient  to interrupt his reverie. On recovering from these fits, he expressed no  surprize; but pressing his hand to his head, complained, in a tremulous  and terrified tone, that his brain was scorched to cinders. He would  then betray marks of insupportable anxiety.    My uncle perceived, by his pulse, that he was indisposed, but in no  alarming degree, and ascribed appearances chiefly to the workings of his  mind. He exhorted him to recollection and composure, but in vain. At the  hour of repose he readily retired to his chamber. At the persuasion of  my mother he even undressed and went to bed. Nothing could abate his  restlessness. He checked her tender expostulations with some sternness.  \"Be silent,\" said he, \"for that which I feel there is but one cure,  and that will shortly come. You can help me nothing. Look to your own  condition, and pray to God to strengthen you under the calamities that  await you.\" \"What am I to fear?\" she answered. \"What terrible disaster  is it that you think of?\" \"Peace--as yet I know it not myself, but come  it will, and shortly.\" She repeated her inquiries and doubts; but he  suddenly put an end to the discourse, by a stern command to be silent.    She had never before known him in this mood. Hitherto all was benign in  his deportment. Her heart was pierced with sorrow at the contemplation  of this change. She was utterly unable to account for it, or to figure  to herself the species of disaster that was menaced.    Contrary to custom, the lamp, instead of being placed on the hearth, was  left upon the table. Over it against the wall there hung a small clock,  so contrived as to strike a very hard stroke at the end of every sixth  hour. That which was now approaching was the signal for retiring to the  fane at which he addressed his devotions. Long habit had occasioned him  to be always awake at this hour, and the toll was instantly obeyed.    Now frequent and anxious glances were cast at the clock. Not a single  movement of the index appeared to escape his notice. As the hour verged  towards twelve his anxiety visibly augmented. The trepidations of my  mother kept pace with those of her husband; but she was intimidated  into silence. All that was left to her was to watch every change of his  features, and give vent to her sympathy in tears.    At length the hour was spent, and the clock tolled. The sound appeared  to communicate a shock to every part of my father's frame. He rose  immediately, and threw over himself a loose gown. Even this office  was performed with difficulty, for his joints trembled, and his teeth  chattered with dismay. At this hour his duty called him to the rock, and  my mother naturally concluded that it was thither he intended to repair.  Yet these incidents were so uncommon, as to fill her with astonishment  and foreboding. She saw him leave the room, and heard his steps as they  hastily descended the stairs. She half resolved to rise and pursue him,  but the wildness of the scheme quickly suggested itself. He was going  to a place whither no power on earth could induce him to suffer an  attendant.    The window of her chamber looked toward the rock. The atmosphere was  clear and calm, but the edifice could not be discovered at that distance  through the dusk. My mother's anxiety would not allow her to remain  where she was. She rose, and seated herself at the window. She strained  her sight to get a view of the dome, and of the path that led to it. The  first painted itself with sufficient distinctness on her fancy, but  was undistinguishable by the eye from the rocky mass on which it was  erected. The second could be imperfectly seen; but her husband had  already passed, or had taken a different direction.    What was it that she feared? Some disaster impended over her husband or  herself. He had predicted evils, but professed himself ignorant of what  nature they were. When were they to come? Was this night, or this hour  to witness the accomplishment? She was tortured with impatience, and  uncertainty. All her fears were at present linked to his person, and she  gazed at the clock, with nearly as much eagerness as my father had done,  in expectation of the next hour.    An half hour passed away in this state of suspence. Her eyes were fixed  upon the rock; suddenly it was illuminated. A light proceeding from the  edifice, made every part of the scene visible. A gleam diffused itself  over the intermediate space, and instantly a loud report, like the  explosion of a mine, followed. She uttered an involuntary shriek, but  the new sounds that greeted her ear, quickly conquered her surprise.  They were piercing shrieks, and uttered without intermission. The gleams  which had diffused themselves far and wide were in a moment withdrawn,  but the interior of the edifice was filled with rays.    The first suggestion was that a pistol was discharged, and that the  structure was on fire. She did not allow herself time to meditate a  second thought, but rushed into the entry and knocked loudly at the door  of her brother's chamber. My uncle had been previously roused by the  noise, and instantly flew to the window. He also imagined what he saw  to be fire. The loud and vehement shrieks which succeeded the first  explosion, seemed to be an invocation of succour. The incident was  inexplicable; but he could not fail to perceive the propriety of  hastening to the spot. He was unbolting the door, when his sister's  voice was heard on the outside conjuring him to come forth.    He obeyed the summons with all the speed in his power. He stopped not  to question her, but hurried down stairs and across the meadow which lay  between the house and the rock. The shrieks were no longer to be heard;  but a blazing light was clearly discernible between the columns of the  temple. Irregular steps, hewn in the stone, led him to the summit. On  three sides, this edifice touched the very verge of the cliff. On the  fourth side, which might be regarded as the front, there was an area  of small extent, to which the rude staircase conducted you. My uncle  speedily gained this spot. His strength was for a moment exhausted  by his haste. He paused to rest himself. Meanwhile he bent the most  vigilant attention towards the object before him.    Within the columns he beheld what he could no better describe, than  by saying that it resembled a cloud impregnated with light. It had  the brightness of flame, but was without its upward motion. It did not  occupy the whole area, and rose but a few feet above the floor. No  part of the building was on fire. This appearance was astonishing. He  approached the temple. As he went forward the light retired, and, when  he put his feet within the apartment, utterly vanished. The suddenness  of this transition increased the darkness that succeeded in a tenfold  degree. Fear and wonder rendered him powerless. An occurrence like this,  in a place assigned to devotion, was adapted to intimidate the stoutest  heart.    His wandering thoughts were recalled by the groans of one near him.  His sight gradually recovered its power, and he was able to discern my  father stretched on the floor. At that moment, my mother and servants  arrived with a lanthorn, and enabled my uncle to examine more closely  this scene. My father, when he left the house, besides a loose upper  vest and slippers, wore a shirt and drawers. Now he was naked, his skin  throughout the greater part of his body was scorched and bruised. His  right arm exhibited marks as of having been struck by some heavy body.  His clothes had been removed, and it was not immediately perceived that  they were reduced to ashes. His slippers and his hair were untouched.    He was removed to his chamber, and the requisite attention paid to his  wounds, which gradually became more painful. A mortification speedily  shewed itself in the arm, which had been most hurt. Soon after, the  other wounded parts exhibited the like appearance.    Immediately subsequent to this disaster, my father seemed nearly in  a state of insensibility. He was passive under every operation. He  scarcely opened his eyes, and was with difficulty prevailed upon to  answer the questions that were put to him. By his imperfect account, it  appeared, that while engaged in silent orisons, with thoughts full  of confusion and anxiety, a faint gleam suddenly"]]]
