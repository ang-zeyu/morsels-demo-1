At once a pink kitten crept out of the upset  cage, sat down upon the glass roof, and yawned and blinked its round  eyes.    \"Oh,\" said Dorothy.  \"There's Eureka.\"    \"First time I ever saw a pink cat,\" said Zeb.    \"Eureka isn't pink; she's white.  It's this queer light that gives her  that color.\"    \"Where's my milk?\" asked the kitten, looking up into Dorothy's face.  \"I'm 'most starved to death.\"    \"Oh, Eureka!  Can you talk?\"    \"Talk!  Am I talking?  Good gracious, I believe I am.  Isn't it funny?\"  asked the kitten.    \"It's all wrong,\" said Zeb, gravely.  \"Animals ought not to talk.  But  even old Jim has been saying things since we had our accident.\"    \"I can't see that it's wrong,\" remarked Jim, in his gruff tones.  \"At  least, it isn't as wrong as some other things.  What's going to become  of us now?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered the boy, looking around him curiously.    The houses of the city were all made of glass, so clear and transparent  that one could look through the walls as easily as through a window.  Dorothy saw, underneath the roof on which she stood, several rooms used  for rest chambers, and even thought she could make out a number of  queer forms huddled into the corners of these rooms.    The roof beside them had a great hole smashed through it, and pieces of  glass were lying scattered in every direction.  A nearby steeple had  been broken off short and the fragments lay heaped beside it.  Other  buildings were cracked in places or had corners chipped off from them;  but they must have been very beautiful before these accidents had  happened to mar their perfection.  The rainbow tints from the colored  suns fell upon the glass city softly and gave to the buildings many  delicate, shifting hues which were very pretty to see.    But not a sound had broken the stillness since the strangers had  arrived, except that of their own voices.  They began to wonder if  there were no people to inhabit this magnificent city of the inner  world.    Suddenly a man appeared through a hole in the roof next to the one they  were on and stepped into plain view.  He was not a very large man, but  was well formed and had a beautiful face--calm and serene as the face  of a fine portrait.  His clothing fitted his form snugly and was  gorgeously colored in brilliant shades of green, which varied as the  sunbeams touched them but was not wholly influenced by the solar rays.    The man had taken a step or two across the glass roof before he noticed  the presence of the strangers; but then he stopped abruptly.  There was  no expression of either fear or surprise upon his tranquil face, yet he  must have been both astonished and afraid; for after his eyes had  rested upon the ungainly form of the horse for a moment he walked  rapidly to the furthest edge of the roof, his head turned back over his  shoulder to gaze at the strange animal.    \"Look out!\" cried Dorothy, who noticed that the beautiful man did not  look where he was going; \"be careful, or you'll fall off!\"    But he paid no attention to her warning.  He reached the edge of the  tall roof, stepped one foot out into the air, and walked into space as  calmly as if he were on firm ground.    The girl, greatly astonished, ran to lean over the edge of the roof,  and saw the man walking rapidly through the air toward the ground.  Soon he reached the street and disappeared through a glass doorway into  one of the glass buildings.    \"How strange!\" she exclaimed, drawing a long breath.    \"Yes; but it's lots of fun, if it IS strange,\" remarked the small voice  of the kitten, and Dorothy turned to find her pet walking in the air a  foot or so away from the edge of the roof.    \"Come back, Eureka!\" she called, in distress, \"you'll certainly be  killed.\"    \"I have nine lives,\" said the kitten, purring softly as it walked  around in a circle and then came back to the roof;  \"but I can't lose  even one of them by falling in this country, because I really couldn't  manage to fall if I wanted to.\"    \"Does the air bear up your weight?\" asked the girl.    \"Of course; can't you see?\" and again the kitten wandered into the air  and back to the edge of the roof.    \"It's wonderful!\" said Dorothy.    \"Suppose we let Eureka go down to the street and get some one to help  us,\" suggested Zeb, who had been even more amazed than Dorothy at these  strange happenings.    \"Perhaps we can walk on the air ourselves,\" replied the girl.    Zeb drew back with a shiver.    \"I wouldn't dare try,\" he said.    \"Maybe Jim will go,\" continued Dorothy, looking at the horse.    \"And maybe he won't!\" answered Jim.  \"I've tumbled through the air long  enough to make me contented on this roof.\"    \"But we didn't tumble to the roof,\" said the girl; \"by the time we  reached here we were floating very slowly, and I'm almost sure we could  float down to the street without getting hurt.  Eureka walks on the air  all right.\"    \"Eureka weights only about half a pound,\" replied the horse, in a  scornful tone, \"while I weigh about half a ton.\"    \"You don't weigh as much as you ought to, Jim,\" remarked the girl,  shaking her head as she looked at the animal.  \"You're dreadfully  skinny.\"    \"Oh, well; I'm old,\" said the horse, hanging his head despondently,  \"and I've had lots of trouble in my day, little one.  For a good many  years I drew a public cab in Chicago, and that's enough to make anyone  skinny.\"    \"He eats enough to get fat, I'm sure,\" said the boy, gravely.    \"Do I?  Can you remember any breakfast that I've had today?\" growled  Jim, as if he resented Zeb's speech.    \"None of us has had breakfast,\" said the boy; \"and in a time of danger  like this it's foolish to talk about eating.\"    \"Nothing is more dangerous than being without food,\" declared the  horse, with a sniff at the rebuke of his young master; \"and just at  present no one can tell whether there are any oats in this queer  country or not.  If there are, they are liable to be glass oats!\"    \"Oh, no!\" exclaimed Dorothy.  \"I can see plenty of nice gardens and  fields down below us, at the edge of this city.  But I wish we could  find a way to get to the ground.\"    \"Why don't you walk down?\" asked Eureka.  \"I'm as hungry as the horse  is, and I want my milk.\"    \"Will you try it, Zeb?\" asked the girl, turning to her companion.    Zeb hesitated.  He was still pale and frightened, for this dreadful  adventure had upset him and made him nervous and worried.  But he did  not wish the little girl to think him a coward, so he advanced slowly  to the edge of the roof.    Dorothy stretched out a hand to him and Zeb put one foot out and let it  rest in the air a little over the edge of the roof.  It seemed firm  enough to walk upon, so he took courage and put out the other foot.  Dorothy kept hold of his hand and followed him, and soon they were both  walking through the air, with the kitten frisking beside them.    \"Come on, Jim!\" called the boy.  \"It's all right.\"    Jim had crept to the edge of the roof to look over, and being a  sensible horse and quite experienced, he made up his mind that he could  go where the others did.  So, with a snort and a neigh and a whisk of  his short tail he trotted off the roof into the air and at once began  floating downward to the street.  His great weight made him fall faster  than the children walked, and he passed them on the way down; but when  he came to the glass pavement he alighted upon it so softly that he was  not even jarred.    \"Well, well!\" said Dorothy, drawing a long breath, \"What a strange  country this is.\"    People began to come out of the glass doors to look at the new  arrivals, and pretty soon quite a crowd had assembled.  There were men  and women, but no children at all, and the folks were all beautifully  formed and attractively dressed and had wonderfully handsome faces.  There was not an ugly person in all the throng, yet Dorothy was not  especially pleased by the appearance of these people because their  features had no more expression than the faces of dolls.  They did not  smile nor did they frown, or show either fear or surprise or curiosity  or friendliness.  They simply started at the strangers, paying most  attention to Jim and Eureka, for they had never before seen either a  horse or a cat and the children bore an outward resemblance to  themselves.    Pretty soon a man joined the group who wore a glistening star in the  dark hair just over his forehead.  He seemed to be a person of  authority, for the others pressed back to give him room.  After turning  his composed eyes first upon the animals and then upon the children he  said to Zeb, who was a little taller than Dorothy:    \"Tell me, intruder, was it you who caused the Rain of Stones?\"    For a moment the boy did not know what he meant by this question.  Then, remembering the stones that had fallen with them and passed them  long before they had reached this place, he answered:    \"No, sir; we didn't cause anything.  It was the earthquake.\"    The man with the star stood for a time quietly thinking over this  speech.  Then he asked:    \"What is an earthquake?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Zeb, who was still confused.  But Dorothy, seeing  his perplexity, answered:    \"It's a shaking of the earth.  In this quake a big crack opened and we  fell through--horse and buggy, and all--and the stones got loose and  came down with us.\"    The man with the star regarded her with his calm, expressionless eyes.    \"The Rain of Stones has done much damage to our city,\" he said; \"and we  shall hold you responsible for it unless you can prove your innocence.\"    \"How can we do that?\" asked the girl.    \"That I am not prepared to say.  It is your affair, not mine.  You must  go to the House of the Sorcerer, who will soon discover the truth.\"    \"Where "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4204"],[0,"The Elements of Geology (#3)"],[1," working downward from the surface.    At certain points these agencies have been more effective than  elsewhere. The upper rock surface is pitted. Joints are widened as  they approach the surface, and along these seams we may find that  the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor.    A SHALE PIT. Let us now visit some pit where shale--a laminated  and somewhat hardened clay--is quarried for the manufacture of  brick. The laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as  cardboard in places, and close joints may break the rock into  small rhombic blocks. On the upper surface we note that the shale  has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure  have been destroyed. The clay and the upper layers of the shale  beneath it are reddish or yellow, while in many cases the color of  the unaltered rock beneath is blue.    THE SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. The three kinds of layered rocks whose  acquaintance we have made--sandstone, limestone, and shale--are  the leading types of the great group of stratified, or  sedimentary, rocks. This group includes all rocks made of  sediments, their materials having settled either in water upon the  bottoms of rivers, lakes, or seas, or on dry land, as in the case  of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers. Sedimentary rocks  are divided into the fragmental rocks--which are made of  fragments, either coarse or fine--and the far less common rocks  which are constituted of chemical precipitates.    The sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition  into the following classes:    1. The arenaceous, or quartz rocks, including beds of loose sand  and gravel, sandstone, quartzite, and conglomerate (a rock made of  cemented rounded gravel or pebbles).    2. The calcareous, or lime rocks, including limestone and a soft  white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk.    3. The argillaceous, or clay rocks, including muds, clays, and  shales. These three classes pass by mixture into one another. Thus  there are limy and clayey sandstones, sandy and clayey limestones,  and sandy and limy shales.    GRANITE. This familiar rock may be studied as an example of the  second great group of rocks,--the unstratified, or igneous rocks.  These are not made of cemented sedimentary grains, but of  interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass.  Examining a piece of granite, the most conspicuous crystals which  meet the eye are those of feldspar. They are commonly pink, white,  or yellow, and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect  the light like tiny panes of glass. Mica may be recognized by its  glittering plates, which split into thin elastic scales. A third  mineral, harder than steel, breaking along irregular surfaces like  broken glass, we identify as quartz.    How granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in  outcrops where it forms the bed rock, or country rock, underlying  the loose formations of the surface, and in many parts of the  northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less  decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the  drift. Of the different minerals composing granite, quartz alone  remains unaltered. Mica weathers to detached flakes which have  lost their elasticity. The feldspar crystals have lost their  luster and hardness, and even have decayed to clay. Where long-  weathered granite forms the country rock, it often may be cut with  spade or trowel for several feet from the surface, so rotten is  the feldspar, and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey  soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica.    These are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which  some of the common kinds of rocks undergo. The agencies by which  these changes are brought about we will now take up under two  divisions,--CHEMICAL AGENCIES producing rock decay and MECHANICAL  AGENCIES producing rock disintegration.    THE CHEMICAL WORK OF WATER    As water falls on the earth in rain it has already absorbed from  the air carbon dioxide (carbonic acid gas) and oxygen. As it sinks  into the ground and becomes what is termed ground water, it takes  into solution from the soil humus acids and carbon dioxide, both  of which are constantly being generated there by the decay of  organic matter. So both rain and ground water are charged with  active chemical agents, by the help of which they corrode and rust  and decompose all rocks to a greater or less degree. We notice now  three of the chief chemical processes concerned in weathering,--  solution, the formation of carbonates, and oxidation.    SOLUTION. Limestone, although so little affected by pure water  that five thousand gallons would be needed to dissolve a single  pound, is easily dissolved in water charged with carbon dioxide.  In limestone regions well water is therefore \"hard.\" On boiling  the water for some time the carbon dioxide gas is expelled, the  whole of the lime carbonate can no longer be held in solution, and  much of it is thrown down to form a crust or \"scale\" in the kettle  or in the tubes of the steam boiler. All waters which flow over  limestone rocks or soak through them are constantly engaged in  dissolving them away, and in the course of time destroy beds of  vast extent and great thickness.    The upper surface of limestone rocks becomes deeply pitted, as we  saw in the limestone quarry, and where the mantle of waste has  been removed it may be found so intricately furrowed that it is  difficult to traverse.    Beds of rock salt buried among the strata are dissolved by seeping  water, which issues in salt springs. Gypsum, a mineral composed of  hydrated sulphate of lime, and so soft that it may be scratched  with the finger nail, is readily taken up by water, giving to the  water of wells and springs a peculiar hardness difficult to  remove.    The dissolving action of moisture may be noted on marble  tombstones of some age, marble being a limestone altered by heat  and pressure and composed of crystalline grains. By assuming that  the date on each monument marks the year of its erection, one may  estimate how many years on the average it has taken for weathering  to loosen fine grains on the polished surface, so that they may be  rubbed off with the finger, to destroy the polish, to round the  sharp edges of tool marks in the lettering, and at last to open  cracks and seams and break down the stone. We may notice also  whether the gravestones weather more rapidly on the sunny or the  shady side, and on the sides or on the top.    The weathered surface of granular limestone containing shells  shows them standing in relief. As the shells are made of  crystalline carbonate of lime, we may infer whether the carbonate  of lime is less soluble in its granular or in its crystalline  condition.    THE FORMATION OF CARBONATES. In attacking minerals water does more  than merely take them into solution. It decomposes them, forming  new chemical compounds of which the carbonates are among the most  important. Thus feldspar consists of the insoluble silicate of  alumina, together with certain alkaline silicates which are broken  up by the action of water containing carbon dioxide, forming  alkaline carbonates. These carbonates are freely soluble and  contribute potash and soda to soils and river waters. By the  removal of the soluble ingredients of feldspar there is left the  silicate of alumina, united with water or hydrated, in the  condition of a fine plastic clay which, when white and pure, is  known as KAOLIN and is used in the manufacture of porcelain.  Feldspathic rocks which contain no iron compounds thus weather to  whitish crusts, and even apparently sound crystals of feldspar,  when ground to thin slices and placed under the microscope, may be  seen to be milky in color throughout because an internal change to  kaolin has begun.    OXIDATION. Rocks containing compounds of iron weather to reddish  crusts, and the seams of these rocks are often lined with rusty  films. Oxygen and water have here united with the iron, forming  hydrated iron oxide. The effects of oxidation may be seen in the  alteration of many kinds of rocks and in red and yellow colors of  soils and subsoils.    Pyrite is a very hard mineral of a pale brass color, found in  scattered crystals in many rocks, and is composed of iron and  sulphur (iron sulphide). Under the attack of the weather it takes  up oxygen, forming iron sulphate (green vitriol), a soluble  compound, and insoluble hydrated iron oxide, which as a mineral is  known as limonite. Several large masses of iron sulphide were  placed some years ago on the lawn in front of the National Museum  at Washington. The mineral changed so rapidly to green vitriol  that enough of this poisonous compound was washed into the ground  to kill the roots of the surrounding grass.    AGENTS OF MECHANICAL DISINTEGRATION    HEAT AND COLD. Rocks exposed to the direct rays of the sun become  strongly heated by day and expand. After sunset they rapidly cool  and contract. When the difference in temperature between day and  night is considerable, the repeated strains of sudden expansion  and contraction at last become greater than the rocks can bear,  and they break, for the same reason that a glass cracks when  plunged into boiling water (Fig. 5).    Rocks are poor conductors of heat, and hence their surfaces may  become painfully hot under the full blaze of the sun, while the  interior remains comparatively cool. By day the surface shell  expands and tends to break loose from the mass of the stone. In  cooling in the evening the surface shell suddenly contracts on the  unyielding interior and in time is forced off in scales.    Many rocks, such as granite, are made up of grains of various  minerals which differ in color and in their capacity to absorb  heat, and which therefore contract and expand in different ratios.  In heating and cooling these grains crowd against their"]]]
