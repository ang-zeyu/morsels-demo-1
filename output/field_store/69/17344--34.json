At any rate, the Slavonic races have not been moulded by  the Germanic and Romanic races as these latter have moulded each other:  east and west remain still apart--strangers, if not enemies. Seeing how  deeply rooted Chopin's music is in the national soil, and considering  how little is generally known about Poland and the Poles, the necessity  of paying in this case more attention to the land of the artist's birth  and the people to which he belongs than is usually done in biographies  of artists, will be admitted by all who wish to understand fully and  appreciate rightly the poet-musician and his works. But while taking  note of what is of national origin in Chopin's music, we must be careful  not to ascribe to this origin too much. Indeed, the fact that the  personal individuality of Chopin is as markedly differentiated, as  exclusively self-contained, as the national individuality of Poland,  is oftener overlooked than the master's national descent and its  significance with regard to his artistic production. And now, having  made the reader acquainted with the raison d'etre of this proem, I shall  plunge without further preliminaries in medias res.    The palmy days of Poland came to an end soon after the extinction of  the dynasty of the Jagellons in 1572. So early as 1661 King John Casimir  warned the nobles, whose insubordination and want of solidity, whose  love of outside glitter and tumult, he deplored, that, unless they  remedied the existing evils, reformed their pretended free elections,  and renounced their personal privileges, the noble kingdom would become  the prey of other nations. Nor was this the first warning. The Jesuit  Peter Skarga (1536--1612), an indefatigable denunciator of the vices of  the ruling classes, told them in 1605 that their dissensions would bring  them under the yoke of those who hated them, deprive them of king and  country, drive them into exile, and make them despised by those  who formerly feared and respected them. But these warnings remained  unheeded, and the prophecies were fulfilled to the letter. Elective  kingship, pacta conventa, [Footnote: Terms which a candidate for the  throne had to subscribe on his election. They were of course dictated by  the electors--i.e., by the selfish interest of one class, the szlachta  (nobility), or rather the most powerful of them.] liberum veto,  [Footnote: The right of any member to stop the proceedings of the Diet  by pronouncing the words \"Nie pozwalam\" (I do not permit), or others of  the same import.] degradation of the burgher class, enslavement of  the peasantry, and other devices of an ever-encroaching nobility,  transformed the once powerful and flourishing commonwealth into one  \"lying as if broken-backed on the public highway; a nation anarchic  every fibre of it, and under the feet and hoofs of travelling  neighbours.\" [Footnote: Thomas Carlyle, Frederick the Great, vol.  viii., p. 105.] In the rottenness of the social organism, venality,  unprincipled ambition, and religious intolerance found a congenial soil;  and favoured by and favouring foreign intrigues and interferences, they  bore deadly fruit--confederations, civil wars, Russian occupation of the  country and dominion over king, council, and diet, and the beginning of  the end, the first partition (1772) by which Poland lost a third of her  territory with five millions of inhabitants. Even worse, however, was  to come. For the partitioning powers--Russia, Prussia, and Austria--knew  how by bribes and threats to induce the Diet not only to sanction the  spoliation, but also so to alter the constitution as to enable them to  have a permanent influence over the internal affairs of the Republic.    The Pole Francis Grzymala remarks truly that if instead of some thousand  individuals swaying the destinies of Poland, the whole nation had  enjoyed equal rights, and, instead of being plunged in darkness and  ignorance, the people had been free and consequently capable of feeling  and thinking, the national cause, imperilled by the indolence and  perversity of one part of the citizens, would have been saved by those  who now looked on without giving a sign of life. The \"some thousands\"  here spoken of are of course the nobles, who had grasped all the  political power and almost all the wealth of the nation, and, imitating  the proud language of Louis XIV, could, without exaggeration, have said:  \"L'etat c'est nous.\" As for the king and the commonalty, the one had  been deprived of almost all his prerogatives, and the other had become  a rightless rabble of wretched peasants, impoverished burghers, and  chaffering Jews. Rousseau, in his Considerations sur le gouvernement  de Pologne, says pithily that the three orders of which the Republic  of Poland was composed were not, as had been so often and illogically  stated, the equestrian order, the senate, and the king, but the nobles  who were everything, the burghers who were nothing, and the peasants  who were less than nothing. The nobility of Poland differed from that of  Other countries not only in its supreme political and social position,  but also in its numerousness, character, and internal constitution.    [Footnote: The statistics concerning old Poland are provokingly  contradictory. One authority calculates that the nobility comprised  120,000 families, or one fourteenth of the population (which, before  the first partition, is variously estimated at from fifteen to twenty  millions); another counts only 100,000 families; and a third states  that between 1788 and 1792 (i.e., after the first partition) there were  38,314 families of nobles.]    All nobles were equal in rank, and as every French soldier was said to  carry a marshal's staff in his knapsack, so every Polish noble was born  a candidate for the throne. This equality, however, was rather de jure  than de facto; legal decrees could not fill the chasm which separated  families distinguished by wealth and fame--such as the Sapiehas,  Radziwills, Czartoryskis, Zamoyskis, Potockis, and Branickis--from  obscure noblemen whose possessions amount to no more than \"a few acres  of land, a sword, and a pair of moustaches that extend from one ear to  the other,\" or perhaps amounted only to the last two items. With some  insignificant exceptions, the land not belonging to the state or the  church was in the hands of the nobles, a few of whom had estates of  the extent of principalities. Many of the poorer amongst the nobility  attached themselves to their better-situated brethren, becoming their  dependents and willing tools. The relation of the nobility to the  peasantry is well characterised in a passage of Mickiewicz's epic poem  Pan Tadeusz, where a peasant, on humbly suggesting that the nobility  suffered less from the measures of their foreign rulers than his own  class, is told by one of his betters that this is a silly remark, seeing  that peasants, like eels, are accustomed to being skinned, whereas the  well-born are accustomed to live in liberty.    Nothing illustrates so well the condition of a people as the way in  which justice is administered. In Poland a nobleman was on his  estate prosecutor as well as judge, and could be arrested only after  conviction, or, in the case of high-treason, murder, and robbery, if  taken in the act. And whilst the nobleman enjoyed these high privileges,  the peasant had, as the law terms it, no facultatem standi in judicio,  and his testimony went for nothing in the courts of justice. More than  a hundred laws in the statutes of Poland are said to have been  unfavourable to these poor wretches. In short, the peasant was quite  at the mercy of the privileged class, and his master could do with him  pretty much as he liked, whipping and selling not excepted, nor did  killing cost more than a fine of a few shillings. The peasants on the  state domains and of the clergy were, however, somewhat better off; and  the burghers, too, enjoyed some shreds of their old privileges with more  or less security. If we look for a true and striking description of  the comparative position of the principal classes of the population of  Poland, we find it in these words of a writer of the eighteenth century:  \"Polonia coelum nobilium, paradisus clericorum, infernus rusticorum.\"    The vast plain of Poland, although in many places boggy and sandy, is on  the whole fertile, especially in the flat river valleys, and in the east  at the sources of the Dnieper; indeed, it is so much so that it has been  called the granary of Europe. But as the pleasure-loving gentlemen had  nobler pursuits to attend to, and the miserable peasants, with whom it  was a saying that only what they spent in drink was their own, were not  very anxious to work more and better than they could help, agriculture  was in a very neglected condition. With manufacture and commerce it  stood not a whit better. What little there was, was in the hands of the  Jews and foreigners, the nobles not being allowed to meddle with such  base matters, and the degraded descendants of the industrious and  enterprising ancient burghers having neither the means nor the spirit to  undertake anything of the sort. Hence the strong contrast of wealth and  poverty, luxury and distress, that in every part of Poland, in town and  country, struck so forcibly and painfully all foreign travellers. Of the  Polish provinces that in 1773 came under Prussian rule we read that--       the country people hardly knew such a thing as bread, many     had never in their life tasted such a delicacy; few villages     had an oven. A weaving-loom was rare; the spinning-wheel     unknown."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4974"],[0,"Australia Twice Traversed (#3)"],[1,"explorers upon the terra firma and terra  incognita of our Australian possession, I must begin with the  earliest, and go back a hundred years to the arrival of Governor  Phillip at Botany Bay, in 1788, with eleven ships, which have ever  since been known as \"The First Fleet.\" I am not called upon to narrate  the history of the settlement, but will only say that the Governor  showed sound judgment when he removed his fleet and all his men from  Botany Bay to Port Jackson, and founded the village of Sydney, which  has now become the huge capital city of New South Wales. A new region  was thus opened out for British labour, trade, capital, and  enterprise. From the earliest days of the settlement adventurous and  enterprising men, among whom was the Governor himself, who was on one  occasion speared by the natives, were found willing to venture their  lives in the exploration of the country upon whose shores they had so  lately landed. Wentworth, Blaxland, and Evans appear on the list as  the very first explorers by land. The chief object they had in view  was to surmount the difficulties which opposed their attempting to  cross the Blue Mountains, and Evans was the first who accomplished  this. The first efficient exploring expedition into the interior of  New South Wales was conducted by John Oxley, the Surveyor-General of  the colony, in 1817. His principal discovery was that some of the  Australian streams ran inland, towards the interior, and he traced  both the Macquarie and the Lachlan, named by him after Governor  Lachlan Macquarie, until he supposed they ended in vast swamps or  marshes, and thereby founded the theory that in the centre of  Australia there existed a great inland sea. After Oxley came two  explorers named respectively Hovell and Hume, who penetrated, in 1824,  from the New South Wales settlements into what is now the colony of  Victoria. They discovered the upper portions of the River Murray,  which they crossed somewhere in the neighbourhood of the present town  of Albury. The river was then called the Hume, but it was subsequently  called the Murray by Captain Charles Sturt, who heads the list of  Australia's heroes with the title of The Father of Australian  Exploration.    In 1827 Sturt made one of the greatest discoveries of this century--or  at least one of the most useful for his countrymen--that of the River  Darling, the great western artery of the river system of New South  Wales, and what is now South-western Queensland. In another  expedition, in 1832, Sturt traced the Murrumbidgee River, discovered  by Oxley, in boats into what he called the Murray. This river is the  same found by Hovell and Hume, Sturt's name for it having been  adopted. He entered the new stream, which was lined on either bank by  troops of hostile natives, from whom he had many narrow escapes, and  found it trended for several hundreds of miles in a west-north-west  direction, confirming him in his idea of an inland sea; but at a  certain point, which he called the great north-west bend, it suddenly  turned south and forced its way to the sea at Encounter Bay, where  Flinders met Baudin in 1803. Neither of these explorers appear to have  discovered the river's mouth. On this occasion Sturt discovered the  province or colony of South Australia, which in 1837 was proclaimed by  the British Government, and in that colony Sturt afterwards made his  home.    Sturt's third and final expedition was from the colony of South  Australia into Central Australia, in 1843-1845. This was the first  truly Central Australian expedition that had yet been despatched,  although in 1841 Edward Eyre had attempted the same arduous  enterprise. Of this I shall write anon. On his third expedition Sturt  discovered the Barrier, the Grey, and the Stokes ranges, and among  numerous smaller watercourses he found and named Strezletki's,  Cooper's, and Eyre's Creeks. The latter remained the furthest known  inland water of Australia for many years after Sturt's return. Sturt  was accompanied, as surveyor and draftsman, by John McDouall Stuart,  whom I shall mention in his turn. So far as my opinion, formed in my  wanderings over the greater portions of the country explored by Sturt,  goes, his estimate of the regions he visited has scarcely been borne  out according to the views of the present day.    Like Oxley, he was fully impressed with the notion that an inland sea  did exist, and although he never met such a feature in his travels, he  seems to have thought it must be only a little more remote than the  parts he had reached. He was fully prepared to come upon an inland  sea, for he carried a boat on a bullock waggon for hundreds of miles,  and when he finally abandoned it he writes: \"Here we left the boat  which I had vainly hoped would have ploughed the waters of an inland  sea.\" Several years afterwards I discovered pieces of this boat, built  of New Zealand pine, in the debris of a flood about twenty miles down  the watercourse where it had been left. A great portion, if not all  the country, explored by that expedition is now highly-prized pastoral  land, and a gold field was discovered almost in sight of a depot  formed by Sturt, at a spot where he was imprisoned at a water hole for  six months without moving his camp. He described the whole region as a  desert, and he seems to have been haunted by the notion that he had  got into and was surrounded by a wilderness the like of which no human  being had ever seen or heard of before. His whole narrative is a tale  of suffering and woe, and he says on his map, being at the furthest  point he attained in the interior, about forty-five miles from where  he had encamped on the watercourse he called Eyre's Creek, now a  watering place for stock on a Queensland cattle run: \"Halted at sunset  in a country such as I verily believe has no parallel upon the earth's  surface, and one which was terrible in its aspect.\" Sturt's views are  only to be accounted for by the fact that what we now call excellent  sheep and cattle country appeared to him like a desert, because his  comparisons were made with the best alluvial lands he had left near  the coast. Explorers as a rule, great ones more particularly, are not  without rivals in so honourable a field as that of discovery, although  not every one who undertakes the task is fitted either by nature or  art to adorn the chosen part. Sturt was rivalled by no less celebrated  an individual than Major, afterwards Sir Thomas, Mitchell, a soldier  of the Peninsula War, and some professional jealousy appears to have  existed between them.    Major Mitchell was then the Surveyor-General of the Colony, and he  entirely traversed and made known the region he appropriately named  Australia Felix, now the colony of Victoria. Mitchell, like Sturt,  conducted three expeditions: the first in 1831-1832, when he traced  the River Darling previously discovered by Sturt, for several hundred  miles, until he found it trend directly to the locality at which  Sturt, in his journey down the Murray, had seen and laid down its  mouth or junction with the larger river. Far up the Darling, in  latitude 30 degrees 5', Mitchell built a stockade and formed a depot,  which he called Fort Bourke; near this spot the present town of Bourke  is situated and now connected by rail with Sydney, the distance being  about 560 miles. Mitchell's second journey, when he visited Australia  Felix, was made in 1835, and his last expedition into tropical  Australia was in 1845. On this expedition he discovered a large river  running in a north-westerly direction, and as its channel was so  large, and its general appearance so grand, he conjectured that it  would prove to be the Victoria River of Captain Lort Stokes, and that  it would run on in probably increasing size, or at least in  undiminished magnificence, through the 1100 or 1200 miles of country  that intervened between his own and Captain Stokes's position. He  therefore called it the Victoria River. Gregory subsequently  discovered that Mitchell's Victoria turned south, and was one and the  same watercourse called Cooper's Creek by Sturt. The upper portion of  this watercourse is now known by its native name of the Barcoo, the  name Victoria being ignored. Mitchell always had surveyors with him,  who chained as he went every yard of the thousands of miles he  explored. He was knighted for his explorations, and lived to enjoy the  honour; so indeed was Sturt, but in his case it was only a mockery,  for he was totally blind and almost on his deathbed when the  recognition of his numerous and valuable services was so tardily  conferred upon him. (Dr. W.H. Browne, who accompanied Sturt to Central  Australia in 1843-5 as surgeon and naturalist, is living in London;  and another earlier companion of the Father of Australian Exploration,  George McCleay, still survives.)    These two great travellers were followed by, or worked simultaneously,  although in a totally different part of the continent, namely the  north-west coast, with Sir George Grey in 1837-1839. His labours and  escapes from death by spear-wounds, shipwreck, starvation, thirst, and  fatigue, fill his volumes with incidents of the deepest interest.  Edward Eyre, subsequently known as Governor Eyre, made an attempt to  reach, in 1840-1841, Central Australia by a route north from the city  of Adelaide; and as Sturt imagined himself surrounded by a desert, so  Eyre thought he was hemmed in by a circular or horse-shoe-shaped salt  depression, which he called Lake Torrens; because, wherever he tried  to push northwards, north-westwards, eastwards, or north-eastwards, he  invariably came upon the shores of one of these objectionable and  impassable features. As we now know, there are several of them with  spaces of traversable ground between, instead of the obstacle being  one continuous circle by which he supposed he was surrounded.
