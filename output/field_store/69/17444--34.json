[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6933"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part II: The Jesuits in North America in (#3)"],[1,"have mustered eight thousand fighting men. To speak  further of them is needless, for they were not within the scope of the  Jesuit labors. The heresy of heresies had planted itself among them; and  it was for the apostle Eliot, not the Jesuit, to essay their conversion.  [3]    [3] These Indians, the Armouchiquois of the old French writers, were in  a state of chronic war with the tribes of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.  Champlain, on his voyage of 1603, heard strange accounts of them. The  following is literally rendered from the first narrative of that heroic,  but credulous explorer.    \"They are savages of shape altogether monstrous: for their heads are  small, their bodies short, and their arms thin as a skeleton, as are  also their thighs; but their legs are stout and long, and all of one  size, and, when they are seated on their heels, their knees rise more  than half a foot above their heads, which seems a thing strange and  against Nature. Nevertheless, they are active and bold, and they have  the best country on all the coast towards Acadia.\"--Des Sauvages, f. 34.    This story may match that of the great city of Norembega, on the  Penobscot, with its population of dwarfs, as related by Jean Alphonse.    Landing at Boston, three years before a solitude, let the traveller push  northward, pass the River Piscataqua and the Penacooks, and cross the  River Saco. Here, a change of dialect would indicate a different tribe,  or group of tribes. These were the Abenaquis, found chiefly along the  course of the Kennebec and other rivers, on whose banks they raised  their rude harvests, and whose streams they ascended to hunt the moose  and bear in the forest desert of Northern Maine, or descended to fish in  the neighboring sea. [4]    [4] The Tarratines of New-England writers were the Abenaquis, or a  portion of them.    Crossing the Penobscot, one found a visible descent in the scale of  humanity. Eastern Maine and the whole of New Brunswick were occupied by  a race called Etchemins, to whom agriculture was unknown, though the  sea, prolific of fish, lobsters, and seals, greatly lightened their  miseries. The Souriquois, or Micmacs, of Nova Scotia, closely resembled  them in habits and condition. From Nova Scotia to the St. Lawrence,  there was no population worthy of the name. From the Gulf of St.  Lawrence to Lake Ontario, the southern border of the great river had no  tenants but hunters. Northward, between the St. Lawrence and Hudson's  Bay, roamed the scattered hordes of the Papinachois, Bersiamites, and  others, included by the French under the general name of Montagnais.  When, in spring, the French trading-ships arrived and anchored in the  port of Tadoussac, they gathered from far and near, toiling painfully  through the desolation of forests, mustering by hundreds at the point of  traffic, and setting up their bark wigwams along the strand of that wild  harbor. They were of the lowest Algonquin type. Their ordinary  sustenance was derived from the chase; though often, goaded by deadly  famine, they would subsist on roots, the bark and buds of trees, or the  foulest offal; and in extremity, even cannibalism was not rare among  them.    Ascending the St. Lawrence, it was seldom that the sight of a human form  gave relief to the loneliness, until, at Quebec, the roar of Champlain's  cannon from the verge of the cliff announced that the savage prologue of  the American drama was drawing to a close, and that the civilization of  Europe was advancing on the scene. Ascending farther, all was solitude,  except at Three Rivers, a noted place of trade, where a few Algonquins  of the tribe called Atticamegues might possibly be seen. The fear of the  Iroquois was everywhere; and as the voyager passed some wooded point, or  thicket-covered island, the whistling of a stone-headed arrow  proclaimed, perhaps, the presence of these fierce marauders. At Montreal  there was no human life, save during a brief space in early summer, when  the shore swarmed with savages, who had come to the yearly trade from  the great communities of the interior. To-day there were dances, songs,  and feastings; to-morrow all again was solitude, and the Ottawa was  covered with the canoes of the returning warriors.    Along this stream, a main route of traffic, the silence of the  wilderness was broken only by the splash of the passing paddle. To the  north of the river there was indeed a small Algonquin band, called La  Petite Nation, together with one or two other feeble communities; but  they dwelt far from the banks, through fear of the ubiquitous Iroquois.  It was nearly three hundred miles, by the windings of the stream, before  one reached that Algonquin tribe, La Nation de l'Isle, who occupied the  great island of the Allumettes. Then, after many a day of lonely travel,  the voyager found a savage welcome among the Nipissings, on the lake  which bears their name; and then circling west and south for a hundred  and fifty miles of solitude, he reached for the first time a people  speaking a dialect of the Iroquois tongue. Here all was changed.  Populous towns, rude fortifications, and an extensive, though barbarous  tillage, indicated a people far in advance of the famished wanderers of  the Saguenay, or their less abject kindred of New England. These were  the Hurons, of whom the modern Wyandots are a remnant. Both in  themselves and as a type of their generic stock they demand more than a  passing notice. [5]    [5] The usual confusion of Indian tribal names prevails in the case of  the Hurons. The following are their synonymes:--    Hurons (of French origin); Ochateguins (Champlain); Attigouantans (the  name of one of their tribes, used by Champlain for the whole nation);  Ouendat (their true name, according to Lalemant); Yendat, Wyandot,  Guyandot (corruptions of the preceding); Ouaouakecinatouek (Potier),  Quatogies (Colden).      THE HURONS.    More than two centuries have elapsed since the Hurons vanished from  their ancient seats, and the settlers of this rude solitude stand  perplexed and wondering over the relics of a lost people. In the damp  shadow of what seems a virgin forest, the axe and plough bring strange  secrets to light: huge pits, close packed with skeletons and disjointed  bones, mixed with weapons, copper kettles, beads, and trinkets. Not even  the straggling Algonquins, who linger about the scene of Huron  prosperity, can tell their origin. Yet, on ancient worm-eaten pages,  between covers of begrimed parchment, the daily life of this ruined  community, its firesides, its festivals, its funeral rites, are painted  with a minute and vivid fidelity.    The ancient country of the Hurons is now the northern and eastern  portion of Simcoe County, Canada West, and is embraced within the  peninsula formed by the Nottawassaga and Matchedash Bays of Lake Huron,  the River Severn, and Lake Simcoe. Its area was small,--its population  comparatively large. In the year 1639 the Jesuits made an enumeration of  all its villages, dwellings, and families. The result showed thirty-two  villages and hamlets, with seven hundred dwellings, about four thousand  families, and twelve thousand adult persons, or a total population of at  least twenty thousand. [6]    [6] Lalemant, Relation des Hurons, 1640, 38 (Cramoisy). His words are,  \"de feux enuiron deux mille, et enuiron douze mille personnes.\" There  were two families to every fire. That by \"personnes\" adults only are  meant cannot be doubted, as the Relations abound in incidental evidence  of a total population far exceeding twelve thousand. A Huron family  usually numbered from five to eight persons. The number of the Huron  towns changed from year to year. Champlain and Le Caron, in 1615,  reckoned them at seventeen or eighteen, with a population of about ten  thousand, meaning, no doubt, adults. BrÃ©beuf, in 1635, found twenty  villages, and, as he thinks, thirty thousand souls. Both Le Mercier and  De Quen, as well as Dollier de Casson and the anonymous author of the  Relation of 1660, state the population at from thirty to thirty-five  thousand. Since the time of Champlain's visit, various kindred tribes or  fragments of tribes had been incorporated with the Hurons, thus more  than balancing the ravages of a pestilence which had decimated them.    The region whose boundaries we have given was an alternation of meadows  and deep forests, interlaced with footpaths leading from town to town.  Of these towns, some were fortified, but the greater number were open  and defenceless. They were of a construction common to all tribes of  Iroquois lineage, and peculiar to them. Nothing similar exists at the  present day. [7] They covered a space of from one to ten acres, the  dwellings clustering together with little or no pretension to order. In  general, these singular structures were about thirty or thirty-five feet  in length, breadth, and height; but many were much larger, and a few  were of prodigious length. In some of the villages there were dwellings  two hundred and forty feet long, though in breadth and height they did  not much exceed the others. [8] In shape they were much like an arbor  overarching a garden-walk. Their frame was of tall and strong saplings,  planted in a double row to form the two sides of the house, bent till  they met, and lashed together at the top. To these other poles were  bound transversely, and the whole was covered with large sheets of the  bark of the oak, elm, spruce, or white cedar, overlapping like the  shingles of a roof, upon which, for their better security, split poles  were made fast with cords of linden bark. At the crown of the arch,  along the entire length of the house, an opening a foot wide was left  for the admission of light and the escape of smoke. At each end was a  close porch of similar construction; and here were stowed casks of bark,  filled with smoked fish, Indian corn, and other stores not liable to  injury "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6934"],[0,"The Radio Amateur's Hand Book (#3)"],[1,"Telephone Transmitter--With Direct Current Motor  Generator--A 50- to 100-mile Wireless Telephone Transmitting Set--With  100-volt Alternating Current--The Apparatus You Need--The Vacuum Tube  Rectifier--The Filter Condensers--The Filter Reactance Coil--  Connecting Up the Apparatus--A 100- to 200-mile Wireless Telephone  Transmitting Set--With 110-volt Alternating Current--Apparatus  Required.
