[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7766"],[0,"A Dog of Flanders (#3)"],[1,"  bare lands looked very bleak and drear without, and sometimes within the  floor was flooded and then frozen. In winter it was hard, and the snow  numbed the little white limbs of Nello, and the icicles cut the brave,  untiring feet of Patrasche.    But even then they were never heard to lament, either of them. The  child's wooden shoes and the dog's four legs would trot manfully  together over the frozen fields to the chime of the bells on the  harness; and then sometimes, in the streets of Antwerp, some housewife  would bring them a bowl of soup and a handful of bread, or some kindly  trader would throw some billets of fuel into the little cart as it went  homeward, or some woman in their own village would bid them keep a share  of the milk they carried for their own food; and they would run over  the white lands, through the early darkness, bright and happy, and burst  with a shout of joy into their home.    So, on the whole, it was well with them, very well; and Patrasche,  meeting on the highway or in the public streets the many dogs who toiled  from daybreak into nightfall, paid only with blows and curses, and  loosened from the shafts with a kick to starve and freeze as best they  might--Patrasche in his heart was very grateful to his fate, and thought  it the fairest and the kindliest the world could hold. Though he was  often very hungry indeed when he lay down at night; though he had to  work in the heats of summer noons and the rasping chills of winter  dawns; though his feet were often tender with wounds from the sharp  edges of the jagged pavement; though he had to perform tasks beyond his  strength and against his nature--yet he was grateful and content: he did  his duty with each day, and the eyes that he loved smiled down on him.  It was sufficient for Patrasche.    [Illustration]    There was only one thing which caused Patrasche any uneasiness in his  life, and it was this. Antwerp, as all the world knows, is full at every  turn of old piles of stones, dark and ancient and majestic, standing  in crooked courts, jammed against gateways and taverns, rising by the  water's edge, with bells ringing above them in the air, and ever and  again out of their arched doors a swell of music pealing. There they  remain, the grand old sanctuaries of the past, shut in amidst the  squalor, the hurry, the crowds, the unloveliness, and the commerce of  the modern world, and all day long the clouds drift and the birds circle  and the winds sigh around them, and beneath the earth at their feet  there sleeps--RUBENS.    And the greatness of the mighty Master still rests upon Antwerp, and  wherever we turn in its narrow streets his glory lies therein, so that  all mean things are thereby transfigured; and as we pace slowly through  the winding ways, and by the edge of the stagnant water, and through the  noisome courts, his spirit abides with us, and the heroic beauty of his  visions is about us, and the stones that once felt his footsteps and  bore his shadow seem to arise and speak of him with living voices. For  the city which is the tomb of Rubens still lives to us through him, and  him alone.    It is so quiet there by that great white sepulchre--so quiet, save only  when the organ peals and the choir cries aloud the Salve Regina or the  Kyrie Eleison. Sure no artist ever had a greater gravestone than that  pure marble sanctuary gives to him in the heart of his birthplace in the  chancel of St. Jacques.    Without Rubens, what were Antwerp? A dirty, dusky, bustling mart, which  no man would ever care to look upon save the traders who do business on  its wharves. With Rubens, to the whole world of men it is a sacred name,  a sacred soil, a Bethlehem where a god of Art saw light, a Golgotha  where a god of Art lies dead.    O nations! closely should you treasure your great men, for by them alone  will the future know of you. Flanders in her generations has been wise.  In his life she glorified this greatest of her sons, and in his death  she magnifies his name. But her wisdom is very rare.    Now, the trouble of Patrasche was this. Into these great, sad piles of  stones, that reared their melancholy majesty above the crowded roofs,  the child Nello would many and many a time enter, and disappear through  their dark arched portals, whilst Patrasche, left without upon the  pavement, would wearily and vainly ponder on what could be the charm  which thus allured from him his inseparable and beloved companion. Once  or twice he did essay to see for himself, clattering up the steps with  his milk-cart behind him; but thereon he had been always sent back again  summarily by a tall custodian in black clothes and silver chains of  office; and fearful of bringing his little master into trouble, he  desisted, and remained couched patiently before the churches until such  time as the boy reappeared. It was not the fact of his going into them  which disturbed Patrasche: he knew that people went to church: all  the village went to the small, tumbledown, gray pile opposite the red  windmill.    What troubled him was that little Nello always looked strangely when  he came out, always very flushed or very pale; and whenever he returned  home after such visitations would sit silent and dreaming, not caring to  play, but gazing out at the evening skies beyond the line of the canal,  very subdued and almost sad.    What was it? wondered Patrasche. He thought it could not be good or  natural for the little lad to be so grave, and in his dumb fashion he  tried all he could to keep Nello by him in the sunny fields or in the  busy market-place. But to the churches Nello would go: most often of all  would he go to the great cathedral; and Patrasche, left without on the  stones by the iron fragments of Quentin Matsys's gate, would stretch  himself and yawn and sigh, and even howl now and then, all in vain,  until the doors closed and the child perforce came forth again, and  winding his arms about the dog's neck would kiss him on his broad,  tawney-colored forehead, and murmur always the same words: \"If I could  only see them, Patrasche!--if I could only see them!\"    What were they? pondered Patrasche, looking up with large, wistful,  sympathetic eyes.    One day, when the custodian was out of the way and the doors left ajar,  he got in for a moment after his little friend and saw. \"They\" were two  great covered pictures on either side of the choir.    Nello was kneeling, rapt as in an ecstasy, before the altar-picture of  the Assumption, and when he noticed Patrasche, and rose and drew the dog  gently out into the air, his face was wet with tears, and he looked up  at the veiled places as he passed them, and murmured to his companion,  \"It is so terrible not to see them, Patrasche, just because one is poor  and cannot pay! He never meant that the poor should not see them when  he painted them, I am sure. He would have had us see them any day, every  day: that I am sure. And they keep them shrouded there--shrouded in the  dark, the beautiful things!--and they never feel the light, and no eyes  look on them, unless rich people come and pay. If I could only see them,  I would be content to die.\"    But he could not see them, and Patrasche could not help him, for to gain  the silver piece that the church exacts as the price for looking on the  glories of the Elevation of the Cross and the Descent of the Cross was  a thing as utterly beyond the powers of either of them as it would have  been to scale the heights of the cathedral spire. They had never so much  as a sou to spare: if they cleared enough to get a little wood for the  stove, a little broth for the pot, it was the utmost they could do.  And yet the heart of the child was set in sore and endless longing upon  beholding the greatness of the two veiled Rubens.    [Illustration: tree] [Illustration: scenery]    The whole soul of the little Ardennois thrilled and stirred with an  absorbing passion for Art. Going on his ways through the old city in  the early days before the sun or the people had risen, Nello, who looked  only a little peasant-boy, with a great dog drawing milk to sell from  door to door, was in a heaven of dreams whereof Rubens was the god.  Nello, cold and hungry, with stockingless feet in wooden shoes, and the  winter winds blowing among his curls and lifting his poor thin garments,  was in a rapture of meditation, wherein all that he saw was the  beautiful fair face of the Mary of the Assumption, with the waves of her  golden hair lying upon her shoulders, and the light of an eternal sun  shining down upon her brow. Nello, reared in poverty, and buffeted  by fortune, and untaught in letters, and unheeded by men, had the  compensation or the curse which is called Genius.    No one knew it. He as little as any. No one knew it. Only indeed  Patrasche, who, being with him always, saw him draw with chalk upon  the stones any and every thing that grew or breathed, heard him on his  little bed of hay murmur all manner of timid, pathetic prayers to the  spirit of the great Master; watched his gaze darken and his face radiate  at the evening glow of sunset or the rosy rising of the dawn; and felt  many and many a time the tears of a strange, nameless pain and joy,  mingled together, fall hotly from the bright young eyes upon his own  wrinkled yellow forehead.    \"I should go to my grave quite content if I thought, Nello, that when  thou growest a man thou couldst own this hut and the little plot of  ground, and labor for thyself, and be called Baas by thy neighbors,\"  said the old man Jehan many an hour from his bed. For to own a bit of  soil, and to be called Baas--master--by the hamlet round, is to have  achieved the highest ideal of a Flemish peasant; and the old soldier,  who had wandered over all the earth in his youth, and had brought  nothing back, deemed in his old age that to live and die on one spot in  contented humility was the fairest fate he could desire"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7777"],[0,"Narrative of the Voyages Round the World, Performed (#3)"],[1,"chart, it is  sufficient to say, that it hath never since been found necessary to  publish any other. One, which has appeared in France, is only a copy  of our author's, on a reduced scale.    After the expedition at Quebec, Mr. Cook, by warrant from Lord  Colvill, was appointed, on the 22d of September, 1759, master of the  Northumberland man of war, the ship in which his lordship staid, in  the following winter, as commodore, with the command of a squadron at  Halifax. In this station, Mr. Cook's behaviour did not fail to gain  him the esteem and friendship of his commander. During the leisure,  which the season of winter afforded him, he employed his time in the  acquisition of such knowledge as eminently qualified him for future  service. It was at Halifax that he first read Euclid, and applied  himself to the study of astronomy and other branches of science. The  books of which he had the assistance were few in number: but his  industry enabled him to supply many defects, and to make a progress  far superior to what could be expected from the advantages he enjoyed.    While Mr. Cook was master of the Northumberland under Lord Colvill,  that ship came to Newfoundland in September, 1762, to assist in the  recapture of the island from the French, by the forces under the  command of Lieutenant-colonel Amherst. When the island was recovered,  the English fleet staid some days at Placentia, in order to put it in  a more complete state of defence. During this time Mr. Cook manifested  a diligence in surveying the harbour and heights of the place, which  arrested the notice of Captain (now Admiral) Graves, commander of the  Antelope, and governor of Newfoundland. The governor was hence induced  to ask Cook a variety of questions, from the answers to which he was  led to entertain a very favourable opinion of his abilities. This  opinion was increased, the more he saw of Mr. Cook's conduct; who,  wherever they went, continued to display the most unremitting  attention to every object that related to the knowledge of the coast,  and was calculated to facilitate the practice of navigation. The  esteem which Captain Graves had conceived for him was confirmed by the  testimonies to his character, that were given by all the officers  under whom he served.    In the latter end of 1762, Mr. Cook returned to England; and, on the  21st of December, in the same year married, at Barking in Essex, Miss  Elizabeth Batts, an amiable and deserving woman, who was justly  entitled to and enjoyed his tenderest regard and affection. But his  station in life, and the high duties to which he was called, did not  permit him to partake of matrimonial felicity, without many and very  long interruptions.    Early in the year 1763, after the peace with France and Spain was  concluded, it was determined that Captain Graves should go out again,  as governor of Newfoundland As the country was very valuable in a  commercial view, and had been an object of great contention between  the English and the French, the captain obtained an establishment for  the survey of its coasts; which, however, he procured with some  difficulty, because the matter was not sufficiently understood by  government at home. In considering the execution of the plan, Mr. Cook  appeared to Captain Graves to be a proper person for the purpose; and  proposals were made to him, to which, notwithstanding his recent  marriage, he readily and prudently acceded. Accordingly, he went out  with the Captain as surveyor; and was first employed to survey  Miquelon and St. Pierre, which had been ceded by the treaty to the  French, who, by order of administration, were to take possession of  them at a certain period, even though the English commander should not  happen to be arrived in the country. When Captain Graves had reached  that part of the world, he found there the governor who had been sent  from France (Mons. D'Anjac), with all the settlers and his own family,  on board a frigate and some transports. It was contrived, however, to  keep them in that disagreeable situation for a whole month, which was  the time taken by Mr. Cook to complete his survey. When the business  was finished, the French were put into possession of the two islands,  and left in the quiet enjoyment of them, with every profession of  civility.    At the end of the season, Mr. Cook returned to England, but did not  long continue at home. In the beginning of the year 1764, his old and  constant friend and patron, Sir Hugh Palliser, was appointed governor  and commodore of Newfoundland and Labradore; upon which occasion he  was glad to take Mr. Cook with him, in the same capacity that he had  sustained under Captain Graves. Indeed, no man could have been found  who was better qualified for finishing the design which had been begun  in the preceding year. The charts of the coasts, in that part of North  America were very erroneous; and it was highly necessary to the trade  and navigation of his majesty's subjects, that new ones should be  formed, which would be more correct and useful. Accordingly, under the  orders of Commodore Palliser, Mr. Cook was appointed on the 18th of  April, 1764, marine surveyor of Newfoundland and Labradore; and he had  a vessel, the Grenville schooner, to attend him for that purpose. How  well he executed his commission is known to every man acquainted with  navigation. The charts which he afterward published of the different  surveys he had made, reflected great credit on his abilities and  character, and the utility of them is universally acknowledged. It is  understood, that, so far as Newfoundland is concerned they were of  considerable service to the king's ministers, in settling the terms of  the last peace. Mr. Cook explored the inland parts of this island in a  much completer manner than had ever been done before. By penetrating  further into the middle of the country than any man had hitherto  attempted, he discovered several large lakes, which are indicated upon  the general chart. In these services Mr. Cook appears to have been  employed, with the intervals of occasionally returning to England for  the winter season, till the year 1767, which was the last time that he  went out upon his station of marine surveyor of Newfoundland. It must  not be omitted, that, while he occupied this post, he had an  opportunity of exhibiting to the Royal Society a proof of his progress  in the study of astronomy. A short paper was written by him, and  inserted in the fifty-seventh volume of the Philosophical  Transactions, entitled, 'An Observation of an Eclipse of the Sun at  the Island of Newfoundland, August 5, 1766, with the Longitude of the  place of Observation deduced from it.' The observation was made at one  of the Burgeo islands, near Cape Ray, in latitude 47 deg. 36' 19\", on the  south-west extremity of Newfoundland. Mr. Cook's paper having been  communicated by Dr. Bevis to Mr. Witchell, the latter gentleman  compared it with an observation at Oxford, by the Rev. Mr. Hornsby, on  the same eclipse, and thence computed the difference of longitude  respecting the places of observation, making due allowance for the  effect of parallax, and the prolate spheroidal figure of the earth. It  appears from the Transactions that our navigator had already obtained  the character of being an able mathematician.          CHAPTER II.    Narrative of Captain Cook's first voyage round the world.      There is scarcely any thing from which the natural curiosity of man  receives a higher gratification, than from the accounts of distant  countries and nations. Nor is it curiosity only that is gratified by  such accounts; for the sphere of human knowledge is hereby enlarged,  and various objects are brought into view, an acquaintance with which  greatly contributes to the improvement of life and the benefit of the  world. With regard to information of this kind, the moderns have  eminently the advantage over the ancients. The ancients could neither  pursue their enquiries with the same accuracy, nor carry them on to  the same extent. Travelling by land was much more inconvenient and  dangerous than it hath been in later times; and, as navigation was  principally confined to coasting, it must necessarily have been  circumscribed within very narrow limits.    The invention of the compass, seconded by the ardent and enterprising  spirit of several able men, was followed by wonderful discoveries.  Vasco di Gama doubled the Cape of Good Hope; and a new way being thus  found out to the East Indies, the countries to that part of the earth  became more accurately and extensively known. Another world was  discovered by Columbus; and, at length, Magalhaens accomplished the  arduous and hitherto unattempted task of sailing round the globe. At  different periods he was succeeded by other circumnavigators, of whom  it is no part of the present narrative to give an account.    The spirit of discovery, which was so vigorous during the latter end  of the fifteenth and through the whole of the sixteenth century,  began, soon after the commencement of the seventeenth century, to  decline. Great navigations were only occasionally undertaken, and more  from the immediate views of avarice or war, than from any noble and  generous principles. But of late years they have been revived, with  the enlarged and benevolent design of promoting the happiness of the  human species.    A beginning of this kind was made in the reign of George the Second,  during which two voyages were performed; the first under the command  of Captain Middleton, and the next under the direction of Captains  Smith and More, in order to discover a northwest passage through  Hudson's Bay. It was reserved, however, for the glory of the present  reign to carry the spirit of discovery to its height, and to conduct  it on the noblest principles; not for the purposes of covetuousness or  ambition; not to plunder or destroy the inhabitants of"]]]
