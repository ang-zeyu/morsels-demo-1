As Mr. Hampden paused in the doorway:    \"Good morning,\" said the girl, glancing down at the card which lay upon  the desk before her. \"You come from Mr. Isaacs, eh?\"    She looked at him with a caressing glance from beneath half-lowered  lashes, but missed no detail of his appearance. She did not quite like  his moustache, and thought that he would have looked better cleanshaven.  Nevertheless, he was a well-set-up fellow, and her manner evidenced  approval.    \"Yes,\" he replied, smiling genially. \"I have a small commission to  execute, and I am told that you can help me.\"    The girl paused for a moment, and then:    \"Yes, very likely,\" she said, speaking good English but with an odd  intonation. \"It is not jade? We have very little jade.\"    \"No, no. I wanted an enamelled casket.\"    \"What kind?\"    \"Cloisonne.\"    \"Cloisonne? Yes, we have several.\"    She pressed a bell, and, glancing up at the boy who had stood throughout  the interview at the visitor's elbow, addressed him rapidly in Chinese.  He nodded his head and led the way through a second doorway. Closing  this, he opened a third and ushered Mr. Hampden into a room which nearly  caused the latter to gasp with astonishment.    One who had blundered from Whitechapel into the Khan Khalil, who had  been transported upon a magic carpet from a tube station to the Taj  Mahal, or dropped suddenly upon Lebanon hills to find himself looking  down upon the pearly domes and jewelled gardens of Damascus, could not  well have been more surprised. This great treasure-house of old Huang  Chow was one of Chinatown's secrets--a secret shared only by those whose  commercial interests were identical with the interests of Huang Chow.    The place was artificially lighted by lamps which themselves were  beautiful objects of art, and which swung from the massive beams of  the ceiling. The floor of the warehouse, which was partly of stone, was  covered with thick matting, and spread upon it were rugs and carpets  of Karadagh, Kermanshah, Sultan-abad, and Khorassan, with lesser-known  loomings of almost equal beauty. Skins of rare beasts overlay the  divans. Furniture of ivory, of ebony and lemonwood, preciously inlaid,  gave to the place an air of cunning confusion. There were tall cabinets,  there were caskets and chests of exquisite lacquer and enamel, loot  of an emperor's palace; robes heavy with gold; slippers studded with  jewels; strange carven ivories; glittering weapons; pots, jars, and  bowls, as delicate and as fragile as the petals of a lily.    Last, but not least, sitting cross-legged upon a low couch, was old  Huang Chow, smoking a great curved pipe, and peering half blindly across  the place through large horn-rimmed spectacles. This couch was set  immediately beside a wide ascending staircase, richly carpeted, and  on the other side of the staircase, in a corresponding recess, upon a  gilded trestle carved to represent the four claws of a dragon, rested  perhaps the strangest exhibit of that strange collection--a Chinese  coffin of exquisite workmanship.    The boy retired, and Mr. Hampden found himself alone with Huang Chow. No  word had been exchanged between master and servant, but:    \"Good morning, Mr. Hampden,\" said the Chinaman in a high, thin voice.  \"Please be seated. It is from Mr. Isaacs you come?\"          IV    PERSONAL REPORT OF DETECTIVE JOHN DURHAM TO CHIEF INSPECTOR KERRY,  OFFICER IN CHARGE OF LIMEHOUSE INQUIRY        Dear Chief Inspector,--Following your instructions I returned and  interviewed the prisoner Poland in his cell. I took the line which  you had suggested, pointing out to him that he had nothing to gain and  everything to lose by keeping silent.    \"Answer my questions,\" I said, \"and you can walk straight out.  Otherwise, you'll be up before the magistrate, and on your record alone  it will mean a holiday which you probably don't want.\"    He was very truculent, but I got him in a good humour at last, and he  admitted that he had been cooperating with the dead man, Cohen, in an  attempt to burgle the house of Huang Chow. His reluctance to go into  details seemed to be due rather to fear of Huang Chow than to fear of  the law, and I presently gathered that he regarded Huang as responsible  for the death not only of Cohen, but also of the Chinaman who was  hauled out of the river about three weeks ago, as you well remember. The  post-mortem showed that he had died of some kind of poisoning, and when  we saw Cohen in the mortuary, his swollen appearance struck me as being  very similar to that of the Chinaman. (See my report dated 31st ultimo.)    He finally agreed to talk if I would promise that he should not be  charged and that his name should never be mentioned to anyone in  connection with what he might tell me. I promised him that outside the  ordinary official routine I would respect his request, and he told me  some very curious things, which no doubt have a bearing on the case.    For instance, he had discovered--I don't know in what way--that the dead  Chinaman, whose name was Pi Lung, had been in negotiation with Huang  Chow for some sort of job in his warehouse. Poland had seen the man  talking to Huang's daughter, at the end of the alley which leads to the  place. He seemed to attach extraordinary importance to this fact. At  last:    \"I'll tell you what it is,\" he said. \"That Chink was a stranger to  Limehouse; I can swear to it. He was a gent of his hands; I reckon  they've got 'em in China as well as here. He went out for the old boy's  money-box, and finished like Cohen finished.\"    \"Make your meaning clearer,\" I said.    \"My meaning's this: Old Huang Chow is the biggest dealer in stolen and  smuggled valuables from overseas we've got in London. He's something  else as well; he's a big swell in China. But here's the point. He's  got business with buyers all over London, and they have to pay cash--no  checks. He doesn't bank it: I've proved that. He's got it in gold, or  diamonds, or something, being wise to present conditions, hidden there  in the house. Pi Lung was after his hoard. He didn't get it. Cohen and  me was after it. Where's Cohen?\"    I agreed that it looked very suspicious, and presently:    \"When I went in with Cohen,\" continued Poland, \"I knew one thing  he didn't know--a short cut into the warehouse. He's been playing  pretty-like with Lala, old Huang's daughter, and it's my belief that  he knew where the store was hidden; but he never told me. We knew there  were special men on duty, and we'd arranged that I was to give a signal  when the patrol had passed. Cohen all the time had planned to double on  me. While I was watching down on the Causeway end he climbed up and got  in through the skylight I'd shown him. When I got there he was missing,  but the skylight was open. I started off after him.\"    Then Poland clutched me, and his fright was very real.    \"I heard a shriek like nothing I ever heard in my life. I saw a light  shine through the trap, and then I heard a sort of moaning. Last, I  heard a bang, and the light went out. I staggered down the passage half  silly, started to run, and ran straight into the arms of two coppers.\"    This evidence I thought was conclusive, and in accordance with your  instructions I proceeded to Mr. Isaacs in Dover Street. He didn't seem  too pleased at my suggestion, but when I pointed out to him that one  good turn deserved another, he agreed to give me an introduction to  Huang Chow.    I adopted a very simple disguise, just altering my complexion and  sticking on a moustache with spirit gum, hair by hair, and trimming it  down military fashion. Everything ran smoothly, and I seemed to make a  fairly favourable impression upon Lala Huang, the Chinaman's daughter,  who evidently interviews prospective customers before they are admitted  to the warehouse.    She is a Eurasian and extremely good looking. But when I found myself  in the room where old Huang keeps his treasures, I really thought I was  dreaming. It's a collection that must be worth thousands. He showed me  snuff-bottles, cut out of gems, and with a little opening no bigger than  the hole in a pipe-stem, but with wonderful paintings done inside the  bottles. He'd got a model of a pagoda made out of human teeth, and a big  golden rug woven from the hair of Circassian slave girls. Excuse this,  Chief Inspector; I know it is what you call the romantic stuff; but I  think it would have impressed you if you had seen it.    Anyway, I bought a little enamelled box, in accordance with Mr. Isaacs's  instructions, although whether I succeeded in convincing Huang Chow that  I knew anything about the matter is more than doubtful. He got up from  a sort of throne he sits on, and led the way up a broad staircase to a  private room above.    \"Of course, you have brought the cash, Mr. Hampden?\" he said.    He speaks quite faultless English. He walked up three steps to a sort of  raised writing-table in this upstairs room, and I counted out the  money to him. When he sat at the table he faced toward the room, and I  couldn't help thinking that, in his horn-rimmed spectacles, he looked  like some old magistrate. He explained that he would pack the purchase  for me, but that I must personally take it away. And:    \"You understand,\" said he, \"that you bought it from a gentleman who had  purchased it abroad.\"    I said I quite understood. He bowed me out very politely, and presently  I found myself back in the office with Lala Huang.    She seemed quite disposed to talk, and I chatted with her while the box  was being packed for me to take away. I knew I must make good use of my  time, but you have never given me a job I liked less. I mean, there  is something very appealing about her, and I hated to think that I was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/571"],[0,"The 1995 CIA World Factbook (#3)"],[1,"and anxiety and  include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,  phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone  (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,  Valmid). Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical,  mental, emotional, or behavioral change in an individual. Drug abuse  is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results in  physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an  individual. Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,  self-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid,  microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine  variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog),  phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin,  psilocyn).  Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant  (Cannabis sativa).  Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.  Mandrax is the Southwest Asian slang term for methaqualone, a  pharmaceutical depressant.  Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis  sativa).  Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, in slang referred to as  Quaaludes in North America or Mandrax in Southwest Asia Narcotics are  drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium, opium  derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include  opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),  codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC),  and thebaine.

Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year  old in a given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same year.    International disputes: This category includes a wide variety of  situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to  unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding  disputes over international boundaries and maritime boundaries has  been reviewed by the Department of State. References to other  situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such  as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues.  However, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance  or recognition by the US Government.    Irrigated land: The figure refers to the land area that is  artificially supplied with water.    Land use: The land surface is categorized as arable land - land  cultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat,  maize, rice); permanent crops - land cultivated for crops that are not  replanted after each harvest (citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and  pastures - land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops; forest  and woodland - under dense or open stands of trees; and other - any  land type not specifically mentioned above (urban areas, roads,  desert).    Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who  represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but is not  involved with the day- to-day activities of the government. The head  of government is the administrative leader who manages the day-to-day  activities of the government. In the UK, the monarch is the chief of  state, and the Prime Minister is the head of government. In the US,  the President is both the chief of state and the head of government.    Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a  group of people all born in the same year, if mortality at each age  remains constant in the future.    Literacy: There are no universal definitions and standards of  literacy. Unless otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most  common definition - the ability to read and write at a specified age.  Detailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the  ability to read and write is beyond the scope of this publication.    Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some  national claims from being extended the full distance.    Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All  commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which  excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc. Also, a  grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register.  Captive register - A register of ships maintained by a territory,  possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships  owned in the parent country; also referred to as an offshore register,  the offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive  register will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local  variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation  rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a captive  register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent  country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned  abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience  register, except that it is not the register of an independent state.  Flag of convenience register - A national register offering  registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major  flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue  of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal  manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having  relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag  state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a  given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority  of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an  open register.  Flag state - The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds  legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or  abroad. Flag state maritime legislation determines how a ship is  manned and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the  register.  Internal register - A register of ships maintained as a subset of a  national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national  flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of  maritime rules from those on the main national register. These  differences usually include lower taxation of profits, manning by  foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag state  (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International  Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most  notable examples of an internal register. Both have been instrumental  in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and  in attracting foreign owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags.  Merchant ship - A vessel that carries goods against payment of  freight; commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately  restricted to commercial vessels only.  Register - The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed  with the maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of  such individual ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides  it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country  in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the nationality of  the ship's ultimate owner.    Money figures: All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US  dollars unless otherwise indicated.    National product: The total output of goods and services in a country  in a given year. See GDP methodology, Gross domestic product (GDP),  and Gross national product (GNP).    Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons entering  and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on  midyear population). An excess of persons entering the country is  referred to as net immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an  excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration (-9.26  migrants/1,000 population).    Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based  on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration  systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on  assumptions about future trends. Starting with the 1993 Factbook,  demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have taken  into account the effects of the growing incidence of AIDS infections;  in 1993 these countries were Burkina, Burundi, Central African  Republic, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania,  Uganda, Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Thailand, Brazil, and Haiti.    Telephone numbers: All telephone numbers presented in the Factbook  consist of the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where  required) in parentheses, and the local number. The one component that  is not presented is the international access code which varies from  country to country. For example, an international direct dial phone  call placed from the United States to Madrid, Spain, would be as  follows:        011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where      011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls   "]]]
