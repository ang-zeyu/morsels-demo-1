Moreover, seely [Footnote: Simple, weak.] creature as thou art, who  hath limited the end of thy daies? Happily thou presumest upon  physitians reports. Rather consider the effect and experience. By  the common course of things long since thou livest by extraordinarie  favour. Thou hast alreadie over-past the ordinarie tearmes of common  life: And to prove it, remember but thy acquaintances, and tell me  how many more of them have died before they came to thy age, than  have either attained or outgone the same: yea, and of those that  through renoune have ennobled their life, if thou but register them,  I will lay a wager, I will finde more that have died before they  came to five and thirty years, than after. It is consonant with  reason and pietie, to take example by the humanity of Jesus Christ,  who ended his humane life at three and thirtie yeares. The greatest  man that ever was, being no more than a man, I meane Alexander the  Great, ended his dayes, and died also of that age. How many severall  meanes and waies hath death to surprise us!         Quid quisque vitet, nunquam homini satis       Cautum est in horas       [Footnote: Hor. 1. ii. Od. xiii. 13.]         A man can never take good heed,       Hourely what he may shun and speed.    I omit to speak of agues and pleurisies; who would ever have  imagined that a Duke of Brittanie should have beene stifled to death  in a throng of people, as whilome was a neighbour of mine at Lyons,  when Pope Clement made his entrance there? Hast thou not seene one  of our late Kings slaine in the middest of his sports? and one of  his ancestors die miserably by the chocke [Footnote: Shock.] of an  hog? Eschilus fore threatned by the fall of an house, when he stood  most upon his guard, strucken dead by the fall of a tortoise shell,  which fell out of the tallants of an eagle flying in the air? and  another choaked with the kernell of a grape? And an Emperour die by  the scratch of a combe, whilest he was combing his head? And  Aemylius Lepidus with hitting his foot against a doore-seele? And  Aufidius with stumbling against the Consull-chamber doore as he was  going in thereat? And Cornelius Gallus, the Praetor, Tigillinus,  Captaine of the Romane watch, Lodowike, sonne of Guido Gonzaga,  Marquis of Mantua, end their daies betweene womens thighs? And of a  farre worse example Speusippus, the Platonian philosopher, and one  of our Popes? Poore Bebius a Judge, whilest he demurreth the sute of  a plaintife but for eight daies, be hold, his last expired: And  Caius Iulius a Physitian, whilest he was annointing the eies of one  of his patients, to have his owne sight closed for ever by death.  And if amongst these examples, I may adde one of a brother of mine,  called Captain Saint Martin, a man of three and twentie yeares of  age, who had alreadie given good testimonie of his worth and forward  valour, playing at tennis, received a blow with a ball, that hit him  a little above the right eare, without apparance of any contusion,  bruse, or hurt, and never sitting or resting upon it, died within  six houres after of an apoplexie, which the blow of the ball caused  in him. These so frequent and ordinary examples, hapning, and being  still before our eies, how is it possible for man to forgo or for  get the remembrance of death? and why should it not continually  seeme unto us, that shee is still ready at hand to take us by the  throat? What matter is it, will you say unto me, how and in what  manner it is, so long as a man doe not trouble and vex himselfe  therewith? I am of this opinion, that howsoever a man may shrowd or  hide himselfe from her dart, yea, were it under an oxe-hide, I am  not the man would shrinke backe: it sufficeth me to live at my ease;  and the best recreation I can have, that doe I ever take; in other  matters, as little vain glorious, and exemplare as you list.       --praetulerim delirus inersque videri,       Dum mea delectent mala me, vel denique fallant,       Quam sapere et ringi       [Footnote: Hor. 1. ii. Episi. ii 126]         A dotard I had rather seeme, and dull,       Sooner my faults may please make me a gull,       Than to be wise, and beat my vexed scull.    But it is folly to thinke that way to come unto it. They come, they  goe, they trot, they daunce: but no speech of death. All that is  good sport. But if she be once come, and on a sudden and openly  surprise, either them, their wives, their children, or their  friends, what torments, what out cries, what rage, and what despaire  doth then overwhelme them? saw you ever anything so drooping, so  changed, and so distracted? A man must looke to it, and in better  times fore-see it. And might that brutish carelessenesse lodge in  the minde of a man of understanding (which I find altogether  impossible) she sels us her ware at an overdeere rate: were she an  enemie by mans wit to be avoided, I would advise men to borrow the  weapons of cowardlinesse: but since it may not be, and that be you  either a coward or a runaway, an honest or valiant man, she  overtakes you,         Nempe et fugacem persequitur virum,       Nec parcit imbellis juventae       Poplitibus, timidoque tergo.       [Footnote: Hor. 1. iii. Od. ii. 14.]         Shee persecutes the man that flies,       Shee spares not weake youth to surprise,       But on their hammes and backe turn'd plies.    And that no temper of cuirace [Footnote: Cuirass.] may shield or  defend you,         Ille licet ferro cauius se condat et aere,       Mors tamen inclusum protraket inde caput.       [Footnote: Propert. 1. iii. et xvii. 5]         Though he with yron and brasse his head empale,       Yet death his head enclosed thence will hale.    Let us learne to stand, and combat her with a resolute minde. And  being to take the greatest advantage she hath upon us from her, let  us take a cleane contrary way from the common, let us remove her  strangenesse from her, let us converse, frequent, and acquaint our  selves with her, let us have nothing so much in minde as death, let  us at all times and seasons, and in the ugliest manner that may be,  yea with all faces shapen and represent the same unto our  imagination. At the stumbling of a horse, at the fall of a stone, at  the least prick with a pinne, let us presently ruminate and say with  our selves, what if it were death it selfe? and thereupon let us  take heart of grace, and call our wits together to confront her.  Amiddest our bankets, feasts, and pleasures, let us ever have this  restraint or object before us, that is, the remembrance of our  condition, and let not pleasure so much mislead or transport us,  that we altogether neglect or forget, how many waies, our joyes, or  our feastings, be subject unto death, and by how many hold-fasts  shee threatens us and them. So did the AEgyptians, who in the  middest of their banquetings, and in the full of their greatest  cheere, caused the anatomie [Footnote: Skeleton] of a dead man to be  brought before them, as a memorandum and warning to their guests.         Omnem crede diem tibi diluxisse supremum,       Grata superveniet; quae non sperabitur, hora?       [Footnote: Hor. 1. i. Epist. iv. 13.]         Thinke every day shines on thee as thy last,       Welcome it will come, whereof hope was past.    It is uncertaine where death looks for us; let us expect her everie  where: the premeditation of death, is a forethinking of libertie. He  who hath learned to die, hath unlearned to serve. There is no evill  in life, for him that hath well conceived, how the privation of life  is no evill. To know how to die, doth free us from all subjection  and constraint. Paulus AEmilius answered one, whom that miserable  king of Macedon his prisoner sent to entreat him he would not lead  him in triumph, \"Let him make that request unto himselfe.\" Verily,  if Nature afford not some helpe in all things, it is very hard that  art and industrie should goe farre before. Of my selfe, I am not  much given to melancholy, but rather to dreaming and sluggishness.  There is nothing wherewith I have ever more entertained my selfe,  than with the imaginations of death, yea in the most licentious  times of my age.         Iucundum, cum atas florida ver ageret       [Footnote: Catul. Eleg. iv. 16.]         When my age flourishing       Did spend its pleasant spring.    Being amongst faire Ladies, and in earnest play, some have thought  me busied, or musing with my selfe, how to digest some jealousie, or  meditating on the uncertaintie of some conceived hope, when God he  knowes, I was entertaining my selfe with the remembrance of some one  or other, that but few daies before was taken with a burning fever,  and of his sodaine end, comming from such a feast or meeting where I  was my selfe, and with his head full of idle conceits, of lore, and  merry glee; supposing the same, either sickness or end, to be as  neere me as him.        Iam fuerit, nec post, unquam revocare licebit.      [Footnote: Lucr. I. iii. 947.]        Now time would be, no more You can this time restore.    I did no more trouble my selfe or frowne at such conceit, [Idea.]  than at any other. It is impossible we should not apprehend or feele  some motions or startings at such imaginations at the first, and  comming sodainely upon us; but doubtlesse, he that shall manage and  meditate upon them with an impartiall eye, they will assuredly, in  tract [Course.] of time, become familiar to him: Otherwise, for my  part, I should be in continuall feare and agonie; for no man did  ever more distrust his life, nor make lesse account of his  continuance: Neither can health, which hitherto I have so long  enjoied, and which so seldome hath beene crazed, [Enfeebled.]  lengthen my hopes, nor any sicknesse shorten them of it. At every  minute me thinkes I make an escape. And I uncessantly record unto my  selfe, that whatsoever may be done another day, may be effected this  day.

Secondly, we have seen, that though man did transgress, his  transgression did not deprive him of the previous knowledge with which  he was endowed, relative to the existence and glory of his Creator; for  no sooner did he hear his voice, than he sought to hide himself from  his presence.    20. Having shown, then, in the first instance, that God began to  converse with man, immediately after he \"breathed into his nostrils the  breath of life,\" and that he did not cease to manifest himself to him,  even after his fall, we shall next proceed to show, that, though he was  cast out from the garden of Eden, his knowledge of the existence of God  was not lost, neither did God cease to manifest his will unto him.    21. We next proceed to present the account of the direct revelation  which man received, after he was cast out of Eden, and further copy  from the New Translation:    22. After Adam had been driven out of the garden, he began to till the  earth, and to have dominion over all the beasts of the field, and to  eat his bread by the sweat of his brow, as I the Lord had commanded  him: and he called upon the name of the Lord, and so did Eve his wife  also. And they heard the voice of the Lord from the way toward the  garden of Eden, speaking unto them; and they saw him not, for they were  shut out from his presence; and he gave unto them commandments that  they should worship the Lord their God, and should offer the firstlings  of their flocks for an offering unto the Lord. And Adam was obedient  unto the commandments of the Lord.    23. And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam,  saying, Why do you offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto  him, I know not; but the Lord commanded me to offer sacrifices.    24. And then the angel said unto him, This thing is a similitude of the  sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, who is full of grace and  truth. And you shall do all that you do in the name of the Son: and you  shall repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forever. And in  that day the Holy Ghost fell upon Adam, and bore record of the Father  and the Son.    25. This last quotation, or summary, shows this important fact, that  though our first parents were driven out of the garden of Eden, and  were even separated from the presence of God, by a vail, they still  retained a knowledge of his existence, and that sufficiently to move  them to call upon him. And further, that no sooner was the plan of  redemption revealed to man, and he began to call upon God, than the  Holy Spirit was given, bearing record of the Father and Son.    26. Moses also gives us an account, in the 4th of Genesis, of the  transgression of Cain, and the righteousness of Abel, and of the  revelations of God to them. He says: In process of time, Cain brought  of the fruit of the ground, an offering unto the Lord.--And Abel also  brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof. And the  Lord had respect unto Abel, and to his offering: but unto Cain and to  his offering he had not respect. Now Satan knew this, and it pleased  him. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. And the Lord  said unto Cain, Why are you angry? Why is your countenance fallen? If  you do well, will you not be accepted?--And if you do not well, sin  lieth at the door, and Satan desires to have you; and except you shall  hearken unto my commandments, I will deliver you up: and it shall be  unto you according to his desire.    27. And Cain went into the field, and talked with his brother Abel. And  while they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel,  and slew him. And Cain gloried in what he had done, saying, I am free;  surely the flocks of my brother will now fall into my hands.    28. But the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel, your brother? And he  said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper? And the Lord said, What  have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries unto me from the  ground. And now, you shall be cursed from the earth which hath opened  her mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. When you till  the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto you her strength. A  fugitive and a vagabond you shall be in the earth.    29. And Cain said unto the Lord, Satan tempted me because of my  brother's flocks. And I was angry: for his offering you accepted and  mine was not: My punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold you have  driven me out this day from the face of men, and from your face shall  I be hid also; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth;  and it shall come to pass that he that findeth me will slay me because  of mine iniquities, for these things are not hid from the Lord. And the  Lord said unto him, Therefore, whoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be  taken on him seven fold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any  finding him should kill him.    30. The object of the foregoing quotations is to show to this class  the way by which mankind were first made acquainted with the existence  of a God: that it was by a manifestation of God to man, and that God  continued, after man's transgression to manifest himself to him and  to his posterity; and, notwithstanding they were separated from his  immediate presence, that they could not see his face, they continued to  hear his voice.    31. Adam thus being made acquainted with God, communicated the  knowledge which he had unto his posterity; and it was through this  means that the thought was first suggested to their minds that there  was a God. Which laid the foundation for the exercise of their faith,  through which they could obtain a knowledge of his character and also  of his glory.    32. Not only was there a manifestation made unto Adam of the existence  of a God, but Moses informs us, as before quoted, that God condescended  to talk with Cain after his great transgression, in slaying his  brother, and that Cain knew that it was the Lord that was talking with  him: so that when he was driven out from the presence of his brethren,  he carried with him the knowledge of the existence of a God; and,  through this means, doubtless, his posterity became acquainted with the  fact that such a being existed.    33. From this we can see that the whole human family, in the early age  of their existence, in all their different branches, had this knowledge  disseminated among them; so that the existence of God became an object  of faith, in the early age of the world. And the evidences which these  men had of the existence of a God, was the testimony of their fathers  in the first instance.    34. The reason why we have been thus particular on this part of our  subject, is that this class may see by what means it was that God  became an object of faith among men after the fall; and what it was  that stirred up the faith of multitudes to feel after him; to search  after a knowledge of his character, perfections and attributes, until  they became extensively acquainted with him; and not only commune with  him, and behold his glory, but be partakers of his power and stand in  his presence.    35. Let this class mark particularly that the testimony which these men  had of the existence of a God, was the testimony of man; for previous  to the time that any of Adam's posterity had obtained a manifestation  of God to themselves, Adam their common father had testified unto them  of the existence of God, and of his eternal power and Godhead.    36. For instance, Abel, before he received the assurance from heaven  that his offerings were acceptable unto God, had received the important  information of his father that such a being did exist, who had created  and who did uphold all things. Neither can there be a doubt existing  on the mind of any person, that Adam was the first who did communicate  the knowledge of the existence of a God, to his posterity; and that  the whole faith of the world, from that time down to the present, is  in a certain degree, dependent on the knowledge first communicated to  them by their common progenitor; and it has been handed down to the day  and generation in which we live, as we shall show from the face of the  sacred records.    37. First, Adam was 130 years old when Seth was born. Genesis 5:3. And  the days of Adam, after he had begotten Seth, were 800 years; making  him 930 years old when he died. Genesis 5:4,5. Seth was 105 when Enos  was born. 5:6. Enos was 90 when Cainan was born. 5:9. Cainan was 70  when Mahalaleel was born. 5:12. Mahalaleel was 65 when Jared was born.  5:15. Jared was 162 when Enoch was born. 5:18. Enoch was 65 when  Methuselah was born. 5:21. Methuselah was 187 when Lamech was born.  5:25. Lamech was 182 when Noah was born. 5:28.    38. From this account it appears that Lamech, the 9th from Adam, and  the father of Noah, was 56 years old when Adam died; Methuselah, 243;  Enoch, 308; Jared, 470; Mahalaleel, 535; Cainan, 605; Enos, 695; and  Seth, 800.    39. So that Lamech the father of Noah; Methuselah, Enoch, Jared,  Mahalaleel, Cainan, Enos, Seth, and Adam, were all living at the same  time, and beyond all controversy, were all preachers of righteousness.    40. Moses further informs us, that Seth lived, after he begat Enos,  807 years, making him 912 years old at his death. Genesis 5:7,8. And  Enos lived, after he begat Cainan, 815 years, making him 905 years old  when he died. 5:10,11. And Cainan lived, after he begat Mahalaleel, 840  years: making him 910 years old at his death. 5:13,14. And Mahalaleel  lived after he begat Jared, 830 years, making him 895 years old when he  died. 5:16,17. And Jared lived after he begat Enoch, 800 years, making  him 962 years old at his death. 5:19,20. And Enoch walked with God,  after he begat Methuselah 300 years:"]]]
