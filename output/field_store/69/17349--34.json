[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],[0,"Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#3)"],[1,"to the second edition  of his lecture on \"The Mormons\" he says, page 86:        \"The Mormons as I saw them, though a majority, were but a portion      of the Church as it flourished in Illinois. When the persecution      triumphed there, and no alternative remained for the steadfast in      the faith but the flight out of Egypt into the wilderness, as it      was termed, all their fair weather friends forsook them.\" * * * * *        \"So the Mormons have been as it were, broken and screened by      calamity. Their designing leaders have left them to seek after      fortunes elsewhere. Those that remain of the old stock are the      masses, always honest in the main and sincere even in delusion; and      their guides are a few tried and trusty men, little initiated in      the plotting of synagogues, and more noted for services rendered      than bounties received. They are the men whom I saw on the prairie      trail, sharing sorrow with the sorrowful, and poverty with the      poor; the chief of them all, a man of rare natural endowment, to      whose masterly guidance they are mainly indebted for their present      prosperity, driving his own ox team and carrying his sick child in      his arms.\"    We have the statement of Sidney Rigdon, one of those who forsook the  cause. It is found in his Messenger and Advocate for June, 1846, pages  474-5, and a portion of his statement I will now read:        \"Their camp [that is the camp of the exiles, the pioneers] is in      the western part of Iowa, some 200 miles west of Nauvoo. Their      situation according to our informant, is as miserable as it well      could be. Their stock of provisions they took with them, is getting      fast reduced, so much so, that they can proceed no further; neither      can they go back. They are there without shelter, other than tents      and wagons, and their tents so indifferent that they will not shed      the rain, which has been incessantly falling since their arrival.      In this awful condition is to be found the aged and infirm, the      mother and tender infant. When our informant left, they were      going to fence in some 300 or 400 acres of land, for the purpose      of raising a crop of corn to try and preserve life. The remains      of their furniture, which in part consists of beds and bedding,      they are sending off to Missouri to exchange for corn and bacon to      sustain life. * * * * This said Young professed to be a follower      of Christ, and hold communion with Him, and to receive revelations      from Him; but where are his pretensions now? He has got, according      to our informant, some 800 or 1,000 people far into the wilds,      without food, without shelter, and himself being judge, without      object. * * * A state of wretchedness beyond this is not easily      conceived of. Our informant says when he left, which was some three      weeks since [and I may add that it is quite evident from this      account why he left] the mud, by reason of the incessant rains, was      six inches deep round their camp.\"    I suppose that there are some present this afternoon who realize the  hardships through which the pioneers had to pass that tried men's souls  and that only the faithful were able to endure.    I have now shown that the great majority of the Latter-day Saints  followed President Brigham Young and were true to the Church. We get a  good idea of the number who scattered from the testimony of William W.  Blair.      FEW JOINED REORGANITES.    Of the members of the Church who were in fellowship in 1844-6, the  \"Reorganized\" Church has received no more, and likely less than 1,000  converts, which fact shows that the apostasy was not so great in 1844-6  as has been stated by the Senator from Michigan and members of the  \"Reorganization.\" This statement is based on the testimony of William  W. Blair, one of the original members of the \"Reorganized\" Church, as  he testified before the United States court of appeals for the Western  district of Missouri, in 1894, in the temple lot suit, which was for  the possession of property in the hands of the \"Church of Christ,\" or  \"Hedrickites.\"    Before that court Mr. Blair, who was for many years a member of the  presidency of the \"Reorganized\" Church, testified that \"1,000 was  probably too high an estimate for the members of the original Church,  that had joined the 'Reorganized' Church.\" He could \"approximately  say,\" that 1,000 had joined the \"Reorganized\" Church, and \"possibly  that estimate was too large.\" (Record pp. 180, 181).      ORIGIN OF \"REORGANIZED\" CHURCH.    We will now consider the origin of this \"Reorganized\" Church. Many  people have been lead to believe that this society had its origin at  the martyrdom, or immediately following the martyrdom. But this is not  the fact. Properly it did not come into existence until 1860--16 years  after the martyrdom, but the two men who were mainly responsible for  the organization commenced their work in 1852-3. These men were Jason  W. Briggs and Zenas H. Gurley. Perhaps a brief outline of their lives  would be interesting.    Jason W. Briggs who was really the founder of the \"Reorganized\" Church,  or, who perhaps did more than any other one man to bring about that  sect, was born June 25, 1821, at Pompey, Onondaga county, N. Y. It is  said he joined the Church at Potosi, Wis., about 1841, but most of the  history of this man we get through the records of the \"reorganization.\"  His home was at Beloit, Wis., from 1842 to 1854.[3] He remained with  the Church under the leadership of President Young and the Twelve until  the year 1846 (Reorg. Hist., 3:737). It is interesting to note in this  regard that the exodus commenced February 4, 1846, so we are quite safe  in saying that this man was one of \"the fair weather friends.\"    After the exodus he joined James J. Strang, and in his organization  labored in the ministry quite extensively (Reorganite History 3; 737),  filling short missions to various parts of New York and in Wisconsin.    In September of 1849, with B. G. Wright, he organized the Waukesha  branch of Mr. Strang's church (Hist. Reorganized Church, 3; 737-8).  Now, remember this was in September, 1849, and the organization of  this branch was in the Strangite church. About this same time he also  organized the Beloit branch for the same organization.[4]    In 1850 he left Mr. Strang's organization and joined with William  Smith, who had himself been a follower of Mr. Strang until  excommunicated from that organization. In William Smith's church Mr.  Briggs accepted the position of \"apostle;\" but at the time of the  disintegration of William Smith's church in 1851, he withdrew, and in  1852 joined with Zenas H. Gurley. These two men then organized what  was called at the time the \"New Organization of the Church,\" but today  known as the \"Reorganized\" Church.    In 1886, together with the family of Zenas H. Gurley,[5] Mr. Briggs  withdrew from the \"Reorganization,\" which he had begotten. (Saints'  Herald, 33; 248-9). His reasons for withdrawing we will consider later.    Zenas H. Gurley was more active in the Church previous to the  martyrdom. He was ordained a Seventy in Nauvoo in 1844, and when the  Twenty-first quorum of Seventy was organized, April 6, 1845, he was  chosen as the senior president, he being the oldest of the presidents  chosen. He was a native of New York state, born May 29, 1801, and was  therefore 43 years of age in 1844.    We know something about this man's career between the martyrdom and the  exodus from the minutes of this quorum of Seventy. And as this record  contains some very interesting items I will read a few of them here. In  the minutes of November 2, 1845, we read:        \"President Zenas H. Gurley apologized for his absence the two last      meetings. He then enlarged upon the subject (i. e., the subject      before the quorum). He said he had received the assurance of      an addition of power of the Priesthood upon every accession of      authority he had received. We ought to be the best men living in      consideration of our privileges as members of the Church of Jesus      Christ of Latter-day Saints, enlightened as it was with divine      revelation, He exhorted the brethren not to aspire but to rise upon      their own merits and to visit the poor in their afflictions.\"    In the minutes of November 9, we are informed that President Erastus H.  Derby, one of the presidents of that quorum, said:        \"Brother Brigham advised and counseled the Saints to get ready for      emigration in May, 1846. If he (Derby) possessed the wealth of the      whole nation he would not stay behind the Church going into the      wilderness.\"    Immediately following these remarks, Zenas H. Gurley arose and said, as  the minutes read, that \"He confirmed the same.\" That is, he too would  rather forsake the wealth of the whole nation than fail to go with the  Church into the wilderness. Then continuing his remarks, he said:        \"Small prototypes of great national events were given by command      of God, by the ancient prophets, and the like would probably      nowadays distinguish what God is about to do in the earth. * * *      Certain characters have been elected from before time to fulfill      certain purposes in the earth, called though they were from all      nations, tongues, and ranks. * * * The order of free masonry was      outrageously violated by the people of Hancock; but the pledges,      obligations and vows of the Latter-day Saints would, if adhered to,      exalt them to thrones dominions and power.\"    This was in relation to temple work. On the 21st of December, 1845, he  said:        \"He remembered forcibly the sayings of the first presidents of      Seventy, that we should so live that no charge can be brought      against us. A few years ago the men in high standing in this      Church (the Twelve) were as little as we are. They obtained "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5039"],[0,"State of the Union Addresses (#3)"],[1,"   It will be the continuing policy of the United States to use all its  influence to foster, support, and develop the United Nations Organization  in its purpose of preventing international war. If peace is to endure it  must rest upon justice no less than upon power. The question is how justice  among nations is best achieved. We know from day-to-day experience that the  chance for a just solution is immeasurably increased when everyone directly  interested is given a voice. That does not mean that each must enjoy an  equal voice, but it does mean that each must be heard.    Last November, Prime Minister Attlee, Prime Minister MacKenzie King, and I  announced our proposal that a commission be established within the  framework of the United Nations to explore the problems of effective  international control of atomic energy.    The Soviet Union, France, and China have joined us in the purpose of  introducing in the General Assembly a resolution for the establishment of  such a commission. Our earnest wish is that the work of this commission go  forward carefully and thoroughly, but with the greatest dispatch. I have  great hope for the development of mutually effective safeguards which will  permit the fullest international control of this new atomic force.    I believe it possible that effective means can be developed through the  United Nations Organization to prohibit, outlaw, and prevent the use of  atomic energy for destructive purposes.    The power which the United States demonstrated during the war is the fact  that underlies every phase of our relations with other countries. We cannot  escape the responsibility which it thrusts upon us. What we think, plan,  say, and do is of profound significance to the future of every corner of  the world.    The great and dominant objective of United States foreign policy is to  build and preserve a just peace. The peace we seek is not peace for twenty  years. It is permanent peace. At a time when massive changes are occurring  with lightning speed throughout the world, it is often difficult to  perceive how this central objective is best served in one isolated complex  situation or another. Despite this very real difficulty, there are certain  basic propositions to which the United States adheres and to which we shall  continue to adhere.    One proposition is that lasting peace requires genuine understanding and  active cooperation among the most powerful nations. Another is that even  the support of the strongest nations cannot guarantee a peace unless it is  infused with the quality of justice for all nations.    On October 27, 1945, I made, in New York City, the following public  statement of my understanding of the fundamental foreign policy of the  United States. I believe that policy to be in accord with the opinion of  the Congress and of the people of the United States. I believe that that  policy carries out our fundamental objectives.    1. We seek no territorial expansion or selfish advantage. We have no plans  for aggression against any other state, large or small. We have no  objective which need clash with the peaceful aims of any other nation.    2. We believe in the eventual return of sovereign rights and  self-government to all peoples who have been deprived of them by force.    3. We shall approve no territorial changes in any friendly part of the  world unless they accord with the freely expressed wishes of the people  concerned.    4. We believe that all peoples who are prepared for self-government should  be permitted to choose their own form of government by their own freely  expressed choice, without interference from any foreign source. That is  true in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, as well as in the Western Hemisphere.    5. By the combined and cooperative action of our war allies, we shall help  the defeated enemy states establish peaceful democratic governments of  their own free choice. And we shall try to attain a world in which nazism,  fascism, and military aggression cannot exist.    6. We shall refuse to recognize any government imposed upon any nation by  the force of any foreign power. In some cases it may be impossible to  prevent forceful imposition of such a government. But the United States  will not recognize any such government.    7. We believe that all nations should have the freedom of the seas and  equal rights to the navigation of boundary rivers and waterways and of  rivers and waterways which pass through more than one country.    8. We believe that all states which are accepted in the society of nations  should have access on equal terms to the trade and the raw materials of the  world.    9. We believe that the sovereign states of the Western Hemisphere, without  interference from outside the Western Hemisphere, must work together as  good neighbors in the solution of their common problems.    10. We believe that full economic collaboration between all nations, great  and small, is essential to the improvement of living conditions all over  the world, and to the establishment of freedom from fear and freedom from  want.    11. We shall continue to strive to promote freedom of expression and  freedom of religion throughout the peace-loving areas of the world.    12. We are convinced that the preservation of peace between nations  requires a United Nations Organization composed of all the peace-loving  nations of the world who are willing jointly to use force, if necessary, to  insure peace.    That is our foreign policy.    We may not always fully succeed in our objectives. There may be instances  where the attainment of those objectives is delayed. But we will not give  our full sanction and approval to actions which fly in the face of these  ideals.    The world has a great stake in the political and economic future of  Germany. The Allied Control Council has now been in operation there for a  substantial period of time. It has not met with unqualified success. The  accommodation of varying views of four governments in the day-to-day civil  administration of occupied territory is a challenging task. In my judgment,  however, the Council has made encouraging progress in the face of most  serious difficulties. It is my purpose at the earliest practicable date to  transfer from military to civilian personnel the execution of United States  participation in the government of occupied territory in Europe. We are  determined that effective control shall be maintained in Germany until we  are satisfied that the German people have regained the right to a place of  honor and respect.    On the other side of the world, a method of international cooperation has  recently been agreed upon for the treatment of Japan. In this pattern of  control, the United States, with the full approval of its partners, has  retained primary authority and primary responsibility. It will continue to  do so until the Japanese people, by their own freely expressed choice,  choose their own form of government.    Our basic policy in the Far East is to encourage the development of a  strong, independent, united, and democratic China. That has been the  traditional policy of the United States.    At Moscow the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and  Great Britain agreed to further this development by supporting the efforts  of the national government and nongovernmental Chinese political elements  in bringing about cessation of civil strife and in broadening the basis of  representation in the Government. That is the policy which General Marshall  is so ably executing today.    It is the purpose of the Government of the United States to proceed as  rapidly as is practicable toward the restoration of the sovereignty of  Korea and the establishment of a democratic government by the free choice  of the people of Korea.    At the threshold of every problem which confronts us today in international  affairs is the appalling devastation, hunger, sickness, and pervasive human  misery that mark so many areas of the world.    By joining and participating in the work of the United Nations Relief and  Rehabilitation Administration the United States has directly recognized and  assumed an obligation to give such relief assistance as is practicable to  millions of innocent and helpless victims of the war. The Congress has  earned the gratitude of the world by generous financial contributions to  the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.    We have taken the lead, modest though it is, in facilitating under our  existing immigration quotas the admission to the United States of refugees  and displaced persons from Europe.    We have joined with Great Britain in the organization of a commission to  study the problem of Palestine. The Commission is already at work and its  recommendations will be made at an early date.    The members of the United Nations have paid us the high compliment of  choosing the United States as the site of the United Nations headquarters.  We shall be host in spirit as well as in fact, for nowhere does there abide  a fiercer determination that this peace shall live than in the hearts of  the American people.    It is the hope of all Americans that in time future historians will speak  not of World War I and World War II, but of the first and last world wars.    2. FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLICY    The foreign economic policy of the United States is designed to promote our  own prosperity, and at the same time to aid in the restoration and  expansion of world markets and to contribute thereby to world peace and  world security. We shall continue our efforts to provide relief from the  devastation of war, to alleviate the sufferings of displaced persons, to  assist in reconstruction and development, and to promote the expansion of  world trade.    We have already joined the International Monetary Fund and the  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. We have expanded the  Export-Import Bank and "]]]
