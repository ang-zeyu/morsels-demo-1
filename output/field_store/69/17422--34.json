[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6440"],[0,"Elsie Dinsmore (#3)"],[1,"little Elsie possessed; the same regular features, pure  complexion, and sweet smile.    Miss Allison gazed at it a moment in silent admiration; then turning  from it to the child with a puzzled expression, she said, \"But, Elsie,  I do not understand; are you not sister to Enna and the rest, and is  not Mrs. Dinsmore own mother to them all?\"    \"Yes, ma'am, to all of them, but not to me nor my papa. Their brother  Horace is my papa, and so they are all my aunts and uncles.\"    \"Indeed,\" said the lady, musingly; \"I thought you looked very unlike  the rest. And your papa is away, is he not, Elsie?\"    \"Yes, ma'am; he is in Europe. He has been away almost ever since I was  born, and I have never seen him. Oh! how I do wish he would come home!  how I long to see him! Do you think he would love me, Miss Allison? Do  you think he would take me on his knee and pet me, as grandpa does  Enna?\"    \"I should think he would, dear; I don't know how he could help loving  his own dear little girl,\" said the lady, again kissing the little rosy  cheek. \"But now,\" she added, rising, \"I must go away and let you learn  your lesson.\"    Then taking up the little Bible, and turning over the leaves, she  asked, \"Would you like to come to my room sometimes in the mornings and  evenings, and read this book with me, Elsie?\"    \"Oh! yes, ma'am, dearly!\" exclaimed the child, her eyes sparkling with  pleasure.    \"Come then this evening, if you like; and now goodbye for the present.\"  And pressing another kiss on the child's cheek, she left her and went  back to her own room, where she found her friend Adelaide Dinsmore, a  young lady near her own age, and the eldest daughter of the family.  Adelaide was seated on a sofa, busily employed with some fancy work.    \"You see I am making myself quite at home,\" she said, looking up as  Rose entered. \"I cannot imagine where you have been all this time.\"    \"Can you not? In the school-room, talking with little Elsie. Do you  know, Adelaide, I thought she was your sister; but she tells me not.\"    \"No, she is Horace's child. I supposed you knew; but if you do not, I  may just as well tell you the whole story. Horace was a very wild boy,  petted and spoiled, and always used to having his own way; and when he  was about seventeen--quite a forward youth he was too--he must needs go  to New Orleans to spend some months with a schoolmate; and there he  met, and fell desperately in love with, a very beautiful girl a year or  two younger than himself, an orphan and very wealthy. Fearing that  objections would be made on the score of their youth, etc., etc., he  persuaded her to consent to a private marriage, and they had been man  and wife for some months before either her friends or his suspected it.    \"Well, when it came at last to papa's ears, he was very angry, both on  account of their extreme youth, and because, as Elsie Grayson's father  had made all his money by trade, he did not consider her quite my  brother's equal; so he called Horace home and sent him North to  college. Then he studied law, and since that he has been traveling in  foreign lands. But to return to his wife; it seems that her guardian  was quite as much opposed to the match as papa; and the poor girl was  made to believe that she should never see her husband again. All their  letters were intercepted, and finally she was told that he was dead;  so, as Aunt Chloe says, 'she grew thin and pale, and weak and  melancholy,' and while the little Elsie was yet not quite a week old,  she died. We never saw her; she died in her guardian's house, and there  the little Elsie stayed in charge of Aunt Chloe, who was an old servant  in the family, and had nursed her mother before her, and of the  housekeeper, Mrs. Murray, a pious old Scotch woman, until about four  years ago, when her guardian's death broke up the family, and then they  came to us. Horace never comes home, and does not seem to care for his  child, for he never mentions her in his letters, except when it is  necessary in the way of business.\"    \"She is a dear little thing,\" said Rose. \"I am sure he could not help  loving her, if he could only see her.\"    \"Oh! yes, she is well enough, and I often feel sorry for the lonely  little thing, but the truth is, I believe we are a little jealous of  her; she is so extremely beautiful, and heiress to such an immense  fortune. Mamma often frets, and says that one of these days she will  quite eclipse her younger daughters.\"    \"But then,\" said Rose, \"she is almost as near; her own grand-daughter.\"    \"No, she is not so very near,\" replied Adelaide, \"for Horace is not  mamma's son. He was seven or eight years old when she married papa, and  I think she was never particularly fond of him.\"    \"Ah! yes,\" thought Rose, \"that explains it. Poor little Elsie! No  wonder you pine for your father's love, and grieve over the loss of the  mother you never knew!\"    \"She is an odd child,\" said Adelaide; \"I don't understand her; she is  so meek and patient she will fairly let you trample upon her. It  provokes papa. He says she is no Dinsmore, or she would know how to  stand up for her own rights; and yet she has a temper, I know, for once  in a great while it shows itself for an instant--only an instant,  though, and at very long intervals--and then she grieves over it for  days, as though she had committed some great crime; while the rest of  us think nothing of getting angry half a dozen times in a day. And then  she is forever poring over that little Bible of hers; what she sees so  attractive in it I'm sure I cannot tell, for I must say I find it the  dullest of dull books.\"    \"Do you,\" said Rose; \"how strange! I had rather give up all other books  than that one. 'Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage forever, for  they are the rejoicing of my heart,' 'How sweet are thy words unto my  taste! Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth.'\"    \"Do you _really_ love it so, Rose?\" asked Adelaide, lifting her eyes to  her friend's face with an expression of astonishment; \"do tell me why?\"    \"For its exceeding great and precious promises Adelaide; for its holy  teachings; for its offers of peace and pardon and eternal life. I am a  sinner, Adelaide, lost, ruined, helpless, hopeless, and the Bible  brings me the glad news of salvation offered as a free, unmerited gift;  it tells me that Jesus died to save sinners--just such sinners as I. I  find that I have a heart deceitful above all things and desperately  wicked, and the blessed Bible tells me how that heart can be renewed,  and where I can obtain that holiness without which no man shall see the  Lord. I find myself utterly unable to keep God's holy law, and it tells  me of One who has kept it for me. I find that I deserve the wrath and  curse of a justly offended God, and it tells me of Him who was made a  curse for me. I find that all my righteousnesses are as filthy rags,  and it offers me the beautiful, spotless robe of Christ's perfect  righteousness. Yes, it tells me that God can be just, and the justifier  of him who believes in Jesus.\"    Rose spoke these words with deep emotion, then suddenly clasping her  hands and raising her eyes, she exclaimed, \"'Thanks be unto God for His  unspeakable gift!'\"    For a moment there was silence. Then Adelaide spoke:    \"Rose,\" said she, \"you talk as if you were a great sinner; but I don't  believe it; it is only your humility that makes you think so. Why, what  have you ever done? Had you been a thief, a murderer, or guilty of any  other great crime, I could see the propriety of your using such  language with regard to yourself; but for a refined, intelligent,  amiable young lady, excuse me for saying it, dear Rose, but such  language seems to me simply absurd.\"    \"Man looketh upon the outward appearance, but the Lord pondereth the  heart,\" said Rose, gently. \"No, dear Adelaide, you are mistaken; for I  can truly say 'mine iniquities have gone over my head as a cloud, and  my transgressions as a thick cloud.' Every duty has been stained with  sin, every motive impure, every thought unholy. From my earliest  existence, God has required the undivided love of my whole heart, soul,  strength, and mind; and so far from yielding it, I live at enmity with  Him, and rebellion against His government, until within the last two  years. For seventeen years He has showered blessings upon me, giving me  life, health, strength, friends, and all that was necessary for  happiness; and for fifteen of those years I returned Him nothing but  ingratitude and rebellion. For fifteen years I rejected His offers of  pardon and reconciliation, turned my back upon the Saviour of sinners,  and resisted all the strivings of God's Holy Spirit, and will you say  that I am not a great sinner?\" Her voice quivered, and her eyes were  full of tears.    \"Dear Rose,\" said Adelaide, putting her arm around her friend and  kissing her cheek affectionately, \"don't think of these things;  religion is too gloomy for one so young as you.\"    \"Gloomy, dear Adelaide!\" replied Rose, returning the embrace; \"I never  knew what true happiness was until I found Jesus. My sins often make me  sad, but religion, never.       \"'Oft I walk beneath the cloud,      Dark as midnight's gloomy shroud;      But when fear is at the height,      Jesus comes, and all is light.'\"          CHAPTER SECOND         \"Thy injuries would teach patience to blaspheme,      Yet still thou art a dove.\"                               --BEAUMONT'S _Double Marriage._         \"When forced to part from those we love,        Though sure to meet to-morrow;      We yet a kind of anguish prove        And feel a touch of sorrow.      But oh! what words can paint the fears        When from these friends we sever,      Perhaps to part for months--for years--        Perhaps to part forever.\"                                   --ANON.      When Miss Allison had gone, and Elsie found herself once more quite  alone, she rose from her chair, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6462"],[0,"An Introduction to the mortuary customs of the North American Indians (#3)"],[1,"accompanied  with special ceremonies, the expense and formality attendant upon the  funeral according with the rank of the deceased. The corpse was first  placed in a cane bundle and deposited in an outhouse made for the  purpose, where it was suffered to remain for a day and a night guarded  and mourned over by the nearest relatives with disheveled hair. Those  who are to officiate at the funeral go into the town, and from the  backs of the first young men they meet strip such blankets and  matchcoats as they deem suitable for their purpose. In these the dead  body is wrapped and then covered with two or three mats made of rushes  or cane. The coffin is made of woven reeds or hollow canes tied fast  at both ends. When everything is prepared for the interment, the  corpse is carried from the house in which it has been lying into the  orchard of peach-trees and is there deposited in another bundle.  Seated upon mats are there congregated the family and tribe of the  deceased and invited guests. The medicine man, or conjurer, having  enjoined silence, then pronounces a funeral oration, during which he  recounts the exploits of the deceased, his valor, skill, love of  country, property, and influence, alludes to the void caused by his  death, and counsels those who remain to supply his place by following  in his footsteps; pictures the happiness he will enjoy in the land of  spirits to which he has gone, and concludes his address by an allusion  to the prominent traditions of his tribe.\"    Let us here pause to remind the reader that this custom has prevailed  throughout the civilized world up to the present day--a custom, in the  opinion of many, \"more honored in the breach than the observance.\"    \"At last [says Mr. Lawson], the corpse is brought away from that  hurdle to the grave by four young men, attended by the relations, the  king, old men, and all the nation. When they come to the sepulchre,  which is about six feet deep and eight feet long, having at each end  (that is, at the head and foot) a light-wood or pitch-pine fork driven  close down the sides of the grave firmly into the ground (these two  forks are to contain a ridgepole, as you shall understand presently),  before they lay the corpse into the grave, they cover the bottom two  or three time over with the bark of trees; then they let down the  corpse (with two belts that the Indians carry their burdens withal)  very leisurely upon the said barks; then they lay over a pole of the  same wood in the two forks, and having a great many pieces of pitch-  pine logs about two foot and a half long, they stick them in the sides  of the grave down each end and near the top, through of where (sic) the  other ends lie in the ridge-pole, so that they are declining like the  roof of a house. These being very thick placed, they cover them many  times double with bark; then they throw the earth thereon that came  out of the grave and beat it down very firm. By this means the dead  body lies in a vault, nothing touching him. After a time the body is  taken up, the bones cleaned, and deposited in an ossuary called the  Quiogozon.\"    Dr Fordyce Grinnell, physician to the Wichita Agency, Indian  Territory, furnishes the following description of the burial  ceremonies of the Wichita Indians, who call themselves. \"_Kitty-la-  tats_\" or those of the tattooed eyelids.    \"When a Wichita dies the town-crier goes up and down through the  village and announces the fact. Preparations are immediately made for  the burial, and the body is taken without delay to the grave prepared  for it reception. If the grave is some distance from the village the  body is carried thither on the back of a pony, being first wrapped in  blankets and then laid prone across the saddle, one walking on either  side to support it. The grave is dug from 3 to 4 feet deep and of  sufficient length for the extended body. First blankets and buffalo  robes are laid in the bottom of the grave, then the body, being taken  from the horse and unwrapped, is dressed in its best apparel and with  ornaments is placed upon a couch of blankets and robes, with the head  towards the west and the feet to the east; the valuables belonging to  the deceased are placed with the body in the grave. With the man are  deposited his bows and arrows or gun, and with the woman her cooking  utensils and other implements of her toil. Over the body sticks are  placed six or eight inches deep and grass over these, so that when the  earth is filled in it need not come in contact with the body or its  trappings. After the grave is filled with earth a pen of poles is  built around it, or, as is frequently the case, stakes are driven so  that they cross each other from either side about midway over the  grave, thus forming a complete protection from the invasion of wild  animals. After all this is done, the grass or other _debris_ is  carefully scraped from about the grave for several feet, so that the  ground is left smooth and clean. It is seldom the case that the  relatives accompany the remains to the grave, but they more often  employ others to bury the body for them, usually women. Mourning is  similar in this tribe as in others, and consists in cutting off the  hair, fasting, &c. Horses are also killed at the grave.\"    The Caddoes, _Ascena_, or Timber Indians, as they call  themselves, follow nearly the same mode of burial as the Wichitas, but  one custom prevailing is worthy of mention.    \"If a Caddo is killed in battle, the body is never buried, but is left  to be devoured by beasts or birds of prey and the condition of such  individuals in the other world is considered to be far better than  that of persons dying a natural death.\"    In a work by Bruhier [Footnote: L'incertitude des Signes de la Mort,  1740, tom 1, p. 430] the following remarks, freely translated by the  writer, may be found, which note a custom having great similarity to  the exposure of bodies to wild beasts mentioned above.    \"The ancient Persians threw out the bodies of their dead on the roads,  and if they were promptly devoured by wild beasts it was esteemed a  great honor, a misfortune if not. Sometimes they interred, always  wrapping the dead in a wax cloth to prevent odor.\"    M. Pierre Muret, [Footnote: Rites of Funeral, Ancient and Modern,  1683, p 45] from whose book Bruhier probably obtained his information,  gives at considerable length an account of this peculiar method of  treating the dead among the Persians, as follows:    \"It is a matter of astonishment, considering the _Persians_ have  ever had the renown of being one of the most civilized Nations in the  world, that notwithstanding they should have used such barbarous  customs about the Dead as are set down in the Writings of some  Historians, and the rather because at this day there are still to be  seen among them those remains of Antiquity, which do fully satisfie  us, that their Tombs have been very magnificent. And yet nevertheless,  if we will give credit to _Procopius_ and _Agathias_, the  _Persians_ were never wont to bury their Dead Bodies, so far were  they from bestowing any Funeral Honours upon them. But, as these  Authors tell us, they exposed them stark naked in the open fields,  which is the greatest shame our Laws do allot to the most infamous  Criminals, by laying them open to the view of all upon the highways:  Yea, in their opinion it was a great unhappiness, if either Birds or  Beasts did not devour their Carcases; and they commonly made an  estimate of the Felicity of these poor Bodies, according as they were  sooner or later made a prey of. Concerning these, they resolved that  they must needs have been very bad indeed, since even the beasts  themselves would not touch them; which caused an extream sorrow to  their Relations, they taking it for an ill boding to their Family, and  an infallible presage of some great misfortune hanging over their  heads, for they persuaded themselves, that the Souls which inhabited  those Bodies being dragg'd into Hell, would not fail to come and  trouble them, and that being always accompanied with the Devils, their  Tormentors, they would certainly give them a great deal of disturbance.    \"And on the contrary, when these Corpses were presently devoured,  their joy was very great, they enlarged themselves in praises of the  Deceased; every one esteeming them undoubtedly happy, and came to  congratulate their relations on that account: For as they believed  assuredly, that they were entered into the _Elysian_ Fields, so  they were persuaded, that they would procure the same bliss for all  those of their family.    \"They also took a great delight to see Skeletons and Bones scatered up  and down in the fields, whereas we can scarcely endure to see those of  Horses and Dogs used so. And these remains of Humane Bodies, (the  sight whereof gives us so much, horror, that we presently bury them  out of our sight, whenever we find them elsewhere than in Charnel-  houses or Church yards) were the occasion of their greatest joy  because they concluded from thence the happiness of those that had  been devoured wishing after then Death to meet with the like good  luck.\"    The same author states and Bruhier corroborates the assertion that the  Parthians, Medes, Iberians, Caspians, and a few others had such a  horror and aversion of the corruption and decomposition of the dead  and of their being eaten by worms that they threw out the bodies into  the open fields to be devoured by wild beasts, a part of their belief  being that persons so devoured would not be entirely extinct, but  enjoy at least a partial sort of life in their living sepulchres. It  is quite probable that for these and other reasons the Bactrians and  Hircanians trained dogs for this special purpose called _Canes  sepulchrales_ which received the greatest care and attention, for  it was deemed proper that the souls of the deceased should have strong  and lusty frames"]]]
