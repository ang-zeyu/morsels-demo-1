On the wrong side, too. Sir Charles was debited with 5000 pounds  more than the total amount that was shown on the counterfoils.    I examined the book with care. The source of the error was obvious.  It lay in a cheque to Self or Bearer, for 5000 pounds, signed by Sir  Charles, and evidently paid across the counter in London, as it bore  on its face no stamp or indication of any other office.    I called in my brother-in-law from the salon to the study. \"Look  here, Charles,\" I said, \"there's a cheque in the book which you  haven't entered.\" And I handed it to him without comment, for I  thought it might have been drawn to settle some little loss on the  turf or at cards, or to make up some other affair he didn't desire  to mention to me. These things will happen.    He looked at it and stared hard. Then he pursed up his mouth and  gave a long low \"Whew!\" At last he turned it over and remarked,  \"I say, Sey, my boy, we've just been done jolly well brown,  haven't we?\"    I glanced at the cheque. \"How do you mean?\" I inquired.    \"Why, the Seer,\" he replied, still staring at it ruefully. \"I  don't mind the five thou., but to think the fellow should have  gammoned the pair of us like that--ignominious, I call it!\"    \"How do you know it's the Seer?\" I asked.    \"Look at the green ink,\" he answered. \"Besides, I recollect the  very shape of the last flourish. I flourished a bit like that in  the excitement of the moment, which I don't always do with my  regular signature.\"    \"He's done us,\" I answered, recognising it. \"But how the dickens  did he manage to transfer it to the cheque? This looks like your  own handwriting, Charles, not a clever forgery.\"    \"It is,\" he said. \"I admit it--I can't deny it. Only fancy his  bamboozling me when I was most on my guard! I wasn't to be taken  in by any of his silly occult tricks and catch-words; but it never  occurred to me he was going to victimise me financially in this  way. I expected attempts at a loan or an extortion; but to collar  my signature to a blank cheque--atrocious!\"    \"How did he manage it?\" I asked.    \"I haven't the faintest conception. I only know those are the  words I wrote. I could swear to them anywhere.\"    \"Then you can't protest the cheque?\"    \"Unfortunately, no; it's my own true signature.\"    We went that afternoon without delay to see the Chief Commissary  of Police at the office. He was a gentlemanly Frenchman, much less  formal and red-tapey than usual, and he spoke excellent English  with an American accent, having acted, in fact, as a detective in  New York for about ten years in his early manhood.    \"I guess,\" he said slowly, after hearing our story, \"you've been  victimised right here by Colonel Clay, gentlemen.\"    \"Who is Colonel Clay?\" Sir Charles asked.    \"That's just what I want to know,\" the Commissary answered, in  his curious American-French-English. \"He is a Colonel, because he  occasionally gives himself a commission; he is called Colonel Clay,  because he appears to possess an india-rubber face, and he can  mould it like clay in the hands of the potter. Real name, unknown.  Nationality, equally French and English. Address, usually Europe.  Profession, former maker of wax figures to the Musee Grevin. Age,  what he chooses. Employs his knowledge to mould his own nose  and cheeks, with wax additions, to the character he desires to  personate. Aquiline this time, you say. Hein! Anything like these  photographs?\"    He rummaged in his desk and handed us two.    \"Not in the least,\" Sir Charles answered. \"Except, perhaps, as to the  neck, everything here is quite unlike him.\"    \"Then that's the Colonel!\" the Commissary answered, with decision,  rubbing his hands in glee. \"Look here,\" and he took out a pencil  and rapidly sketched the outline of one of the two faces--that of  a bland-looking young man, with no expression worth mentioning.  \"There's the Colonel in his simple disguise. Very good. Now watch  me: figure to yourself that he adds here a tiny patch of wax to his  nose--an aquiline bridge--just so; well, you have him right there;  and the chin, ah, one touch: now, for hair, a wig: for complexion,  nothing easier: that's the profile of your rascal, isn't it?\"    \"Exactly,\" we both murmured. By two curves of the pencil, and a  shock of false hair, the face was transmuted.    \"He had very large eyes, with very big pupils, though,\" I objected,  looking close; \"and the man in the photograph here has them small  and boiled-fishy.\"    \"That's so,\" the Commissary answered. \"A drop of belladonna  expands--and produces the Seer; five grains of opium contract--and  give a dead-alive, stupidly-innocent appearance. Well, you leave  this affair to me, gentlemen. I'll see the fun out. I don't say I'll  catch him for you; nobody ever yet has caught Colonel Clay; but  I'll explain how he did the trick; and that ought to be consolation  enough to a man of your means for a trifle of five thousand!\"    \"You are not the conventional French office-holder, M. le  Commissaire,\" I ventured to interpose.    \"You bet!\" the Commissary replied, and drew himself up like a  captain of infantry. \"Messieurs,\" he continued, in French, with the  utmost dignity, \"I shall devote the resources of this office to  tracing out the crime, and, if possible, to effectuating the arrest  of the culpable.\"    We telegraphed to London, of course, and we wrote to the bank, with  a full description of the suspected person. But I need hardly add  that nothing came of it.    Three days later the Commissary called at our hotel. \"Well,  gentlemen,\" he said, \"I am glad to say I have discovered  everything!\"    \"What? Arrested the Seer?\" Sir Charles cried.    The Commissary drew back, almost horrified at the suggestion.    \"Arrested Colonel Clay?\" he exclaimed. \"Mais, monsieur, we are only  human! Arrested him? No, not quite. But tracked out how he did it.  That is already much--to unravel Colonel Clay, gentlemen!\"    \"Well, what do you make of it?\" Sir Charles asked, crestfallen.    The Commissary sat down and gloated over his discovery. It was  clear a well-planned crime amused him vastly. \"In the first place,  monsieur,\" he said, \"disabuse your mind of the idea that when  monsieur your secretary went out to fetch Senor Herrera that night,  Senor Herrera didn't know to whose rooms he was coming. Quite  otherwise, in point of fact. I do not doubt myself that Senor  Herrera, or Colonel Clay (call him which you like), came to Nice  this winter for no other purpose than just to rob you.\"    \"But I sent for him,\" my brother-in-law interposed.    \"Yes; he _meant_ you to send for him. He forced a card, so to  speak. If he couldn't do that I guess he would be a pretty poor  conjurer. He had a lady of his own--his wife, let us say, or his  sister--stopping here at this hotel; a certain Madame Picardet.  Through her he induced several ladies of your circle to attend his  seances. She and they spoke to you about him, and aroused your  curiosity. You may bet your bottom dollar that when he came to  this room he came ready primed and prepared with endless facts  about both of you.\"    \"What fools we have been, Sey,\" my brother-in-law exclaimed. \"I see  it all now. That designing woman sent round before dinner to say I  wanted to meet him; and by the time you got there he was ready  for bamboozling me.\"    \"That's so,\" the Commissary answered. \"He had your name ready  painted on both his arms; and he had made other preparations of  still greater importance.\"    \"You mean the cheque. Well, how did he get it?\"    The Commissary opened the door. \"Come in,\" he said. And a young man  entered whom we recognised at once as the chief clerk in the Foreign  Department of the Credit Marseillais, the principal bank all along  the Riviera.    \"State what you know of this cheque,\" the Commissary said, showing  it to him, for we had handed it over to the police as a piece of  evidence.    \"About four weeks since--\" the clerk began.    \"Say ten days before your seance,\" the Commissary interposed.    \"A gentleman with very long hair and an aquiline nose, dark,  strange, and handsome, called in at my department and asked if I  could tell him the name of Sir Charles Vandrift's London banker.  He said he had a sum to pay in to your credit, and asked if we  would forward it for him. I told him it was irregular for us to  receive the money, as you had no account with us, but that your  London bankers were Darby, Drummond, and Rothenberg, Limited.\"    \"Quite right,\" Sir Charles murmured.    \"Two days later a lady, Madame Picardet, who was a customer of ours,  brought in a good cheque for three hundred pounds, signed by a  first-rate name, and asked us to pay it in on her behalf to Darby,  Drummond, and Rothenberg's, and to open a London account with them  for her. We did so, and received in reply a cheque-book.\"    \"From which this cheque was taken, as I learn from the number,  by telegram from London,\" the Commissary put in. \"Also, that on  the same day on which your cheque was cashed, Madame Picardet,  in London, withdrew her balance.\"    \"But how did the fellow get me to sign the cheque?\" Sir Charles  cried. \"How did he manage the card trick?\"    The Commissary produced a similar card from his pocket. \"Was that  the sort of thing?\" he asked.    \"Precisely! A facsimile.\"    \"I thought so. Well, our Colonel, I find, bought a packet of such  cards, intended for admission to a religious function, at a shop  in the Quai Massena. He cut out the centre, and, see here--\" The  Commissary turned it over, and showed a piece of paper pasted neatly  over the back; this he tore off, and there, concealed behind it, lay  a folded cheque, with only the place where the signature should be  written showing through on the face which the Seer had presented  to us. \"I call that a neat trick,\" the Commissary remarked, with  professional enjoyment of a"]]]
