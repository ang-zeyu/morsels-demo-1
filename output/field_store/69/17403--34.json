[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#3)"],[1,"time, the late Orson Pratt made the following valuable  comment:        This book, the Book of Mormon, informs us that the time of day      at which Jesus was crucified, I mean the time of day here in      America, was in the morning; the New Testament tells us that      Jesus was crucified in Asia in the afternoon, between the sixth      and ninth hour according to the Jews' reckoning. They commenced      their reckoning at six o'clock in the morning, and consequently      the sixth hour would be twelve o'clock at noon, and the ninth hour      three o'clock in the afternoon. Jesus, from the sixth to the ninth      hour, in other words from twelve o'clock to three, was hanging      on the cross. Now the Book of Mormon, or the historians whose      records it contains, when relating the incidents that transpired      at the time of the crucifixion--the darkness that was spread over      the face of the land, the earthquakes, the rending of rocks, the      sinking of cities and the whirlwinds--say these events occurred      in the morning; they also say that darkness was spread over the      face of the land for the space of three days. In Jerusalem it was      only three hours. But the Lord gave them a special sign in this      country and the darkness lasted three days, and at the expiration      of three days, and three nights of darkness, it cleared off, and it      was in the morning. That shows that, according to the time of this      country, [America] the crucifixion must have taken place in the      morning.    Says one, \"Is not this a contradiction between the Book of Mormon  and the New Testament?\" To an unlearned person it would really be a  contradiction, for the four Evangelists place it [the time during which  Jesus was on the cross] from twelve to three in the afternoon, while  the Book of Mormon says in the morning. An unlearned person, seeing  this discrepancy, would say, of course, that both books cannot be true.    If the Book of Mormon be true the Bible cannot be; and if the Bible be  true the Book of Mormon cannot be.    I do not known that anybody ever brought up this objection, for I do  not think they ever thought of it. I do not think that the Prophet  Joseph, who translated the book, ever thought of this apparent  discrepancy. \"But,\" says one, \"how do you account for it being in  the morning in America and in the afternoon in Jerusalem?\" Simply by  the difference in longitude. This would make a difference of time of  several hours; for when it would be twelve at noon in Jerusalem it  would only be half-past four in the morning in the north-west part  of South America, where the Book of Mormon was then being written.  Seven and a half hours difference in longitude would account for  this apparent discrepancy; and if the Book of Mormon had said the  crucifixion took place in the afternoon we should have known at once  that it could not be true. This is incidental proof to learned or  scientific men that they cannot very well reason away, and especially  when the instrument [i. e. Joseph Smith] who brought forth the Book of  Mormon is considered. It must be remembered that he was but a youth,  and unlearned; and, when he translated this work, I presume that he was  unaware that there was any difference in the time of day, according to  the longitude, in different parts of the earth. I do not suppose that  Joseph ever thought about it to the day of his death. I never heard him  or any other person bring forth this as confirmatory evidence of the  divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon. I never thought of it myself  until years after Joseph's death; but when I did reflect upon it, I  could see the reason why the Lord, through his servants, has said in  the Book of Mormon, that the crucifixion took place in the morning. [13]    In addition to the passages already quoted, giving the native  traditions which, doubtless contain references to the cataclysms at the  death of Messiah, as well as to the signs of his birth, Bancroft gives  a Toltec tradition directly bearing on the subject, as follows:        The sun and moon were eclipsed, the earth shook, and the rocks were      rent asunder, and many other things and signs happened, though      there was no loss of life. This was in the year Ce Calli, which,      the chronology being reduced to our system, proves to be the same      date when Christ our Lord suffered, 33 A. D. [14]    The statement in the foregoing that there was no loss of life resulting  from this cataclysm is the only item that mars its perfect agreement  with the Book of Mormon incident.        Bouturini, commending the exact chronology of the ancient Mexicans      says: \"No pagan nation refers primitive events to fixed creation of      the world, of the deluge, of the confusion of tongues at the time      of the Tower of Babel, of the other epochs and ages of the world,      of their ancestors' long travel in Asia, with the years precisely      distinguished by their corresponding characters. They record in      the year of Seven Rabbits the great eclipse which happened at the      crucifixion of Christ our Lord. [15]    The date assigned for this eclipse of sun and moon (darkness), and the  attendant earthquakes in the foregoing quotations, is corroborated in  a very remarkable manner by the native Peruvian historian Montesinos,  quoted by Rivero and Tschudi. In giving a list of the Peruvian  monarchs, when reaching the sixtieth, Manco-Capac III., our authors say:        According to the Amautas [Peruvian \"wise men,\" or philosophers]      this prince reigned in the year two thousand nine hundred and fifty      after the deluge, and consequently at the birth of Jesus Christ, an      epoch when Peru had reached her highest elevation and extension.      [16]    Following this sixtieth monarch came Cayo-Manco-Capec III., who reigned  twenty years. He was followed by Sinchi-Ayar-Manco, who reigned seven  years. He, by Huamantaco-Amauta, who reigned five years; which brings  us to the year thirty-two A. D., and then follows this statement by  our authors, which corroborates the date cited by Bancroft for the  cataclysm under consideration, viz:        During his reign [thirty-two or thirty-three A. D.], [17] they      experienced earthquakes that lasted several months. [18]    Brasseur de Bourbourg, [19] to whom Bancroft gives high praise as an  authority on the languages and traditions of Central America, speaks  of physical cataclysms which, according to the native traditions, took  place in that part of America, and which are undoubtedly the imperfect  accounts of those cataclysms which occurred at the death of Messiah,  as recorded in the Book of Mormon. Brasseur became infatuated with the  Atlantis theory, and regarded the native American traditions concerning  the physical convulsions in nature as describing the submergence of  the ancient Atlantis. With the theory of the learned Frenchman I have  nothing to do. He may have made a wrong application of the facts of  the native traditions. I think he did. But what I am interested in  is the fact that so highly commended an authority draws from native  sources the tradition of physical cataclysms which so nearly accord  with the statements of fact in the Book of Mormon. [20] After relating  Brasseur's connection with the Atlantis theory, Baldwin says:        In the first place, Brasseur de Bourbourg claims that there is in      the old Central American books a constant tradition of an immense      catastrophe of the character supposed [i. e., the convulsions which      submerged Atlantis]; that this tradition existed every where among      the people when they first became known to Europeans; and that      recollections of the catastrophe were preserved in some of their      festivals, especially in one celebrated in the month of Izcalli,      which was instituted to commemorate this frightful destruction      of land and people, and in which \"princes and people humbled      themselves before the divinity, and besought him to withhold a      return of such terrible calamities.\" This tradition affirms that      a part of the continent extending into the Atlantic was destroyed      in the manner supposed, [submerged] and appear to indicate that      the destruction was accomplished by a succession of frightful      convulsions. Three are constantly mentioned, and sometimes there      is mention of one or two others. \"The land was shaken by frightful      earthquakes, and the waves of the sea combined with volcanic fires      to overwhelm and ingulf it.\" Each convulsion swept away portions      of the land, until the whole disappeared, leaving the line of the      coast as it is now. Most of the inhabitants, overtaken amid their      regular employments, were destroyed; but some escaped in ships,      and some fled for safety to the summits of high mountains, or      to portions of the land which, for the time, escaped immediate      destruction. Quotations are made from the old books in which this      tradition is recorded which appear to verify his report of what is      found in them. To criticise intelligently his interpretation of      their significance, one needs to have a knowledge of those books      and tradition equal at least to his own. [21]    Nadaillac also refers to the native traditions collected by Brasseur on  this subject and quotes him as follows:        If I may judge from allusions in the documents that I have been      fortunate enough to collect, there were in these regions, at that      remote date, convulsions of nature, deluges, terrible inundations,      followed by the upheaval of mountains, accompanied by volcanic      eruptions. These traditions, traces of which are also met with in      Mexico, Central America, Peru, and Bolivia, point to the conclusion      that man existed in these various countries at the time of the      upheaval of the Cordilleras, and that the memory of that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59970"],[0,"The Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet (#3)"],[1,"reservoir for all the streams  of wickedness and infamy.\" [1]    In the midst of these early tribulations, the plain and simple Gospel  was becoming involved and mystified by the many opposing sects which  professed to believe in Jesus; and yet it retained so much of divinity  as enabled it to resist persecution and idolatry, and made it, in the  fourth century, the established religion of Rome.    This elevation was not achieved without some sacrifice of identity. And  in the commingling with error, truth yielded much. [3]    The Roman emperor, Constantine I., was led to show favor to the  unpopular people; but his friendliness to Christianity demanded and  received its price. He sought as much the welfare of the state as the  progress of the religion to which he had been only in part converted;  and when he exacted concessions of creed and principle, the Fathers  felt forced to comply. It was Constantine who called the first Council  of Nice. He presided over its opening session, and dictated its policy  in accordance with his own imperial ambitions. [4]    From that time on, for twelve hundred years, the Church of Rome grew in  lustful power. The first great check was when the German monk, Martin  Luther, with bared feet, fled in disappointment from the debauched  court of Pope Leo X. Luther's courage partly stripped the idol of its  awe-invoking cloak of mystery and dread threats; and never more did the  whole civilized world crouch in terror at the feet of Rome.    The freedom of thought heralded by the Reformation, at last found its  abuse in the Age of Reason and the blasphemy of the French Revolution.  At first rejecting Christianity for a dream of paganism restored, the  infidels, in turn, exchanged pagan mythology, with its gods many, for  their own new mythology, with its gods none.    This tempest of profane unbelief was too violent to be enduring. A  re-awakening to religious fervor was manifest in Christendom. Men  gladly blotted from their memories the dread of the _auto-da-fe_; the  inquisition dungeons and racks of Spain and Italy, the funeral fires  of England, the witch-hanging and Quaker-driving of the New World, and  all the atrocities sacrilegiously practiced as ceremonies of worship.  Mankind turned back by thousands to find satisfaction for their  inherent necessity--belief in a Higher Power.    But that Higher Power was itself an unfathomable mystery. God had been  misunderstood for centuries. Much of the world had known nothing of Him  --His nature or His purposes--from the death of Christ's Apostles. The  men who had known Him walked no more in the midst of mankind. Prophets  and apostles, while they lived, taught their fellow-men that he was  a distinct personality--a glorious Being in whose likeness man was  created. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was declared \"to be made like  unto his brethren\"--\"made in the likeness of men\"--and \"in the likeness  of sinful flesh;\" yet inspired men claimed Him as being \"in the form of  God\"--\"the express image of His person\"--\"the image of the invisible  God.\" But, as generations and centuries passed, true knowledge  concerning the Creator faded away. A spiritual meaning concerning His  personage and attributes was given to the testimony of those who had  known Him. Modern sectarianism taught the world that God, the Father,  of whose person Jesus was the \"express image,\" was an all-pervading God  of spirit--a Being who, without any tangible existence, is everywhere  in the material world--a Being \"without body, parts or passions,\"  \"whose center was nowhere and whose circumference was everywhere.\"  Professing to have an understanding of the Deity, they differed but  little from the Pantheists, who, rejecting a personal God, made bold  avowal of an all-existing God of nature--the combined forces and laws  which are manifested in the existing universe.    Thus blinded, how could mankind offer true worship to the Lord of  heaven and earth?    The Eastern World had lost this knowledge of the Lord earlier than the  Western Hemisphere. Upon the land of North America, four hundred years  after the birth of our Savior and Master, there stood at least one  man who knew the Lord God Almighty as a distinct personality, a Being  capable of communicating Himself to man. That man was Moroni, the son  of Mormon, whose testimony abides now and must abide through all the  ages to come. [5]    It was upon this land that Jesus last appeared to His brethren who  dwelt in mortality; and it was predestined that upon this land man was  to first receive a renewal of divine revelation. After the discovery  of the hemisphere which had been so long concealed from the knowledge  of those who had dwelt upon the other parts of the earth, nearly three  centuries elapsed before a nation with a charter of liberty divinely  ordained was established. In God's providence it was necessary that  those who had been led here by His hand should receive political  emancipation to prepare the way for the restoration of the gospel in  its purity and the Church of Christ in the plenitude of its power.  Political salvation had first been declared, that men's bodies might be  free and their souls be filled with high aspirations to prepare for the  greater enfranchisement and redemption which were to appear.    The period succeeding the Revolution was filled with a veritable Babel  of religious creeds. Every obsolete tradition was revived; every  possible human fancy of doctrine was promulgated; and each found its  upholding sect. Confusion and doubt waxed fat, feeding upon human  fears. No earthly wisdom could bring peace to the sects or make harmony  among the creeds.    It became the ripe hour for the Heavens to open and with their  Celestial light show to man the way out of the abyss into which he had  fallen. It became the hour for the re-establishment of heavenly truth  --the Gospel of Christ and its direct communications between God and  humanity: a religion which should cast off alike the skepticism of  \"reason\" and the shackles of superstition; a religion which should be  bold in righteous faith and convincing in its revealed philosophy. By  Divine aid the way had been paved for this renewal.    For the greater part of eighteen hundred years humanity had been  perverting the Gospel of Jesus, the Anointed.    Then the Eternal Father, and His Son Jesus Christ, revealed themselves  from heaven. This glorious manifestation was followed by the angel  flying in the midst of heaven, who proclaimed that the restoration of  the Gospel had come.    Footnotes    1. Tacitus    2. Suetonius    3. Paganism, unable to oppose Christianity successfully, has done much  to corrupt it, and in numberless ways had made inroads upon its purity.  _Prof. T. M. Lindsay_, Glasgow.    4. The interest of the emperor [Constantine] was still (at the Council  of Nice) primarily political and official, rather than personal. _W.  Browning Smith_.    5. Behold, will ye believe in the day of your visitation, behold, when  the Lord shall come; yea, even that great day when the earth shall be  rolled together as a scroll, and the elements shall melt with fervent  heat; yea, in that great day when ye shall be brought to stand before  the Lamb of God, then will ye say there is no God?    Then will ye longer deny the Christ, or can ye behold the Lamb of God?    For behold, when ye shall be brought to see your nakedness before God  and also, the glory of God, and the holiness of Jesus Christ, it will  kindle a flame of unquenchable fire upon you.    O then ye unbelieving, turn ye unto the Lord; cry mightily unto the  Father in the name of Jesus, that perhaps ye may be found spotless,  pure, fair, and white, having been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb,  at that great and last day.    And again I speak unto you who deny the revelations of God, and  say that they are done away, that there are no revelations, nor  prophecies, nor gifts, nor healing, nor speaking with tongues, and the  interpretation of tongues.    Behold I say unto you, he that denieth these things, knoweth not the  gospel of Christ.    For do we not read that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever;  and in Him there is no variableness neither shadow of changing?        THE MAN    Joseph Smith at Nauvoo.    May 15, 1844.    _It is by no means improbable that some future text-book, for the use  of generations yet unborn, will contain a question something like this:  What historical American of the nineteenth century has exerted the most  powerful influence upon the destinies of his countrymen? And it is by  no means impossible that the answer to that interrogatory may be thus  written: JOSEPH SMITH, THE MORMON PROPHET. And the reply, absurd as it  doubtless seems to most men now living, may be an obvious commonplace  to their descendants. History deals in surprises and paradoxes quite as  startling as this. The man who established a religion in this age of  free debate, who was and is today accepted by hundreds of thousands as  a direct emissary from the Most High--such a rare human being is not  to be disposed of by pelting his memory with unsavory epithets. * * *  The most vital questions Americans are asking each other today have to  do with this man and what he has left us. * * * Burning questions they  are, which must give a prominent place in the history of the country  to that sturdy self-asserter whom I visited at Nauvoo. Joseph Smith,  claiming to be an inspired teacher, faced adversity such as few men  have been called to meet, enjoyed a brief season of prosperity such  as few men have ever attained, and, finally, forty-three days after I  saw him, went cheerfully to a martyr's death. When he surrendered his  person to Governor Ford, in order to prevent the shedding of blood, the  Prophet had a presentiment of what was before him. \"I am going like a  lamb to the slaughter,\" he is reported to have said; \"but I am as calm  as a summer's"]]]
