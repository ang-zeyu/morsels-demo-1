All traces of the personality of Cervantes had by that time  disappeared. Any floating traditions that may once have existed,  transmitted from men who had known him, had long since died out, and of  other record there was none; for the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries  were incurious as to \"the men of the time,\" a reproach against which the  nineteenth has, at any rate, secured itself, if it has produced no  Shakespeare or Cervantes. All that Mayans y Siscar, to whom the task was  entrusted, or any of those who followed him, Rios, Pellicer, or  Navarrete, could do was to eke out the few allusions Cervantes makes to  himself in his various prefaces with such pieces of documentary evidence  bearing upon his life as they could find.    This, however, has been done by the last-named biographer to such good  purpose that he has superseded all predecessors. Thoroughness is the  chief characteristic of Navarrete's work. Besides sifting, testing, and  methodising with rare patience and judgment what had been previously  brought to light, he left, as the saying is, no stone unturned under  which anything to illustrate his subject might possibly be found.  Navarrete has done all that industry and acumen could do, and it is no  fault of his if he has not given us what we want. What Hallam says of  Shakespeare may be applied to the almost parallel case of Cervantes: \"It  is not the register of his baptism, or the draft of his will, or the  orthography of his name that we seek; no letter of his writing, no record  of his conversation, no character of him drawn ... by a contemporary has  been produced.\"    It is only natural, therefore, that the biographers of Cervantes, forced  to make brick without straw, should have recourse largely to conjecture,  and that conjecture should in some instances come by degrees to take the  place of established fact. All that I propose to do here is to separate  what is matter of fact from what is matter of conjecture, and leave it to  the reader's judgment to decide whether the data justify the inference or  not.    The men whose names by common consent stand in the front rank of Spanish  literature, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Quevedo, Calderon, Garcilaso de la  Vega, the Mendozas, Gongora, were all men of ancient families, and,  curiously, all, except the last, of families that traced their origin to  the same mountain district in the North of Spain. The family of Cervantes  is commonly said to have been of Galician origin, and unquestionably it  was in possession of lands in Galicia at a very early date; but I think  the balance of the evidence tends to show that the \"solar,\" the original  site of the family, was at Cervatos in the north-west corner of Old  Castile, close to the junction of Castile, Leon, and the Asturias. As it  happens, there is a complete history of the Cervantes family from the  tenth century down to the seventeenth extant under the title of  \"Illustrious Ancestry, Glorious Deeds, and Noble Posterity of the Famous  Nuno Alfonso, Alcaide of Toledo,\" written in 1648 by the industrious  genealogist Rodrigo Mendez Silva, who availed himself of a manuscript  genealogy by Juan de Mena, the poet laureate and historiographer of John  II.    The origin of the name Cervantes is curious. Nuno Alfonso was almost as  distinguished in the struggle against the Moors in the reign of Alfonso  VII as the Cid had been half a century before in that of Alfonso VI, and  was rewarded by divers grants of land in the neighbourhood of Toledo. On  one of his acquisitions, about two leagues from the city, he built  himself a castle which he called Cervatos, because \"he was lord of the  solar of Cervatos in the Montana,\" as the mountain region extending from  the Basque Provinces to Leon was always called. At his death in battle in  1143, the castle passed by his will to his son Alfonso Munio, who, as  territorial or local surnames were then coming into vogue in place of the  simple patronymic, took the additional name of Cervatos. His eldest son  Pedro succeeded him in the possession of the castle, and followed his  example in adopting the name, an assumption at which the younger son,  Gonzalo, seems to have taken umbrage.    Everyone who has paid even a flying visit to Toledo will remember the  ruined castle that crowns the hill above the spot where the bridge of  Alcantara spans the gorge of the Tagus, and with its broken outline and  crumbling walls makes such an admirable pendant to the square solid  Alcazar towering over the city roofs on the opposite side. It was built,  or as some say restored, by Alfonso VI shortly after his occupation of  Toledo in 1085, and called by him San Servando after a Spanish martyr, a  name subsequently modified into San Servan (in which form it appears in  the \"Poem of the Cid\"), San Servantes, and San Cervantes: with regard to  which last the \"Handbook for Spain\" warns its readers against the  supposition that it has anything to do with the author of \"Don Quixote.\"  Ford, as all know who have taken him for a companion and counsellor on  the roads of Spain, is seldom wrong in matters of literature or history.  In this instance, however, he is in error. It has everything to do with  the author of \"Don Quixote,\" for it is in fact these old walls that have  given to Spain the name she is proudest of to-day. Gonzalo, above  mentioned, it may be readily conceived, did not relish the appropriation  by his brother of a name to which he himself had an equal right, for  though nominally taken from the castle, it was in reality derived from  the ancient territorial possession of the family, and as a set-off, and  to distinguish himself (diferenciarse) from his brother, he took as a  surname the name of the castle on the bank of the Tagus, in the building  of which, according to a family tradition, his great-grandfather had a  share.    Both brothers founded families. The Cervantes branch had more tenacity;  it sent offshoots in various directions, Andalusia, Estremadura, Galicia,  and Portugal, and produced a goodly line of men distinguished in the  service of Church and State. Gonzalo himself, and apparently a son of  his, followed Ferdinand III in the great campaign of 1236-48 that gave  Cordova and Seville to Christian Spain and penned up the Moors in the  kingdom of Granada, and his descendants intermarried with some of the  noblest families of the Peninsula and numbered among them soldiers,  magistrates, and Church dignitaries, including at least two  cardinal-archbishops.    Of the line that settled in Andalusia, Deigo de Cervantes, Commander of  the Order of Santiago, married Juana Avellaneda, daughter of Juan Arias  de Saavedra, and had several sons, of whom one was Gonzalo Gomez,  Corregidor of Jerez and ancestor of the Mexican and Columbian branches of  the family; and another, Juan, whose son Rodrigo married Dona Leonor de  Cortinas, and by her had four children, Rodrigo, Andrea, Luisa, and  Miguel, our author.    The pedigree of Cervantes is not without its bearing on \"Don Quixote.\" A  man who could look back upon an ancestry of genuine knights-errant  extending from well-nigh the time of Pelayo to the siege of Granada was  likely to have a strong feeling on the subject of the sham chivalry of  the romances. It gives a point, too, to what he says in more than one  place about families that have once been great and have tapered away  until they have come to nothing, like a pyramid. It was the case of his  own.    He was born at Alcala de Henares and baptised in the church of Santa  Maria Mayor on the 9th of October, 1547. Of his boyhood and youth we know  nothing, unless it be from the glimpse he gives us in the preface to his  \"Comedies\" of himself as a boy looking on with delight while Lope de  Rueda and his company set up their rude plank stage in the plaza and  acted the rustic farces which he himself afterwards took as the model of  his interludes. This first glimpse, however, is a significant one, for it  shows the early development of that love of the drama which exercised  such an influence on his life and seems to have grown stronger as he grew  older, and of which this very preface, written only a few months before  his death, is such a striking proof. He gives us to understand, too, that  he was a great reader in his youth; but of this no assurance was needed,  for the First Part of \"Don Quixote\" alone proves a vast amount of  miscellaneous reading, romances of chivalry, ballads, popular poetry,  chronicles, for which he had no time or opportunity except in the first  twenty years of his life; and his misquotations and mistakes in matters  of detail are always, it may be noticed, those of a man recalling the  reading of his boyhood.    Other things besides the drama were in their infancy when Cervantes was a  boy. The period of his boyhood was in every way a transition period for  Spain. The old chivalrous Spain had passed away. The new Spain was the  mightiest power the world had seen since the Roman Empire and it had not  yet been called upon to pay the price of its greatness. By the policy of  Ferdinand and Ximenez the sovereign had been made absolute, and the  Church and Inquisition adroitly adjusted to keep him so. The nobles, who  had always resisted absolutism as strenuously as they had fought the  Moors, had been divested of all political power, a like fate had befallen  the cities, the free constitutions of Castile and Aragon had been swept  away, and the only function that remained to the Cortes was that of  granting money at the King's dictation.    The "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5946"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 2, Complete (#3)"],[1," Benengeli, in the Second Part of this history, and third  sally of Don Quixote, says that the curate and the barber remained nearly  a month without seeing him, lest they should recall or bring back to his  recollection what had taken place. They did not, however, omit to visit  his niece and housekeeper, and charge them to be careful to treat him  with attention, and give him comforting things to eat, and such as were  good for the heart and the brain, whence, it was plain to see, all his  misfortune proceeded. The niece and housekeeper replied that they did so,  and meant to do so with all possible care and assiduity, for they could  perceive that their master was now and then beginning to show signs of  being in his right mind. This gave great satisfaction to the curate and  the barber, for they concluded they had taken the right course in  carrying him off enchanted on the ox-cart, as has been described in the  First Part of this great as well as accurate history, in the last chapter  thereof. So they resolved to pay him a visit and test the improvement in  his condition, although they thought it almost impossible that there  could be any; and they agreed not to touch upon any point connected with  knight-errantry so as not to run the risk of reopening wounds which were  still so tender.    They came to see him consequently, and found him sitting up in bed in a  green baize waistcoat and a red Toledo cap, and so withered and dried up  that he looked as if he had been turned into a mummy. They were very  cordially received by him; they asked him after his health, and he talked  to them about himself very naturally and in very well-chosen language. In  the course of their conversation they fell to discussing what they call  State-craft and systems of government, correcting this abuse and  condemning that, reforming one practice and abolishing another, each of  the three setting up for a new legislator, a modern Lycurgus, or a  brand-new Solon; and so completely did they remodel the State, that they  seemed to have thrust it into a furnace and taken out something quite  different from what they had put in; and on all the subjects they dealt  with, Don Quixote spoke with such good sense that the pair of examiners  were fully convinced that he was quite recovered and in his full senses.    The niece and housekeeper were present at the conversation and could not  find words enough to express their thanks to God at seeing their master  so clear in his mind; the curate, however, changing his original plan,  which was to avoid touching upon matters of chivalry, resolved to test  Don Quixote's recovery thoroughly, and see whether it were genuine or  not; and so, from one subject to another, he came at last to talk of the  news that had come from the capital, and, among other things, he said it  was considered certain that the Turk was coming down with a powerful  fleet, and that no one knew what his purpose was, or when the great storm  would burst; and that all Christendom was in apprehension of this, which  almost every year calls us to arms, and that his Majesty had made  provision for the security of the coasts of Naples and Sicily and the  island of Malta.    To this Don Quixote replied, \"His Majesty has acted like a prudent  warrior in providing for the safety of his realms in time, so that the  enemy may not find him unprepared; but if my advice were taken I would  recommend him to adopt a measure which at present, no doubt, his Majesty  is very far from thinking of.\"    The moment the curate heard this he said to himself, \"God keep thee in  his hand, poor Don Quixote, for it seems to me thou art precipitating  thyself from the height of thy madness into the profound abyss of thy  simplicity.\"    But the barber, who had the same suspicion as the curate, asked Don  Quixote what would be his advice as to the measures that he said ought to  be adopted; for perhaps it might prove to be one that would have to be  added to the list of the many impertinent suggestions that people were in  the habit of offering to princes.    \"Mine, master shaver,\" said Don Quixote, \"will not be impertinent, but,  on the contrary, pertinent.\"    \"I don't mean that,\" said the barber, \"but that experience has shown that  all or most of the expedients which are proposed to his Majesty are  either impossible, or absurd, or injurious to the King and to the  kingdom.\"    \"Mine, however,\" replied Don Quixote, \"is neither impossible nor absurd,  but the easiest, the most reasonable, the readiest and most expeditious  that could suggest itself to any projector's mind.\"    \"You take a long time to tell it, Senor Don Quixote,\" said the curate.    \"I don't choose to tell it here, now,\" said Don Quixote, \"and have it  reach the ears of the lords of the council to-morrow morning, and some  other carry off the thanks and rewards of my trouble.\"    \"For my part,\" said the barber, \"I give my word here and before God that  I will not repeat what your worship says, to King, Rook or earthly  man--an oath I learned from the ballad of the curate, who, in the  prelude, told the king of the thief who had robbed him of the hundred  gold crowns and his pacing mule.\"    \"I am not versed in stories,\" said Don Quixote; \"but I know the oath is a  good one, because I know the barber to be an honest fellow.\"    \"Even if he were not,\" said the curate, \"I will go bail and answer for  him that in this matter he will be as silent as a dummy, under pain of  paying any penalty that may be pronounced.\"    \"And who will be security for you, senor curate?\" said Don Quixote.    \"My profession,\" replied the curate, \"which is to keep secrets.\"    \"Ods body!\" said Don Quixote at this, \"what more has his Majesty to do  but to command, by public proclamation, all the knights-errant that are  scattered over Spain to assemble on a fixed day in the capital, for even  if no more than half a dozen come, there may be one among them who alone  will suffice to destroy the entire might of the Turk. Give me your  attention and follow me. Is it, pray, any new thing for a single  knight-errant to demolish an army of two hundred thousand men, as if they  all had but one throat or were made of sugar paste? Nay, tell me, how  many histories are there filled with these marvels? If only (in an evil  hour for me: I don't speak for anyone else) the famous Don Belianis were  alive now, or any one of the innumerable progeny of Amadis of Gaul! If  any these were alive to-day, and were to come face to face with the Turk,  by my faith, I would not give much for the Turk's chance. But God will  have regard for his people, and will provide some one, who, if not so  valiant as the knights-errant of yore, at least will not be inferior to  them in spirit; but God knows what I mean, and I say no more.\"    \"Alas!\" exclaimed the niece at this, \"may I die if my master does not  want to turn knight-errant again;\" to which Don Quixote replied, \"A  knight-errant I shall die, and let the Turk come down or go up when he  likes, and in as strong force as he can, once more I say, God knows what  I mean.\" But here the barber said, \"I ask your worships to give me leave  to tell a short story of something that happened in Seville, which comes  so pat to the purpose just now that I should like greatly to tell it.\"  Don Quixote gave him leave, and the rest prepared to listen, and he began  thus:    \"In the madhouse at Seville there was a man whom his relations had placed  there as being out of his mind. He was a graduate of Osuna in canon law;  but even if he had been of Salamanca, it was the opinion of most people  that he would have been mad all the same. This graduate, after some years  of confinement, took it into his head that he was sane and in his full  senses, and under this impression wrote to the Archbishop, entreating him  earnestly, and in very correct language, to have him released from the  misery in which he was living; for by God's mercy he had now recovered  his lost reason, though his relations, in order to enjoy his property,  kept him there, and, in spite of the truth, would make him out to be mad  until his dying day. The Archbishop, moved by repeated sensible,  well-written letters, directed one of his chaplains to make inquiry of  the madhouse as to the truth of the licentiate's statements, and to have  an interview with the madman himself, and, if it should appear that he  was in his senses, to take him out and restore him to liberty. The  chaplain did so, and the governor assured him that the man was still mad,  and that though he often spoke like a highly intelligent person, he would  in the end break out into nonsense that in quantity and quality  counterbalanced all the sensible things he had said before, as might be  easily tested by talking to him. The chaplain resolved to try the  experiment, and obtaining access to the madman conversed with him for an  hour or more, during the whole of which time he never uttered a word that  was incoherent or absurd, but, on the contrary, spoke so rationally that  the chaplain was compelled to believe him to be sane. Among other things,  he said the governor was against him, not to lose the presents his  relations made him for reporting him still mad but with lucid intervals;  and that the worst foe he had in his misfortune was his large property;  for in order to enjoy it his enemies disparaged and threw doubts upon the  mercy our Lord had shown him in turning him from a brute beast into a  man. In short, he spoke in such a way that he cast suspicion on the  governor, and made his relations appear covetous and heartless, and  himself so rational that the chaplain determined to take him away with  him that the Archbishop might see him, and ascertain for himself the  truth of the matter. Yielding to this conviction, the worthy chaplain  begged the governor to have the clothes in which the licentiate had  entered the house given to him. The governor again"]]]
