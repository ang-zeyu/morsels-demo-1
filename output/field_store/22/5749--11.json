Why, with so many mounted men some effort was not made to harry the  enemy's retreat, Cox cannot tell me. There were no trenches and the  desert had no limits.    _Now_ (in the train on my way back to Alexandria) I must have one more  try at K. about these Gurkhas! My official cable and letter asking for  the Gurkha Brigade have fallen upon stony ground. No notice of any sort  has been vouchsafed to my modest request. Has _any_ action been taken  upon them? Possibly the matter has been referred to Maxwell for opinion?  If so, he has said nothing about it, which does not promise well. Cox  has heard nothing from Cairo; only no end of camp rumours. Most likely  K. is vexed with me for asking for these troops at all, and thinks I am  already forgetting his warning not to put him in the cart by asking for  too many things. France must not be made jealous and Egypt ditto, I  suppose. I cannot possibly repeat my official cable and my demi-official  letter. The whole is _most_ disappointing. Here is Cox and here are his  men, absolutely wasted and frightfully keen to come. There are the  Dardanelles short-handed; there is the New Zealand Division short of a  Brigade. If surplus and deficit had the same common denominator, say  \"K.\" or \"G.S.\" they would wipe themselves out to the instant  simplification of the problem. As it is, they are kept on separate  sheets of paper;      too many troops        too few troops        Maxwell               Hamilton           *       *       *       *       *    Have just finished dictating a letter to K., giving him an account of my  inspection of the Indian troops and of how \"they made my mouth water,  especially the 6th Gurkhas.\" I ask him if I could not anyway have _them_  \"as a sort of escort to the Mountain Battery,\" and go on to say, \"The  desert is drying up, Cox tells me; such water as there is is becoming  more and more brackish and undrinkable; and no other serious raid, in  his opinion, will be possible this summer.\" I might have added that once  we open the ball at the Dardanelles the old Turks must dance to our  tune, and draw in their troops for the defence of Constantinople but it  does not do to be too instructive to one's Grandmother. So there it is:  I have done the best I can.    _4th April, 1915. Alexandria._ Busy day in office. Things beginning to  hum. A marvellous case of \"two great minds.\" K. has proffered his advice  upon the tactical problem, and how it should be dealt with, and, as I  have just cabled in answer, \"No need to send you my plan as you have got  it in one, even down to details, only I have not shells enough to cut  through barbed wire with my field guns or howitzers.\" I say also, \"I  should much like to have some hint as to my future supply of gun and  rifle ammunition. The Naval Division has only 430 rounds per rifle and  the 29th Division only 500 rounds which means running it fine.\"    What might seem, to a civilian, a marvellous case of coincidence or  telepathy were he ever to compare my completed plan with K.'s cabled  suggestion is really one more instance of the identity of procedure born  of a common doctrine between two soldiers who have worked a great deal  together. Given the same facts the odds are in favour of these facts  being seen eye to eye by each.    Forgot to note that McMahon answered my letter of the 31st personally,  on the telephone, saying he had no objection to my cabling K. or  spreading any reports I liked through my Intelligence, but that he is  not keeper of the _Egyptian Gazette_ and must not quarrel with it as  Egypt is not at war! No wonder he prefers the telephone to the telegram  I begged him to send me if he makes these sort of answers. Egypt is in  the war area and, if it were not, McMahon can do anything he likes. The  _Gazette_ continues to publish full details of our actions and my only  hope is that the Turks will not be able to believe in folly so  incredible.    _5th April, 1915. Alexandria._ Motored after early breakfast to French  Headquarters at the Victoria College. Here I was met by d'Amade and an  escort of Cuirassiers, and, getting on to my Australian horse, trotted  off to parade.    Coming on to the ground, the French trumpeters blew a lively fanfare  which was followed by a roll of drums. Never was so picturesque a  parade, the verdict of one who can let his mind rove back through the  military pageants of India, Russia, Japan, Germany, Austria,  Switzerland, China, Canada, U.S.A., Australia, and New Zealand. Yes,  Alexandria has seen some pretty shows in its time; Cleopatra had an eye  to effect and so, too, had the great Napoleon. But I doubt whether the  townsfolk have ever seen anything to equal the _coup d'oeil_ engineered  by d'Amade. Under an Eastern sun the colours of the French uniforms,  gaudy in themselves, ran riot, and the troops had surely been posted by  one who was an artist in more than soldiering. Where the yellow sand was  broken by a number of small conical knolls with here and there a group,  and here and there a line, of waving palms, there, on the knolls, were  clustered the Mountain Batteries and the Batteries of Mitrailleuses. The  Horse, Foot and Guns were drawn up, Infantry in front, Cavalry in rear,  and the Field Artillery--the famous 75s--at right angles.    Infantry of the Line in grey; Zouaves in blue and red; Senegalese wore  dark blue and the Foreign Legion blue-grey. The Cavalry rode Arabs and  barbs mostly white stallions; they wore pale blue tunics and bright  scarlet breeches.    I rode down the lines of Infantry first and then galloped through the  heavy sand to the right of the Cavalry and inspected them, by d'Amade's  request, at a trot, winding up with the six Batteries of Artillery. On  reaching the Saluting Base, I was introduced to the French Minister  whilst d'Amade presented colours to two Regiments (175th Regiment de  marche d'Afrique and the 4th Colonial Regiment) making a short and  eloquent speech.    He then took command of the parade and marched past me at the head of  his forces. Were all the Houris of Paradise waving lily hands on the one  side, and were these French soldiers on the other side, I would give my  cold shoulder to the Houris.    The Cavalry swung along at the trot to the cadence of the trumpets and  to the clink-clank and glitter of steel. The beautiful, high-stepping  barbs; the trembling of the earth beneath their hoofs; the banner  streaming; the swordsmen of France sweeping past the saluting base;  breaking into the gallop; sounding the charge; charging; _ventre a  terre_; out into the desert where, in an instant, they were snatched  from our sight and changed into a pillar of dust!    High, high soared our hopes. Jerusalem--Constantinople? No limit to what  these soldiers may achieve. The thought passed through the massed  spectators and set enthusiasm coursing through their veins. Loudly they  cheered; hats off; and hurrah for the Infantry! Hurrah, hurrah for the  Cavalry!! Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah for the 75s!!!    At the end I said a few farewell words to the French Minister and then  galloped off with d'Amade. The bystanders gave us, too, the warmest  greetings, the bulk of them (French and Greek) calling out \"d'Amade!\"  and the Britishers also shouting all sorts of things at the pitch of  their voices.    Almost lost my temper with Woodward, my new A.G., and this was the  thusness thereof:--    Time presses: K. prods us from the rear: the Admiral from the front. To  their eyes we seem to be dallying amidst the fleshpots of Egypt whereas,  really, we are struggling like drowning mariners in a sea of chaos;  chaos in the offices; chaos on the ships; chaos in the camps; chaos  along the wharves; chaos half seas over rolling down the Seven Sisters  Road. The powers of Maxwell as C.-in-C., Egypt; of the Sultan and  McMahon, High Commissioner of Egypt, and of myself, C.-in-C., M.E.F.,  not to speak of the powers of our police civil and military, have all to  be defined and wheeled into line. We cannot go rushing off into space  leaving Pandemonium behind us as our Base! I know these things from a  very long experience. Braithwaite believes in the principle as a student  and ex-teacher of students. And yet that call to the front!    We've _got_ to tackle the landing scheme on the spot and quick. Luckily  the problems at Alexandria are _all_ non-tactical; pure A.G. and Q.M.G.  Staff questions; whereas, at present, the problems awaiting me at the  Dardanelles are mainly tactical; G.S. questions. So I am going to treat  G.H.Q. as Solomon threatened to treat the baby; i.e., leave the  Administrative Staff here until they knock their pidgin more or less  into shape and send off the G.S. to pluck _their_ pidgin at the Straits.  The Q. people have still to commandeer offices for Woodward's men, three  quarters of whom stay here permanently to do the casualty work; they  have to formulate a local code of discipline; take up buildings for base  hospitals and arrange for their personnel and equipment; outline their  schemes for getting sick and wounded back from the front; finish up the  loading of the ships, etc., etc., etc., _ad infinitum_. Whilst the Q.  Staff are thus pulling their full weight, the G. Staff will sail off  quickly and put their heads together with the Admiral and his Staff. As  to myself, I'm off: I cannot afford to lose more time in getting into  touch with the sailors, and the scene of action.    All was well until the Commander-in-Chief said he was going, but that  moment arose the good old trouble--the trouble which muddled our start  for the Relief of Chitral and ruined the Tirah Campaign. Everyone wants  to rush off to the excitement of the firing line--(a spasm usually cured  by the first hard fight), and to leave the hum-drum business of the Base  and Line of Communication to shift for itself. Braithwaite, of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19322"],[0,"The Antichrist (#13)"],[1,"master.... Every one knows this, _but nevertheless things remain as  before_. What has become of the last trace of decent feeling, of  self-respect, when our statesmen, otherwise an unconventional class of  men and thoroughly anti-Christian in their acts, now call themselves  Christians and go to the communion-table?... A prince at the head of his  armies, magnificent as the expression of the egoism and arrogance of his  people--and yet acknowledging, _without_ any shame, that he is a  Christian!... Whom, then, does Christianity deny? _what_ does it call  \"the world\"? To be a _soldier_, to be a judge, to be a patriot; to  defend one's self; to be careful of one's honour; to desire one's own  advantage; to be _proud_ ... every act of everyday, every instinct,  every valuation that shows itself in a _deed_, is now anti-Christian:  what a _monster of falsehood_ the modern man must be to call himself  nevertheless, and _without_ shame, a Christian!--      39.    --I shall go back a bit, and tell you the _authentic_ history of  Christianity.--The very word \"Christianity\" is a misunderstanding--at  bottom there was only one Christian, and he died on the cross. The  \"Gospels\" _died_ on the cross. What, from that moment onward, was called  the \"Gospels\" was the very reverse of what _he_ had lived: \"bad  tidings,\" a _Dysangelium_.[14] It is an error amounting to  nonsensicality to see in \"faith,\" and particularly in faith in salvation  through Christ, the distinguishing mark of the Christian: only the  Christian _way of life_, the life _lived_ by him who died on the cross,  is Christian.... To this day _such_ a life is still possible, and for  _certain_ men even necessary: genuine, primitive Christianity will  remain possible in all ages.... _Not_ faith, but acts; above all, an  _avoidance_ of acts, a different _state of being_.... States of  consciousness, faith of a sort, the acceptance, for example, of anything  as true--as every psychologist knows, the value of these things is  perfectly indifferent and fifth-rate compared to that of the instincts:  strictly speaking, the whole concept of intellectual causality is false.  To reduce being a Christian, the state of Christianity, to an acceptance  of truth, to a mere phenomenon of consciousness, is to formulate the  negation of Christianity. _In fact, there are no Christians._ The  \"Christian\"--he who for two thousand years has passed as a Christian--is  simply a psychological self-delusion. Closely examined, it appears  that, _despite_ all his \"faith,\" he has been ruled _only_ by his  instincts--and _what instincts_!--In all ages--for example, in the case  of Luther--\"faith\" has been no more than a cloak, a pretense, a _curtain_  behind which the instincts have played their game--a shrewd _blindness_  to the domination of _certain_ of the instincts.... I have already  called \"faith\" the specially Christian form of _shrewdness_--people  always _talk_ of their \"faith\" and _act_ according to their  instincts.... In the world of ideas of the Christian there is nothing  that so much as touches reality: on the contrary, one recognizes  an instinctive _hatred_ of reality as the motive power, the only motive  power at the bottom of Christianity. What follows therefrom? That even  here, in _psychologicis_, there is a radical error, which is to say one  conditioning fundamentals, which is to say, one in _substance_. Take  away one idea and put a genuine reality in its place--and the whole of  Christianity crumbles to nothingness!--Viewed calmly, this strangest of  all phenomena, a religion not only depending on errors, but inventive  and ingenious _only_ in devising injurious errors, poisonous to life  and to the heart--this remains a _spectacle for the gods_--for those  gods who are also philosophers, and whom I have encountered, for  example, in the celebrated dialogues at Naxos. At the moment when their  _disgust_ leaves them (--and us!) they will be thankful for the  spectacle afforded by the Christians: perhaps because of _this_ curious  exhibition alone the wretched little planet called the earth deserves a  glance from omnipotence, a show of divine interest.... Therefore, let us  not underestimate the Christians: the Christian, false _to the point of  innocence_, is far above the ape--in its application to the Christians a  well-known theory of descent becomes a mere piece of politeness....    [14] So in the text. One of Nietzsche's numerous coinages, obviously  suggested by _Evangelium_, the German for _gospel_.      40.    --The fate of the Gospels was decided by death--it hung on the \"cross.\"...  It was only death, that unexpected and shameful death; it was only  the cross, which was usually reserved for the canaille only--it was only  this appalling paradox which brought the disciples face to face with the  real riddle: \"_Who was it? what was it_?\"--The feeling of dismay, of  profound affront and injury; the suspicion that such a death might  involve a _refutation_ of their cause; the terrible question, \"Why just  in this way?\"--this state of mind is only too easy to understand. Here  everything _must_ be accounted for as necessary; everything must have a  meaning, a reason, the highest sort of reason; the love of a disciple  excludes all chance. Only then did the chasm of doubt yawn: \"_Who_ put  him to death? who was his natural enemy?\"--this question flashed like a  lightning-stroke. Answer: dominant Judaism, its ruling class. From that  moment, one found one's self in revolt _against_ the established order,  and began to understand Jesus as _in revolt against the established  order_. Until then this militant, this nay-saying, nay-doing element in  his character had been lacking; what is more, he had appeared to present  its opposite. Obviously, the little community had _not_ understood what  was precisely the most important thing of all: the example offered by  this way of dying, the freedom from and superiority to every feeling of  _ressentiment_--a plain indication of how little he was understood at  all! All that Jesus could hope to accomplish by his death, in itself,  was to offer the strongest possible proof, or _example_, of his  teachings in the most public manner.... But his disciples were very far  from _forgiving_ his death--though to have done so would have accorded  with the Gospels in the highest degree; and neither were they prepared  to _offer_ themselves, with gentle and serene calmness of heart, for a  similar death.... On the contrary, it was precisely the most  unevangelical of feelings, _revenge_, that now possessed them. It seemed  impossible that the cause should perish with his death: \"recompense\" and  \"judgment\" became necessary (--yet what could be less evangelical than  \"recompense,\" \"punishment,\" and \"sitting in judgment\"!). Once more the  popular belief in the coming of a messiah appeared in the foreground;  attention was rivetted upon an historical moment: the \"kingdom of God\"  is to come, with judgment upon his enemies.... But in all this there was  a wholesale misunderstanding: imagine the \"kingdom of God\" as a last  act, as a mere promise! The Gospels had been, in fact, the incarnation,  the fulfilment, the _realization_ of this \"kingdom of God.\" It was only  now that all the familiar contempt for and bitterness against Pharisees  and theologians began to appear in the character of the Master--he was  thereby _turned_ into a Pharisee and theologian himself! On the other  hand, the savage veneration of these completely unbalanced souls could  no longer endure the Gospel doctrine, taught by Jesus, of the equal  right of all men to be children of God: their revenge took the form of  _elevating_ Jesus in an extravagant fashion, and thus separating him  from themselves: just as, in earlier times, the Jews, to revenge  themselves upon their enemies, separated themselves from their God, and  placed him on a great height. The One God and the Only Son of God: both  were products of _ressentiment_....      41.    --And from that time onward an absurd problem offered itself: \"how  _could_ God allow it!\" To which the deranged reason of the little  community formulated an answer that was terrifying in its absurdity: God  gave his son as a _sacrifice_ for the forgiveness of sins. At once there  was an end of the gospels! Sacrifice for sin, and in its most obnoxious  and barbarous form: sacrifice of the _innocent_ for the sins of the  guilty! What appalling paganism!--Jesus himself had done away with the  very concept of \"guilt,\" he denied that there was any gulf fixed between  God and man; he _lived_ this unity between God and man, and that was  precisely _his_ \"glad tidings\".... And _not_ as a mere privilege!--From  this time forward the type of the Saviour was corrupted, bit by bit, by  the doctrine of judgment and of the second coming, the doctrine of death  as a sacrifice, the doctrine of the _resurrection_, by means of which  the entire concept of \"blessedness,\" the whole and only reality of the  gospels, is juggled away--in favour of a state of existence _after_  death!... St. Paul, with that rabbinical impudence which shows itself in  all his doings, gave a logical quality to that conception, that  _indecent_ conception, in this way: \"_If_ Christ did not rise from the  dead, then all our faith is in vain!\"--And at once there sprang from the  Gospels the most contemptible of all unfulfillable promises, the  _shameless_ doctrine of personal immortality.... Paul even preached it  as a _reward_....      42.    One now begins to see just _what_ it was that came to an end with the  death on the cross: a new and thoroughly original effort to found a  Buddhistic peace movement, and so establish _happiness on earth_--real,  _not_ merely promised. For this remains--as I have already pointed  out--the essential difference between the two religions of _decadence_:  Buddhism promises nothing, but actually fulfils; Christianity promises"]]]
