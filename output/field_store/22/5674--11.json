The Garden of  Paradise blooms there too, and if he is good and holy he shall enter  into it; but if his thoughts are wicked and his heart still full of sin,  he will sink deeper in his coffin than Paradise sank, and I shall only  go once in every thousand years to see if he is to sink deeper or to  rise to the stars, the twinkling stars up there.'          THE MERMAID      Far out at sea the water is as blue as the bluest cornflower, and as  clear as the clearest crystal; but it is very deep, too deep for any  cable to fathom, and if many steeples were piled on the top of one  another they would not reach from the bed of the sea to the surface of  the water. It is down there that the Mermen live.    Now don't imagine that there are only bare white sands at the bottom; oh  no! the most wonderful trees and plants grow there, with such flexible  stalks and leaves, that at the slightest motion of the water they move  just as if they were alive. All the fish, big and little, glide among  the branches just as, up here, birds glide through the air. The palace  of the Merman King lies in the very deepest part; its walls are of coral  and the long pointed windows of the clearest amber, but the roof is made  of mussel shells which open and shut with the lapping of the water. This  has a lovely effect, for there are gleaming pearls in every shell, any  one of which would be the pride of a queen's crown.    The Merman King had been for many years a widower, but his old mother  kept house for him; she was a clever woman, but so proud of her noble  birth that she wore twelve oysters on her tail, while the other grandees  were only allowed six. Otherwise she was worthy of all praise,  especially because she was so fond of the little mermaid princesses, her  grandchildren. They were six beautiful children, but the youngest was  the prettiest of all; her skin was as soft and delicate as a roseleaf,  her eyes as blue as the deepest sea, but like all the others she had no  feet, and instead of legs she had a fish's tail.    All the livelong day they used to play in the palace in the great halls,  where living flowers grew out of the walls. When the great amber windows  were thrown open the fish swam in, just as the swallows fly into our  rooms when we open the windows, but the fish swam right up to the little  princesses, ate out of their hands, and allowed themselves to be patted.    [Illustration: _The Merman King had been for many years a widower, but  his old mother kept house for him; she was a clever woman, but so proud  of her noble birth that she wore twelve oysters on her tail, while the  other grandees were only allowed six._]    Outside the palace was a large garden, with fiery red and deep blue  trees, the fruit of which shone like gold, while the flowers glowed like  fire on their ceaselessly waving stalks. The ground was of the finest  sand, but it was of a blue phosphorescent tint. Everything was bathed in  a wondrous blue light down there; you might more readily have supposed  yourself to be high up in the air, with only the sky above and below  you, than that you were at the bottom of the ocean. In a dead calm you  could just catch a glimpse of the sun like a purple flower with a  stream of light radiating from its calyx.    Each little princess had her own little plot of garden, where she could  dig and plant just as she liked. One made her flower-bed in the shape of  a whale; another thought it nice to have hers like a little mermaid; but  the youngest made hers quite round like the sun, and she would only have  flowers of a rosy hue like its beams. She was a curious child, quiet and  thoughtful, and while the other sisters decked out their gardens with  all kinds of extraordinary objects which they got from wrecks, she would  have nothing besides the rosy flowers like the sun up above, except a  statue of a beautiful boy. It was hewn out of the purest white marble  and had gone to the bottom from some wreck. By the statue she planted a  rosy red weeping willow which grew splendidly, and the fresh delicate  branches hung round and over it, till they almost touched the blue sand  where the shadows showed violet, and were ever moving like the branches.  It looked as if the leaves and the roots were playfully interchanging  kisses.    Nothing gave her greater pleasure than to hear about the world of human  beings up above; she made her old grandmother tell her all that she knew  about ships and towns, people and animals. But above all it seemed  strangely beautiful to her that up on the earth the flowers were  scented, for they were not so at the bottom of the sea; also that the  woods were green, and that the fish which were to be seen among the  branches could sing so loudly and sweetly that it was a delight to  listen to them. You see the grandmother called little birds fish, or the  mermaids would not have understood her, as they had never seen a bird.    'When you are fifteen,' said the grandmother, 'you will be allowed to  rise up from the sea and sit on the rocks in the moonlight, and look at  the big ships sailing by, and you will also see woods and towns.'    One of the sisters would be fifteen in the following year, but the  others,--well, they were each one year younger than the other, so that  the youngest had five whole years to wait before she would be allowed to  come up from the bottom, to see what things were like on earth. But each  one promised the others to give a full account of all that she had seen,  and found most wonderful on the first day. Their grandmother could never  tell them enough, for there were so many things about which they wanted  information.    None of them was so full of longings as the youngest, the very one who  had the longest time to wait, and who was so quiet and dreamy. Many a  night she stood by the open windows and looked up through the dark blue  water which the fish were lashing with their tails and fins. She could  see the moon and the stars, it is true; their light was pale, but they  looked much bigger through the water than they do to our eyes. When she  saw a dark shadow glide between her and them, she knew that it was  either a whale swimming above her, or else a ship laden with human  beings. I am certain they never dreamt that a lovely little mermaid was  standing down below, stretching up her white hands towards the keel.    The eldest princess had now reached her fifteenth birthday, and was to  venture above the water. When she came back she had hundreds of things  to tell them, but the most delightful of all, she said, was to lie in  the moonlight, on a sandbank in a calm sea, and to gaze at the large  town close to the shore, where the lights twinkled like hundreds of  stars; to listen to music and the noise and bustle of carriages and  people, to see the many church towers and spires, and to hear the bells  ringing; and just because she could not go on shore she longed for that  most of all.    Oh, how eagerly the youngest sister listened! and when, later in the  evening she stood at the open window and looked up through the dark blue  water, she thought of the big town with all its noise and bustle, and  fancied that she could even hear the church bells ringing.    The year after, the second sister was allowed to mount up through the  water and swim about wherever she liked. The sun was just going down  when she reached the surface, the most beautiful sight, she thought,  that she had ever seen. The whole sky had looked like gold, she said,  and as for the clouds! well, their beauty was beyond description; they  floated in red and violet splendour over her head, and, far faster than  they went, a flock of wild swans flew like a long white veil over the  water towards the setting sun; she swam towards it, but it sank and all  the rosy light on clouds and water faded away.    The year after that the third sister went up, and, being much the most  venturesome of them all, swam up a broad river which ran into the sea.  She saw beautiful green, vine-clad hills; palaces and country seats  peeping through splendid woods. She heard the birds singing, and the sun  was so hot that she was often obliged to dive, to cool her burning face.  In a tiny bay she found a troop of little children running about naked  and paddling in the water; she wanted to play with them, but they were  frightened and ran away. Then a little black animal came up; it was a  dog, but she had never seen one before; it barked so furiously at her  that she was frightened and made for the open sea. She could never  forget the beautiful woods, the green hills and the lovely children who  could swim in the water although they had no fishes' tails.    The fourth sister was not so brave; she stayed in the remotest part of  the ocean, and, according to her account, that was the most beautiful  spot. You could see for miles and miles around you, and the sky above  was like a great glass dome. She had seen ships, but only far away, so  that they looked like sea-gulls. There were grotesque dolphins turning  somersaults, and gigantic whales squirting water through their nostrils  like hundreds of fountains on every side.    Now the fifth sister's turn came. Her birthday fell in the winter, so  that she saw sights that the others had not seen on their first trips.  The sea looked quite green, and large icebergs were floating about, each  one of which looked like a pearl, she said, but was much bigger than the  church towers built by men. They took the most wonderful shapes, and  sparkled like diamonds. She had seated herself on one of the largest,  and all the passing ships sheered off in alarm when they saw her sitting  there with her long hair streaming loose in the wind.    In the evening the sky became overcast with dark clouds; it thundered  and lightened, and the huge icebergs glittering in the bright lightning,  were lifted high into the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17866"],[0,"Murder in the Gunroom (#13)"],[1," to help her gyp the rest of us.  And before that ...\"    \"Oh, forget it.\" Rand dismissed Geraldine with a shrug. \"I know she was  talking through a highball glass. As far as selling the collection is  concerned, you just let Rivers sell you a bill of something you hadn't  gotten a good look at. He's a smart operator, and he's crooked as a  wagon-load of blacksnakes. Maybe you never realized just how much money  Fleming put into this collection; naturally you wouldn't realize how much  could be gotten out of it again. A lot of this stuff has been here for  quite a while, and antiques of any kind tend to increase in value.\"    \"Well, I want you to know that I'm just as glad as anybody if you can get  a better price out of him than I could.\" Dunmore smiled ruefully. \"I  guess he's just a better poker player than I am.\"    \"Not necessarily. He could see your hand, and you couldn't see his,\" Rand  told him.    \"You going to see Gresham and his friends, this evening?\" Dunmore asked.  \"Well, when you get back, if you find four cars in the garage, counting  the station-wagon, lock up after you've put your own car away. If you  find only three, then you'll know that Anton Varcek's still out, so leave  it open for him. That's the way we do here; last one in locks up.\"          CHAPTER 9      Rand found another car, a smoke-gray Plymouth coupe, standing on the  left of his Lincoln when he went down to the garage. Running his car  outside and down to the highway, he settled down to his regular style of  driving--a barely legal fifty m.p.h., punctuated by bursts of absolutely  felonious speed whenever he found an unobstructed straightaway. Entering  Rosemont, he slowed and went through the underpass at the railroad  tracks, speeding again when he was clear of the village. A few minutes  later, he was turning into the crushed-limestone drive that led up to the  buff-brick Gresham house.    A girl met him at the door, a cute little redhead in a red-striped dress,  who gave him a smile that seemed to start on the bridge of her nose and  lift her whole face up after it. She held out her hand to him.    \"Colonel Rand!\" she exclaimed. \"I'll bet you don't remember me.\"    \"Sure I do. You're Dot,\" Rand said. \"At least, I think you are; the last  time I saw you, you were in pigtails. And you were only about so high.\"  He measured with his hand. \"The last time I was here, you were away at  school. You must be old enough to vote, by now.\"    \"I will, this fall,\" she replied. \"Come on in; you're the first one  here. Daddy hasn't gotten back from town yet. He called and said he'd  be delayed till about nine.\" In the hall she took his hat and coat and  guided him toward the parlor on the right.    \"Oh, Mother!\" she called. \"Here's Colonel Rand!\"    Rand remembered Irene Gresham, too; an over-age dizzy blonde who was  still living in the Flaming Youth era of the twenties. She was an  extremely good egg; he liked her very much. After all, insisting upon  remaining an F. Scott Fitzgerald character was a harmless and amusing  foible, and it was no more than right that somebody should try to keep  the bright banner of Jazz Age innocence flying in a grim and sullen  world. He accepted a cigarette, shared the flame of his lighter with  mother and daughter, and submitted to being gushed over.    \"... and, honestly, Jeff, you get handsomer every year,\" Irene Gresham  rattled on. \"Dot, doesn't he look just like Clark Gable in _Gone with the  Wind_? But then, of course, Jeff really _is_ a Southerner, so ...\"    The doorbell interrupted this slight _non sequitur_. She broke off,  rising.    \"Sit still, Jeff; I'm just going to see who it is. You know, we're down  to only one servant now, and it seems as if it's always her night off, or  something. I don't know, honestly, what I'm going to do....\"    She hurried out of the room. Voices sounded in the hall; a man's and a  girl's.    \"That's Pierre and Karen,\" Dot said. \"Let's all go up in the gunroom, and  wait for the others there.\"    They went out to meet the newcomers. The man was a few inches shorter  than Rand, with gray eyes that looked startlingly light against the dark  brown of his face. He wasn't using a cane, but he walked with a slight  limp. Beside him was a slender girl, almost as tall as he was, with dark  brown hair and brown eyes. She wore a rust-brown sweater and a brown  skirt, and low-heeled walking-shoes.    Irene Gresham went into the introductions, the newcomers shook hands with  Rand and were advised that the style of address was \"Jeff,\" rather than  \"Colonel Rand,\" and then Dot suggested going up to the gunroom. Irene  Gresham said she'd stay downstairs; she'd have to let the others in.    \"Have you seen this collection before?\" Pierre Jarrett inquired as he and  Rand went upstairs together.    \"About two years ago,\" Rand said. \"Stephen had just gotten a cased  dueling set by Wilkinson, then. From the Far West Hobby Shop, I think.\"    \"Oh, he's gotten a lot of new stuff since then, and sold off about a  dozen culls and duplicates,\" the former Marine said. \"I'll show you  what's new, till the others come.\"    They reached the head of the stairs and started down the hall to the  gunroom, in the wing that projected out over the garage. Along the way,  the girls detached themselves for nose-powdering.    Unlike the room at the Fleming home, Stephen Gresham's gunroom had  originally been something else--a nursery, or play-room, or party-room.  There were windows on both long sides, which considerably reduced the  available wall-space, and the situation wasn't helped any by the fact  that the collection was about thirty per cent long-arms. Things were  pretty badly crowded; most of the rifles and muskets were in circular  barracks-racks, away from the walls.    \"Here, this one's new since you were here,\" Pierre said, picking a long  musket from one of the racks and handing it to Rand. \"How do you like  this one?\"    Rand took it and whistled appreciatively. \"Real European matchlock; no,  I never saw that. Looks like North Italian, say 1575 to about 1600.\"    \"That musket,\" Pierre informed him, \"came over on the _Mayflower_.\"    \"Really, or just a gag?\" Rand asked. \"It easily could have. The  _Mayflower_ Company bought their muskets in Holland, from some  seventeenth-century forerunner of Bannerman's, and Europe was full of  muskets like this then, left over from the wars of the Holy Roman Empire  and the French religious wars.\"    \"Yes; I suppose all their muskets were obsolete types for the period,\"  Pierre agreed. \"Well, that's a real _Mayflower_ arm. Stephen has the  documentation for it. It came from the Charles Winthrop Sawyer  collection, and there were only three ownership changes between the last  owner and the _Mayflower_ Company. Stephen only paid a hundred dollars  for it, too.\"    \"That was practically stealing,\" Rand said. He carried the musket to the  light and examined it closely. \"Nice condition, too; I wouldn't be afraid  to fire this with a full charge, right now.\" He handed the weapon back.  \"He didn't lose a thing on that deal.\"    \"I should say not! I'd give him two hundred for it, any time. Even  without the history, it's worth that.\"    \"Who buys history, anyhow?\" Rand wanted to know. \"The fact that it came  from the Sawyer collection adds more value to it than this _Mayflower_  business. Past ownership by a recognized authority like Sawyer is a real  guarantee of quality and authenticity. But history, documented or  otherwise--hell, only yesterday I saw a pair of pistols with a wonderful  three-hundred-and-fifty-year documented history. Only not a word of it  was true; the pistols were made about twenty years ago.\"    \"Those wheel locks Fleming bought from Arnold Rivers?\" Pierre asked.  \"God, wasn't that a crime! I'll bet Rivers bought himself a big drink  when Lane Fleming was killed. Fleming was all set to hang Rivers's scalp  in his wigwam.... But with Stephen, the history does count for  something. As you probably know, he collects arms-types that figured in  American history. Well, he can prove that this individual musket was  brought over by the Pilgrims, so he can be sure it's an example of the  type they used. But he'd sooner have a typical Pilgrim musket that never  was within five thousand miles of Plymouth Rock than a non-typical arm  brought over as a personal weapon by one of the _Mayflower_ Company.\"    \"Oh, none of us are really interested in the individual history of  collection weapons,\" Rand said. \"You show me a collection that's full of  known-history arms, and I'll show you a collection that's either full of  junk or else cost three times what it's worth. And you show me a  collector who blows money on history, and nine times out of ten I'll show  you a collector who doesn't know guns. I saw one such collection, once;  every item had its history neatly written out on a tag and hung onto the  trigger-guard. The owner thought that the patent-dates on Colts were  model-dates, and the model-dates on French military arms were dates of  fabrication.\"    Pierre wrinkled his nose disgustedly. \"God, I hate to see a collection  all fouled up with tags hung on things!\" he said. \"Or stuck over with  gummed labels; that's even worse. Once in a while I get something with a  label pasted on it, usually on the stock, and after I get it off, there's  a job getting the wood under it rubbed up to the same color as the rest  of the stock.\"    \"Yes. I picked up a lovely little rifled flintlock pistol, once,\" Rand  said. \"American; full-length curly-maple stock; really a Kentucky rifle  in pistol form. Whoever had owned it before me had pasted a slip of paper  on the underside of the stock, between the trigger-guard and the lower  ramrod thimble, with a lot of crap, mostly erroneous, typed on it. It  took me six months to remove the last traces of where that thing had been  stuck on.\"    \"What do you collect, or don't you specialize?\"    \"Pistols; I try to"]]]
