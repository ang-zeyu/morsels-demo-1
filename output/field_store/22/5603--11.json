He, of a truth, is the Most Generous, the All-Bountiful.    115 Blessed is he who, at the hour of dawn, centring his thoughts on God,  occupied with His remembrance, and supplicating His forgiveness, directeth  his steps to the Mas{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}riqu'l-Ad{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}kar and, entering therein, seateth  himself in silence to listen to the verses of God, the Sovereign, the  Mighty, the All-Praised. Say: The Mas{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}riqu'l-Ad{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}kar is each and every  building which hath been erected in cities and villages for the  celebration of My praise. Such is the name by which it hath been  designated before the throne of glory, were ye of those who understand.    116 They who recite the verses of the All-Merciful in the most melodious  of tones will perceive in them that with which the sovereignty of earth  and heaven can never be compared. From them they will inhale the divine  fragrance of My worlds--worlds which today none can discern save those who  have been endowed with vision through this sublime, this beauteous  Revelation. Say: These verses draw hearts that are pure unto those  spiritual worlds that can neither be expressed in words nor intimated by  allusion. Blessed be those who hearken.    117 Assist ye, O My people, My chosen servants who have arisen to make  mention of Me among My creatures and to exalt My Word throughout My realm.  These, truly, are the stars of the heaven of My loving providence and the  lamps of My guidance unto all mankind. But he whose words conflict with  that which hath been sent down in My Holy Tablets is not of Me. Beware  lest ye follow any impious pretender. These Tablets are embellished with  the seal of Him Who causeth the dawn to appear, Who lifteth up His voice  between the heavens and the earth. Lay hold on this Sure Handle and on the  Cord of My mighty and unassailable Cause.    118 The Lord hath granted leave to whosoever desireth it that he be  instructed in the divers tongues of the world that he may deliver the  Message of the Cause of God throughout the East and throughout the West,  that he make mention of Him amidst the kindreds and peoples of the world  in such wise that hearts may revive and the mouldering bone be quickened.    119 It is inadmissible that man, who hath been endowed with reason, should  consume that which stealeth it away. Nay, rather it behoveth him to  comport himself in a manner worthy of the human station, and not in  accordance with the misdeeds of every heedless and wavering soul.    120 Adorn your heads with the garlands of trustworthiness and fidelity,  your hearts with the attire of the fear of God, your tongues with absolute  truthfulness, your bodies with the vesture of courtesy. These are in truth  seemly adornings unto the temple of man, if ye be of them that reflect.  Cling, O ye people of Baha, to the cord of servitude unto God, the True  One, for thereby your stations shall be made manifest, your names written  and preserved, your ranks raised and your memory exalted in the Preserved  Tablet. Beware lest the dwellers on earth hinder you from this glorious  and exalted station. Thus have We exhorted you in most of Our Epistles and  now in this, Our Holy Tablet, above which hath beamed the Day-Star of the  Laws of the Lord, your God, the Powerful, the All-Wise.    121 When the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation  is ended, turn your faces toward Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath  branched from this Ancient Root.    122 Consider the pettiness of men's minds. They ask for that which  injureth them, and cast away the thing that profiteth them. They are,  indeed, of those that are far astray. We find some men desiring liberty,  and priding themselves therein. Such men are in the depths of ignorance.    123 Liberty must, in the end, lead to sedition, whose flames none can  quench. Thus warneth you He Who is the Reckoner, the All-Knowing. Know ye  that the embodiment of liberty and its symbol is the animal. That which  beseemeth man is submission unto such restraints as will protect him from  his own ignorance, and guard him against the harm of the mischief-maker.  Liberty causeth man to overstep the bounds of propriety, and to infringe  on the dignity of his station. It debaseth him to the level of extreme  depravity and wickedness.    124 Regard men as a flock of sheep that need a shepherd for their  protection. This, verily, is the truth, the certain truth. We approve of  liberty in certain circumstances, and refuse to sanction it in others. We,  verily, are the All-Knowing.    125 Say: True liberty consisteth in man's submission unto My commandments,  little as ye know it. Were men to observe that which We have sent down  unto them from the Heaven of Revelation, they would, of a certainty,  attain unto perfect liberty. Happy is the man that hath apprehended the  Purpose of God in whatever He hath revealed from the Heaven of His Will  that pervadeth all created things. Say: The liberty that profiteth you is  to be found nowhere except in complete servitude unto God, the Eternal  Truth. Whoso hath tasted of its sweetness will refuse to barter it for all  the dominion of earth and heaven.    126 In the Bayan it had been forbidden you to ask Us questions. The Lord  hath now relieved you of this prohibition, that ye may be free to ask what  you need to ask, but not such idle questions as those on which the men of  former times were wont to dwell. Fear God, and be ye of the righteous! Ask  ye that which shall be of profit to you in the Cause of God and His  dominion, for the portals of His tender compassion have been opened before  all who dwell in heaven and on earth.    127 The number of months in a year, appointed in the Book of God, is  nineteen. Of these the first hath been adorned with this Name which  overshadoweth the whole of creation.    128 The Lord hath decreed that the dead should be interred in coffins made  of crystal, of hard, resistant stone, or of wood that is both fine and  durable, and that graven rings should be placed upon their fingers. He,  verily, is the Supreme Ordainer, the One apprised of all.    129 The inscription on these rings should read, for men: \"Unto God  belongeth all that is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever is  between them, and He, in truth, hath knowledge of all things\"; and for  women: \"Unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and  whatsoever is between them, and He, in truth, is potent over all things\".  These are the verses that were revealed aforetime, but lo, the Point of  the Bayan now calleth out, exclaiming, \"O Best-Beloved of the worlds!  Reveal Thou in their stead such words as will waft the fragrance of Thy  gracious favours over all mankind. We have announced unto everyone that  one single word from Thee excelleth all that hath been sent down in the  Bayan. Thou, indeed, hast power to do what pleaseth Thee. Deprive not Thy  servants of the overflowing bounties of the ocean of Thy mercy! Thou, in  truth, art He Whose grace is infinite.\" Behold, We have hearkened to His  call, and now fulfil His wish. He, verily, is the Best-Beloved, the  Answerer of prayers. If the following verse, which hath at this moment  been sent down by God, be engraved upon the burial-rings of both men and  women, it shall be better for them; We, of a certainty, are the Supreme  Ordainer: \"I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all  save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate.\" Thus  doth the Lord single out whomsoever He desireth for a bounty from His  presence. He is, in very truth, the God of might and power.    130 The Lord hath decreed, moreover, that the deceased should be enfolded  in five sheets of silk or cotton. For those whose means are limited a  single sheet of either fabric will suffice. Thus hath it been ordained by  Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. It is forbidden you to  transport the body of the deceased a greater distance than one hour's  journey from the city; rather should it be interred, with radiance and  serenity, in a nearby place.    131 God hath removed the restrictions on travel that had been imposed in  the Bayan. He, verily, is the Unconstrained; He doeth as He pleaseth and  ordaineth whatsoever He willeth.    132 O peoples of the world! Give ear unto the call of Him Who is the Lord  of Names, Who proclaimeth unto you from His habitation in the Most Great  Prison: \"Verily, no God is there but Me, the Powerful, the Mighty, the  All-Subduing, the Most Exalted, the Omniscient, the All-Wise.\" In truth,  there is no God but Him, the Omnipotent Ruler of the worlds. Were it His  Will, He would, through but a single word proceeding from His presence,  lay hold on all mankind. Beware lest ye hesitate in your acceptance of  this Cause--a Cause before which the Concourse on high and the dwellers of  the Cities of Names have bowed down. Fear God, and be not of those who are  shut out as by a veil. Burn ye away the veils with the fire of My love,  and dispel ye the mists of vain imaginings by the power of this Name  through which We have subdued the entire creation.    133 Raise up and exalt the two Houses in the Twin Hallowed Spots, and the  other sites wherein the throne of your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath been  established. Thus commandeth you the Lord of every understanding heart.    134 Be watchful lest the concerns and preoccupations of this world prevent  you from observing that which hath been enjoined upon you by Him Who is  the Mighty, the Faithful. Be ye the embodiments of such steadfastness  amidst mankind that ye will not be kept back from God by the doubts of  those who disbelieved in Him when He manifested Himself, invested with a  mighty sovereignty.

In addition,  the Amir bound himself to keep up a certain number of regular troops  for the defence of Afghanistan, so long as the war with Persia  continued, in consideration of a monthly subsidy of Rs. 100,000 and  a gift of 4,000 muskets. He also engaged to communicate to the  Government of India any overtures he might receive from Persia, and  he consented to allow British officers to visit certain parts of his  dominions, either for the purpose of assisting his subjects against  Persia, or to ascertain that the subsidy was properly applied.    I have dwelt at some length on this treaty with Afghanistan, first,  because the policy of which this was the outcome was, as I have  already shown, initiated by my father; and, secondly, because I do not  think it is generally understood how important to us were its results.  Not only did it heal the wounds left open from the first Afghan war,  but it relieved England of a great anxiety at a time when throughout  the length and breadth of India there was distress, revolt, bloodshed,  and bitter distrust of our Native troops. Dost Mahomed loyally held  to his engagements during the troublous days of the Mutiny which so  quickly followed this alliance, when, had he turned against us, we  should assuredly have lost the Punjab; Delhi could never have been  taken; in fact, I do not see how any part of the country north of  Bengal could have been saved. Dost Mahomed's own people could not  understand his attitude. They frequently came to him during the  Mutiny, throwing their turbans at his feet, and praying him as a  Mahomedan to seize that opportunity for destroying the 'infidels.'  'Hear the news from Delhi,' they urged; 'see the difficulties the  Feringhis are in. Why don't you lead us on to take advantage of their  weakness, and win back Peshawar?'[3]    But I am anticipating, and must return to my narrative.    The clause of the treaty which interested me personally was that  relating to British officers being allowed to visit Afghanistan,  to give effect to which a Mission was despatched to Kandahar. It  consisted of three officers, the brothers Harry and Peter Lumsden, and  Dr. Bellew, together with two of Edwardes's trusted Native Chiefs. The  selection of Peter Lumsden as a member of this Mission again left the  Deputy Assistant-Quartermaster-Generalship vacant, and I was a second  time appointed to officiate in his absence.    Shortly afterwards the General of the division (General Reed) started  on his tour of inspection, taking me with him as his staff officer.  Jhelum was the first place we visited. Whether the sepoys had then  any knowledge of what was so soon to happen is doubtful. If they had,  there was no evidence that such was the case. Nothing could have  been more proper or respectful than their behaviour; no crimes were  reported, no complaints were made. The British officers, certainly,  had not the slightest idea of the storm that was brewing, for they  spoke in the warmest terms of their men.    From Jhelum we went to Rawal Pindi. John Lawrence happened to be in  camp there at the time, and looked on at the General's inspection.  At the conclusion of the parade he sent his secretary to ask me if  I would like to be appointed to the Public Works Department. I  respectfully declined the offer, though very grateful for its having  been made. Some of my friends doubted the wisdom of my refusing  a permanent civil appointment; but it meant having to give up  soldiering, which I could not make up my mind to do, and though only  officiating, I was already in the department to which of all others I  wished to belong.    Nowshera was the last station we visited. It was the beginning of  April, and getting rather hot for parading troops. I there met for the  first time the present Commander-in-Chief in India, General Sir George  White, who was then a subaltern in the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment.    I recollect the commanding officer of the 55th, the Native Infantry  corps at this station, who had served all his life with clean-looking,  closely-shaven Hindustanis, pointing with a look of contempt, not to  say disgust, to some Sikhs (a certain proportion of whom had been  under recent orders enlisted in regiments of Native Infantry), and  expressing his regret that he could not get them to shave their beards  and cut their hair. 'They quite spoil the look of my regiment,' he  said. In less than two months' time the Hindustanis, of whom the  Colonel was so proud, had broken into open mutiny; the despised Sikhs  were the only men of the regiment who remained faithful; and the  commanding officer, a devoted soldier who lived for his regiment, and  who implored that his men might not have their arms taken away, as he  had 'implicit confidence' in them, and would 'stake his life on their  fidelity,' had blown his brains out because he found that confidence  misplaced.    Towards the end of April I was ordered to report on the capabilities  of Cherat (now well known to all who have been stationed at Peshawar)  as a sanatorium for European soldiers. I spent two or three days  surveying the hill and searching for water in the neighbourhood. It  was not safe to remain on the top at night, so I used to return each  evening to the plain below, where my tent was pitched. On one occasion  I was surprised to find a camp had risen up during my absence quite  close to my tent. I discovered that it belonged to Lieutenant-Colonel  John Nicholson, the Deputy-Commissioner, who was on his tour of  inspection, and very soon I received an invitation to dine with him,  at which I was greatly pleased. John Nicholson was a name to conjure  with in the Punjab. I had heard it mentioned with an amount of  respect--indeed, awe--which no other name could excite, and I was all  curiosity to see the man whose influence on the frontier was so great  that his word was law to the refractory tribes amongst whom he lived.  He had only lately arrived in Peshawar, having been transferred from  Bannu, a difficult and troublesome district ruled by him as it had  never been ruled before, and where he made such a reputation for  himself that, while he was styled 'a pillar of strength on the  frontier' by Lord Dalhousie, he was looked up to as a god by the  Natives, who loved as much as they feared him. By some of them he was  actually worshipped as a saint; they formed themselves into a sect,  and called themselves 'Nicholseyns.' Nicholson impressed me more  profoundly than any man I had ever met before, or have ever met since.  I have never seen anyone like him. He was the beau-ideal of a soldier  and a gentleman. His appearance was distinguished and commanding, with  a sense of power about him which to my mind was the result of his  having passed so much of his life amongst the wild and lawless  tribesmen, with whom his authority was supreme. Intercourse with  this man amongst men made me more eager than ever to remain on the  frontier, and I was seized with ambition to follow in his footsteps.  Had I never seen Nicholson again, I might have thought that the  feelings with which he inspired me were to some extent the result of  my imagination, excited by the astonishing stories I had heard of his  power and influence; my admiration, however, for him was immeasurably  strengthened when, a few weeks later, I served as his staff officer,  and had opportunities of observing more closely his splendid soldierly  qualities and the workings of his grand, simple mind.    [Illustration: BRIGADIER-GENERAL JOHN NICHOLSON, C.B.    _From a painting by J.R. Dicksee, in the possession of the Reverend  Canon Seymour._]    It was the end of April when I returned to Peshawar from Cherat, and  rapidly getting hot. On the strength of being a D.A.Q.M.G., I had  moved into a better house than I had hitherto been able to afford,  which I shared with Lieutenant Hovenden of the Engineers. We were  just settling down and making ourselves comfortable for the long hot  weather, when all our plans were upset by the breaking out of the  Mutiny.

During the months of February, March, and April, rumours  reached us at Peshawar of mysterious _chupattis_ (unleavened cakes)  being sent about the country with the object, it was alleged, of  preparing the Natives for some forthcoming event. There was also an  evident feeling of unrest and dissatisfaction in the minds of the  sepoys. We heard that the 19th Native Infantry at Berhampur, a  military station about 100 miles from Calcutta, had broken open the  bells-of-arms,[1] and forcibly taken possession of their muskets and  ammunition; that a sepoy named Mangal Pandy,[2] belonging to the 34th  Native Infantry at Barrackpore, had attacked and severely wounded  the Adjutant and Sergeant-Major of his regiment; that it was found  necessary to disband the 19th on the 30th March, and the 34th on the  6th May; that bungalows had been burnt in several stations; and  that the sepoys at the Schools of Musketry had objected to use the  cartridges served out with the new rifles, because, it was asserted,  they were greased with a mixture of cow's fat and lard, the one being  as obnoxious to the prejudices of the Hindu as the other is to those  of the Mussulman.    It seems strange on looking back that these many warnings should have  passed almost unheeded, and that there should have been no suspicion  amongst the officers serving with Native regiments that discontent"]]]
