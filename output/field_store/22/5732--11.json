They spend much of their time in needle-work and gossip, sitting like  Turkish sultanas on divans or the floor. They do not rise at your  entrance or departure. They converse in a very loud, unmusical voice. We  never detected bashfulness in the street or parlor. They go to mass  every morning, and make visits of etiquette on Sundays. They take more  interest in political than in domestic affairs. Dust and cobwebs are  unmistakable signs of indifference. Brooms are rarities; such as exist  are besoms made of split stick. Since our return, we have sent to a  Quitonian gentleman, by request, a package of broom-corn seed, which, we  trust, will be the forerunner of a harvest of brooms and cleaner floors  in the high city. Not only the lords, but also the ladies, are  inveterate smokers. Little mats are used for spittoons.    [Illustration: Washerwomen.]    Perhaps Quitonian ladies have too many Indian servants about them to  keep tidy; seven or eight is the average number for a family. These are  married, and occupy the ground floor, which swarms with nude children.  They are cheap, thievish, lazy, and filthy. No class, pure-blood or  half-breed, is given to ablution, though there are two public baths in  the city. Washerwomen repair to the Machangara, where they beat the  dirty linen of Quito over the smooth rocks. We remember but two or  three table-cloths which entirely covered the table, and only one which  was clean. There are but two daily meals; one does not feel the need of  more; they are partaken at nine and three, or an hour earlier than in  Guayaquil. When two unwashed, uncombed cooks bend over a charcoal fire,  which is fanned by a third unkempt individual, and all three blinded by  smoke (for there is no chimney), so that it is not their fault if  capillaries and something worse are mingled with the stew, with onions  to right of them, onions to left of them, onions in front of them, and  _achote_ already in the pot in spite of your repeated anathemas and  expostulations--_achote_, the same red coloring matter which the wild  Indians use for painting their bodies and dyeing their cloth--and with  several aboriginal wee ones romping about the kitchen, keen must be the  appetite that will take hold with alacrity as the dishes are brought on  by the most slovenly waiter imagination can body forth.[29] The aim of  Ecuadorian cookery is to eradicate all natural flavor; you wouldn't know  you were eating chicken except by the bones. Even coffee and chocolate  somehow lose their fine Guayaquilian aroma in this high altitude, and  the very pies are stuffed with onions. But the beef, minus the garlic,  is most excellent, and the _dulce_ unapproachable.    [Footnote 29: We noticed at Riobamba a custom which formerly prevailed  also at Quito. As soon as the guests have finished, and before they have  risen, the Indian waiter kneels devoutly down beside the table, and  offers thanks in a very solemn, touching tone.]          CHAPTER V.         Ecuador.--Extent.--Government.--Religion.--A Protestant Cemetery in       Quito.--Climate.--Regularity of Tropical Nature.--Diseases on the       Highlands.      The republic of Ecuador looks like a wedge driven into the continent  between the Maranon and the Putumayo. It has 1200 miles of Pacific  coast, and an area of about two hundred thousand square miles, including  the Galapagos Islands. Peru, however, claims the oriental half, drawing  her northern boundary from Tumbez through Canelos and Archidona; and she  is entitled to much of it, for she has established a regular line of  steamers on the Maranon, while the Quito government has not developed an  acre east of the Andes. Ecuador is hung between and upon two  cordilleras, which naturally divide it into three parts: the western  slope, the Quitonian valley, and the Napo region. The fluvial system is  mainly made up of the Napo, Pastassa, and Santiago, tributaries of the  Maranon, and the Mira, Esmeraldas, and Guayaquil, flowing westward into  the Pacific. There are no lakes proper, but the natives enumerate  fifty-five lagunes, the largest of which, Capucuy, is not over five  miles long.    Villavicencio tells the world that his country has a total population of  1,308,042. But Dr. Jameson believes it does not exceed 700,000. The  government is based on the Constitution of 1845, amended in 1853. The  president is chosen by a plurality of votes, holds his office for four  years, and has a salary of $12,000. He can not be re-elected,[30] nor  can he exercise his functions more than twenty-five miles from the  capital. But the law is often set aside by those in power. During the  administration of Garcia Moreno, prominent citizens were shot or  banished by his order, without trial by jury. To every plea for mercy  the stern president replied, that as he could not save the country  according to the Constitution, he should govern it according to his own  views of public necessity.    [Footnote 30: Since this was written, Garcia Moreno has been re-elected  to the presidency and the Constitution revised.]    Congress assembles on the 15th of September every other year, and  consists of eighteen senators and thirty representatives. The chambers  are small, and literally barren of ornament. The members sit in two rows  facing each other, have no desks, and give an affirmative vote by a  silent bow. Politics has less to do with principles and parties than  with personalities. Often it has a financial aspect; and the natural  expression on learning of a revolution is, \"Somebody is out of money.\"  The party in feathers its nest as fast as possible; there is scarcely a  public officer who is not open to bribery. The party out plots a  premature resurrection to power by the ladders of corruption, slander,  and revolution.[31] Revolution has so rapidly followed revolution that  history has ceased to count them; and it may be said of them what Milton  wrote of the wars of the Saxon Heptarchy, \"that they are not more worthy  of being recorded than the skirmishes of crows and kites.\" The Grand  Plaza, the heart where all the great arteries of circulation meet and  diverge, is where the high tides of Quito affairs ebb and flow.    [Footnote 31: Government has more than once paid its debts by  repudiation. Congress lately voted to pay only seven per cent. of the  claims against the state which are dated prior to a certain year. Among  the sufferers is the venerable Dr. Jameson, a distinguished foreigner,  who has served this country faithfully for forty years, first as  assayer, then as director of the mint, and always by his scientific  position.]    The Supreme Court consists of five judges. Criminal cases only are tried  by jury; and an attorney is not permitted to question a witness. There  are no penitentiaries: second-class criminals are made to work for the  public, while political offenders are banished to the banks of the Napo,  or to Peru. Here, as in no other country, every man's house is his  castle. No search-warrants are allowed; a policeman can be shot dead on  the threshold. The person and property of a foreigner are safe; and no  native in the employ of a foreigner can be taken by the government for  military purposes. All, except pure Indians, can vote if over  twenty-one, and can read and write. A man's signature is without value  if it lacks his flourish--a custom of Spanish origin.    The permanent army consists of two regiments. The soldiers are mostly  half-breeds, and are generally followed by their wives. They are poorly  paid; and as they are impressed into the service, they carry out the  principle by helping themselves wherever they go. In marching, they have  a quicker step than Northern soldiers. The chief expenditure of the  republic is for the army, about $500,000; the next is for the payment of  the national debt, $360,000. The foreign debt is L1,470,374. Ecuadorians  claim a revenue of a million and a half, of which one half is from the  custom-house, and one fiftieth from the post-office.    One would suppose that the people who breathe this high atmosphere, and  enjoy this delightful climate, and are surrounded by all that is truly  grand and beautiful, would have some corresponding virtues. But we find  that Nature, here as every where, has mingled base and noble elements.  The lofty mountains, bearing in their steadfastness the seal of their  appointed symbol--\"God's righteousness is like the great  mountains\"--look down upon one of the lowest and most corrupt forms of  republican government on earth;[32] their snowy summits preach sermons  on purity to Quitonian society, but in vain; and the great thoughts of  God written all over the Andes are unable to lift this proud capital out  of the mud and mire of mediaeval ignorance and superstition. The  established religion is the narrowest and most intolerant form of  Romanism. Mountains usually have a more elevating, religious influence  than monotonous plains. The Olympian mythology of the Greek was far  superior to the beastly worship on the banks of the Nile. And yet at the  very feet of glorious Chimborazo and Pichincha we see a nation bowing  down to little images of the rudest sculpture with a devotion that  reminds us of the Middle Ages.    [Footnote 32: Asking the late Chilian minister for his view of the rank  of the different South American states, he gave us this order: Chile,  Brazil, Argentine Republic, Venezuela, New Granada, Central America,  Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador.]    [Illustration: Ecclesiastics.]    The belief is called _La Fe_, or the only true one.

(#13)"],[1,"Offa, as we shall relate presently.          THE KINGDOM OF MERCIA    Mercia, the largest, if not the most powerful, kingdom of the Heptarchy,  comprehended all the middle counties of England; and as its frontiers  extended to those of all the other kingdoms, as well as to Wales,  it received its name from that circumstance. Wibba, the son of Crida,  founder of the monarchy, being placed on the throne by Ethelbert, king  of Kent, governed his paternal dominions by a precarious authority;  and after his death, Ceorl, his kinsman, was, by the influence of the  Kentish monarch, preferred to his son Penda, whose turbulent character  appeared dangerous to that prince. Penda was thus fifty years of age  before he mounted the throne; and his temerity and restless disposition  were found nowise abated by time, experience, or reflection. He engaged  in continual hostilities against all the neighboring states; and, by  his injustice and violence, rendered himself equally odious to his own  subjects and to strangers. Sigebert, Egric, and Annas, three kings of  East Anglia, perished successively in battle against him; as did  also Edwin and Oswald, the two greatest princes that had reigned over  Northumberland. At last Oswy, brother to Oswald, having defeated and  slain him in a decisive battle, freed the world from this sanguinary  tyrant. Peada, his son, mounted the throne of Mercia in 655, and lived  under the protection of Oswy, whose daughter he had espoused. This  princess was educated in the Christian faith, and she employed her  influence, with success, in converting her husband and his subjects to  that religion. Thus the fair sex have had the merit of introducing the  Christian doctrine into all the most considerable kingdoms of the Saxon  Heptarchy. Peada died a violent death.[*] His son Wolfhere succeeded to  the government; and, after having reduced to dependence the kingdoms of  Essex and East Anglia, he left the crown to his brother Ethelred,  who, though a lover of peace, showed himself not unfit for military  enterprises. Besides making a successful expedition into Kent, he  repulsed Egfrid, king of Northumberland, who had invaded his dominions;  and he slew in battle Elswin, the brother of that prince. Desirous,  however, of composing all animosities with Egfrid, he paid him a sum of  money as a compensation for the loss of his brother. After a prosperous  reign of thirty years, he resigned the crown to Kendred, son of  Wolfhere, and retired into the monastery of Bardney.[**]         [* Hugo Candidas (p. 4) says, that he was       treacherously murdered by his queen, by whose persuasion he       had embraced Christianity; but this account of the matter is       found in that historian alone.]         [** Bede, lib. v.]  Kendred returned the present of the crown to Ceolred, the son of  Ethelred; and making a pilgrimage to Rome, passed his life there in  penance and devotion. The place of Ceolred was supplied by Ethelbald,  great-grand-nephew to Penda, by Alwy, his brother; and this prince,  being slain in a mutiny, was succeeded by Offa, who was a degree more  remote from Penda, by Eawa, another brother.    This prince, who mounted the throne in 755,[*] had some great qualities,  and was successful in his warlike enterprises against Lothaire, king of  Kent, and Kenwulph, king of Wessex, He defeated the former in a bloody  battle, at Otford upon the Darent, and reduced his kingdom to a state  of dependence; he gained a victory over the latter at Bensington, in  Oxfordshire; and conquering that county, together with that of  Glocester, annexed both to his dominions. But all these successes were  stained by his treacherous murder of Ethelbert, king of the East Angles,  and his violent seizing of that kingdom. This young prince, who is said  to have possessed great merit, had paid his addresses to Elfrida, the  daughter of Offa, and was invited with all his retinue to Hereford, in  order to solemnize the nuptials: amidst the joy and festivity of these  entertainments, he was seized by Offa, and secretly beheaded; and though  Elfrida, who abhorred her father's treachery, had time to give warning  to the East Anglian nobility, who escaped into their own country,  Offa, having extinguished the royal family, succeeded in his design  of subduing that kingdom.[**] The perfidious prince, desirous of  reestablishing his character in the world, and perhaps of appeasing  the remorses of his own conscience, paid great court to the clergy, and  practised all the monkish devotion so much esteemed in that ignorant and  superstitious age. He gave the tenth of his goods to the church;[***]  bestowed rich donations on the cathedral of Hereford, and even made a  pilgrimage to Rome, where his great power and riches could not fail of  procuring him the papal absolution. The better to ingratiate himself  with the sovereign pontiff, he engaged to pay him a yearly donation for  the support of an English college at Rome,[****] and in order to raise  the sum, he imposed a tax of a penny on each house possessed of thirty  pence a year. This imposition, being afterwards levied on all England,  was commonly denominated _Peter's pence_;[*****] and though  conferred at first as a gift, was afterwards claimed as a tribute by the  Roman pontiff.         [* Chron. Sax. p. 59.]         [** Brompton, p. 750, 751, 752.]         [*** Spell. Concil. p 308. Brompton, p. 776.]         [**** Spell. Concil. p. 230, 310, 312.]         [***** Higden, lib. v.]    Carrying his hypocrisy still further, Offa, feigning to be directed by  a vision from heaven, discovered at Verulam the relics of St Alban, the  martyr, and endowed a magnificent monastery in that place.[*] Moved by  al these acts of piety, Malmsbury, one of the best of the old English  historians, declares himself at a loss to determine[**] whether the  merits or crimes of this prince preponderated. Offa died, after a reign  of thirty-nine years, in 794.[***]    This prince was become so considerable in the Heptarchy, that the  emperor Charlemagne entered into an alliance and friendship with him;  a circumstance which did honor to Offa; as distant princes at that time  had usually little communication with each other. That emperor being a  great lover of learning and learned men, in an age very barren of that  ornament, Offa, at his desire, sent him over Alcuin, a clergyman  much celebrated for his knowledge, who received great honors from  Charlemagne, and even became his preceptor in the sciences. The chief  reason why he had at first desired the company of Alcuin, was that he  might oppose his learning to the heresy of Felix, bishop of Urgel, in  Catalonia; who maintained that Jesus Christ, considered in his human  nature, could more properly be denominated the adoptive than the natural  son of God.[****] This heresy was condemned in the council of Francfort,  held in 794, and consisting of three hundred bishops. Such were the  questions which were agitated in that age, and which employed the  attention not only of cloistered scholars, but of the wisest and  greatest princes.[*****]    Egfrith succeeded to his father Offa, but survived him only five  months;[******] when he made way for Kenulph, a descendant of the royal  family. This prince waged war against Kent, and taking Egbert, the king,  prisoner, he cut off his hands, and put out his eyes; leaving Cuthred,  his own brother, in possession of the crown of that kingdom. Kenulph  was killed in an insurrection of the East Anglians, whose crown his  predecessor, Offa, had usurped. He left his son Kenelm, a minor; who was  murdered the same year by his sister Quendrade, who had entertained the  ambitious views of assuming the government.[*******]         [* Ingulph. p. 5. W.

[* Ingulph. p. 7.]         [** Alured. Beverl. p. 87.]          THE KINGDOM OF ESSEX.    This kingdom made no great figure in the Heptarchy; and the history  of it is very imperfect. Sleda succeeded to his father, Erkinwin, the  founder of the monarchy; and made way for his son Sebert, who, being  nephew to Ethelbert, king of Kent, was persuaded by that prince to  embrace the Christian faith.[***] His sons and conjunct successors,  Sexted and Seward, relapsed into idolatry, and were soon after slain in  a battle against the West Saxons. To show the rude manner of living  in that age, Bede tells us,[****] that these two kings expressed great  desire to eat the white bread, distributed by Mellitus, the bishop, at  the communion.[*****] But on his refusing them, unless they would submit  to be baptized, they expelled him their dominions. The names of the  other princes, who reigned successively in Essex, are Sigebert the  little, Sigebert the good, who restored Christianity, Swithelm, Sigheri,  Offa. This last prince, having made a vow of chastity, notwithstanding  his marriage with Keneswitha, a Mercian princess, daughter to Penda,  went in pilgrimage to Rome, and shut himself up during the rest of his  life "]]]
