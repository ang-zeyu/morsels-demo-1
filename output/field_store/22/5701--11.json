As before, the  privateersmen were ready for their foe, and when they came within range  opened fire upon them, first with the long gun and then with the lighter  cannon; but the British rowed on with steady strokes, for they were  seamen accustomed to victory over every European foe, and danger had no  terrors for them. With fierce hurrahs they dashed through the shot-riven  smoke and grappled the brig; and the boarders rose, cutlas in hand,  ready to spring over the bulwarks. A terrible struggle followed. The  British hacked at the boarding-nets and strove to force their way  through to the decks of the privateer, while the Americans stabbed  the assailants with their long pikes and slashed at them with their  cutlases. The darkness was lit by the flashes of flame from the muskets  and the cannon, and the air was rent by the oaths and shouts of the  combatants, the heavy trampling on the decks, the groans of the wounded,  the din of weapon meeting weapon, and all the savage tumult of  a hand-to-hand fight. At the bow the British burst through the  boarding-netting, and forced their way to the deck, killing or wounding  all three of the lieutenants of the privateer; but when this had  happened the boats had elsewhere been beaten back, and Reid, rallying  his grim sea-dogs, led them forward with a rush, and the boarding party  were all killed or tumbled into the sea. This put an end to the fight.  In some of the boats none but killed and wounded men were left. The  others drew slowly off, like crippled wild-fowl, and disappeared in the  darkness toward the British squadron. Half of the attacking force had  been killed or wounded, while of the Americans but nine had fallen.    The British commodore and all his officers were maddened with anger and  shame over the repulse, and were bent upon destroying the privateer  at all costs. Next day, after much exertion, one of the war-brigs was  warped into position to attack the American, but she first took her  station at long range, so that her carronades were not as effective as  the pivot gun of the privateer; and so well was the latter handled, that  the British brig was repeatedly hulled, and finally was actually driven  off. A second attempt was made, however, and this time the sloop-of-war  got so close that she could use her heavy carronades, which put the  privateer completely at her mercy. Then Captain Reid abandoned his brig  and sank her, first carrying ashore the guns, and marched inland with  his men. They were not further molested; and, if they had lost their  brig, they had at least made their foes pay dear for her destruction,  for the British had lost twice as many men as there were in the whole  hard-fighting crew of the American privateer.          THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS         The heavy fog of morning        Still hid the plain from sight,       When came a thread of scarlet        Marked faintly in the white.       We fired a single cannon,        And as its thunders rolled,       The mist before us lifted        In many a heavy fold.       The mist before us lifted,        And in their bravery fine       Came rushing to their ruin        The fearless British line.                   --Thomas Dunn English.      When, in 1814, Napoleon was overthrown and forced to retire to Elba, the  British troops that had followed Wellington into southern France  were left free for use against the Americans. A great expedition was  organized to attack and capture New Orleans, and at its head was placed  General Pakenham, the brilliant commander of the column that delivered  the fatal blow at Salamanca. In December a fleet of British war-ships  and transports, carrying thousands of victorious veterans from the  Peninsula, and manned by sailors who had grown old in a quarter of a  century's triumphant ocean warfare, anchored off the broad lagoons of  the Mississippi delta. The few American gunboats were carried after a  desperate hand-to-hand struggle, the troops were landed, and on December  23 the advance-guard of two thousand men reached the banks of the  Mississippi, but ten miles below New Orleans, and there camped for the  night. It seemed as if nothing could save the Creole City from foes who  had shown, in the storming of many a Spanish walled town, that they were  as ruthless in victory as they were terrible in battle. There were  no forts to protect the place, and the militia were ill armed and ill  trained. But the hour found the man. On the afternoon of the very day  when the British reached the banks of the river the vanguard of Andrew  Jackson's Tennesseeans marched into New Orleans. Clad in hunting-shirts  of buckskin or homespun, wearing wolfskin and coonskin caps, and  carrying their long rifles on their shoulders, the wild soldiery of the  backwoods tramped into the little French town. They were tall men, with  sinewy frames and piercing eyes. Under \"Old Hickory's\" lead they had  won the bloody battle of the Horseshoe Bend against the Creeks; they  had driven the Spaniards from Pensacola; and now they were eager to pit  themselves against the most renowned troops of all Europe.    Jackson acted with his usual fiery, hasty decision. It was absolutely  necessary to get time in which to throw up some kind of breastworks or  defenses for the city, and he at once resolved on a night attack against  the British. As for the British, they had no thought of being molested.  They did not dream of an assault from inferior numbers of undisciplined  and ill-armed militia, who did not possess so much as bayonets to their  guns. They kindled fires along the levees, ate their supper, and then,  as the evening fell, noticed a big schooner drop down the river in  ghostly silence and bring up opposite to them. The soldiers flocked to  the shore, challenging the stranger, and finally fired one or two shots  at her. Then suddenly a rough voice was heard, \"Now give it to them,  for the honor of America!\" and a shower of shell and grape fell on  the British, driving them off the levee. The stranger was an American  man-of-war schooner. The British brought up artillery to drive her off,  but before they succeeded Jackson's land troops burst upon them, and  a fierce, indecisive struggle followed. In the night all order was  speedily lost, and the two sides fought singly or in groups in the  utmost confusion. Finally a fog came up and the combatants separated.  Jackson drew off four or five miles and camped.    The British had been so roughly handled that they were unable to advance  for three or four days, until the entire army came up. When they did  advance, it was only to find that Jackson had made good use of the time  he had gained by his daring assault. He had thrown up breastworks of  mud and logs from the swamp to the river. At first the British tried to  batter down these breastworks with their cannon, for they had many more  guns than the Americans. A terrible artillery duel followed. For an  hour or two the result seemed in doubt; but the American gunners showed  themselves to be far more skilful than their antagonists, and gradually  getting the upper hand, they finally silenced every piece of British  artillery. The Americans had used cotton bales in the embrasures, and  the British hogsheads of sugar; but neither worked well, for the cotton  caught fire and the sugar hogsheads were ripped and splintered by the  roundshot, so that both were abandoned. By the use of red-hot shot the  British succeeded in setting on fire the American schooner which had  caused them such annoyance on the evening of the night attack; but she  had served her purpose, and her destruction caused little anxiety to  Jackson.    Having failed in his effort to batter down the American breastworks,  and the British artillery having been fairly worsted by the American,  Pakenham decided to try open assault. He had ten thousand regular  troops, while Jackson had under him but little over five thousand men,  who were trained only as he had himself trained them in his Indian  campaigns. Not a fourth of them carried bayonets. Both Pakenham and the  troops under him were fresh from victories won over the most renowned  marshals of Napoleon, andover soldiers that had proved themselves on a  hundred stricken fields the masters of all others in Continental Europe.  At Toulouse they had driven Marshal Soult from a position infinitely  stronger than that held by Jackson, and yet Soult had under him a  veteran army. At Badajoz, Ciudad Rodrigo, and San Sebastian they  had carried by open assault fortified towns whose strength made  the intrenchments of the Americans seem like the mud walls built by  children, though these towns were held by the best soldiers of France.  With such troops to follow him, and with such victories behind him in  the past, it did not seem possible to Pakenham that the assault of the  terrible British infantry could be successfully met by rough backwoods  riflemen fighting under a general as wild and untrained as themselves.    He decreed that the assault should take place on the morning of the  eighth. Throughout the previous night the American officers were on  the alert, for they could hear the rumbling of artillery in the British  camp, the muffled tread of the battalions as they were marched to their  points in the line, and all the smothered din of the preparation for  assault. Long before dawn the riflemen were awake and drawn up behind  the mud walls, where they lolled at ease, or, leaning on their long  rifles, peered out through the fog toward the camp of their foes. At  last the sun rose and the fog lifted, showing the scarlet array of the  splendid British infantry. As soon as the air was clear Pakenham gave  the word, and the heavy columns of redcoated grenadiers and kilted  Highlanders moved steadily forward. From the American breastworks  the great guns opened, but not a rifle cracked. Three fourths of the  distance were covered, and the"]]]
