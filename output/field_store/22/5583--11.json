Afterwards, when she brought her picture-book, he asked, \"What horrid  beasts have you there?\" And if his grandmother told them stories, he  always interrupted her; besides, if he could manage it, he would get  behind her, put on her spectacles, and imitate her way of speaking; he  copied all her ways, and then everybody laughed at him. He was soon able  to imitate the gait and manner of everyone in the street. Everything  that was peculiar and displeasing in them--that Kay knew how to imitate:  and at such times all the people said, \"The boy is certainly very  clever!\" But it was the glass he had got in his eye; the glass that was  sticking in his heart, which made him tease even little Gerda, whose  whole soul was devoted to him.    His games now were quite different to what they had formerly been, they  were so very knowing. One winter's day, when the flakes of snow were  flying about, he spread the skirts of his blue coat, and caught the snow  as it fell.    \"Look through this glass, Gerda,\" said he. And every flake seemed  larger, and appeared like a magnificent flower, or beautiful star; it  was splendid to look at!    \"Look, how clever!\" said Kay. \"That's much more interesting than real  flowers! They are as exact as possible; there is not a fault in them, if  they did not melt!\"    It was not long after this, that Kay came one day with large gloves on,  and his little sledge at his back, and bawled right into Gerda's ears,  \"I have permission to go out into the square where the others are  playing\"; and off he was in a moment.    There, in the market-place, some of the boldest of the boys used to tie  their sledges to the carts as they passed by, and so they were pulled  along, and got a good ride. It was so capital! Just as they were in the  very height of their amusement, a large sledge passed by: it was painted  quite white, and there was someone in it wrapped up in a rough white  mantle of fur, with a rough white fur cap on his head. The sledge drove  round the square twice, and Kay tied on his sledge as quickly as he  could, and off he drove with it. On they went quicker and quicker into  the next street; and the person who drove turned round to Kay, and  nodded to him in a friendly manner, just as if they knew each other.  Every time he was going to untie his sledge, the person nodded to him,  and then Kay sat quiet; and so on they went till they came outside  the gates of the town. Then the snow began to fall so thickly that the  little boy could not see an arm's length before him, but still on he  went: when suddenly he let go the string he held in his hand in order  to get loose from the sledge, but it was of no use; still the little  vehicle rushed on with the quickness of the wind. He then cried as loud  as he could, but no one heard him; the snow drifted and the sledge flew  on, and sometimes it gave a jerk as though they were driving over hedges  and ditches. He was quite frightened, and he tried to repeat the  Lord's Prayer; but all he could do, he was only able to remember the  multiplication table.    The snow-flakes grew larger and larger, till at last they looked just  like great white fowls. Suddenly they flew on one side; the large sledge  stopped, and the person who drove rose up. It was a lady; her cloak and  cap were of snow. She was tall and of slender figure, and of a dazzling  whiteness. It was the Snow Queen.    \"We have travelled fast,\" said she; \"but it is freezingly cold. Come  under my bearskin.\" And she put him in the sledge beside her,  wrapped the fur round him, and he felt as though he were sinking in a  snow-wreath.    \"Are you still cold?\" asked she; and then she kissed his forehead.  Ah! it was colder than ice; it penetrated to his very heart, which was  already almost a frozen lump; it seemed to him as if he were about to  die--but a moment more and it was quite congenial to him, and he did not  remark the cold that was around him.    \"My sledge! Do not forget my sledge!\" It was the first thing he thought  of. It was there tied to one of the white chickens, who flew along with  it on his back behind the large sledge. The Snow Queen kissed Kay once  more, and then he forgot little Gerda, grandmother, and all whom he had  left at his home.    \"Now you will have no more kisses,\" said she, \"or else I should kiss you  to death!\"    Kay looked at her. She was very beautiful; a more clever, or a more  lovely countenance he could not fancy to himself; and she no longer  appeared of ice as before, when she sat outside the window, and beckoned  to him; in his eyes she was perfect, he did not fear her at all, and  told her that he could calculate in his head and with fractions, even;  that he knew the number of square miles there were in the different  countries, and how many inhabitants they contained; and she smiled while  he spoke. It then seemed to him as if what he knew was not enough, and  he looked upwards in the large huge empty space above him, and on she  flew with him; flew high over the black clouds, while the storm moaned  and whistled as though it were singing some old tune. On they flew  over woods and lakes, over seas, and many lands; and beneath them the  chilling storm rushed fast, the wolves howled, the snow crackled; above  them flew large screaming crows, but higher up appeared the moon, quite  large and bright; and it was on it that Kay gazed during the long long  winter's night; while by day he slept at the feet of the Snow Queen.      THIRD STORY. Of the Flower-Garden At the Old Woman's Who Understood  Witchcraft    But what became of little Gerda when Kay did not return? Where could he  be? Nobody knew; nobody could give any intelligence. All the boys knew  was, that they had seen him tie his sledge to another large and splendid  one, which drove down the street and out of the town. Nobody knew  where he was; many sad tears were shed, and little Gerda wept long and  bitterly; at last she said he must be dead; that he had been drowned in  the river which flowed close to the town. Oh! those were very long and  dismal winter evenings!    At last spring came, with its warm sunshine.    \"Kay is dead and gone!\" said little Gerda.    \"That I don't believe,\" said the Sunshine.    \"Kay is dead and gone!\" said she to the Swallows.    \"That I don't believe,\" said they: and at last little Gerda did not  think so any longer either.    \"I'll put on my red shoes,\" said she, one morning; \"Kay has never seen  them, and then I'll go down to the river and ask there.\"    It was quite early; she kissed her old grandmother, who was still  asleep, put on her red shoes, and went alone to the river.    \"Is it true that you have taken my little playfellow? I will make you a  present of my red shoes, if you will give him back to me.\"    And, as it seemed to her, the blue waves nodded in a strange manner;  then she took off her red shoes, the most precious things she possessed,  and threw them both into the river. But they fell close to the bank, and  the little waves bore them immediately to land; it was as if the stream  would not take what was dearest to her; for in reality it had not got  little Kay; but Gerda thought that she had not thrown the shoes out far  enough, so she clambered into a boat which lay among the rushes, went  to the farthest end, and threw out the shoes. But the boat was not  fastened, and the motion which she occasioned, made it drift from the  shore. She observed this, and hastened to get back; but before she could  do so, the boat was more than a yard from the land, and was gliding  quickly onward.    Little Gerda was very frightened, and began to cry; but no one heard her  except the sparrows, and they could not carry her to land; but they flew  along the bank, and sang as if to comfort her, \"Here we are! Here we  are!\" The boat drifted with the stream, little Gerda sat quite still  without shoes, for they were swimming behind the boat, but she could not  reach them, because the boat went much faster than they did.    The banks on both sides were beautiful; lovely flowers, venerable trees,  and slopes with sheep and cows, but not a human being was to be seen.    \"Perhaps the river will carry me to little Kay,\" said she; and then  she grew less sad. She rose, and looked for many hours at the beautiful  green banks. Presently she sailed by a large cherry-orchard, where was  a little cottage with curious red and blue windows; it was thatched,  and before it two wooden soldiers stood sentry, and presented arms when  anyone went past.    Gerda called to them, for she thought they were alive; but they, of  course, did not answer. She came close to them, for the stream drifted  the boat quite near the land.    Gerda called still louder, and an old woman then came out of the  cottage, leaning upon a crooked stick. She had a large broad-brimmed hat  on, painted with the most splendid flowers.    \"Poor little child!\" said the old woman. \"How did you get upon the large  rapid river, to be driven about so in the wide world!\" And then the  old woman went into the water, caught hold of the boat with her crooked  stick, drew it to the bank, and lifted little Gerda out.    And Gerda was so glad to be on dry land again; but she was rather afraid  of the strange old woman.    \"But come and tell me who you are, and how you came here,\" said she.    And Gerda told her all; and the old woman shook her head and said,  \"A-hem! a-hem!\" and when Gerda had told her everything, and asked her if  she had not seen little Kay, the woman answered that he had not passed  there, but he no doubt would come; and she told her not to be cast down,  but taste her cherries, and look at her flowers, which were finer than  any in a picture-book, each of which could tell a whole story. She then  took Gerda by the hand, led her into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16042"],[0,"The Wonder Book of Bible Stories (#13)"],[1," now as  weak as other men, and helpless in the hands of his enemies. The  Philistines easily made him their prisoner; and that he might never do  them more harm, they put out his eyes. Then they chained him with  fetters, and sent him to prison at Gaza. And in the prison they made  Samson turn a heavy millstone to grind grain, just as though he were a  beast of burden.    But while Samson was in prison, his hair grew long again; and with his  hair his strength came back to him; for Samson renewed his vow to the  Lord.    One day, a great feast was held by the Philistines in the temple of  their fish-god, Dagon. For they said:    \"Our god has given Samson, our enemy, into our hand. Let us be glad  together and praise Dagon.\"    And the temple was thronged with people, and the roof over it was also  crowded with more than three thousand men and women. They sent for  Samson, to rejoice over him; and Samson was led into the court of the  temple, before all the people, to amuse them. After a time, Samson said  to the boy who was leading him:    [Illustration: _He bowed forward with all his might and pulled the  pillars with him_]    \"Take me up to the front of the temple, so that I may stand by one of  the pillars, and lean against it.\"    And while Samson stood between the two pillars, he prayed:    \"O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and give me strength, only this  once, O God: and help me, that I may obtain vengeance upon the  Philistines for my two eyes!\"    Then he placed one arm around the pillar on one side, and the other arm  around the pillar on the other side; and he said: \"Let me die with the  Philistines.\"    And he bowed forward with all his might, and pulled the pillars over  with him, bringing down the roof and all upon it upon those that were  under it. Samson himself was among the dead; but in his death he killed  more of the Philistines than he had killed during his life.    Then in the terror which came upon the Philistines the men of Samson's  tribe came down and found his dead body, and buried it in their own  land. After that it was years before the Philistines tried again to rule  over the Israelites.    Samson did much to set his people free; but he might have done much  more, if he had led his people, instead of trusting alone to his own  strength; and if he had lived more earnestly, and not done his deeds as  though he was playing pranks. There were deep faults in Samson, but at  the end he sought God's help, and found it, and God used Samson to set  his people free.          THE STORY OF RUTH, THE GLEANER      In the time of the Judges in Israel, a man named Elimelech was living in  the town of Bethlehem, in the tribe of Judah, about six miles south of  Jerusalem. His wife's name was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and  Chilion. For some years the crops were poor, and food was scarce in  Judah; and Elimelech with his family went to live in the land of Moab,  which was on the east of the Dead Sea, as Judah was on the west.    There they stayed ten years, and in that time Elimelech died. His two  sons married women of the country of Moab, one named Orpah, the other  named Ruth. But the two young men also died in the land of Moab; so that  Naomi and her two daughters-in-law were all left widows.    Naomi heard that God had again given good harvests and bread to the land  of Judah, and she rose up to go from Moab back to her own land and her  own town of Bethlehem. The two daughters-in-law loved her, and both  would have gone with her, though the land of Judah was a strange land to  them, for they were of the Moabite people.    Naomi said to them: \"Go back, my daughters, to your own mothers' homes.  May the Lord deal kindly with you, as you have been kind to your  husbands and to me. May the Lord grant that each of you may yet find  another husband and a happy home.\"    Then Naomi kissed them in farewell, and the three women all wept  together. The two young widows said to her:    \"You have been a good mother to us, and we will go with you, and live  among your people.\"    \"No, no,\" said Naomi. \"You are young, and I am old. Go back and be happy  among your own people.\"    Then Orpah kissed Naomi, and went back to her people; but Ruth would not  leave her. She said:    \"Do not ask me to leave you, for I never will. Where you go, I will go;  where you live, I will live; your people shall be my people; and your  God shall be my God. Where you die, I will die, and be buried. Nothing  but death itself shall part you and me.\"    When Naomi saw that Ruth was firm in her purpose, she ceased trying to  persuade her; so the two women went on together. They walked around the  Dead Sea, and crossed the river Jordan, and climbed the mountains of  Judah, and came to Bethlehem.    Naomi had been absent from Bethlehem for ten years, but her friends  were all glad to see her again. They said:    \"Is this Naomi, whom we knew years ago?\"    Now the name Naomi means \"pleasant.\" And Naomi said:    \"Call me not Naomi; call me Mara, for the Lord has made my life bitter.  I went out full, with my husband and two sons; now I come home empty,  without them. Do not call me 'Pleasant,' call me 'Bitter.'\"    The name \"Mara,\" by which Naomi wished to be called means \"bitter.\" But  Naomi learned later that \"Pleasant\" was the right name after all.    There was living in Bethlehem at that time a very rich man named Boaz.  He owned large fields that were abundant in their harvests; and he was  related to the family of Elimelech, Naomi's husband, who had died.    It was the custom in Israel when they reaped the grain not to gather all  the stalks, but to leave some for the poor people, who followed after  the reapers with their sickles, and gathered what was left. When Naomi  and Ruth came to Bethlehem, it was the time of the barley harvest; and  Ruth went out into the fields to glean the grain which the reapers had  left. It so happened that she was gleaning in the field that belonged to  Boaz, this rich man.    Boaz came out from the town to see his men reaping, and he said to  them, \"The Lord be with you\"; and they answered him, \"The Lord bless  you.\"    And Boaz said to his master of the reapers: \"Who is this young woman  that I see gleaning in the field?\"    The man answered: \"It is the young woman from the land of Moab, who came  with Naomi. She asked leave to glean after the reapers, and has been  here gathering grain since yesterday.\"    Then Boaz said to Ruth: \"Listen to me, my daughter. Do not go to any  other field, but stay here with my young women. No one shall harm you;  and when you are thirsty, go and drink at our vessels of water.\"    [Illustration: _Ruth went out into the fields to glean the grain_]    Then Ruth bowed to Boaz, and thanked him for his kindness, all the more  kind because she was a stranger in Israel. Boaz said: \"I have heard how  true you have been to your mother-in-law Naomi, in leaving your own  land and coming with her to this land. May the Lord, under whose wings  you have come, give you a reward!\"    And at noon, when they sat down to rest and to eat, Boaz gave her some  of the food. And he said to the reapers:    \"When you are reaping, leave some of the sheaves for her; and drop out  some sheaves from the bundles, where she may gather them.\"    That evening, Ruth showed Naomi how much she had gleaned, and told her  of the rich man Boaz, who had been so kind to her. And Naomi said:    \"This man is a near relation of ours. Stay in his fields, as long as the  harvest lasts.\" And so Ruth gleaned in the fields of Boaz until the  harvest had been gathered.    At the end of the harvest, Boaz held a feast on the threshing-floor. And  after the feast, by the advice of Naomi, Ruth went to him, and said to  him:    \"You are a near relation of my husband and of his father, Elimelech. Now  will you not do good to us for his sake?\"    And when Boaz saw Ruth, he loved her; and soon after this he took her as  his wife. And Naomi and Ruth went to live in his home; so that Naomi's  life was no more bitter, but pleasant. And Boaz and Ruth had a son,  whom they named Obed; and later Obed had a son named Jesse; and Jesse  was the father of David, the shepherd boy who became king. So Ruth, the  young woman of Moab, who chose the people and the God of Israel, became  the mother of kings.          THE STORY OF DAVID, THE SHEPHERD BOY      Living at Ramah, in the mountains of Ephraim, there was a man whose name  was Elkanah. He had two wives, as did many men in that time. One of  these wives had children, but the other wife, whose name was Hannah, had  no child.    Every year Elkanah and his family went up to worship at the house of the  Lord in Shiloh, which was about fifteen miles from his home. And at one  of these visits Hannah prayed to the Lord, saying:    \"O Lord, if thou wilt look upon me, and give me a son, he shall be given  to the Lord as long as he lives.\"    The Lord heard Hannah's prayer, and gave her a little boy, and she  called his name Samuel, which means \"Asked of God\"; because he had been  given in answer to her prayer.    Samuel grew up to be a good man and a wise Judge, and he made his sons  Judges in Israel, to help him in the care of the people. But Samuel's  sons did not walk in his ways. They did not try always to do justly.    The elders of all the tribes of Israel came to Samuel at his home in  Ramah; and they said to him: \"You are growing old, and your sons do not  rule as well as you ruled. All the lands around us have kings. Let us  have a king also; and do you choose the king for us.\"    This was not pleasing to Samuel. He tried to make the people change  their minds, and showed them what trouble a king would bring them.    But they would not follow his advice. They said: \"No; we will have a  king to reign over us.\"    So Samuel chose as their king a tall young man named Saul, who was a  farmer's son of the tribe of Benjamin. When Saul was brought before the  people he"]]]
