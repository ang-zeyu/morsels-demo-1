Colbert, the  comptroller-general of the finances, was so excellent a manager that the  pressure of taxation was endurable in his time, and he promoted new  manufactures, such as glass at Cherbourg, cloth at Abbeville, silk at  Lyons; he also tried to promote commerce and colonization, and to create  a navy. There was a great appearance of prosperity, and in every  department there was wonderful ability. The Reformation had led to a  considerable revival among the Roman Catholics themselves. The  theological colleges established in the last reign had much improved the  tone of the clergy. Bossuet, Bishop of Meaux, was one of the most noted  preachers who ever existed, and Fenelon, Archbishop of Cambrai, one of  the best of men. A reform of discipline, begun in the convent of Port  Royal, ended by attracting and gathering together some of the most  excellent and able persons in France--among them Blaise Pascal, a man of  marvellous genius and depth of thought, and Racine, the chief French  dramatic poet. Their chief director, the Abbot of St. Cyran, was  however, a pupil of Jansen, a Dutch ecclesiastic, whose views on  abstruse questions of grace were condemned by the Jesuits; and as the  Port-Royalists would not disown the doctrines attributed to him, they  were discouraged and persecuted throughout Louis's reign, more because  he was jealous of what would not bend to his will than for any real want  of conformity. Pascal's famous \"Provincial Letters\" were put forth  during this controversy; and in fact, the literature of France reached  its Augustan age during this reign, and the language acquired its  standard perfection.      7. War in the Low Countries.--Maria Theresa, the queen of Louis XIV.,  was the child of the first marriage of Philip IV. of Spain; and on her  father's death in 1661, Louis, on pretext of an old law in Brabant,  which gave the daughters of a first marriage the preference over the  sons of a second, claimed the Low Countries from the young Charles II.  of Spain. He thus began a war which was really a continuance of the old  struggle between France and Burgundy, and of the endeavour of France to  stretch her frontier to the Rhine. At first England, Holland, and Sweden  united against him, and obliged him to make the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle  in 1668; but he then succeeded in bribing Charles II. of England to  forsake the cause of the Dutch, and the war was renewed in 1672.  William, Prince of Orange, Louis's most determined enemy through life,  kept up the spirits of the Dutch, and they obtained aid from Germany and  Spain, through a six years' terrible war, in which the great Turenne was  killed at Saltzbach, in Germany. At last, from exhaustion, all parties  were compelled to conclude the peace of Nimeguen in 1678. Taking  advantage of undefined terms in this treaty, Louis seized various cities  belonging to German princes, and likewise the free imperial city of  Strassburg, when all Germany was too much worn out by the long war to  offer resistance. France was full of self-glorification, the king was  viewed almost as a demi-god, and the splendour of his court and of his  buildings, especially the palace at Versailles, with its gardens and  fountains, kept up the delusion of his greatness.      8. Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.--In 1685 Louis supposed that the  Huguenots had been so reduced in numbers that the Edict of Nantes could  be repealed. All freedom of worship was denied them; their ministers  were banished, but their flocks were not allowed to follow them. If  taken while trying to escape, men were sent to the galleys, women to  captivity, and children to convents for education. Dragoons were  quartered on families to torment them into going to mass. A few made  head in the wild moors of the Cevennes under a brave youth named  Cavalier, and others endured severe persecution in the south of France.  Dragoons were quartered on them, who made it their business to torment  and insult them; their marriages were declared invalid, their children  taken from them to be educated in the Roman Catholic faith. A great  number, amounting to at least 100,000, succeeded in escaping, chiefly to  Prussia, Holland, and England, whither they carried many of the  manufactures that Colbert had taken so much pains to establish. Many of  those who settled in England were silk weavers, and a large colony was  thus established at Spitalfields, which long kept up its French  character.      9. The War of the Palatinate.--This brutal act of tyranny was followed  by a fresh attack on Germany. On the plea of a supposed inheritance of  his sister-in-law, the Duchess of Orleans, Louis invaded the Palatinate  on the Rhine, and carried on one of the most ferocious wars in history,  while he was at the same time supporting the cause of his cousin, James  II. of England, after he had fled and abdicated on the arrival of  William of Orange. During this war, however, that generation of able men  who had grown up with Louis began to pass away, and his success was not  so uniform; while, Colbert being dead, taxation began to be more felt by  the exhausted people, and peace was made at Ryswick in 1697.      10. The War of the Succession in Spain.--The last of the four great  wars of Louis's reign was far more unfortunate. Charles II. of Spain  died childless, naming as his successor a French prince, Philip, Duke of  Anjou, the second son of the only son of Charles's eldest sister, the  queen of Louis XIV. But the Powers of Europe, at the Peace of Ryswick,  had agreed that the crown of Spain should go to Charles of Austria,  second son of the Emperor Leopold, who was the descendant of younger  sisters of the royal Spanish line, but did not excite the fear and  jealousy of Europe, as did a scion of the already overweening house of  Bourbon. This led to the War of the Spanish Succession, England and  Holland supporting Charles, and fighting with Louis in Spain, Savoy, and  the Low Countries. In Spain Louis was ultimately successful, and his  grandson Philip V. retained the throne; but the troops which his ally,  the Elector of Bavaria, introduced into Germany were totally overthrown  at Blenheim by the English army under the Duke of Marlborough, and the  Austrian under Prince Eugene, a son of a younger branch of the house of  Savoy. Eugene had been bred up in France, but, having bitterly offended  Louis by calling him a stage king for show and a chess king for use, had  entered the Emperor's service, and was one of his chief enemies. He  aided his cousin, Duke Victor Amadeus of Savoy, in repulsing the French  attacks in that quarter, gained a great victory at Turin, and advanced  into Provence. Marlborough was likewise in full career of victory in the  Low Countries, and gained there the battle of Ramillies.      11. Peace of Utrecht.--Louis had outlived his good fortune. His great  generals and statesmen had passed away. The country was exhausted,  famine was preying on the wretched peasantry, supplies could not be  found, and one city after another, of those Louis had seized, was  retaken. New victories at Oudenarde and Malplaquet were gained over the  French armies; and, though Louis was as resolute and undaunted as ever,  his affairs were in a desperate state, when he was saved by a sudden  change of policy on the part of Queen Anne of England, who recalled her  army and left her allies to continue the contest alone. Eugene was not a  match for France without Marlborough, and the Archduke Charles, having  succeeded his brother the Emperor, gave up his pretensions to the crown  of Spain, so that it became possible to conclude a general peace at  Utrecht in 1713. By this time Louis was seventy-five years of age, and  had suffered grievous family losses--first by the death of his only son,  and then of his eldest grandson, a young man of much promise of  excellence, who, with his wife died of malignant measles, probably from  ignorant medical treatment, since their infant, whose illness was  concealed by his nurses, was the only one of the family who survived.  The old king, in spite of sorrow and reverse, toiled with indomitable  energy to the end of his reign, the longest on record, having lasted  seventy-two years, when he died in 1715. He had raised the French crown  to its greatest splendour, but had sacrificed the country to himself and  his false notions of greatness.      12. The Regency.--The crown now descended to _Louis XV._, a weakly  child of four years old. His great-grandfather had tried to provide for  his good by leaving the chief seat in the council of regency to his own  illegitimate son, the Duke of Maine, the most honest and conscientious  man then in the family, but, though clever, unwise and very unpopular.  His birth caused the appointment to be viewed as an outrage by the  nobility, and the king's will was set aside. The first prince of the  blood royal, Philip, Duke of Orleans, the late king's nephew, became  sole regent--a man of good ability, but of easy, indolent nature; and  who, in the enforced idleness of his life, had become dissipated and  vicious beyond all imagination or description. He was kindly and  gracious, and his mother said of him that he was like the prince in a  fable whom all the fairies had endowed with gifts, except one malignant  sprite who had prevented any favour being of use to him. In the general  exhaustion produced by the wars of Louis XIV., a Scotchman named James  Law began the great system of hollow speculation which has continued  ever since to tempt people to their ruin. He tried raising sums of money  on national credit, and also devised a company who were to lend money to  found a great settlement on the Mississippi, the returns from which were  to be enormous. Every one speculated"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/173"],[0,"The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu (#13)"],[1,"to Eltham's room.  The other events are incidental.  The  dogs HAD to be got rid of, for instance; and there is no doubt that  Miss Eltham's wakefulness saved her father a second time.\"    \"But from what?  For Heaven's sake, from what?\"    Smith glanced about into the light-patched shadows.    \"From a visit by someone--perhaps by Fu-Manchu himself,\" he said in a  hushed voice.  \"The object of that visit I hope we may never learn; for  that would mean that it had been achieved.\"    \"Smith,\" I said, \"I do not altogether understand you; but do you think  he has some incredible creature hidden here somewhere?  It would be  like him.\"    \"I begin to suspect the most formidable creature in the known world to  be hidden here.  I believe Fu-Manchu is somewhere inside Redmoat!\"    Our conversation was interrupted at this point by Denby, who came to  report that he had examined the moat, the roadside, and the bank of the  stream, but found no footprints or clew of any kind.    \"No one left the grounds of Redmoat last night, I think,\" he said.  And  his voice had awe in it.    That day dragged slowly on.  A party of us scoured the neighborhood for  traces of strangers, examining every foot of the Roman ruin hard by;  but vainly.    \"May not your presence here induce Fu-Manchu to abandon his plans?\" I  asked Smith.    \"I think not,\" he replied.  \"You see, unless we can prevail upon him,  Eltham sails in a fortnight.  So the Doctor has no time to waste.  Furthermore, I have an idea that his arrangements are of such a  character that they MUST go forward.  He might turn aside, of course,  to assassinate me, if opportunity arose!  But we know, from experience,  that he permits nothing to interfere with his schemes.\"    There are few states, I suppose, which exact so severe a toll from  one's nervous system as the ANTICIPATION of calamity.    All anticipation is keener, be it of joy or pain, than the reality  whereof it is a mental forecast; but that inactive waiting at Redmoat,  for the blow which we knew full well to be pending exceeded in its  nerve taxation, anything I hitherto had experienced.    I felt as one bound upon an Aztec altar, with the priest's obsidian  knife raised above my breast!    Secret and malign forces throbbed about us; forces against which we had  no armor.  Dreadful as it was, I count it a mercy that the climax was  reached so quickly.  And it came suddenly enough; for there in that  quiet Norfolk home we found ourselves at hand grips with one of the  mysterious horrors which characterized the operations of Dr. Fu-Manchu.  It was upon us before we realized it.  There is no incidental music to  the dramas of real life.    As we sat on the little terrace in the creeping twilight, I remember  thinking how the peace of the scene gave the lie to my fears that we  bordered upon tragic things.  Then Caesar, who had been a docile  patient all day, began howling again; and I saw Greba Eltham shudder.    I caught Smith's eye, and was about to propose our retirement indoors,  when the party was broken up in more turbulent fashion.  I suppose it  was the presence of the girl which prompted Denby to the rash act, a  desire personally to distinguish himself.  But, as I recalled  afterwards, his gaze had rarely left the shrubbery since dusk, save to  seek her face, and now he leaped wildly to his feet, overturning his  chair, and dashed across the grass to the trees.    \"Did you see it?\" he yelled.  \"Did you see it?\"    He evidently carried a revolver.  For from the edge of the shrubbery a  shot sounded, and in the flash we saw Denby with the weapon raised.    \"Greba, go in and fasten the windows,\" cried Eltham.  \"Mr. Smith, will  you enter the bushes from the west.  Dr. Petrie, east.  Edwards,  Edwards--\" And he was off across the lawn with the nervous activity of  a cat.    As I made off in an opposite direction I heard the gardener's voice  from the lower gate, and I saw Eltham's plan.  It was to surround the  shrubbery.    Two more shots and two flashes from the dense heart of greenwood.  Then  a loud cry--I thought, from Denby--and a second, muffled one.    Following--silence, only broken by the howling of the mastiff.    I sprinted through the rose garden, leaped heedlessly over a bed of  geranium and heliotrope, and plunged in among the bushes and under the  elms.  Away on the left I heard Edwards shouting, and Eltham's  answering voice.    \"Denby!\" I cried, and yet louder:  \"Denby!\"    But the silence fell again.    Dusk was upon Redmoat now, but from sitting in the twilight my eyes had  grown accustomed to gloom, and I could see fairly well what lay before  me.  Not daring to think what might lurk above, below, around me, I  pressed on into the midst of the thicket.    \"Vernon!\" came Eltham's voice from one side.    \"Bear more to the right, Edwards,\" I heard Nayland Smith cry directly  ahead of me.    With an eerie and indescribable sensation of impending disaster upon  me, I thrust my way through to a gray patch which marked a break in the  elmen roof.  At the foot of the copper beech I almost fell over Eltham.  Then Smith plunged into view.  Lastly, Edwards the gardener rounded a  big rhododendron and completed the party.    We stood quite still for a moment.    A faint breeze whispered through the beech leaves.    \"Where is he?\"    I cannot remember who put it into words; I was too dazed with amazement  to notice.  Then Eltham began shouting:    \"Vernon!  Vernon!  VERNON!\"    His voice pitched higher upon each repetition.  There was something  horrible about that vain calling, under the whispering beech, with  shrubs banked about us cloaking God alone could know what.    From the back of the house came Caesar's faint reply.    \"Quick!  Lights!\" rapped Smith.  \"Every lamp you have!\"    Off we went, dodging laurels and privets, and poured out on to the  lawn, a disordered company.  Eltham's face was deathly pale, and his  jaw set hard.  He met my eye.    \"God forgive me!\" he said.  \"I could do murder to-night!\"    He was a man composed of strange perplexities.    It seemed an age before the lights were found.  But at last we returned  to the bushes, really after a very brief delay; and ten minutes  sufficed us to explore the entire shrubbery, for it was not extensive.  We found his revolver, but there was no one there--nothing.    When we all stood again on the lawn, I thought that I had never seen  Smith so haggard.    \"What in Heaven's name can we do?\" he muttered.  \"What does it mean?\"    He expected no answer; for there was none to offer one.    \"Search!  Everywhere,\" said Eltham hoarsely.    He ran off into the rose garden, and began beating about among the  flowers like a madman, muttering:  \"Vernon!  Vernon!\"  For close upon  an hour we all searched.  We searched every square yard, I think,  within the wire fencing, and found no trace.  Miss Eltham slipped out  in the confusion, and joined with the rest of us in that frantic hunt.  Some of the servants assisted too.    It was a group terrified and awestricken which came together again on  the terrace.  One and then another would give up, until only Eltham and  Smith were missing.  Then they came back together from examining the  steps to the lower gate.    Eltham dropped on to a rustic seat, and sank his head in his hands.    Nayland Smith paced up and down like a newly caged animal, snapping his  teeth together and tugging at his ear.    Possessed by some sudden idea, or pressed to action by his tumultuous  thoughts, he snatched up a lantern and strode silently off across the  grass and to the shrubbery once more.  I followed him.  I think his  idea was that he might surprise anyone who lurked there.  He surprised  himself, and all of us.    For right at the margin he tripped and fell flat.  I ran to him.    He had fallen over the body of Denby, which lay there!    Denby had not been there a few moments before, and how he came to be  there now we dared not conjecture.  Mr. Eltham joined us, uttered one  short, dry sob, and dropped upon his knees.  Then we were carrying  Denby back to the house, with the mastiff howling a marche funebre.    We laid him on the grass where it sloped down from the terrace.  Nayland Smith's haggard face was terrible.  But the stark horror of the  thing inspired him to that, which conceived earlier, had saved Denby.  Twisting suddenly to Eltham, he roared in a voice audible beyond the  river:    \"Heavens!  we are fools!  LOOSE THE DOG!\"    \"But the dog--\" I began.    Smith clapped his hand over my mouth.    \"I know he's crippled,\" he whispered.  \"But if anything human lurks  there, the dog will lead us to it.  If a MAN is there, he will fly!  Why did we not think of it before.  Fools, fools!\"  He raised his voice  again.  \"Keep him on leash, Edwards.  He will lead us.\"    The scheme succeeded.    Edwards barely had started on his errand when bells began ringing  inside the house.    \"Wait!\" snapped Eltham, and rushed indoors.    A moment later he was out again, his eyes gleaming madly.  \"Above the  moat,\" he panted.  And we were off en masse round the edge of the trees.    It was dark above the moat; but not so dark as to prevent our seeing a  narrow ladder of thin bamboo joints and silken cord hanging by two  hooks from the top of the twelve-foot wire fence.  There was no sound.    \"He's out!\" screamed Eltham.  \"Down the steps!\"    We all ran our best and swiftest.  But Eltham outran us.  Like a fury  he tore at bolts and bars, and like a fury sprang out into the road.  Straight and white it showed to the acclivity by the Roman ruin.  But  no living thing moved upon it.  The distant baying of the dog was borne  to our ears.    \"Curse it!  he's crippled,\" hissed Smith.  \"Without him, as well pursue  a shadow!\"      A few hours later the shrubbery yielded up its secret, a simple one  enough: A big cask sunk in a pit, with a laurel shrub cunningly affixed  to its movable lid, which was further disguised with"]]]
