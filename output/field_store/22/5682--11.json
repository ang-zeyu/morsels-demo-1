Among the foreign acts thus ordered the sacred procession occurs  frequently. It started from the temple of Apollo in the Campus Martius  and passed into the city through the Porta Carmentalis, went across the  Forum and then outside the _pomerium_ again to the temple of Ceres, and  then to the temple of Juno Regina on the Aventine. It was therefore a  power from without which came into their city to purify them and to  carry away out of the city again the impurities of which it had rid the  community.    It is also characteristic of such semi-magical things that they lose  their effects after a few applications, and other things must be sought  always more complicated and more strange. Thus from the beginning of the  republic down through the Second Punic War we have a series of  extraordinary measures, growing more and more complicated until in the  religious frenzy of the years after Cannae even human sacrifices are  performed at the command of the books. In this the third century before  Christ deities begin again to be introduced, and it is to this century  that we now turn.    It is probable that the Romans had always worshipped certain powers of  healing, but what their names were under the old regime we do not know,  except that possibly they were connected with the gods of water. At the  close of the kingdom they received, as we have seen, Apollo the divine  healer, Apollo Medicus, and this was originally the only side of his  activity which he exercised at Rome. At various seasons of plague during  the early centuries of the republic they called on him for help, and on  one such occasion (B.C. 431) they built him a temple. But in the course  of time men began to think lightly of the old family physician who had  stood by the Romans during more than two centuries; his methods were too  conservative, they were felt not to be thoroughly up to date. A new god  of healing had appeared in Rome, the Greek god Asklepios, whom myth  called Apollo's son, though originally he had had no connection with  Apollo. His great sanctuary was at Epidauros, and from there his cult  spread over all the Greek world. At first he was known at Rome only in  the worship of private individuals, who had brought him up from the  Greek colonies of Southern Italy, probably Tarentum or Metapontum; but  his cult was contagious, and the stories of his miraculous cures were  eagerly heard. It is no wonder then that in the presence of a great  pestilence in B.C. 293, when the Sibylline books were consulted, \"it was  found in the books,\" as Livy says, \"that Aesculapius must be brought to  Rome from Epidauros.\" The war with Pyrrhus however was on, and nothing  could be done that year except the setting apart of a solemn day of  prayer and supplication to Aesculapius. It is interesting to observe how  much the Romans have changed since the time exactly two centuries before  (B.C. 493), when Ceres and her companions, the first gods introduced by  the books, received their temple. That was the acknowledgment of gods  well known at Rome, and even then they were immediately identified with  already existing Roman gods; now they actually send an expedition not  only outside of Rome but of Italy itself to bring in the cult of a god  whom they accept by his Greek name. In the following year (B.C. 292) the  expedition started for Epidauros to bring back the god, that is the  sacred snake which was both his symbol and his visible presence. Such an  importation of a sacred snake from Epidauros is not unique in the case  of Rome, but was the normal method of establishing a branch cult. Snakes  were kept at Epidauros for just this purpose, and many branches were  thus established. It is an extremely interesting question as to the  practical medical value of the methods of healing practised at Epidauros  and its branches. For a long time those best fitted to express a  technical opinion, modern physicians who examined the matter, found  nothing good in them, and their opinion seems to receive confirmation  from some of the inscriptions recently discovered at Epidauros, which  tell the most extraordinary tales of miraculous cures. And yet many of  these tales are not intended as actual facts, but rather as pious  legends, proclaimed for the edification of the devout, in order that  their faith might be quickened. Before we condemn the whole affair, we  must realise two facts; one is that some of the most able minds of  Greece, men who were otherwise by no means remarkable for their  religious faith, believed implicitly in Epidauros and went there to be  cured; and the other is that the miraculous action of the god was always  supplemented by medicines, in which there may well have been some real  value.    We are told too much rather than too little about this embassy to  Epidauros, for the atmosphere of this third century is different from  that of the early republic. Greek literature was beginning to influence  Rome, and those generations were being born who were to be the pioneers  in Roman literature. Thus Roman mythology was commencing along Greek  lines and with Greek models, and one of the points where legend grew  thickest and fastest is in this coming of Aesculapius. The plain facts  are evidently that the committee went to Epidauros, obtained the snake,  brought it back safely to Rome, and established the sanctuary on the  island in the Tiber, where a temple was built and dedicated January 1,  B.C. 291. Probably this was the first use to which the island had ever  been put, and from this time dates the first bridge connecting it with  the city; the other bridge, to the right bank, was much later. The  Romans had always considered the island a disadvantage rather than an  advantage. Even in legend it was cursed, for it sprang from the wheat of  the Tarquins. They had always desired to be cut off from it, and had  always feared lest it might act as a means of approach for the enemy  from the opposite bank. The few real facts of Aesculapius's coming grew  into a romantic account of how, to the great surprise and terror of the  sailors, the snake went of its own accord into the Roman ship; and how  it stayed aboard until they reached Antium, and then suddenly swam  ashore and coiled itself up in a sacred palm tree in the enclosure of  the temple of Apollo there; and how, when they were in despair of ever  getting it back again, it returned peaceably to them at the end of three  days, and all went well on the journey to Ostia and up the Tiber until  they were passing the island, when the snake went ashore to make its  permanent home there.    It was a pretty fancy which at a later date formed the island into the  likeness of a boat by building a prow and stem of travertine at either  end, the traces of which may still be seen; and it is a curious instance  of the many survivals of ancient Rome in the modern city, that the  Hospital of S. Bartolommeo stands on the site of the old Aesculapius  sanctuary, and so far as we can tell, twenty-two centuries of suffering  humanity have had the burden of their pain lightened there, in  uninterrupted succession since that new year's day, above three hundred  years before Christ, when the hospital of Aesculapius of Epidauros was  formally opened.    The coming of the god of healing in the opening years of the third  century may well be regarded as an omen of the great suffering which  that century was to bring to Rome. It was a century of almost  uninterrupted warfare: first the Samnite war; then the war with Pyrrhus  and Rome's conquest of Southern Italy; then after a breathing spell of  about a decade the first war with Carthage, and Rome's bitter  apprenticeship in fighting at sea; then campaigns in Cisalpine Gaul; and  finally the war with Hannibal roughly filling the last two decades, the  most fearful contest in all Rome's history, with her most terrible enemy  in her own land of Italy. It is little to be wondered at therefore that  this was in the main a century of religious depression, a time when the  fear of the gods filled every man's heart and when every trifling  apparent irregularity in the course of nature was exaggerated into a  portent declaring the wrath of the gods and needing some immediate and  extraordinary propitiation. It is in just such a moment as this in the  middle of the century (B.C. 249) that the next recorded instance of new  gods occurs. The first war with Carthage was in progress, Rome had just  suffered a terrible defeat off the north-western point of Sicily, at  Drepana, a defeat all the more hideous because it was supposed to have  been caused by the impiety of the Consul Clodius, who, hearing that the  sacred chickens would not eat, perpetrated his grim jest by saying \"let  them drink then instead,\" and drowning them all. But to cap it all the  wall of Rome was struck by lightning. Then action was necessary and the  books were consulted. They ordered that sacrifice should be made to Dis  and Proserpina, a black steer to Dis, and a black cow to Proserpina,  three successive nights, out on the Campus Martius, at an altar which  was called the _Tarentum_, and that the ceremony should be repeated at  the end of a hundred years. Here the myth-makers of later times have  been even more busily at work than they were in the case of Aesculapius.  The Aesculapius story was fitted out by them merely with a few  miraculous details, a few legendary ornaments, but the story of Dis and  Proserpina was so covered with their fabrications that it has only  recently been freed from them and seen in its true light, and certain  phases were so absolutely perverted that there are still a number of  very difficult points.
