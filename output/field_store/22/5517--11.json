Note: Level 3 requests a hard effort for a brain and at the same time, the  personal advantage from such effort is not too high. Thus, the absolute  majority of the population is on level 1 and 2.    The persons able to stay on level 3 are the elite of a group.    Example: let's see an example involving car driving. On level 1, a driver is  reacting only when a situation occurs, or is about to occur. On level 2, a  driver is able to predict what the other drivers will do beforehand. On level  3, a driver is able to understand every driver around him, and he is also able  to take in account some possible problems, which can occur in association with  the overall traffic problems. Of course, the best drivers are those on level  3, but the effort to stay on level 3 is so big, that, at some moments, the  brain will not be able to do such an effort, and the driver  \"drops\" on level  1, when he can cause accidents. This could be the explanation of some  \"inexplicable\" accidents, with persons who are considered as very good from a  professional point of view. Of course, this is a very general problem; it is  not related only with car drivers.    We already defined the elite of a group as those persons who are able to stay  on level 3. Let's consider that a person has to work in a position where one  has to take care of the community. Such persons must anticipate what problems  could occur in future, to be able to protect the community. Level 3 is  absolutely necessary. But, there is a problem. When a person is to be selected  for such a job, he has to gain some abilities.  The problem here is that such  abilities are, usually, obtained after some specific training.    The training courses have, as main goal, to ensure that the students have  assimilated a number of models. When a problem associated with such models  occurs, they will activate the suitable model, and so they will solve the  problem. But, to be able to do the job in a good way, the main quality is not  to have the right model, when the problem occurs, but to anticipate fast  enough, what kind of problem will occur. That is, to be on level 3. I never  heard that the selection of personnel is done based also on the level of  consciousness criterion. Even worse, the persons who are able to assimilate  easily new models, have a reduced capacity to make their own models (as level  3 requires) and so, the present system of education stimulates the students to  have a low level of consciousness.    The present level of development of the human brain is too low to have, on a  large scale, a level 3 of symbolic consciousness.    The consciousness based on symbolic models is requested in any situation when  an elite group is necessary. In such a situation, every individual of the  group is associated with a symbolic element. Such a symbolic element contains  nothing which could be associated with the \"human\" part of an individual (no  emotions, no feelings, no love and so on).    Let's see now the consciousness in the animal world. Some superior animals,  which live in packs, know their position in the pack. So, there is a form of  level 2 image consciouness for such animals. Of course, such a level is  associated with a single model, which is made by every individual of the pack.  Even more, the position of every individual could be changed in time.    But what about ants. There is very little probability that an ant is able to  make models in interaction with the external reality. The ants are based on  the models of their PSM, (which are ready made when they are born). For  instance, level-2 of consciousness could be recognized when there is a  competition between the members of the group, as it happens in a pack of  mammals, or when an individual has to be trained. Such things cannot be met in  the world of the ants. Thus, ants have no consciousness (except level 0) as a  result of their incapacity to make models on their own.    Some superior animals, which live in association with human beings  (e.g.  dogs), are able to create on their own some models of interaction with the  human beings. So, they could have level 2 consciousness.        ABSTRACT: MODEL DICTIONARY    M: these are models associated in a direct way with sense organs (M-eyes, M-  ears and so on).    YM: concept models directly or indirectly associated with different entities  of the external reality.    ZM: General long-range models. For any external reality, the brain makes one  or more ZM-models.  They generate the truths, the reality, the knowledge and  the consciousness.    ZM-models are activated by the associated external reality. There are also ZM-  models that are not associated to an external reality (e.g. when we solve a  problem of mathematics).    Any ZM-model associated to an external reality works in association with some  M-models, and also in assocition with any other ZM-model.    MZM: this term is not associated with a model, but with a structure of  different ZM, YM, ZAM, and AZM models. These models are very often used  together. Such a structure is generated by the technological implementation of  the brain, and it optimizes the activity of the brain in a section of the  external reality.    ZAM: these models are long-range models used to modify the external reality.  They are artificial models (they are not generated by direct interaction with  the external reality) and they are also invariant (they cannot be changed by  direct interaction with the external reality).    AZM: these models are associated with the organs that can interact with the  external reality (hands, legs and so on) in a direct way.    XZM: these models are called also \"illegal models\", because they are not  included in the normal structure of models. A normal model is a model for  which any prediction is accepted in a harmonic/logic way by any other model of  the structure. XZMs are, thus, individual models which have no normal  communication with other models. Thus, a brain is not able to detect such  models. In some situations, such models can become active and gain control of  the being. They can also transmit some information to the normal structure of  models.    WBAM (would be-active models): such models are artificial models that are  generated by a ZM-model. Thus, a ZM-model predicts a situation for which there  is no normal model. If a new external reality occurs, and there is no normal  model to understand it, the PSM is activated. A ZM-model can make a WBAM-  model, based on its predictions, so that, when the new external reality  occurs, the ZM will activate that WBAM and so PSM is not activated.    SHIELDING MODELS: Any model has the tendency to become stable. There are some  models which cannot become stable. Such models can destabilize the whole  structure of models due to some infinite loops performed in order to gain  stability (the model with problems will activate some other models, including  the PSM, in a continuous way). A shielding model is created by the main ZM. It  intercepts some truths which can activate some other models (incuding the PSM)  and transmits to the model with problems some information which stabilizes it.  The reality generated by a shielding model is called \"illusion\". The best  known shielding-model is religion. This shielding model stabilizes any model  which predicts the death of the person so it blocks the activation of the PSM.    STORY-TYPE MODELS: Faced with a new external reality, the normal tendency of  the brain is to make a normal model, or to activate a suitable model from its  collection of models. But, when the external reality is changing very fast,  this procedure cannot be followed. In this case, the brain records the  information based on short-range models. These short-range models are  connected between them based on the order of occurence. Such a model (string-  type) is called \"story-type model\". Story-type models are used later (\"off  line\") to make or improve the normal models.      PROTECTION AND SURVIVAL MODEL (PSM)    This is the fundamental image model of any brain. When a new being is born,  the brain contains only the PSM. The PSM contains a collection of basic short  range models (e.g. reflex actions) and long-range models (e.g. the instincts)  for a minimal protection of that being and to ensure the unconditional  survival of that being, forever (these are the basic design features).    The PSM contains also a model of the external body (bones, muscles, and so on)  and also some basic models of interaction with the external reality (e.g. the  model to follow with the eyes the movement of an entity from external reality,  or the model to touch an entity from external reality, which is in the range  of the hand). There are also some models to ensure the equilibrium of the  physical body.    Faced with a new external reality, the PSM is activated and it tries to solve  the problem, based on its short-range models (e.g. reflex actions), but it  will also create a new element, which is associated to the new external  reality. Once the new element is created by PSM, this element is self-  developing as a model, in order to understand the new external reality. When  such an external reality occurs again, the specialized model created during  the first occurence of the new external reality will be activated instead of  the PSM. Such models are normal models (they do not belong to PSM).    Thus, as a new born being gains experience, the PSM will not be activated, but  the models previously created in the interaction of that being with the  external reality.    A model, which belongs to PSM, cannot be changed regardless of the information  received from external reality (the PSM contains only invariant models). In  special conditions, e.g. when a big danger exists for the being (as detected  by PSM), it is possible that a new model enters the PSM.

I shall recover, dost thou tell me,  Through this insane, chaotic play?  From an old hag shall I demand assistance?  And will her foul mess take away  Full thirty years from my existence?  Woe's me, canst thou naught better find!  Another baffled hope must be lamented:  Has Nature, then, and has a noble mind  Not any potent balsam yet invented?    MEPHISTOPHELES    Once more, my friend, thou talkest sensibly.  There is, to make thee young, a simpler mode and apter;  But in another book 'tis writ for thee,  And is a most eccentric chapter.    FAUST    Yet will I know it.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Good! the method is revealed  Without or gold or magic or physician.  Betake thyself to yonder field,  There hoe and dig, as thy condition;  Restrain thyself, thy sense and will  Within a narrow sphere to flourish;  With unmixed food thy body nourish;  Live with the ox as ox, and think it not a theft  That thou manur'st the acre which thou reapest;--  That, trust me, is the best mode left,  Whereby for eighty years thy youth thou keepest!    FAUST    I am not used to that; I cannot stoop to try it--  To take the spade in hand, and ply it.  The narrow being suits me not at all.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Then to thine aid the witch must call.    FAUST    Wherefore the hag, and her alone?  Canst thou thyself not brew the potion?    MEPHISTOPHELES    That were a charming sport, I own:  I'd build a thousand bridges meanwhile, I've a notion.  Not Art and Science serve, alone;  Patience must in the work be shown.  Long is the calm brain active in creation;  Time, only, strengthens the fine fermentation.  And all, belonging thereunto,  Is rare and strange, howe'er you take it:  The Devil taught the thing, 'tis true,  And yet the Devil cannot make it.  (_Perceiving the Animals_)  See, what a delicate race they be!  That is the maid! the man is he!  (_To the Animals_)  It seems the mistress has gone away?    THE ANIMALS    Carousing, to-day!  Off and about,  By the chimney out!    MEPHISTOPHELES    What time takes she for dissipating?    THE ANIMALS    While we to warm our paws are waiting.    MEPHISTOPHELES (_to_ FAUST)    How findest thou the tender creatures?    FAUST    Absurder than I ever yet did see.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Why, just such talk as this, for me,  Is that which has the most attractive features!    (_To the Animals_)    But tell me now, ye cursed puppets,  Why do ye stir the porridge so?    THE ANIMALS    We're cooking watery soup for beggars.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Then a great public you can show.    THE HE-APE    (_comes up and fawns on_ MEPHISTOPHELES)         O cast thou the dice!       Make me rich in a trice,       Let me win in good season!       Things are badly controlled,       And had I but gold,       So had I my reason.    MEPHISTOPHELES    How would the ape be sure his luck enhances.  Could he but try the lottery's chances!    (_In the meantime the young apes have been playing with a  large ball, which they now roll forward_.)    THE HE-APE         The world's the ball:       Doth rise and fall,       And roll incessant:       Like glass doth ring,       A hollow thing,--       How soon will't spring,       And drop, quiescent?       Here bright it gleams,       Here brighter seems:       I live at present!       Dear son, I say,       Keep thou away!       Thy doom is spoken!       'Tis made of clay,       And will be broken.    MEPHISTOPHELES    What means the sieve?    THE HE-APE (_taking it down_)         Wert thou the thief,       I'd know him and shame him.    (_He runs to the_ SHE-APE, _and lets her look through it_.)         Look through the sieve!       Know'st thou the thief,       And darest not name him?    MEPHISTOPHELES (_approaching the fire)_    And what's this pot?    HE-APE AND SHE-APE         The fool knows it not!       He knows not the pot,       He knows not the kettle!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Impertinent beast!    THE HE-APE    Take the brush here, at least,  And sit down on the settle!    (_He invites_ MEPHISTOPHELES _to sit down_.)    FAUST    (_who during all this time has been standing before a mirror,  now approaching and now retreating from it_)    What do I see? What heavenly form revealed  Shows through the glass from Magic's fair dominions!  O lend me, Love, the swiftest of thy pinions,  And bear me to her beauteous field!  Ah, if I leave this spot with fond designing,  If I attempt to venture near,  Dim, as through gathering mist, her charms appear!--  A woman's form, in beauty shining!  Can woman, then, so lovely be?  And must I find her body, there reclining,  Of all the heavens the bright epitome?  Can Earth with such a thing be mated?    MEPHISTOPHELES    Why, surely, if a God first plagues Himself six days,  Then, self-contented, _Bravo_! says,  Must something clever be created.  This time, thine eyes be satiate!  I'll yet detect thy sweetheart and ensnare her,  And blest is he, who has the lucky fate,  Some day, as bridegroom, home to bear her.    (FAUST _gazes continually in the mirror_. MEPHISTOPHELES,  _stretching himself out on the settle, and playing with the  brush, continues to speak_.)    So sit I, like the King upon his throne:  I hold the sceptre, here,--and lack the crown alone.    THE ANIMALS    (_who up to this time have been making all kinds of fantastic  movements together bring a crown to_ MEPHISTOPHELES  _with great noise_.)         O be thou so good       With sweat and with blood       The crown to belime!    (_They handle the crown awkwardly and break it into two  pieces, with which they spring around_.)         'Tis done, let it be!       We speak and we see,       We hear and we rhyme!    FAUST (_before the mirror_)    Woe's me! I fear to lose my wits.    MEPHISTOPHELES (_pointing to the Animals_)    My own head, now, is really nigh to sinking.    THE ANIMALS         If lucky our hits,       And everything fits,       'Tis thoughts, and we're thinking!    FAUST (_as above_)    My bosom burns with that sweet vision;  Let us, with speed, away from here!    MEPHISTOPHELES (_in the same attitude_)    One must, at least, make this admission--  They're poets, genuine and sincere.    (_The caldron, which the_ SHE-APE _has up to this time neglected  to watch, begins to boil over: there ensues a great flame_,  _which blazes out the chimney. The_ WITCH _comes careering  down through the flame, with terrible cries_.)    THE WITCH         Ow! ow! ow! ow!       The damned beast--the cursed sow!       To leave the kettle, and singe the Frau!       Accursed fere!    (_Perceiving_ FAUST _and_ MEPHISTOPHELES.)         What is that here?       Who are you here?       What want you thus?       Who sneaks to us?       The fire-pain       Burn bone and brain!    (_She plunges the skimming-ladle into the caldron, and scatters  flames towards_ FAUST, MEPHISTOPHELES, _and the Animals.  The Animals whimper_.)    MEPHISTOPHELES    (_reversing the brush, which he has been holding in his hand,  and striding among the jars and glasses_)         In two! in two!       There lies the brew!       There lies the glass!       The joke will pass,       As time, foul ass!       To the singing of thy crew.    (_As the_ WITCH _starts back, full of wrath and horror_)    Ha! know'st thou me? Abomination, thou!  Know'st thou, at last, thy Lord and Master?  What hinders me from smiting now  Thee and thy monkey-sprites with fell disaster?  Hast for the scarlet coat no reverence?  Dost recognize no more the tall cock's-feather?
