In Philippe's reign, however, merit found its  reward, no matter how low the origin from whence it sprang, and several  authors, particularly poets, wrote boldly against the extreme hypocrisy  which existed in the preceding reign, and literature made great  progress.    In 1285 Philippe the Fair, so named on account of his handsome person,  succeeded to the throne of his father; in his ardent thirst for money he  changed the value of the coinage three times, and caused a riot which  ended by his hanging twenty-eight of the conspirators at the different  entrances of Paris, and had numbers of persons accused of crimes in  order to have them executed that he might obtain possession of their  property; thus hundreds were burned alive and tortured in various  manners. One act, however, threw a degree of lustre on his reign, and  that was the organisation of the Parliament at Paris, establishing it as  a sovereign court, their sittings being held in the Palais de Justice,  the residence at that period of the kings of France. For several  succeeding reigns Paris appeared to make but little progress; some  churches were built as also other establishments, but none which are now  standing, except some portions of them which may have escaped  destruction and are now in the occupation of different tradespeople. The  government became exceedingly poor, and several measures were adopted in  order to repair the finances of the state; amongst others, that of  suffering serfs to purchase their emancipation, of which many availed  themselves, but not sufficient effectually to replenish the exhausted  treasury. For the same reason the property of the Lombards was  confiscated, next recourse was had to the Jews, and even the exactions  imposed upon them were inadequate to the wants of the nation. The  succession of several weak kings had brought affairs into this state,  when Philippe the Sixth of Valois crowned the misfortunes of the country  by entering into a war with England, at a time when the funds of his  kingdom were at the lowest ebb; constantly engaged in hostilities, he  had not leisure or the means of attending to the welfare of the  Parisians, and the disasters he encountered caused his reign to be  remembered as a series of misfortunes. Several colleges, however, were  founded in his reign; amongst others, that of the College des Ecossais  (Scotch College) then in the Rue des Amandiers, but now existing in the  Rue des Fosses St. Victor. It was first instituted by David, Bishop of  Murray, in Scotland, but the present building was erected by Robert  Barclay in 1662.    The College des Lombards was founded by a number of Italians, and was  some years afterwards deserted, but in 1633 was given by the government  to two Irish priests, and has from that period become an Irish seminary;  and several other colleges, which have either been abandoned or their  locality changed, and often united to other colleges, some of which are  still existing. On the death of Philippe, John, surnamed the Good,  ascended a throne of trouble in 1350, and encountered a succession of  misfortunes of which Paris had its share; from the immense number of  churches, monasteries, colleges, hospitals, and other public edifices,  the wall which surrounded Paris, built by Philippe-Auguste, enclosed too  limited a space to contain the houses of the increased population, which  continued to augment, notwithstanding all the impediments which bad  government could create. A more extended wall therefore became necessary  to protect those inhabitants who resided beyond the limits of the first,  and whose position was likely to be compromised by the position in  which France was placed by the battle of Poitiers, by a band of  ruffians called the Companions, who carried desolation wherever they  appeared, and by what was termed La Jacquerie, hordes of peasants who  were armed and levied contributions upon the peaceable inhabitants as  they traversed the country, in groups too numerous to be withstood by  the tranquil residents. The extension of the wall was erected under the  superintendence of Etienne Marcel, called _Prevot des Marchands_; what  might be termed Mayor or Chief Magistrate of the tradespeople, a man of  extraordinary energy, which he exerted to the utmost for the benefit of  his fellow citizens, and at this period first began the custom of  putting chains at night across the streets as a measure of security, as  notwithstanding that Paris was menaced on all sides by enemies from  without, insurrections of the most violent nature took place within its  walls, commencing on account of the Dauphin, who was governor of Paris  and regent of the kingdom (in consequence of the imprisonment of his  father John in England), issuing a coinage consisting of base metal  which he was compelled to recall; but the fire-brand was kindled, other  grievances were mooted, thirty thousand armed Parisians assembled headed  by Etienne Marcel, who himself stabbed Robert de Clermont, Marshal of  Normandy, and Jean de Conflans, Marshal of Champagne, in the presence of  the Dauphin; but to save the latter from the fury of the people, Marcel  changed hats with the Prince, thus affording him a passport, by causing  him to wear a hat that bore the colours of the people, blue and red.  After a tremendous slaughter, Marcel and his principal friends were  themselves dispatched by the partisans of the Dauphin. During all these  convulsions in the interior of Paris, it was surrounded on one side by  the troops of the King of Navarre, whilst the forces of the Dauphin were  hovering under the walls, the different parties skirmishing with each  other, and all living upon the pillage and contributions levied on the  inhabitants of the adjacent country.    Meantime famine thinned the population of Paris, cut off from any means  of receiving provisions from without; but on account of the wall  constructed by Marcel, Edward III of England found it impossible to make  any progress in the siege, and having exhausted the country for some  leagues of extent, was obliged to retreat for want of food to maintain  his army. The scarcity of money was such in Paris at that period, that  they were compelled to have a circulation of leather coin, with a little  nail of gold or silver stuck in the middle; yet when John returned from  his captivity in England, the streets were hung with carpets wherever he  had to pass, and a cloth of gold borne over his head, the fountains  poured forth wine, and the city made him a present of a silver buffet  weighing a thousand marcs. At this period schools existed in Paris  sanctioned by the government, when the pay for each scholar was so  contemptible that they must have been for the use of the middle  classes, whose means were very confined; they were called _Petites  Ecoles_ (Little Schools), and paid a certain sum for having the  privilege to teach; the number in the reign of John was sixty-three, of  which forty-one were under masters, and twenty-two under mistresses. In  some of the streets of Paris it was the custom to have two large doors  or gates, which were closed at night, and the names of several streets  still bear evidence of that practice, as the _Rue des deux Portes_; the  _Rue des Deux-Portes-Saint-Jean_, _des Deux-Portes-Saint-Sauveur_, etc.    During the reign of John, about 1350, a poem appeared, which contained  advice as to the conduct ladies ought to observe who wished to act with  propriety, and as my fair countrywomen are generally willing to _listen_  to good counsel, no matter how remote the period from which it is  derived, I cannot resist giving them the benefit of some of the  recommendations of the sapient poet to the Parisian belles, some of  which are certainly highly commendable. The verses were written by a  monk, whose name I have forgotten.    \"In walking to church never trot or run, salute those you meet upon the  way, and even return the salutations of the poor; when at church it is  not proper to look either to the right or the left, neither to speak nor  to laugh out loud, but to rise to the Gospel and courteously make the  sign of the cross, to go to the offering without either laughing or  joking, at the moment of the elevation also to rise; then kneel and  pray for all Christians; to recite by heart her prayers, and _if she can  read_, to pray from her psalmody.    \"A courteous lady ought to salute all in going out of church, both great  and small.    \"Those whom nature have endowed with a good voice ought not to refuse to  sing when they are asked.    \"Cleanliness is so necessary for ladies, that it is an obligation for  them to cut their nails.    \"It is not proper for a lady to stop in passing the house of a  neighbour, to look into the interior, because people may be doing things  that they do not wish others to know.    \"When you go and visit a person, never enter abruptly, nor take any one  by surprise, but announce your coming by coughing.    \"At table, a lady should not speak nor laugh too much, and should always  turn the biggest and the best pieces to her guests, and not choose them  for herself.    \"Every time a lady has drank wine she should wipe her mouth with the  table-cloth, but not her eyes or her nose, and she should take care not  to soil and grease her fingers in eating, more than she can possibly  help.\" The reader must remember that forks were not used until the reign  of Henry III. The author also cautions the ladies to be very careful not  to drink to excess, observing that a lady loses talent, wit, beauty, and  every charm, when she is elevated with wine; they are also recommended  not to swear.    He continues: \"Ladies should not veil their faces before nobles; they  may do so when they are on horseback or when they go to church,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17763"],[0,"The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow (#13)"],[1,"ead.\"    \"Why? You had been witness to a deed of blood--a deed which must have  recalled to you the anxiety expressed by the woman whom you regarded  as the young girl's guardian; and yet you shrank back--out of sight--away  from those who had the right to make inquiries! How do you explain that,  Mr. Travis?\"    \"I cannot, except that I was so dazed, so stricken, that I was hardly  conscious of what I did. And, sirs, believe me or not, had it not been  for the refuge afforded by that narrow space behind the pedestal, I think  I should have fallen headlong to the floor. When I came again to myself,  which was after some of the confusion had abated, I had only one thought  in mind: to suppress myself and my story lest some shadow should fall  across her sweet purity. Waiting till the attention of the man you had  placed on guard over her body was attracted another way, I slid out and  hastened to the front, where I managed to find a quiet room in which to  sit down and brood again over my misfortune. Forewarned, as you have  said, and on the spot, with every wish to protect her, I had failed to do  so. I fear it will make me mad some day.\"    Had it made him insane already? Was his story to be trusted? It was full  of incongruities; were they those of a disordered mind? Such had been the  excuse made for Mrs. Taylor when she had been thought guilty of this  attack; why should it not be applied to this man who certainly had given  evidences of not being of the usual type of young Englishman? With a  sidelong look at Mr. Gryce, which that individual perfectly understood,  Dr. Price thanked Mr. Travis for his candor and asked if he could point  out the room in which he had sat while their young man had gone through  the building checking off the position of everybody in it.    To his surprise, the Englishman answered quite simply, \"I will try,\" and  rose when they rose.    The glances exchanged between the other two men were eloquent. Where was  he about to take them? Sweetwater was no fool; how had this man of  marked appearance and generous proportions managed to elude him?    As has happened before, it proved to be easily explainable when once the  conditions were known. The room to which he led them was that on the  upper story marked H on Chart Two. It was devoted, like one or two others  near it, to a line of famous paintings at once the hope and despair of  young girl copyists. The one most favored for this purpose hung just  behind the door \"X,\" which, half-open as they found it, made with the  easel, the canvas upon it and an apron hanging carelessly over all, an  impromptu screen behind which a man crouched in misery on the copyist's  stool might easily remain unnoticed by anyone passing hurriedly by him.    And thus vanished one hindrance to a full belief in young Travis' story.    But a greater one remained. The bow! the bow found behind the tapestry at  the edge of which he had stood in timorous hiding! In the hope that a  shock might startle him into some admission which would give a different  aspect to the case, they now led him back to this place of first  concealment. He was showing strain by this time, and no delay was made to  press their point. Giving the tapestry a pull, the Coroner bade him tell  what he saw behind it.    The answer came with much emotion.    \"The bow! The bow which sped the arrow which killed Miss Willetts. I do  not want to see it. It hurts me--hurts me physically. Let me go, I  entreat.\"    \"Mr. Travis,\" urged the Coroner as they again emerged upon the open  gallery, \"you have said that there was no one with you in the section  where you stood. If that was so, how came this bow to be where you have  just seen it?\"    A bewildered look, a slow shake of the head and nothing more.    \"Did you know it was there? Did you see it thrown there?\"    \"No, I saw nothing. I am an honest man. You may believe me.\"    The Coroner scrutinized him closely but not unkindly.    \"We shall know before night who handled that bow, Mr. Travis. It carries  its own clue with it.\"    A gleam of unmistakable joy lighted up the Englishman's features.    \"I am glad,\" he cried. \"I am glad.\"    Coroner Price was a man of experience. He recognized the ring of truth in  the Englishman's tones, and saying no more, led the way from the gallery.    A few minutes later he was on the lower floor. He had a short  conversation with the two doormen; then he proceeded to the telephone and  called up the Universal.    The result was startling.    Asked if the name of Rupert Henry Travis, Hertfordshire, England, was on  their register, the answer was yes.    \"The date of his arrival?\"    \"Early this morning.\"    \"Any other arrivals to-day from the other side?\"    \"Yes, a Madame Duclos and a Miss Willetts.\"    The Coroner's tone altered. So much of the stranger's story was true,  then.    \"Will you connect me with Madame Duclos. I have important news to give  her. Some woman had better be with her when she receives it.\"    \"I am sorry, but I cannot do this. Madame Duclos has left.\"    \"Left? Gone out, you mean?\"    \"No, left the hotel. She's been gone about half an hour. The young lady  who came with her has gone out too, but we expect her back.\"    \"You do. And what took the older woman away? What excuse did she give,  and where has she gone?\"    \"I cannot tell you where she has gone. She left after receiving a  telephone message from some one in town. Came down to the desk looking  extremely distressed, said that she had had bad news and must go at once.  I made out her bill and, at her request, that of the young lady, whom she  said would be called for by a friend on her return to the hotel. These  bills she paid; after that she left the hotel on foot, carrying her own  bag. The young lady has not returned----\"    \"Enough. The young lady is dead, killed by chance here at the museum. A  plain-clothes man will be with you shortly from Headquarters. Meanwhile  keep your eyes and ears open. If a message comes for either Madame Duclos  or Miss Willetts, notify me here; and if anyone calls, detain the party  at all hazards. That's all; no time to talk.\"    And now Gryce entered the room. He was accompanied by an inspector. This  was a welcome addition to their force. Coroner Price greeted him with  cordiality:    \"You've come in good time, Inspector. The death of this young girl  struck down by an arrow shot by an unknown hand from the opposite side  of the building bids fair to make a greater call on your resources than  on mine. The woman who appears to have acted as companion to Miss  Willetts has fled the hotel where they both took rooms immediately upon  leaving the steamer. Either she has heard of the accident which has  occurred here--and if so, how?--or she's but carrying out some deep-laid  plan which it is highly important for us to know. It looks now like a  premeditated crime.\"    \"With this Englishman involved?\"    \"I doubt that; I seriously doubt that--don't you, Gryce? A more subtle  head than his planned this strange crime.\"    \"Yes; there can be little doubt about that. Shall I set the boys to work,  Inspector? This Frenchwoman must be found.\"    \"At once--a general alarm. You can get a description of her from the  clerk at the Universal. She must not be allowed to leave town.\"    Mr. Gryce sat down before the telephone. Coroner Price proceeded to  acquaint the Inspector with such details of the affair as were now known.  The Curator moved restlessly about. Gloom had settled upon the museum. On  only one face was there a smile to be seen, but that was a heavenly one,  irradiating the countenance of her who had passed from the lesser to the  larger world with the joy of earth still warm in her innocent heart.          BOOK II    MR. X          VIII    ON THE SEARCH      It was late in the afternoon. The Inspector's office had hummed for hours  with messages and reports, and the lull which had finally come seemed  grateful to him. With relaxed brow and a fresh cigar, he sat in quiet  contemplation of the facts brought out by the afternoon's inquiries. He  was on the point of dismissing even these from his mind, when the door  opened and Gryce came in.    Instantly his responsibilities returned upon him in full force. He did  not wait for the expected report, but questioned the detective at once.    \"You have been to the hotel,\" he said, pointing out a chair into which  the old man dropped with a sigh as eloquent of anxiety as of fatigue.  \"What more did you learn there?\"    \"Very little. No message has come; no persons called. For them and for us  these two women, Madame Duclos and Miss Willetts, are still an unknown  quantity. Their baggage, which arrived while I was there, supplied the  only information I was able to obtain.\"    \"Their baggage! But that should tell us everything.\"    \"It may if you think best to go through it. It is not heavy--a trunk for  each, besides the one they brought with them from the steamer. From the  pasters to be seen on them, they have come from the Continental Hotel,  Paris, by way of the Ritz, London. At this latter place their stay was  short. This is proved by the fact that only the steamer-trunk is pasted  with the Ritz label. And this trunk was the one I found in their room at  the Universal. From it Miss Willetts had taken the dress she wore to the  museum. Her other clothes--I mean those she wore on arriving--lay in  disorder on the bed and chairs. I should say that they had been tossed  about by a careless if not hasty hand, while the trunk----\"    \"Well?\"    \"Stood open on the floor.\"    \"Stood open?\"    \"Yes, I went through it, of course.\"    \"And found nothing?\"    \"Nothing to help us to-day. No letters--no cards. Some clothing--some  little trifles (bought in Paris, by the way) and one little book.\"    \"A name in it?\"    \"Yes--_Angeline_; and one line of writing from some poem, I judge. I put  it back where I found it. When we know more, it may help us to"]]]
