This is performed by  stamping both ends of each link at the same time between pairs of  shaping dies or swages.    The ninth operation (illustrated in Fig. 9) is to bring the middle  portion of each link--that is to say, the side members and the cross  stay--to the finished rounded form, which is also performed by means  of a pair of dies or swages.    The tenth and last operation (illustrated in Fig. 10) is to contract  the link slightly in the lateral direction in order to correct any  imperfections at the sides left by the two previous operations and  bring the link to a more perfect and stronger form, as shown. This  operation has the important result of strengthening the link  considerably by contracting or rendering more pointed the arched form  of the bow or end of the link, and also by thickening the metal at  that part where the wear is greatest, this thickening of the metal at  the ends of the link occurring in the direction of the line of strain  (as indicated by _x_ in Fig. 10) and being brought about by the  compression or \"upsetting\" of the metal at the end of the link. It may  be preferable to perform this operation immediately after the seventh  operation, and I reserve the right to do so.    In the case of large cables only the metal is preferably heated for  the eighth, ninth, and tenth operations.    I will now refer to the figures which illustrate the series of tools  whereby the above mentioned operations are performed.    Fig. 1_a_ shows a plan (the punch being in section) and Fig. 1_b_ an  elevation of the bed die of the tool by which the notches _b_ of the  first operation are performed. The feed mechanism is not shown, but  might be of any ordinary intermittent kind. _g_ is a groove in the  bed, in which lies the lower vertical web of the rod, of cruciform  section, the two horizontal webs lying upon the bed with the edge of  the web to be notched lying just over the die, in which works the  punch, B, of which B' is the cutting edge. The punch is operated in  the usual way, its lower end, which does not rise out of the die,  acting as a guide. B* is the beveled stop in the groove, _g_, which by  fitting in the notches, _b_ or _b'_, corrects inaccuracies of the  feed.    Fig. 2_a_ is a sectional plan and Fig. 2_b_ an elevation of the tool  by which the second operation is performed, the same tool being also  used for performing the third operation. (Illustrated in Fig. 3_a_.)  _h h_ are a pair of bed-dies having a space _h'_ between them to  receive the lower web of the bar, and having notches, C C and D D, in  their inner ends, forming counterparts of the punches by which the  pairs of mortises, _c d_, Fig. 2, are punched in the pair of webs  lying upon the bed-dies, _h_. These bed-dies are fitted to slide a  little in opposite directions upon a suitable bed plate and are caused  by the inclined cams, _i'_, on the guides, _i_, of the press head  (which pass through corresponding apertures in the bed-dies, _h_) to  approach each other at the moment the punches come down on the work,  so as to grip the lower web of the rod and support the pair of webs  being operated on close up to the sides of the lower web lying in the  space _h'_, while when the punches rise the bed-dies move apart, so  that the web is quite free in said space _h'_ and the rod may be  easily fed forward for a fresh stroke of the press. B* is the beveled  stop in the space, _k'_, as in the tool first described. The bed-dies  _h_ have a second set of notches C' D' at their outer ends, similar to  but longer than those C D, so that by reversing the bed-dies they will  form counterparts for a second set of punches corresponding thereto  for performing the third operation--_i.e._, enlarging the mortises, _c  d_, as represented in Figs. 3 and 3_a_; or, instead of adapting the  dies, _h_, to perform the two operations, separate tools may be used  for the second and third operations.    Fig. 4_a_ is an elevation and Fig. 4_b_ a sectional plan of the tool  for performing the fourth operation--namely, removing the portion  _a*_, Figs. 3, 3_a_, 4_a_, and 4_b_. This is done by a pair of  punches, A*, corresponding in shape to the ends of the link in the  rough and to the aperture shown in the bed-die, _k_, Fig. 4_b_, which  has a groove, _k'_, to admit the lower web of and to guide the rod.  The beveled stop, B*, used in operating on the pair of webs, a,  corresponds to the notches, _b'_; but in operating on the webs, _a'_,  the stop must be replaced by one corresponding to the aperture left by  the removal of the portion, _a*_.    Fig. 5_a_ is an elevation, Fig. 5_b_ a plan, and Fig. 5_c_ a  longitudinal vertical section of the tool for performing the fifth  operation, the work being shown in section in the latter figure. It  consists of a bed-die, _l_, with groove, _m_, to receive the lower  web, but terminating at a distance from the die apertures, so as to  leave supports, _n_, for the parts, _e*_, of the rod to resist the  downward pressure of the punches, E, which remove the portions, _e_,  from each side of the cross stay, as shown in Figs. 5_b_ and 5_c_. The  correct position of the work in regard to the punches is insured by  these supporting parts, _n_, which terminate the grooves, _m_.    Fig. 6_a_ is an elevation of the winch for performing the sixth  operation.    Fig. 7_a_ is an elevation and Fig. 7_b_ a plan of the tool for  performing the seventh operation. P P are the punches for trimming the  outside and Q Q those for trimming the inside of the ends of the  links. The links adjacent to the one to be operated on are brought  together into the position shown in dotted lines, the bed-die having  an aperture in it to admit of this, so that both ends of the link to  be trimmed may be operated on together.    The tool for performing the eighth operation consists of a pair of  swages, the bottom one only being shown in Fig. 8_a_. The swages  correspond to the intended rounded sectional form of the ends of the  link, which is placed in position between the swages in a similar  manner to that described for Fig. 7_b_, so that both ends are rounded  or finished off at once.    Fig. 9_a_ is a plan of the bottom swage of the tool for performing the  ninth operation, the upper swage corresponding thereto at least in so  far as the middle part of the link to be operated on is concerned.    The tool for performing the tenth operation is represented in  elevation and plan in Figs. 10_a_ and 10_b_. It consists of a pair of  bed-dies, R, fitted to slide together and operated by the cams, s, on  the guide rods, S, the operation being similar to that of the tool  shown in Figs. 2_a_ and 2_b_, except that there are no punches, and  that the link which lies in the cavity of the dies is merely  compressed in the lateral direction by the inward motion of the  bed-dies.    My invention further comprises a modification of the above described  process, which has for its object to enable the weldless stayed links  to be made as short and particularly as narrow as may be necessary in  order to adapt the chain to run over the sheaves of pulley blocks and  to suit other purposes for which short-link welded chain has  heretofore only been available.    [Illustration: Figures 5_a-c_, 8_a_, 9_a_, 10-12                 MANUFACTURE OF WELDLESS CHAINS.]    In the manufacture of chains by the aforesaid process of punching  there is a practical minimum limit for the dimensions of the punches  which cannot be reduced without compromising their efficiency, and  consequently the width (and therefore the length) of the link must  necessarily bear a certain proportion to the thickness of the web of  metal out of which it is formed, since the breadth of the link depends  on the length of the cross stay, which is determined by the breadth of  the mortises forming the eyes of the link. The present modification  enables these dimensions to be reduced without reducing the  dimensions, and consequently the efficiency, of the punches which form  the eyes of the link. The modification applies to what I have  designated the fifth operation of the above described process; and it  consists in punching out the middle of the cross stay (so as to leave  only two short stumps jutting inward from the side members of the  link), this operation serving to interrupt the continuity of the core,  which was the object of the fifth operation. For this purpose I  substitute for the pair of punches illustrated in Figs. 5_a_ and 5_c_  a single punch, which removes that part of the \"core\" of the cruciform  bar which is situated at the middle of the strut. This tool is  represented in Fig. 11, and the effect of its operation is shown in  Fig. 12. The subsequent operations, herein designated the sixth,  seventh, eighth, and ninth operations, are performed as hereinbefore  described; but the tenth operation has the effect of closing together  the two stumps, _g g_, until they abut together at the middle of the  link and together constitute a cross strut or stay, which prevents any  further lateral collapse of the link. In the operation of closing up  the gap between the stumps, _g g_, the link is brought to the narrow  form shown in Fig. 12, the eyes of the links being only just wide  enough to receive the end of the adjacent link enchained therewith  without gripping it. This operation is performed by a tool similar to  that shown in Figs. 10_a_ and 10_b_, above referred to.           *       *       *       *       *          AN ENGLISH STEAM FIRE ENGINE.

Henry's instructions to his Secretary  or Ambassador at Rome he pronounces \"very rough matter to set upon  the table uncooked,\" and recommends an Appendix, unluckily without  avail. \"Abridge, redact,\" he exclaims towards the end, but there was  no abridgment and no redaction. On the other hand, \"prestige,\"  stigmatised by Carlyle as \"a bad newspaper word,\" was rejected for  \"influence,\" and his insistence that English only should be used in  the text, foreign languages being confined to notes, was accepted by  Froude. That \"new doctrines ever gain readiest hearing among the  common people\" he left to stand as a general proposition, although,  as Carlyle reminded him, \"in Germany it was by no means the common  people who believed Luther first, but the Elector of Saxony, Philip  of Hesse, etc., etc.--Scotland too.\"    The conclusion at which Carlyle arrived after reading the second  chapter is less favourable than his verdict upon the first.  Inasmuch, however, as some of the modifications suggested were made,  though by no means all of them, and as Carlyle's notions of history  are worth knowing on their own account, I will transcribe his words,  which are dated the 27th of September, 1855:    \"This chapter contains a great deal of well meditated knowledge,  just insight, and sound thinking; seems calculated to explain the  Phaenomenon of the Reformation to an unusual degree, in fact has  great merit of many kinds, historical among the rest. But it seems  to me (1) to be more of a Dissertation than a Narrative; to want  dates, specific details, outline of every kind. (2) The management  might surely be mended? It does not \"begin at the beginning\" (which  indeed is the most difficult of all things, but also the most  indispensable); the story is not clear; or rather, as hinted above,  there is no story, but an explanation of some story supposed to be  already known, which is contrary to rule in writing 'History.' On  the whole, the Author seems to have such a conception of the subject  as were well worth a better setting forth; and if this is all he has  yet written of his Book, I could almost advise him to start afresh,  and remodel all this second chapter. This is a high demand; but the  excellence attainable by him seems also high. The rule throughout  is, that events should speak. Commentary ought to be sparing; clear  insight, definite conviction, brought about with a minimum of  Commentary; that is always the Art of History. Alter or not,  however, there is such a generous breadth of intelligence, of manly  sympathy, sound judgment, and in general of luminous solidity,  promised in this Book, that I will gladly read it, however it be put  together. Would it not be better to specify a little what Martin  Luther is about, and keep up a chronological intercourse, more or  less strict, with the great Continental ocean of Reform, the better  to understand the tides from it that ebb and flow in these Narrow  Seas? Some notice of Wiclif too I expected in some form or other.  Once more, Go on and prosper!\"    The notice of Wycliffe does seem a rather unreasonable expectation,  and a history of England loses identity if it becomes a history of  Europe. But Carlyle's principles, whether he always acted upon them  himself or no, are excellent, and, though Froude's second chapter  was not quite rewritten, the effect of them may be seen in the rest  of the book.    Carlyle's influence upon Froude, which happily never extended to his  style, confirmed him in his attachment to Protestantism and his  hatred of Rome. It also accounted for much of Froude's belief in  despots. In democracy he had no faith. Manhood suffrage in England,  would, he thought, even in the wonderful year 1588, the last of his  History, have restored the Pope. This was perhaps a little  inconsistent with his theory that Henry VIII. had been popular with  all classes. Yet at least Froude could distinguish one despot from  another. He was entirely opposed, as we have seen, to the alliance  with Louis Napoleon against Russia, which culminated in the Crimean  War. Otherwise his sympathy with Liberalism was chiefly academic. He  rejoiced in the University Commission, and in the consequent removal  of religious tests for undergraduates. But he took Carlyle's Latter-  Day Pamphlets for gospel, and had no faith in peace by great  Exhibitions, or progress by political reform. The war with Russia  justified the first part of his creed, and even Liberals in the  House of Commons seemed tacitly to agree with the second. To the  glorification of mere money-making, the worship of the golden calf,  the sincerest and the most fashionable of all worships, both he and  Carlyle were equally opposed. They were agreed with the Socialists  and with Ruskin in their dislike of seeing bricks and mortar  substituted for green fields, smoky chimneys for church towers,  myriads of factory hands for the rural population of England.  Carlyle still called himself a Radical, a believer in root and  branch change, but moral rather than political. His faith in  representative institutions had been shaken by reflecting that the  Long Parliament, the best ever assembled in England, would have  given up the cause of the Civil War if it had not been for Cromwell  and the army. Although he had been one of Peel's warmest supporters  in 1846, he had come to dread Liberalism as tending towards anarchy,  and he adopted the singular verbal fallacy that a low franchise  would mean a low standard of politics. Froude, though he still  called himself a Liberal, and in some respects always was so, swore  by Carlyle, acknowledged him as his master, and repeated his creed.  Carlyle had many admirers, but few disciples, and he naturally set  great value on Froude's adhesion. He had always a great contempt for  universal suffrage. It would have given, he said grimly, the same  voice in the government of Palestine to Jesus Christ and to Judas  Iscariot. But whatever might have happened to Judas, the Son of man  had not where to lay His head, and would certainly have been  excluded under any system which met the approval of Carlyle. In  Latter-Day Pamphlets Carlyle had made a tremendous attack upon  Downing Street, and the administrative deficiencies which the  Crimean campaign disclosed could be treated as confirmatory evidence  in his favour. As a matter of fact, Lord Aberdeen and Lord  Palmerston were all the same to him. He was denouncing the  Parliamentary system, which has borne up against worse Ministers  than the Duke of Newcastle. If Sebastopol had been taken after the  Alma, as it well might have been, Carlyle would not have altered his  tone. Nothing would have prevented him from delivering his message,  or Froude from accepting it.    The first two volumes of the History appeared in 1856. They dealt  with the latter part of Henry's reign, when he had rid himself of  Wolsey, and was personally ruling England with the aid of Thomas  Cromwell. Froude had to describe the dissolution of the monasteries,  and besides describing he justified it. He had to depict the  absolute government of Henry; and he argued that it was a necessity  of the times. We must not transfer the passions of one age to the  controversies of another. In the seventeenth century the issue was  between the Stuart kings and their Parliaments, or, in other words,  between the Crown and the people. In the sixteenth century king and  Parliament were united against an alien power, the Catholic Church,  and a foreign prince, the Pope. Before England was free she had to  become Protestant, and Henry, whatever his motives, was on the  Protestant side. That he was himself an unscrupulous tyrant is  beside the point. He was an ephemeral phaemomenon, and, as a matter  of fact, his tyranny, which the people never felt, died with him.  The Church of Rome was a permanent fact, immortal, if not  unchangeable, which would have reduced England, if it had prevailed,  to the condition of France, Italy, and Spain. Whether Henry VIII.  was a good man, or a bad one, is not the question. Bishop Stubbs,  who cannot be accused of anti-ecclesiastical, or anti-theological  prejudice, calls him a \"grand, gross figure,\" not to be tried and  condemned by ordinary standards of private morals. The only interest  of his character now is its bearing upon the fate of England. If the  Pope, and not the king, had become head of the English Church, would  it have been for the advantage of the English people? By frankly  taking the king's side Froude made two different and influential  sets of enemies, especially at Oxford. High Churchmen, then and for  the rest of his life, assailed him for hostility to \"the Church,\"  forgetting or ignoring the fact that the Church of England is not  the Church of Rome. Liberals, on the other hand, mistook him for a  friend of lawless despotism, as if Henry's opponents had been  constitutional statesmen, and not arrogant Churchmen, hating liberty  even more than he did.    That Froude had no faith in modern Liberalism is true enough. His  political leader in 1856 was neither Palmerston nor Cobden, but  Carlyle. In 1529 he would have been a King's man and not a Pope's  man, an Englishman first and a Churchman afterwards. Lord Melbourne  used to declare, in his paradoxical manner, that Henry VIII. was the  greatest man who ever lived, because he always had his own way.    Strength is not greatness, and Melbourne must not be taken  literally. What can be pleaded for Henry, without paradox and with  truth, is that he imposed upon Catholic and Protestant alike the  supremacy of the law. Froude preached the subordination of the  Church to the State; and while supporters of the voluntary principle  regarded him with suspicion,"]]]
