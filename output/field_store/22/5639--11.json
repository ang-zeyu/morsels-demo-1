D'you tell him to?\"    Bud came out of a homesick revery and looked at him inquiringly. \"No, I  didn't tell him anything.\"    \"I believe that, all right,\" Dirk retorted. \"You don't go around tellin'  all yuh know. I like that in a feller. A man never got into trouble  yet by keepin' his mouth shut; but there's plenty that have talked  themselves into the pen. Me, I've got no use for a talker.\"    Bud sent him a sidelong glance of inquiry, and Dirk caught him at it and  grinned.    \"Yuh been here a month, and you ain't said a damn word about where you  come from or anything further back than throwin' and tyin' that critter.  You said cow-country, and that has had to do some folks that might be  curious. Well, she's a tearin' big place--cow-country. She runs from  Canady to Mexico, and from the corn belt to the Pacific Ocean, mighty  near takes in Jackson's Hole, and a lot uh country I know.\" He parted  his mustache and spat carefully into the sand. \"I'm willin' to tie to a  man, specially a young feller, that can play the game the way you been  playin' it, Bud. Most always,\" he complained vaguely, \"they carry  their brand too damn main. They either pull their hats down past their  eyebrows and give everybody the bad eye, or else they're too damn ready  to lie about themselves. You throw in with the boys just fine--but you  ain't told a one of 'em where you come from, ner why, ner nothin'.\"    \"I'm here because I'm here,\" Bud chanted softly, his eyes stubborn even  while he smiled at Dirk.    \"I know--yuh sung that the first night yuh come, and yuh looked straight  at the boss all the while you was singin' it,\" Dirk interrupted, and  laughed slyly. \"The boys, they took that all in, too. And Bart, he  wasn't asleep, neither. You sure are smooth as they make 'em, Bud. I  guess,\" he leaned closer to predict confidentially, \"you've just about  passed the probation time, young feller. If I know the signs, the boss  is gittin' ready to raise yuh.\"    He looked at Bud rather sharply. Instantly the training of Buddy rose  within Bud. His memory flashed back unerringly to the day when he had  watched that Indian gallop toward the river, and had sneered because the  Indian evidently expected him to follow into the undergrowth.    Dirk Tracy did not in the least resemble an Indian, nor did his rambling  flattery bear any likeness to a fleeing enemy; yet it was plain enough  that he was trying in a bungling way to force Bud's confidence, and for  that reason Bud stared straight ahead and said nothing.    He did not remember having sung that particular ditty during his first  evening at the Muleshoe, nor of staring at the boss while he sung. He  might have done both, he reflected; he had sung one song after another  for about four hours that night, and unless he sang with his eyes shut  he would have to look somewhere. That it should be taken by the  whole outfit as a broad hint to ask no questions seemed to him rather  farfetched.    Nor did he see why Dirk should compliment him on keeping his mouth  shut, or call him smooth. He did not know that he had been on probation,  except perhaps as that applied to his ability as a cow-hand. And he  could see no valid reason why the boss should contemplate \"raising\" him.  So far, he had been doing no more than the rest of the boys, except  when there was roping to be done and he and Stopper were called upon  to distinguish themselves by fast rope-work, with never a miss. Sixty  dollars a month was as good pay as he had any right to expect.    Dirk, he decided, had given him one good tip which he would follow at  once. Dirk had said that no man ever got into trouble by keeping his  mouth shut. Bud closed his for a good half hour, and when he opened it  again he undid all the good he had accomplished by his silence.    \"Where does that trail go, that climbs up over the mountains back of  that peak?\" he asked. \"Seems to be a stock trail. Have you got grazing  land beyond the mountains?\"    Dirk took time to pry off a fresh chew of tobacco before he replied.  \"You mean Thunder Pass? That there crosses over into the Black Rim  country. Yeah--There's a big wide range country over there, but we don't  run any stock on it. Burroback Valley's big enough for the Muleshoe.\"    Bud rolled a cigarette. \"I didn't mean that main trail; that's a wagon  road, and Thunder Pass cuts through between Sheepeater peak and this one  ahead of us--Gospel, you call it. What I referred to is that blind trail  that takes off up the canyon behind the corrals, and crosses into the  mountains the other side of Gospel.\"    Dirk eyed him. \"I dunno 's I could say, right offhand, what trail yuh  mean,\" he parried. \"Every canyon 's got a trail that runs up a ways, and  there's canyons all through the mountains; they all lead up to water, or  feed, or something like that, and then quit, most gen'rally; jest peter  out, like.\" And he added with heavy sarcasm, \"A feller that's lived  on the range oughta know what trails is for, and how they're made.  Cowcritters are curious-same as humans.\"    To this Bud did not reply. He was smoking and staring at the brushy  lower slopes of the mountain ridge before them. He had explained quite  fully which trail he meant. It was, as he had said, a \"blind\" trail;  that is, the trail lost itself in the creek which watered a string of  corrals. Moreover, Bud had very keen eyes, and he had seen how a panel  of the corral directly across the shale-rock bed of a small stream was  really a set of bars. The round pole corral lent itself easily to hidden  gateways, without any deliberate attempt at disguising their presence.    The string of four corrals running from this upper one--which,  he remembered, was not seen from nearer the stables-was perhaps a  convenient arrangement in the handling of stock, although it was  unusual. The upper corral had been built to fit snugly into a rocky  recess in the base of the peak called Gospel. It was larger than some  of the others, since it followed the contour of the basin-like recess.  Access to it was had from the fourth corral (which from the ranch  appeared to be the last) and from the creekbed that filled the narrow  mouth of the canyon behind.    Dirk might not have understood him, Bud thought. He certainly should  have recognized at once the trail Bud meant, for there was no other  canyon back of the corrals, and even that one was not apparent to one  looking at the face of the steep slope. Stock had been over that canyon  trail within the last month or so, however; and Bud's inference that the  Muleshoe must have grazing ground across the mountains was natural; the  obvious explanation of its existence.    \"How 'd you come to be explorin' around Gospel, anyway?\" Dirk quizzed  finally. \"A person'd think, short-handed as the Muleshoe is this spring,  't you'd git all the ridin' yuh want without prognosticatin' around  aimless.\"    Now Bud was not a suspicious young man, and he had been no more than  mildly inquisitive about that trail. But neither was he a fool; he  caught the emphasis which Dirk had placed on the word aimless, and his  thoughts paused and took another look at Dirk's whole conversation.  There was something queer about it, something which made Bud sheer off  from his usual unthinking assurance that things were just what they  seemed.    Immediately, however, he laughed--at himself as well as at Dirk.    \"We've been feeding on sour bread and warmed-over coffee ever since the  cook disappeared and Bart put Hen in the kitchen,\" he said. \"If I were  you, Dirk, I wouldn't blister my hands shovelling that grub into myself  for a while. You're bilious, old-timer. No man on earth would talk the  way you've been talking to-day unless his whole digestive apparatus were  out of order.\"    Dirk spat angrily at a dead sage bush. \"They shore as hell wouldn't talk  the kinda talk you've been talkie' unless they was a born fool or else  huntin' trouble,\" he retorted venomously.    \"The doctor said I'd be that way if I lived,\" Bud grinned, amiably,  although his face had flushed at Dirk's tone. \"He said it wouldn't hurt  me for work.\"    \"Yeah--and what kinda work?\" Dirk rode so close that his horse  shouldered Bud's leg discomfortingly. \"I been edgin' yuh along to see  what-f'r brand yuh carried. And I've got ye now, you damned snoopin'  kioty. Bart, he hired yuh to work-and not to go prowling around lookin'  up trails that ain't there--\"    \"You're a dim-brand reader, I don't think! Why you--!\"    Oh, well--remember that Bud was only Buddy grown bigger, and he had  never lacked the spirit to look out for himself. Remember, too, that  he must have acquired something of a vocabulary, in the course  of twenty-one years of absorbing everything that came within his  experience.    Dirk reached for his gun, but Bud was expecting that. Dirk was not quite  quick enough, and his hand therefore came forward with a jerk when he  saw that he was \"covered.\" Bud leaned, pulled Dirk's six-shooter from  its holster and sent it spinning into a clump of bushes. He snatched a  wicked-looking knife from Dirk's boot where he had once seen Dirk slip  it sheathed when he dressed in the bunk-house, and sent that after the  gun.    \"Now, you long-eared walrus, you're in a position to play fair. What are  you going to do about it?\" He reined away, out of Dirk's reach, took his  handkerchief and wrapped his own gun tightly to protect it from sand,  and threw it after Dirk's gun and the knife. \"Am I a snooping coyote?\"  he demanded watching Dirk.    \"You air. More 'n all that, you're a damned spy! And I kin lick yuh an'  lass' yuh an' lead yuh to Bart like a sheep!\"    They dismounted, left their horses to stand with reins dropped, threw  off their coats and fought until they were too tired to land another  blow. There were no fatalities.

De Bible says ve have a Fader in heaven, and I believe it. I also  believe ve have 'a moder der,' as de song says.

The whole thing charmed him, both the speaker and that which  was spoken. A new light seemed to dawn upon him. What if this life was  but a school, anyway, into which eternal souls were being sent to be  proved, to be taught.    \"Have you any other quotations on the subject?    \"Oh, yes; it is full,\" said she. \"When you get time read Heb. 12:9,  Jer. 1:4-5, Eph. 1:3-5 and John 9:1-3. I do not remember more now.\"    Rupert took them down, and read them that night before he went to bed.  And each day he saw a new horizon; and the sweet-faced Norwegian was not  the least factor in this continued change of mental vision. \"God bless  her,\" he said to himself, \"God has sent her to me for a purpose;\" and he  began to add to his prayers that he might so live that he would be  worthy of the blessings which, seemingly, were coming his way.          IX.        \"Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being    alone\"--_James 2:17._    Chamogo Valley lies on the edge of the great arid region of America. At  the time of Rupert Ames' arrival in the valley, full crops were never  certain, and during some years, rain was so scarce that there were no  crops at all. The Chicago real estate dealer who had sold Mr. Janson his  land had not enlightened him on this fact, and so he had already lost  the best part of two years' work by failure of crops. Rupert Ames  learned of all this from Mr. Janson, and then he wondered why advantage  was not taken of the stream in the bottom of the valley for irrigation  purposes.    One day--it was near the end of the harvest, and they were pitting their  last potatoes--Rupert asked Mr. Janson if the adjoining lands could be  bought.    \"Why, yes,\" was the reply. \"I was offered nearly the whole valley for a  small sum, but I have all the land I care to handle. You see, this  region would be different if we could rely on the moisture, but we  can't, and I am nearly tired of it myself. Do you want to buy me out?\"  This with a laugh.    \"Can you raise money enough to buy this whole valley?\" asked Rupert  seriously.    \"Yes; I could get it.\"    \"Then I am going to propose something to you.\"    Whereupon Rupert pointed out that the rich bench lands on each side of  the river could be brought under cultivation, and crops secured every  year by bringing the water from the stream in canals, and watering, or  irrigating them. Mr. Janson listened with wonder at Rupert's description  of Dry-bench reservoir, and how simple it would be to construct canals  by which to water Chamogo valley.    \"This valley can be made to support a good-sized population,\" said  Rupert. \"By securing the land and digging canals to it, and then  selling it out in farms again--well, if you don't make a hundred per  cent on your investment, I am mistaken.\"    They had many talks on the scheme, and at last it was decided to try it.  Rupert would supervise the construction of the canals. He would remain  during the winter, do what work could be done before the snow came, and  then continue the work in the spring.    The land was secured at a small outlay. The canal was surveyed and a  little digging was done that fall. When the snow came, Rupert rode  twenty-one miles to the county seat, took the teachers' examination,  received a certificate, and obtained the Chamogo district school for the  winter. It was a new experience for him, and a trying one at first. The  big boys came to school to get out of the storm, and incidentally, to  learn something of the three R's. They were often wild, but Rupert  managed them without doing any \"licking,\" the usual mode of discipline.  He now wrote to his sister Nina, and told her that he was located for  the winter; that he expected to get back to Willowby, but not for a  time.    So the winter months passed. Rupert studied his own lessons when he was  not preparing for his day's work. He made frequent visits to the  Jansons, though it was a good three miles' drive. He was always received  as a friend, and, indeed, was treated as one of the family.    Was it strange that a tie should grow between Rupert Ames and Signe  Dahl? Was it anything out of the way that Rupert's trips became more  frequent, and that the fair-haired Norwegian looked longingly down the  road for the school-master's horse?    Rupert did not try to deceive himself. It had been a year only since his  experience with Virginia Wilton. He had thought that he never would get  over that, but even now he could look back on it with indifference, yes,  even with thankfulness. This love which seemed to be coming to him was  different from that first experience. He could not explain this  difference, but he knew that it existed. Rupert had no misgivings. Signe  did not thrill him, did not hold him spell-bound with her presence. No;  it was only a calm, sweet assurance that she was a good girl, that he  loved her, and that she thought well of him. Their conversations were  mostly on serious, but deeply interesting subjects. Signe, in common  with her cousin and Mr. Janson, had religious views of her own, which  were peculiar, at least to Rupert. Nothing more than the common  doctrines of the Christian denominations had Rupert ever heard. Signe  knew her Bible well, and she could find wonderful things within its  lids, teachings which were new to Rupert, but which opened to him a  future, a bright, glorious future, full of possibilities. Besides, they  explained to him many of the mysteries of life and answered many of its  hard questions.    Thus one evening--it was Friday, and he lingered longer on that  evening--Mr. and Mrs. Janson were visiting neighbors, and Rupert and  Signe were alone. They sat by the kitchen stove, and the blazing pine  wood made a lamp unnecessary. Signe had received a letter from home  which she had translated to Rupert. Her father had long since forgiven  her. The few dollars she sent home now and then multiplied to quite a  few _kroner_ by the time they reached Norway, and they helped the  struggling family. After old country topics had been exhausted, the  conversation had drifted to religious themes, and especially to the  doctrine expressed in the song \"O my Father;\" but they now sat silently  looking into the fire. Their chairs were not far apart, and it was an  easy matter for Rupert to lay his hand over Signe's fingers that rested  on the arm of her chair and draw them closely into his big palm.    \"Signe,\" he said, \"if we ever lived as intelligent beings in a  pre-existent state--and I now can not doubt it,--we two knew each other  there. Perhaps we were the closest friends, and I have just been letting  my imagination run wild in contemplating the possibilities.\"    \"Let me tell you someting--thing. Did I get tha-at right?\"    \"You get the th as well as I, and the w's trouble you no more.\"    \"Only sometimes I forget, I was going to say, you remember the first  night you came here?\"    \"I certainly do;\" and he pressed her fingers a little closer.    \"Well, I seemed to know you from the first. Though you looked bad and  like a tramp, I knew you were not, and I felt as if I had known you  before.\"    They were silent again, \"reading life's meaning in each other's eyes.\"    Signe filled the stove from the box beside it.    \"You remember that book you gave me to read the other day, Signe?\"    \"Yes; what do you think of it?\"    \"I have been thinking considerably about it. It sets forth gospel  doctrine altogether different from what I have ever heard; still it  agrees perfectly with what Christ and His disciples taught. You know, I  have always been taught that man is a kind of passive being, as regards  the salvation of his soul; that everything has been done for him; that,  in fact, it would be the basest presumption on his part to attempt to do  anything for himself; that man is without free agency in the matter;  that he is simply as a lump of clay, and with little more intelligence  or active powers.\"    \"I know all about such teachings,\" said Signe, as she went for her  Bible. \"They were drilled into me in the old country.\"    \"Now,\" continued he, \"I see that such doctrines lower man, who is, in  fact, a child of God. I cannot perceive that an Allwise Parent would  thus take away the agency of His children. We have a motto in school  which says: 'Self effort educates,' and I believe that to be the only  principle upon which we can safely grow, if we are to become like unto  our Eternal Father.\"    \"Yes,\" answered Signe, \"but you must remember one thing, that 'as in  Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.' The  resurrection from the dead comes through Christ without any effort on  our part. We were not responsible for Adam's transgression, therefore we  are redeemed from its effects through the atonement of Christ, all  mankind are, both good and bad--all will arise and stand before God to  be judged by the deeds done in the body.\"    \"Yes; I admit all that; but it is hardly plain to me what we must do to  be freed from our individual sins. We are in the midst of sin. We are in  a mortal state and partake of our surroundings. Now, there must be a  plan by which we may be rid of these imperfections, for if we are ever  to live in the presence of God, it seems to me that we must be pure and  holy, without sin.\"    Signe had her book open. \"I will read here an answer to your question,\"  she said. \"You remember"]]]
