Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#13)"],[1,", and think of younger ladies, if you can  find any worthy of you.\"    And so the son went forth, and the mother returned to her prayers.    He walked down to the pebble ridge, where the surges of the bay have  defeated their own fury, by rolling up in the course of ages a rampart  of gray boulder-stones, some two miles long, as cunningly curved, and  smoothed, and fitted, as if the work had been done by human hands, which  protects from the high tides of spring and autumn a fertile sheet of  smooth, alluvial turf. Sniffing the keen salt air like a young sea-dog,  he stripped and plunged into the breakers, and dived, and rolled, and  tossed about the foam with stalwart arms, till he heard himself hailed  from off the shore, and looking up, saw standing on the top of the  rampart the tall figure of his cousin Eustace.    Amyas was half-disappointed at his coming; for, love-lorn rascal, he had  been dreaming all the way thither of Rose Salterne, and had no wish  for a companion who would prevent his dreaming of her all the way back.  Nevertheless, not having seen Eustace for three years, it was but civil  to scramble out and dress, while his cousin walked up and down upon the  turf inside.    Eustace Leigh was the son of a younger brother of Leigh of Burrough, who  had more or less cut himself off from his family, and indeed from his  countrymen, by remaining a Papist. True, though born a Papist, he had  not always been one; for, like many of the gentry, he had become a  Protestant under Edward the Sixth, and then a Papist again under Mary.  But, to his honor be it said, at that point he had stopped, having  too much honesty to turn Protestant a second time, as hundreds did, at  Elizabeth's accession. So a Papist he remained, living out of the way  of the world in a great, rambling, dark house, still called \"Chapel,\"  on the Atlantic cliffs, in Moorwinstow parish, not far from Sir Richard  Grenville's house of Stow. The penal laws never troubled him; for, in  the first place, they never troubled any one who did not make conspiracy  and rebellion an integral doctrine of his religious creed; and next,  they seldom troubled even them, unless, fired with the glory of  martyrdom, they bullied the long-suffering of Elizabeth and her council  into giving them their deserts, and, like poor Father Southwell in  after years, insisted on being hanged, whether Burleigh liked or not.  Moreover, in such a no-man's-land and end-of-all-the-earth was that old  house at Moorwinstow, that a dozen conspiracies might have been hatched  there without any one hearing of it; and Jesuits and seminary priests  skulked in and out all the year round, unquestioned though unblest; and  found a sort of piquant pleasure, like naughty boys who have crept  into the store-closet, in living in mysterious little dens in a lonely  turret, and going up through a trap-door to celebrate mass in a secret  chamber in the roof, where they were allowed by the powers that were to  play as much as they chose at persecuted saints, and preach about hiding  in dens and caves of the earth. For once, when the zealous parson  of Moorwinstow, having discovered (what everybody knew already) the  existence of \"mass priests and their idolatry\" at Chapel House, made  formal complaint thereof to Sir Richard, and called on him, as the  nearest justice of the peace, to put in force the act of the fourteenth  of Elizabeth, that worthy knight only rated him soundly for a  fantastical Puritan, and bade him mind his own business, if he wished  not to make the place too hot for him; whereon (for the temporal  authorities, happily for the peace of England, kept in those days  a somewhat tight hand upon the spiritual ones) the worthy parson  subsided,--for, after all, Mr. Thomas Leigh paid his tithes regularly  enough,--and was content, as he expressed it, to bow his head in the  house of Rimmon like Naaman of old, by eating Mr. Leigh's dinners  as often as he was invited, and ignoring the vocation of old Father  Francis, who sat opposite to him, dressed as a layman, and calling  himself the young gentleman's pedagogue.    But the said birds of ill-omen had a very considerable lien on the  conscience of poor Mr. Thomas Leigh, the father of Eustace, in the form  of certain lands once belonging to the Abbey of Hartland. He more than  half believed that he should be lost for holding those lands; but he did  not believe it wholly, and, therefore, he did not give them up; which  was the case, as poor Mary Tudor found to her sorrow, with most of her  \"Catholic\" subjects, whose consciences, while they compelled them to  return to the only safe fold of Mother Church (extra quam nulla salus),  by no means compelled them to disgorge the wealth of which they had  plundered that only hope of their salvation. Most of them, however, like  poor Tom Leigh, felt the abbey rents burn in their purses; and, as John  Bull generally does in a difficulty, compromised the matter by a second  folly (as if two wrong things made one right one), and petted foreign  priests, and listened, or pretended not to listen, to their plottings  and their practisings; and gave up a son here, and a son there, as a  sort of a sin-offering and scapegoat, to be carried off to Douay, or  Rheims, or Rome, and trained as a seminary priest; in plain English, to  be taught the science of villainy, on the motive of superstition. One of  such hapless scapegoats, and children who had been cast into the fire to  Moloch, was Eustace Leigh, whom his father had sent, giving the fruit of  his body for the sin of his soul, to be made a liar of at Rheims.    And a very fair liar he had become. Not that the lad was a bad fellow at  heart; but he had been chosen by the harpies at home, on account of his  \"peculiar vocation;\" in plain English, because the wily priests had seen  in him certain capacities of vague hysterical fear of the unseen (the  religious sentiment, we call it now-a-days), and with them that tendency  to be a rogue, which superstitious men always have. He was now a tall,  handsome, light-complexioned man, with a huge upright forehead, a very  small mouth, and a dry and set expression of face, which was always  trying to get free, or rather to seem free, and indulge in smiles and  dimples which were proper; for one ought to have Christian love, and  if one had love one ought to be cheerful, and when people were cheerful  they smiled; and therefore he would smile, and tried to do so; but his  charity prepense looked no more alluring than malice prepense would have  done; and, had he not been really a handsome fellow, many a woman who  raved about his sweetness would have likened his frankness to that of a  skeleton dancing in fetters, and his smiles to the grins thereof.    He had returned to England about a month before, in obedience to the  proclamation which had been set forth for that purpose (and certainly  not before it was needed), that, \"whosoever had children, wards,  etc., in the parts beyond the seas, should send in their names to the  ordinary, and within four months call them home again.\" So Eustace was  now staying with his father at Chapel, having, nevertheless, his private  matters to transact on behalf of the virtuous society by whom he  had been brought up; one of which private matters had brought him to  Bideford the night before.    So he sat down beside Amyas on the pebbles, and looked at him all over  out of the corners of his eyes very gently, as if he did not wish to  hurt him, or even the flies on his back; and Amyas faced right round,  and looked him full in the face with the heartiest of smiles, and held  out a lion's paw, which Eustace took rapturously, and a great shaking of  hands ensued; Amyas gripping with a great round fist, and a quiet quiver  thereof, as much as to say, \"I AM glad to see you;\" and Eustace pinching  hard with white, straight fingers, and sawing the air violently up and  down, as much as to say, \"DON'T YOU SEE how glad I am to see you?\" A  very different greeting from the former.    \"Hold hard, old lad,\" said Amyas, \"before you break my elbow. And where  do you come from?\"    \"From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in  it,\" said he, with a little smile and nod of mysterious self-importance.    \"Like the devil, eh? Well, every man has his pattern. How is my uncle?\"    Now, if there was one man on earth above another, of whom Eustace Leigh  stood in dread, it was his cousin Amyas. In the first place, he knew  Amyas could have killed him with a blow; and there are natures, who,  instead of rejoicing in the strength of men of greater prowess than  themselves, look at such with irritation, dread, at last, spite;  expecting, perhaps, that the stronger will do to them what they feel  they might have done in his place. Every one, perhaps, has the same  envious, cowardly devil haunting about his heart; but the brave men,  though they be very sparrows, kick him out; the cowards keep him, and  foster him; and so did poor Eustace Leigh.    Next, he could not help feeling that Amyas despised him. They had not  met for three years; but before Amyas went, Eustace never could argue  with him, simply because Amyas treated him as beneath argument. No doubt  he was often rude and unfair enough; but the whole mass of questions  concerning the unseen world, which the priests had stimulated in his  cousin's mind into an unhealthy fungus crop, were to Amyas simply, as he  expressed it, \"wind and moonshine;\" and he treated his cousin as a  sort of harmless lunatic, and, as they say in Devon, \"half-baked.\" And  Eustace knew it; and knew, too, that his cousin did him an injustice.  \"He used to undervalue me,\" said he to himself; \"let us see whether he  does not find me a match for him now.\" And then went off into an agony  of secret contrition for his self-seeking and his forgetting that  \"the glory of God, and not his own exaltation,\" was the object of his  existence.   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18613"],[0,"The Golden Scorpion (#13)"],[1,"\"From what subscriber did that call come?\" I demanded.    Alas! another check awaited me. It had originated in a public call  office, and \"Scorpion\" was untraceable by this means!    Despair is not permitted by the traditions of the Service de Surete.  Therefore I returned to my flat and recorded the facts of the matter  thus far established. I perceived that I had to deal, not with a  designing woman, but with some shadowy being of whom she was an  instrument. The anomaly of her life was in a measure explained. She  sojourned in Paris for a purpose--a mysterious purpose which was  concerned (I could not doubt it) with the Grand Duke Ivan. This was  not an amorous but a political intrigue.    I communicated, at a late hour, with the senior of the three men  watching the Grand Duke. The Grand Duke that evening had sent a  handsome piece of jewellery purchased in Rue de la Paix to the dancer.  It had been returned.    In the morning I met with the good Casimir at his favorite cafe. He  had just discovered that Zara el-Khala drove daily to the Bois de  Boulogne, alone, and that afternoon the Grand Duke had determined to  accost her during her solitary walk. I prepared myself for this event.  Arrayed in a workman's blouse and having a modest luncheon and a small  bottle of wine in a basket, I concealed myself in that part of the  Bois which was the favourite recreation ground of the dancer, and  awaited her appearance.    The Grand Duke appeared first upon the scene, accompanied by Casimir.  The latter pointed out to him a path through the trees along which  Zara el-Khala habitually strolled and showed him the point at which  she usually rejoined the Hindu who followed along the road with the  car. They retired. I seated myself beneath a tree from whence I could  watch the path and the road and began to partake of the repast which  I had brought with me.    At about three o'clock the dancer's car appeared, and the girl,  veiled as usual, stepped out, and having exchanged a few words with  the Indian, began to walk slowly towards me, sometimes pausing to  watch a bird in the boughs above her and sometimes to examine some  wild plant growing beside the way. I ate cheese from the point of a  clasp-knife and drank wine out of the bottle.    Suddenly she saw me.    She had cast her veil aside in order to enjoy the cool and fragrant  air, and as she stopped and regarded me doubtfully where I sat, I saw  her beautiful face, undefiled, now, by make-up and unspoiled by the  presence of garish Eastern ornaments. _Nom d'un nom!_ but she was truly  a lovely woman! My heart went out in sympathy to the poor Grand Duke.  Had I received such a mark of favour from her as he had received, and  had I then been scorned as now she scorned him, I should have been  desperate indeed.    Coming around a bend in the path, then, she stood only a few paces  away, looking at me. I touched the peak of my cap.    \"Good-day, mademoiselle,\" I said. \"The weather is very beautiful.\"    \"Good-day,\" she replied.    I continued to eat cheese, and reassured she walked on past me. Twenty  yards beyond, the Grand Duke was waiting. As I laid down my knife upon  the paper which had been wrapped around the bread and cheese, and  raised the bottle to my lips, the enamoured nobleman stepped out from  the trees and bowed low before Zara el-Khala.    She started back from him--a movement of inimitable grace, like that  of a startled gazelle. And even before I had time to get upon my feet  she had raised a little silver whistle to her lips and blown a short  shrill note.    The Grand Duke, endeavouring to seize her hand, was pouring out  voluble expressions of adoration in execrable French, and Zara  el-Khala was retreating step by step. She had quickly thrown the veil  about her again. I heard the pad of swiftly running feet. If I was to  intervene before the arrival of the Hindu, I must act rapidly. I raced  along the path and thrust myself between the Grand Duke and the girl.    \"Mademoiselle,\" I said, \"is this gentleman annoying you?\"    \"How dare you, low pig!\" cried the Grand Duke, and with a sweep of his  powerful arm he hurled me aside.    \"Thank you,\" replied Zara el-Khala with great composure. \"But my  servant is here.\"    As I turned, Chunda Lal hurled himself upon the Grand Duke from behind.  I had never seen an expression in a man's eyes like that in the eyes  of the Hindu at this moment. They blazed like the eyes of a tiger, and  his teeth were bared in a savage grin which I cannot hope to describe.  His lean body seemed to shoot through the air, and he descended upon  his burly adversary as a jungle beast falls upon its prey. Those long  brown fingers clasping his neck, the Grand Duke fell forward upon his  face.    \"Chunda Lal!\" said the dancer.    Kneeling, his right knee thrust between the shoulder blades of the  prostrate man, the Hindu looked up--and I read murder in those glaring  eyes. That he was an accomplished wrestler--or perhaps a strangler--I  divined from the helplessness of the Grand Duke, who lay inert, robbed  of every power except that of his tongue. He was swearing savagely.    \"Chunda Lal!\" said Zara el-Khala again.  The Hindu shifted his grip from the neck to the arms of the Grand  Duke. He pinioned him as is done in _jiu-jitsu_ and forced him to  stand upright. It was a curious spectacle--the impotency of this burly  nobleman in the hands of his slight adversary. As they swayed to their  feet, I thought I saw the glint of metal in the right hand of the  Indian, but I could not be sure, for my attention was diverted. At  this moment Casimir appeared upon the scene, looking very frightened.    Suddenly releasing his hold altogether, the Hindu glaring into the  empurpled face of the Grand Duke, shot out one arm and pointed with a  quivering finger along the path.    \"Go!\" he said.    The Grand Duke clenched his fists, looked from face to face as if  calculating his chances, then shrugged his shoulders, very  deliberately wiped his neck and wrists, where the Indian had held him,  with a large silk handkerchief and threw the handkerchief on the  ground. I saw a speck of blood upon the silk. Without another glance  he walked away, Casimir following sheepishly. It is needless, perhaps,  to add that Casimir had not recognized me.    I turned to the dancer, touching the peak of my cap.    \"Can I be of any assistance to mademoiselle?\" I asked.    \"Thank you--no,\" she replied.    She placed five francs in my hand and set off rapidly through the  trees in the direction of the road, her bloodthirsty but faithful  attendant at her heels!    I stood scratching my head and looking after her.    That afternoon I posted a man acquainted with Hindustani to tap any  message which might be sent to or from the cafe used by Chunda Lal.  I learned that the Grand Duke had taken a stage box at the Montmartre  theatre at which the dancer was appearing, and I decided that I would  be present also.    A great surprise was in store for me.    Zara el-Khala had at this time established a reputation which  extended beyond those circles from which the regular patrons of this  establishment were exclusively drawn and which had begun to penetrate  to all parts of Paris. You will remember that it was the extraordinary  circumstance of her remaining at this obscure place of entertainment  so long which had first interested me in the lady. I had learned that  she had rejected a number of professional offers, and, as I have  already stated, I had assured myself of this unusual attitude by  presenting the card of a well-known Paris agency--and being refused  admittance.    Now, as I leaned upon the rail at the back of the auditorium and the  time for the dancer's appearance grew near, I could not fail to  observe that there was a sprinkling of evening-dress in the stalls  and that the two boxes already occupied boasted the presence of parties  of well-known men of fashion. Then the Grand Duke entered as a troupe  of acrobats finished their performance. Zara el-Khala was next upon  the programme. I glanced at the Grand Duke and thought that he looked  pale and unwell.    The tableau curtain fell and the manager appeared behind the footlights.  He, also, seemed to be much perturbed.    \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"I greatly regret to announce that  Mlle. Zara el-Kahla is indisposed and unable to appear. We have  succeeded in obtaining the services----\"    Of whom he had succeeded in obtaining the services I never heard, for  the rougher section of the audience rose at him like a menacing wave!  They had come to see the Egyptian dancer and they would have their  money back! It was a swindle; they would smash the theatre!    If one had doubted the great and growing popularity of Zara el-Kahla,  this demonstration must have proved convincing. Over the heads of the  excited audience, I saw the Grand Duke rise as if to retire. The other  box parties were also standing up and talking angrily.    \"Why was it not announced outside the theatre?\" someone shouted.  \"We did not know until twenty minutes ago!\" cried the manager in  accents of despair.    I hurried from the theatre and took a taxicab to the hotel of the  dancer. Running into the hall, I thrust a card in the hand of a  concierge who stood there.    \"Announce to Mlle. Zara el-Khala that I must see her at once,\" I said.    The man smiled and returned the card to me.    \"Mlle. Zara el-Khala left Paris at seven o'clock, monsieur!\"    \"What! I cried--left Paris!\"    \"But certainly. Her baskets were taken to the Gare du Nord an hour  earlier by her servant and she went off by the seven-fifty rapid for  Calais. The theatre people were here asking for her an hour ago.\"    I hurried to my office to obtain the latest reports of my men, I had  lost touch with them, you understand, during the latter part of the  afternoon and evening. I found there the utmost confusion. They had  been seeking me all over Paris to inform "]]]
