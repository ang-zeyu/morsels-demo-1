[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18845"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 7 (#13)"],[1,"these caves) the early Christians destined to  be eaten at the Coliseum shows, heard the wild beasts, hungry for them,  roaring down below; until, upon the night and solitude of their  captivity, there burst the sudden noon and life of the vast theater  crowded to the parapet, and of these, their dreaded neighbors, bounding  in!    Below the church of San Sebastiano, two miles beyond the gate of San  Sebastiano, on the Appian Way, is the entrance to the catacombs of  Rome--quarries in the old time, but afterward the hiding-places of the  Christians. These ghastly passages have been explored for twenty miles;  and form a chain of labyrinths, sixty miles in circumference.    A gaunt Franciscan friar, with a wild, bright eye, was our only guide,  down into this profound and dreadful place. The narrow ways and openings  hither and thither, coupled with the dead and heavy air, soon blotted  out, in all of us, any recollection of the track by which we had come;  and I could not help thinking: \"Good Heaven, if, in a sudden fit of  madness he should dash the torches out, or if he should be seized with a  fit, what would become of us!\" On we wandered, among martyrs' graves;  passing great subterranean vaulted roads, diverging in all directions,  and choked up with heaps of stones, that thieves and murderers may not  take refuge there, and form a population under Rome even worse than that  which lives between it and the sun. Graves, graves, graves; graves of  men, of women, of their little children, who ran crying to the  persecutors, \"We are Christians! We are Christians!\" that they might be  murdered with their parents; graves with the palm of martyrdom roughly  cut into their stone boundaries, and little niches, made to hold a  vessel of the martyrs' blood; graves of some who lived down here, for  years together, ministering to the rest, and preaching truth, and hope,  and comfort, from the rude altars, that bear witness to their fortitude  at this hour; more roomy graves, but far more terrible, where hundreds,  being surprized, were hemmed in and walled up; buried before death, and  killed by slow starvation.    Such are the spots and patches in my dream of churches, that remain  apart and keep their separate identity. I have a fainter recollection,  sometimes, of the relics; of the fragment of the pillar of the Temple  that was rent in twain; of the portion of the table that was spread for  the Last Supper; of the well at which the woman of Samaria gave water to  our Savior; of two columns from the house of Pontius Pilate; of the  stone to which the sacred hands were bound, when the scourging was  performed; of the grid-iron of Saint Lawrence, and the stone below it,  marked with the frying of his fat and blood; these set a shadowy mark on  some cathedrals, as an old story, or a fable might, and stop them for an  instant, as they flit before me. The rest is a vast wilderness of  consecrated buildings of all shapes and fancies, blending one with  another; of battered pillars of old Pagan temples, dug up from the  ground, and forced, like giant captives, to support the roofs of  Christian churches; of pictures, bad, and wonderful, and impious, and  ridiculous; of kneeling people, curling incense, tinkling bells, and  sometimes (but not often) of a swelling organ; of Madonne, with their  breasts stuck full of swords, arranged in a half-circle like a modern  fan; of actual skeletons of dead saints, hideously attired in gaudy  satins, silks, and velvets trimmed with gold; their withered crust of  skull adorned with precious jewels, or with chaplets of crusht flowers;  sometimes, of people gathered round the pulpit, and a monk within it  stretching out the crucifix, and preaching fiercely; the sun just  streaming down through some high window on the sail-cloth stretched  above him and across the church, to keep his high-pitched voice from  being lost among the echoes of the roof. Then my tired memory comes out  upon a flight of steps, where knots of people are asleep, or basking in  the light; and strolls away, among the rags and smells, and palaces, and  hovels, of an old Italian street.          THE CEMETERY OF THE CAPUCHINS[23]    BY NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE      The cemetery is beneath the church, but entirely above ground, and  lighted by a row of iron-grated windows without glass. A corridor runs  along besides these windows, and gives access to three or four vaulted  recesses, or chapels, of considerable breadth and height, the floor of  which consists of the consecrated earth of Jerusalem. It is smoothed  decorously over the deceased brethren of the convent, and is kept quite  free from grass or weeds, such as would grow even in these gloomy  recesses, if pains were not bestowed to root them up. But, as the  cemetery is small, and it is a precious privilege to sleep in holy  ground, the brotherhood are immemorially accustomed, when one of their  number dies, to take the longest-buried skeleton out of the oldest  grave, and lay the new slumberer there instead. Thus, each of the good  friars, in his turn, enjoys the luxury of a consecrated bed, attended  with the slight drawback of being forced to get up long before daybreak,  as it were, and make room for another lodger.    The arrangement of the unearthed skeletons is what makes the special  interest of the cemetery. The arched and vaulted walls of the burial  recesses are supported by massive pillars and pilasters made of  thigh-bones and skulls; the whole material of the structure appears to  be of a similar kind; and the knobs and embossed ornaments of this  strange architecture are represented by the joints of the spine, and the  more delicate tracery by the smaller bones of the human frame. The  summits of the arches are adorned with entire skeletons, looking as if  they were wrought most skilfully in bas-relief. There is no possibility  of describing how ugly and grotesque is the effect, combined with a  certain artistic merit, nor how much perverted ingenuity has been shown  in this queer way, nor what a multitude of dead monks, through how many  hundred years, must have contributed their bony framework to build up  these great arches of mortality. On some of the skulls there are  inscriptions, purporting that such a monk, who formerly made use of that  particular head-piece, died on such a day and year; but vastly the  greater number are piled up indistinguishably into the architectural  design like the many deaths that make up the one glory of a victory.    In the side walls of the vaults are niches where skeleton monks sit or  stand, clad in the brown habits that they wore in life, and labeled  with their names and the dates of their decease. Their skulls (some  quite bare, and others still covered with yellow skin, and hair that has  known the earth-damps) look out from beneath their hoods, grinning,  hideously repulsive. One reverend father has his mouth wide open, as if  he had died in the midst of a howl of terror and remorse, which perhaps  is even now screeching through eternity. As a general thing, however,  these frocked and hooded skeletons seem to take a more cheerful view of  their position, and try with ghastly smiles to turn it into a jest. But  the cemetery of the Capuchins is no place to nourish celestial hopes;  the soul sinks forlorn and wretched under all this burden of dusty  death; the holy earth from Jerusalem, so imbued is it with mortality,  has grown as barren of the flowers of Paradise as it is of earthly weeds  and grass. Thank Heaven for its blue sky; it needs a long, upward gaze  to give us back our faith. Not here can we feel ourselves immortal,  where the very altars in these chapels of horrible consecration are  heaps of human bones.          THE BURIAL PLACE OF KEATS AND SHELLEY[24]    BY NATHANIEL PARKER WILLIS      A beautiful pyramid, a hundred and thirteen feet high, built into the  ancient wall of Rome, is the proud \"Sepulcher of Caius Cestius.\" It is  the most imperishable of the antiquities, standing as perfect after  eighteen hundred years as if it were built but yesterday. Just beyond  it, on the declivity of a hill, over the ridge of which the wall passes,  crowning it with two moldering towers, lies the Protestant  burying-ground.    It looks toward Rome, which appears in the distance, between Mount  Aventine and a small hill called Mont Testaccio, and leaning to the  south-east, the sun lies warm and soft upon its banks, and the grass and  wild flowers are there the earliest and tallest of the Campagna. I have  been here to-day, to see the graves of Keats and Shelley. With a  cloudless sky and the most delicious air ever breathed, we sat down upon  the marble slab laid over the ashes of poor Shelley, and read his own  lament over Keats, who sleeps just below, at the foot of the hill.    The cemetery is rudely formed into three terraces, with walks between,  and Shelley's grave and one other, without a name, occupy a small nook  above, made by the projections of a moldering wall-tower, and crowded  with ivy and shrubs, and a peculiarly fragrant yellow flower, which  perfumes the air around for several feet. The avenue by which you ascend  from the gate is lined with high bushes of the marsh-rose in the most  luxuriant bloom, and all over the cemetery the grass is thickly mingled  with flowers of every dye. In his preface to his lament over Keats,  Shelley says:    \"He was buried in the romantic and lonely cemetery of the Protestants,  under the pyramid which is the tomb of Cestius, and the massy walls and  towers, now moldering and desolate, which formed the circuit of ancient  Rome. It is an open space among the ruins, covered in winter with  violets and daisies. It might make one in love with death, to think that  one should be buried in so sweet a place.\"    If Shelley had chosen his own grave at the time, he would have selected  the very spot where he has since been laid--the most sequestered and  flowery"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18846"],[0,"Voodoo Planet (#13)"],[1,"Lumbrilo! I, Tau, of another star, another sky, another world, bid you  come forth and range your power against mine!\" Now there was a sharper  note in that demand, the snap of an order.    He was answered by another wave of the black negation--stronger, rolling  up to smash them down, as a wave in the heavy surf of a wild ocean  pounds its force against the beach. This time Dane thought he could see  that dark mass. He tore his eyes away before it took on substance,  concentrating on the movements of his hands against the drum head,  refusing to believe that hammer of power was rising to flatten them all.  He had heard Tau describe such things in the past. But told in familiar  quarters on board the _Queen_, such experiences were only stories. Here  was danger unleashed. Yet the medic stood unbowed as the wave broke upon  him in full.    And, advancing under the crest of that lick of destruction, came its  controller. This was no ghost drawn from the materials of the swamp;  this was a man, walking quietly, his hands as empty as Tau's, yet  grasping weapons none of them could see.    In the firelight, as the wave receded sullenly, men moaned, lay face  down upon the ground, beat their hands feebly against the earth. But, as  Lumbrilo came on from the shadows, one of them got to his hands and  knees, moving with small tortured jerks. He crawled toward Tau, his head  lolling on his shoulders as the head of the dead rock ape had done. Dane  patted the drum with one hand while, with the other, he groped for his  fire ray. He tried to shout in warning and found that he could not utter  a sound.    Tau's arm moved, raised from his side, made a circling motion.    The creeping man, his eyes rolled up in his head until only the whites  gleamed blindly in the limited light, followed that gesture. He drew  level with the medic, passed beyond toward Lumbrilo, whining as a hound  prevented from obeying his master might lament.    \"So be it, Lumbrilo,\" Tau said. \"This is between you and me. Or do you  not dare to risk your power against mine? Is Lumbrilo so weak a one that  he must send another to do his will?\"    Raising both hands again the medic brought them down, curling inward,  until he stooped and touched them to the ground. When he straightened  once again the knife was in his grasp and he tossed it behind him.    The smoke from the fire swirled out in a long tongue, coiled about  Lumbrilo and was gone. A black and white beast stood where the man had  been, its tufted tail lashing, its muzzle a mask of snarling hate and  blood lust.    But Tau met that transformation with laughter which was like the lash of  a whip.    \"We both be men, you and I, Lumbrilo. Meet me as a man and keep those  trickeries for those who have not the clear sight. A child plays as a  child, so--\" Tau's voice came in a rumble, but Tau was gone. The huge,  hairy thing which swayed in his place turned a gorilla's beast visage to  his enemy. For a breathless moment Terran ape confronted Khatkan lion.  Then the spaceman was himself again. \"The time for games is over, man of  Khatka. You have tried to hunt us to our deaths, have you not? Therefore  death shall be the portion of the loser now.\"    Lion vanished, man stood watching, alertly, as swordsman might face  swordsman with a blood feud lying on their blades. To Dane's eyes the  Khatkan made no move. Yet the fire leaped high, as if freshly fed, and  flames burst from the wood, flew into the air, red and perilous birds,  darting at Tau until they outlined him from the ground under his boots  to an arch over his head. They united and spun faster until Dane,  watching with dazzled eyes, saw the wheel become a blur of light, hiding  Tau within its fiery core. His own wrists ached with the strain of his  drumming as he lifted one hand and tried to shield his sight from the  glare of that pillar of fire.    Lumbrilo was chanting--a heavy blast of words. Dane stiffened; his  traitorous hands were falling into the rhythm of that other song!  Straightaway he raised both from the drum head, brought them down  in a discordinate series of thumps which bore no relation to either  the song Tau wanted or that which Lumbrilo was now crooning.  _Thump--thump--thump_--Dane beat it out frantically, belaboring the  drum head as he wanted to sink his fists home on the body of the  Khatkan witch doctor.    The pillar of fire swayed, fluttered as if a wind drove it--and was  gone. Tau, unmarked, smiled.    \"Fire!\" He pointed his fingers at Lumbrilo. \"Would you try earth, and  water, and air also, wizard? Call hither your whirlwind, up your flood,  summon the land to quake. None of those shall bring me down!\"    Shapes came flooding out of the night, some monstrous, some human,  streaming past Lumbrilo to crowd into the circle of firelight. Some Dane  thought he knew, some were strangers. Men wearing space uniforms, or the  dress of other worlds, women--they strode, wept, mingled with the  monsters to laugh, curse, threaten.    Dane guessed that Lumbrilo sent now against the Terran the harvest of  the medic's own memories. He shut his eyes against this enforced  intrusion upon another's past, but not before he saw Tau's face,  strained, fined to the well-shaped bones beneath the thin flesh, holding  still a twisted smile as he met each memory, accepted the pain it held  for him, and set it aside unshaken.    \"This, too, has no power any longer, man who walks in the dark.\"    Dane opened his eyes. Those crowding wraiths were fading, losing  substance. Lumbrilo crouched, his lips drawn back from his teeth, his  hatred plain to read.    \"I am not clay to be molded by your hands, Lumbrilo. And now I say that  the time has come to call an end--\"    Tau raised his hands slowly once again, holding them away from his body,  palms pointing earthward. And beneath them, on either side of the  spaceman, two black shadows gathered on the surface of the ground.    \"You have fettered yourself with your own bounds. As you have been the  hunter, so shall you now be the hunted.\"    Those shadows were growing as plants might issue from the packed soil of  the camping ground. When his hands were shoulder high, Tau held them  steady. Now on either side of his tautly held body crouched one of the  black-and-white lions with which Lumbrilo had identified his own brand  of magic throughout the year.    Lumbrilo's \"lion\" had been larger than life, more intelligent, more  dangerous, subtly different from the normal animal it counterfeited. So  now were these. And both of them raised their heads to gaze intently  into the medic's face.    \"Hunt well, brothers in fur,\" he said slowly, almost caressingly. \"Him  whom you hunt shall grant you sport in the going.\"    \"Stop it!\" A man leaped from the shadows behind the witch doctor.  Firelight made plain his off-world dress, and he swung up a blaster,  aiming at the nearest of the waiting beasts. That flash struck true, but  it neither killed nor even singed the fine fur of the animal's pelt.    As the blaster's aim was swung from beast to man, Dane fired first. His  ray brought a scream from the other, who dropped his weapon from a badly  seared hand to reel back, cursing.    Tau waved his hands gently. The great animal heads turned obediently,  until the red eyes were set on Lumbrilo. Facing them, the witch doctor  straightened, spat out his hate at the medic:    \"I do not run to be hunted, devil man!\"    \"I think you do, Lumbrilo. For you must taste fear now as you have made  other men drink of it, so that it fills your blood and races through  your body, clouds your mind to make of you less than a man. You have  hunted out those who doubted your power, who stood in your chosen path,  whom you wanted removed from the earth of Khatka. Do you doubt that they  wait in the last dark for you now, ready to greet you, witch doctor?  What they have known, you shall also know. This night you have shown me  all that lies in my past that is weak, that was evil, that I may regret  or find sorrow for. So shall you also remember through the few hours  left you. Aye, you _shall_ run, Lumbrilo!\"    As he spoke, Tau approached the other, the two black-and-white hunters  pacing beside him. Now he stooped and caught up a pinch of soil and spat  upon it three times. Then he threw the tiny clod of earth at the witch  doctor. It struck Lumbrilo just above the heart and the man reeled under  what might have been a murderous blow.    The Khatkan broke then, completely. With a wailing cry he whirled and  ran, crashing into the brush as one who runs blindly and without hope.  Behind him the two beasts leaped noiselessly together and all three were  gone.    Tau swayed, put his hand to his head. Dane kicked away the drum, arose  from his cramped position stiffly to go to him. But the medic was not  yet done. He returned to stand over the prostrate native hunters and he  clapped his hands sharply.    \"You are men, and you shall act as men henceforth. That which was, is no  longer. Stand free, for the dark power follows him who misused it, and  fear no longer eats from your basins, drinks from your cups, or lies  beside you on the sleep mats.\"    \"Tau!\" Jellico's shout reached them over the cries of the rousing  Khatkans. But Dane was there first, catching the medic before he slumped  to the ground; but he was dragged with that dead weight until he sat  with the medic's head on his shoulder, the other's body resting heavily  against him. For one horror-filled moment Dane feared that he did indeed  hold a dead man, that one of the outlaw Hunters must have struck a last  blow for his discredited leader. Then Tau sighed and began to breathe  deeply. Dane glanced up, amazed, at the captain.    \"He's asleep!\"    Jellico knelt and his hand went to test heart beat, then to touch the  medic's worn and dirty face. \"Best thing for him,\" he said briskly.  \"He's had it.\"    It took some time to get the facts of their triumph sorted "]]]
