[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16534"],[0,"A Young Folks' History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (#13)"],[1," little body of Saints had been threatened by mobs a number of times,  but on the 28th, a treaty of peace was made in which each party agreed not  to molest the other. Before this, however, Joseph had advised the Saints at  Haun's Mill to move into Far West, which advice they had not taken.    October 30th was a beautiful autumn day. The air was warm, and the breeze  stirred the fields of wheat and rustled the corn. The children were playing  on the banks of the creek, and their merry laugh was echoed by the birds in  the forest close at hand. All seemed peaceful and lovely.    [Illustration: HAUN'S MILL.]    About four o'clock in the afternoon, a company of two hundred and forty  men dashed up to the clearing. Brother David Evans who had command of the  few brethren, ran out to meet them, swinging his hat and crying, \"Peace,  peace.\" The leader of the mob told all who desired to save their lives and  make peace to run into the blacksmith shop. Some of the brethren did this,  but in a few seconds after, a volley was fired into the shop. The bullets  went between the logs, which were far apart, and in at the open door,  killing and wounding the brethren within. Some few shots were fired back,  but the brethren soon saw it was useless to resist, so they tried to save  themselves as best they could. Men, women and children scattered in every  direction taking refuge in the woods, while the bullets of the mobbers flew  thick and fast among them, wounding and killing.    The mob kept on firing at the shop until they thought all within were  killed; then they went about the place killing all they could find alive,  and robbing the houses of everything they could carry off. They even  stripped the dead and dying of their clothes. They went into the blacksmith  shop for this purpose, and there they saw dead men lying in piles, and  wounded men groaning in pain, while pools of blood stood on the floor. A  little ten year old boy named Sardius Smith had crawled under the bellows,  trying to hide from the wicked mobbers; but one of them saw him and dragged  him out. Then putting the muzzle of his gun to the boy's head he killed him  instantly. Sardius' little brother, Alma, seven years old had a great hole  shot in his hip; but he lay still, fearing that if he moved they would  shoot him again. Another boy by the name of Charles Merrick was discovered.  He pleaded with the mobbers not to kill him: \"I am an American boy,\" he  said \"O! don't kill me!\" The mobber heeded not, but blew out his brains.    Thomas McBride, an old, gray-haired man who had fought in the  Revolutionary War under Washington, gave up his gun to a mobber, and then  pleaded for his life. The cruel mobber took the gun and shot the old man  dead, and then another mobber cut him to pieces with an old corn cutter.    Thus it continued. I cannot tell you half of the horrible things which  happened. At last the mobbers departed, and night came on. Then, lowly and  fearfully, the women and children and what few men were left crept out of  their hiding places to see what had been done and to help as best they  could. Perhaps you can imagine what they saw and how they felt during that  long, dark night in the midst of dead and dying husbands, brothers and  sons.    Next morning it was found that nineteen men and boys were dead, or wounded  so badly that they could not live, and about fifteen others were wounded.  What to do with the dead was the question. There were not men enough to dig  graves; besides, the mob might come back again and finish their awful work;  so the best they could do was to put the nineteen bodies into a large, dry  well that was close by. This was done, and straw and earth placed on top.    Sister Smith, mother of Sardius and Alma, has told some of the experiences  which she passed through during that awful time. Her husband and one son  were killed, while another son had his hip nearly shot away. During that  first night she says that she prayed to God to know what to do for her  wounded boy, and the Lord distinctly whispered to her what kind of poultice  to put on the wound and how to treat him.    \"I removed the boy to a house next day,\" she says, \"and dressed his hip,  the Lord directing me as before.\"    \"'Alma, my child,' I said, 'you believe that the Lord made your hip?'    \"'Yes, mother.'    \"'Well, the Lord can make something there in place of your hip, don't you  believe he can, Alma?'    \"'Do you think that the Lord can, mother?'    \"'Yes, my son,' I replied, 'He has shown it all to me in a vision.'    \"And then I laid him comfortably on his face and said: 'Now you lay like  that and don't move, and the Lord will make you another hip.'    \"So I laid Alma on his face for five weeks, until he was entirely  recovered, a flexible gristle having grown in place of the missing joint  and socket.\"    Alma grew up to be a man and became a useful member of the Church.

Wild reports now went over the country about the \"Mormons;\" and to make  these reports seem true some of the mobbers actually set fire to their own  log cabins and then accused the Saints of the act.    In a previous chapter, mention was made of Lilburn W. Boggs. This man was  now governor of the state, and we shall see how he used his power against  the \"Mormons,\" whom he hated so much.    The reports that the \"Mormons\" were burning houses and driving people from  their homes, reached the governor, and he believed, or pretended to  believe, all these false stories. So he gave orders to the officers of the  state militia to organize an army of 2,000 men, march to the scene of the  trouble, and see that the people whom the \"Mormons\" had driven from their  homes were returned to them. Note how eager the governor was to restore  these few presumably abused people to their lands--but it was all right  that twelve hundred \"Mormons\" should be driven from their property!    The next day after the governor had issued this order, the news of the  Crooked River battle reached him, so he changed his instructions to the  commanding officer, General Clark. This order, given October 27, 1838, is  known as Governor Boggs' exterminating order, and is one of the most  disgraceful and wicked commands known in history. Exterminate means to  destroy utterly, to root out completely, and this is what a governor of a  state said should be done to twelve thousand innocent people if they did  not leave the state.    Companies of Missouri militia now came marching from various parts of the  state into Caldwell and other counties nearby. Soon Far West was surrounded  by an army. Niel Gillium was there with his band of men in Indian costume,  who whooped and yelled like true savages. On the evening of October 30th, a  party of men came fresh from the awful massacre, at Haun's Mill, eager for  more blood. Thus the town was surrounded, and as it seemed, doomed to  destruction.    The few brethren in Far West prepared to defend themselves as best they  could. It might appear useless for a handful of men to oppose an army, but  when men are fighting for their homes, their liberty, their wives and their  children, a few can do mighty deeds.    But they were not to fight. Traitors were in the camp of the Saints and  they now betrayed their brethren into the hands of the enemy. Colonel  George M. Hinkle was the commander of the Far West militia, and he went to  the mob commanders and promised to deliver up to them the Church leaders.  He also made an agreement with them that the Saints would deliver up their  arms, sign away their property to pay the expenses of the war, and then  leave the state. This was all done without the knowledge of the \"Mormons\"  or their leaders.    On the evening of October 30th, Colonel Hinkle told Joseph Smith, Sidney  Rigdon, Parley P. Pratt, Lyman Wight, and George W. Robinson that the  officers of the mob-militia wanted to consult with them and try to arrange  matters. Next morning these brethren went with Hinkle some distance out of  Far West where they were met by General Lucas, and soon most of the mob  came up. Lucas ordered his men to surround the brethren, when Hinkle  stepped up and said:    \"General Lucas, these are the prisoners I agreed to deliver to you.\"    The brethren were then marched into the camp of the mob-militia where they  were received with great shouts, curses, and yells. All that night they  were compelled to lie on the cold ground, and it rained before morning. The  next day Hyrum Smith and Amasa M. Lyman were brought as prisoners into  camp.    That day General Lucas demanded the arms of the \"Mormons,\" promising them  protection, and the return of their guns after the trouble was over; but no  sooner had the mob obtained possession of the arms then they began stealing  and carrying away everything they could lay their hands on. They also  destroyed much property and abused innocent women and children. Those of  the brethren that had property were compelled to sign it away to the mob.    On the evening of November 1st, General Lucas held a court in which Joseph  and his brethren were to be tried. This court was composed of seventeen  preachers and some army officers. None of the prisoners were present, and  knew nothing of what was going on. The brethren were found guilty and  sentenced to be shot next morning at eight, o'clock, on the public square  in Far West. When the sentence was passed Generals Doniphan and Graham said  it was murder, and they would have nothing to do with it. This checked  Lucas in his evil designs and so they decided to take the prisoners to  Jackson"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16545"],[0,"King Alfred of England (#13)"],[1," of the coming day. Some slept; others  watched restlessly, and talked together, sleepless under the influence  of that strange excitement, half exhilaration and half fear, which  prevails in a camp on the eve of a battle. The camp fires burned  brightly all the night, and the sentinels kept vigilant watch,  expecting every moment some sudden alarm.    The night passed quietly away. Ethelred and Alfred both arose early.  Alfred went out to arouse and muster the men in his division of the  encampment, and to prepare for battle. Ethelred, on the other hand,  sent for his priest, and, assembling the officers in immediate  attendance upon him, commenced divine service in his tent--the service  of the mass, according to the forms and usages which, even in that  early day, were prescribed by the Catholic Church. Alfred was thus  bent on immediate and energetic action, while Ethelred thought that  the hour for putting forth the exertion of human strength did not come  until time had been allowed for completing, in the most deliberate and  solemn manner, the work of imploring the protection of Heaven.    Ethelred seems by his conduct on this occasion to have inherited from  his father, even more than Alfred, the spirit of religious devotion at  least so far as the strict and faithful observance of religious forms  was concerned. There was, it is true, a particular reason in this case  why the forms of divine service should be faithfully observed, and  that is, that the war was considered in a great measure a religious  war. The Danes were pagans. The Saxons were Christians. In making  their attacks upon the dominions of Ethelred, the ruthless invaders  were animated by a special hatred of the name of Christ, and they  evinced a special hostility toward every edifice, or institution, or  observance which bore the Christian name. The Saxons, therefore, in  resisting them, felt that they were not only fighting for their own  possessions and for their own lives, but that they were defending  the kingdom of God, and that he, looking down from his throne in  the heavens, regarded them as the champions of his cause; and,  consequently, that he would either protect them in the struggle, or,  if they fell, that he would receive them to mansions of special glory  and happiness in heaven, as martyrs who had shed their blood in his  service and for his glory.    Taking this view of the subject, Ethelred, instead of going out to  battle at the early dawn, collected his officers into his tent, and  formed them into a religious congregation. Alfred, on the other hand,  full of impetuosity and ardor, was arousing his men, animating them by  his words of encouragement and by the influence of his example, and  making, as energetically as possible, all the preparations necessary  for the approaching conflict.    In fact, Alfred, though his brother was king, and he himself only a  lieutenant general under him, had been accustomed to take the lead in  all the military operations of the army, on account of the superior  energy, resolution, and tact which he evinced, even in this early  period of his life. His brothers, though they retained the scepter, as  it fell successively into their hands, relied mainly on his wisdom and  courage in all their efforts to defend it, and Ethelred may have been  somewhat more at his ease, in listening to the priest's prayers in his  tent, from knowing that the arrangements for marshaling and directing  a large part of the force were in such good hands.    The two encampments of Alfred and Ethelred seem to have been at some  little distance from each other. Alfred was impatient at Ethelred's  delay. He asked the reason for it. They told him that Ethelred was  attending mass, and that he had said he should on no account leave his  tent until the service was concluded. Alfred, in the mean time, took  possession of a gentle elevation of land, which now would give him an  advantage in the conflict. A single thorn-tree, growing there alone,  marked the spot. The Danes advanced to attack him, expecting that, as  he was not sustained by Ethelred's division of the army, he would be  easily overpowered and driven from his post.    Alfred himself felt an extreme and feverish anxiety at Ethelred's  delay. He fought, however, with the greatest determination and  bravery. The thorn-tree continued to be the center of the conflict for  a long time, and, as the morning advanced, it became more and more  doubtful how it would end. At last, Ethelred, having finished his  devotional services, came forth from his camp at the head of his  division, and advanced vigorously to his faltering brother's aid.  This soon decided the contest. The Danes were overpowered and put to  flight. They fled at first in all directions, wherever each separate  band saw the readiest prospect of escape from the immediate vengeance  of their pursuers. They soon, however, all began with one accord  to seek the roads which would conduct them to their stronghold at  Reading. They were madly pursued, and massacred as they fled, by  Alfred's and Ethelred's army. Vast numbers fell. The remnant secured  their retreat, shut themselves up within their walls, and began to  devote their eager and earnest attention to the work of repairing and  making good their defenses.    This victory changed for the time being the whole face of affairs,  and led, in various ways, to very important consequences, the most  important of which was, as we shall presently see, that it was the  means indirectly of bringing Alfred soon to the throne. As to  the cause of the victory, or, rather, the manner in which it was  accomplished, the writers of the times give very different accounts,  according as their respective characters incline them to commend, in  man, a feeling of quiet trust and confidence in God when placed in  circumstances of difficulty or danger, or a vigorous and resolute  exertion of his own powers. Alfred looked for deliverance to the  determined assaults and heavy blows which he could bring to bear upon  his pagan enemies with weapons of steel around the thorn-tree in the  field. Ethelred trusted to his hope of obtaining, by his prayers  in his tent, the effectual protection of Heaven; and they who have  written the story differ, as they who read it will on the question to  whose instrumentality the victory is to be ascribed. One says that  Alfred gained it by his sword. Another, that Alfred exerted his  strength and his valor in vain, and was saved from defeat and  destruction only by the intervention of Ethelred, bringing with him  the blessing of Heaven.    In fact, the various narratives of these ancient events, which are  found at the present day in the old chronicles that record them,  differ always very essentially, not only in respect to matters of  opinion, and to the point of view in which they are to be regarded,  but also in respect to questions of fact. Even the place where this  battle was fought, notwithstanding what we have said about the  derivation of Aston from AEscesdune, is not absolutely certain. There  is in the same vicinity another town, called Ashbury, which claims the  honor. One reason for supposing that this last is the true locality is  that there are the ruins of an ancient monument here, which, tradition  says, was a monument built to commemorate the death of a Danish  chieftain slain here by Alfred. There is also in the neighborhood  another very singular monument, called The White Horse, which also  has the reputation of having been fashioned to commemorate Alfred's  victories. The White Horse is a rude representation of a horse, formed  by cutting away the turf from the steep slope of a hill, so as to  expose a portion of the white surface of the chalky rock below of such  a form that the figure is called a horse, though they who see it seem  to think it might as well have been called a dog. The name, however,  of _The White Horse_ has come down with it from ancient times, and  the hill on which it is cut is known as The White Horse Hill. Some  ingenious antiquarians think they find evidence that this gigantic  profile was made to commemorate the victory obtained by Alfred and  Ethelred over the Danes at the ancient AEscesdune.    However this may be, and whatever view we may take of the comparative  influence of Alfred's energetic action and Ethelred's religious faith  in the defeat of the Danes at this great battle, it is certain that  the results of it were very momentous to all concerned. Ethelred  received a wound, either in this battle or in some of the smaller  contests and collisions which followed it, under the effects of which  he pined and lingered for some months, and then died. Alfred, by his  decision and courage on the day of the battle, and by the ardor and  resolution with which he pressed all the subsequent operations during  the period of Ethelred's decline, made himself still more conspicuous  in the eyes of his countrymen than he had ever been before. In looking  forward to Ethelred's approaching death, the people, accordingly,  began to turn their eyes to Alfred as his successor. There were  children of some of his older brothers living at that time, and they,  according to all received principles of hereditary right, would  naturally succeed to the throne; but the nation seems to have thought  that the crisis was too serious, and the dangers which threatened  their country were too imminent, to justify putting any child upon the  throne. The accession of one of those children would have been the  signal for a terrible and protracted struggle among powerful relatives  and friends for the regency during the minority of the youthful  sovereign, and this, while the Danes remained in their strong-hold at  Reading, in daily expectation of new re-enforcements from beyond the  sea, would have plunged the country in hopeless ruin. They turned  their eyes toward Alfred, therefore, as the sovereign to whom they "]]]
