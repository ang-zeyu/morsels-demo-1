The French, however, retreated, and  Buonaparte fixed his headquarters at Verona. The whole country between  the Brenta and the Adige was in the enemy's hands; while the still  strong and determined garrison of Mantua in Napoleon's rear, rendering  it indispensable for him to divide his forces, made his position  eminently critical.    His first care was to visit the discomfited troops of Vaubois. \"You have  displeased me,\" said he, \"you have suffered yourselves to be driven from  positions where a handful of determined men might have bid an army  defiance. You are no longer French soldiers! You belong not to the army  of Italy.\" At these words, tears streamed down the rugged cheeks of the  grenadiers. \"Place us but once more in the van,\" cried they, \"and you  shall judge whether we do not belong to the army of Italy.\" The general  dropped his angry tone; and in the rest of the campaign no troops more  distinguished themselves than these.    Having thus revived the ardour of his soldiery, Buonaparte concentrated  his columns on the right of the Adige, while Alvinzi took up a very  strong position on the heights of Caldiero, on the left bank, nearly  opposite to Verona. In pursuance of the same system which had already so  often proved fatal to his opponents, it was the object of Buonaparte to  assault Alvinzi, and scatter his forces, ere they could be joined by  Davidowich. He lost no time, therefore, in attacking the heights of  Caldiero; but in spite of all that Massena, who headed the charge, could  do, the Austrians, strong in numbers and in position, repelled the  assailants with great carnage. A terrible tempest prevailed during the  action, and Napoleon, in his despatches, endeavoured to shift the blame  to the elements.    The country behind Caldiero lying open to Davidowich, it became  necessary to resort to other means of assault, or permit the dreaded  junction to occur. The genius of Buonaparte suggested to him on this  occasion a movement altogether unexpected. During the night, leaving  1,500 men under Kilmaine to guard Verona, he marched for some space  rearwards, as if he had meant to retreat on Mantua, which the failure of  his recent assault rendered not unlikely. But his columns were ere long  wheeled again towards the Adige: and finding a bridge ready prepared,  were at once placed on the same side of the river with the enemy,--but  in the rear altogether of his position, amidst those wide-spreading  morasses which cover the country about Arcola. This daring movement was  devised to place Napoleon between Alvinzi and Davidowich; but the unsafe  nature of the ground, and the narrowness of the dykes, by which alone he  could advance on Arcola, rendered victory difficult, and reverse most  hazardous. He divided his men into three columns, and charged at  daybreak (Nov. 15) by the three dykes which conduct to Arcola. The  Austrian, not suspecting that the main body of the French had evacuated  Verona, treated this at first as an affair of light troops; but as day  advanced the truth became apparent, and these narrow passages were  defended with the most determined gallantry. Augereau headed the first  column that reached the bridge of Arcola, and was there, after a  desperate effort, driven back with great loss. Buonaparte, perceiving  the necessity of carrying the point ere Alvinzi could arrive, now threw  himself on the bridge, and seizing a standard, urged his grenadiers once  more to the charge.    The fire was tremendous: once more the French gave way. Napoleon  himself, lost in the tumult, was borne backwards, forced over the dyke,  and had nearly been smothered in the morass, while some of the advancing  Austrians were already between him and his baffled column. His imminent  danger was observed: the soldiers caught the alarm, and rushing  forwards, with the cry, \"Save the general,\" overthrew the Germans with  irresistible violence, plucked Napoleon from the bog, and carried the  bridge. This was the first battle of Arcola.    This movement revived in the Austrian lines their terror for the name of  Buonaparte; and Alvinzi saw that no time was to be lost if he meant to  preserve his communication with Davidowich. He abandoned Caldiero, and  gaining the open country behind Arcola, robbed his enemy for the moment  of the advantage which his skill had gained. Napoleon, perceiving that  Arcola was no longer in the rear of his enemy but in his front, and  fearful lest Vaubois might be overwhelmed by Davidowich, while Alvinzi  remained thus between him and the Brenta, evacuated Arcola, and  retreated to Ronco.    Next morning, having ascertained that Davidowich had not been engaged  with Vaubois, Napoleon once more advanced upon Arcola. The place was  once more defended bravely, and once more it was carried. But this  second battle of Arcola proved no more decisive than the first; for  Alvinzi still contrived to maintain his main force unbroken in the  difficult country behind; and Buonaparte again retreated to Ronco.    The third day was decisive. On this occasion also he carried Arcola;  and, by two stratagems, was enabled to make his victory effectual. An  ambuscade, planted among some willows, suddenly opened fire on a column  of Croats, threw them into confusion, and, rushing from the concealment,  crushed them down into the opposite bog, where most of them died.  Napoleon was anxious to follow up this success by charging the Austrian  main body on the firm ground behind the marshes. But it was no easy  matter to reach them there. He had, in various quarters, portable  bridges ready for crossing the ditches and canals; but the enemy stood  in good order, and three days' hard fighting had nearly exhausted his  own men. In one of his conversations at St. Helena, he thus told the  sequel. \"At Arcola I gained the battle with twenty-five horsemen. I  perceived the critical moment of lassitude in either army--when the  oldest and bravest would have been glad to be in their tents. All my men  had been engaged. Three times I had been obliged to re-establish the  battle. There remained to me but some twenty-five _Guides_. I sent them  round on the flank of the enemy with three trumpets, bidding them blow  loud and charge furiously. _Here is the French cavalry_, was the cry;  and they took to flight.\"... The Austrians doubted not that Murat and  all the horse had forced a way through the bogs; and at that moment  Buonaparte commanding a general assault in front, the confusion became  hopeless. Alvinzi retreated finally, though in decent order, upon  Montebello.    It was at Arcola that Muiron, who ever since the storming of Little  Gibraltar had lived on terms of brotherlike intimacy with Napoleon,  seeing a bomb about to explode threw himself between it and his general,  and thus saved his life at the cost of his own. Napoleon, to the end of  his life, remembered and regretted this heroic friend.    In these three days Buonaparte lost 8000 men: the slaughter among his  opponents must have been terrible. Davidowich, in never coming up to  join Alvinzi after his success over Vaubois, and Wurmser, in remaining  quiet at Mantua, when by advancing with his garrison he might have  incommoded the French rear, were guilty of grievous misjudgment or  indecision. Once more the rapid combinations of Napoleon had rendered  all the efforts of the Austrian cabinet abortive. For two months after  the last day of Arcola, he remained the undisturbed master of Lombardy.  All that his enemy could show, in set-off for the slaughter and  discomfiture of Alvinzi's campaign, was that they retained possession of  Bassano and Trent, thus interrupting Buonaparte's access to the Tyrol  and Germany. This advantage was not trivial; but it had been dearly  bought.    A fourth army had been baffled; but the resolution of the Imperial Court  was indomitable, and new levies were diligently forwarded to reinforce  Alvinzi. Once more (January 7, 1797) the Marshal found himself at the  head of 60,000: once more his superiority over Napoleon's muster-roll  was enormous; and once more he descended from the mountains with the  hope of relieving Wurmser and reconquering Lombardy. The fifth act of  the tragedy was yet to be performed.    We may here pause to notice some civil events of importance which  occurred ere Alvinzi made his final descent. The success of the French  naturally gave new vigour to the Italian party, who, chiefly in the  large towns, were hostile to Austria, and desirous to settle their own  government on the republican model. Napoleon had by this time come to be  anything but a Jacobin in his political sentiments: his habits of  command; his experience of the narrow and ignorant management of the  Directory; his personal intercourse with the ministers of sovereign  powers; his sense daily strengthened by events, that whatever good was  done in Italy proceeded from his own skill and the devotion of his  army,--all these circumstances conspired to make him respect himself and  contemn the government, almost in despite of which he had conquered  kingdoms for France. He therefore regarded now with little sympathy the  aspirations after republican organisation which he had himself  originally stimulated among the northern Italians. He knew, however,  that the Directory had, by absurd and extravagant demands, provoked the  Pope to break off the treaty of Bologna, and to raise his army to the  number of 40,000,--that Naples had every disposition to back his  Holiness with 30,000 soldiers, provided any reverse should befall the  French in Lombardy,--and, finally, that Alvinzi was rapidly preparing  for another march, with numbers infinitely superior to what he could  himself extort from the government of Paris;[11] and considering these  circumstances, he felt himself compelled to seek strength by gratifying  his Italian friends.

It is a brain-splitting language. Before I went to Russia I was  told that two words would carry me through the Empire: \"Nichevo\" meaning  \"never mind,\" and \"Seechas\" which means \"immediately\" or \"to-morrow\" or  \"next week.\" But we had to study every moment to learn as much Russian  as possible, as of course the soldiers could not understand any other  language. French is understood everywhere in society, but in the shops  no other tongue than Russian is any use. German is understood pretty  widely--but it is absolutely forbidden now to be spoken under penalty of  a 3000 rouble fine. In all the hotels there is a big notice put up in  Russian, French, and English in the public rooms \"It is forbidden to  speak German,\" and just at first it added rather to the complications of  life not to be able to use it.          VII    OUR WORK IN WARSAW      In two or three days' time after our visit to the Empress we were off to  Warsaw and reported ourselves to Monsieur Goochkoff, the head of the Red  Cross Society there.    We received our marching orders at once. We were not to be together at  first, as they thought we should learn Russian more quickly if we were  separated, so two of us were to go to one hospital in Warsaw, two to  another. My fate was a large Red Cross hospital close to the station,  worked by a Community of Russian Sisters. I must say I had some anxious  moments as I drove with Sister G. to the hospital that afternoon. I  wondered if Monsieur Goochkoff had said we were coming, and thought if  two Russian Sisters suddenly turned up without notice at an English  hospital how very much surprised they would be. Then I hoped they were  very busy, as perhaps then they would welcome our help. But again, I  meditated, if they were really busy, we with our stumbling Russian  phrases might be only in the way. It was all very well in Denmark to  think one would come and help Russia--but supposing they did not want us  after all?    By the time I got so far we had arrived at the hospital, the old  familiar hospital smell of disinfectants met my nostrils, and I felt at  home at once. I found that I had been tormenting myself in vain, for  they were expecting us and apparently were not at all displeased at our  arrival. The Sister Superior had worked with English people in the  Russo-Japanese War and spoke English almost perfectly, and several of  the other Sisters spoke French or German. She was very worried as to  where we should sleep, as they were dreadfully overcrowded themselves;  even she had shared her small room with another Sister. However, she  finally found us a corner in a room which already held six Sisters.  Eight of us in a small room with only one window! The Sisters sleeping  there took our advent like angels, said there was plenty of room, and  moved their beds closer together so that we might have more space.  Again I wondered whether if it were England we should be quite so  amiable under like circumstances. I hope so.    I began to unpack, but there was nowhere to put anything; there was no  furniture in the room whatsoever except our straw beds, a table, and a  large tin basin behind a curtain in which we all washed--and, of course,  the ikon or holy picture which hangs in every Russian room. We all kept  our belongings under our beds--not a very hygienic proceeding, but _a la  guerre comme a la guerre_. The patients were very overcrowded too, every  corridor was lined with beds, and the sanitars, or orderlies, slept on  straw mattresses in the hall. The hospital had been a large college and  was originally arranged to hold five hundred patients, but after the  last big battle at Soldau every hospital in Warsaw was crammed with  wounded, and more than nine hundred patients had been sent in here and  had to be squeezed into every available corner.    My work was in the dressing-room, which meant dressing wounds all day  and sometimes well into the night, and whatever time we finished there  were all the dressings for the next day to be cut and prepared before  we could go to bed. The first week was one long nightmare with the awful  struggle for the Russian names of dressings and instruments and with  their different methods of working, but after that I settled down very  happily.    Sister G. was in the operating-room on the next floor, and she, too,  found that first week a great strain. The other two Sisters who had come  out with us and had been sent to another hospital apparently found the  same, for they returned to England after the first five days, much to my  disappointment, as I had hoped that our little unit of four might have  got a small job of our own later, when we could speak Russian better and  had learnt their ways and customs.    After the first few days we began to be very busy. In England we should  consider that hospital very badly staffed, as there were only twenty  Sisters to sometimes nearly a thousand patients, all very serious cases  moreover, as we were not supposed to take in the lightly wounded at all  in this hospital. The sanitars, or orderlies, do all that probationers  in an English hospital would do for the patients, and all the heavy  lifting and carrying, so that the work is not very hard though very  continuous. There was no night staff. We all took it in turns to stay up  at night three at a time, so that our turn came about once a week. That  meant being on duty all day, all night, and all the next day, except for  a brief rest and a walk in the afternoon. Most of the Sisters took no  exercise beyond one weekly walk, but we two English people longed for  fresh air, and went out whenever possible even if it was only for ten  minutes. English views on ventilation are not at all accepted in Russia.  It is a great concession to open the windows of the ward for ten minutes  twice a day to air it, and the Sisters were genuinely frightened for the  safety of the patients when I opened the windows of a hot, stuffy ward  one night. \"It is _never_ done,\" they reiterated, \"before daylight.\"    The Sister Superior was the mainspring of the hospital. She really was a  wonderful person, small and insignificant to look at, except for her  eyes, which looked you through and through and weighed you in the  balance; absolutely true and straight, with a heart of gold, and the  very calmest person in all the world. I remember her, late one evening,  when everybody was rather agitated at a message which had come to say  that 400 patients were on their way to the hospital, and room could only  be made for 200 at the most. \"Never mind,\" she said, not in the least  perturbed, \"they must be made as comfortable as possible on stretchers  for the night, and to-morrow we must get some of the others moved away.\"  And the Sisters took their cue from her, and those 400 patients were all  taken in and looked after with less fuss than the arrival of forty  unexpected patients in most hospitals.    All night long that procession of shattered men brought in on stretchers  never ceased. The kitchen Sister stayed up all night so that each man  should have some hot soup on arrival, and all the other Sisters were at  their posts. Each man was undressed on the stretcher (often so badly  wounded that all his clothing had to be cut off him) and hastily  examined by the doctor. He was then dressed in a clean cotton shirt and  trousers and lifted into bed, either to enjoy a bowl of hot soup, or,  if the case was urgent, to be taken off in his turn to the  operating-room. And though she was no longer young and not at all  strong, there was dear Sister Superior herself all night, taking round  the big bowls of soup or sitting beside the dying patients to cheer and  comfort their last hours. How the men loved her.    It was she who gave the whole tone to the hospital--there the patients  and their welfare were the first consideration and nothing else mattered  in comparison. The hospital was not \"smart\" or \"up to date,\" the wards  were not even tidy, the staff was inadequate, overworked, and  villainously housed, the resources very scanty, but for sheer  selflessness and utter devotion to their work the staff of that hospital  from top to bottom could not have been surpassed. I never heard a  grumble or a complaint all the time I was there either from a doctor, a  Sister, or an orderly, and I never saw in this hospital a dressing  slurred over, omitted, or done without the usual precautions however  tired or overworked everybody might be.    Of course the art of nursing as practised in England does not exist in  Russia--even the trained Sisters do things every hour that would horrify  us in England. One example of this is their custom of giving strong  narcotic or stimulating drugs indiscriminately, such as morphine,  codeine, camphor, or ether without doctors' orders. When untrained  Sisters and inexperienced dressers do this (which constantly happens)  the results are sometimes very deplorable. I have myself seen a dresser  give a strong hypodermic stimulant to a man with a very serious  haemorrhage. The bleeding vessel was deep down and very difficult to  find, and the haemorrhage became so severe after the stimulant that for a  long time his life was despaired of from extreme exhaustion due to loss  of blood. I have also heard a Sister with no training except the two  months' war course say she had given a certain man _ten_ injections of  camphor within an hour because he was so collapsed, but she had not seen  fit to tell the doctor she had done this, nor had she let him know his  patient was so much worse until he was at the point of death. Neither of  these particular incidents could have happened in the Red Cross  hospital at Warsaw as the Sisters there were properly trained; but even  there they gave drugs at their own sweet will without consulting  anyone--particularly in the night.    We were so busy at the hospital that we did not see"]]]
