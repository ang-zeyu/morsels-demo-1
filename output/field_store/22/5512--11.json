With you, Sir, I have  not drunk.    PIEPENBRINK _(striking the table_). That was a good one!    SENDEN _(hotly)_. You thrust yourself in here!    BOLZ _(indignantly)_. Thrust myself in?    PIEPENBRINK. Thrust himself in? Old man, you have an entrance ticket,  I suppose?    BOLZ _(frankly)_. Here is my ticket! It is not you I am showing it to,  but this honorable man from whom you are trying to estrange me by  your attack. Kaempe, give your ticket to Mr. Piepenbrink. He is the man  to judge of all the tickets in the world!    PIEPENBRINK. Here are two tickets just exactly as valid as my own.  Why, you scattered them right and left like sour grape juice. Oho! I  see quite well how things stand! I'm not one of your crowd, either,  but you want to get me. That's why you came to my house again and  again--because you expected to capture me. Because I am a voter,  that's why you're after me. But because this honorable man is not a  voter he does not count for you at all. We know those smooth tricks!    SENDEN. But, Mr. Piepenbrink!    PIEPENBRINK _(interrupting him, more angrily)_. Is that any reason for  insulting a peaceful guest? Is it a reason for closing my wife's  mouth? It is an injustice to this man, and he shall stay here as long  as I do. And he shall stay here by my side. And whoever attempts to  attack him will have to deal with me!    BOLZ. Your fist, good sir! You're a faithful comrade! And so  hand-in-hand with you Philip, I defy the Capulet and his entire clan!    PIEPENBRINK. Philip! Right you are, Conrad, my boy! Come here! They  shall swell with anger till they burst! Here's to Philip and Conrad!  _[They drink brotherhood.]_    BOLZ. Long live Piepenbrink!    PIEPENBRINK. So, old chum! Shall I tell you what! Since we are having  so good a time I think we'll leave all these people to their own  devices, and all of you come home with me. I'll brew a punch and we'll  sit together as merrily as jackdaws. I'll escort you, Conrad, and the  rest of you go ahead.    SENDEN _(and guests)_. But do listen, _revered_ Mr. Piepenbrink!    PIEPENBRINK. I'll listen to nothing. I'm done with you!    _Enter_ BELLMAUS _and other guests_.    BELLMAUS _(hurrying through the crowd_). Here I am!    BOLZ. My nephew! Gracious Madam, I put him under your protection!  Nephew, you escort Madam Piepenbrink. (MRS. PIEPENBRINK _takes a firm  grip on_ BELLMAUS'S _arm and holds him securely. Polka behind the  scene.)_ Farewell, gentlemen, it's beyond your power to spoil our good  humor. There, the music is striking up! We march off in a jolly  procession, and again I cry in conclusion, Long live Piepenbrink!    THE DEPARTING ONES. Long live Piepenbrink! _[They march off in  triumph_. FRITZ KLEINMICHEL _and his fiancee,_ KAeMPE _with_  KLEINMICHEL, MRS. PIEPENBRINK _with_ BELLMAUS, _finally_ BOLZ _with_  PIEPENBRINK.]    _Enter_ COLONEL.    COLONEL. What's going on here?    SENDEN. An outrageous scandal! The _Union_ has kidnapped our two most  important voters!          ACT III      SCENE I      _The_ COLONEL'S _Summer Parlor_.    _The_ COLONEL _in front, walking rapidly up and down. In the rear_,  ADELAIDE _and_ IDA _arm-in-arm, the latter in great agitation. A short  pause. Then enter_ SENDEN.    SENDEN (_hastily calling through centre door_).    All goes well! 37 votes against 29.    COLONEL.    Who has 37 votes?    SENDEN.    Why you, Colonel, of course!    COLONEL.    Of course! (_Exit_ SENDEN.) The election day is unendurable! In no  fight in my life did I have this feeling of fear. It is a mean  cannon-fever of which any ensign might be ashamed. And it is a long  time since I was an ensign!    [_Stamping his foot_.]    Confound it!    [_Goes to rear of stage_.]    IDA (_coming forward with_ ADELAIDE).    This uncertainty is frightful. Only one thing is sure, I shall be  unhappy whichever way this election turns out.    [_Leans on_ ADELAIDE.]    ADELAIDE.    Courage! Courage, little girl! Things may still turn out all right.  Hide your anxiety from your father; he is in a state of mind, as it  is, that does not please me at all.    _Enter_ BLUMENBERG _in haste; the_ COLONEL _rushes toward him_.    COLONEL.    Now, sir, how do things stand?    BLUMENBERG.    41 votes for you, Colonel, 34 for our opponents; three have fallen on  outsiders. The votes are being registered at very long intervals now,  but the difference in your favor remains much the same. Eight more  votes for you, Colonel, and the victory is won. We have every chance  now of coming out ahead. I am hurrying back, the decisive moment is at  hand. My compliments to the ladies!    [_Exit_.]    COLONEL.    Ida!    [IDA _hastens to him_.]    Are you my good daughter?    IDA.    My dear father!    COLONEL.    I know what is troubling you, child. You are worse off than any one.  Console yourself, Ida; if, as seems likely, the professor has to make  way for the old soldier, then we'll talk further on the matter.  Oldendorf has not deserved it of me; there are many things about him  that I do not like. But you are my only child. I shall think of that  and of nothing else; but the very first thing to do is to break down  the young man's obstinacy.    [_Releases_ IDA; _walks up and down again._]    ADELAIDE (_in the foreground, aside_).    The barometer has risen, the sunshine of pardon breaks through the  clouds. If only it were all over! Such excitement is infectious! (_To_  IDA.) You see you do not yet have to think of entering a nunnery.    IDA. But if Oldendorf is defeated, how will he bear it!    ADELAIDE (_shrugging her shoulders_).    He loses a seat in unpleasant company and wins, instead, an amusing  little wife. I think he ought to be satisfied. In any case he will  have a chance to make his speeches. Whether he makes them in one house  or another, what is the difference? I fancy you will listen to him  more reverently than any other member.    IDA (_shyly_).    But Adelaide, what if it really would be better for the country to  have Oldendorf elected?    ADELAIDE.    Yes, dearest, in that case there is no help for the country. Our State  and the rest of the European nations must learn to get along without  the professor. You have yourself to attend to first of all; you wish  to marry him; you come first.    [_Enter_ CARL.]    What news, Carl?    CARL.    Mr. von Senden presents his compliments and reports 47 to 42. The head  of the election committee, he says, has already congratulated him.    COLONEL.    Congratulated? Lay out my uniform, ask for the key of the wine-cellar,  and set the table; we are likely to have visitors this evening.    CARL.    Yes, Colonel.    [_Exit_.]    COLONEL (_to himself in the foreground_).    Now, my young professor! My style does not please you? It may be that  you are right. I grant you are a better journalist. But here, where it  is a serious matter, you will find yourself in the wrong, just for  once. [_Pause_.] I may be obliged to say a few words this evening. It  used to be said of me in the regiment, indeed, that I could always  speak to the point, but these manoeuvres in civilian dress disconcert  me a little. Let's think it over! It will be only proper for me to  mention Oldendorf in my speech, of course with due respect and  appreciation; yes indeed, I must do that. He is an honest fellow, with  an excellent heart, and a scholar with fine judgment. And he can be  very amiable if you disregard his political theories. We have had  pleasant evenings together. And as we sat then around my fat  tea-kettle and the good boy began to tell his stories, Ida's eyes  would be fixed on his face and would shine with pleasure--yes, and my  own old eyes, too, I think. Those were fine evenings! Why do we have  them no longer? Bah! They'll come back again! He'll bear defeat  quietly in his own way--a good, helpful way. No sensitiveness in him!  He really is at heart a fine fellow, and Ida and I could be happy with  him. And so, gentlemen and electors--but thunder and lightning! I  can't say all that to the voters! I'll say to them--    _Enter_ SENDEN.    SENDEN (_excitedly_).    Shameful, shameful! All is lost!    COLONEL.    Aha! (_Instantly draws himself up in military posture_.)        ADELAIDE }                      My presentiment! Father!             }                        [_Hurries to him_].             } (_together_).             }    IDA      }                      Dear me!      SENDEN.    It was going splendidly. We had 47, the opponents 42 votes. Eight  votes were still to be cast. Two more for us and the day would have  been ours. The legally appointed moment for closing the ballot-box had  come. All looked at the clock and called for the dilatory voters. Then  there was a trampling of feet in the corridor. A group of eight  persons pushed noisily into the hall, at their head the vulgar  wine-merchant Piepenbrink, the same one who at the fete the other  day--    ADELAIDE.    We know; go on--    SENDEN.    Each of the band in turn came forward, gave his vote and \"Edward  Oldendorf\" issued from the lips of all. Then finally came this  Piepenbrink. Before voting he asked the man next to him: \"Is the  professor sure of it?\" \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"Then I, as last voter,  choose as member of Parliament\"--[_Stops._]    ADELAIDE.    The professor?    SENDEN.    No. \"A most clever and cunning politician,\" so he put it, \"Dr. Conrad  Bolz.\" Then he turned short around and his henchmen followed him.    ADELAIDE (_aside, smiling_).    Aha!    SENDEN.    Oldendorf is member by a majority of two votes.    COLONEL.    Ugh!    SENDEN.    It is a shame! No one is to blame for this result but these  journalists of the _Union_. Such a running about, an intriguing, a  shaking of hands with all the voters, a praising of this Oldendorf, a  shrugging of the shoulders at us--and at you, dear Sir!    COLONEL.    Indeed?    IDA.    That last is not true."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14472"],[0,"Showell's Dictionary of Birmingham (#13)"],[1,"money before he obtained  permission to do so. In clearing the old streets away to make room for  New Street Station, in 1846, the London and North Western found a small  Jewish Cemetery in what was then known as the \"Froggery,\" but which had  long been disused. The descendants of Israel carefully gathered the  bones and reinterred them in their later-dated cemetery in Granville  Street, but even here they did not find their last resting-place, for  when, a few years back, the Midland made the West Suburban line, it  became necessary to clear out this ground also, and the much-disturbed  remains of the poor Hebrews were removed to Witton. The third and last  of the Jewish Cemeteries, that in Betholom Row, which was first used in  or about 1825, and has long been full, is also doomed to make way for  the extension of the same line.--During the year 1883 the time-honoured  old Meeting-house yard, where Poet Freeth, and many another local  worthy, were laid to rest, has been carted off--dust and ashes, tombs  and tombstones--to the great graveyard at Witton, where Christian and  Infidel, Jew and Gentile, it is to be hoped, will be left at peace till  the end of the world.    In 1860, the Corporation purchased 105 acres of land at Witton for the  Borough Cemetery. The foundation stones of two chapels were laid August  12, 1861, and the Cemetery was opened May 27, 1863, the total cost being  nearly L40,000. Of the 105 acres, 53 are consecrated to the use of the  Church of England, 35 laid out for Dissenters, and 14 set aside for  Catholics and Jews.    ~Census.~--The numbering of the people by a regular and systematic plan  once in every ten years, only came into operation in 1801, and the most  interesting returns, as connected with this town and its immediate  neighbourhood, will be found under the heading of \"_Population_.\"    ~Centre of Birmingham.~--As defined by the authorities for the  settlement of any question of distance, Attwood's statue at the top of  Stephenson Place, in New Street, is reckoned as the central spot of the  borough. In olden days, Nelson's monument, and prior to that, the Old  Cross, in the Bull Ring, was taken as the centre. As an absolute matter  of fact, so far as the irregular shape of the borough area will allow of  such a measurement being made, the central spot is covered by Messrs.  Harris and Norton's warehouse in Corporation Street.    ~Centenarians.~--John Harman, better known as Bishop Vesey, died in  1555, in his 103rd year. James Sands, who died at Harborne in 1625, was  said to have been 140 years old, and his wife lived to be 120. Joseph  Stanley, of Aston, died in May, 1761, in his 106th year. Wesley, under  date of March 19, 1768, wrote of having seen George Bridgens, then in  his 107th year; Hutton, in noticing the long life of Bridgens, also  mentions one John Pitt who lived to be 100, a Mrs. Moore who reached  104, and an old market man who completed his 107th year. A Mr. Clarkson  died here, in February, 1733, aged 112. William Jennens, _the_ Jennens  of untold, but much coveted, wealth, died in June, 1798, aged 103. John  Roberts, of Digbeth, had a family of twenty-eight children, six by his  third wife, whom he married when nearly eighty, and lived to see his  103rd year, in 1792, dying July 6. Thomas Taylor, a cobbler, stuck to  his last until a week of his death, July 8, 1796, at 103. T. Blakemore  died November 12, 1837, aged 105. Mrs. E. Bailey, founder of the Female  Charity School, was also 105 at her death, December 2, 1854. Another old  lady was Elizabeth Taylor, who died at Sparkbrook, March 5, 1864, aged  104 years. Mary Hemming, of Moseley Wake Green, died December 5, 1881,  in her 104th year.    ~Centenary Celebrations~, more or less worthy of note, are continuously  recurring, and the date of some few are here preserved. Our loyal  grandfathers honoured the hundredth, anniversary of the Revolution of  1688, by a public dinner, November 4, 1788. Old Bluecoat boys in like  manner kept the centenary of their school, August 24, 1824. Admirers of  the Philosopher Priestley chose All Fools' Day, 1831, as the fitting day  to celebrate the anniversary of his birth. The Centenary of the  Protestant Dissenting Charity Schools was worthily celebrated by the  raising of a special sum amounting to L1,305, as an addition to the  funds. In January, 1859, Robert Burns' anniversary was remembered by the  holding a supper in Aston Hall, at which only half-a-dozen Scotchmen  were present out of half-a-hundred guests. The Dissenting Ministers of  this and the neighbouring counties, who, for a hundred years, have met  together once a month, celebrated the event by a quiet luncheon-dinner,  December 13, 1882. The Tercentenary of the Free Grammar School was  celebrated with learned speeches April 16, 1852; that of Good Queen  Bess, by a public prayer meeting, November 16, 1858; and that of  Shakespeare, April 23, 1864, by the founding of a Shakespeare Memorial  Library. The thousandth anniversary of Alfred the Great, October 29,  1849, was made much of by the Political Knowledge Association, which had  not been in existence it thousand days. The fact of John Bright being  M.P. for Birmingham for a quarter of a century, was celebrated in June,  1883, by the Liberal Association, who got up a \"monster\" procession in  imitation of the celebrated Attwood procession of the old days of  Reform. The holiday was most thoroughly enjoyed by the public generally,  and immense numbers of people thronged the streets to hear the bands and  see what was to be seen.    ~Chamberlain Memorial.~--See \"_Statues_,\" &c.    ~Chamber of Commerce.~--In 1783 there was a \"Standing General Commercial  Committee,\" composed of the leading merchants and Manufacturers, who  undertook the duty of looking after the public interests of the town  (not forgetting their own peculiarly private ditto). That they were not  so Liberal as their compeers of to-day may be gathered from the fact of  their strongly opposing the exportation of brass, and on no account  permitting a workman to go abroad.    ~Chamber of Manufacturers.~--When Pitt, in 1784, proposed to tax coal,  iron, copper, and other raw materials, he encountered a strong  opposition from the manufacturers, prominent among whom were Boulton  (Soho), Wilkinson (Bradley), and Wedgwood (Potteries), who formed a  \"Chamber,\" the first meeting of which was held here in February, 1785.  The Minister was induced to alter his mind.    ~Chandeliers.~--Many beautiful works of art have been manufactured in  this town, which, though the wonder and admiration of strangers, receive  but faint notice here, and find no record except in the newspaper of the  day or a work like the present. Among such may be ranked the superb  brass chandelier which Mr. R.W. Winfield sent to Osborne in 1853 for Her  Majesty, the Queen. Designed in the Italian style, this fine specimen of  the brassworkers' skill, relieved by burnishing and light matted work,  ornamented with figures of Peace, Plenty, and Love in purest Parian,  masks of female faces typical of night, and otherwise decorated in the  richest manner, was declared by the late Prince Consort as the finest  work he had ever seen made in this country and worthy to rank with that  of the masters of old. Not so fortunate was Mr. Collis with the  \"Clarence chandelier\" and sideboard he exhibited at the Exhibition of  1862. Originally made of the richest ruby cut and gilded glass for  William IV., it was not finished before that monarch's death, and was  left on the maker's hand. Its cost was nearly L1,000, but at the final  sale of Mr. Collis's effects in Dec. 1881 it was sold for L5.    ~Chapels and Churches.~--See \"_Places of Worship_.\"    ~Charity.~--Charitable collections were made in this neighbourhood in  1655, for the Redmontese Protestants, Birmingham giving L15 11s. 2d.,  Sutton Coldfield L14, and Aston L4 14s. 2d. On the 6th of June, 1690,  L13 18s. 1-1/2d. were collected at St. Martin's \"for ye Irish  Protestants.\" In 1764 some Christmas performances were given for the  relief of aged and distressed housekeepers, and the charitable custom  thus inaugurated was kept up for over seventy years. In the days of  monks and monasteries, the poor and needy, the halt and lame, received  charitable doles at the hands of the former and at the gates of the  latter, but it would be questionable how far the liberality of the  parsons, priests, and preachers of the present day would go were the  same system now in vogue. It has been estimated that nearly L5,000 is  given every year in what may be called the indiscriminate charity of  giving alms to those who ask it in the streets or from door to door. By  far the largest portion of this amount goes into the hands of the  undeserving and the worthless, and the formation of a central relief  office, into which the charitably-disposed may hand in their  contributions, and from whence the really poor and deserving may receive  help in times of distress, has been a long felt want. In 1869 a \"Charity  Organisation Society\" was established here, and it is still in  existence, but it does not appear to meet with that recognised support  which such an institution as suggested requires. In 1882 a special fund  was started for the purpose of giving aid to women left with children,  and about L380 was subscribed thereto, while the ordinary income was  only L680. The special fund can hardly be said as yet to have got into  working order, but when the cost of proving the property of the  recipients, with the necessary expenses of office rent, salaries, &c.,  have been deducted from the ordinary income, the amount left to be  distributed among the persons deemed by the officials deserving of  assistance is small indeed, the expenses reaching about L330 per year.  In 1880 it cost L329 18s. 4d. to give away food, cash, and clothing,  &c., valued at L386 16s. 6d., an apparent anomally which would not"]]]
