Hume must have agreed with those  thoughts, he was already taking long strides back to the cliff  entrance.    But that door was closed. Hume's foot, raised for the last step toward  the crevice corridor, struck an invisible obstruction. He reeled back,  clutching at Vye's shoulder.    \"Something's there!\"    The younger man put out his hand questingly. What his fingers  flattened against was not a tight, solid surface, but rather an unseen  elastic curtain which gave a little under his prodding and then drew  taut again.    Together they explored by touch what they could not see. The crevice  through which they had entered was now closed with a curtain they  could not pierce or break. Hume tried his ray tube. They watched thin  flame run up and down that invisible barrier, but not destroy it.    Hume relooped the tube. \"Their trap is sprung.\"    \"There may be another way out!\" But Vye was already despondently sure  there was not. Those who had rigged this trap would leave no bolt  holes. But because they were human and refused to accept the  inevitable without a fight, the captives set off, not down into the  curve of the cup, but along its slope.    Tongues of brush and tree clumps brought about detours which forced  them slowly downward. They were well away from the crevice when Hume  halted, flung up a hand in silent warning. Vye listened, trying to  pick up the sound which had alarmed his companion.    It was as Vye strained to catch a betraying noise that he was first  conscious of what he did not hear. In the plains there had been  squeaking, humming, chitterings, the vocalizing of myriad grass  dwellers. Here, except for the sighing of the wind and a few insect  sounds--nothing. All inhabitants bigger than a Jumalan fly might have  long ago been routed out of the land.    \"To the left.\" Hume faced about.    There was a heavy thicket there, too stoutly grown for anything to be  within its shadow. Whatever moved must be behind it.    Vye looked about him frantically for anything he could use as a  weapon. Then he grabbed at the long bush knife in Hume's belt sheath.  Eighteen inches of tri-fold steel gleamed wickedly, its hilt fitting  neatly into his fist as he held it point up, ready.    Hume advanced on the bush in small steps, and Vye circled to his left  a few paces behind. The Hunter was an expert with ray tube; that, too,  was part of the necessary skill of a safari leader. But Vye could  offer other help.    He shrugged out of the blanket pack he had been carrying on his back,  tossed that burden ahead.    Out of cover charged a streak of red, to land on the bait. Hume  blasted, was answered by a water-cat's high-pitched scream. The feline  writhed out of its life in a stench of scorched fur and flesh. As Vye  retrieved his clawed pack Hume stood over the dead animal.    \"Odd.\" He reached down to grasp a still twitching foreleg, stretched  the body out with a sudden jerk.    It was a giant of its species, a male, larger than any he had seen.  But a second look showed him those ribs starting through mangy fur in  visible hoops, the skin tight over the skull, far too tight. The  water-cat had been close to death by starvation; its attack on the men  probably had been sparked by sheer desperation. A starving carnivore  in a land lacking the normal sounds of small birds and animal life, in  a valley used as a trap.    \"No way out and no food.\" Vye fitted one thought to another out loud.    \"Yes. Pin the enemy up, let them finish off one another.\"    \"But why?\" Vye demanded.    \"Least trouble that way.\"    \"There are plenty of water-cats down on the plains. All of them  couldn't be herded up here to finish each other off; it would take  years--centuries.\"    \"This one's capture may have been only incidental, or done for the  purpose of keeping some type of machinery in working order,\" Hume  replied. \"I don't believe this was arranged just to dispose of  water-cats.\"    \"Suppose this was started a long time ago, and those who did it are  gone, so now it goes on working without any real intelligence behind  it. That could be the answer, couldn't it?\"    \"Some process triggers into action when a ship sets down on this  portion of Jumala, maybe when one planet's under certain conditions  only? Yes, that makes sense. Only why wasn't the first Patrol explorer  flaming in here caught? And the survey team--we were here for months,  cataloguing, mapping, not a whisper of any such trouble.\"    \"That dead man--he's been here a long time. And when did the Largo  Drift disappear?\"    \"Five--six years ago. But I can't give you any answers. I have none.\"           *       *       *       *       *    It began as a low hum, hardly to be distinguished from the distant  howling of the wind. Then it slid up scale until the thin wail became  an ululating scream torturing the ears, dragging out of hiding those  fears of a man confronting the unknown in the dark.    Hume tugged at Vye, drew the other by force back into the brush.  Scratched, laced raw by the whip of branches, they stood in a small  hollow with the drift of leaves high about their ankles. And the  Hunter pulled into place the portions of growth they had dislodged in  their passage into the thicket's heart. Through gaps they could see  the opening where lay the body of the water-cat.    The wail was cut off short, that cessation in itself a warning. Vye's  body, touching earth with knee and hand as he crouched, picked up a  vibration. Whatever came towards them walked heavily.    Did the smell of death draw it now? Or had it trailed them from the  closed gate? Hume's breath hissed lightly between his teeth. He was  sighting the ray tube through a leaf gap.    A snuffling, heavier than a man's panting. A vast blot, which was  neither clearly paw nor hand, swept aside leaves and branches on the  other side of the small clearing, tearing them casually from the  shrubs.    What shuffled into the open might be a cousin of the blue beasts. But  where they had given only an impression of brutal menace, this was  savagery incarnate. Taller than Hume, but hunched forward in its  neckless outline, the thing was a monster. And over the round of the  lower jaw, tusks protruded in ugly promise.    Being carnivorous and hungry, it scooped up the body of the water-cat  and fed without any prolonged ceremony. Vye, remembering the crushed  spine of the human skeleton, was sickened.    Done, it reared on hind feet once again, the pear-shaped head swung in  their direction. Vye was half certain he had seen that tube-nose  expand to test the air and scent them.    Hume pressed the button of the ray tube. That soundless spear of death  struck in midsection of that barrel body. The thing howled, threw  itself in a mad forward rush at their bush. Hume snapped a second  blast at the head, and the fuzz covering it blackened.    Missing them by a precious foot, the creature crashed straight on  through the thicket, coming to its knees, writhing in a rising chorus  of howls. The men broke out of cover, raced into the open where they  took refuge behind a chimney of rock half detached from the parent  cliff. Down the slope the bushes were still wildly agitated.    \"What was that?\" Vye got out between sobbing breaths.    \"Maybe a guardian, or a patrol stationed to dispose of any catch.  Probably not alone, either.\" Hume fingered his ray tube. \"And I am  down to one full charge--just one.\"    Vye turned the knife he held around in his fingers, tried to imagine  how one could face up to one of those tusked monsters with only this  for a weapon. But if that thing had companions, none were coming in  answer to its dying wails. And after it had been quiet for a while  Hume motioned them out of hiding.    \"From now on we'll keep to the open, better see trouble like that  before it arrives. And I want to find a place to hole up for the  night.\"    They trailed along the steep upper slope and in time found a place  where a now dried stream had once formed a falls. The empty  watercourse provided an overhang, not quite a cave, but shelter.  Gathering brush and stones, they made a barricade and settled behind  it to eat sparingly of their rations.    \"Water--a whole lake of it down there. The worst of it is that a water  supply in a dry country is just where hunters congregate. That lake's  entirely walled in by woodland and provides cover for a thousand  ambushes.\"    \"We might find a way out before our water bulbs fail,\" Vye offered.    Hume did not answer directly. \"A man can live for quite a while on  very thin rations, and we have tablets from the flitter emergency  supplies. But he can't live long without water. We have two bulbs.  With stretching that is enough for two days--maybe three.\"    \"We ought to get completely around the cliffs in another day.\"    \"And if we do find a way out, which I doubt, we're still going to need  water for the trek out. It's right down there waiting until our need  is greater than either our fear or our cunning.\"    Vye moved impatiently, his blanket-clad shoulders scraping the rock at  their backs. \"You don't think we have a chance!\"    \"We aren't dead. And as long as a man is breathing, and on his feet,  with all his wits in his skull, he always has a chance. I've blasted  off-world with odds stacked high on the other side of the board.\" He  flexed that plasta-flesh hand which was so nearly human and yet not by  the fraction which had changed the course of his life. \"I've lived on  the edge of the big blackout for a long time now--after a while you  can get used to anything.\"    \"One thing I would like--to get at the one who set this trap,\"  commented Vye.    Hume laughed with dry humor. \"After me, boy, after me. But I think we  might have to wait a long time for that meeting.\"          10      Vye crawled weakly from the area of a rock outcrop. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19098"],[0,"Christmas in Ritual and Tradition, Christian and Pagan (#13)"],[1,"Christian looks forward  with mingled hope and awe. There are four weeks in Advent, and an ancient  symbolical explanation interprets these as typifying four comings of the  Son of God: the first in the flesh, the second in the hearts of the  faithful through the Holy Spirit, the third at the death of every man,  and the fourth at the Judgment Day. The fourth week is never completed  (Christmas Eve is regarded as not part of Advent), because the glory  bestowed on the saints at the Last Coming will never end.    The great Eucharistic hymn, \"Gloria in excelsis,\" is omitted in Advent,  in order, say the symbolists, that on Christmas night, when it was first  sung by the angels, it may be chanted with the greater eagerness and  devotion. The \"Te Deum\" at Matins too is left unsaid, because Christ is  regarded as not yet come. But \"Alleluia\" is not omitted, because Advent  is only half a time of penitence: there is awe at the thought of the  Coming for Judgment, but joy also in the hope of the Incarnation to be  celebrated at Christmas, and the glory in store for the faithful.{3}    Looking forward is above all things the note of Advent; the Church seeks  to share the mood of the Old Testament saints, and she draws more now  than at any other season, perhaps, on the treasures of Hebrew prophecy  for her lessons, antiphons, versicles, and responds. Looking for the  glory that shall be revealed, she awaits, at this darkest time of the  year, the rising |92| of the Sun of Righteousness. _Rorate, coeli,  desuper_--the mood comes at times to all idealists, and even those  moderns who hope not for a supernatural Redeemer, but for the triumph of  social justice on this earth, must be stirred by the poetry of the Advent  offices.    It is at Vespers on the seven days before Christmas Eve that the Church's  longing finds its noblest expression--in the antiphons known as the  \"Great O's,\" sung before and after the \"Magnificat,\" one on each day. \"O  Sapientia,\" runs the first, \"O Wisdom, which camest out of the mouth of  the Most High, and reachest from one end to another, mightily and sweetly  ordering all things: come and teach us the way of prudence.\" \"O Adonai,\"  \"O Root of Jesse,\" \"O Key of David,\" \"O Day-spring, Brightness of Light  Everlasting,\" \"O King of the Nations,\" thus the Church calls to her Lord,  \"O Emmanuel, our King and Lawgiver, the Desire of all nations, and their  Salvation: come and save us, O Lord our God.\"{4}    At last Christmas Eve is here, and at Vespers we feel the nearness of the  great Coming. \"Lift up your heads: behold your redemption draweth nigh,\"  is the antiphon for the last psalm. \"To-morrow shall be done away the  iniquity of the earth,\" is the versicle after the Office Hymn. And before  and after the \"Magnificat\" the Church sings: \"When the sun shall have  risen, ye shall see the King of kings coming forth from the Father, as a  bridegroom out of his chamber.\"    Yet only with the night office of Matins does the glory of the festival  begin. There is a special fitness at Christmas in the Church's keeping  watch by night, like the shepherds of Bethlehem, and the office is full  of the poetry of the season, full of exultant joy. To the \"Venite,  exultemus Domino\" a Christmas note is added by the oft-repeated  Invitatory, \"Unto us the Christ is born: O come, let us adore Him.\"  Psalms follow--among them the three retained by the Anglican Church in  her Christmas Matins--and lessons from the Old and New Testaments and the  homilies of the Fathers, interspersed with Responsories bringing home to  the faithful the wonders of the Holy Night. Some are almost dramatic;  this, for instance:-- |93|     \"Whom saw ye, O shepherds? speak; tell us who hath appeared on the earth.    We saw the new-born Child, and angels singing praise unto the Lord.    Speak, what saw ye? and tell us of the birth of Christ.    We saw the new-born Child, and angels singing praise unto the Lord.\"    It is the wonder of the Incarnation, the marvel of the spotless Birth,  the song of the Angels, the coming down from heaven of true peace, the  daybreak of redemption and everlasting joy, the glory of the  Only-begotten, now beheld by men--the supernatural side, in fact, of the  festival, that the Church sets forth in her radiant words; there is  little thought of the purely human side, the pathos of Bethlehem.    It was customary at certain places, in mediaeval times, to lay on the  altar three veils, and remove one at each nocturn of Christmas Matins.  The first was black, and symbolised the time of darkness before the  Mosaic Law; the second white, typifying, it would seem, the faith of  those who lived under that Law of partial revelation; the third red,  showing the love of Christ's bride, the Church, in the time of grace  flowing from the Incarnation.{5}    A stately ceremony took place in England in the Middle Ages at the end of  Christmas Matins--the chanting of St. Matthew's genealogy of Christ. The  deacon, in his dalmatic, with acolytes carrying tapers, with thurifer and  cross-bearer, all in albs and unicles, went in procession to the pulpit  or the rood-loft, to sing this portion of the Gospel. If the bishop were  present, he it was who chanted it, and a rich candlestick was held to  light him.[36] Then followed the chanting of the \"Te Deum.\"{6} The  ceremony does not appear in the ordinary Roman books, but it is still  performed by the Benedictines, as one may read in the striking account of  the monastic Christmas given by Huysmans in \"L'Oblat.\"{7}    |94| Where, as in religious communities, the offices of the Church are  performed in their full order, there follows on Matins that custom  peculiar to Christmas, the celebration of Midnight Mass. On Christmas  morning every priest is permitted to say three Masses, which should in  strictness be celebrated at midnight, at dawn, and in full daylight. Each  has its own Collect, Epistle, and Gospel, each its own Introit, Gradual,  and other anthems. In many countries the Midnight Mass is the distinctive  Christmas service, a great and unique event in the year, something which  by its strangeness gives to the feast of the Nativity a place by itself.  Few Catholic rites are more impressive than this Midnight Mass,  especially in country places; through the darkness and cold of the  winter's night, often for long distances, the faithful journey to worship  the Infant Saviour in the splendour of the lighted church. It is a  re-enactment of the visit of the shepherds to the cave at Bethlehem,  aglow with supernatural light.    Various symbolical explanations of the three Masses were given by  mediaeval writers. The midnight celebration was supposed to represent  mankind's condition before the Law of Moses, when thick darkness covered  the earth; the second, at dawn, the time of the Law and the Prophets with  its growing light; the third, in full daylight, the Christian era of  light and grace. Another interpretation, adopted by St. Thomas Aquinas,  is more mystical; the three Masses stand for the threefold birth of  Christ, the first typifying the dark mystery of the eternal generation of  the Son, the second the birth of Christ the morning-star within the  hearts of men, the third the bodily birth of the Son of Mary.{8}    At the Christmas Masses the \"Gloria in excelsis\" resounds again. This  song of the angels was at first chanted only at Christmas; it was  introduced into Rome during the fifth century at Midnight Mass in  imitation of the custom of the Church of Jerusalem.{9}    It is, indeed, from imitation of the services at Jerusalem and Bethlehem  that the three Roman Masses of Christmas seem to have sprung. From a late  fourth-century document known as |95| the \"Peregrinatio Silviae,\" the  narrative of a pilgrimage to the holy places of the east by a great lady  from southern Gaul, it appears that at the feast of the Epiphany--when  the Birth of Christ was commemorated in the Palestinian Church--two  successive \"stations\" were held, one at Bethlehem, the other at  Jerusalem. At Bethlehem the station was held at night on the eve of the  feast, then a procession was made to the church of the Anastasis or  Resurrection--where was the Holy Sepulchre--arriving \"about the hour when  one man begins to recognise another, _i.e._, near daylight, but before  the day has fully broken.\" There a psalm was sung, prayers were said, and  the catechumens and faithful were blessed by the bishop. Later, Mass was  celebrated at the Great Church at Golgotha, and the procession returned  to the Anastasis, where another Mass was said.{10}    At Bethlehem at the present time impressive services are held on the  Latin Christmas Day. The Patriarch comes from Jerusalem, with a troop of  cavalry and Kavasses in gorgeous array. The office lasts from 10 o'clock  on Christmas Eve until long after midnight. \"At the reading of the Gospel  the clergy and as many of the congregation as can follow leave the  church, and proceed by a flight of steps and a tortuous rock-hewn passage  to the Grotto of the Nativity, an irregular subterranean chamber, long  and narrow. They carry with them a waxen image of an infant--the  _bambino_--wrap it in swaddling bands and lay it on the site which is  said to be that of the manger.\"{11}    The Midnight Mass appears to have been introduced into Rome in the first  half of the fifth century. It was celebrated by the Pope in the church of  Santa Maria Maggiore, while the second Mass was sung by him at Sant'  Anastasia--perhaps because of the resemblance of the name to the  Anastasis at Jerusalem--and the third at St. Peter's.{12} On Christmas  Eve the Pope held a solemn \"station\" at Santa Maria Maggiore, and two  Vespers were sung, the first very simple, the second, at which the Pope  pontificated, with elaborate ceremonial. Before the second Vespers, in  the twelfth century, a good meal had to |96| be prepared for the papal  household by the Cardinal-Bishop of"]]]
