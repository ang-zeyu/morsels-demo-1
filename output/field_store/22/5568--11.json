When he was gone, Arbaces, drawing his seat nearer to the fair  Neapolitan's, said in those bland and subdued tones, in which he knew so  well how to veil the mingled art and fierceness of his character:    'Think not, my sweet pupil, if so I may call you, that I wish to shackle  that liberty you adorn while you assume: but which, if not greater, as  you rightly observe, than that possessed by the Roman women, must at  least be accompanied by great circumspection, when arrogated by one  unmarried. Continue to draw crowds of the gay, the brilliant, the wise  themselves, to your feet--continue to charm them with the conversation  of an Aspasia, the music of an Erinna--but reflect, at least, on those  censorious tongues which can so easily blight the tender reputation of a  maiden; and while you provoke admiration, give, I beseech you, no  victory to envy.'    'What mean you, Arbaces?' said Ione, in an alarmed and trembling voice:  'I know you are my friend, that you desire only my honour and my  welfare.  What is it you would say?'    'Your friend--ah, how sincerely!  May I speak then as a friend, without  reserve and without offence?'    'I beseech you do so.'    'This young profligate, this Glaucus, how didst thou know him? Hast thou  seen him often?' And as Arbaces spoke, he fixed his gaze steadfastly  upon Ione, as if he sought to penetrate into her soul.    Recoiling before that gaze, with a strange fear which she could not  explain, the Neapolitan answered with confusion and hesitation: 'He was  brought to my house as a countryman of my father's, and I may say of  mine.  I have known him only within this last week or so: but why these  questions?'    'Forgive me,' said Arbaces; 'I thought you might have known him longer.  Base insinuator that he is!'    'How! what mean you?  Why that term?'    'It matters not: let me not rouse your indignation against one who does  not deserve so grave an honour.'    'I implore you speak.  What has Glaucus insinuated? or rather, in what  do you suppose he has offended?'    Smothering his resentment at the last part of Ione's question, Arbaces  continued: 'You know his pursuits, his companions his habits; the  comissatio and the alea (the revel and the dice) make his occupation;  and amongst the associates of vice how can he dream of virtue?'    'Still you speak riddles.  By the gods!  I entreat you, say the worst at  once.'    'Well, then, it must be so.  Know, my Ione, that it was but yesterday  that Glaucus boasted openly--yes, in the public baths--of your love to  him.  He said it amused him to take advantage of it. Nay, I will do him  justice, he praised your beauty.  Who could deny it? But he laughed  scornfully when his Clodius, or his Lepidus, asked him if he loved you  enough for marriage, and when he purposed to adorn his door-posts with  flowers?'    'Impossible!  How heard you this base slander?'    'Nay, would you have me relate to you all the comments of the insolent  coxcombs with which the story has circled through the town? Be assured  that I myself disbelieved at first, and that I have now painfully been  convinced by several ear-witnesses of the truth of what I have  reluctantly told thee.'    Ione sank back, and her face was whiter than the pillar against which  she leaned for support.    'I own it vexed--it irritated me, to hear your name thus lightly pitched  from lip to lip, like some mere dancing-girl's fame.  I hastened this  morning to seek and to warn you.  I found Glaucus here.  I was stung  from my self-possession.  I could not conceal my feelings; nay, I was  uncourteous in thy presence.  Canst thou forgive thy friend, Ione?'    Ione placed her hand in his, but replied not.    'Think no more of this,' said he; 'but let it be a warning voice, to  tell thee how much prudence thy lot requires.  It cannot hurt thee,  Ione, for a moment; for a gay thing like this could never have been  honored by even a serious thought from Ione.  These insults only wound  when they come from one we love; far different indeed is he whom the  lofty Ione shall stoop to love.'    'Love!' muttered Ione, with an hysterical laugh.  'Ay, indeed.'    It is not without interest to observe in those remote times, and under a  social system so widely different from the modern, the same small causes  that ruffle and interrupt the 'course of love', which operate so  commonly at this day--the same inventive jealousy, the same cunning  slander, the same crafty and fabricated retailings of petty gossip,  which so often now suffice to break the ties of the truest love, and  counteract the tenor of circumstances most apparently propitious.  When  the bark sails on over the smoothest wave, the fable tells us of the  diminutive fish that can cling to the keel and arrest its progress: so  is it ever with the great passions of mankind; and we should paint life  but ill if, even in times the most prodigal of romance, and of the  romance of which we most largely avail ourselves, we did not also  describe the mechanism of those trivial and household springs of  mischief which we see every day at work in our chambers and at our  hearths.  It is in these, the lesser intrigues of life, that we mostly  find ourselves at home with the past.    Most cunningly had the Egyptian appealed to Ione's ruling foible--most  dexterously had he applied the poisoned dart to her pride.  He fancied  he had arrested what he hoped, from the shortness of the time she had  known Glaucus, was, at most, but an incipient fancy; and hastening to  change the subject, he now led her to talk of her brother.  Their  conversation did not last long.  He left her, resolved not again to  trust so much to absence, but to visit--to watch her--every day.    No sooner had his shadow glided from her presence, than woman's  pride--her sex's dissimulation--deserted his intended victim, and the  haughty Ione burst into passionate tears.        Chapter VII    THE GAY LIFE OF THE POMPEIAN LOUNGER.  A MINIATURE LIKENESS OF THE ROMAN  BATHS.    WHEN Glaucus left Ione, he felt as if he trod upon air.  In the  interview with which he had just been blessed, he had for the first time  gathered from her distinctly that his love was not unwelcome to, and  would not be unrewarded by, her.  This hope filled him with a rapture  for which earth and heaven seemed too narrow to afford a vent.  Unconscious of the sudden enemy he had left behind, and forgetting not  only his taunts but his very existence, Glaucus passed through the gay  streets, repeating to himself, in the wantonness of joy, the music of  the soft air to which Ione had listened with such intentness; and now he  entered the Street of Fortune, with its raised footpath--its houses  painted without, and the open doors admitting the view of the glowing  frescoes within.  Each end of the street was adorned with a triumphal  arch: and as Glaucus now came before the Temple of Fortune, the jutting  portico of that beautiful fane (which is supposed to have been built by  one of the family of Cicero, perhaps by the orator himself) imparted a  dignified and venerable feature to a scene otherwise more brilliant than  lofty in its character.  That temple was one of the most graceful  specimens of Roman architecture. It was raised on a somewhat lofty  podium; and between two flights of steps ascending to a platform stood  the altar of the goddess.  From this platform another flight of broad  stairs led to the portico, from the height of whose fluted columns hung  festoons of the richest flowers.  On either side the extremities of the  temple were placed statues of Grecian workmanship; and at a little  distance from the temple rose the triumphal arch crowned with an  equestrian statue of Caligula, which was flanked by trophies of bronze.  In the space before the temple a lively throng were assembled--some  seated on benches and discussing the politics of the empire, some  conversing on the approaching spectacle of the amphitheatre.  One knot  of young men were lauding a new beauty, another discussing the merits of  the last play; a third group, more stricken in age, were speculating on  the chance of the trade with Alexandria, and amidst these were many  merchants in the Eastern costume, whose loose and peculiar robes,  painted and gemmed slippers, and composed and serious countenances,  formed a striking contrast to the tunicked forms and animated gestures  of the Italians.  For that impatient and lively people had, as now, a  language distinct from speech--a language of signs and motions,  inexpressibly significant and vivacious: their descendants retain it,  and the learned Jorio hath written a most entertaining work upon that  species of hieroglyphical gesticulation.    Sauntering through the crowd, Glaucus soon found himself amidst a group  of his merry and dissipated friends.    'Ah!' said Sallust, 'it is a lustrum since I saw you.'    'And how have you spent the lustrum?  What new dishes have you  discovered?'    'I have been scientific,' returned Sallust, 'and have made some  experiments in the feeding of lampreys: I confess I despair of bringing  them to the perfection which our Roman ancestors attained.'    'Miserable man! and why?'    'Because,' returned Sallust, with a sigh, 'it is no longer lawful to  give them a slave to eat.  I am very often tempted to make away with a  very fat carptor (butler) whom I possess, and pop him slily into the  reservoir.  He would give the fish a most oleaginous flavor!  But slaves  are not slaves nowadays, and have no sympathy with their masters'  interest--or Davus would destroy himself to oblige me!'    'What news from Rome?' said Lepidus, as he languidly joined the group.    'The emperor has been giving a splendid supper to the senators,'  answered Sallust.    'He is a good creature,' quoth Lepidus; 'they say he never sends a man  away without granting his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15659"],[0,"The Beacon Second Reader (#13)"],[1,"defend    dismiss    expose  inquire   endure    disturb    excuse  inclose   enlarge   forbid     express  inform    engrave   forgive    explain  intent    except    forget     require  insist    exchange  forsake    unwind  invite    explore   rebound    behind  inflame   exclaim   recess     unfold  remark    repeat    recite     reply  refer     repair    replace    recall  renew     regret    release    retain  rejoice   return    reduce     report  regard    refresh   restore    remain  coachman  huntsman  seaman     postman  salesman  workman   footman    hackman  railroad  birthday  foreman    boatman  inkstand  daylight  fireplace  teacup  seaside   seaweed   sunbeam    tiptoe  stairway  necktie   rainbow    railway  seashore  cobweb    spyglass   beehive      Usually the vowel followed by one consonant is given the long sound,  whereas, when the consonant is doubled, the vowel usually has the short  sound, as illustrated in the following words.    biter     plater   toper    hoping  bitter    platter  stopper  hopping  diner     shiny    tiny     doted  dinner    shinny   tinny    dotted  cuter     hater    poker    offer  cutter    hated    paper    wider  holy      hatter   taper    spider  holly     riding   favor    diver  bony      ridding  fever    gallon  bonny     biting   clover   racer  bogy      bitting  over     cider  boggy     caning   halo     label  Mary      canning  solo     yellow  marry     planer   polo     jolly  mate      planner  flabby   jelly  matter    ruder    shabby   maker  robed     rudder   ruddy    taker  robbed    loping   tulip    dummy  pining    lopping  cedar    common  pinning   baker    tamer    moment  tuning    shady    liner    silent  stunning  lady     pacer    ruby  planing   tidy     giddy    bonnet  planning  pony     sudden   penny      The following words illustrate silent _k_, _g_, _w_, _b_, _l_, _t_, and  _gh_.    knee     kneel     knelt     knell      knit  knife    knot      knock     knob       knew  knave    knead     know      knack      gnat  gnaw     gnu       gnash     gnarl      gnome  wry      wren      wrist     wrote      write  wrap     wring     wrung     wrong      wrest  wreck    wrath     wretch    wreak      wrench  writhe   wreath    high      sigh       wright  thigh    light     fight     tight      sight  knight   right     fright    plight     night  blight   slight    bright    flight     might  caught   naught    taught    daughter   aught  tightly  brightly  lightly   lightning  naughty  climb    comb      crumb     dumb       lamb  limb     numb      thumb     debt       doubt  combing  calf      half      balm       calm  chalk    stalk     walk      folks      talk  often    soften    castle    jostle     rustle  thistle  whistle   chestnut"]]]
