To prefer one in honor to another, to exalt certain ones above the  rest, is in no wise to be permitted. Every true Prophet hath regarded His  Message as fundamentally the same as the Revelation of every other Prophet  gone before Him. If any man, therefore, should fail to comprehend this  truth, and should consequently indulge in vain and unseemly language, no  one whose sight is keen and whose understanding is enlightened would ever  allow such idle talk to cause him to waver in his belief.    The measure of the revelation of the Prophets of God in this world,  however, must differ. Each and every one of them hath been the Bearer of a  distinct Message, and hath been commissioned to reveal Himself through  specific acts. It is for this reason that they appear to vary in their  greatness. Their Revelation may be likened unto the light of the moon that  sheddeth its radiance upon the earth. Though every time it appeareth, it  revealeth a fresh measure of its brightness, yet its inherent splendor can  never diminish, nor can its light suffer extinction.    It is clear and evident, therefore, that any apparent variation in the  intensity of their light is not inherent in the light itself, but should  rather be attributed to the varying receptivity of an ever-changing world.  Every Prophet Whom the Almighty and Peerless Creator hath purposed to send  to the peoples of the earth hath been entrusted with a Message, and  charged to act in a manner that would best meet the requirements of the  age in which He appeared. God's purpose in sending His Prophets unto men  is twofold. The first is to liberate the children of men from the darkness  of ignorance, and guide them to the light of true understanding. The  second is to ensure the peace and tranquillity of mankind, and provide all  the means by which they can be established.    The Prophets of God should be regarded as physicians whose task is to  foster the well-being of the world and its peoples, that, through the  spirit of oneness, they may heal the sickness of a divided humanity. To  none is given the right to question their words or disparage their  conduct, for they are the only ones who can claim to have understood the  patient and to have correctly diagnosed its ailments. No man, however  acute his perception, can ever hope to reach the heights which the wisdom  and understanding of the Divine Physician have attained. Little wonder,  then, if the treatment prescribed by the physician in this day should not  be found to be identical with that which he prescribed before. How could  it be otherwise when the ills affecting the sufferer necessitate at every  stage of his sickness a special remedy? In like manner, every time the  Prophets of God have illumined the world with the resplendent radiance of  the Day Star of Divine knowledge, they have invariably summoned its  peoples to embrace the light of God through such means as best befitted  the exigencies of the age in which they appeared. They were thus able to  scatter the darkness of ignorance, and to shed upon the world the glory of  their own knowledge. It is towards the inmost essence of these Prophets,  therefore, that the eye of every man of discernment must be directed,  inasmuch as their one and only purpose hath always been to guide the  erring, and give peace to the afflicted.... These are not days of  prosperity and triumph. The whole of mankind is in the grip of manifold  ills. Strive, therefore, to save its life through the wholesome medicine  which the almighty hand of the unerring Physician hath prepared.    And now concerning thy question regarding the nature of religion. Know  thou that they who are truly wise have likened the world unto the human  temple. As the body of man needeth a garment to clothe it, so the body of  mankind must needs be adorned with the mantle of justice and wisdom. Its  robe is the Revelation vouchsafed unto it by God. Whenever this robe hath  fulfilled its purpose, the Almighty will assuredly renew it. For every age  requireth a fresh measure of the light of God. Every Divine Revelation  hath been sent down in a manner that befitted the circumstances of the age  in which it hath appeared.    As to thy question regarding the sayings of the leaders of past religions.  Every wise and praiseworthy man will no doubt eschew such vain and  profitless talk. The incomparable Creator hath created all men from one  same substance, and hath exalted their reality above the rest of His  creatures. Success or failure, gain or loss, must, therefore, depend upon  man's own exertions. The more he striveth, the greater will be his  progress. We fain would hope that the vernal showers of the bounty of God  may cause the flowers of true understanding to spring from the soil of  men's hearts, and may wash them from all earthly defilements.            XXXV: PONDER A WHILE. WHAT IS IT THAT PROMPTED,...      Ponder a while. What is it that prompted, in every Dispensation, the  peoples of the earth to shun the Manifestation of the All-Merciful? What  could have impelled them to turn away from Him and to challenge His  authority? Were men to meditate on these words which have flowed from the  Pen of the Divine Ordainer, they would, one and all, hasten to embrace the  truth of this God-given, and ever-enduring Revelation, and would testify  to that which He Himself hath solemnly affirmed. It is the veil of idle  imaginations which, in the days of the Manifestations of the Unity of God  and the Day Springs of His everlasting glory, hath intervened, and will  continue to intervene, between them and the rest of mankind. For in those  days, He Who is the Eternal Truth manifesteth Himself in conformity with  that which He Himself hath purposed, and not according to the desires and  expectations of men. Even as He hath revealed: \"So oft, then, as an  Apostle cometh to you with that which your souls desire not, do ye swell  with pride, and treat some as impostors, and slay others.\"    There can be no doubt whatever that had these Apostles appeared, in bygone  ages and cycles, in accordance with the vain imaginations which the hearts  of men had devised, no one would have repudiated the truth of these  sanctified Beings. Though such men have been, night and day, remembering  the one true God, and have been devoutly engaged in the exercise of their  devotions, yet they failed in the end to recognize, and partake of the  grace of, the Day Springs of the signs of God and the Manifestations of  His irrefutable evidences. To this the Scriptures bear witness. Thou hast,  no doubt, heard about it.    Consider the Dispensation of Jesus Christ. Behold, how all the learned men  of that generation, though eagerly anticipating the coming of the Promised  One, have nevertheless denied Him. Both Annas, the most learned among the  divines of His day, and Caiaphas, the high priest, denounced Him and  pronounced the sentence of His death.    In like manner, when Muhammad, the Prophet of God--may all men be a  sacrifice unto Him--appeared, the learned men of Mecca and Medina arose, in  the early days of His Revelation, against Him and rejected His Message,  while they who were destitute of all learning recognized and embraced His  Faith. Ponder a while. Consider how Balal, the Ethiopian, unlettered  though he was, ascended into the heaven of faith and certitude, whilst  'Abdu'llah Ubayy, a leader among the learned, maliciously strove to oppose  Him. Behold, how a mere shepherd was so carried away by the ecstasy of the  words of God that he was able to gain admittance into the habitation of  his Best-Beloved, and was united to Him Who is the Lord of Mankind, whilst  they who prided themselves on their knowledge and wisdom strayed far from  His path and remained deprived of His grace. For this reason He hath  written: \"He that is exalted among you shall be abased, and he that is  abased shall be exalted.\" References to this theme are to be found in most  of the heavenly Books, as well as in the sayings of the Prophets and  Messengers of God.    Verily I say, such is the greatness of this Cause that the father flieth  from his son, and the son flieth from his father. Call ye to mind the  story of Noah and Canaan. God grant that, in these days of heavenly  delight, ye may not deprive yourselves of the sweet savors of the  All-Glorious God, and may partake, in this spiritual Springtime, of the  outpourings of His grace. Arise in the name of Him Who is the Object of  all knowledge, and, with absolute detachment from the learning of men,  lift up your voices and proclaim His Cause. I swear by the Day Star of  Divine Revelation! The very moment ye arise, ye will witness how a flood  of Divine knowledge will gush out of your hearts, and will behold the  wonders of His heavenly wisdom manifested in all their glory before you.  Were ye to taste of the sweetness of the sayings of the All-Merciful, ye  would unhesitatingly forsake your selves, and would lay down your lives  for the Well-Beloved.    Who can ever believe that this Servant of God hath at any time cherished  in His heart a desire for any earthly honor or benefit? The Cause  associated with His Name is far above the transitory things of this world.  Behold Him, an exile, a victim of tyranny, in this Most Great Prison. His  enemies have assailed Him on every side, and will continue to do so till  the end of His life. Whatever, therefore, He saith unto you is wholly for  the sake of God, that haply the peoples of the earth may cleanse their  hearts from the stain of evil desire, may rend its veil asunder, and  attain unto the knowledge of the one true God--the most exalted station to  which any man can aspire. Their belief or disbelief in My Cause can  neither profit nor harm Me. We summon them wholly for the sake of God. He,  verily, can afford to dispense with all creatures.            XXXVI: KNOW"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16949"],[0,"Flowers from a Persian Garden and Other Papers (#13)"],[1,"of Chinese humour:    A wealthy man lived between the houses of two blacksmiths, and was  constantly annoyed by the noise of their hammers, so that he could not  get rest, night or day. First he asked them to strike more gently; then  he made them great promises if they would remove at once. The two  blacksmiths consented, and he, overjoyed to get rid of them, prepared a  grand banquet for their entertainment. When the banquet was over, he  asked them where they were going to take up their new abodes, and they  replied--to the intense dismay of their worthy host, no doubt: \"He who  lives on the left of your house is going to that on the right; and he  who lives on your right is going to the house on your left.\"    There is a keen satirical hit at the venality of Chinese judges in our  next story. A husbandman, who wished to rear a particular kind of  vegetable, found that the plants always died. He consulted an  experienced gardener as to the best means of preventing the death of  plants. The old man replied: \"The affair is very simple; with every  plant put down a piece of money.\" His friend asked what effect money  could possibly have in a matter of this kind. \"It is the case  now-a-days,\" said the old man, \"that where there is money _life_ is  safe, but where there is none death is the consequence.\"    The tale of Apelles and the shoemaker is familiar to every schoolboy,  but the following story of the Chinese painter and his critics will be  new to most readers: A gentleman having got his portrait painted, the  artist suggested that he should consult the passers-by as to whether it  was a good likeness. Accordingly he asked the first that was going past:  \"Is this portrait like me?\" The man said: \"The _cap_ is very like.\" When  the next was asked, he said: \"The _dress_ is very like.\" He was about to  ask a third, when the painter stopped him, saying: \"The cap and the  dress do not matter much; ask the person what he thinks of the face.\"  The third man hesitated a long time, and then said: \"The _beard_ is very  like.\"           *       *       *       *       *    And now we shall revert once more to Persian jests, many of which are,  however, also current in India, through the medium of the Persian  language. When a man becomes suddenly rich it not unfrequently follows  that he becomes as suddenly oblivious of his old friends. Thus, a  Persian having obtained a lucrative appointment at court, a friend of  his came shortly afterwards to congratulate him thereon. The new  courtier asked him: \"Who are you? And why do you come here?\" The other  coolly replied: \"Do you not know me, then? I am your old friend, and am  come to condole with you, having heard that you had lately lost your  sight.\"--This recalls the clever epigram:      When Jack was poor, the lad was frank and free;      Of late he's grown brimful of pride and pelf;    You wonder that he don't remember me?      Why, don't you see, Jack has forgot himself!    The humour of the following is--to me, at least--simply exquisite: A man  went to a professional scribe and asked him to write a letter for him.  The scribe said that he had a pain in his foot. \"A pain in your foot!\"  echoed the man. \"I don't want to send you to any place that you should  make such an excuse.\" \"Very true,\" said the scribe; \"but, whenever I  write a letter for any one, I am always sent for to read it, because no  one else can make it out.\"--And this is a very fair specimen of ready  wit: During a season of great drought in Persia, a schoolmaster at the  head of his pupils marched out of Shiraz to pray (at the tomb of some  saint in the suburbs) for rain, when they were met by a waggish fellow,  who inquired where they were going. The preceptor informed him, and  added that, no doubt, Allah would listen to the prayers of innocent  children. \"Friend,\" quoth the wit, \"if that were the case, I fear there  would not be a schoolmaster left alive.\"    The \"harmless, necessary cat\" has often to bear the blame of  depredations in which she had no share--especially the \"lodging-house  cat\"; and, that such is the fact in Persia as well as nearer our own  doors, let a story related by the celebrated poet Jami serve as  evidence: A husband gave a _man_ of meat to his wife, bidding her cook  it for his dinner. The woman roasted it and ate it all herself, and when  her husband asked for the meat she said the cat had stolen it. The  husband weighed the cat forthwith, and found that she had not increased  in weight by eating so much meat; so, with a hundred perplexing  thoughts, he struck his hand on his knee, and, upbraiding his wife,  said: \"O lady, doubtless the cat, like the meat, weighed one _man_; the  meat would add another _man_ thereto. This point is not clear to  me--that two _mans_ should become one _man_. If this is the cat, where  is the meat? And if this is the meat, why has it the form of the cat?\"    Readers of our early English jest-books will perhaps remember the story  of a court-jester being facetiously ordered by the king to make out a  list of all the fools in his dominions, who replied that it would be a  much easier task to write down a list of all the wise men. I fancy there  is some trace of this incident in the following Persian story, though  the details are wholly different: Once upon a time a party of merchants  exhibited to a king some fine horses, which pleased him so well that he  bought them, and gave the merchants besides a large sum of money to pay  for more horses which they were to bring from their own country. Some  time after this the king, being merry with wine, said to his chief  vazir: \"Make me out a list of all the blockheads in my kingdom.\" The  vazir replied that he had already made out such a list, and had put his  Majesty's name at the top. \"Why so?\" demanded the king. \"Because,\" said  the vazir, \"you gave a great sum of money for horses to be brought by  merchants for whom no person is surety, nor does any one know to what  country they belong; and this is surely a sign of stupidity.\" \"But what  if they should bring the horses?\" The vazir readily replied: \"If they  should bring the horses, I should then erase your Majesty's name and put  the names of the merchants in its place.\"[30]       [30] A similar incident is found in the 8th chapter of the          Spanish work, _El Conde Lucanor_, written, in the 14th          century, by Prince Don Juan Manuel, where a pretended          alchemist obtains from a king a large sum of money in          order that he should procure in his own distant country          a certain thing necessary for the transmutation of the          baser metals into gold. The impostor, of course, did not          return, and so on, much the same as in the above.--Many          others of Don Manuel's tales are traceable to Eastern          sources; he was evidently familiar with the Arabic          language, and from his long intercourse with the Moors          doubtless became acquainted with Asiatic story-books.          His manner of telling the stories is, however, wholly          his own, and some of them appear to be of his own          invention.--There is a variant of the same story in          _Pasquils Jests and Mother Bunches Merriments_, in which          a servant enters his master's name in a list of all the          fools of his acquaintance, because he had lately lent          his cousin twenty pounds.    Everybody knows the story of the silly old woman who went to market with  a cow and a hen for sale, and asked only five shillings for the cow, but  ten pounds for the hen. But no such fool was the Arab who lost his  camel, and, after a long and fruitless search, anathematised the errant  quadruped and her father and her mother, and swore by the Prophet that,  should he find her, he would sell her for a dirham (sixpence). At length  his search was successful, and he at once regretted his oath; but such  an oath must not be violated, so he tied a cat round the camel's neck,  and went about proclaiming: \"I will sell this camel for a dirham, and  this cat for a hundred dinars (fifty pounds); but I will not sell one  without the other.\" A man who passed by and heard this exclaimed: \"What  a very desirable bargain that camel would be if she had not such a  _collar_ round her neck!\"[31]       [31] A variant of this occurs in the _Heptameron_, an          uncompleted work in imitation of the _Decameron_,          ascribed to Marguerite, queen of Navarre (16th century),          but her _valet de chambre_ Bonaventure des Periers is          supposed to have had a hand in its composition. In Novel          55 it is related that a merchant in Saragossa on his          death-bed desired his wife to sell a fine Spanish horse          for as much as it would fetch and give the money to the          mendicant friars. After his death his widow did not          approve of such a legacy, but, in order to obey her late          husband's will, she instructed a servant to go to the          market and offer the horse for a ducat and her cat for          ninety-nine ducats, both, however, to be sold together.          A gentleman purchased the horse and the cat, well          knowing that the former was fully worth a hundred          ducats, and the widow handed over one ducat--for which          the horse was nominally sold--to the mendicant friars.    For readiness of wit the Arabs would seem to compare very favourably  with any race, European or Asiatic, and many examples of their  felicitous repartees are furnished by native historians and grammarians.  One of the best is: When a khalif was addressing the people in a mosque  on his accession to the khalifate, and told them, among other things in  his own praise, that the plague which had so long raged in Baghdad had  ceased immediately he became khalif; an old fellow present shouted: \"Of  a truth, Allah was too merciful to give us both _thee_ and the plague at  the same"]]]
