Herodotus' account of the fall of       Croesus and of Sardes, borrowed partly from a good written       source, Xanthus or Charon of Lampsacus, partly from the       tradition of the Harpagidse, seems to have for its object       the soothing of the vanity both of the Persians and of the       Lydians, since, if the result of the war could not be       contested, the issue of the battle was at least left       uncertain. If he has given a faithful account, no one can       understand why Croesus should have retired and ceded White       Syria to a rival who had never conquered him. The account       given by Polysenus, in spite of the improbability of some of       its details, comes from a well-informed author: the defeat       of the Lydians in the second battle explains the retreat of       Crcesus, who is without excuse in Herodotus' version of the       affair. Pompeius Trogus adopted a version similar to that of       Polysenus.    Cyrus employed the respite in attempting to win over the Greek cities  of the littoral, which he pictured to himself as nursing a bitter  hatred against the Mermnadae; but it is to be doubted if his emissaries  succeeded even in wresting a declaration of neutrality from the  Milesians; the remainder, Ionians and AEolians, all continued faithful  to their oaths.* On the resumption of hostilities, the tide of fortune  turned, and the Lydians were crushed by the superior forces of the  Persians and the Medes; Crcesus retired under cover of night, burning  the country as he retreated, to prevent the enemy from following him,  and crossed the Halys with the remains of his battalions. The season was  already far advanced; he thought that the Persians, threatened in the  rear by the Babylonian troops, would shrink from the prospect of a  winter campaign, and he fell back upon Sardes without further lingering  in Phrygia. But Nabonidus did not feel himself called upon to show the  same devotion that his ally had evinced towards him, or perhaps the  priests who governed in his name did not permit him to fulfil his  engagements.**         * Herodotus makes the attempted corruption of the Ionians to       date from the beginning of the war, even before Cyrus took       the field.         ** The author followed by Pompeius Trogus has alone       preserved the record of this treaty. The fact is important       as explaining Croesus' behaviour after his defeat, but       Schubert goes too far when he re-establishes on this ground       an actual campaign of Cyrus against Babylon: Radet has come       back to the right view in seeing only a treaty made with       Nabonidus.    As soon as peace was proposed, he accepted terms, without once  considering the danger to which the Lydians were exposed by his  defection. The Persian king raised his camp as soon as all fear of an  attack to rearward was removed, and, falling upon defenceless Phrygia,  pushed forward to Sardes in spite of the inclemency of the season. No  movement could have been better planned, or have produced such  startling results. Croesus had disbanded the greater part of his feudal  contingents, and had kept only his body-guard about him, the remainder  of his army--natives, mercenaries, and allies--having received orders  not to reassemble till the following spring. The king hastily called  together all his available troops, both Lydians and foreigners,  and confronted his enemies for the second time. Even under these  unfavourable conditions he hoped to gain the advantage, had his cavalry,  the finest in the world, been able to take part in the engagement. But  Cyrus had placed in front of his lines a detachment of camels, and the  smell of these animals so frightened the Lydian horses that they snorted  and refused to charge.*         * Herodotus' mention of the use of camels is confirmed, with       various readings, by Xenophon, by Polysenus, and by AElian;       their employment does not necessarily belong to a legendary       form of the story, especially if we suppose that the camel,       unknown before in Asia Minor, was first introduced there by       the Persian army. The site of the battle is not precisely       known. According to Herodotus, the fight took place in the       great plain before Sardes, which is crossed by several small       tributaries of the Hermus, amongst others the Hyllus. Radet       recognises that the Hyllus of Herodotus is the whole or part       of the stream now called the Kusu-tchai, and he places the       scene of action near the township of Adala, which would       correspond with Xenophon's Thymbrara. This continues to be       the most likely hypothesis. After the battle Croesus would       have fled along the Hermus towards Sardes. Xenophon's story       is a pure romance.    Croesus was again worsted on the confines of the plain of the Hermus,  and taking refuge in the citadel of Sardes, he despatched couriers to  his allies in Greece and Egypt to beg for succour without delay. The  Lacedaemonians hurried on the mobilisation of their troops, and their  vessels were on the point of weighing anchor, when the news arrived  that Sardes had fallen in the early days of December, and that Croesus  himself was a prisoner.* How the town came to be taken, the Greeks  themselves never knew, and their chroniclers have given several  different accounts of the event.**         * Radet gives the date of the capture of Sardes as about       November 15, 546; but the number and importance of the       events occurring between the retreat of Croesus and the       decisive catastrophe--the negotiations with Babylon, the       settling into winter quarters, the march of Cyrus across       Phrygia--must have required a longer time than Radet allots       to them in his hypothesis, and I make the date a month       later.         ** Ctesias and Xenophon seem to depend on Herodotus, the       former with additional fabulous details concerning his       OEbaras, Cyrus' counsellor, which show the probable origin       of his additions. Polysenus had at his disposal a different       story, the same probably that he used for his account of the       campaign in Cappadocia, for in it can be recognised the wish       to satisfy, within possible limits, the pride of the       Lydians: here again the decisive success is preceded by a       check given to Cyrus and a three months' truce.    The least improbable is that found in Herodotus. The blockade had  lasted, so he tells us, fourteen days, when Cyrus announced that he  would richly reward the first man to scale the walls. Many were tempted  by his promises, but were unsuccessful in their efforts, and their  failure had discouraged all further attempts, when a Mardian soldier,  named Hyreades, on duty at the foot of the steep slopes overlooking the  Tmolus, saw a Lydian descend from rock to rock in search of his helmet  which he had lost, and regain the city by the same way without any great  difficulty. He noted carefully the exact spot, and in company with a few  comrades climbed up till he reached the ramparts; others followed, and  taking the besieged unawares, they opened the gates to the main body of  the army.*         * About three and a half centuries later Sardes was captured       in the same way by one of the generals of Antiochus the       Great.    Croesus could not bear to survive the downfall of his kingdom: he  erected a funeral pyre in the courtyard of his palace, and took up his  position on it, together with his wives, his daughters, and the noblest  youths of his court, surrounded by his most precious possessions.  He could cite the example of more than one vanquished monarch of the  ancient Asiatic world in choosing such an end, and one of the fabulous  ancestors of his race, Sandon-Herakles, had perished after this fashion  in the midst of the flames. Was the sacrifice carried out? Everything  leads us to believe that it was, but popular feeling could not be  resigned to the idea that a prince who had shown such liberality towards  the gods in his prosperity should be abandoned by them in the time  of his direst need. They came to believe that the Lydian monarch had  expiated by his own defeat the crime by the help of which his ancestor  Gyges had usurped the throne. Apollo had endeavoured to delay the  punishment till the next generation, that it might fall on the son of  his votary, but he had succeeded in obtaining from fate a respite of  three years only. Even then he had not despaired, and had warned Croesus  by the voice of the oracles. They had foretold him that, in crossing the  Halys, the Lydians ^would destroy a great empire, and that their power  would last till the day when a mule should sit upon the throne of Media.  Croesus, blinded by fate, could not see that Cyrus, who was of mixed  race, Persian by his father and Median by his mother, was the predicted  mule. He therefore crossed the Halys, and a great empire fell, but it  was his own. At all events, the god might have desired to show that to  honour his altars and adorn his temple was in itself, after all, the  best of treasures. \"When Sardes, suffering the vengeance of Zeus, was  conquered by the army of the Persians, the god of the golden sword,  Apollo, was the guardian of Croesus. When the day of despair arrived,  the king could not resign himself to tears and servitude; within the  brazen-walled court he erected a funeral pyre, on which, together with  his chaste spouse and his bitterly lamenting daughters of beautiful  locks, he mounted; he raised his hands towards the depths of the ether  and cried: 'Proud fate, where is the gratitude of the gods, where is the  prince, the child of Leto? Where is now the house of Alyattes?... The  ancient citadel of Sardes has fallen, the Pactolus of golden waves  runs red with blood; ignominiously are the women driven from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17330"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C.

They teach us by their workmanship the state of the arts, and by  their weight, number, and purity of metal, the wealth of the country.  They also teach dates, titles, and the places where they were struck;  and even in those cases where they seem to add little to what we learn  from other sources, they are still the living witnesses to which we  appeal, to prove the truth of the authors who have told us more.    [Illustration: 083.jpg COIN OF SOTER, WITH JUPITER]    The art of engraving coins did not flourish alone in Alexandria;  painters and sculptors flocked to Egypt to enjoy the favours of Ptolemy.  Apelles, indeed, whose paintings were thought by those who had seen  them to surpass any that had been before painted, or were likely to be  painted, had quarrelled with Ptolemy, who had known him well when he  was the friend and painter of Alexander. Once when he was at Alexandria,  somebody wickedly told him that he was invited to dine at the royal  table, and when Ptolemy asked who it was that had sent his unwelcome  guest, Apelles drew the face of the mischief-maker on the wall, and he  was known to all the court by the likeness. It was, perhaps, at one  of these dinners, at which Ptolemy enjoyed the society of the men of  letters, or perhaps when visiting the philosophers in their schools,  that he asked Euclid if he could not show him a shorter and easier way  to the higher truths of mathematics than that by which he led the pupils  in the Museum; and Euclid, as if to remind him of the royal roads of  Persia, which ran by the side of the highroads, but were kept clear and  free for the king's own use, made him the well-known answer, that there  was no royal road to geometry.    Ptolemy lived in easy familiarity with the learned men of Alexandria;  and at another of these literary dinners, when Diodorus, the  rhetorician, who was thought to have been the inventor of the Dilemma,  was puzzled by a question put to him by Stilpo, the king in joke said  that his name should be Cronus, a god who had been laughed at in the  comedies. Indeed, he was so teased by Ptolemy for not being able to  answer it, that he got up and left the room. He afterwards wrote a book  upon the subject; but the ridicule was said to have embittered the rest  of his life. This was the person against whom Callimachus, some years  later, wrote a bitter epigram, beginning \"Cronus is a wise man.\"  Diodorus was of the sceptical school of philosophy, which, though not  far removed from the Cyrenaic school, was never popular in Alexandria.  Among other paradoxes he used to deny the existence of motion. He argued  that the motion was not in the place where the body moved from, nor in  the place that the body moved to, and that accordingly it did not exist  at all. Once he met with a violent fall which put his shoulder out of  joint, and he applied to Herophilus, the surgeon, to set it. Herophilus  began by asking him where the fall took place, whether in the place  where the shoulder was, or in the place where it fell to; but the  smarting philosopher begged him to begin by setting his limb, and they  would talk about the existence of motion after the operation.    Stilpo was at this time only on a visit to Ptolemy, for he had refused  his offer of money and a professorship in the Museum, and had chosen  to remain at Megara where he was the ornament of his birthplace. He  had been banished from Athens for speaking against their gods, and for  saying that the colossal Minerva was not the daughter of Jupiter, but of  Phidias, the sculptor. His name as a philosopher stood so high that when  Demetrius, in his late wars with Ptolemy, took the city of Megara by  storm, the conqueror bid spare the house of Stilpo, when temple and  tower went to the ground; and when Demetrius gave orders that Stilpo  should be repaid for what he had lost in the siege, the philosopher  proudly answered that he had lost nothing, and that he had no wealth but  his learning.    The historian Theopompus of Chios then came to Alexandria, and wrote an  account of the wars between the Egyptians and the Persians. It is now  lost, but it contained at least the events from the successful invasion  by Artaxerxes Longimanus till the unsuccessful invasion by Artaxerxes  Mnemon.    No men of learning in Alexandria were more famous than the physicians.  Erasistratus of Cos had the credit of having once cured Antiochus,  afterwards King of Syria. He was the grandson of Aristotle, and may  be called the father of the science of anatomy: his writings are often  quoted by Dioscorides. Antiochus in his youth had fallen deeply in love  with his young stepmother, and was pining away in silence and despair.  Erasistratus found out the cause of his illness, which was straightway  cured by Seleucus giving up his wife to his own son. This act strongly  points out the changed opinions of the world as to the matrimonial  relation; for it was then thought the father's best title to the name  of Nicator; he had before conquered his enemies, but he then conquered  himself.    Erasistratus was the first who thought that a knowledge of anatomy  should be made a part of the healing art. Before his time surgery and  medicine had been deemed one and the same; they had both been studied by  the slow and uncertain steps of experience, unguided by theory. Many a  man who had been ill, whether through disease or wound, and had regained  his health, thought it his duty to Esculapius and to his neighbours to  write up in the temple of the god the nature of his ailings, and the  simples to which he fancied that he owed his cure. By copying these  loose but well-meant inscriptions of medical cases, Hippocrates had,  a century earlier, laid the foundations of the science; but nothing  further was added to it till Erasistratus, setting at nought the  prejudices in which he was born, began dissecting the human body in the  schools of Alexandria. There the mixing together of Greeks and Egyptians  had weakened those religious feelings of respect for the dead which are  usually shocked by anatomy; and this study flourished from the low  tone of the morality as much as from the encouragement which good sense  should grant to every search for knowledge.    Herophilus lived about the same time with Erasistratus, and was, like  him, famous for his knowledge of the anatomy of man. But so hateful was  this study in the eyes of many, that these anatomists were charged by  writers who ought to have known better, with the cruelty of cutting  men open when alive. They had few followers in the hated use of the  dissecting-knife. It was from their writings that Galen borrowed the  anatomical parts of his work; and thus it was to the dissections of  these two great men, helped indeed by opening the bodies of animals,  that the world owed almost the whole of its knowledge of the anatomy of  man, till the fifteenth century, when surgeons were again bold enough to  face the outcry of the mob, and to study the human body with the knife.    Hegesias of Cyrene was an early lecturer on philosophy at Alexandria.  His short and broken sentences are laughed at by Cicero, yet he was so  much listened to, when lecturing against the fear of death, and showing  that in quitting life we leave behind us more pains than pleasures, that  he was stopped by Ptolemy Soter through fear of his causing self-murder  among his hearers. He then wrote a book upon the same subject, for  though the state watched over the public teaching, it took no notice  of books; writing had not yet become the mightiest power on earth. The  miseries, however, of this world, which he so eloquently and feelingly  described in his lectures and writings, did not drive him to put an end  to his own life.    Philostephanus of Cyrene, the friend of Callimachus, was a naturalist  who wrote upon fishes, and is the first investigator that we hear of who  thought it desirable to limit his studies to one branch of the science  of natural history.    But Cyrene did not send all its great men to Alexandria. Plato had  studied mathematics there under Theodorus, and it had a school of its  own which gave its name to the Cyrenaic sect. The founder of this sect  was Aristippus, the pupil of Socrates who had missed the high honour of  being present at his death. He was the first philosopher who took money  from his pupils, and used to say that they valued their lessons more  for having to pay for them; but he was blamed by his brethren for  thus lowering the dignity of the teacher. He died several years before  Ptolemy Soter came into Egypt. The Cyrenaic sect thought happiness,  not goodness, was the end to be aimed at through life, and selfishness,  rather than kindness to others, the right spring of men's actions. It  would hardly be fair to take their opinions from the mouths of their  enemies; and the dialogues of Socrates, with their founder, as told to  us by Xeno-phon, would prove a lower tone of morality than he is likely  to have held. The wish for happiness and the philosophical love of self,  which should lead to goodness, though a far worse rule of life than the  love of goodness for its own sake, which is the groundwork of religion,  was certainly far better than unguided passion and the love of to-day's  pleasure. But often as this unsafe rule has been set up for our  guidance, there have always been found many to make use of it in a way  not meant by the teacher. The Cyrenaic sect soon fell into the disrepute  to which these principles were likely to lead it, and wholly ceased when  Epicurus taught the same opinions more philosophically, Anniceris of  Cyrene, though a follower of Aristippus, somewhat improved upon the  low-toned philosophy of his master. He granted that there were many  things worth our aim, which could not be brought within the narrow  bounds of what is useful. He did not overlook"]]]
