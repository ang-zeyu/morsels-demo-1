After seven years of marriage, the wife of Desnoyers found that she,  too, was going to become a mother. Her sister already had three sons.  But what were they worth to Madariaga compared to the grandson that was  going to come? \"It will be a boy,\" he announced positively, \"because I  need one so. It shall be named Julio, and I hope that it will look like  my poor dead wife.\"    Since the death of his wife he no longer called her the China, feeling  something of a posthumous love for the poor woman who in her lifetime  had endured so much, so timidly and silently. Now \"my poor dead wife\"  cropped out every other instant in the conversation of the remorseful  ranchman.    His desires were fulfilled. Luisa gave birth to a boy who bore the name  of Julio, and although he did not show in his somewhat sketchy features  any striking resemblance to his grandmother, still he had the black  hair and eyes and olive skin of a brunette. Welcome! . . . This WAS a  grandson!    In the generosity of his joy, he even permitted the German to enter the  house for the baptismal ceremony.    When Julio Desnoyers was two years old, his grandfather made the rounds  of his estates, holding him on the saddle in front of him. He went from  ranch to ranch in order to show him to the copper-colored populace, like  an ancient monarch presenting his heir. Later on, when the child was  able to say a few words, he entertained himself for hours at a time  talking with the tot under the shade of the eucalyptus tree. A certain  mental failing was beginning to be noticed in the old man. Although not  exactly in his dotage, his aggressiveness was becoming very childish.  Even in his most affectionate moments, he used to contradict everybody,  and hunt up ways of annoying his relatives.    \"Come here, you false prophet,\" he would say to Julio. \"You are a  Frenchy.\"    The grandchild protested as though he had been insulted. His mother had  taught him that he was an Argentinian, and his father had suggested that  she also add Spanish, in order to please the grandfather.    \"Very well, then; if you are not a Frenchy, shout, 'Down with  Napoleon!'\"    And he looked around him to see if Desnoyers might be near, believing  that this would displease him greatly. But his son-in-law pursued the  even tenor of his way, shrugging his shoulders.    \"Down with Napoleon!\" repeated Julio.    And he instantly held out his hand while his grandfather went through  his pockets.    Karl's sons, now four in number, used to circle around their grandparent  like a humble chorus kept at a distance, and stare enviously at these  gifts. In order to win his favor, they one day when they saw him alone,  came boldly up to him, shouting in unison, \"Down with Napoleon!\"    \"You insolent gringoes!\" ranted the old man. \"That's what that shameless  father has taught you! If you say that again, I'll chase you with a  cat-o-nine-tails. . . . The very idea of insulting a great man in that  way!\"    While he tolerated this blond brood, he never would permit the slightest  intimacy. Desnoyers and his wife often had to come to their rescue,  accusing the grandfather of injustice. And in order to pour the vials of  his wrath out on someone, the old plainsman would hunt up Celedonio, the  best of his listeners, who invariably replied, \"Yes, Patron. That's so,  Patron.\"    \"They're not to blame,\" agreed the old man, \"but I can't abide them!  Besides, they are so like their father, so fair, with hair like a  shredded carrot, and the two oldest wearing specs as if they were court  clerks! . . . They don't seem like folks with those glasses; they look  like sharks.\"    Madariaga had never seen any sharks, but he imagined them, without  knowing why, with round, glassy eyes, like the bottoms of bottles.    By the time he was eight years old, Julio was a famous little  equestrian. \"To horse, peoncito,\" his grandfather would cry, and away  they would race, streaking like lightning across the fields, midst  thousands and thousands of horned herds. The \"peoncito,\" proud of his  title, obeyed the master in everything, and so learned to whirl the  lasso over the steers, leaving them bound and conquered. Upon making  his pony take a deep ditch or creep along the edge of the cliffs, he  sometimes fell under his mount, but clambered up gamely.    \"Ah, fine cowboy!\" exclaimed the grandfather bursting with pride in his  exploits. \"Here are five dollars for you to give a handkerchief to some  china.\"    The old man, in his increasing mental confusion, did not gauge his gifts  exactly with the lad's years; and the infantile horseman, while keeping  the money, was wondering what china was referred to, and why he should  make her a present.    Desnoyers finally had to drag his son away from the baleful teachings  of his grandfather. It was simply useless to have masters come to the  house, or to send Julio to the country school. Madariaga would always  steal his grandson away, and then they would scour the plains together.  So when the boy was eleven years old, his father placed him in a big  school in the Capital.    The grandfather then turned his attention to Julio's three-year-old  sister, exhibiting her before him as he had her brother, as he took her  from ranch to ranch. Everybody called Chicha's little girl Chichi, but  the grandfather bestowed on her the same nickname that he had given her  brother, the \"peoncito.\" And Chichi, who was growing up wild, vigorous  and wilful, breakfasting on meat and talking in her sleep of roast beef,  readily fell in with the old man's tastes. She was dressed like a boy,  rode astride like a man, and in order to win her grandfather's praises  as \"fine cowboy,\" carried a knife in the back of her belt. The two raced  the fields from sun to sun, Madariaga following the flying pigtail of  the little Amazon as though it were a flag. When nine years old she,  too, could lasso the cattle with much dexterity.    What most irritated the ranchman was that his family would remember his  age. He received as insults his son-in-law's counsels to remain quietly  at home, becoming more aggressive and reckless as he advanced in years,  exaggerating his activity, as if he wished to drive Death away. He  accepted no help except from his harum-scarum \"Peoncito.\" When Karl's  children, great hulking youngsters, hastened to his assistance and  offered to hold his stirrup, he would repel them with snorts of  indignation.    \"So you think I am no longer able to help myself, eh! . . . There's  still enough life in me to make those who are waiting for me to die, so  as to grab my dollars, chew their disappointment a long while yet!\"    Since the German and his wife were kept pointedly apart from the family  life, they had to put up with these allusions in silence. Karl,  needing protection, constantly shadowed the Frenchman, improving every  opportunity to overwhelm him with his eulogies. He never could thank him  enough for all that he had done for him. He was his only champion. He  longed for a chance to prove his gratitude, to die for him if necessary.  His wife admired him with enthusiasm as \"the most gifted knight in the  world.\" And Desnoyers received their devotion in gratified silence,  accepting the German as an excellent comrade. As he controlled  absolutely the family fortune, he aided Karl very generously without  arousing the resentment of the old man. He also took the initiative in  bringing about the realization of Karl's pet ambition--a visit to the  Fatherland. So many years in America! . . . For the very reason that  Desnoyers himself had no desire to return to Europe, he wished to  facilitate Karl's trip, and gave him the means to make the journey with  his entire family. The father-in-law had no curiosity as to who paid the  expenses. \"Let them go!\" he said gleefully, \"and may they never return!\"    Their absence was not a very long one, for they spent their year's  allowance in three months. Karl, who had apprised his parents of the  great fortune which his marriage had brought him, wished to make an  impression as a millionaire, in full enjoyment of his riches. Elena  returned radiant, speaking with pride of her relatives--of the baron,  Colonel of Hussars, of the Captain of the Guard, of the Councillor  at Court--asserting that all countries were most insignificant when  compared with her husband's. She even affected a certain condescension  toward Desnoyers, praising him as \"a very worthy man, but without  ancient lineage or distinguished family--and French, besides.\"    Karl, on the other hand, showed the same devotion as before, keeping  himself submissively in the background when with his brother-in-law  who had the keys of the cash box and was his only defense against the  browbeating old Patron. . . . He had left his two older sons in a school  in Germany. Years afterwards they reached an equal footing with the  other grandchildren of the Spaniard who always begrudged them their  existence, \"perfect frights, with carroty hair, and eyes like a shark.\"    Suddenly the old man became very lonely, for they had also carried off  his second \"Peoncito.\" The good Chicha could not tolerate her daughter's  growing up like a boy, parading 'round on horseback all the time, and  glibly repeating her grandfather's vulgarities. So she was now in a  convent in the Capital, where the Sisters had to battle valiantly in  order to tame the mischievous rebellion of their wild little pupil.    When Julio and Chichi returned to the ranch for their vacations, the  grandfather again concentrated his fondness on the first, as though the  girl had merely been a substitute. Desnoyers was becoming indignant  at his son's dissipated life. He was no longer at college, and his  existence was that of a student in a rich family who makes up for  parental parsimony with all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1487"],[0,"The Perfect Wagnerite: A Commentary on the Niblung's Ring (#13)"],[1," as the salvation of the country from gloom, devil worship and starvation  of the affections. The Puritan is ready to try the Commonwealth again  with a few modern improvements: the Amateur is equally ready to try the  Restoration with modern enlightenments. And so for the present we must  be content to proceed by reactions, hoping that each will establish some  permanently practical and beneficial reform or moral habit that will  survive the correction of its excesses by the next reaction.          DRAMATIC ORIGIN OF WOTAN    We can now see how a single drama in which Wotan does not appear, and of  which Siegfried is the hero, expanded itself into a great fourfold  drama of which Wotan is the hero. You cannot dramatize a reaction by  personifying the reacting force only, any more than Archimedes could  lift the world without a fulcrum for his lever. You must also personify  the established power against which the new force is reacting; and  in the conflict between them you get your drama, conflict being the  essential ingredient in all drama. Siegfried, as the hero of Die  Gotterdammerung, is only the primo tenore robusto of an opera book,  deferring his death, after he has been stabbed in the last act, to  sing rapturous love strains to the heroine exactly like Edgardo in  Donizetti's Lucia. In order to make him intelligible in the wider  significance which his joyous, fearless, conscienceless heroism soon  assumed in Wagner's imagination, it was necessary to provide him with a  much vaster dramatic antagonist than the operatic villain Hagen. Hence  Wagner had to create Wotan as the anvil for Siegfried's hammer; and  since there was no room for Wotan in the original opera book, Wagner  had to work back to a preliminary drama reaching primarily to the very  beginnings of human society. And since, on this world-embracing scale,  it was clear that Siegfried must come into conflict with many baser  and stupider forces than those lofty ones of supernatural religion and  political constitutionalism typified by Wotan and his wife Fricka, these  minor antagonists had to be dramatized also in the persons of Alberic,  Mime, Fafnir, Loki, and the rest. None of these appear in Night Falls On  The Gods save Alberic, whose weird dream-colloquy with Hagen, effective  as it is, is as purely theatrical as the scene of the Ghost in Hamlet,  or the statue in Don Giovanni. Cut the conference of the Norns and the  visit of Valtrauta to Brynhild out of Night Falls On The Gods, and the  drama remains coherent and complete without them. Retain them, and the  play becomes connected by conversational references with the three music  dramas; but the connection establishes no philosophic coherence, no  real identity between the operatic Brynhild of the Gibichung episode  (presently to be related) and the daughter of Wotan and the First  Mother.          THE LOVE PANACEA    We shall now find that at the point where The Ring changes from  music drama into opera, it also ceases to be philosophic, and becomes  didactic. The philosophic part is a dramatic symbol of the world as  Wagner observed it. In the didactic part the philosophy degenerates into  the prescription of a romantic nostrum for all human ills. Wagner, only  mortal after all, succumbed to the panacea mania when his philosophy was  exhausted, like any of the rest of us.    The panacea is by no means an original one. Wagner was anticipated in  the year 1819 by a young country gentleman from Sussex named Shelley, in  a work of extraordinary artistic power and splendor. Prometheus Unbound  is an English attempt at a Ring; and when it is taken into account that  the author was only 27 whereas Wagner was 40 when he completed the poem  of The Ring, our vulgar patriotism may find an envious satisfaction in  insisting upon the comparison. Both works set forth the same conflict  between humanity and its gods and governments, issuing in the redemption  of man from their tyranny by the growth of his will into perfect  strength and self-confidence; and both finish by a lapse into  panacea-mongering didacticism by the holding up of Love as the remedy  for all evils and the solvent of all social difficulties.    The differences between Prometheus Unbound and The Ring are as  interesting as the likenesses. Shelley, caught in the pugnacity of his  youth and the first impetuosity of his prodigious artistic power by  the first fierce attack of the New Reformation, gave no quarter to  the antagonist of his hero. His Wotan, whom he calls Jupiter, is the  almighty fiend into whom the Englishman's God had degenerated during two  centuries of ignorant Bible worship and shameless commercialism. He is  Alberic, Fafnir Loki and the ambitious side of Wotan all rolled into  one melodramatic demon who is finally torn from his throne and hurled  shrieking into the abyss by a spirit representing that conception  of Eternal Law which has been replaced since by the conception of  Evolution. Wagner, an older, more experienced man than the Shelley of  1819, understood Wotan and pardoned him, separating him tenderly from  all the compromising alliances to which Shelley fiercely held him;  making the truth and heroism which overthrow him the children of his  inmost heart; and representing him as finally acquiescing in and working  for his own supersession and annihilation. Shelley, in his later works,  is seen progressing towards the same tolerance, justice, and humility  of spirit, as he advanced towards the middle age he never reached. But  there is no progress from Shelley to Wagner as regards the panacea,  except that in Wagner there is a certain shadow of night and death come  on it: nay, even a clear opinion that the supreme good of love is that  it so completely satisfies the desire for life, that after it the Will  to Live ceases to trouble us, and we are at last content to achieve the  highest happiness of death.    This reduction of the panacea to absurdity was not forced upon Shelley,  because the love which acts as a universal solvent in his Prometheus  Unbound is a sentiment of affectionate benevolence which has nothing to  do with sexual passion. It might, and in fact does exist in the absence  of any sexual interest whatever. The words mercy and kindness connote it  less ambiguously than the word love. But Wagner sought always for some  point of contact between his ideas and the physical senses, so that  people might not only think or imagine them in the eighteenth century  fashion, but see them on the stage, hear them from the orchestra, and  feel them through the infection of passionate emotion. Dr. Johnson  kicking the stone to confute Berkeley is not more bent on common-sense  concreteness than Wagner: on all occasions he insists on the need  for sensuous apprehension to give reality to abstract comprehension,  maintaining, in fact, that reality has no other meaning. Now he could  apply this process to poetic love only by following it back to its  alleged origin in sexual passion, the emotional phenomena of which he  has expressed in music with a frankness and forcible naturalism which  would possibly have scandalized Shelley. The love duet in the first act  of The Valkyries is brought to a point at which the conventions of our  society demand the precipitate fall of the curtain; whilst the prelude  to Tristan and Isolde is such an astonishingly intense and faithful  translation into music of the emotions which accompany the union of a  pair of lovers, that it is questionable whether the great popularity of  this piece at our orchestral concerts really means that our audiences  are entirely catholic in their respect for life in all its beneficently  creative functions, or whether they simply enjoy the music without  understanding it.    But however offensive and inhuman may be the superstition which brands  such exaltations of natural passion as shameful and indecorous, there is  at least as much common sense in disparaging love as in setting it up as  a panacea. Even the mercy and loving-kindness of Shelley do not hold good  as a universal law of conduct: Shelley himself makes extremely short  work of Jupiter, just as Siegfried does of Fafnir, Mime, and Wotan; and  the fact that Prometheus is saved from doing the destructive part of  his work by the intervention of that very nebulous personification of  Eternity called Demogorgon, does not in the least save the situation,  because, flatly, there is no such person as Demogorgon, and if  Prometheus does not pull down Jupiter himself, no one else will. It  would be exasperating, if it were not so funny, to see these poets  leading their heroes through blood and destruction to the conclusion  that, as Browning's David puts it (David of all people!), \"All's Love;  yet all's Law.\"    Certainly it is clear enough that such love as that implied by  Siegfried's first taste of fear as he cuts through the mailed coat of  the sleeping figure on the mountain, and discovers that it is a woman;  by her fierce revolt against being touched by him when his terror gives  way to ardor; by his manly transports of victory; and by the womanly  mixture of rapture and horror with which she abandons herself to the  passion which has seized on them both, is an experience which it is much  better, like the vast majority of us, never to have passed through, than  to allow it to play more than a recreative holiday part in our lives. It  did not play a very large part in Wagner's own laborious life, and does  not occupy more than two scenes of The Ring. Tristan and Isolde, wholly  devoted to it, is a poem of destruction and death. The Mastersingers,  a work full of health, fun and happiness, contains not a single bar  of love music that can be described as passionate: the hero of it is  a widower who cobbles shoes, writes verses, and contents himself with  looking on at the sweetheartings of his customers. Parsifal makes an end  of it altogether. The truth is that the"]]]
