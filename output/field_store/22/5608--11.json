About sundown we made it to where we intended to camp and found that  Mrs. O'Shaughnessy had established a sheep-camp there, and was out with  her herd herself, having only Manny, a Mexican boy she had brought up  herself, for a herder. She welcomed us cordially and began supper for  our entire bunch. Soon the wagons came, and all was confusion for a few  minutes getting the horses put away for the night. Aggie went to her  wagon as soon as it stopped and made secure her butter and eggs  against a possible raid by Mrs. O'Shaughnessy. Having asked too high a  price for them, she had failed to sell them and was taking them back.  After supper we were sitting around the fire, Tam going over his  account and lamenting that because of his absent-mindedness he had  bought a whole hundred pounds of sugar more than he had intended, Aggie  and Archie silent for once, pouting I suspect. Clyde smiled across the  camp-fire at me and said, \"Gin ye had sic a lass as I hae, ye might  blither.\" \"Gin ye had sic a mon as mine--\" I began, but Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy said, \"Gin ye had sic a mon as I hae.\" Then we all three  laughed, for we had each heard the same thing, and we knew the  McEttricks wouldn't fight each other. They suspected us of laughing at  them, for Archie said to Aggie, \"Aggie, lass, is it sport they are  making of our love?\" \"'T is daft they be, Archie, lad; we'll nae mind  their blither.\" She arose and shambled across to Archie and hunkered  her big self down beside him. We went to bed and left them peaceable  for once.    I am really ashamed of the way I have treated you, but I know you will  forgive me. I am not strong yet, and my eyes are still bothering me,  but I hope to be all right soon now, and I promise you a better letter  next time. Jerrine is very proud of her necklace. I think they are so  nice for children. I can remember how proud I was of mine when I was a  child. Please give your brother our thanks, and tell him his little  gift made my little girl very happy.    I am afraid this letter will seem rather jumbled. I still want the  address of your friend in Salem or any other. I shall find time to  write, and I am not going to let my baby prevent me from having many  enjoyable outings. We call our boy Henry Clyde for his father. He is a  dear little thing, but he is a lusty yeller for baby's rights.      With much love,      JERRINE AND HER MAMMA.          XIII    PROVING UP           _October 14, 1911._    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    I think you must be expecting an answer to your letter by now, so I  will try to answer as many of your questions as I remember. Your letter  has been mislaid. We have been very much rushed all this week. We had  the thresher crew two days. I was busy cooking for them two days before  they came, and have been busy ever since cleaning up after them. Clyde  has taken the thresher on up the valley to thresh for the neighbors,  and all the men have gone along, so the children and I are alone. No, I  shall not lose my land, although it will be over two years before I can  get a deed to it. The five years in which I am required to \"prove up\"  will have passed by then. I couldn't have held my homestead if Clyde  had also been proving up, but he had accomplished that years ago and  has his deed, so I am allowed my homestead. Also I have not yet used my  desert right, so I am still entitled to one hundred and sixty acres  more. I shall file on that much some day when I have sufficient money  of my own earning. The law requires a cash payment of twenty-five cents  per acre at the filing, and one dollar more per acre when final proof  is made. I should not have married if Clyde had not promised I should  meet all my land difficulties unaided. I wanted the fun and the  experience. For that reason I want to earn every cent that goes into my  own land and improvements myself. Sometimes I almost have a brain-storm  wondering how I am going to do it, but I know I shall succeed; other  women have succeeded. I know of several who are now where they can  laugh at past trials. Do you know?--I am a firm believer in laughter. I  am real superstitious about it. I think if Bad Luck came along, he  would take to his heels if some one laughed right loudly.    I think Jerrine must be born for the law. She always threshes out  questions that arise, to her own satisfaction, if to no one else's. She  prayed for a long time for her brother; also she prayed for some  puppies. The puppies came, but we didn't let her know they were here  until they were able to walk. One morning she saw them following their  mother, so she danced for joy. When her little brother came she was  plainly disappointed. \"Mamma,\" she said, \"did God really make the  baby?\" \"Yes, dear.\" \"Then He hasn't treated us fairly, and I should  like to know why. The puppies could walk when He finished them; the  calves can, too. The pigs can, and the colt, and even the chickens.  What is the use of giving us a half-finished baby? He has no hair, and  no teeth; he can't walk or talk, nor do anything else but squall and  sleep.\"    After many days she got the question settled. She began right where  she left off. \"I know, Mamma, why God gave us such a half-finished  baby; so he could learn our ways, and no one else's, since he must live  with us, and so we could learn to love him. Every time I stand beside  his buggy he laughs and then I love him, but I don't love Stella nor  Marvin because they laugh. So that is why.\" Perhaps that is the reason.    Zebbie's kinsfolk have come and taken him back to Yell County. I should  not be surprised if he never returned. The Lanes and the Pattersons  leave shortly for Idaho, where \"our Bobbie\" has made some large  investments.    I hope to hear from you soon and that you are enjoying every minute.  With much love,      Your friend,      ELINORE STEWART.          XIV    THE NEW HOUSE           _December 1, 1911._    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    I feel just like visiting to-night, so I am going to \"play like\" you  have come. It is so good to have you to chat with. Please be seated in  this low rocker; it is a present to me from the Pattersons and I am  very proud of it. I am just back from the Patterson ranch, and they  have a dear little boy who came the 20th of November and they call him  Robert Lane.    I am sure this room must look familiar to you, for there is so much in  it that was once yours. I have two rooms, each fifteen by fifteen, but  this one on the south is my \"really\" room and in it are my treasures.  My house faces east and is built up against a side-hill, or should I  say hillside? Anyway, they had to excavate quite a lot. I had them  dump the dirt right before the house and terrace it smoothly. I have  sown my terrace to California poppies, and around my porch, which is  six feet wide and thirty long, I have planted wild cucumbers.    Every log in my house is as straight as a pine can grow. Each room has  a window and a door on the east side, and the south room has two  windows on the south with space between for my heater, which is one of  those with a grate front so I can see the fire burn. It is almost as  good as a fireplace. The logs are unhewed outside because I like the  rough finish, but inside the walls are perfectly square and smooth. The  cracks in the walls are snugly filled with \"daubing\" and then the walls  are covered with heavy gray building-paper, which makes the room very  warm, and I really like the appearance. I had two rolls of wall-paper  with a bold rose pattern. By being very careful I was able to cut out  enough of the roses, which are divided in their choice of color as to  whether they should be red, yellow, or pink, to make a border about  eighteen inches from the ceiling. They brighten up the wall and the  gray paper is fine to hang pictures upon. Those you have sent us make  our room very attractive. The woodwork is stained a walnut brown, oil  finish, and the floor is stained and oiled just like it. In the corners  by the stove and before the windows we take our comfort.    From some broken bamboo fishing-rods I made frames for two screens.  These I painted black with some paint that was left from the buggy, and  Gavotte fixed the screens so they will stay balanced, and put in  casters for me. I had a piece of blue curtain calico and with  brass-headed tacks I put it on the frame of Jerrine's screen, then I  mixed some paste and let her decorate it to suit herself on the side  that should be next her corner. She used the cards you sent her. Some  of the people have a suspiciously tottering appearance, perhaps not so  very artistic, but they all mean something to a little girl whose  small fingers worked patiently to attain satisfactory results. She has  a set of shelves on which her treasures of china are arranged. On the  floor is a rug made of two goatskins dyed black, a present from  Gavotte, who heard her admiring Zebbie's bearskin. She has a tiny red  rocking-chair which she has outgrown, but her rather dilapidated family  of dolls use it for an automobile. For a seat for herself she has a  small hassock that you gave me, and behind the blue screen is a world  apart.    My screen is made just like Jerrine's except that the cover is cream  material with sprays of wild roses over it. In my corner I have a cot  made up like a couch. One of my pillows is covered with some checked  gingham that \"Dawsie\" cross-stitched for me. I have a cabinet bookcase  made from an old walnut bedstead that was a relic of the Mountain  Meadow Massacre. Gavotte made it for me. In it I have my few books,  some odds and ends of china, all gifts, and a few fossil curios. For a  floor-covering I have a braided rug of blue and white, made from old  sheets and Jerrine's old dresses. In the center of my room is a square  table made of pine and stained brown. Over it is a table-cover that you  gave me. Against the wall near my bed is my \"dresser.\" It is a box with  shelves and is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16643"],[0,"Essays (#13)"],[1," very unnecessary.    The nonchalance[160] of boys who are sure of a dinner, and would  disdain as much as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one, is the  healthy attitude of human nature. A boy is in the parlor what the pit  is in the playhouse;[161] independent, irresponsible, looking out from  his corner on such people and facts as pass by, he tries and sentences  them on their merits, in the swift, summary way of boys, as good, bad,  interesting, silly, eloquent, troublesome. He cumbers himself never  about consequences about interests; he gives an independent, genuine  verdict. You must court him: he does not court you. But the man is, as  it were, clapped into jail by his consciousness. As soon as he has  once acted or spoken with _eclat_[162] he is a committed person,  watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds, whose affections  must now enter into his account. There is no Lethe[163] for this. Ah,  that he could pass again into his neutrality! Who[164] can thus avoid  all pledges, and having observed, observe again from the same  unaffected, unbiased, unbribable, unaffrighted innocence, must always  be formidable. He would utter opinions on all passing affairs, which  being seen to be not private, but necessary, would sink like darts  into the ear of men, and put them in fear.    These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint  and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in  conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is  a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better  securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty  and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity.  Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators,  but names and customs.    Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist.[165] He who would gather  immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must  explore if it be goodness.[166] Nothing is at last sacred but the  integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall  have the suffrage[167] of the world. I remember an answer which when  quite young I was prompted to make to a valued adviser, who was wont  to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the church. On my  saying, What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live  wholly from within? my friend suggested: \"But these impulses may be  from below, not from above.\" I replied: \"They do not seem to me to be  such; but if I am the Devil's child, I will live then from the Devil.\"  No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but  names very readily transferable to that or this;[168] the only right  is what is after my constitution, the only wrong what is against it. A  man is to carry himself in the presence of all opposition, as if  everything were titular and ephemeral but he. I am ashamed to think  how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large societies and  dead institutions. Every decent and well-spoken individual affects and  sways me more than is right. I ought to go upright and vital, and  speak the rude truth in all ways. If malice and vanity wear the coat  of philanthropy, shall that pass? If an angry bigot assumes this  bountiful cause of Abolition, and comes to me with his last news from  Barbadoes,[169] why should I not say to him: \"Go love thy infant; love  thy wood-chopper: be good-natured and modest: have that grace; and  never varnish your hard, uncharitable ambition with this incredible  tenderness for black folk a thousand miles off. Thy love afar is  spite at home.\" Rough and graceless would be such greeting, but truth  is handsomer than the affectation of love. Your goodness must have  some edge to it,--else it is none. The doctrine of hatred must be  preached as the counteraction of the doctrine of love when that pules  and whines. I shun father and mother and wife and brother, when my  genius calls me. I would write on the lintels of the door-post,  _Whim_.[170] I hope it is somewhat better than whim at last, but we  cannot spend the day in explanation. Expect me not to show cause why I  seek or why I exclude company. Then, again, do not tell me, as a good  man did to-day, of my obligation to put all poor men in good  situations. Are they _my_ poor? I tell thee, thou foolish  philanthropist, that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the cent, I give  to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not belong. There  is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual affinity I am bought  and sold; for them I will go to prison, if need be; but your  miscellaneous popular charities; the education at college of fools;  the building of meeting-houses to the vain end to which many now  stand; alms to sots; and the thousand-fold Relief Societies;--though I  confess with shame I sometimes succumb and give the dollar, it is a  wicked dollar which by and by I shall have the manhood to withhold.    Virtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception than the  rule. There is the man _and_ his virtues. Men do what is called a good  action, as some piece of courage or charity, much as they would pay a  fine in expiation of daily non-appearance on parade. Their works are  done as an apology or extenuation of their living in the world,--as  invalids and the insane pay a high board. Their virtues are penances.  I do not wish to expiate, but to live. My life is for itself and not  for a spectacle. I much prefer that it should be of a lower strain, so  it be genuine and equal, than that it should be glittering and  unsteady. I wish it to be sound and sweet, and not to need diet and  bleeding.[171] I ask primary evidence that you are a man, and refuse  this appeal from the man to his actions. I know that for myself it  makes no difference whether I do or forbear those actions which are  reckoned excellent. I cannot consent to pay for a privilege where I  have intrinsic right. Few and mean as my gifts may be, I actually am,  and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows  any secondary testimony.    What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think.  This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may  serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is  the harder, because you will always find those who think they know  what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to  live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after  our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps  with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.[172]    The objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is,  that it scatters your force. It loses your time and blurs the  impression of your character. If you maintain a dead church,  contribute to a dead Bible-society, vote with a great party either for  the government or against it, spread your table like base  housekeepers,--under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the  precise[173] man you are. And, of course, so much force is withdrawn  from your proper life. But do your work, and I shall know you.[174] Do  your work, and you shall reinforce yourself. A man must consider what  a blindman's-buff is this game of conformity. If I know your sect, I  anticipate your argument. I hear a preacher announce for his text and  topic the expediency of one of the institutions of his church. Do I  not know beforehand that not possibly can he say a new and spontaneous  word? Do I not know that, with[175] all this ostentation of examining  the grounds of the institution, he will do no such thing? Do I not  know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at one side,--the  permitted side, not as a man, but as a parish minister? He is a  retained attorney, and these airs of the bench[176] are the emptiest  affectation. Well, most men have bound their eyes with one or another  handkerchief,[177] and attached themselves to some one of these  communities of opinion.[178] This conformity makes them not false in a  few particulars, authors of a few lies, but false in all particulars.  Their every truth is not quite true. Their two is not the real two,  their four not the real four; so that every word they say chagrins us,  and we know not where to begin to set them right. Meantime nature is  not slow to equip us in the prison-uniform of the party to which we  adhere. We come to wear one cut of face and figure, and acquire by  degrees the gentlest asinine expression. There is a mortifying  experience in particular which does not fail to wreak itself also in  the general history; I mean \"the foolish face of praise,\" the forced  smile which we put on in company where we do not feel at ease in  answer to conversation which does not interest us. The muscles, not  spontaneously moved, but moved by a low usurping willfulness, grow  tight about the outline of the face with the most disagreeable  sensation.    For nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure.[179] And  therefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face. The bystanders  look askance on him in the public street or in the friend's parlor. If  this aversation had its origin in contempt and resistance like his  own, he might well go home with a sad countenance; but the sour faces  of the multitude, like their sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are  put on and off as the wind blows and a newspaper directs.[180] Yet is  the discontent of the multitude more formidable than that of the  senate and the college. It is easy enough for a firm man who knows the  world to brook the rage of the cultivated classes. Their rage is  decorous and prudent, for they are timid as being very vulnerable  themselves. But when to their feminine rage the indignation of the  people is added, when the ignorant and the poor are aroused, when the  unintelligent brute force that lies at the bottom of"]]]
