FROM AN INTERVIEW GIVEN BY 'ABDU'L-BAHA TO THE WEEKLY BUDGET.                                September 23rd, 1911.          SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES OF HIS FORTY YEARS IMPRISONMENT      In an apartment in Cadogan Gardens sits a spiritually illumined Oriental,  whose recent advent in London marks the latest junction of the East and  West.    The teaching of 'Abdu'l-Baha has already brought about the commingling of  thousands of Englishmen and Englishwomen with Orientals from every quarter  of the East. Upon the basis of mutual help and friendship and the worship  of God, regardless of creed and denomination, they have joined hands with  an earnestness and brotherly love contrary to the theories of certain  cynical poets and philosophers.    Most of 'Abdu'l-Baha's life has been spent in an Eastern prison, which he  gladly endured rather than abjure his faith, one of the tenets of which is  the absolute equality of souls regardless of physical differences, such as  sex and colour. He recognizes no class distinctions except those conferred  by service and the spirit of brotherly love. For this and other like  doctrines he was held prisoner for forty years in the fortress city of  Akka, in Palestine. When I requested to talk with him, I was told to come  early, and called, according, at nine o'clock, for an interview. It was  already mid-day to 'Abdu'l-Baha who rises at four, and who had seen  eighteen people before his breakfast at half-past six.    Representatives of many languages and nationalities awaited him in the  drawing room.    We sat in a circle facing 'Abdu'l-Baha who inquired if there were any  questions we would like to ask. I said my editor had sent me to ascertain  something of his prison life, and 'Abdu'l-Baha at once related in a simple  impersonal way one of the most remarkable stories conceivable.    \"At nine years of age, I accompanied my father, Baha'u'llah, in his  journey of exile to Ba_gh_dad, seventy of his disciples going with us.  This decree of exile, after persistent persecution, was intended to  effectively stamp out of Persia what the authorities considered a  dangerous religion. Baha'u'llah, with his family and followers, was  banished, and travelled from one place to another. When I was about  twenty-five years old, we were moved from Constantinople to Adrianople,  and from there went with a guard of soldiers to the fortressed city of  Akka, where we were imprisoned and closely guarded.\"          The First Summer      \"We had no communication whatever with the out-side world. Each loaf of  bread was cut open by the guard to see that it contained no message. All  who believed in the Baha'i manifestation, children, men and women, were  imprisoned with us. There were one-hundred and fifty of us together in two  rooms and no one was allowed to leave the place with the exceptions of  four persons, who went to the bazaar to market each morning, under guard.  The first summer was dreadful. Akka is a fever-ridden town. It was said  that a bird attempting to fly over it would drop dead. The food was poor  and insufficient, the water was drawn from a fever-infected well and the  climate and conditions were such, that even the natives of the town fell  ill. Many soldiers succumbed and eight out of ten of our guard died.  During the intense heat, malaria, typhoid and dysentery attacked the  prisoners, so that all, men, women and children, were sick at one time.  There were no doctors, no medicines, no proper food, and no treatment of  any kind.    \"I used to make broth for the people, and as I had much practice, I make  good broth,\" said 'Abdu'l-Baha laughingly.    At this point one of the Persians explained to me that it was on account  of 'Abdu'l-Baha's wonderful patience, helpfulness, and endurance that he  was always called \"The Master.\" One could easily feel his mastership in  his complete severance from time and place, and absolute detachment from  all that even a Turkish prison could inflict.          Better Conditions      \"After two years of the strictest confinement permission was granted me to  find a house so that we could live outside the prison walls but still  within the fortifications. Many believers came from Persia to join us but  they were not allowed to do so. Nine years passed. Sometimes we were  better off and sometimes very much worse. It depended on the governor,  who, if he happened to be a kind and lenient ruler, would grant us  permission to leave the fortification, and would allow the believers free  access to visit the house; but when the governor was more rigorous, extra  guards were placed around us, and often pilgrims who had come from afar  were turned away.\"    I learned, afterwards, from a Persian, who, during these troublous times,  was a member of 'Abdu'l-Baha's household, that the Turkish government  could not credit the fact that the interest of the English and American  visitors was purely spiritual and not political. Often these pilgrims were  refused permission to see him, and, many times, the whole trip from  America would be rewarded merely by a glimpse of 'Abdu'l-Baha from his  prison window.    The Government thought that the tomb of the Bab, an imposing building on  Mount Carmel, was a fortification erected with the aid of American money,  and that it was being armed and garrisoned secretly. Suspicion grew with  each new arrival, resulting in extra spies and guards.          'Abdu'l-Hamid's Committee      \"One year before 'Abdu'l-Hamid was dethroned, he sent an extremely  overbearing, treacherous and insulting committee of investigation. The  chairman was one of the governor's staff, Arif Bey, and with him were  three army commanders varying in rank.    \"Immediately upon his arrival, Arif Bey proceeded to denounce me and tried  to get proof strong enough to warrant sending me to Fizan, or throwing me  into the sea. Fizan is a caravan station on the boundary of Tripoli where  there are no houses and no water. It is a month's journey by camel route  from Akka.    \"The committee twice sent for me to hear what I had to say in my own  defence and twice I sent back word: 'I know your purpose, I have nothing  to say.'    \"This so infuriated Arif Bey that he declared he would return to  Constantinople and bring back an order from the Sultan to have me hanged  at the gate of Akka. He and his committee set sail with their report  containing the following accusations:--'Abdu'l-Baha is establishing a new  nation of which he is to be the king; 'Abdu'l-Baha is uplifting the banner  of a new religion; 'Abdu'l-Baha has built or caused to be built  fortifications in Haifa, a neighbouring village, and is buying up all the  surrounding lands.'    \"About this time an Italian ship appeared in the harbour sent by order of  the Italian Consul. It had been planned that I was to escape on it by  night. The Baha'is in Akka implored me to go but I sent this message to  the captain: 'The Bab did not run away: Baha'u'llah did not run away; I  shall not run away, so the ship sailed away after waiting three days and  three nights.    \"It was while the Sultan's committee of investigation was homeward bound  that the first shell was dropped into 'Abdu'l-Hamid's camp and the first  gun of freedom was fired into the home of despotism. That was God's gun,\"  said 'Abdu'l-Baha, with one of his wonderful smiles.    \"When the committee reached the Turkish capital, they had more urgent  things to think of. The city was in a state of uproar and rebellion, and  the committee, as members of the government staff, were delegated to  investigate the insurrection. Meanwhile the people were establishing a  constitutional government and 'Abdu'l-Hamid was given no chance to act.\"          The Release      \"With the advent of the Young Turks' supremacy, realized through the  Society of Union and Progress, all the political prisoners of the Ottoman  Empire were set free. Events took the chains from my neck and placed them  about Hamid's; 'Abdu'l-Baha came out of prison and 'Abdu'l-Hamid went in!\"    \"What became of the committee?\" asked someone, breaking the deep silence  that followed the recital of this thrilling page of history. \"Arif Bey,\"  continued 'Abdu'l-Baha, \"was shot with three bullets, the general was  exiled, the next in rank died, and the third ran away to Cairo, where he  sought and received help from the Baha'is.\"    \"Will you tell us how you felt while in prison and how you regard your  freedom?\" I asked. \"We are glad that you are free.\"    \"Thank you,\" he said graciously, and continuing--    \"Freedom is not a matter of place. It is a condition. I was thankful for  the prison, and the lack of liberty was very pleasing to me, for those  days were passed in the path of service, under the utmost difficulties and  trials, bearing fruits and results.    \"Unless one accepts dire vicissitudes, he will not attain. To me prison is  freedom, troubles rest me, death is life, and to be despised is honour.  Therefore, I was happy all that time in prison. When one is released from  the prison of self, that is indeed release, for that is the greater  prison. When this release takes place, then one cannot be outwardly  imprisoned. When they put my feet in stocks, I would say to the guard,  'You cannot imprison me, for here I have light and air and bread and  water. There will come a time when my body will be in the ground, and I  shall have neither light nor air nor food nor water, but even then I shall  not be imprisoned.' The afflictions which come to humanity sometimes tend  to centre the consciousness upon the limitations, and this is a veritable  prison. Release comes by making of the will a Door through which the  confirmations of the Spirit come.\"    This sounded so like the old theology that the modern in me rose doubting  if the discipline could be compensated for by the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19251"],[0,"Arohanui: Letters from Shoghi Effendi to New Zealand (#13)"],[1,"ndeavours,  guide every step you take, and bless every effort you exert, for the  promotion of the interests of His Faith,_    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (69) September 9th, 1957      National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of New Zealand.

Can you prepare a list showing the number of Tribes that have been  contacted, and of these Tribes, the number who have become Believers. This  would be very interesting information.    Can you secure it at an early date and send it on to the Beloved Guardian.    With loving Baha'i Greetings, I am Faithfully yours, Leroy Ioas            PART V  TELEGRAMS TO NEW ZEALAND.

SHOGHI            PART VI  STATEMENTS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS.      These statements extracted from letters to individuals are not found  elsewhere in this compilation and are taken from letters written by the  Guardian's secretaries at his specific direction. The arrangement is  according to subject matter.          ALCOHOL (74)      You had asked in connection with the subject of prohibition. Of course in  every country one must take into consideration the exact conditions as to  whether by force of legislation people can be stopped from drinking, but  as a principle the Baha'i teachings are quite against drinking  intoxicating liquors and from the Baha'i point of view every thing that  helps to stop drinking is welcome.    (Extract, letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, December 30th, 1925)          EVOLUTION (75)      We cannot prove man was always man for this is a fundamental doctrine, but  it is based on the assertion that nothing can exceed its own  potentialities, that everything, a stone, a tree, an animal and a human  being existed in plan, potentially, from the very \"beginning\" of creation.  We don't believe man has always had the form of man, but rather that from  the outset he was going to evolve into the human form and species and not  be a haphazard branch of the ape family.    You see our whole approach to each matter is based on the belief that God  sends us divinely inspired Educators; what they tell us is fundamentally  true, what science tells us today is true; tomorrow may be entirely  changed to better explain a new set of facts.    When 'Abdu'l-Baha says man breaks the laws of nature, He means we shape  nature to meet our own needs, as no animal does. Animals adapt themselves  to better fit in with and benefit from their environment. But men both  surmount and change environment. Likewise when He says nature is devoid of  memory He means memory as we have it, not the strange memory of inherited  habits which animals so strikingly possess.    These various statements must be taken in conjunction with all the Baha'i  teachings; we cannot get a correct picture by concentrating on just one  phrase.    (Extract, letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, June 7th, 1946          \"HERALD OF THE SOUTH\"--(76)      Persevere I shall pray from all my heart for the steady development and  the growing influence of the \"Herald of the South\". May its voice grow in  strength and power, and may its pages increasingly reflect the dynamic  spirit of the Faith and mirror forth the ever-expanding activities of the  friends in Australasia as well as in distant lands. Persevere in your  efforts, let not obstacles damp your zeal and determination and rest  assured that the Power of God which is reinforcing your efforts will in  the end triumph and enable you to fulfil your cherished desire.    (Extract, undated letter by Shoghi Effendi)          \"HERALD OF THE SOUTH\"--(77)      Effective teaching medium. ...Regarding the \"Herald of the South\"  magazine, Shoghi Effendi very much appreciates the fact that in spite of  the many difficulties that your Assembly had to overcome this review is  being regularly published, and that its standard is gradually improving.  He would call upon all the English-speaking friends to contribute, as  often as they can, such articles for publication in that magazine as would  serve to make it a more direct and effective teaching medium for the  spread of the Cause throughout Australia and New-Zealand. He is advising  the American N. S. A. to specially ask the cooperation of the American  believers for that purpose, and hopes that the response they will make to  this call will be such as to further encourage you in your splendid  efforts for the publication of this national organ of the Faith....    (Extract, ibid., pp. 12, 13, dated April 15th, 1936)          \"HERALD OF THE SOUTH\"--(78)      Difficulties. ...The Guardian, while fully aware of the difficulties, both  financial and otherwise which your N. S. A.(9) is facing in connection  with the publication of the \"Herald of the South\", feels nevertheless the  urge to advise you to continue with this magazine and not to feel in the  least discouraged if your efforts for meeting the expenses incurred for  its printing and circulation, and for raising its literary standard, do  not bring the expected results. He very deeply values the self-sacrificing  and sustained efforts exerted by your Assembly in this connection. May  Baha'u'llah richly reward you for all your meritorious endeavours....    (Extract, ibid., p. 16, dated September 23rd, 1936)          \"HERALD OF THE SOUTH\"--(79)      Psychic practices.    ...In connection with the article published in the October number of the  \"Herald of the South\" entitled \"Above the Mists\"; the Guardian wishes the  believers to disregard such subjects as psychic practices and phenomena,  for these besides not being authenticated by the Writings of the Founders  of the Faith, pertain mostly to the domain of conjectures. The magazines  of the \"Herald of the South\" should be devoted to the study and  presentation of those subjects that reflect the spirit of the Teachings,  and which as such are worthy of consideration by the believers. As the  national organ of the Australian and New-Zealand friends its main function  is to assist in disseminating the knowledge of the Cause, and thus develop  into an effective teaching medium. This is the goal which the editors  should have constantly in mind, and which they should endeavour to attain  through the best possible means they can devise at present....    (Extract, ibid., pp. 25, 26, dated March 30th, 1938)          PHILOSOPHERS (80)      We must not take many of 'Abdu'l-Baha's statements as dogmatic finalities,  for there are other points which when added to them round out the picture.  For instance, when He calls Aristotle and Plato Philosophers of the East,  He is obviously placing them in that category because He believes they  belong more correctly to Eastern culture than to Central European and the  New World cultures of the West. When He calls the philosophers of the West  materialistic this does not for a moment mean He includes all Western  philosophers for, as you truly point out, many of them have been very  spiritual in their concepts....    Historians cannot be sure Socrates did not visit the Holy Land. But  believing as we do that 'Abdu'l-Baha had an intuitive knowledge quite  different from our own, we accept His authority on this matter....    The Guardian hopes this will better enable you to understand our wonderful  Faith--for a living religion it is, and not merely a philosophy!    (Extract, letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, June 7th, 1946)          SCOUTING (81)      As to the Scout movement, they afford a great disciplinary lesson to the  young boys and girls provided they are not prepared directly for the army.  In some towns here we have in some of the schools Scout troops who are  also students of the Colleges and it has proved to be a great educational  scheme for helping the development of the children but they are never  taught to carry arms or even the use of firearms. And furthermore they are  often taught the evils of war rather than encourage them to become in  future active soldiers with imperialistic designs. This of course is my  own personal view.    (Extract, letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, December 30th, 1925)          SOUL, MIND AND SPIRIT (82)      When studying at present, in English, the available Baha'i writings on the  subject of body, soul and spirit, one is handicapped by a certain lack of  clarity because not all were translated by the same person, and also there  are, as you know, still many Baha'i writings untranslated. But there is no  doubt that spirit and soul seem to have been interchanged in meaning  sometimes; soul and mind have, likewise, been interchanged in meaning, no  doubt due to difficulties arising from different translations. What the  Baha'is do believe though is that we have three aspects of our humanness,  so to speak, a body, a mind and an immortal identity--soul or spirit. We  believe the mind forms a link between the soul and the body, and the two  interact on each other.    (Extract, letter written on behalf of Shoghi "]]]
