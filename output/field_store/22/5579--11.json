And then I had handed  to me by Mr. J., one of the commercial gentlemen, a private letter from  Rio Janeiro, which had been lent him. After these delays, with full  materials, I sprang to work--read, read, read; wonder, wonder, wonder;  guess, guess, guess; scratch, scratch, scratch; and scribble, scribble,  scribble, make the only transcript I can give of the operations which  followed. At first, several of the other gentlemen in the room sat  around me; but soon Mr. C., having settled the deaths and marriages, and  the police and municipal reporters immediately after him, screwed out  their lamps and went home; then the editor himself, then the legislative  reporters, then the commercial editors, then the ship-news conductor,  and left me alone.    I envied them that they got through so much earlier than usual, but  scratched on, only interrupted by the compositors coming in for the  pages of my copy as I finished them; and finally, having made my last  translation from the last _Boletin Extraordinario_, sprang up, shouting,  \"Now for Mrs. P.'s,\" and looked at my watch. It was half past one![G] I  thought of course it had stopped,--no; and my last manuscript page was  numbered twenty-eight! Had I been writing there five hours? Yes!    Reader, when you are an editor, with a continent's explosions to  describe, you will understand how one may be unconscious of the passage  of time.    I walked home, sad at heart. There was no light in all Mr. Wentworth's  house; there was none in any of Mrs. Pollexfen's windows;[H] and the  last carriage of her last relation had left her door. I stumbled up  stairs in the dark, and threw myself on my bed. What should I say, what  could I say, to Julia? Thus pondering, I fell asleep.    If I were writing a novel, I should say that, at a late hour the next  day, I listlessly drew aside the azure curtains of my couch, and  languidly rang a silver bell which stood on my dressing-table, and  received from a page dressed in an Oriental costume the notes and  letters which had been left for me since morning, and the newspapers of  the day.    I am not writing a novel.    The next morning, about ten o'clock, I arose and went down to  breakfast. As I sat at the littered table which every one else had left,  dreading to attack my cold coffee and toast, I caught sight of the  morning papers, and received some little consolation from them. There  was the Argus with its three columns and a half of \"Important from South  America,\" while none of the other papers had a square of any  intelligibility excepting what they had copied from the Argus the day  before. I felt a grim smile creeping over my face as I observed this  signal triumph of our paper, and ventured to take a sip of the black  broth as I glanced down my own article to see if there were any glaring  misprints in it. Before I took the second sip, however, a loud peal at  the door-bell announced a stranger, and, immediately after, a note was  brought in for me which I knew was in Julia's hand-writing.        \"DEAR GEORGE:--Don't be angry; it was not my fault, really it was      not. Grandfather came home just as I was leaving last night, and      was so angry, and said I should not go to the party, and I had to      sit with him all the evening. Do write to me or let me see you; do      something--\"    What a load that note took off my mind! And yet, what must the poor girl  have suffered! Could the old man suspect? Singleton was true to me as  steel, I knew. He could not have whispered,--nor Barry; out that Jane,  Barry's wife. O woman! woman! what newsmongers they are! Here were Julia  and I, made miserable for life, perhaps, merely that Jane Barry might  have a good story to tell. What right had Barry to a wife? Not four  years out of college, and hardly settled in his parish. To think that I  had been fool enough to trust even him with the particulars of my  all-important secret! But here I was again interrupted, coffee-cup still  full, toast still untasted, by another missive.        \"Tuesday morning.        \"SIR:--I wish to see you this morning. Will you call upon me, or      appoint a time and place where I may meet you?        \"Yours, JEDEDIAH WENTWORTH.\"        \"Send word by the bearer.\"    \"Tell Mr. Wentworth I will call at his house at eleven o'clock.\"    The cat was certainly out; Mrs. Barry had told, or some one else had,  who I did not know and hardly cared. The scene was to come now, and I  was almost glad of it. Poor Julia! what a time she must have had with  the old bear!           *       *       *       *       *    At eleven o'clock I was ushered into Mr. Wentworth's sitting-room. Julia  was there, but before I had even spoken to her the old gentleman came  bustling across the room, with his \"Mr. Hackmatack, I suppose\"; and  then followed a formal introduction between me and her, which both of us  bore with the most praiseworthy fortitude and composure, neither  evincing, even by a glance, that we had ever seen or heard of each other  before. Here was another weight off my mind and Julia's. I had wronged  poor Mrs. Barry. The secret was not out--what could he want? It very  soon appeared.    After a minute's discussion of the weather, the snow, and the  thermometer, the old gentleman drew up his chair to mine, with \"I think,  sir, you are connected with the Argus office?\"    \"Yes, sir; I am its South American editor.'    \"Yes!\" roared the old man, in a sudden rage. \"Sir, I wish South America  was sunk in the depths of the sea!\"    \"I am sure I do, sir,\" replied I, glancing at Julia, who did not,  however, understand me. I had not fully passed out of my last night's  distress.    My sympathizing zeal soothed the old gentleman a little, and he said  more coolly, in an undertone: \"Well, sir, you are well informed, no  doubt; tell me, in strict secrecy, sir, between you and me, do you--do  you place full credit--entire confidence in the intelligence in this  morning's paper?\"    \"Excuse me, sir; what paper do you allude to? Ah! the Argus, I see.  Certainly, sir; I have not the least doubt that it is perfectly  correct.\"    \"No doubt, sir! Do you mean to insult me?--Julia, I told you so; he  says there is no doubt it is true. Tell me again there is some mistake,  will you?\" The poor girl had been trying to soothe him with the constant  remark of uninformed people, that the newspapers are always in the  wrong. He turned from her, and rose from his chair in a positive rage.  She was half crying. I never saw her more distressed. What did all this  mean? Were one, two, or all of us crazy?    It soon appeared. After pacing the length of the room once or twice,  Wentworth came up to me again, and, attempting to appear cool, said  between his closed lips: \"Do you say you have no doubt that Rio Janeiro  is strictly blockaded?\"    \"Not the slightest in the world,\" said I, trying to seem unconcerned.    \"Not the slightest, sir? What are you so impudent and cool about it for?  Do you think you are talking of the opening of a rose-bud or the death  of a mosquito? Have you no sympathy with the sufferings of a  fellow-creature? Why, sir!\" and the old man's teeth chattered as he  spoke, \"I have five cargoes of flour on their way to Rio, and their  captains will--Damn it, sir, I shall lose the whole venture.\"    The secret was out. The old fool had been sending flour to Rio, knowing  as little of the state of affairs there as a child.    \"And do you really mean, sir,\" continued the old man, \"that there is an  embargo in force in Monte Video?\"    \"Certainly, sir; but I'm very sorry for it.\"    \"Sorry for it! of course you are;--and that all foreigners are sent out  of Buenos Ayres?\"    \"Undoubtedly, sir. I wish--\"    \"Who does not wish so? Why, sir, my corresponding friends there are half  across the sea by this time. I wish Rosas was in--and that the Indians  have risen near Maranham?\"    \"Undoubtedly, sir.\"    \"Undoubtedly! I tell you, sir, I have two vessels waiting for cargoes of  India-rubbers there, under a blunder-headed captain, who will do nothing  he has not been bidden to,--obey his orders if he breaks his owners. You  smile, sir? Why, I should have made thirty thousand dollars this winter,  sir, by my India-rubbers, if we had not had this devilish mild, open  weather, you and Miss Julia there have been praising so. But next winter  must be a severe one, and with those India-rubbers I should have  made--But now those Indians,--pshaw! And a revolution in Chili?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"No trade there! And in Venezuela?\"    \"Yes, sir\"    \"Yes, sir; yes, sir; yes, sir; yes, sir! Sir, I am ruined. Say 'Yes,  sir,' to that. I have thirteen vessels at this moment in the South  American trade, sir; say 'Yes, sir,' to that. Half of them will be  taken by the piratical scoundrels; say 'Yes, sir,' to that. Their  insurance will not cover them; say 'Yes, sir,' to that. The other half  will forfeit their cargoes, or sell them for next to nothing; say 'Yes,  sir,' to that. I tell you I am a ruined man, and I wish the South  America, and your daily Argus, and you--\"    Here the old gentleman's old-school breeding got the better of his rage,  and he sank down in his arm-chair, and, bursting into tears, said:  \"Excuse me, sir,--excuse me, sir,--I am too warm.\"    We all sat for a few moments in silence, but then I took my share of the  conversation. I wish you could have seen the old man's face light up  little by little, as I showed him that to a person who understood the  politics and condition of the mercurial country with which he had  ignorantly attempted to trade, his condition was not near so bad as he  thought it; that though one port was blockaded, another was opened; that  though one revolution thwarted him, a few weeks would show another which  would favor him; that the goods which, as he saw, would be worthless at  the port to which he had sent them, would be valuable elsewhere; that  the vessels which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15869"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World Volume 2 (#13)"],[1,"excursion, some of us had been of opinion that these people  were addicted to an unnatural passion, because they had endeavoured to  entice some of our men into the woods; and, in particular, I was told, that  one who had the care of Mr Forster's plant bag, had been once or twice  attempted. As the carrying of bundles, etc. is the office of the women in  this country, it had occurred to me, and I was not singular in this, that  the natives might mistake him and some others for women. My conjecture was  fully verified this day. For this man, who was one of the party, and  carried the bag as usual, following me down the hill, by the words which I  understood of the conversation of the natives, and by their actions, I was  well assured that they considered him as a female; till, by some means,  they discovered their mistake, on which they cried out, \"Erramange!  Erramange!\" \"It is a man! It is a man!\" The thing was so palpable, that  every one was obliged to acknowledge, that they had before mistaken his  sex: and that, after they were undeceived, they seemed not to have the  least notion of what we had suspected. This circumstance will shew how  liable we are to form wrong conjectures of things, among people whose  language we are ignorant of. Had it not been for this discovery, I make no  doubt that these people would have been charged with this vile custom.    In the evening I took a walk with some of the gentlemen into the country on  the other side of the harbour, where we had very different treatment from  what we had met with in the morning. The people we now visited, among whom  was our friend Paowang, being better acquainted with us, shewed a readiness  to oblige us in every thing in their power. We came to the village which  had been visited on the 9th. It consisted of about twenty houses, the most  of which need no other description than comparing them to the roof of a  thatched house in England, taken off the walls and placed on the ground.  Some were open at both ends, others partly closed with reeds, and all were  covered with palm thatch. A few of them were thirty or forty feet long, and  fourteen or sixteen broad. Besides these, they have other mean hovels,  which, I conceived, were only to sleep in. Some of these stood in a  plantation, and I was given to understand, that in one of them lay a dead  corpse. They made signs that described sleep, or death; and circumstances  pointed out the latter. Curious to see all I could, I prevailed on an  elderly man to go with me to the hut, which was separated from the others  by a reed fence, built quite round it at the distance of four or five feet.  The entrance was by a space in the fence, made so low as to admit one to  step over. The two sides and one end of the hut were closed or built up in  the same manner, and with the same materials, as the roof. The other end  had been open, but was now well closed with mats, which I could not prevail  on the man to remove, or suffer me to do it. There hung at this end of the  hut a matted bag or basket, in which was a piece of roasted yam, and some  sort of leaves, all quite fresh. I had a strong desire to see the inside of  the hut but the man was peremptory in refusing this, and even shewed an  unwillingness to permit me to look into the basket. He wore round his neck,  fastened to a string, two or three locks of human hair; and a woman present  had several about her neck. I offered something in exchange for them, but  they gave me to understand they could not part with them, as it was the  hair of the person who lay in the hut. Thus I was led to believe that these  people dispose of their dead in a manner similar to that of Otaheite. The  same custom of wearing the hair is observed by the people of that island,  and also by the New Zealanders. The former make tamau of the hair of their  deceased friends, and the latter make ear-rings and necklaces of their  teeth.    Near most of their large houses were fixed, upright in the ground, the  stems of four cocoa-nut trees, in a square position, about three feet from  each other. Some of our gentlemen who first saw them, were inclined to  believe they were thus placed on a religious account; but I was now  satisfied that it was for no other purpose but to hang cocoa-nuts on to  dry. For when I asked, as well as I could, the use of them, a man took me  to one, loaded with cocoa-nuts from the bottom to the top; and no words  could have informed me better. Their situation is well chosen for this use,  as most of their large houses are built in an open airy place, or where the  wind has a free passage, from whatever direction it blows. Near most, if  not all of them, is a large tree or two, whose spreading branches afford an  agreeable retreat from the scorching sun. This part of the island was well  cultivated, open and airy; the plantations were laid out by line, abounding  wilh plantains, sugar-canes, yams and other roots, and stocked with  fruit-trees. In our walk we met with our old friend Paowang, who, with some  others, accompanied us to the water side, and brought with them, as a  present, a few yams and cocoa-nuts.    On the 15th, having finished wooding and watering, a few hands only were on  shore making brooms, the rest being employed on board setting up the  rigging, and putting the ship in a condition for sea. Mr Forster, in his  botanical excursion this day, shot a pigeon, in the craw of which was a  wild nutmeg. He took some pains to find the tree, but his endeavours were  without success. In the evening a party of us walked to the eastern sea-shore,  in order to take the bearing of Annattom, and Erronan or Footoona.  The horizon proved so hazy that I could see neither; but one of the natives  gave me, as I afterwards found, the true direction of them. We observed  that in all, or most of their sugar plantations, were dug holes or pits,  four feet deep, and five or six in diameter; and on our enquiring their  use, we were given to understand that they caught rats in them. These  animals, which are very destructive to the canes, are here in great plenty.  The canes, I observed, were planted as thick as possible round the edge of  these pits, so that the rats in coming at them are the more liable to  tumble in.    Next morning we found the tiller sprung in the rudder head, and, by some  strange neglect, we had not a spare one on board, which we were ignorant of  till now it was wanting. I knew but of one tree in the neighbourhood fit  for this purpose, which I sent the carpenter on shore to look at, and an  officer, with a party of men, to cut it down, provided he could obtain  leave of the natives; if not, he was ordered to acquaint me. He understood  that no one had any objection, and set the people to work accordingly. But  as the tree was large, this required some time; and, before it was down,  word was brought me that our friend Paowang was not pleased. Upon this I  gave orders to desist, as we found that, by scarfing a piece to the inner  end of the tiller, and letting it farther into the rudder-head, it would  still perform its office. But as it was necessary to have a spare one on  board, I went on shore, sent for Paowang, made him a present of a dog and a  piece of cloth, and then explained to him that our great steering paddle  was broken, and that I wanted that tree to make a new one. It was easy to  see how well pleased every one present was, with the means I took to obtain  it. With one voice they gave their consent, Paowang joining his also, which  he perhaps could not have done without the others; for I do not know that  he had either more property, or more authority, than the rest. This point  being obtained, I took our friend on board to dinner, and after it was  over, went with him ashore, to pay a visit to an old chief, who was said to  be king of the island; which was a doubt with me. Paowang took little or no  notice of him. I made him a present, after which he immediately went away,  as if he got all he came for. His name was Geogy, and they gave him the  title of Areeke. He was very old, but had a merry open countenance. He wore  round his waist a broad red-and-white chequered belt, the materials and  manufacture of which seemed the same as that of Otaheite cloth; but this  was hardly a mark of distinction. He had with him a son, not less than  forty-five or fifty years of age. A great number of people were at this  time at the landing-place, most of them from distant parts. The behaviour  of many was friendly; while others were daring and insolent, which I  thought proper to put up with, as our stay was nearly at an end.    On the 17th, about ten o'clock, I went ashore, and found in the crowd old  Geogy and his son, who soon made me understand that they wanted to dine  with me; and accordingly I brought them and two more on board. They all  called them Areekees (or kings); but I doubt if any of them had the least  pretensions to that title over the whole island. It had been remarked, that  one of these kings had not authority enough to order one of the people up  into a cocoa-nut tree, to bring him down some nuts. Although he spoke to  several, he was at last obliged to go himself, and, by way of revenge, as  it was thought, left not a nut on the tree, taking what he wanted himself,  and giving the rest to some of our people.    When I got them on board, I went with them all over the ship, which they  viewed with uncommon surprise and attention. We happened to have for their  entertainment a kind of pie or pudding made of plantains, and some sort of  greens which we had got from one of the natives. On this and on yams they  made a hearty dinner; for, as to the salt beef and pork, they would hardly  taste them. In the afternoon, having made each of them a present of a  hatchet, a spike-nail, and some medals, I conducted them ashore.    Mr Forster and I then went over to the other side of the harbour, and,  having tried, with"]]]
