The idea of identifying the pagan deities,  especially the most distinguished of them, with the manifestation of  demoniac power, and concluding that the descent of our Saviour struck  them with silence, so nobly expressed in the poetry of Milton, is not  certainly to be lightly rejected. It has been asserted, in simple prose,  by authorities of no mean weight; nor does there appear anything  inconsistent in the faith of those who, believing that, in the elder  time, fiends and demons were permitted an enlarged degree of power in  uttering predictions, may also give credit to the proposition, that at  the Divine Advent that power was restrained, the oracles silenced, and  those demons who had aped the Divinity of the place were driven from  their abode on earth, honoured as it was by a guest so awful.    It must be noticed, however, that this great event had not the same  effect on that peculiar class of fiends who were permitted to vex  mortals by the alienation of their minds, and the abuse of their  persons, in the case of what is called Demoniacal possession. In what  exact sense we should understand this word _possession_ it is impossible  to discover; but we feel it impossible to doubt (notwithstanding learned  authorities to the contrary) that it was a dreadful disorder, of a kind  not merely natural; and may be pretty well assured that it was suffered  to continue after the Incarnation, because the miracles effected by our  Saviour and his apostles, in curing those tormented in this way,  afforded the most direct proofs of his divine mission, even out of the  very mouths of those ejected fiends, the most malignant enemies of a  power to which they dared not refuse homage and obedience. And here is  an additional proof that witchcraft, in its ordinary and popular sense,  was unknown at that period; although cases of possession are repeatedly  mentioned in the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles, yet in no one  instance do the devils ejected mention a witch or sorcerer, or plead the  commands of such a person, as the cause of occupying or tormenting the  victim;--whereas, in a great proportion of those melancholy cases of  witchcraft with which the records of later times abound, the stress of  the evidence is rested on the declaration of the possessed, or the demon  within him, that some old man or woman in the neighbourhood had  compelled the fiend to be the instrument of evil.    It must also be admitted that in another most remarkable respect, the  power of the Enemy of mankind was rather enlarged than bridled or  restrained, in consequence of the Saviour coming upon earth. It is  indisputable that, in order that Jesus might have his share in every  species of delusion and persecution which the fallen race of Adam is  heir to, he personally suffered the temptation in the wilderness at the  hand of Satan, whom, without resorting to his divine power, he drove,  confuted, silenced, and shamed, from his presence. But it appears, that  although Satan was allowed, upon this memorable occasion, to come on  earth with great power, the permission was given expressly because his  time was short.    The indulgence which was then granted to him in a case so unique and  peculiar soon passed over and was utterly restrained. It is evident  that, after the lapse of the period during which it pleased the Almighty  to establish His own Church by miraculous displays of power, it could  not consist with his kindness and wisdom to leave the enemy in the  possession of the privilege of deluding men by imaginary miracles  calculated for the perversion of that faith which real miracles were no  longer present to support. There would, we presume to say, be a shocking  inconsistency in supposing that false and deceitful prophecies and  portents should be freely circulated by any demoniacal influence,  deceiving men's bodily organs, abusing their minds, and perverting their  faith, while the true religion was left by its great Author devoid of  every supernatural sign and token which, in the time of its Founder and  His immediate disciples, attested and celebrated their inappreciable  mission. Such a permission on the part of the Supreme Being would be (to  speak under the deepest reverence) an abandonment of His chosen people,  ransomed at such a price, to the snares of an enemy from whom the worst  evils were to be apprehended. Nor would it consist with the remarkable  promise in holy writ, that \"God will not suffer His people to be tempted  above what they are able to bear.\" I Cor. X. 13. The Fathers of the  Faith are not strictly agreed at what period the miraculous power was  withdrawn from the Church; but few Protestants are disposed to bring it  down beneath the accession of Constantine, when the Christian religion  was fully established in supremacy. The Roman Catholics, indeed, boldly  affirm that the power of miraculous interference with the course of  Nature is still in being; but the enlightened even of this faith, though  they dare not deny a fundamental tenet of their church, will hardly  assent to any particular case, without nearly the same evidence which  might conquer the incredulity of their neighbours the Protestants. It is  alike inconsistent with the common sense of either that fiends should be  permitted to work marvels which are no longer exhibited on the part of  Heaven, or in behalf of religion.    It will be observed that we have not been anxious to decide upon the  limits of probability on this question. It is not necessary for us to  ascertain in what degree the power of Satan was at liberty to display  itself during the Jewish dispensation, or down to what precise period in  the history of the Christian Church cures of demoniacal possession or  similar displays of miraculous power may have occurred. We have avoided  controversy on that head, because it comprehends questions not more  doubtful than unedifying. Little benefit could arise from attaining the  exact knowledge of the manner in which the apostate Jews practised  unlawful charms or auguries. After their conquest and dispersion they  were remarked among the Romans for such superstitious practices; and the  like, for What we know, may continue to linger among the benighted  wanderers of their race at the present day. But all these things are  extraneous to our enquiry, the purpose of which was to discover whether  any real evidence could be derived from sacred history to prove the  early existence of that branch of demonology which has been the object,  in comparatively modern times, of criminal prosecution and capital  punishment. We have already alluded to this as the contract of  witchcraft, in which, as the term was understood in the Middle Ages, the  demon and the witch or wizard combined their various powers of doing  harm to inflict calamities upon the person and property, the fortune and  the fame, of innocent human beings, imposing the most horrible diseases,  and death itself, as marks of their slightest ill-will; transforming  their own persons and those of others at their pleasure; raising  tempests to ravage the crops of their enemies, or carrying them home to  their own garners; annihilating or transferring to their own dairies the  produce of herds; spreading pestilence among cattle, infecting and  blighting children; and, in a word, doing more evil than the heart of  man might be supposed capable of conceiving, by means far beyond mere  human power to accomplish. If it could be supposed that such unnatural  leagues existed, and that there were wretches wicked enough, merely for  the gratification of malignant spite or the enjoyment of some beastly  revelry, to become the wretched slaves of infernal spirits, most just  and equitable would be those laws which cut them off from the midst of  every Christian commonwealth. But it is still more just and equitable,  before punishment be inflicted for any crime, to prove that there is a  possibility of that crime being committed. We have therefore advanced an  important step in our enquiry when we have ascertained that the _witch_  of the Old Testament was not capable of anything beyond the  administration of baleful drugs or the practising of paltry imposture;  in other words, that she did not hold the character ascribed to a modern  sorceress. We have thus removed out of the argument the startling  objection that, in denying the existence of witchcraft, we deny the  possibility of a crime which was declared capital in the Mosaic law, and  are left at full liberty to adopt the opinion, that the more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14466"],[0,"South African Memories (#13)"],[1,"hen, turning to the engine-driver,  \"Go straight ahead.\" Here was a conspicuous instance of English  foolhardy pluck.    The evening was a lovely one. I took a walk along the road by which we  had come in the morning, and was soothed by the peaceful serenity of the  surrounding country.    It seemed to be impossible that men were killing each other only a few  short miles away. The herd of cattle we had passed came into view, and  caught sight of the water in the dam. It was curious to see the whole  herd, some five or six hundred beasts, break into a clumsy canter, and,  with a bellowing noise, dash helter-skelter to the water--big oxen with  huge branching horns, meek-eyed cows, young bullocks, and tiny calves,  all joining in the rush for a welcome drink after a long hot day on the  veldt.    The last news that came in that evening was that all the wires were cut  north and south of Mafeking, and the telegraphists fled, as their lives  had been threatened.

CHAPTER VII         IN A REBELLIOUS COLONY--VISIT TO VRYBURG DURING THE BOER       OCCUPATION--I PASS OFF AS A DUTCHMAN'S SISTER         \"The days are so long, and there are so many of them.\"                                                   DU MAURIER.      During the weeks I remained at Mosita, the only book I had to read was  \"Trilby,\" which I perused many times, and the lament of the heroine in  the line quoted above seemed to re-echo my sentiments. For days and days  we were absolutely without news. It is impossible after a lapse of time  to realize exactly what that short sentence really means. I must ask my  readers to remember that we talked and thought of one topic only; we  looked incessantly in the one direction by which messengers might come.  Our nerves were so strained that, did we but see one of the natives  running across the yard, or hear them conversing in louder tones than  usual, we at once thought there must be news, and jumped up from any  occupation with which we were trying to beguile the time, only to sink  back on our chairs again disappointed. As for knowing what was passing  in the world, one might as well have been in another planet. We saw no  papers, and there was not much prospect of obtaining any. Before the war  we had all talked lightly of wires being cut and railway-lines pulled  up, but, in truth, I do not think anyone realized what these two  calamities really meant. My only comfort was the reflection that, no  matter how hard they were fighting in Mafeking, they could not be  suffering the terrible boredom that we were enduring. To such an extent  in this monotony did I lose the count of time, that I had to look in the  almanack to be able to say, in Biblical language, \"The evening and the  morning were the sixth day.\"    At length one evening, when we were sitting on the stoep after supper,  we descried a rider approaching on a very tired horse. Rushing to the  gate, we were handed letters from Mafeking. It can be imagined how we  devoured them. They told of three determined attacks on the town on the  third day after I had left, all successfully repulsed, and of a  bombardment on the following Monday. The latter had been somewhat of a  farce, and had done no damage, except to one or two buildings which, by  an irony of fate, included the Dutch church and hotel and the convent.  The shells were of such poor quality that they were incapable of any  explosive force whatever.[26] After nine hours' bombardment, although  some narrow escapes were recorded, the only casualties were one chicken  killed and one dog wounded. An emissary from Commandant Snyman had then  come solemnly into the town under a flag of truce, to demand an  unconditional surrender \"to avoid further bloodshed.\" Colonel  Baden-Powell politely replied that, as far as he was concerned,  operations had not begun. The messenger was given refreshment at Dixon's  Hotel, where lunch was laid out as usual. This had astonished him  considerably, as presumably he had expected to find but few survivors.  He was then sent about his business. Gordon, who imagined me at  Setlagoli, concluded his letter by saying the Colonel had informed  General Cronje of my presence at Mrs. Fraser's, and begged him to leave  me unmolested. This news, which had come by a _Daily Mail_  correspondent, on his way South to send off cables, was satisfactory as  far as it went, and we at once despatched a trusty old nigger called  Boaz with a tiny note, folded microscopically in an old cartridge-case,  to give the garrison news of the surrounding country. This old man  proved a reliable and successful messenger. On many occasions he  penetrated the cordon into the beleaguered town, and during the first  two months he was practically the sole means they had of receiving  news. His task was of course a risky one, and we used to pay him L3 each  way, but he never failed us.    Now commenced a fresh period of anxious waiting, and during this time I  had leisure and opportunity to study the characteristics of these Boer  farmers and their wives, and to learn what a curious race they are. Mrs.  Keeley told me a great deal of their ideas, habits, and ways, in which  low cunning is combined with extreme curiosity and naive simplicity.  Many of the fathers and sons in the neighbourhood had slunk off to fight  across the border, sending meanwhile their wives and daughters to call  on Mrs. Keeley and condole with her in what they termed \"her trouble,\"  and to ascertain at the same time all the circumstances of the farm and  domestic circle. A curious thing happened one day. Directly after  breakfast an old shandrydan drove up with a typical Dutch family as  occupants. Mrs. Keeley, busy with household matters, pulled a long face,  knowing what was before her. No questions as to being at home,  disengaged, or follies of that sort, were asked; the horses were  solemnly outspanned and allowed to roam; the family party had come to  spend the day. Seated gravely in the dining-room, they were refreshed by  coffee and cold meat. Mrs. Keeley remarked to me privately that the best  thing to do was to put quantities of food before them and then leave  them; and, beyond a few passing words as she went in and out of the  room, I did not make out that they went in for entertaining each other.  So they sat for hours, saying nothing, doing nothing. When Mrs. Keeley  wanted me to have lunch, she asked them to remove to the stoep, and in  this request they seemed to find nothing strange. Finally, about five  o'clock they went away, much to the relief of their hostess; not,  however, before the latter had shrewdly guessed the real object of their  visit, which was to find out about myself. Report had reached them that  Mafeking was in the hands of the Dutch, that the only survivor of the  garrison had escaped in woman's clothes, had been wandering on the veldt  for days, and had finally been taken in here. \"Ach!\" said the old  _vrow_, \"I would be afraid to meet him. Is he really here?\" This remark  she made to Mrs. Keeley's brother, who could hardly conceal his  amusement, but, to reassure her, displayed the cart and mules by which I  had come. If in England we had heard of the arrival of a \"unicorn\" in an  aeroplane, we should not have shown more anxiety or taken more trouble  to hear about the strange creature than did they concerning myself.  Their curiosity did not end here. What was Mr. Keeley doing in Mafeking?  Was he fighting for the English? How many head of cattle had they on  the farm? And so on _ad libitum_. Mrs. Keeley, however, knew her friends  well, and was quite capable of dealing with them, so they probably spent  an unprofitable day.    On another occasion an English farmer named Leipner looked in, and gave  us some information about Vryburg. This town was absolutely undefended,  and was occupied by the Boers without a shot being fired. The ceremony  of the hoisting of the _Vierkleur_[27] had been attended by the whole  countryside, and had taken place with much psalm-singing and praying,  interlarded with bragging and boasting. He told me also that some of the  rumours current in the town, and firmly credited, reported that Oom Paul  had annexed Bechuanaland, that he was then about to take Cape Colony,  after which he would allow no troops to land, and the \"Roineks\" would  have been pushed into the sea. His next step would be to take England.  Mr. Leipner assured me the more ignorant Boers had not an idea where  England was situated, nor did they know that a great ocean rolled  between it and this continent. In fact, they gloried in their want of  knowledge, and were insulted if they received a letter in any tongue but  their own. He related one tale to illustrate their ignorance: An old  burgher and his _vrow_ were sitting at home one Sunday afternoon.  Seeing the \"predicant\"[28] coming, the old man hastily opened his Bible  and began to read at random. The clergyman came in, and, looking over  his shoulder, said: \"Ah! I see you are reading in the Holy Book--the  death of Christ.\" \"Alle machter!\" said the old lady. \"Is He dead indeed?  You see, Jan\" (to her husband) \"you never will buy a newspaper, so we  never know what goes on in the world.\" Mr. Leipner said this story loses  in being told in English instead of in the"]]]
