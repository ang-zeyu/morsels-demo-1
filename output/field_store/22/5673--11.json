Now about the football game. Bring your girls along  and I'll do my best to give them a good time, although I'm generally  anything but a success with new girls. However, Hippy makes up for what  I lack. He can entertain a regiment of them, and not even exert himself.  Now I must leave you, for I have a very important engagement at home.\"    \"In the laboratory, I suppose,\" said Anne teasingly.    \"Just so,\" replied David. \"Good-bye, girls. Let me know how many tickets  you want for the game.\" He raised his cap, mounted his machine and was  off down the street.    \"It will seem good to have a frolic with the boys again, won't it?\" said  Grace to Anne as they strolled along.    \"We do seem to be getting awfully serious and settled of late,\" replied  Anne. \"Why, this sorority business has taken up all our spare time  lately. We've had so many special meetings.\"    \"I know it,\" replied Grace, \"but after Thanksgiving we'll only meet once  in two weeks, for I must get my basketball team in shape, and you see  all the members belong to the society.\"    \"You ought to do extra good work this year,\" observed Anne, \"for the  team is absolutely harmonious. Last season seems like a dream to me  now.\"    \"It was real enough then,\" replied Grace grimly. \"I have forgiven, long  ago, but I have not forgotten the way some of those girls performed last  year. It was remarkable that things ever straightened themselves. The  clouds looked black for a while, didn't they?\"    Anne pressed Grace's hand by way of answer. The sophomore year had been  crowded with many trials, some of them positive school tragedies, in  which Anne and Grace had been the principal actors.    \"What are you two mooning over?\" asked a gay voice, and the two girls  turned with a start to find Julia Crosby grinning cheerfully at them.    \"O Julia, how glad I am to see you at close range!\" exclaimed Grace.  \"Admiring you from a distance isn't a bit satisfactory.\"    \"Business, children, business,\" said Julia briskly. \"That's the only  thing that keeps me from your side. The duties of the class president  are many and irksome. At the present moment I've a duty on hand that  I don't in the least relish, and I want your august assistance. Will you  promise to help before I tell you?\"    \"Why, of course,\" answered Grace and Anne in the same breath. \"What is  it you want us to do?\"    \"Well, it seems that some of your juniors are still in need of  discipline. You remember the hatchet that we buried last year with such  pomp and ceremony?\"    \"Yes, yes,\" was the answer.    \"This morning I overheard certain girls planning to go out to the  Omnibus House after school to-morrow and dig up the poor hatchet and  flaunt it in the seniors' faces the day of the opening basketball game,  simply to rattle us. Just as though it wouldn't upset your team as much  as ours. It's an idiotic trick, at any rate, and anything but funny. Now  I propose to take four of our class, and you must select four of yours.  We'll hustle out there the minute school is over to-morrow, and be ready  to receive the marauders when they arrive. Select your girls, but don't  tell them what you want or they may tell some one about it beforehand.\"    \"Well, of all impudence!\" exclaimed Anne. \"Who are the girls, Julia? Are  you sure they're juniors?\"    \"The two I heard talking are juniors. I don't know who else is in it.  They'll be very much astonished to find us 'waiting at the  church'--Omnibus House, I mean,\" said Julia, \"and I imagine they'll feel  rather silly, too.\"    \"Tell us who they are, Julia,\" said Grace. \"We don't want to go into  this blindfolded.\"    \"Wait and see,\" replied Julia tantalizingly. \"Then you'll feel more  indignant and can help my cause along all the better. I give you my word  that the girls I overheard talking are not particular friends of yours.  You aren't going to back out, are you, and leave me without proper  support?\"    \"Of course not,\" laughed Grace. \"Don't worry. We'll support you, only  you must agree to do all the talking.\"    \"I shall endeavor to overcome their insane freshness with a few  well-chosen words,\" Julia promised. \"Be sure and be on hand early.\"    Grace chose Anne, Nora, Jessica and Marian Barber, the latter three  being considerably mystified at her request, but nevertheless agreeing  to be on hand when school closed. They were met at the gate by Julia and  four other seniors, and the whole party set out for the Omnibus House  without delay.    Grace walked with Julia, and the two girls found plenty to say to each  other during the walk. Julia was studying hard, she told Grace. She  wanted to enter Smith next year.    \"I don't know where I shall go after I finish High School,\" said Grace.  \"Ethel Post wants me to go to Wellesley. She'll be a junior when I'm a  freshman. You know, she was graduated from High School last June and she  could help me a lot in getting used to college. But I don't know  whether I should like Wellesley. I shall not try to decide where I want  to go for a while yet.\"    \"Wherever we are we'll write and always be friends,\" said Julia, and  Grace warmly acquiesced.    As they neared the old Omnibus House they could see no one about.    \"We're early!\" exclaimed Julia. \"The enemy has not arrived. Thank  goodness, it's not cold to-day or we might have a chilly vigil. Now  listen, all ye faithful, while I set forth the object of this walk.\" She  thereupon related what Grace and Anne already knew.    \"What a shame!\" cried Marian Barber. \"It isn't the hatchet we care for,  it's the principle of the thing. Give them what they deserve, Julia.\"    \"Never fear,\" replied Julia. \"I'll effectually attend to their case. Now  we'd better dodge around the corner and keep out of sight until they get  here. Then we'll swoop down upon them unawares.\"    The avengers hurriedly concealed themselves at the side of the old house  where they could not be seen by an approaching party.    They had not waited long before they heard voices.    \"They're coming,\" whispered Julia. \"There are eight of them. Form in  line and when they get nicely started, we'll circle about them and hem  them in. I'll give you the signal.\"    The girls waited in silence. \"They have trowels,\" Julia informed them  from time to time. \"They have a spade. They've begun to dig, and they  are having their own troubles, for the ground is hard. All ready!  March!\"    Softly the procession approached the spot where the marauders were  energetically digging. Grace gave a little gasp, and reaching back  caught Anne's hand.    The girl using the spade was Eleanor.    \"Now I'm in for it,\" groaned Grace. \"She's down on me now, and she'll be  sure to think I organized the whole thing.\" For an instant Grace  regretted making the promise to Julia, before learning the situation;  then, holding her head a trifle more erect, she decided to make the best  of her unfortunate predicament.    \"It isn't Julia's fault,\" she thought. \"She probably knows nothing about  our acquaintance with Eleanor; besides, Eleanor has no business to play  such tricks. Edna Wright must have told her all about last year.\"    Her reflections were cut short, for one of the girls glanced up from her  digging with a sudden exclamation which drew all eyes toward Julia and  her party.    \"Well, little folks,\" said Julia in mock surprise, \"what sort of a party  is this? Are you making mud pies or are you pretending you are at the  seashore?\"    At Julia's first words Eleanor dropped the small spade she held and  straightened up, the picture of defiance. Her glance traveled from girl  to girl, and she curled her lip contemptuously as her eye rested on  Grace and Anne. The other diggers looked sheepishly at Julia, who stood  eyeing them in a way that made them feel \"too foolish for anything,\" as  one of them afterwards expressed it.    \"Why don't you answer me, little girls?\" asked Julia. \"Has the kitty  stolen your tongue?\"    This was too much for Eleanor.    \"How dare you speak to us in that manner and treat us as though we were  children?\" she burst forth. \"What business is it of yours why we are  here? Do you own this property?\"    \"Mercy, no,\" replied Julia composedly. \"Do you?\"    \"No,\" replied Eleanor a trifle less rudely, \"but we have as much right  here as you have.\"    \"Granted,\" replied Julia calmly. \"However, there is this difference.  You are here to make mischief and we are here to prevent it, and,  furthermore, are going to do so.\"    \"What do you mean?\" retorted Eleanor, her eyes flashing.    \"Just this,\" replied Julia. \"Last year the girls belonging to the  present senior and junior classes met on this very spot and amicably  disposed of a two-year-old class grudge. Emblematic of this they buried  a hatchet, once occupying a humble though honorable position in the  Crosby family, but cheerfully sacrificed for the good of the cause.    \"Yesterday,\" continued Julia, \"I overheard two juniors plotting to get  possession of this same hatchet for the purpose of flaunting it in the  faces of the seniors at the opening basketball game. Therefore I decided  to take a hand in things, and here I am, backed by girls from both  classes, who are of the self-same mind.\"    \"Really, Miss Crosby,\" said Edna Wright, \"you are very amusing.\"    \"My friends all think so,\" returned Julia sweetly, \"but never mind now  about my amusing qualities, Edna. Let's talk about the present  situation.\"    She looked at Edna with the old-time aggravating smile that was always  warranted to further incense her opponent. It had its desired effect,  for Edna fairly bristled with indignation and was about to make a  furious reply when she was pushed aside by Eleanor, who said loftily,  \"Allow me to talk to this "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17851"],[0,"The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave (#13)"],[1,"the  ensuing twelvemonths, while she was the occasional pensioner of the  Society, I have now had the opportunity of closely observing her conduct  for fourteen months, in the situation of a domestic servant in my own  family; and the following is the deliberate opinion of Mary's character,  formed not only by myself, but also by my wife and sister-in-law, after  this ample period of observation. We have found her perfectly honest and  trustworthy in all respects; so that we have no hesitation in leaving  every thing in the house at her disposal. She had the entire charge of the  house during our absence in Scotland for three months last autumn, and  conducted herself in that charge with the utmost discretion and fidelity.  She is not, it is true, a very expert housemaid, nor capable of much hard  work, (for her constitution appears to be a good deal broken,) but she is  careful, industrious, and anxious to do her duty and to give satisfaction.  She is capable of strong attachments, and feels deep, though unobtrusive,  gratitude for real kindness shown her. She possesses considerable natural  sense, and has much quickness of observation and discrimination of  character. She is remarkable for _decency_ and _propriety_ of conduct--and  her _delicacy_, even in trifling minutiae, has been a trait of special  remark by the females of my family. This trait, which is obviously quite  unaffected, would be a most inexplicable anomaly, if her former habits had  been so indecent and depraved as Mr. Wood alleges. Her chief faults, so  far as we have discovered them, are, a somewhat violent and hasty temper,  and a considerable share of natural pride and self-importance; but these  defects have been but rarely and transiently manifested, and have scarcely  occasioned an hour's uneasiness at any time in our household. Her  religious knowledge, notwithstanding the pious care of her Moravian  instructors in Antigua, is still but very limited, and her views of  christianity indistinct; but her profession, whatever it may have of  imperfection, I am convinced, has nothing of insincerity. In short, we  consider her on the whole as respectable and well-behaved a person in her  station, as any domestic, white or black, (and we have had ample  experience of both colours,) that we have ever had in our service.    But after all, Mary's character, important though its exculpation be to  her, is not really the point of chief practical interest in this case.  Suppose all Mr. Wood's defamatory allegations to be true--suppose him to  be able to rake up against her out of the records of the Antigua police,  or from the veracious testimony of his brother colonists, twenty stories  as bad or worse than what he insinuates--suppose the whole of her own  statement to be false, and even the whole of her conduct since she came  under our observation here to be a tissue of hypocrisy;--suppose all  this--and leave the negro woman as black in character as in  complexion,[21]--yet it would affect not the main facts--which are  these.--1. Mr. Wood, not daring in England to punish this woman  arbitrarily, as he would have done in the West Indies, drove her out of  his house, or left her, at least, only the alternative of returning  instantly to Antigua, with the certainty of severe treatment there, or  submitting in silence to what she considered intolerable usage in his  household. 2. He has since obstinately persisted in refusing her  manumission, to enable her to return home in security, though repeatedly  offered more than ample compensation for her value as a slave; and this on  various frivolous pretexts, but really, and indeed not unavowedly, in  order to _punish_ her for leaving his service in England, though he  himself had professed to give her that option. These unquestionable facts  speak volumes.[22]    [Footnote 21: If it even were so, how strong a plea of palliation might not  the poor negro bring, by adducing the neglect of her various owners to  afford religious instruction or moral discipline, and the habitual  influence of their evil _example_ (to say the very least,) before her  eyes? What moral good could she possibly learn--what moral evil could she  easily escape, while under the uncontrolled power of such masters as she  describes Captain I---- and Mr. D---- of Turk's Island? All things  considered, it is indeed wonderful to find her such as she now is. But as  she has herself piously expressed it, \"that God whom then she knew not  mercifully preserved her for better things.\"]    [Footnote 22: Since the preceding pages were printed off, I have been  favoured with a communication from the Rev. J. Curtin, to whom among other  acquaintances of Mr. Wood's in this country, the entire proof sheets of  this pamphlet had been sent for inspection. Mr. Curtin corrects some  omissions and inaccuracies in Mary Prince's narrative (see page 17,) by  stating, 1. That she was baptized, not in August, but on the 6th of April,  1817; 2. That sometime before her baptism, on her being admitted a  catechumen, preparatory to that holy ordinance, she brought a note from  her owner, Mr. Wood, recommending her for religious instruction, &c.; 3.  That it was his usual practice, when any adult slaves came on _week days_  to school, to require their owners' permission for their attendance; but  that on _Sundays_ the chapel was open indiscriminately to all.--Mary,  after a personal interview with Mr. Curtin, and after hearing his letter  read by me, still maintains that Mr. Wood's note recommended her for  baptism merely, and that she never received any religious instruction  whatever from Mr. and Mrs. Wood, or from any one else at that period  beyond what she has stated in her narrative. In regard to her  non-admission to the Sunday school without permission from her owners, she  admits that she may possibly have mistaken the clergyman's meaning on that  point, but says that such was certainly her impression at the time, and  the actual cause of her non-attendance.    Mr. Curtin finds in his books some reference to Mary's connection with a  Captain ----, (the individual, I believe, alluded to by Mr. Phillips at  page 32); but he states that when she attended his chapel she was always  decently and becomingly dressed, and appeared to him to be in a situation  of trust in her mistress's family.    Mr. Curtin offers no comment on any other part of Mary's statement; but he  speaks in very favourable, though general terms of the respectability of  Mr. Wood, whom he had known for many years in Antigua; and of Mrs. Wood,  though she was not personally known to him, he says, that he had \"heard  her spoken of by those of her acquaintance, as a lady of very mild and  amiable manners.\"    Another friend of Mr. and Mrs. Wood, a lady who had been their guest both  in Antigua and England, alleges that Mary has grossly misrepresented them  in her narrative; and says that she \"can vouch for their being the most  benevolent, kind-hearted people that can possibly live.\" She has declined,  however, to furnish me with any written correction of the  misrepresentations she complains of, although I offered to insert her  testimony in behalf of her friends, if sent to me in time. And having  already kept back the publication a fortnight waiting for communications  of this sort, I will not delay it longer. Those who have withheld their  strictures have only themselves to blame.    Of the general character of Mr. and Mrs. Wood, I would not designedly give  any _unfair_ impression. Without implicitly adopting either the _ex parte_  view of Mary Prince, or the unmeasured encomiums of their friends, I am  willing to believe them to be, on the whole, fair, perhaps favourable,  specimens of colonial character. Let them even be rated, if you will, in  the very highest and most benevolent class of slave-holders; and, laying  everything else entirely out of view, let Mr. Wood's conduct in this  affair be tried exclusively by the facts established beyond dispute, and  by his own statement of the case in his letter to Mr. Taylor. But then, I  ask, if the very _best_ and _mildest_ of your slave-owners can act as Mr.  Wood is proved to have acted, what is to be expected of persons whose  mildness, or equity, or common humanity no one will dare to vouch for? If  such things are done in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?--And  what else then can Colonial Slavery possibly be, even in its best estate,  but a system incurably evil and iniquitous?--I require no other data--I  need add no further comment.]    The case affords a most instructive illustration of the true spirit of the  slave system, and of the pretensions of the slave-holders to assert, not  merely their claims to a \"vested right\" in the _labour_ of their bondmen,  but to an indefeasible property in them as their \"absolute chattels.\" It  furnishes a striking practical comment on the assertions of the West  Indians that self-interest is a sufficient check to the indulgence of  vindictive feelings in the master; for here is a case where a man (a  _respectable_ and _benevolent_ man as his friends aver,) prefers losing  entirely the full price of the slave, for the mere satisfaction of  preventing a poor black woman from returning home to her husband! If the  pleasure of thwarting the benevolent wishes of the Anti-Slavery Society in  behalf of the deserted negro, be an additional motive with Mr. Wood, it  will not much mend his wretched plea.           *       *       *       *       *    I may here add a few words respecting the earlier portion of Mary Prince's  narrative. The facts there stated must necessarily rest entirely,--since  we have no collateral evidence,--upon their intrinsic claims to  probability, and upon the reliance the reader may feel disposed, after  perusing the foregoing pages, to place on her veracity. To my judgment,  the internal evidence of the truth of her narrative appears remarkably  strong. The "]]]
