It's an ingenious idea, although not  entirely new to me.    \"The whole thing has been managed by means of the telephone--a  powerful ally of the modern criminal. Briefly what happened was this:  The Red House--selected because of its lonely position, but also  because it was fairly accessible--was leased by our missing assassin  without any personal interview taking place. We have to look then in  the first instance for some one possessing considerable financial  resources. It was by the effective substitution of a year's rent--in  cash--for the more usual references, that our man--or woman--whom I  will call 'A' secured possession of the keys and right of entry to the  premises. A limited amount of furniture was obtained in the same  manner. We haven't found the firm who supplied it, but I don't doubt  that the business was done over the telephone, cash being paid as  before. Duplicate keys must have been made for some of the doors, I  think--a simple matter. We shall find that the furnishing people as  well as the caterer who later on supplied the supper were admitted to  the Red House by a district messenger or else had the keys posted to  them for the purpose.    \"The whole business was built up around a central idea, simple in  itself: that of inveigling Sir Marcus into the prepared supper-room.  His attendance at the New Avenue Theater last night was doubtless  assured--although we may never prove it--by another of these  mysterious telephone messages, probably purporting to come from Miss  Merlin. The cold-blooded thoroughness with which 'A' arranged for a  crate to be delivered at the garage and for the body of the murdered  man to be taken to the docks and shipped to the West Indies,  illuminates the character of the person we have to seek.    \"Discovery sooner or later was inevitable, of course. It came sooner  because of the accident at the docks. Had it come later I don't doubt  that 'A' would have dismantled the Red House again so that the  investigation would have been severely handicapped. As it is, the only  dismantling done was the most important of all.\"    \"You mean?\" I said with keen interest.    \"The death-machine,\" answered Gatton. \"The cunning device around which  all these trappings were erected. We don't have to wait for the  coroner's inquest nor the pathologists' report to know that Sir Marcus  was asphyxiated.\"    \"In that room where supper was laid for two?\" I muttered.    \"Can you doubt it?\"    \"No,\" I said, \"and I don't.\"    \"I have allowed nothing to be touched,\" continued Gatton, \"and I am  going around there now to make a final attempt to unravel the mystery  of how Sir Marcus met his death.\"    \"There is one detail,\" said I, \"which it seems impossible to fit into  its proper place in the scheme. The figure of Bast painted upon the  crate--you have that at Scotland Yard--and the little image of the  goddess which was stolen from my table last night.\"    Gatton stood up, uttering a sigh.    \"I have always found, Mr. Addison,\" he replied, \"that it is these  outstanding features of a case, these pieces which don't seem to fit,  that are the most valuable clews. It's the apparently simple cases in  which there is no outstanding point that are the most baffling.\"    I laughed shortly.    \"One could not very well complain of the lack of such features in 'the  _Oritoga_ mystery,'\" I said. \"As a confrere of mine remarked when the  body of Sir Marcus was discovered in the crate, the whole thing is as  mad as 'Alice in Wonderland'!\"    Gatton presently departed for the Red House and I accompanied him, for  I was intensely curious to learn by what means the murder of Sir  Marcus had been accomplished. As I proposed later in the morning to  call on Isobel, Coates drove Gatton and myself as far as the Red House  and I instructed the man to wait for me.    Although the morning was still young, the prominence given by the  press to this sensational crime had resulted in the presence of quite  a considerable group of pilgrims who even thus early had arrived to  look upon the scene of the mysterious tragedy. London is a city of  onlookers. The most trivial street accident never lacks its interested  audience, and a house in which a murder is reputed to have taken place  becomes a center upon which the idly curious focus from the four  points of the compass.    Our arrival created a subdued excitement amongst the nondescript group  gathered upon the pavement. Despite the efforts of a constable on  duty, men, women and children persistently gathered before the gates  of the drive peering up at the empty house as if they anticipated  seeing the face of the murderer or an apparition of the victim appear  behind one of the windows. A considerable group, too, was gathered  before the garage, but as Gatton and I descended and began to walk up  the drive there was a general movement in our direction.    \"I wonder,\" said I, \"if 'A,' the wanted man, is among the crowd? One  reads that murderers are irresistibly drawn back to the scene of their  crimes.\"    \"He may be,\" replied Gatton; \"anyway there are two C.I.D. men there  for certain, so that 'A' will do well to be upon his guard.\"    A few moments later I found myself again in the lounge-hall of the Red  House; and the place now seemed to me to have taken on an air of  oppressive mystery. In the very deserted silence of the house I  detected something sinister. Of course, no doubt this was merely an  effect created upon my mind by the ghastly associations of the place;  but I know that whereas on the previous day surprise and curiosity had  been the most characteristic emotions aroused by our discoveries  there, this morning something darker seemed to have taken their place;  and I found myself listening for a sound that never came and wondering  vaguely and vainly, what secret was hidden in this desolate mansion.    By Gatton's orders the room in which that gruesome supper was laid had  been left undisturbed and once more we stood surveying the spotless  napery and sparkling silver. I listened to the ticking of the clock  upon the mantelpiece and stared dully at the wine resting in the  ice-pail which now contained nothing but dirty water. A big dish of  fruit stood upon the table, peaches and apricots and nectarines; and  several large wasps had entered through one of the windows which some  one had opened, and were buzzing sleepily around the dish.  Lastly--there beside the clock stood Isobel's photograph.    For any evidence of a struggle I looked in vain, but the nature of my  companion's investigation was more obscure. Again the whole of his  attention seemed to be directed upon the wall, the window-ledges and  the door-frame. Suddenly:    \"Ah,\" I said, \"I know what you are looking for! Some connection  between this room and the garage?\"    Gatton, who was kneeling examining a lower panel of the door, looked  up with a grim smile.    \"Perhaps I am,\" he replied.    By the tone of his voice I knew that whatever he had sought he had  failed once more to find. Presently, desisting from this quest of his,  he stood and stared curiously for some time at a recess immediately  behind one of the high-backed chairs drawn up to the supper table. We  had already explored this recess and had found it to be vacant. Gatton  advanced towards it and drew aside the curtain which was draped in the  opening.    It was a recess about four feet wide by three deep and it contained  nothing in the nature of furniture or ornament.    \"Does anything strike you as curious about this arrangement?\" said my  companion.    I looked for a long time, but failed to detect anything of a notable  nature.    \"Nothing,\" I said, \"except that it seems a peculiar idea to drape a  curtain before a recess in that way.\"    \"And such a curtain!\" said Gatton, fingering the texture.    I in turn touched the material with my fingers and found it to be an  extremely heavy velvet. Looking upward, I noticed that it was attached  to a rod set so high in the wall on either side that the top of the  drapery actually touched the ceiling.    \"Well,\" said Gatton, looking at me oddly, \"in addition to the texture  of the curtain do you notice anything else?\"    \"No,\" I confessed.    \"Well,\" he continued, \"you may remember that yesterday when I examined  this place, I had to drape the curtain over a chair, which I moved  here for the purpose, in order to see the recess.\"    \"So you did,\" I said; \"I remember.\"    \"Well, doesn't it strike you as odd? If you'll notice the way it is  fastened above, you will see that it is not upon rings. In other words  it is not intended to be opened. You see that it is in one piece so  that anybody having occasion to enter the recess would have to lift it  aside and let it fall to behind him.\"    I studied the arrangement of the drapings more closely and saw that  his statement was correct; also I saw something else, and:    \"This room has been lighted by gas at some time!\" I cried. \"Here, up  under the picture-rail, is a plug.\"    \"Most houses are provided both with gas and electric light about  here,\" replied Gatton abstractedly.    But even before he had finished speaking I saw his expression change,  and in a moment he had dragged a chair into the recess.    \"Hold the curtain back,\" he directed sharply.    Standing on the chair, he began to examine the little brass plug to  which I had drawn his attention. For some time I watched him in  silence, and then:    \"What do you think you have found?\" I inquired.    He glanced down over his shoulder.    \"I think I have found a _clew_!\" he replied.          CHAPTER X    \"HANGING EVIDENCE\"      Isobel came into the room and approached the chair from which I had  arisen. In her plain morning frock, with the sun bringing out those  wonderful russet tints in her hair, but having that frightened look  still in her eyes, she had never seemed more beautiful. Yet I saw"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15344"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Sophomore Year at High School (#13)"],[1,"d, but I guess we can stand it. We have  some friends who are loyal, at any rate.\"    \"I suppose you are right, my dear,\" responded the old lady. \"It is better  for old folks to keep their fingers out of young folk's pies. But what did  that pert miss mean about Anne's father being an actor? I had an idea he  was dead.\"    So Grace told Mrs. Gray the story of Anne's father, beginning from where  he had intercepted Anne on her way from the aeroplane exhibition during  her freshman year, up to the time of the arrival of his letter begging for  money.    \"Anne used her freshman prize money last year to help him out of trouble.  He forged a friend's name for one hundred dollars, and would have had to  go to prison had she not made good the money he took, I always wanted you  to know about it, Mrs. Gray, but Anne felt so badly over it, she begged me  never to tell any one.\"    \"Your story explains a great many things I never before understood,\" said  Mrs. Gray. \"That doll that was sent to the Christmas party last year, for  instance. But how did Miriam find out about it?\"    \"We don't know,\" said Grace. \"Her doings are dark and mysterious. Find out  she did; and she has told the story with considerable effect among the  girls.\"    \"It is too bad,\" mused Mrs. Gray. \"I should like to right matters were it  possible, but as long as you don't wish it, my dear, I suppose I must let  you fight it out by yourselves. But one thing I am sure of, Anne shall  never want for a friend as long as I live. Now run along and have a good  time. I've kept you here when you might have been dancing.\"    \"I have loved being with you,\" said Grace. \"I shall not tell Anne about  what was said,\" she added in a lower tone.    \"That is right, Grace,\" responded Mrs. Gray. \"No need of hurting the  child's feelings.\"    During the balance of the evening nothing occurred to discomfit either  Grace or Anne. To be sure there was a marked coolness exhibited by most of  their classmates, but David took charge of Anne and saw to it that nothing  disturbed her. Grace, who was a general favorite with the High School boys  of Oakdale, could have filled her programme three times over. She was the  embodiment of life and danced with such apparent unconcern that the mind  of more than one sophomore was divided as to whether to cleave to Miriam  or renew their former allegiance to Grace.    It was well after one o'clock when the \"Home, Sweet Home\" waltz sounded.  The floor was well filled with dancers, for the majority of the guests had  remained until the end of the ball. As the last strains of the music died  away the sophomores sent their class yell echoing through the gymnasium.  It was answered by the various yells of the other classes, given with true  High School fervor. Each class trying to outdo the other in the making of  noise.    Sleepy chaperons began gathering up their charges. The sophomore ball was  a thing of the past.    \"These late hours and indigestible suppers are bound to break down my  delicate constitution yet,\" Hippy confided to Nora.    \"In that case I shall make it a point to see that you don't receive any  more invitations to our parties,\" Nora answered cruelly. \"Then you can  stay at home and build up that precious health of yours.\"    \"Don't mention it,\" replied Hippy hastily. \"I would rather become an  emaciated wreck than deprive myself of your society.\"    \"It was simply glorious,\" said Anne to Grace as they stood waiting for  their carriage, \"and was there ever such a nice boy as David!\"    Grace pressed Anne's hand by way of answer. She knew that David had  understood the situation and had taken care to steer Anne clear of shoals,  and Grace determined that no matter what Miriam might say or do in future,  for David's sake it should be overlooked.          CHAPTER XI    A LION AT LAST      It was a week before the last borrowed decoration reposed in its original  place, and fully that long before the echoes of the sophomore ball died  out. It was pronounced the most successful class function given in Oakdale  for a number of years, and the sophomores felt justly proud of themselves.  Miriam Nesbit took particular pains to point out that the success of the  affair was in no way due to Grace Harlowe, and many of the girls who had  hitherto believed that Grace was a necessary factor in High School fun,  decided that they had perhaps overrated her ability.    Grace was fully cognizant of their change of heart, and spent more than  one unhappy hour over it, but outwardly she carried herself as though  unaware of the many little ill-natured stabs directed toward her. Anne,  who was completely ignored, took it philosophically, her only regret being  the fact that Grace had been dragged into difficulties on her account.    Thanksgiving had come and gone. The High School boys had played their  usual game of football with a neighboring school and whipped them to a  standstill, David had played on the team and covered himself with glory by  making a sensational touchdown. The girl chums had worn his colors and  shrieked themselves hoarse with joy over the prowess of their friend.    Miriam, secretly proud of her brother, resolved to make a like record for  herself during the next basketball game, which was to take place during  the following week. She believed that it was the last touch needed to make  her the avowed leader of her class. She even dreamed that the basketball  captaincy might one day be hers. To be sure Grace had Nora on her side,  and Nora was one of the regular players, but the other two players were  Miriam's faithful allies. That made three against two, and the second team  had practically declared in her favor. Grace would have to do differently  if she expected to keep the captaincy.    Meanwhile Grace was finding the captaincy of a team divided against itself  anything but satisfactory. The girls, with the exception of Nora, obeyed  her orders indifferently and as though under protest. It was almost  impossible to get every member to come to practice. Some one of them  invariably stayed away. On one occasion she spoke rather sharply to the  team about it, but her earnest words were received with sullen  resentment.    \"What is the use of working ourselves to death simply to have our game  handed over to the enemy?\" one girl had muttered.    Grace colored at this thrust, but closed her lips tightly and made no  reply. But the attitude of her team worked upon her mind, and she lost  confidence in herself. She realized that a new and injurious influence was  at work, and she was powerless to stem the tide of dissension that had  arisen.    The practice game was played on the afternoon before the contest, and not  even Jessica was there to witness it, although she had formerly been taken  as a matter of course. When invited to attend practice she had scornfully  refused it.    \"No, thank you,\" she said. \"If anything should go wrong to-morrow I'd be  accused of treachery. No one's reputation is safe in this class.\" At which  remark several sophomores had the grace to blush.    The day dawned bright and clear. Grace arrived at the gymnasium long  before the others. She was worried and anxious over the behavior of her  team. She was half afraid that some one of them would absent herself, in  which case one of the substitutes would have to be called, and Grace  doubted whether they could be relied upon.    Two months before, she had been certain that there were no players like  those of the sophomore organization. Now she had no confidence in them or  herself. She had a faint hope that when the game opened, her players would  forget their grievances and work for the honor of the sophomores. She  would do her best at all events, and Nora could be depended upon, too. All  this passed rapidly through Grace's mind as she waited for the team to  appear.    The spectators were arriving in numbers. The gallery was almost full, and  it still lacked fifteen minutes of the time before the game would be  called. The proverbial little bird had been extremely busy, and all sorts  of rumors regarding the two teams were afloat. The juniors were, as usual,  seated in a body and making a great deal of unnecessary noise. The members  of the sophomore class were scattered here and there. Anne and Jessica sat  with three or four of the girls who had refused to pay any attention to  the talk about Anne. A dozen or more of Miriam's flock sat together  watching for the appearance of their favorite. Occasionally they glanced  over toward Anne, whispered to each other, and then giggled in a way that  made Anne wince and Jessica feel like ordering them out of the gallery.    Grace and Nora stood talking together at one end of the gymnasium. Grace  kept an anxious eye on the clock. It was five minutes of two and Miriam  had not arrived. \"Would she dare to stay away?\" Grace wondered. At two  minutes of two there was a burst of applause from the section of the  gallery where Miriam's admirers were seated. Grace glanced quickly around  to see what had caused it, and beheld Miriam serenely approaching, a  satisfied smile on her face. She had waited until the last minute in the  hope of making a sensation, and had not been disappointed. Then the game  began.    Julia Crosby and Grace Harlowe once more faced each other on the field of  action. This time Grace won the toss and sent the ball whizzing to the  goal thrower, who tried for goal and caged the ball without effort. This  aroused the sophomores, and Grace could have danced for joy as she saw  that they were really going to work in earnest. The juniors were on the  alert, too. If they won to-day that meant the season's championship. If  they won the third game, that meant a complete whitewash for the  sophomores.    So the juniors hotly contested every inch of the ground, and the  sophomores found that they had their hands full. The first half of the  game closed with the score 8 to 6 in favor"]]]
