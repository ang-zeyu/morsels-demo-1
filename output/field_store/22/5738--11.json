Education makes the ignorant wise, the tyrant just,  promotes happiness, strengthens the mind, develops the will and makes  fruitless trees of humanity fruitful. Therefore in the human world some  have attained lofty degrees while others grope in the abyss of despair.  Nevertheless the highest attainment is possible for every member of the  human race even to the station of the prophets. This is the statement and  reasoning of the philosophers.    The prophets of God are the first educators. They bestow universal  education upon man and cause him to rise from lowest levels of savagery to  the highest pinnacles of spiritual development. The philosophers too are  educators along lines of intellectual training. At most they have only  been able to educate themselves and a limited number about them, to  improve their own morals and, so to speak, civilize themselves; but they  have been incapable of universal education. They have failed to cause an  advancement for any given nation from savagery to civilization.    It is evident that although education improves the morals of mankind,  confers the advantages of civilization and elevates man from lowest  degrees to the station of sublimity, there is nevertheless a difference in  the intrinsic or natal capacity of individuals. Ten children of the same  age, with equal station of birth, taught in the same school, partaking of  the same food, in all respects subject to the same environment, their  interests equal and in common, will evidence separate and distinct degrees  of capability and advancement; some exceedingly intelligent and  progressive, some of mediocre ability, others limited and incapable. One  may become a learned professor while another under the same course of  education proves dull and stupid. From all standpoints the opportunities  have been equal but the results and outcomes vary from the highest to  lowest degree of advancement. It is evident therefore that mankind differs  in natal capacity and intrinsic intellectual endowment. Nevertheless  although capacities are not the same, every member of the human race is  capable of education.    His Holiness Jesus Christ was an educator of humanity. His teachings were  altruistic; his bestowal universal. He taught mankind by the power of the  Holy Spirit and not through human agency, for the human power is limited  whereas the divine power is illimitable and infinite. The influence and  accomplishment of Christ will attest this. Galen, the Greek physician and  philosopher, who lived in the second century A.D., wrote a treatise upon  the civilization of nations. He was not a Christian but he has borne  testimony that religious beliefs exercise an extraordinary effect upon the  problems of civilization. In substance he says, \"There are certain people  among us, followers of Jesus the Nazarene who was killed in Jerusalem.  These people are truly imbued with moral principles which are the envy of  philosophers. They believe in God and fear Him. They have hopes in His  favors, therefore they shun all unworthy deeds and actions and incline to  praiseworthy ethics and morals. Day and night they strive that their deeds  may be commendable and that they may contribute to the welfare of  humanity; therefore each one of them is virtually a philosopher, for these  people have attained unto that which is the essence and purport of  philosophy. These people have praiseworthy morals even though they may be  illiterate.\"    The purpose of this is to show that the holy Manifestations of God, the  divine prophets, are the first teachers of the human race. They are  universal educators and the fundamental principles they have laid down are  the causes and factors of the advancement of nations.            THE HOLY SPIRIT      The elemental atoms which constitute all phenomenal existence and being in  this illimitable universe are in perpetual motion, undergoing continuous  degrees of progression. For instance, let us conceive of an atom in the  mineral kingdom progressing upward to the kingdom of the vegetable by  entering into the composition and fibre of a tree or plant. From thence it  is assimilated and transferred into the kingdom of the animal and finally  by the law and process of composition becomes a part of the body of man.  That is to say, it has traversed the intermediate degrees and stations of  phenomenal existence, entering into the composition of various organisms  in its journey. This motion or transference is progressive and perpetual,  for after disintegration of the human body into which it has entered, it  returns to the mineral kingdom whence it came, and will continue to  traverse the kingdoms of phenomena as before. This is an illustration  designed to show that the constituent elemental atoms of phenomena undergo  progressive transference and motion throughout the material kingdoms.    In its ceaseless progression and journeyings the atom becomes imbued with  the virtues and powers of each degree or kingdom it traverses. In the  degree of the mineral it possessed mineral affinities; in the kingdom of  the vegetable it manifested the virtue augmentative or power of growth; in  the animal organism it reflected the intelligence of that degree, and in  the kingdom of man it was qualified with human attributes or virtues.    Furthermore, the forms and organisms of phenomenal being and existence in  each of the kingdoms of the universe are myriad and numberless. The  vegetable plane or kingdom for instance has its infinite variety of types  and material structures of plant life, each distinct and different within  itself, no two exactly alike in composition and detail, for there are no  repetitions in nature, and the virtue augmentative cannot be confined to  any given image or shape. Each leaf has its own particular identity, so to  speak, its own individuality as a leaf. Therefore each atom of the  innumerable elemental atoms, during its ceaseless motion through the  kingdoms of existence as a constituent of organic composition, not only  becomes imbued with the powers and virtues of the kingdoms it traverses  but also reflects the attributes and qualities of the forms and organisms  of those kingdoms. As each of these forms has its individual and  particular virtue, therefore each elemental atom of the universe has the  opportunity of expressing an infinite variety of those individual virtues.  No atom is bereft or deprived of this opportunity or right of expression.  Nor can it be said of any given atom that it is denied equal opportunities  with other atoms; nay, all are privileged to possess the virtues existent  in these kingdoms and to reflect the attributes of their organisms. In the  various transformations or passages from kingdom to kingdom, the virtues  expressed by the atoms in each degree are peculiar to that degree. For  example, in the world of the mineral, the atom does not express the  vegetable form and organism, and when through the process of transmutation  it assumes the virtues of the vegetable degree, it does not reflect the  attributes of animal organisms, and so on.    It is evident then that each elemental atom of the universe is possessed  of a capacity to express all the virtues of the universe. This is a subtle  and abstract realization. Meditate upon it, for within it lies the true  explanation of pantheism. From this point of view and perception,  pantheism is a truth, for every atom in the universe possesses or reflects  all the virtues of life, the manifestation of which is effected through  change and transformation. Therefore the origin and outcome of phenomena  is verily the omnipresent God for the reality of all phenomenal existence  is through Him. There is neither reality nor the manifestation of reality  without the instrumentality of God. Existence is realized and possible  through the bounty of God, just as the ray or flame emanating from this  lamp is realized through the bounty of the lamp from which it originates.  Even so all phenomena are realized through the divine bounty, and the  explanation of true pantheistic statement and principle is that the  phenomena of the universe find realization through the one power animating  and dominating all things; and all things are but manifestations of its  energy and bounty. The virtue of being and existence is through no other  agency. Therefore in the words of Baha'u'llah the first teaching is the  oneness of the world of humanity....    Baha'u'llah has announced that no matter how far the world of humanity may  advance in material civilization, it is nevertheless in need of spiritual  virtues and the bounties of God. The spirit of man is not illumined and  quickened through material sources. It is not resuscitated by  investigating phenomena of the world of matter. The spirit of man is in  need of the protection of the Holy Spirit. Just as he advances by  progressive stages from the mere physical world of being into the  intellectual realm, so must he develop upward in moral attributes and  spiritual graces. In the process of this attainment he is ever in need of  the bestowals of the Holy Spirit. Material development may be likened to  the glass of a lamp whereas divine virtues and spiritual susceptibilities  are the light within the glass. The lamp chimney is worthless without the  light; likewise man in his material condition requires the radiance and  vivification of the divine graces and merciful attributes. Without the  presence of the Holy Spirit he is lifeless. Although physically and  mentally alive he is spiritually dead. His Holiness Christ announced,  \"That which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is  spirit,\" meaning that man must be born again. As the babe is born into the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19239"],[0,"Bahá'í World Faith (#13)"],[1,"changes but not  obliteration; and this is a rational proof that man is everlasting,  everliving. Therefore death is only a relative term implying change. For  example, we will say that this light before me, having reappeared in  another incandescent lamp, has died in the one and lives in the other.  This is not death in reality. The perfections of the mineral are  translated into the vegetable and from thence into the animal, the virtue  always attaining a plus or superlative degree in the upward change. In  each kingdom we find the same virtues manifesting themselves more fully,  proving that the reality has been transferred from a lower to a higher  form and kingdom of being. Therefore non-existence is only relative and  absolute non-existence inconceivable. This rose in my hand will become  disintegrated and its symmetry destroyed, but the elements of its  composition remain changeless; nothing affects their elemental integrity.  They cannot become non-existent; they are simply transferred from one  state to another.    Through his ignorance, man fears death; but the death he shrinks from is  imaginary and absolutely unreal; it is only human imagination.    The bestowal and grace of God have quickened the realm of existence with  life and being. For existence there is neither change nor transformation;  existence is ever existence; it can never be translated into  non-existence. It is gradation; a degree below a higher degree is  considered as non-existence. This dust beneath our feet, as compared with  our being is non-existent. When the human body crumbles into dust we can  say it has become non-existent; therefore its dust in relation to living  forms of human being is as non-existent but in its own sphere it is  existent, it has its mineral being. Therefore it is well proved that  absolute non-existence is impossible; it is only relative.    The purpose is this;--that the everlasting bestowal of God vouchsafed to  man is never subject to corruption. Inasmuch as He has endowed the  phenomenal world with being, it is impossible for that world to become  non-being, for it is the very genesis of God; it is the realm of  origination; it is a creational and not a subjective world, and the bounty  descending upon it is continuous and permanent. Therefore man the highest  creature of the phenomenal world is endowed with that continuous bounty  bestowed by divine generosity without cessation. For instance, the rays of  the sun are continuous, the heat of the sun emanates from it without  cessation; no discontinuance of it is conceivable. Even so the bestowal of  God is descending upon the world of humanity, never ceasing, continuous,  forever. If we say that the bestowal of existence ceases or falters it is  equivalent to saying that the sun can exist with cessation of its  effulgence. Is this possible? Therefore the effulgences of existence are  ever-present and continuous.    The conception of annihilation is a factor in human degradation, a cause  of human debasement and lowliness, a source of human fear and abjection.  It has been conducive to the dispersion and weakening of human thought  whereas the realization of existence and continuity has upraised man to  sublimity of ideals, established the foundations of human progress and  stimulated the development of heavenly virtues; therefore it behoves man  to abandon thoughts of non-existence and death which are absolutely  imaginary and see himself ever living, everlasting in the divine purpose  of his creation. He must turn away from ideas which degrade the human  soul, so that day by day and hour by hour he may advance upward and higher  to spiritual perception of the continuity of the human reality. If he  dwells upon the thought of non-existence he will become utterly  incompetent; with weakened will-power his ambition for progress will be  lessened and the acquisition of human virtues will cease.    Therefore you must thank God that He has bestowed upon you the blessing of  life and existence in the human kingdom. Strive diligently to acquire  virtues befitting your degree and station. Be as lights of the world which  cannot be hid and which have no setting in horizons of darkness. Ascend to  the zenith of an existence which is never beclouded by the fears and  forebodings of non-existence. When man is not endowed with inner  perception he is not informed of these important mysteries. The retina of  outer vision though sensitive and delicate may nevertheless be a hindrance  to the inner eye which alone can perceive. The bestowals of God which are  manifest in all phenomenal life are sometimes hidden by intervening veils  of mental and mortal vision which render man spiritually blind and  incapable but when those scales are removed and the veils rent asunder,  then the great signs of God will become visible and he will witness the  eternal light filling the world. The bestowals of God are all and always  manifest. The promises of heaven are ever present. The favors of God are  all-surrounding but should the conscious eye of the soul of man remain  veiled and darkened he will be led to deny these universal signs and  remain deprived of these manifestations of divine bounty. Therefore we  must endeavor with heart and soul in order that the veil covering the eye  of inner vision may be removed, that we may behold the manifestations of  the signs of God, discern His mysterious graces, and realize that material  blessings as compared with spiritual bounties are as nothing. The  spiritual blessings of God are greatest. When we were in the mineral  kingdom, although endowed with certain gifts and powers, they were not to  be compared with the blessings of the human kingdom. In the matrix of the  mother we were the recipients of endowments and blessings of God, yet  these were as nothing compared to the powers and graces bestowed upon us  after birth into this human world. Likewise if we are born from the matrix  of this physical and phenomenal environment into the freedom and loftiness  of the life and vision spiritual, we shall consider this mortal existence  and its blessings as worthless by comparison.    In the spiritual world, the divine bestowals are infinite, for in that  realm there is neither separation nor disintegration which characterize  the world of material existence. Spiritual existence is absolute  immortality, completeness and unchangeable being. Therefore we must thank  God that He has created for us both material blessings and spiritual  bestowals. He has given us material gifts and spiritual graces, outer  sight to view the lights of the sun and inner vision by which we may  perceive the glory of God. He has designed the outer ear to enjoy the  melodies of sound and the inner hearing wherewith we may hear the voice of  our creator. We must strive with energies of heart, soul and mind to  develop and manifest the perfections and virtues latent within the  realities of the phenomenal world, for the human reality may be compared  to a seed. If we sow the seed, a mighty tree appears from it. The virtues  of the seed are revealed in the tree; it puts forth branches, leaves,  blossoms, and produces fruits. All these virtues were hidden and potential  in the seed. Through the blessing and bounty of cultivation these virtues  became apparent. Similarly the merciful God our creator has deposited  within human realities certain virtues latent and potential. Through  education and culture, these virtues deposited by the loving God will  become apparent in the human reality even as the unfoldment of the tree  from within the germinating seed.          RACE UNITY, ASSURANCE OF WORLD PEACE      Today I am most happy, for I see here a gathering of the servants of God.  I see the white and colored people together. In the estimation of God  there is no distinction of color; all are one in the color and beauty of  servitude to him. Color is not important; the heart is all-important. It  matters not what the exterior may be if the heart be pure and white  within. God does not behold differences of hue and complexion; He looks at  the hearts. He whose morals and virtues are praiseworthy is preferred in  the presence of God; he who is devoted to the Kingdom is most beloved. In  the realm of genesis and creation the question of color is of least  importance.    The mineral kingdom abounds with many-colored substances and compositions  but we find no strife among them on that account. In the kingdom of the  plant and vegetable, distinct and variegated hues exist but the fruit and  flowers are not in conflict for that reason. Nay, rather, the very fact  that there is difference and variety lends a charm to the garden. If all  were of the same color the effect would be monotonous and depressing. When  you enter a rose-garden the wealth of color and variety of floral forms  spread before you a picture of wonder and beauty. The world of humanity is  like a garden and the various races are the flowers which constitute its  adornment and decoration. In the animal kingdom also we find variety of  color. See how the doves differ in beauty yet they live together in  perfect peace, and love each other. They do not make difference of color a  cause of discord and strife. They view each other as the same species and  kind. They know they are one in kind. Often a white dove soars aloft with  a black one. Throughout the animal kingdom we do not find the creatures  separated because of color. They recognize unity of species and oneness of  kind. If we do not find color distinction drawn in a kingdom of lower  intelligence and reason, how can it be justified among human beings,  especially when we know that all have come from the same source and belong  to the same household? In origin and intention of creation mankind is one.  Distinctions of race and color have arisen afterward.    Therefore today I am exceedingly glad that both white and colored people  have gathered here "]]]
