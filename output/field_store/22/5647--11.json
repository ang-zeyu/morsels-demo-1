As long ago as 1877, I  showed that Tii was an Egyptian of middle rank, probably of Heliopolitan  origin.    Connexions of this kind had been frequently formed by his ancestors,  but the Egyptian women of inferior rank whom they had brought into their  harems had always remained in the background, and if the sons of these  concubines were ever fortunate enough to come to the throne, it was in  default of heirs of pure blood. Amenothes III. married Tii, gave her  for her dowry the town of Zalu in Lower Egypt, and raised her to the  position of queen, in spite of her low extraction. She busied herself  in the affairs of State, took precedence of the princesses of the solar  family, and appeared at her husband's side in public ceremonies, and was  so figured on the monuments. If, as there is reason to believe, she was  born near Heliopolis, it is easy to understand how her influence may  have led Amenothes to pay special honour to a Heliopolitan divinity.  He had built, at an early period of his reign, a sanctuary to Atonu at  Memphis, and in the Xth year he constructed for him a chapel at Thebes  itself,* to the south of the last pylon of ihutmosis III., and endowed  this deity with property at the expense of Anion.         * This temple seems to have been raised on the site of the       building which is usually attributed to Amenothes II. and       Amenothes III. The blocks bearing the name of Amenothes II.       had been used previously, like most of those which bear the       cartouches of Amenothes III. The temple of Atonu, which was       demolished by Harmhabi or one of the Ramses, was       subsequently rebuilt with the remains of earlier edifices,       and dedicated to Amon.    [Illustration: 079.jpg MARRIAGE SCARABAEUS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph of the scarabaeus       preserved at Gizeh.    He had several sons;* but the one who succeeded him, and who, like  him, was named Amenothes, was the most paradoxical of all the Egyptian  sovereigns of ancient times.**         * One of them, Thutmosis, was high priest of Phtah, and we       possess several monuments erected by him in the temple of       Memphis; another, Tutonkhamon, subsequently became king. He       also had several daughters by Tii--Sitamon.         ** The absence of any cartouches of Amenothes IV. or his       successors in the table of Abydos prevented Champollion and       Rosellini from classifying these sovereigns with any       precision. Nestor L'hote tried to recognise in the first of       them, whom he called _Bakhen-Balchnan_, a king belonging to       the very ancient dynasties, perhaps the Hyksos Apakhnan, but       Lepsius and Hincks showed that he must be placed between       Amenothes III. and Harmhabi, that he was first called       Amenothes like his father, but that he afterwards took the       name of Baknaten, which is now read Khunaten or Khuniaton.       His singular aspect made it difficult to decide at first       whether a man or a woman was represented. Mariette, while       pronouncing him to be a man, thought that he had perhaps       been taken prisoner in the Sudan and mutilated, which would       have explained his effeminate appearance, almost like that       of an eunuch. Recent attempts have been made to prove that       Amenothes IV. and Khuniaton were two distinct persons, or       that Khuniaton was a queen; but they have hitherto been       rejected by Egyptologists.    He made up for the inferiority of his birth on account of the plebeian  origin of his mother Tii,* by his marriage with Nofrititi, a princess  of the pure solar race.** Tii, long accustomed to the management of  affairs, exerted her influence over him even more than she had done over  her husband. Without officially assuming the rank, she certainly for  several years possessed the power, of regent, and gave a definite  Oriental impress to her son's religious policy. No outward changes were  made at first; Amenothes, although showing his preference for Heliopolis  by inscribing in his protocol the title of prophet of Harmakhis,  which he may, however, have borne before his accession, maintained his  residence at Thebes, as his father had done before him, continued to  sacrifice to the Theban divinities, and to follow the ancient paths and  the conventional practices.***         * The filiation of Amenothes IV. and Tii has given rise to       more than one controversy. The Egyptian texts do not define       it explicitly, and the title borne by Tii has been       considered by some to prove that Amenothes IV. was her son,       and by others that she was the mother of Queen Nofrititi.       The Tel el-Amarna correspondence solves the question,       however, as it gives a letter from Dushratta to Khuniaton,       in which Tii is called \"thy mother.\"         ** Nofrititi, the wife of Amenothes IV., like all the       princesses of that time, has been supposed to be of Syrian       origin, and to have changed her name on her arrival in       Egypt. The place which she holds beside her husband is the       same as that which belongs to legitimate queens, like       Nofritari, Ahmosis, and Hatshopsitu, and the example of       these princesses is enough to show us what was her real       position; she was most probably a daughter of one of the       princesses of the solar blood, perhaps of one of the sisters       of Amenothes III., and Amenothes IV. married her so as to       obtain through her the rights which were wanting to him       through his mother Tii.         *** The tomb of Ramses, governor of Thebes and priest of       Mait, shows us in one part of it the king, still faithful to       his name of Amenothes, paying homage to the god Amon, lord       of Karnak, while everywhere else the worship of Atonu       predominates. The cartouches on the tomb of Pari, read by       Bouriant Akhopiruri, and by Scheil more correctly       Nofirkhopiruri, seem to me to represent a transitional form       of the protocol of Amenothes IV., and not the name of a new       Pharaoh; the inscription in which they are to be found bears       the date of his third year.    He either built a temple to the Theban god, or enlarged the one which  his father had constructed at Karnak, and even opened new quarries at  Syene and Silsileh for providing granite and sandstone for the adornment  of this monument. His devotion to the invincible Disk, however, soon  began to assert itself, and rendered more and more irksome to him the  religious observances which he had constrained himself to follow. There  was nothing and no one to hinder him from giving free course to his  inclinations, and the nobles and priests were too well trained in  obedience to venture to censure anything he might do, even were it to  result in putting the whole population into motion, from Elephantine to  the sea-coast, to prepare for the intruded deity a dwelling which should  eclipse in magnificence the splendour of the great temple. A few  of those around him had become converted of their own accord to his  favourite worship, but these formed a very small minority. Thebes had  belonged to Amon so long that the king could never hope to bring it  to regard Atonu as anything but a being of inferior rank. Each  city belonged to some god, to whom was attributed its origin, its  development, and its prosperity, and whom it could not forsake without  renouncing its very existence. If Thebes became separated from Amon it  would be Thebes no longer, and of this Amenothes was so well aware that  he never attempted to induce it to renounce its patron. His residence  among surroundings which he detested at length became so intolerable,  that he resolved to leave the place and create a new capital elsewhere.  The choice of a new abode would have presented no difficulty to him had  he been able to make up his mind to relegate Atonu to the second rank of  divinities; Memphis, Heracleopolis, Siut, Khmunu, and, in fact, all the  towns of the valley would have deemed themselves fortunate in securing  the inheritance of their rival, but not one of them would be false to  its convictions or accept the degradation of its own divine founder,  whether Phtah, Harshafitu, Anubis, or Thot. A newly promoted god  demanded a new city; Amenothes, therefore, made selection of a broad  plain extending on the right bank of the Nile, in the eastern part of  the Hermopolitan nome, to which he removed with all his court about the  fourth or fifth year of his reign.*         * The last date with the name of Amenothes is that of the       year V., on a papyrus from the Payilm; elsewhere we find       from the year VI. the name of Khuniaton, by the side of       monuments with the cartouche of Amenothes; we may conclude       from this that the foundation of the town dates from the       year IV. or V. at the latest, when the prince, having       renounced the worship of Amon, left Thebes that he might be       able to celebrate freely that of Atonu.    He found here several obscure villages without any historical or  religious traditions, and but thinly populated; Amenothes chose one  of them, the Et-Tel of the present day, and built there a palace  for himself and a temple for his god. The temple, like that of Ea at  Heliopolis, was named _Hait-Banbonu_, the Mansion of the Obelisk. It  covered an immense area, of which the sanctuary, however, occupied an  inconsiderable part; it was flanked by brick storehouses, and the whole  was surrounded by a thick wall. The remains show that the temple was  built of white limestone, of fine quality, but that it was almost  devoid of ornament, for there was no time to cover it with the usual  decorations.*         * The opinion of Brugsch, that the arrangement of the       various parts differed from that of other temples, and was       the effect of foreign influence, has not been borne out "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17326"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 6 (of 12) (#13)"],[1,"belonging to it formed an isolated border province in the  midst of the independent baronies.*         * The extent of the principality of Thebes under the high       priests has been determined by means of the sacerdotal       titles of the Theban princesses.    The representative of the dynasty reigning at Tanis held the remainder  of Egypt from Shit to the Mediterranean--the half belonging to the  Memphite Phtah and the Helio-politan Ra, as opposed to that assigned to  Anion. The origin of this Tanite sovereign is uncertain, but it would  appear that he was of more exalted rank than his rival in the south. The  official chronicling of events was marked by the years of his reign, and  the chief acts of the government were carried out in his name even in  the Thebaid.* Repeated inundations had caused the ruin of part of the  temple of Karnak, and it was by the order and under the auspices of this  prince that all the resources of the country were employed to accomplish  the much-needed restoration.**         * I have pointed out that the years of the reign mentioned       in the inscriptions of the high priests and the kings of the       sacerdotal line must be attributed to their suzerains, the       kings of Tanis. Hrihor alone seems to have been an       exception, since to him are attributed the dates inscribed       in the name of the King Siamon: M. Daressy, however, will       not admit this, and asserts that this Siamon was a Tanite       sovereign who must not be identified with Hrihor, and must       be placed at least two or three generations later than the       last of the Ramessides.         * The real name Nsbindidi and the first monument of the       Manethonian Smendes were discovered in the quarries of       Dababieh, opposite Gebelen.      It would have been impossible for him to have exercised any authority  over so rich and powerful a personage as Hrihor had he not possessed  rights to the crown, before which even the high priests of Amon were  obliged to bow, and hence it has been supposed that he was a descendant  of Ramses II. The descendants of this sovereign were doubtless divided  into at least two branches, one of which had just become extinct,  leaving no nearer heir than Hrihor, while another, of which there were  many ramifications, had settled in the Delta. The majority of these  descendants had become mingled with the general population, and had sunk  to the condition of private individuals; they had, however, carefully  preserved the tradition of their origin, and added proudly to their name  the qualification of royal son of Ramses. They were degenerate scions  of the Ramessides, and had neither the features nor the energy of their  ancestor. One of them, Zodphta-haufonkhi, whose mummy was found at Deir  el-Bahari, appears to have been tall and vigorous, but the head lacks  the haughty refinement which characterizes those of Seti I. and Ramses  II., and the features are heavy and coarse, having a vulgar, commonplace  expression.    [Illustration: 093.jpg ZODPHTAHAUFONKHI, ROYAL SON OF RAMSES]         Drawn by Boudier, from the photograph by Insinger.    It seems probable that one branch of the family, endowed with greater  capability than the rest, was settled at Tanis, where Sesostris had,  as we have seen, resided for many years; Smendes was the first of this  branch to ascend the throne. The remembrance of his remote ancestor,  Ramses IL, which was still treasured up in the city he had completely  rebuilt, as well as in the Delta into which he had infused new life, was  doubtless of no small service in securing the crown for his descendant,  when, the line of the Theban kings having come to an end, the Tanites  put in their claim to the succession. We are unable to discover if  war broke out between the two competitors, or if they arrived at an  agreement without a struggle; but, at all events, we may assume that,  having divided Egypt between them, neither of them felt himself strong  enough to overcome his rival, and contented himself with the possession  of half the empire, since he could not possess it in its entirety. We  may fairly believe that Smendes had the greater right to the throne,  and, above all, the more efficient army of the two, since, had it been  otherwise, Hrihor would never have consented to yield him the priority.    The unity of Egypt was, to outward appearances, preserved, through the  nominal possession by Smendes of the suzerainty; but, as a matter of  fact, it had ceased to exist, and the fiction of the two kingdoms  had become a reality for the first time within the range of history.  Henceforward there were two Egypts, governed by different constitutions  and from widely remote centres. Theban Egypt was, before all things,  a community recognizing a theocratic government, in which the kingly  office was merged in that of the high priest. Separated from Asia by the  length of the Delta, it turned its attention, like the Pharaohs of the  VIth and XIIth dynasties, to Ethiopia, and owing to its distance from  the Mediterranean, and from the new civilization developed on its  shores, it became more and more isolated, till at length it was reduced  to a purely African state. Northern Egypt, on the contrary, maintained  contact with European and Asiatic nations; it took an interest in their  future, it borrowed from them to a certain extent whatever struck it as  being useful or beautiful, and when the occasion presented itself, it  acted in concert with Mediterranean powers. There was an almost constant  struggle between these two divisions of the empire, at times  breaking out into an open rupture, to end as often in a temporary  re-establishment of unity. At one time Ethiopia would succeed in  annexing Egypt, and again Egypt would seize some part of Ethiopia; but  the settlement of affairs was never final, and the conflicting elements,  brought with difficulty into harmony, relapsed into their usual  condition at the end of a few years. A kingdom thus divided against  itself could never succeed in maintaining its authority over those  provinces which, even in the heyday of its power, had proved impatient  of its yoke.    Asia was associated henceforward in the minds of the Egyptians with  painful memories of thwarted ambitions, rather than as offering a field  for present conquest. They were pursued by the memories of their former  triumphs, and the very monuments of their cities recalled what they  were anxious to forget. Wherever they looked within their towns they  encountered the representation of some Asiatic scene; they read the  names of the cities of Syria on the walls of their temples; they saw  depicted on them its princes and its armies, whose defeat was recorded  by the inscriptions as well as the tribute which they had been forced  to pay. The sense of their own weakness prevented the Egyptians from  passing from useless regrets to action; when, however, one or other of  the Pharaohs felt sufficiently secure on the throne to carry his troops  far afield, he was always attracted to Syria, and crossed her frontiers,  often, alas! merely to encounter defeat.
