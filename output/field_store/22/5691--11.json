Indeed, since the contradictory of a privative carries  with it the privative limitation, a stone is strictly 'not-blind': that  is, it is 'not-something-that-normally-having-sight-wants-it.'    Contrary Terms are those that (within a certain genus or _suppositio_)  severally connote differential qualities that are, in fact, mutually  incompatible in the same relation to the same thing, and therefore  cannot be predicated of the same subject in the same relation; and, so  far, they resemble Contradictory Terms: but they differ from  contradictory terms in this, that the differential quality connoted by  each of them is definitely positive; no Contrary Term is infinite, but  is limited to part of the _suppositio_ excluded by the others; so that,  possibly, neither of two Contraries is truly predicable of a given  subject. Thus 'blue' and 'red' are Contraries, for they cannot both be  predicated of the same thing in the same relation; but are not  Contradictories, since, in a given case, neither may be predicable: if a  flower is blue in a certain part, it cannot in the same part be red; but  it may be neither blue nor red, but yellow; though it is certainly  either blue or not-blue. All co-ordinate terms are formal Contraries;  but if, in fact, a series of co-ordinates comprises only two (as  male-female), they are empirical Contradictories; since each includes  all that area of the _suppositio_ which the other excludes.    The extremes of a series of co-ordinate terms are Opposites; as, in a  list of colours, white and black, the most strongly contrasted, are said  to be opposites, or as among moods of feeling, rapture and misery are  opposites. But this distinction is of slight logical importance.  Imperfect Positive and Negative couples, like 'happy and unhappy,' which  (as we have seen) are not contradictories, are often called Opposites.    The members of any series of Contraries are all included by any one of  them and its contradictory, as all colours come under 'red' and  'not-red,' all moods of feeling under 'happy' and 'not-happy.'          CHAPTER V    THE CLASSIFICATION OF PROPOSITIONS      Sec. 1. Logicians classify Propositions according to Quantity, Quality,  Relation and Modality.    As to Quantity, propositions are either Universal or Particular; that is  to say, the predicate is affirmed or denied either of the whole subject  or of a part of it--of _All_ or of _Some S_.        _All S is P_ (that is, _P_ is predicated of _all S_).      _Some S is P_ (that is, _P_ is predicated of _some S_).    An Universal Proposition may have for its subject a singular term, a  collective, a general term distributed, or an abstract term.    (1) A proposition having a singular term for its subject, as _The Queen  has gone to France_, is called a Singular Proposition; and some  Logicians regard this as a third species of proposition with respect to  quantity, distinct from the Universal and Particular; but that is  needless.    (2) A collective term may be the subject, as _The Black Watch is ordered  to India_. In this case, as well as in singular propositions, a  predication is made concerning the whole subject as a whole.    (3) The subject may be a general term taken in its full denotation, as  _All apes are sagacious_; and in this case a Predication is made  concerning the whole subject distributively; that is, of each and  everything the subject stands for.    (4) Propositions whose subjects are abstract terms, though they may  seem to be formally Singular, are really as to their meaning  distributive Universals; since whatever is true of a quality is true of  whatever thing has that quality so far as that quality is concerned.  _Truth will prevail_ means that _All true propositions are accepted at  last_ (by sheer force of being true, in spite of interests, prejudices,  ignorance and indifference). To bear this in mind may make one cautious  in the use of abstract terms.    In the above paragraphs a distinction is implied between Singular and  Distributive Universals; but, technically, every term, whether subject  or predicate, when taken in its full denotation (or universally), is  said to be 'distributed,' although this word, in its ordinary sense,  would be directly applicable only to general terms. In the above  examples, then, 'Queen,' 'Black Watch,' 'apes,' and 'truth' are all  distributed terms. Indeed, a simple definition of the Universal  Proposition is 'one whose subject is distributed.'    A Particular Proposition is one that has a general term for its subject,  whilst its predicate is not affirmed or denied of everything the subject  denotes; in other words, it is one whose subject is not distributed: as  _Some lions inhabit Africa_.    In ordinary discourse it is not always explicitly stated whether  predication is universal or particular; it would be very natural to say  _Lions inhabit Africa_, leaving it, as far as the words go, uncertain  whether we mean _all_ or _some_ lions. Propositions whose quantity is  thus left indefinite are technically called 'preindesignate,' their  quantity not being stated or designated by any introductory expression;  whilst propositions whose quantity is expressed, as _All  foundling-hospitals have a high death-rate_, or _Some wine is made from  grapes_, are said to be 'predesignate.' Now, the rule is that  preindesignate propositions are, for logical purposes, to be treated as  particular; since it is an obvious precaution of the science of proof,  in any practical application, _not to go beyond the evidence_. Still,  the rule may be relaxed if the universal quantity of a preindesignate  proposition is well known or admitted, as in _Planets shine with  reflected light_--understood of the planets of our solar system at the  present time. Again, such a proposition as _Man is the paragon of  animals_ is not a preindesignate, but an abstract proposition; the  subject being elliptical for _Man according to his proper nature_; and  the translation of it into a predesignate proposition is not _All men  are paragons_; nor can _Some men_ be sufficient, since an abstract can  only be adequately rendered by a distributed term; but we must say, _All  men who approach the ideal_. Universal real propositions, true without  qualification, are very scarce; and we often substitute for them  _general_ propositions, saying perhaps--_generally, though not  universally, S is P_. Such general propositions are, in strictness,  particular; and the logical rules concerning universals cannot be  applied to them without careful scrutiny of the facts.    The marks or predesignations of Quantity commonly used in Logic are: for  Universals, _All_, _Any_, _Every_, _Whatever_ (in the negative _No_ or  _No one_, see next Sec.); for Particulars, _Some_.    Now _Some_, technically used, does not mean _Some only,_ but _Some at  least_ (it may be one, or more, or all). If it meant '_Some only_,'  every particular proposition would be an exclusive exponible (chap. ii.  Sec. 3); since _Only some men are wise_ implies that _Some men are not  wise_. Besides, it may often happen in an investigation that all the  instances we have observed come under a certain rule, though we do not  yet feel justified in regarding the rule as universal; and this  situation is exactly met by the expression _Some_ (_it may be all_).    The words _Many_, _Most_, _Few_ are generally interpreted to mean  _Some_; but as _Most_ signifies that exceptions are known, and _Few_  that the exceptions are the more numerous, propositions thus  predesignate are in fact exponibles, mounting to _Some are_ and _Some  are not_. If to work with both forms be too cumbrous, so that we must  choose one, apparently _Few are_ should be treated as _Some are not_.  The scientific course to adopt with propositions predesignate by _Most_  or _Few_, is to collect statistics and determine the percentage; thus,  _Few men are wise_--say 2 per cent.    The Quantity of a proposition, then, is usually determined entirely by  the quantity of the subject, whether _all_ or _some_. Still, the  quantity of the predicate is often an important consideration; and  though in ordinary usage the predicate is seldom predesignate, Logicians  agree that in every Negative Proposition (see Sec. 2) the predicate is  'distributed,' that is to say, is denied altogether of the subject, and  that this is involved in the form of denial. To say _Some men are not  brave_, is to declare that the quality for which men may be called brave  is not found in any of the _Some men_ referred to: and to say _No men  are proof against flattery_, cuts off the being 'proof against flattery'  entirely from the list of human attributes. On the other hand, every  Affirmative Proposition is regarded as having an undistributed  predicate; that is to say, its predicate is not affirmed exclusively of  the subject. _Some men are wise_ does not mean that 'wise' cannot be  predicated of any other beings; it is equivalent to _Some men are wise_  (_whoever else may be_). And _All elephants are sagacious_ does not  limit sagacity to elephants: regarding 'sagacious' as possibly denoting  many animals of many species that exhibit the quality, this proposition  is equivalent to '_All elephants are_ some _sagacious animals_.' The  affirmative predication of a quality does not imply exclusive possession  of it as denial implies its complete absence; and, therefore, to regard  the predicate of an affirmative proposition as distributed would be to  go beyond the evidence and to take for granted what had never been  alleged.    Some Logicians, seeing that the quantity of predicates, though not  distinctly expressed, is recognised, and holding that it is the part of  Logic \"to make explicit in language whatever is implicit in thought,\"  have proposed to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18444"],[0,"The Story of the Hymns and Tunes (#13)"],[1,"anuel's Land.    This hymn is biographical, but not autobiographical. Like the discourses  in Herodotus and Plutarch, it is the voice of the dead speaking through  the sympathetic genius of the living after long generations. The strong,  stern Calvinist of 1636 in Aberdeen was not a poet, but he bequeathed  his spirit and life to the verse of a poet of 1845 in Melrose. Anne Ross  Cousin read his two hundred and twenty letters written during a two  years' captivity for his fidelity to the purer faith, and studied his  whole history and experience till her soul took his soul's place and  felt what he felt. Her poem of nineteen stanzas (152 lines) is the voice  of Rutherford the Covenanter, with the prolixity of his manner and age  sweetened by his triumphant piety, and that is why it belongs with the  _Hymns of Great Witnesses_. The three or four stanzas still occasionally  printed and sung are only recalled to memory by the above three lines.    Samuel Rutherford was born in Nisbet Parish, Scotland, in 1600. His  settled ministry was at Anworth, in Galloway--1630-1651--with a break  between 1636 and 1638, when Charles I. angered by his anti-prelatical  writings, silenced and banished him. Shut up in Aberdeen, but allowed,  like Paul in Rome, to live \"in his own hired house\" and write letters,  he poured out his heart's love in Epistles to his Anworth flock and to  the Non-conformists of Scotland. When his countrymen rose against the  attempted imposition of a new holy Romish service-book on their  churches, he escaped to his people, and soon after appeared in Edinburgh  and signed the covenant with the assembled ministers. Thirteen years  later, after Cromwell's death and the accession of Charles II. the wrath  of the prelates fell on him at St. Andrews, where the Presbytery had  made him rector of the college. The King's decree indicted him for  treason, stripped him of all his offices, and would have forced him to  the block had he not been stricken with his last sickness. When the  officers came to take him he said, \"I am summoned before a higher Judge  and Judicatory, and I am behooved to attend them.\" He died soon after,  in the year 1661.    The first, and a few other of the choicest stanzas of the hymn inspired  by his life and death are here given:        The sands of time are sinking,        The dawn of heaven breaks,      The summer morn I've sighed for--        The fair, sweet morn--awakes.      Dark, dark hath been the midnight,        But dayspring is at hand;      And glory, glory dwelleth        In Immanuel's land.           *       *       *       *       *        Oh! well it is for ever--        Oh! well for evermore:      My nest hung in no forest        Of all this death-doomed shore;      Yea, let this vain world vanish,        As from the ship the strand,      While glory, glory dwelleth        In Immanuel's land.           *       *       *       *       *        The little birds of Anworth--        I used to count them blest;      Now beside happier altars        I go to build my nest;      O'er these there broods no silence        No graves around them stand;      For glory deathless dwelleth        In Immanuel's land.        I have borne scorn and hatred,        I have borne wrong and shame,      Earth's proud ones have reproached me        For Christ's thrice blessed name.      Where God's seals set the fairest,        They've stamped their foulest brand;      But judgment shines like noonday        In Immanuel's land.        They've summoned me before them,        But there I may not come;      My Lord says, \"Come up hither;\"        My Lord says, \"Welcome home;\"      My King at His white throne        My presence doth command,      Where glory, glory dwelleth,        In Immanuel's land.    A reminiscence of St. Paul in his second Epistle to Timothy (chap. 4)  comes with the last two stanzas.      _THE TUNE._    The tender and appropriate choral in B flat, named \"Rutherford\" was  composed by D'Urhan, a French musician, probably a hundred years ago. It  was doubtless named by those who long afterwards fitted it to the words,  and knew whose spiritual proxy the lady stood who indited the hymn. It  is reprinted in Peloubet's _Select Songs_, and in the _Coronation  Hymnal_. Naturally in the days of the hymn's more frequent use people  became accustomed to calling \"The sands of time are sinking,\"  \"Rutherford's Hymn.\" Rutherford's own words certainly furnished the  memorable refrain with its immortal glow and gladness. One of his joyful  exclamations as he lay dying of his lingering disease was, \"Glory  shineth in Immanuel's Land!\"    Chretien (Christian) Urhan, or D'Urhan, was born at Montjoie, France,  about 1788, and died, in Paris, 1845. He was a noted violin-player, and  composer, also, of vocal and instrumental music.    Mrs. Anne Ross (Cundell) Cousin, daughter of David Ross Cundell, M.D.,  and widow of Rev. William Cousin of the Free church of Scotland, was  born in Melrose (?), 1824. She wrote many poems, most of which are  beautiful meditations rather than lyrics suitable for public song. Her  \"Rutherford Hymn\" was first published in the _Christian Treasury_, 1857.      GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS.    \"_Verzage Nicht Du Hauflein Klein._\"    The historian tells us that before the battle of Lutzen, during the  Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), King Gustavus of Sweden, in the thick fog  of an autumn morning, with the Bohemian and Austrian armies of Emperor  Ferdinand in front of him, knelt before his troops, and his whole army  knelt with him in prayer. Then ten thousand voices and the whole concert  of regimental bands burst forth in this brave song:        Fear not, O little flock, the foe      Who madly seeks your overthrow,        Dread not his rage and power:      What though your courage sometimes faints,      His seeming triumph o'er God's saints        Lasts but a little hour.        Be of good cheer, your cause belongs      To Him who can avenge your wrongs;        Leave it to Him, our Lord:      Though hidden yet from all our eyes,      He sees the Gideon who shall rise        To save us and His word.        As true as God's own word is true,      Nor earth nor hell with all their crew,        Against us shall prevail:      A jest and by-word they are grown;      God is with us, we are His own,        Our victory cannot fail.        Amen, Lord Jesus, grant our prayer!      Great Captain, now Thine arm make bare,        Fight for us once again:      So shall Thy saints and martyrs raise      A mighty chorus to Thy praise,        World without end. Amen.    The army of Gustavus moved forward to victory as the fog lifted; but at  the moment of triumph a riderless horse came galloping back to the camp.  It was the horse of the martyred King.    The battle song just quoted--next to Luther's \"Ein feste Burg\" the most  famous German hymn--has always since that day been called \"Gustavus  Adolphus' Hymn\"; and the mingled sorrow and joy of the event at Lutzen  named it also \"King Gustavus' Swan Song.\" Gustavus Adolphus did not  write hymns. He could sing them, and he could make them historic--and it  was this connection that identified him with the famous battle song. Its  author was the Rev. Johan Michael Altenburg, a Lutheran clergyman, who  composed apparently both hymn and tune on receiving news of the king's  victory at Leipsic a year before.    Gustavus Adolphus was born in 1594. His death on the battlefield  occurred Nov. 5, 1632--when he was in the prime of his manhood. He was  one of the greatest military commanders in history, besides being a  great ruler and administrator, and a devout Christian. He was, during  the Thirty Years' War (until his untimely death), the leading champion  of Protestantism in Europe.    The English translator of the battle song was Miss Catherine Winkworth,  born in London, Sept. 13, 1827. She was an industrious and successful  translator of German hymns, contributing many results of her work to two  English editions of the _Lyra Germania_, to the _Church Book of  England_, and to _Christian Singers of Germany_. She died in 1878.    The tune of \"Ravendale\" by Walter Stokes (born 1847) is the best modern  rendering of the celebrated hymn.      PAUL GERHARDT.    \"_Befiehl Du Deine Wege._\"    Paul Gerhardt was one of those minstrels of experience who are--       \"Cradled into poetry by wrong,      And learn in suffering what they teach in song.\"    He was a graduate of that school when he wrote his \"Hymn of Trust:\"        Commit thou all thy griefs        And ways into His hands;      To His sure trust and tender care        Who earth and heaven commands.        Thou on the Lord rely,        So, safe, shalt thou go on;      Fix on His work thy steadfast eye,        So shall thy work be done.           *       *       *       *       *        Give to the winds thy fears;        Hope, and be undismayed;      God hears thy sighs and counts thy tears,        He shall lift up thy head.        Through waves and clouds and storms        He gently clears thy way;      Wait thou His time, so shall this night        Soon end in joyous day.    Gerhardt was born at Grafenheinchen, Saxony, 1606. Through the first and  best years of manhood's strength (during the Thirty Years' War), a  wandering preacher tossed from place to place, he was without a parish  and without a home.    After the peace of Westphalia he settled in the little village of  Mittenwalde. He was then forty-four years old. Four years later he  married and removed to a Berlin church. During his residence there he  buried his wife, and four of his children, was deposed from the  ministry because his Lutheran doctrines offended the Elector Frederick,  and finally retired as a simple arch-deacon to a small parish in Lubben,  where he preached, toiled, and suffered amid a rough and uncongenial  people till he died, Jan. 16, 1676.
