[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18647"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Egypt (#13)"],[1,"\"wadis,\" as the mountain valleys are called,  wild plants grow in such profusion as to give them the appearance of  rock gardens.    In aspect the desert varies very much, according to the time of day or  changing effect of light.    At dawn a curious mauve tint suffuses it, and the sun rises sharp and  clear above the horizon, which also stands out crisply against the  sky, so pure is the air. Presently, as the sun slowly rises higher in  the sky, every shrub or stone or little inequality of surface is  tipped with gold and throws long blue shadows across the sand. At  midday a fierce glare envelops it, obliterating detail and colour,  while by moonlight it is a fairyland of silver, solemn, still, and  mysterious. Each phase has its special beauty, which interests the  traveller and robs his journey of monotony.    Scattered over the surface of the sand are innumerable pebbles of all  sizes and colours--onyx, cornelian, agate, and many more, as well as  sea fossils and other petrifactions which boys would love to collect.  And it is also curious to notice that the rocks which crop up in all  directions become _sunburnt_, and limestone, naturally of a dazzling  white, often assumes a variety of tints under the influence of the  powerful sun, as may be seen in the foreground of my picture of the  pyramids.    Animal life also exists in profusion; every tuft of scrub supports a  variety of insects upon which the hunting spider and desert lizard  feed; the tracks of giant beetles or timid jerboa scour the sand in  all directions, and many wild-birds make these wastes their home.  Prowling wolves and foxes hunt the tiny gazelle, while the rocky  hills, in which the wild goats make their home, also give shelter to  the hyenas and jackals, which haunt the caravan routes to feast upon  the dying animals which fall abandoned to their fate.    The life of the desert is not confined to the beasts, however, for  many Bedawin tribes roam about them in search of water or fodder  for their animals, and of all the Eastern races I have met none are  more interesting than these desert nomads.    [Illustration: DESERT ARABS.]    The wandering life of the Bedawin makes it difficult for anyone to  become acquainted with them, while their reputation for lawlessness is  such that travellers on desert routes usually endeavour to avoid them.  In several parts of the desert near Egypt, however, important families  of them have settled so as to be near the farm-lands granted to them  by Ismail Pasha many years ago (nominally in return for military  services, but in reality to keep them quiet), and I have often visited  their camps at Beni Ayoub and Tel Bedawi, to find them courteous,  hospitable, and in the best sense of the word, gentlemen.    These camps are large, and the long lines of tents, pitched with  military precision, shelter probably more than 1,000 people, for  though the head sheykh may build a lodge of stone in which to  entertain his guests, the Arab is a gipsy who loves his tent.    The tents, which are often very large, are formed of heavy cloths of  goats'-hair woven in stripes of different colours, and supported by a  large number of poles; long tassels hang from the seams, and other  cloths are often attached to them so as to divide the tent into  different apartments. Clean sand forms the floor, on which at  nightfall a rug or carpet is spread to form a bed. Round the walls  are the gay saddle-bags and trappings of the camels and horses, as  well as many boxes ornamented with tinsel and painting, which contain  the wardrobes and other possessions of the inmates. At the tent-door,  stuck upright in the ground, is the long spear of its occupant, and  the large earthen pot which serves as fireplace, while in some shady  corner a row of zirs contain their supply of drinking water.  Turkeys and fowl give a homely look to the premises, where perhaps a  gentle-eyed gazelle is playmate to the rough-haired dogs few  Bedawin are without. Round about the tents children are playing,  while their mothers are working at the hand-loom, or preparing the  simple evening meal.    In character the Bedawin are dignified and reserved, and have a  great contempt for the noisiness so characteristic of the Egyptians,  but, like them, are passionately fond of their wives and children, and  so highly prize the various articles of saddlery or apparel made by  their hands that no money would buy them.    The men are tall, with strong aquiline features and keen eyes, which  look very piercing beneath the \"cufia,\"[10] which is wrapped around  their heads; their clothing is loose and flowing, a black \"arbiyeh\"  being worn over the \"khaftan,\" or inner robe, of white or coloured  stripes, and their boots are of soft leather. Though the traditional  spear is still retained, all are armed with some firearm--ancient  flint-locks of great length, or more commonly nowadays with a modern  rifle, and many of the sheykhs wear a long, curved sword of beautiful  workmanship, which is slung across their shoulders by a silken cord.  All have strong, deep voices, and impress you with the idea that these  are manly and courageous fellows, and upright according to their  lights.    [Footnote 10: A square shawl of white or coloured silk.]    The women also are clothed in loose draperies, the outer one of some  rough material, which conceals others of daintier fabric and colour.  Handsome in feature, with glossy blue-black hair, their dark gipsy  faces also wear that look of sturdy independence which so becomes the  men.    It may naturally be asked, \"How do these people occupy their time?\"  First of all, they have large flocks, which must be fed and watered,  and they are thus compelled to wander from well to well, or from one  oasis to another, and they are also great breeders of horses, which  must be carefully looked after, and from time to time taken to some  far away fair for sale. Food and water also have often to be brought  long distances to their camps by the camel-men, while the women are  occupied with their domestic duties and their weaving.    Naturally the Bedawin are expert horsemen, and are very fond of  equestrian sports. Some of their fancy riding is very clever, and  great rivalry exists among them, particularly in their \"jerid,\" or  javelin, play, when frequently several hundreds of mounted men are  engaged in a melee, which, though only intended to be a friendly  contest, often results in serious injury or death to many.    The Arab is very fond of his horse, which he himself has bred and  trained from a colt, and his affection is amply returned by his  steed. They are beautiful animals, strong and fleet-footed, but often  savage with anyone but their master.    Sport enters largely into the life of the Bedawin, and many tribes  train falcons, with which they hunt gazelles, and in the Lybian desert  the \"cheetah,\" or hunting leopard, is tamed and used for the same  purpose, and in this way the monotony of many a long desert march is  relieved.    When on a journey smaller tents than those which I have described are  used, all the heavy baggage being loaded on to camels, upon which the  women and children also ride. Camels have often been called the \"ships  of the desert,\" and they are certainly the most useful of all animals  for such travelling, for their broad pads prevent their feet from  sinking into the soft sand, and not only do they carry enormous loads,  but are able for days together to go without food or water. When  Abraham sent his servant to seek a wife for Isaac, it was on camels  that he travelled, and shaded, no doubt, by her canopy of shawls, it  was on camel-back that Rebekah returned with him to the tent of his  master. So to-day we may often meet a similar party on their journey,  the women seated beneath the \"mahmal,\" as the canopy is called, while  the food and water for the journey is slung from the saddles of the  camels ridden by the armed men who form their escort.    Camels are of two kinds--the heavily-built beast, such as we see in  Egypt, and which is used for baggage purposes, and the \"hagin,\" or  dromedary, used solely for riding. Lest any of my readers should fall  into the common error of supposing that the dromedary has two humps,  let me say that the only difference between it and the ordinary camel  is that it is smaller and better bred, just as our racehorses differ  from draught animals, and must not be confounded with the Bactrian or  two-humped camel of Asia. These hagin are very fleet, and often  cover great distances, and I have known one to travel as much as 100  miles between sunset and sunrise!    On a journey the pace of a caravan is that of its slowest beast, and  very arduous such journeys often are, for there is no shade, and the  dust raised by the caravan envelops the slowly moving travellers,  while the fierce sun is reflected from the rocks, which often become  too hot to touch. On the other hand, the nights are often bitterly  cold, for the sand is too loose to retain any of its heat, while the  salt with which the desert is strongly impregnated has a chilling  effect on the air. Most trying of all, however, are the hot desert  winds, which often last for days together, drying up the water in the  skins, while the distressed travellers are half suffocated by the dust  and flying sand which cut the skin like knives. Little wonder,  therefore, if these hardy desert tribes are taciturn and reserved, for  they see nature in its stern moods, and know little of that ease of  life which may be experienced among the green crops and pastures of  the Delta.    It must not be supposed that the Bedawin are morose, for beneath  their outward severity lies a great power for sympathy and affection.  The love of the Arab for his horse is proverbial, and his kindness to  all dumb animals is remarkable.    Like the Egyptian, family affection holds him strongly, and he has a  keen appreciation of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18674"],[0,"A Chinese Wonder Book (#13)"],[1,"?\" asked Bamboo. \"I have never  studied geography.\"    \"We must cross China, then Thibet, and at last in the mountains just  beyond we shall reach the spot which P'anku made the centre of his  labour.\"    At that moment Bamboo felt himself being lifted from the ground. At  first he thought he would slip off the turtle's rounded shell, and he  cried out in fright.    \"Never fear,\" said his friend. \"Only sit quietly, and there will be no  danger.\"    They had now risen far into the air, and Bamboo could look down over the  great forest of Hsi Ling all bathed in moonlight. There were the broad  white roads leading up to the royal tombs, the beautiful temples, the  buildings where oxen and sheep were prepared for sacrifice, the lofty  towers, and the high tree-covered hills under which the emperors were  buried. Until that night Bamboo had not known the size of this royal  graveyard. Could it be that the turtle would carry him beyond the  forest? Even as he asked himself this question he saw that they had  reached a mountain, and the turtle was ascending higher, still higher,  to cross the mighty wall of stone.    Bamboo grew dizzy as the turtle rose farther into the sky. He felt as he  sometimes did when he played whirling games with his little friends, and  got so dizzy that he tumbled over upon the ground. However, this time  he knew that he must keep his head and not fall, for it must have been  almost a mile to the ground below him. At last they had passed over the  mountain and were flying above a great plain. Far below Bamboo could see  sleeping villages and little streams of water that looked like silver  in the moonlight. Now, directly beneath them was a city. A few feeble  lights could be seen in the dark narrow streets, and Bamboo thought he  could hear the faint cries of peddlers crying their midnight wares.    \"That's the capital of Shan-shi just below us,\" said the turtle,  breaking his long silence. \"It is almost two hundred miles from here to  your father's house, and we have taken less than half an hour. Beyond  that is the Province of the Western Valleys. In one hour we shall be  above Thibet.\"    On they whizzed at lightning speed. If it had not been hot summer time  Bamboo would have been almost frozen. As it was, his hands and feet were  cold and stiff. The turtle, as if knowing how chilly he was, flew nearer  to the ground where it was warmer. How pleasant for Bamboo! He was so  tired that he could keep his eyes open no longer and he was soon soaring  in the land of dreams.    When he waked up it was morning. He was lying on the ground in a wild,  rocky region. Not far away burned a great wood fire, and the turtle was  watching some food that was cooking in a pot.    \"Ho, ho, my lad! so you have at last waked up after your long ride. You  see we are a little early. No matter if the dragon does think he can fly  faster, I beat him, didn't I? Why, even the phoenix laughs at me and  says I am slow, but the phoenix has not come yet either. Yes, I have  clearly broken the record for speed, and I had a load to carry too,  which neither of the others had, I am sure.\"    \"Where are we?\" questioned Bamboo.    \"In the land of the beginning,\" said the other wisely. \"We flew over  Thibet, and then went northwest for two hours. If you haven't studied  geography you won't know the name of the country. But, here we are, and  that is enough, isn't it, enough for any one? And to-day is the yearly  feast-day in honour of the making of the world. It was very fortunate  for me that the gates were left open yesterday. I am afraid my old  friends, the dragon and the phoenix, have almost forgotten what I look  like. It is so long since they saw me. Lucky beasts they are, not to be  loaded down under an emperor's tablet. Hello! I hear the dragon coming  now, if I am not mistaken. Yes, here he is. How glad I am to see him!\"    Bamboo heard a great noise like the whirr of enormous wings, and then,  looking up, saw a huge dragon just in front of him. He knew it was a  dragon from the pictures he had seen and the carvings in the temples.    The dragon and the turtle had no sooner greeted each other, both very  happy at the meeting, than they were joined by a queer-looking bird,  unlike any that Bamboo had ever seen, but which he knew was the  phoenix. This phoenix looked somewhat like a wild swan, but it had  the bill of a cock, the neck of a snake, the tail of a fish and the  stripes of a dragon. Its feathers were of five colours.    When the three friends had chatted merrily for a few minutes, the turtle  told them how Bamboo had helped him to escape from the temple.    \"A clever boy,\" said the dragon, patting Bamboo gently on the back.    \"Yes, yes, a clever boy indeed,\" echoed the phoenix.    \"Ah,\" sighed the turtle, \"if only the good god, P'anku, were here,  shouldn't we be happy! But, I fear he will never come to this  meeting-place. No doubt he is off in some distant spot, cutting out  another world. If I could only see him once more, I feel that I should  die in peace.\"    \"Just listen!\" laughed the dragon. \"As if one of us could die! Why, you  talk like a mere mortal.\"    All day long the three friends chatted, feasted, and had a good time  looking round at the places where they had lived so happily when P'anku  had been cutting out the world. They were good to Bamboo also and showed  him many wonderful things of which he had never dreamed.    \"You are not half so mean-looking and so fierce as they paint you on the  flags,\" said Bamboo in a friendly voice to the dragon just as they were  about to separate.    The three friends laughed heartily.    \"Oh, no, he's a very decent sort of fellow, even if he is covered with  fish-scales,\" joked the phoenix.    Just before they bade each other good-bye, the phoenix gave Bamboo a  long scarlet tail-feather for a keepsake, and the dragon gave him a  large scale which turned to gold as soon as the boy took it into his  hand.    \"Come, come, we must hurry,\" said the turtle. \"I am afraid your father  will think you are lost.\" So Bamboo, after having spent the happiest day  of his life, mounted the turtle's back, and they rose once more above  the clouds. Back they flew even faster than they had come. Bamboo had so  many things to talk about that he did not once think of going to sleep,  for he had really seen the dragon and the phoenix, and if he never  were to see anything else in his life, he would always be happy.    Suddenly the turtle stopped short in his swift flight, and Bamboo felt  himself slipping. Too late he screamed for help, too late he tried to  save himself. Down, down from that dizzy height he tumbled, turning,  twisting, thinking of the awful death that was surely coming. Swish!  he shot through the tree tops trying vainly to clutch the friendly  branches. Then with a loud scream he struck the ground, and his long  journey was ended.    [Illustration: \"AH,\" SIGHED THE TURTLE, \"IF ONLY THE GOOD GOD, P'ANKU,  WERE HERE.\"]    \"Come out from under that turtle, boy! What are you doing inside the  temple in the dirt? Don't you know this is not the proper place for  you?\"    Bamboo rubbed his eyes. Though only half awake, he knew it was his  father's voice.    \"But didn't it kill me?\" he said as his father pulled him out by the  heel from under the great stone turtle.    \"What killed you, foolish boy? What can you be talking about? But I'll  half-kill you if you don't hurry out of this and come to your supper.  Really I believe you are getting too lazy to eat. The idea of sleeping  the whole afternoon under that turtle's belly!\"    Bamboo, not yet fully awake, stumbled out of the tablet room, and his  father locked the iron doors.          THE MAD GOOSE AND THE TIGER FOREST    [Illustration]      Hu-lin was a little slave girl. She had been sold by her father when  she was scarcely more than a baby, and had lived for five years with  a number of other children in a wretched houseboat. Her cruel master  treated her very badly. He made her go out upon the street, with the  other girls he had bought, to beg for a living. This kind of life was  especially hard for Hu-lin. She longed to play in the fields, above  which the huge kites were sailing in the air like giant birds. She liked  to see the crows and magpies flying hither and thither. It was great fun  to watch them build their stick nests in the tall poplars. But if her  master ever caught her idling her time away in this manner he beat her  most cruelly and gave her nothing to eat for a whole day. In fact he was  so wicked and cruel that all the children called him Black Heart.    Early one morning when Hu-lin was feeling very sad about the way she was  treated, she resolved to run away, but, alas! she had not gone more than  a hundred yards from the houseboat when she saw Black Heart following  her. He caught her, scolded her most dreadfully, and gave her such a  beating that she felt too faint to stir.    For several hours she lay on the ground without moving a muscle, moaning  as if her heart would break. \"Ah! if only someone would save me!\" she  thought, \"how good I would be all the rest of my days!\"    Now, not far from the river there lived an old man in a tumble-down  shanty. The only companion he had was a goose that watched the gate for  him at night and screamed out loudly if any stranger dared to prowl  about the place. Hu-lin and this goose were close friends, and the slave  girl often stopped to chat with the wise fowl as she was passing the old  man's cottage. In this way she had learned that the bird's owner was a  miser who kept a great deal of money hidden in his yard. Ch'ang, the  goose, had an unusually long neck, and was thus able to pry into most of  his master's affairs. As the fowl had no member of his own family to  talk with, he told all he knew to Hu-lin.    On the very morning when Black Heart gave Hu-lin a beating for trying  to run away, Ch'ang made a startling discovery. His"]]]
