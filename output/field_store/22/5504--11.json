[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14339"],[0,"Music Talks with Children (#13)"],[1,"Gottfried lived in Vienna with his father, and to  their house Mozart often went. At this time Mozart had an album in  which his friends were invited to write. Among the verses is a  sentiment written by Gottfried von Jacquin, saying:    \"True genius is impossible without heart; no amount of intellect alone  or of imagination, no, nor of both together, can make genius. Love is  the soul of genius.\"    Here we have the same truth told us which we have already found for  ourselves, namely, that all good music comes from the heart. We have  found it by studying music and striving faithfully to get deep into  its real meaning. But to-day we have the words of one who was enabled  to watch closely as a friend one of the greatest composers that ever  lived. And being much with him, hearing the music of the master played  by the master himself, put the thought into his head, that it is  impossible to be a true genius without heart and love.    From this we shall have courage to know that what we pursue in music  is real; that the beauties of great music, though they may just now be  beyond us, are true, and exist to those who are prepared for them.  When in our struggle to be more capable in art than we are to-day we  think of the beauty around us, and desire to be worthy of it, we are  then forming an ideal, and ideals are only of value when we strive to  live up to them.    Once in Rome there lived a Greek slave--some day you may read his  name. He has told us, that \"if thou wouldst have aught of good, have  it from thyself.\"[61] Of course we see in this, immediately, the truth  that has been spoken of in nearly every one of these Talks. It is  this: We must, day by day, become better acquainted with ourselves,  study our thoughts, have purity of heart, and work for something.    Now, working for something may be accomplished in a simple manner  without thinking of it. If every task is done in our best way it adds  something to us. It is true and beautiful, too, that the reward for  patient, faithful work comes silently to us, and often we do not know  of its presence. But some day, finding ourselves stronger, we look to  know the cause of it, and we see that the faithfulness of past days  has aided us.    So art teaches us a very practical lesson in the beginning. If we  would have her favors we must do her labors. If we say to music: \"I  should love to know you;\" music says to us, \"Very well, work and your  wish shall be gratified.\" But without that labor we cannot have that  wish. The Greek slave knew that and said:    \"Thou art unjust, if thou desire to gain those things for nothing.\"    Now we begin to see that art has no gifts to bestow upon us for  nothing. Many think it has, and pursue it until the truth dawns upon  them; then, because of their error, they dislike it. To recognize the  truth about art and to pursue that truth, despite the hard road, is to  have courage. And the Ideal is nothing else than the constant presence  of this truth.    And what do we gain by pursuing it? Not common pleasure, but true  happiness; not uncertainty, but true understanding; not selfish life,  but true and full life. And we can see the beauty of art in nothing  more plainly than in the fact that all these things may come to a  child, and a new and brighter life is made possible by them.    The very first day we came together, the little child said to the  master:    \"Master, I do not understand what thou hast said, yet I believe thee.\"    It is hard, sometimes, to feel the truth and to keep it with us; hard,  not only for a child, but for any one; and yet, if with faith we will  labor with it _until the light comes_, then we are truly rewarded and  made richer according to our faith.    We must not forget in the first days, as we leave our music, that the  path we have taken since we came together is the hardest; not for  always, but for now. The right path is hard at first--the wrong one is  hard always.    We will understand it all better in other days if we remain faithful  now. If, however, we should forget for a moment that art demands our  loyalty, there will be no joy or peace in it for us. Worse, perhaps,  than starting out upon the wrong path, is the deserting of the right  one. Sometimes out of impatience we do this; out of impatience and  self-love, which is the worst of all. \"Truth is the beginning of all  good, and the greatest of all evils is self-love.\"[62]    With the trials that music costs us, with its pains and  discouragements, we might easily doubt all these promises which are  contained in our ideals, but we shall be forever saved from deserting  them if we remember that these ideals have been persistently held by  great men. They have never given them up. One of the strongest  characteristics of Bach and of Beethoven was their determination to  honor their thoughts. Sometimes we find the same persistence and  faithfulness in lesser men.    I am sure you will see this faith beautifully lived in the few facts  we have about the life of Johann Christian Kittel, a pupil of Bach,  and it is strongly brought out by the pretty story told of him, that  when pleased with a pupil's work he would draw aside a curtain which  covered a portrait of Bach and let the faithful one gaze upon it for a  moment. That was to him the greatest reward he could give for  faithfulness in the music task.    And this reminds us of how the teacher, Pistocchi, who, in teaching  the voice, kept in mind a pure tone, a quiet manner of singing, and  the true artistic way of doing. Among his pupils was a certain Antonio  Bernacchi, who, after leaving his master, began to display his voice  by runs and trills and meaningless tones. And this he did, not because  of true art, for that was not it, but because it brought him the  applause of unthinking people.    Once, when the master, Pistocchi, heard him do this he is said to have  exclaimed: \"Ah, I taught thee how to _sing_, and now thou wilt  _play_;\" meaning that the true song was gone and the pupil no longer  sang out of the heart, but merely out of the throat. Pistocchi kept  his ideal pure.    We have then among our ideals two of first importance. The ideal  perception of music, as being the true heart-expression of great men;  and the ideal of our doings, which is the true heart-expression of  ourselves. And to keep these ideals is difficult in two ways: The  difficulty of keeping the pure intention of great men ever before us,  and the difficulty of keeping close and faithful to the tasks assigned  us. Then we can say with the little child:    \"Master, I do not understand what thou hast said, yet I believe thee.\"          CHAPTER XX.    THE ONE TALENT.        \"Then he which had received the one talent came.\"--_Matthew, XXV:    24._    Some day, when you read about the great composers, you will be  delighted with the pictures of their home-life. You will see how they  employed music every day. In all cases, as we study them, we learn how  very much they have sacrificed for the music they love, studying it  daily because of the joy which it yields them. We see them as little  children, eager to be taught, wanting to listen to music, and to hear  about it. Many of the composers whose child-life is thus interesting  were children in very poor families, where things were neither fine  nor beautiful, where the necessary things of life were not plentiful,  and where all had to be careful and saving so that every bit should be  made to go as far as possible. The eagerness and determination of some  children in music-history is really wonderful. It is the true  determination. And you are not surprised, in following it, to note  that it leads the children who have it into lives of great usefulness.    All through the life of Handel we find determination running like a  golden thread. He was just as determined to be a musician as Lincoln  was to get an education when he read books by the firelight. Handel's  father was a surgeon, and knew so little about music that he failed  entirely to understand the child. He not only forbade the boy to study  music, but even kept him away from school that he might not by any  chance learn to read the notes. But one who was in future years to  befriend homeless children and to write wondrous music for all the  world could not be held back by such devices. By some means, and with  friendly assistance (perhaps his mother's), he succeeded in smuggling  into the garret a spinet, which is a kind of piano. By placing cloth  upon the strings he so deadened the wires that no one downstairs could  hear the tones when the spinet was played. And day after day this  little lad would sit alone in his garret, learning more and more about  the wonders which his heart and his head told him were in the tiny  half-dumb spinet before him. Not the more cheerful rooms down-stairs  nor the games of his playmates drew him away from the music he loved,  the music which he felt in his heart, remember.    One would expect such determination to show itself in many ways. It  did. Handel does not disappoint us in this. All through his life he  had strong purposes and a strong will--concentration--which led him  forward. You know how he followed his father's coach once. Perhaps it  was disobedience,--but what a fine thing happened when he reached the  duke's palace and played the organ. From that day every one knew that  his life would be devoted to music. Sometimes at home, sometimes in  foreign lands, he was always working, thinking, learning. He is said,  in his boyhood, to have copied large quantities of music, and to have  composed something every week. This copying made him better acquainted  with other music, and the early habit of composition made it easy for  him to write his thoughts in after years. Indeed, so skilled did he  become, that he wrote one opera--\"Rinaldo\"--in fourteen days, and the  \"Messiah\" was written in twenty-four days.[63]    Yet parts of his great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14360"],[0,"The Dawn and the Day (#13)"],[1," worldly wealth, his staff and bowl,    Obedient to that voice he left his cave;    When from a shepherd's cottage near his way,    Whence he had often heard the busy hum    Of industry, and childhood's merry laugh,    There came the angry, stern command of one    Clothed in a little brief authority,    Mingled with earnest pleadings, and the wail    Of women's voices, and above them all    The plaintive treble of a little child.    Thither he turned, and when he reached the spot,    The cause of all this sorrow was revealed:    One from the king had seized their little all,    Their goats and sheep, and e'en the child's pet lamb.    But when they saw him they had often watched    With reverent awe, as if come down from heaven,    Prostrate they fell, and kissed his garment's hem,    While he so insolent, now stood abashed,    And, self accused, he thus excused himself:    \"The Brahmans make this day a sacrifice,    And they demand unblemished goats and lambs.    I but obey the king's express command    To bring them to the temple ere high noon.\"    But Buddha stooped and raised the little child,    Who nestled in his arms in perfect trust,    And gently said: \"Rise up, my friends, weep not!    The king must be obeyed--but kings have hearts.    I go along to be your advocate.    The king may spare what zealous priest would kill,    Thinking the gods above delight in blood.\"    But when the officers would drive the flock    With staves and slings and loud and angry cries,    They only scattered them among the rocks,    And Buddha bade the shepherd call his own,    As love can lead where force in vain would drive.    He called; they knew his voice and followed him,    Dumb innocents, down to the slaughter led,    While Buddha kissed the child, and followed them,    With those so late made insolent by power,    Now dumb as if led out to punishment.      Meanwhile the temple-gates wide open stood,    And when the king, in royal purple robed,    And decked with gems, attended by his court,    To clash of cymbals, sound of shell and drum,    Through streets swept clean and sprinkled with perfumes,    Adorned with flags, and filled with shouting crowds,    Drew near the sacred shrine, a greater came,    Through unswept ways, where dwelt the toiling poor,    Huddled in wretched huts, breathing foul air,    Living in fetid filth and poverty--    No childhood's joys, youth prematurely old,    Manhood a painful struggle but to live,    And age a weary shifting of the scene;    While all the people drew aside to gaze    Upon his gentle but majestic face,    Beaming with tender, all-embracing love.    And when the king and royal train dismount,    'Mid prostrate people and the stately priests,    On fragrant flowers that carpeted his way,    And mount the lofty steps to reach the shrine,    Siddartha came, upon the other side,    'Mid stalls for victims, sheds for sacred wood,    And rude attendants on the pompous rites,    Who seized a goat, the patriarch of the flock,    And bound him firm with sacred munja grass,    And bore aloft, while Buddha followed where    A priest before the blazing altar stood    With glittering knife, and others fed the fires,    While clouds of incense from the altar rose,    Sweeter than Araby the blest can yield,    And white-robed Brahmans chant their sacred hymns.    And there before that ancient shrine they met,    The king, the priests, the hermit from the hill,    When one, an aged Brahman, raised his hands,    And praying, lifted up his voice and cried:    \"O hear! great Indra, from thy lofty throne    On Meru's holy mountain, high in heaven.    Let every good the king has ever done    With this sweet incense mingled rise to thee;    And every secret, every open sin    Be laid upon this goat, to sink from sight,    Drunk by the earth with his hot spouting blood,    Or on this altar with his flesh be burned.\"    And all the Brahman choir responsive cried:    \"Long live the king! now let the victim die!\"    But Buddha said: \"Let him not strike, O king!    For how can God, being good, delight in blood?    And how can blood wash out the stains of sin,    And change the fixed eternal law of life    That good from good, evil from evil flows?\"    This said, he stooped and loosed the panting goat,    None staying him, so great his presence was.    And then with loving tenderness he taught    How sin works out its own sure punishment;    How like corroding rust and eating moth    It wastes the very substance of the soul;    Like poisoned blood it surely, drop by drop,    Pollutes the very fountain of the life;    Like deadly drug it changes into stone    The living fibres of a loving heart;    Like fell disease, it breeds within the veins    The living agents of a living death;    And as in gardens overgrown with weeds,    Nothing but patient labor, day by day,    Uprooting cherished evils one by one,    Watering its soil with penitential tears,    Can fit the soul to grow that precious seed,    Which taking root, spreads out a grateful shade    Where gentle thoughts like singing birds may lodge,    Where pure desires like fragrant flowers may bloom,    And loving acts like ripened fruits may hang.    Then, chiding not, with earnest words he urged    Humanity to man, kindness to beasts,    Pure words, kind acts, in all our daily walks.    As better than the blood of lambs and goats.    Better than incense or the chanted hymn,    To cleanse the heart and please the powers above,    And fill the world with harmony and peace,    Till pricked in heart, the priest let fall his knife;    The Brahmans listening, ceased to chant their hymns;    The king drank in his words with eager ears;    And from that day no altar dripped with blood,    But flowers instead breathed forth their sweet perfumes.    And when that troubled day drew near its close,    Joy filled once more that shepherd's humble home,    From door to door his simple story flew,    And when the king entered his palace gates,    New thoughts were surging in his wakened soul.      But though the beasts have lairs, the birds have nests,    Buddha had not whereon to lay his head,    Not even a mountain-cave to call his home;    And forth he fared, heedless about his way--    For every way was now alike to him.    Heedless of food, his alms-bowl hung unused.    While all the people stood aside with awe,    And to their children pointed out the man    Who plead the shepherd's cause before the king.    At length he passed the city's western gate,    And crossed the little plain circling its walls.    Circled itself by five bold hills that rise,    A rugged, rampart and an outer wall.    Two outer gates this mountain rampart had,    The one a narrow valley opening west    Toward Gaya, through the red Barabar hills.    Through which the rapid Phalgu swiftly glides,    Down from the Vindhya mountains far away,    Then gently winds around this fruitful plain,    Its surface green with floating lotus leaves.    And bright with lotus blossoms, blue and white,    O'erhung with drooping trees and trailing vines,    Till through the eastern gate it hastens on,    To lose itself in Gunga's sacred stream.      Toward Gaya now Siddartha bent his steps,    Distant the journey of a single day    As men marked distance in those ancient times,    No longer heeded in this headlong age,    When we count moments by the miles we pass;    And one may see the sun sink out of sight.    Behind great banks of gray and wintry clouds,    While feathery snowflakes fill the frosty air,    And after quiet sleep may wake next day    To see it bathe green fields with floods of light,    And dry the sparkling dew from opening flowers,    And hear the joyful burst of vernal song,    And breathe the balmy air of opening spring.      And as he went, weary and faint and sad,    The valley opening showed a pleasant grove,    Where many trees mingled their grateful shade,    And many blossoms blended sweet perfumes;    And there, under a drooping vakul-tree,    A bower of roses and sweet jasmine vines,    Within a couch, without a banquet spread,    While near a fountain with its falling spray    Ruffled the surface of a shining pool,    Whose liquid cadence mingled with the songs    Of many birds concealed among the trees.      And there three seeming sister graces were,[2]    Fair as young Venus rising from the sea,    The one in seeming childlike innocence    Bathed in the pool, while her low liquid laugh    Rung sweet and clear; and one her vina tuned,    And as she played, the other lightly danced,    Clapping her hands, tinkling her silver bells,    Whose gauzy silken garments seemed to show    Rather than hide her slender, graceful limbs.    And she who played the vina sweetly sang;          \"Come to our bower and take your rest--        Life is a weary road at best.        Eat, for your board is richly spread;        Drink, for your wine is sparkling red;        Rest, for the weary day is past;        Sleep, for the shadows gather fast.        Tune not your vina-strings too high,        Strained they will break and the music die.        Come to our bower and take your rest--        Life is a weary road at best.\"      But Buddha, full of pity, passing said:    \"Alas, poor soul! flitting a little while    Like painted butterflies before the lamp    That soon will burn your wings; like silly doves,    Calling the cruel kite to seize and kill;    Displaying lights to be the robber's guide;    Enticing men to wrong, who soon despise.    Ah! poor, perverted, cold and cruel world!    Delights of love become the lures of lust,    The joys of heaven changed into fires of hell.\"      [1]I am aware there are many who think that Buddha did not believe in  prayer, which Arnold puts into his own mouth in these words, which  sound like the clanking of chains in a prison-vault:      \"Pray not! the darkness will not brighten!  Ask    Nought from Silence, for it cannot speak!\"    Buddha did"]]]
