Day and night I pray to Heaven for you that strength may be yours, and  that, one and all, you may participate in the blessings of Baha'u'llah,  and enter into the Kingdom.

I counsel you that you study earnestly the teachings of Baha'u'llah, so  that, God helping you, you may in deed and truth become Baha'is.          CONCERNING BODY, SOUL AND SPIRIT      4 Avenue de Camoeens, Paris,  Friday morning, November 17th    There are in the world of humanity three degrees; those of the body, the  soul, and spirit.    The body is the physical or animal degree of man. From the bodily point of  view man is a sharer of the animal kingdom. The bodies alike of men and  animals are composed of elements held together by the law of attraction.    Like the animal, man possesses the faculties of the senses, is subject to  heat, cold, hunger, thirst, etc.; unlike the animal, man has a rational  soul, the human intelligence.    This intelligence of man is the intermediary between his body and his  spirit.    When man allows the spirit, through his soul, to enlighten his  understanding, then does he contain all Creation; because man, being the  culmination of all that went before and thus superior to all previous  evolutions, contains all the lower world within himself. Illumined by the  spirit through the instrumentality of the soul, man's radiant intelligence  makes him the crowning-point of Creation.    But on the other hand, when man does not open his mind and heart to the  blessing of the spirit, but turns his soul towards the material side,  towards the bodily part of his nature, then is he fallen from his high  place and he becomes inferior to the inhabitants of the lower animal  kingdom. In this case the man is in a sorry plight! For if the spiritual  qualities of the soul, open to the breath of the Divine Spirit, are never  used, they become atrophied, enfeebled, and at last incapable; whilst the  soul's material qualities alone being exercised, they become terribly  powerful--and the unhappy, misguided man, becomes more savage, more unjust,  more vile, more cruel, more malevolent than the lower animals themselves.  All his aspirations and desires being strengthened by the lower side of  the soul's nature, he becomes more and more brutal, until his whole being  is in no way superior to that of the beasts that perish. Men such as this,  plan to work evil, to hurt and to destroy; they are entirely without the  spirit of Divine compassion, for the celestial quality of the soul has  been dominated by that of the material. If, on the contrary, the spiritual  nature of the soul has been so strengthened that it holds the material  side in subjection, then does the man approach the Divine; his humanity  becomes so glorified that the virtues of the Celestial Assembly are  manifested in him; he radiates the Mercy of God, he stimulates the  spiritual progress of mankind, for he becomes a lamp to show light on  their path.    You perceive how the soul is the intermediary between the body and the  spirit. In like manner is this tree(11) the intermediary between the seed  and the fruit. When the fruit of the tree appears and becomes ripe, then  we know that the tree is perfect; if the tree bore no fruit it would be  merely a useless growth, serving no purpose!    When a soul has in it the life of the spirit, then does it bring forth  good fruit and become a Divine tree. I wish you to try to understand this  example. I hope that the unspeakable goodness of God will so strengthen  you that the celestial quality of your soul, which relates it to the  spirit, will for ever dominate the material side, so entirely ruling the  senses that your soul will approach the perfections of the Heavenly  Kingdom. May your faces, being steadfastly set towards the Divine Light,  become so luminous that all your thoughts, words and actions will shine  with the Spiritual Radiance dominating your souls, so that in the  gatherings of the world you will show perfection in your life.    Some men's lives are solely occupied with the things of this world; their  minds are so circumscribed by exterior manners and traditional interests  that they are blind to any other realm of existence, to the spiritual  significance of all things! They think and dream of earthly fame, of  material progress. Sensuous delights and comfortable surroundings bound  their horizon, their highest ambitions centre in successes of worldly  conditions and circumstances! They curb not their lower propensities; they  eat, drink, and sleep! Like the animal, they have no thought beyond their  own physical well-being. It is true that these necessities must be  despatched. Life is a load which must be carried on while we are on earth,  but the cares of the lower things of life should not be allowed to  monopolize all the thoughts and aspirations of a human being. The heart's  ambitions should ascend to a more glorious goal, mental activity should  rise to higher levels! Men should hold in their souls the vision of  celestial perfection, and there prepare a dwelling-place for the  inexhaustible bounty of the Divine Spirit.    Let your ambition be the achievement on earth of a Heavenly civilization!  I ask for you the supreme blessing, that you may be so filled with the  vitality of the Heavenly Spirit that you may be the cause of life to the  world.          THE BAHA'IS MUST WORK WITH HEART AND SOUL TO BRING ABOUT A BETTER  CONDITION IN THE WORLD      November 19th    How joyful it is to see such a meeting as this, for it is in truth a  gathering together of 'heavenly men'.    We are all united in one Divine purpose, no material motive is ours, and  our dearest wish is to spread the Love of God throughout the world!    We work and pray for the unity of mankind, that all the races of the earth  may become one race, all the countries one country, and that all hearts  may beat as one heart, working together for perfect unity and brotherhood.    Praise be to God that our efforts are sincere and that our hearts are  turned to the Kingdom. Our greatest longing is that truth may be  established in the world, and in this hope we draw near to one another in  love and affection. Each and all are whole-hearted and selfless, willing  to sacrifice all personal ambition to the grand ideal towards which they  strive: Brotherly love and peace and union among men!    Doubt not that God is with us, on our right hand and on our left, that day  by day He will cause our numbers to increase, and that our meetings will  grow in strength and usefulness.    It is my dearest hope that you may all become a blessing to others, that  you may give sight to the spiritually blind, hearing to the spiritually  deaf and life to those who are dead in sin.    May you help those sunk in materiality to realize their Divine son-ship,  and encourage them to arise and be worthy of their birthright; so that by  your endeavour the world of humanity may become the Kingdom of God and of  His elect.    I thank God that we are at one in this grand ideal, that my longings are  also yours and that we work together in perfect unity.    Today, upon the earth, one sees the sad spectacle of cruel war! Man slays  his brother man for selfish gain, and to enlarge his territories! For this  ignoble ambition hate has taken possession of his heart, and more and more  blood is shed!    Fresh battles are fought, the armies are increased, more cannon, more  guns, more explosives of all kinds are sent out--so does bitterness and  hate augment from day to day!    But this assembly, thank God, longs only for peace and unity, and must  work with heart and soul to bring about a better condition in the world.    You who are the servants of God fight against oppression, hate and  discord, so that wars may cease and God's laws of peace and love may be  established among men.    Work! Work with all your strength, spread the Cause of the Kingdom among  men; teach the self-sufficient to turn humbly towards God, the sinful to  sin no more, and await with glad expectation the coming of the Kingdom.    Love and obey your Heavenly Father, and rest assured that Divine help is  yours. Verily I say unto you that you shall indeed conquer the world!    Only have faith, patience and courage--this is but the beginning, but  surely you will succeed, for God is with you!          ON CALUMNY      Monday, November 20th    From the beginning of the world until the present time each  'Manifestation'(12) sent from God has been opposed by an embodiment of the  'Powers of Darkness'.

Translated by Amin Banani    Today I am most happy, for I see here a gathering of the servants of God.  I see white and black sitting together. There are no whites and blacks  before God. All colors are one, and that is the color of servitude to God.  Scent and color are not important. The heart is important. If the heart is  pure, white or black or any color makes no difference. God does not look  at colors; He looks at the hearts. He whose heart is pure is better. He  whose character is better is more pleasing. He who turns more to the Abha  Kingdom is more advanced.    In the realm of existence colors are of no importance. Observe in the  mineral kingdom colors are not the cause of discord. In the vegetable  kingdom the colors of multicolored flowers are not the cause of discord.  Rather, colors are the cause of the adornment of the garden because a  single color has no appeal; but when you observe many-colored flowers,  there is charm and display.    The world of humanity, too, is like a garden, and humankind are like the  many-colored flowers. Therefore, different colors constitute an adornment.  In the same way, there are many colors in the realm of animals. Doves are  of many colors; nevertheless, they live in utmost harmony. They never look  at color; instead, they look at the species. How often white doves fly  with black ones. In the same way, other birds and varicolored animals  never look at color; they look at the species.    Now ponder this: Animals, despite the fact that they lack reason and  understanding, do not make colors the cause of conflict. Why should man,  who has reason, create conflict? This is wholly unworthy of him.  Especially white and black are the descendants of the same Adam; they  belong to one household. In origin they were one; they were the same  color. Adam was of one color. Eve had one color. All humanity is descended  from them. Therefore, in origin they are one. These colors developed later  due to climates and regions; they have no significance whatsoever.  Therefore, today I am very happy that white and black have gathered  together in this meeting. I hope this coming together and harmony reaches  such a degree that no distinctions shall remain between them, and they  shall be together in the utmost harmony and love.    But I wish to say one thing in order that the blacks may become grateful  to the whites and the whites become loving toward the blacks. If you go to  Africa and see the blacks of Africa, you will realize how much progress  you have made. Praise be to God! You are like the whites; there are no  great distinctions left. But the blacks of Africa are treated as servants.  The first proclamation of emancipation for the blacks was made by the  whites of America. How they fought and sacrificed until they freed the  blacks! Then it spread to other places. The blacks of Africa were in  complete bondage, but your emancipation led to their freedom also--that is,  the European states emulated the Americans, and the emancipation  proclamation became universal. It was for your sake that the whites of  America made such an effort. Were it not for this effort, universal  emancipation would not have been proclaimed.    Therefore, you must be very grateful to the whites of America, and the  whites must become very loving toward you so that you may progress in all  human grades. Strive jointly to make extraordinary progress and mix  together completely. In short, you must be very thankful to the whites who  were the cause of your freedom in America. Had you not been freed, other  blacks would not have been freed either. Now--praise be to God!--everyone is  free and lives in tranquillity. I pray that you attain to such a degree of  good character and behavior that the names of black and white shall  vanish. All shall be called human, just as the name for a flight of doves  is dove. They are not called black and white. Likewise with other birds.    I hope that you attain to such a high degree--and this is impossible except  through love. You must try to create love between yourselves; and this  love does not come about unless you are grateful to the whites, and the  whites are loving toward you, and endeavor to promote your advancement and  enhance your honor. This will be the cause of love. Differences between  black and white will be completely obliterated; indeed, ethnic and  national differences will all disappear.    I am very happy to see you and thank God that this meeting is composed of  people of both races and that both are gathered in perfect love and  harmony. I hope this becomes the example of universal harmony and love  until no title remains except that of humanity. Such a title demonstrates  the perfection of the human world and is the cause of eternal glory and  human happiness. I pray that you be with one another in utmost harmony and  love and strive to enable each other to live in comfort.          23 April 1912  Talk at Home of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur J. Parsons  1700 Eighteenth Street, NW, Washington, D.C.      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    Today I have been speaking from dawn until now, yet because of love,  fellowship and desire to be with you, I have come here to speak again  briefly. Within the last few days a terrible event has happened in the  world, an event saddening to every heart and grieving every spirit. I  refer to the Titanic disaster, in which many of our fellow human beings  were drowned, a number of beautiful souls passed beyond this earthly life.  Although such an event is indeed regrettable, we must realize that  everything which happens is due to some wisdom and that nothing happens  without a reason. Therein is a mystery; but whatever the reason and  mystery, it was a very sad occurrence, one which brought tears to many  eyes and distress to many souls. I was greatly affected by this disaster.  Some of those who were lost voyaged on the Cedric with us as far as Naples  and afterward sailed upon the other ship. When I think of them, I am very  sad indeed. But when I consider this calamity in another aspect, I am  consoled by the realization that the worlds of God are infinite; that  though they were deprived of this existence, they have other opportunities  in the life beyond, even as Christ has said, \"In my Father's house are  many mansions.\" They were called away from the temporary and transferred  to the eternal; they abandoned this material existence and entered the  portals of the spiritual world. Foregoing the pleasures and comforts of  the earthly, they now partake of a joy and happiness far more abiding and  real, for they have hastened to the Kingdom of God. The mercy of God is  infinite, and it is our duty to remember these departed souls in our  prayers and supplications that they may draw nearer and nearer to the  Source itself.    These human conditions may be likened to the matrix of the mother from  which a child is to be born into the spacious outer world. At first the  infant finds it very difficult to reconcile itself to its new existence.  It cries as if not wishing to be separated from its narrow abode and  imagining that life is restricted to that limited space. It is reluctant  to leave its home, but nature forces it into this world. Having come into  its new conditions, it finds that it has passed from darkness into a  sphere of radiance; from gloomy and restricted surroundings it has been  transferred to a spacious and delightful environment. Its nourishment was  the blood of the mother; now it finds delicious food to enjoy. Its new  life is filled with brightness and beauty; it looks with wonder and  delight upon the mountains, meadows and fields of green, the rivers and  fountains, the wonderful stars; it breathes the life-quickening  atmosphere; and then it praises God for its release from the confinement  of its former condition and attainment to the freedom of a new realm. This  analogy expresses the relation of the temporal world to the life  hereafter--the transition of the soul of man from darkness and uncertainty  to the light and reality of the eternal Kingdom. At first it is very  difficult to welcome death, but after attaining its new condition the soul  is grateful, for it has been released from the bondage of the limited to  enjoy the liberties of the unlimited. It has been freed from a world of  sorrow, grief and trials to live in a world of unending bliss and joy. The  phenomenal and physical have been abandoned in order that it may attain  the opportunities of the ideal and spiritual. Therefore, the souls of  those who have passed away from earth and completed their span of mortal  pilgrimage in the Titanic disaster have hastened to a world superior to  this. They have soared away from these conditions of darkness and dim  vision into the realm of light. These are the only considerations which  can comfort and console those whom they have left behind.    Furthermore, these events have deeper reasons. Their object and purpose is  to teach man certain lessons. We are living in a day of reliance upon  material conditions. Men imagine that the great size and strength of a  ship, the perfection of machinery or the skill of a navigator will ensure  safety, but these disasters sometimes take place that men may know that  God is the real Protector. If it be the will of God to protect man, a  little ship may escape destruction, whereas the greatest and most  perfectly constructed vessel with the best and most skillful navigator may  not survive a danger such as was present on the ocean. The purpose is that  the people of the world may turn to God, the One Protector; that human  souls may rely upon His preservation and know that He is the real safety.  These events happen in order that man's faith may be increased and"]]]
