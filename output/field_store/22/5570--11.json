Elinor does precisely what she wants to do. She  wears outlandish clothes. She smokes and--I'm afraid drinks. And  dances--_dreadfully._ Just like the other girls--no better, no worse.  But with all that I think she's good. I feel the same as Jane feels  about that. In spite of this--this modern stuff I believe all the  girls are fundamentally the same as ten years ago.\"    \"Well, that's where you mothers get in wrong,\" declared Mrs. Wrapp  with her vigorous bluntness. \"It's your pride. Just because they're  _your_ daughters they are above reproach.... What have you to say  about the war babies in town? Did you ever hear of _that_ ten years  ago? You bet you didn't. These girls are a speedy set. Some of them  are just wild for the sake of wildness. Most of them _have_ to stand  for things, or be left out altogether.\"    \"What in the world can we do?\" queried Mrs. Maynard, divided between  distress and chagrin.    \"The good Lord only knows,\" responded Mrs. Wrapp, herein losing her  assurance. \"Marriage would save most of them. But Helen doesn't want  to marry. She wants to paint pictures and be free.\"    \"Perhaps marriage is a solution,\" rejoined Mrs. Maynard thoughtfully.    \"Whom on earth can we marry them to?\" asked Mrs. Kingsley. \"Most of  the older men, the bachelors who're eligible haven't any use for these  girls except to _play_ with them. True, these young boys only think of  little but dances, car-rides, and sneaking off alone to spoon--they  get engaged to this girl and that one. But nothing comes of it.\"    \"You're wrong. Never in my time have I seen girls find lovers and  husbands as easily as now,\" declared Mrs. Wrapp. \"Nor get rid of them  so quickly.... Jane, you can marry Margaret. She's pretty and sweet  even if you have spoiled her. The years are slipping by. Margaret  ought to marry. She's not strong enough to work. Marriage for her  would make things so much easier for you.\"    With that parting dig Mrs. Wrapp rose to go. Whereupon she and Mrs.  Kingsley, with gracious words of invitation and farewell, took  themselves off leaving Mrs. Maynard contending with an outraged  spirit. Certain terse remarks of the crude and practical Mrs. Wrapp  had forced to her mind a question that of late had assumed cardinal  importance, and now had been brought to an issue by a proposal for  Margaret's hand. Her daughter was a great expense, really more than  could longer be borne in these times of enormous prices and shrunken  income. A husband had been found for Margaret, and the matter could be  adjusted easily enough, if the girl did not meet it with the  incomprehensible obstinacy peculiar to her of late.    Mrs. Maynard found the fair object of her hopes seated in the middle  of her room with the bright contents of numerous boxes and drawers  strewn in glittering heaps around her.    \"Margaret, what on earth are you doing there?\" she demanded.    \"I'm looking for a little picture Holt Dalrymple gave me when we went  to school together,\" responded Margaret.    \"Aren't you ever going to grow up? You'll be hunting for your dolls  next.\"    \"I will if I like,\" said the daughter, in a tone that did not manifest  a seraphic mood.    \"Don't you feel well?\" inquired the mother, solicitously. Margaret was  frail and subject to headaches that made her violent.    \"Oh, I'm well enough.\"    \"My dear,\" rejoined Mrs. Maynard, changing the topic. \"I'm sorry to  tell you Daren Lane has lost his standing in Middleville.\"    The hum and the honk of a motor-car sounded in the street.    \"Poor Daren! What's he done?... Any old day he'll care!\"    Mrs. Maynard was looking out of the window. \"Here comes a crowd of  girls.... Helen Wrapp has a new suit. Well, I'll go down. And after  they leave I want a serious talk with you.\"    \"Not if I see you first!\" muttered Margaret, under her breath, as her  mother walked out.    Presently, following gay talk and laughter down stairs, a bevy of  Margaret's friends entered her boudoir.    \"Hello, old socks!\" was Helen's greeting. \"You look punk.\"    \"Marg, where's the doll? Your mother tipped us off,\" was Elinor's  greeting.    \"Where's the eats?\" was Flossie Dickerson's greeting. She was a  bright-eyed girl, with freckles on her smiling face, and the  expression of a daring, vivacious and happy spirit--and acknowledged  to be the best dancer and most popular girl in Middleville. Her dress,  while not to be compared with her friends' costumes in costliness, yet  was extreme in the prevailing style.    \"Glad to see you, old dear,\" was dark-eyed, dark-haired Dorothy  Dalrymple's greeting. Her rich color bore no hint of the artificial.  She sank down on her knees beside Margaret.    The other girls draped themselves comfortably round the room; and  Flossie with a 'Yum Yum' began to dig into a box of candy on  Margaret's couch. They all talked at once. \"Hear the latest, Marg?\"    \"Look at Helen's spiffy suit!\"    \"Oh, money, money, what it will buy!\"    \"Money'll never buy _me_, I'll say.\"    \"Marg, who's been fermentin' round lately? Girls, get wise to the  flowers.\"    \"Hot dog! See Marg blush! That comes from being so pale. What are  rouge and lip-stick and powder for but to hide truth from our  masculine pursuers?\"    \"Floss, you haven't blushed for a million years.\"    It was Dorothy Dalrymple who silenced the idle badinage.    \"Marg, you rummaging in the past?\" she cried.    \"Yes, and I love it,\" replied Margaret. \"I haven't looked over this  stuff for years. Just to remember the things I did!... Here, Dal, is a  picture you once drew of our old teacher, Miss Hill.\"    Dorothy, whom the girls nicknamed \"Dal,\" gazed at the drawing with  amaze and regret.    \"She was a terror,\" continued Margaret. \"But Dal, you never had any  reason to draw such a horrible picture of her. You were her pet.\"    \"I wasn't,\" declared Dorothy.    \"Maybe you never knew Miss Hill adored you, Dal,\" interposed Elinor.  \"She was always holding you up as a paragon. Not in your lessons--for  you were a bonehead--but for deportment you were the class!\"    \"Dal, you were too good for this earth _then_, let alone these days,\"  said Margaret.    \"Miss Hill,\" mused Elinor, gazing at the caricature. \"That's not a  bad drawing. I remember Miss Hill never had any use for me. Small  wonder. She was an honest-to-God teacher. I think she wanted us to be  good.... Wonder how she got along with the kids that came after us.\"    \"I saw Amanda Hill the other day,\" spoke up Flossie. \"She looked worn  out. She was nice to me. I'll bet my shirt she'd like to have us back,  bad as we were.... These kids of to-day! My Gawd! they're the limit.  They paralyze _me_. I thought I was pretty fast. But compared to these  youngsters I'm tied to a post. My kid sister Joyce--Rose Clymer--Bessy  Bell!... Some kids, believe me. And take it from me, girls, these  dimple-kneed chickens are vamping the older boys.\"    \"They're all stuck on Bessy,\" said Helen.    Margaret squealed in delight. \"Girls, look here. Valentines! Did you  ever?... Look at them.... And what's this?... 'Wonders of  Nature--composition by Margaret Maynard.' Heavens! Did I write that?  And what's this sear and yellow document?\"    A slivery peal of laughter burst from Margaret.    \"Dal, here's one of your masterpieces, composed when you were  thirteen, and mooney over Daren Lane.\"    \"I? Never! I didn't write it,\" denied Dorothy, with color in her dark  cheeks.    \"Yes you did. It's signed--'Yours forever Dot Dalrymple.' ... Besides  I remember now Daren gave it to me. Said he wanted to prove he could  have other girls if he couldn't have me.\"    \"How chivalrous!\" exclaimed Dorothy, joining in the laugh.    \"Ah! here's what I've been hunting,\" declared Margaret, waving aloft a  small picture. \"It's a photograph of Holt, taken five years ago. Only  the other evening he swore I hadn't kept it--dared me to produce it.  He'll want it now--for some other girl. But nix, it's mine.... Dal,  isn't he a handsome boy here?\"    With sisterly impartiality Dorothy declared she could not in the  wildest flight of her imagination see her brother as handsome.    \"Holt used to be good-looking,\" said she. \"But he outgrew it. That  South Carolina training camp and the flu changed his looks as well as  his disposition.\"    \"Holt _is_ changed,\" mused Margaret, gazing down at the picture, and  the glow faded from her face.    \"Dare Lane is handsome, even if he is a wreck,\" said Elinor, with  sudden enthusiasm. \"Friday night when he beat it from Fanchon's party  he sure looked splendid.\"    Elinor was a staunch admirer of Lane's and she was the inveterate  torment of her girl friends. She gave Helen a sly glance. Helen's  green eyes narrowed and gleamed.    \"Yes, Dare's handsomer than ever,\" she said. \"And to give the devil  his due he's _finer_ than ever. Too damn fine for this crowd!... But  what's the use--\" she broke off.    \"Yes, poor Dare Lane!\" sighed Elinor. \"Dare deserves much from all of  us, not to mention _you_. He has made me think. Thank Heaven, I found  I hadn't forgotten how.\"    \"El, no one would notice it,\" returned Helen, sarcastically.    \"It's easy to see where you get off,\" retorted Elinor.    Then a silence ensued, strange in view of the late banter and quick  sallies; a silence breathing of restraint. The color died wholly from  Margaret's face, and a subtle, indefinable, almost imperceptible  change came over Dorothy.    \"You bet Dare is handsome,\" spoke up Flossie, as if to break the  embarrassment. \"He's so _white_ since he came home. His eyes are so  dark and flashing. Then the way he holds his head--the look of him....  No wonder these damned slackers seem cheap compared to him.... I'd  fall for Dare Lane in a minute, even if he is half dead.\"    The restraint passed, and when Floss Dickerson came out with eulogy  for any man his status was settled for good and all.

Of  the other ports in this country none is of greater note than that of St.  Paul's where they gather much gold; but the inhabitants are said to be a  sort of banditti, or loose people that live under no government: but  their gold brings them all sorts of commodities that they need, as  clothes, arms, ammunition, etc. The town is said to be large and strong.      CHAPTER 3.    TWO OCEANS AND NEW HOLLAND.    THE AUTHOR'S STAY AND BUSINESS AT BAHIA: OF THE WINDS, AND SEASONS OF THE  YEAR THERE.    My stay here at Bahia was about a month; during which time the viceroy of  Goa came hither from thence in a great ship, said to be richly laden with  all sorts of India goods; but she did not break bulk here, being bound  home for Lisbon; only the viceroy intended to refresh his men (of whom he  had lost many, and most of the rest were very sickly, having been 4  months in their voyage hither) and so to take in water, and depart for  Europe in company with the other Portuguese ships thither bound; who had  orders to be ready to sail by the twentieth of May. He desired me to  carry a letter for him, directed to his successor the new viceroy of Goa;  which I did, sending it thither afterwards by Captain Hammond, whom I  found near the Cape of Good Hope. The refreshing my men and taking in  water was the main also of my business here; beside the having the better  opportunity to compose the disorders among my crew: which, as I have  before related, were grown to so great a height that they could not  without great difficulty be appeased: however, finding opportunity during  my stay in this place to allay in some measure the ferment that had been  raised among my men, I now set myself to provide for the carrying on of  my voyage with more heart than before, and put all hands to work, in  order to it, as fast as the backwardness of my men would permit; who  showed continually their unwillingness to proceed farther. Besides, their  heads were generally filled with strange notions of southerly winds that  were now setting in (and there had been already some flurries of them)  which, as they surmised, would hinder any farther attempts of going on to  the southward so long as they should last.    The winds begin to shift here in April and September, and the seasons of  the year (the dry and the wet) alter with them. In April the southerly  winds make their entrance on this coast, bringing in the wet season, with  violent tornados, thunder and lightning, and much rain. In September the  other coasting trade at east-north-east comes in and clears the sky,  bringing fair weather. This, as to the change of wind, is what I have  observed, but as to the change of weather accompanying it so exactly here  at Bahia this is a particular exception to what I have experienced in all  other places of south latitudes that I have been in between the tropics,  or those I have heard of; for there the dry season sets in, in April, and  the wet about October or November, sooner or later (as I have said that  they are, in south latitudes, the reverse of the seasons, or weather, in  the same months in north latitudes, whereas on this coast of Brazil the  wet season comes in in April at the same time that it doth in north  latitudes, and the dry (as I have said here) in September; the rains here  not lasting so far in the year as in other places; for in September the  weather is usually so fair that in the latter part of that month they  begin to cut their sugarcane here, as I was told; for I enquired  particularly about the seasons: though this, as to the season of cutting  of cane, which I was now assured to be in September, agrees not very well  with that I was formerly told, that in Brazil they cut the cane in July.  And so as to what is said a little lower in the same page, that in  managing their cane they are not confined to the seasons, this ought to  have been expressed only of planting them; for they never cut them but in  the dry season.    But to return to the southerly winds, which came in (as I expected they  would) while I was here: these daunted my ship's company very much,  though I had told them they were to look for them: but they being  ignorant as to what I told them farther, that these were only coasting  winds, sweeping the shore to about 40 or 50 leagues in breadth from it,  and imagining that they had blown so all the sea over, between America  and Africa; and being confirmed in this their opinion by the Portuguese  pilots of European ships, with whom several of my officers conversed  much, and who were themselves as ignorant that these were only coasting  tradewinds (themselves going away before them in their return homewards  till they cross the Line, and so having no experience of the breadth of  them) being thus possessed with a conceit that we could not sail from  hence till September; this made them still the more remiss in their  duties, and very listless to the getting things in a readiness for our  departure. However I was the more diligent myself to have the ship  scrubbed, and to send my water casks ashore to get them trimmed, my beer  being now out. I went also to the governor to get my water filled; for  here being but one watering-place (and the water running low, now at the  end of the dry season) it was always so crowded with the European ships'  boats, who were preparing to be gone, that my men could seldom come nigh  it till the governor very kindly sent an officer to clear the  watering-place for my men, and to stay there till my water-casks were all  full, whom I satisfied for his pains. Here I also got aboard 9 or 10 ton  of ballast, and made my boatswain fit the rigging that was amiss: and I  enquired also of my particular officers, whose business it was, whether  they wanted any stores, especially pitch and tar; for that here I would  supply myself before I proceeded any farther; but they said they had  enough, though it did not afterwards prove so.    I commonly went ashore every day, either upon business, or to recreate  myself in the fields, which were very pleasant, and the more for a shower  of rain now and then, that ushers in the wet season. Several sorts of  good fruits were also still remaining, especially oranges, which were in  such plenty that I and all my company stocked ourselves for our voyage  with them, and they did us a great kindness; and we took in also a good  quantity of rum and sugar: but for fowls, they being here lean and dear,  I was glad I had stocked myself at St. Jago. But, by the little care my  officers took for fresh provisions, one might conclude they did not think  of going much farther. Besides I had like to have been embroiled with the  clergy here (of the Inquisition, as I suppose) and so my voyage might  have been hindered. What was said to them of me by some of my company  that went ashore I know not; but I was assured by a merchant there that  if they got me into their clutches (and it seems when I was last ashore  they had narrowly watched me) the governor himself could not release me.  Besides I might either be murdered in the streets, as he sent me word, or  poisoned, if I came ashore any more; and therefore he advised me to stay  aboard. Indeed I had now no further business ashore but to take leave of  the governor and therefore took his advice.    HIS DEPARTURE FOR NEW HOLLAND.    Our stay here was till the 23rd of April. I would have gone before if I  could sooner have fitted myself; but was now earnest to be gone, because  this harbour lies open to the south and south-south-west, which are  raging winds here, and now was the season for them. We had 2 or 3 touches  of them; and one pretty severe, and the ships ride there so near each  other that, if a cable would fail or an anchor start, you are instantly  aboard of one ship or other: and I was more afraid of being disabled he  in harbour by these blustering winds than discouraged by them, as my  people were, from prosecuting the voyage; for at present I even wished  for a brisk southerly wind, as soon as I should be once well out of the  harbour, to set me the sooner into the true general tradewind.    The tide of flood being spent, and having a fine land-breeze on the 23rd  in the morning, I went away from the anchoring place before it was light;  and then lay by till daylight that we might see the better how to go out  of the harbour. I had a pilot belonging to Mr. Cock who went out with me,  to whom I gave 3 dollars; but I found I could as well have gone out  myself by the soundings I made at coming in. The wind was east by north  and fair weather. By 10 o'clock I was got past all danger and then sent  away my pilot.    CAPE SALVADOR.    At 12 Cape Salvador bore north distant 6 leagues, and we had the winds  between the east by north and south-east a considerable time, so that we  kept along near the shore, commonly in sight of it. The southerly blasts  had now left us again; for they come at first in short flurries, and  shift to other points (for 10 or 12 days sometimes) before they are quite  set in: and we had uncertain winds, between sea and land-breezes, and the  coasting trade, which was itself unsettled.    THE WINDS ON THE BRAZILIAN COAST; AND ABROLHO SHOAL; FISH AND BIRDS: THE  SHEARWATER BIRD, AND COOKING OF SHARKS.    The easterly winds at present made me doubt I should not weather a great  shoal which lies in latitude between 18 and 19 degrees south, and runs a  great way into the sea, directly from the land, easterly. Indeed the  weather was fair (and continued so a good while) so that I might the  better avoid any danger from it: and if the wind came to the southward I  knew I could stretch off to sea; so that I jogged on"]]]
