The English, under Prince Rupert and Albemarle, were not long in  coming to the attack. The numbers of each fleet amounted to about eighty  sail; and the valor and experience of the commanders, as well as of the  seamen, rendered the engagement fierce and obstinate. Sir Thomas Allen,  who commanded the white squadron of the English, attacked the Dutch van,  which he entirely routed; and he killed the three admirals who commanded  it. Van Tromp engaged Sir Jeremy Smith; and during the heat of action,  he was separated from De Ruyter and the main body, whether by accident  or design was never certainly known. De Ruyter, with conduct and valor,  maintained the combat against the main body of the English; and,  though overpowered by numbers, kept his station, till night ended the  engagement. Next day, finding the Dutch fleet scattered and discouraged,  his high spirit submitted to a retreat, which yet he conducted with  such skill, as to render it equally honorable to himself as the greatest  victory. Full of indignation, however, at yielding the superiority to  the enemy, he frequently exclaimed, \"My God! what a wretch am I! Among  so many thousand bullets, is there not one to put an end to my miserable  life?\" One De Witte, his son-in-law, who stood near, exhorted him, since  he sought death, to turn upon the English, and render his life a dear  purchase to the victors. But De Ruyter esteemed it more worthy a brave  man to persevere to the uttermost, and, as long as possible, to render  service to his country. All that night and next day, the English pressed  upon the rear of the Dutch; and it was chiefly by the redoubled efforts  of De Ruyter, that the latter saved themselves in their harbors.    The loss sustained by the Hollanders in this action was not very  considerable; but as violent animosities had broken out  between the two admirals, who engaged all the officers on one side or  other, the consternation which took place was great among the provinces.  Tromp's commission was at last taken from him; but though several  captains had misbehaved, they were so effectually protected by their  friends in the magistracy of the towns, that most of them escaped  punishment, and many were still continued in their commands.    The English now rode incontestable masters of the sea, and insulted the  Dutch in their harbors. A detachment under Holmes was sent into the road  of Vlie, and burned a hundred and forty merchantmen, two men-of-war,  together with Brandaris, a large and rich village on the coast. The  Dutch merchants, who lost by this enterprise, uniting themselves to  the Orange faction, exclaimed against an administration which, they  pretended, had brought such disgrace and ruin on their country. None but  the firm and intrepid mind of De Wit could have supported itself under  such a complication of calamities.    The king of France, apprehensive that the Dutch would sink under their  misfortunes, at least that De Wit, his friend, might be dispossessed of  the administration, hastened the advance of the duke of Beaufort. The  Dutch fleet likewise was again equipped; and under the command of  De Ruyter, cruised near the Straits of Dover. Prince Rupert with the  English navy, now stronger than ever, came full sail upon them. The  Dutch admiral thought proper to decline the combat, and retired into St.  John's road, near Bulloigne. Here he sheltered himself, both from the  English, and from a furious storm which arose. Prince Rupert, too, was  obliged to retire into St. Helens; where he staid some time, in order  to repair the damages which he had sustained. Meanwhile the duke  of Beaufort proceeded up the Channel, and passed the English fleet  unperceived; but he did not find the Dutch, as he expected. De Ruyter  had been seized with a fever: many of the chief officers had fallen into  sickness: a contagious distemper was spread through the fleet: and the  states thought it necessary to recall them into their harbors, before  the enemy should be refitted. The French king, anxious for his navy,  which with so much care and industry he had so lately built, despatched  orders to Beaufort, to make the best of his way to Brest. That admiral  had again the good fortune to pass the English. One ship alone, the  Ruby, fell into the hands of the enemy.    While the war continued without any decisive success on either side,  a calamity happened in London which threw the people into great  consternation. Fire, breaking out in a baker's house near the bridge,  spread itself on all sides with such rapidity, that no efforts could  extinguish it, till it laid in ashes a considerable part of the city.  The inhabitants, without being able to provide effectually for their  relief, were reduced to be spectators of their own ruin; and were  pursued from street to street by the flames, which unexpectedly gathered  round them. Three days and nights did the fire advance; and it was only  by the blowing up of houses that it was at last extinguished. The king  and duke used their utmost endeavors to stop the progress of the flames;  but all their industry was unsuccessful. About four hundred streets and  thirteen thousand houses were reduced to ashes.    The causes of this calamity were evident. The narrow streets of London,  the houses built entirely of wood, the dry season, and a violent east  wind which blew; these were so many concurring circumstances, which  rendered it easy to assign the reason of the destruction that ensued.  But the people were not satisfied with this obvious account. Prompted  by blind rage, some ascribed the guilt to the republicans, others to the  Catholics; though it is not easy to conceive how the burning of London  could serve the purposes of either party. As the Papists were the chief  objects of public detestation, the rumor which threw the guilt on them  was more favorably received by the people. No proof, however, or even  presumption, after the strictest inquiry by a committee of parliament,  ever appeared to authorize such a calumny; yet, in order to give  countenance to the popular prejudice, the inscription, engraved by  authority on the monument, ascribed this calamity to that hated sect.  This clause was erased by order of King James, when he came to the  throne; but after the revolution it was replaced: so credulous, as well  as obstinate, are the people in believing every thing which flatters  their prevailing passion.    The fire of London, though at that time a great calamity, has proved  in the issue beneficial both to the city and the kingdom. The city was  rebuilt in a very little time; and care was taken to make the streets  wider and more regular than before. A discretionary power was assumed  by the king to regulate the distribution of the buildings, and to forbid  the use of lath and timber, the materials of which the houses were  formerly composed. The necessity was so urgent, and the occasion so  extraordinary that no exceptions were taken at an exercise of authority  which otherwise might have been deemed illegal. Had the king been  enabled to carry his power still further, and made the houses be  rebuilt with perfect regularity, and entirely upon one plan, he had much  contributed to the convenience, as well as embellishment of the city.  Great advantages, however, have resulted from the alterations though not  carried to the full length. London became much more healthy after the  fire. The plague, which used to break out with great fury twice or  thrice every century, and indeed was always lurking in some corner or  other of the city, has scarcely ever appeared since that calamity.    The parliament met soon after, and gave the sanction of law to those  regulations made by royal authority; as well as appointed commissioners  for deciding all such questions of property as might arise from the  fire. They likewise voted a supply of one million eight hundred thousand  pounds, to be levied, partly by a poll-bill, partly by assessments.  Though their inquiry brought out no proofs which could fix on the  Papists the burning of London, the general aversion against that  sect still prevailed; and complaints were made, probably without much  foundation, of its dangerous increase. Charles, at the desire of the  commons, issued a proclamation for the banishment of all priests and  Jesuits; but the bad execution of this, as well as of former edicts,  destroyed all confidence in his sincerity, whenever he pretended an  aversion towards the Catholic religion. Whether suspicions of this  nature had diminished the king's popularity, is uncertain; but it  appears that the supply was voted much later than Charles expected, or  even than the public necessities seemed to require. The intrigues of  the duke of Buckingham, a man who wanted only steadiness to render him  extremely dangerous, had somewhat embarrassed the measures of the court:  and this was the first time that the king found any considerable reason  to complain of a failure of confidence in this house of commons. The  rising symptoms of ill humor tended, no doubt, to quicken the steps  which were already making towards a peace with foreign enemies.    Charles began to be sensible, that all the ends for which the war had  been undertaken were likely to prove entirely abortive. The Dutch, even  when single, had defended themselves with vigor, and were every day  improving in their military skill and preparations.    {1667.} Though their trade had suffered extremely, their extensive  credit enabled them to levy great sums; and while the seamen of England  loudly complained of want of pay, the Dutch navy was regularly supplied  with money and every thing requisite for its subsistence. As two  powerful kings now supported them, every place, from the extremity of  Norway to the coasts of Bayonne, was become hostile to the English. And  Charles, neither"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19217"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.II. (#13)"],[1,"erswaert, undertook the siege of Bonne, which the garrison  surrendered after having made a long and vigorous defence. Nothing  contributed more to the union of the German princes than their  resentment of the shocking barbarity with which the French had  plundered, wasted, and depopulated their country. Louis having, by his  intrigues in Poland and at Constantinople, prevented a pacification  between the emperor and the Ottoman Porte, the campaign was opened in  Croatia, where five thousand Turks were defeated by a body of Croates  between Vihitz and Novi. The prince of Baden, who commanded the  imperialists on that side, having thrown a bridge over the Morava at  Passarowitz, crossed that river, and marched in quest of a Turkish  army amounting to fifty thousand men, headed by a seraskier. On the  thirteenth day of August he attacked the enemy in their intrenchments  near Patochin, and forced their lines, routed them with great slaughter,  and took possession of their camp, baggage, and artillery. They returned  to Nissa, where the general finding them still more numerous than the  imperialists, resolved to make a stand, and encamped in a situation that  was inaccessible in every part except the rear, which he left open  for the convenience of a retreat. Through this avenue he was, on the  twenty-fourth day of September, attacked by the prince of Baden,  who, after a desperate resistance, obtained another complete victory,  enriched his troops with the spoil of the enemy, and entered Nissa  without opposition. There he found above three thousand horses and a  vast quantity of provisions. Having reposed his army for a few days in  this place, he resumed his march against the Turks, who had chosen  an advantageous post at Widen, and seemed ambitious of retrieving the  honour they had lost in the two former engagements. The Germans attacked  their lines without hesitation; and though the Musselmen fought with  incredible fury, they were a third time defeated with great slaughter.  This defeat was attended with the loss of Widen, which being surrendered  to the victor, he distributed his troops in winter quarters, and  returned to Vienna covered with laurels.          DEATH OF POPE INNOCENT XI.    The French were likewise baffled in their attempt upon Catalonia, where  the duke de Noailles had taken Campredon in the month of May. Leaving a  garrison in this place, he retreated to the frontiers of France, while  the duke de Villa Hermosa, at the head of a Spanish army, blocked up the  place and laid Rousillon under contribution. He afterwards undertook the  siege in form, and Noailles marched to its relief; but he was so hard  pressed by the Spaniards that he withdrew the garrison, dismantled the  place, and retreated with great precipitation. The French king hoped to  derive some considerable advantage from the death of Pope Innocent XL  which happened on the twelfth day of August. That pontiff had been an  inveterate enemy to Louis ever since the affair of the franchises, and  the seizure of Avignon. [016] _[See note F, at the end of this Vol.]_  Cabals were immediately formed at Eome by the French faction against  the Spanish and Imperial interest. The French cardinals, de Bouillon and  Bonzi, accompanied by Furstemberg, repaired to Eome with a large sum  of money. Peter Ottoboni, a Venetian, was elected pope, and assumed the  name of Alexander VIII. The duke de Chaulnes, ambassador from France,  immediately signified in the name of his master, that Avignon should  be restored to the patrimony of the church; and Louis renounced the  franchises in a letter written by his own hand to the pontiff. Alexander  received these marks of respect with the warmest acknowledgments; but  when the ambassador and Furstemberg besought him to re-examine the  election of the bishop of Cologne, which had been the source of so much  calamity to the empire, he lent a deaf ear to their solicitations.  He even confirmed the dispensations granted by his predecessor to the  prince of Bavaria, who was thus empowered to take possession of the  electorate, though he had not yet attained the age required by the  canons. Furstemberg retired in disgust to Paris, where Louis immediately  gratified him with the abbey of St. Germains.    {WILLIAM AND MARY, 1688--1701.}          KING WILLIAM BECOMES UNPOPULAR.    King William found it an easier task to unite the councils of Europe  against the common enemy than to conciliate and preserve the affections  of his own subjects, among whom he began visibly to decline in point of  popularity. Many were dissatisfied with his measures; and a great number  even of those who exerted themselves for his elevation had conceived a  disgust from his personal deportment, which was very unsuitable to the  manners and disposition of the English people. Instead of mingling  with his nobility in social amusements and familiar conversation, he  maintained a disagreeable reserve which had all the air of sullen pride;  he seldom or never spoke to his courtiers or attendants, he spent his  time chiefly in the closet retired from all communication; or among  his troops in a camp he had formed at Hounslow; or in the exercise of  hunting, to which he was immoderately addicted. This had been prescribed  to him by physicians as necessary to improve his constitution, which was  naturally weak, and by practice had become so habitual that he could not  lay it aside. His ill health co-operating with his natural aversion  to society, produced a peevishness which could not fail of being  displeasing to those who were near his person: this was increased by the  disputes in his cabinet, and the opposition of those who were professed  enemies to his government, as well as by the alienation of his former  friends. As he could not breathe without difficulty in the air of  London, he resided chiefly at Hampton-court, and expended considerable  sums in beautifying and enlarging that palace; he likewise purchased the  house at Kensington of the earl of Nottingham; and such profusion in the  beginning of an expensive war gave umbrage to the nation in general.  Whether he was advised by his counsellors, or his own sagacity pointed  out the expediency of conforming with the English humour, he now seemed  to change his disposition, and in some measure adopt the manners of his  predecessors. In imitation of Charles II. he resorted to the races at  Newmarket; he accepted an invitation to visit Cambridge, where he  behaved himself with remarkable affability to the members of the  university; he afterwards dined with the lord-mayor of London, accepted  the freedom of the city, and condescended so far as to become  sovereign-master of the company of grocers.          A GOOD NUMBER OF THE CLERGY REFUSE TO TAKE THE OATHS.    While William thus endeavoured to remove the prejudices which had been  conceived against his person, the period arrived which the parliament  had prescribed for taking the oaths to the new government. Some  individuals of the clergy sacrificed their benefices to their scruples  of conscience, and absolutely refused to take oaths that were contrary  to those they had already sworn in favour of their late sovereign. These  were distinguished by the epithet of nonjurors: but their number bore  a very small proportion to that of others, who took them with such  reservations and distinctions as redounded very little to the honour of  their integrity. Many of those who had been the warmest advocates for  non-resistance and passive obedience, made no scruple of renouncing  their allegiance to king James, and complying with the present act,  after having declared that they took the oaths in no other sense than  that of a peaceable submission to the powers that were. They even  affirmed that the legislature itself had allowed the distinction between  a king _de facto_ and a king _de jure_, as they had dropped the word  \"rightful\" when the form was under debate. They alleged that as prudence  obliged them to conform to the letter of the oath, so conscience  required them to give it their own interpretation. Nothing could be more  infamous and of worse tendency than this practice of equivocating in  the most sacred of all obligations. It introduced a general disregard of  oaths, which hath been the source of universal perjury and corruption.  Though this set of temporizers were bitterly upbraided both by the  nonjurors and the papists, they all concurred in representing William as  an enemy to the church; as a prince educated in the doctrines of Calvin,  which he plainly espoused, by limiting his favour and preferment to such  as were latitudinarians in religion, and by his abolishing episcopacy  in Scotland. The presbyterians in that kingdom now tyrannized in their  turn. They were headed by the earl of Crawford, a nobleman of a violent  temper and strong prejudices. He was chosen president of the parliament  by the interest of Melvil, and oppressed the episcopalians in such a  manner that the greater part of them from resentment became well-wishers  to king James. Every circumstance of the hardships they underwent was  reported in England; and the earl of Clarendon, as well as the suspended  bishops, circulated these particulars with great assiduity. The oaths  being rejected by the archbishop of Canterbury, the bishops of Ely,  Chichester, Bath and Wells, Peterborough and Gloucester, they were  suspended from their functions, and threatened with deprivation. Lake  of Chichester, being seized with a dangerous distemper, signed a solemn  declaration, in which he professed his adherence to the doctrine of  non-resistance and passive obedience, which he believed to be the  distinguishing characteristic of the church of England. After his death  this paper was published, industriously circulated, and extolled by the  party as an inspired oracle pronounced by a martyr to religious truth  and sincerity.
