In a small  way it was an illuminating glimpse of how the personality of a true  artist can metamorphose what at first glance might seem something quite  negligible, and create beauty where its possibilities alone had existed  before.    It is this personal, this individual, note in all that Fritz Kreisler  does--when he plays, when he composes, when he transcribes--that gives  his art-effort so great and unique a quality of appeal.    Talking to him in his comfortable sitting-room in the Hotel  Wellington--Homer and Juvenal (in the original) ranked on the piano-top  beside De Vere Stackpole novels and other contemporary literature called  to mind that though Brahms and Beethoven violin concertos are among his  favorites, he does not disdain to play a Granados _Spanish Dance_--it  seemed natural to ask him how he came to make those adaptations and  transcripts which have been so notable a feature of his programs, and  which have given such pleasure to thousands.               [Illustration: FRITZ KREISLER, with hand-written note]                      HOW KREISLER CAME TO COMPOSE AND ARRANGE    He said: \"I began to compose and arrange as a young man. I wanted to  create a repertory for myself, to be able to express through my medium,  the violin, a great deal of beautiful music that had first to be adapted  for the instrument. What I composed and arranged was for my own use,  reflected my own musical tastes and preferences. In fact, it was not  till years after that I even thought of publishing the pieces I had  composed and arranged. For I was very diffident as to the outcome of  such a step. I have never written anything with the commercial idea of  making it 'playable.' And I have always felt that anything done in a  cold-blooded way for purely mercenary considerations somehow cannot be  good. It cannot represent an artist's best.\"                             AT THE VIENNA CONSERVATORY    In reply to another query Mr. Kreisler reverted to the days when as a  boy he studied at the Vienna Conservatory. \"I was only seven when I  attended the Conservatory and was much more interested in playing in the  park, where my boy friends would be waiting for me, than in taking  lessons on the violin. And yet some of the most lasting musical  impressions of my life were gathered there. Not so much as regards study  itself, as with respect to the good music I heard. Some very great men  played at the Conservatory when I was a pupil. There were Joachim,  Sarasate in his prime, Hellmesberger, and Rubinstein, whom I heard play  the first time he came to Vienna. I really believe that hearing Joachim  and Rubinstein play was a greater event in my life and did more for me  than five years of study!\"    \"Of course you do not regard technic as the main essential of the  concert violinist's equipment?\" I asked him. \"Decidedly not. Sincerity  and personality are the first main essentials. Technical equipment is  something which should be taken for granted. The _virtuoso_ of the type  of Ole Bull, let us say, has disappeared. The 'stunt' player of a former  day with a repertory of three or four bravura pieces was not far above  the average music-hall 'artist.' The modern _virtuoso_, the true concert  artist, is not worthy of the title unless his art is the outcome of a  completely unified nature.                                  VIOLIN MASTERY    \"I do not believe that any artist is truly a master of his instrument  unless his control of it is an integral part of a whole. The musician is  born--his medium of expression is often a matter of accident. I believe  one may be intended for an artist prenatally; but whether violinist,  'cellist or pianist is partly a matter of circumstance. Violin mastery,  to my mind, still falls short of perfection, in spite of the completest  technical and musical equipment, if the artist thinks only of the  instrument he plays. After all, it is just a single medium of  expression. The true musician is an artist with a special instrument.  And every real artist has the feeling for other forms and mediums of  expression if he is truly a master of his own.                             TECHNIC VERSUS IMAGINATION    \"I think the technical element in the artist's education is often unduly  stressed. Remember,\" added Mr. Kreisler, with a smile, \"I am not a  teacher, and this is a purely personal opinion I am giving you. But it  seems to me that absolute sincerity of effort, actual impossibility  _not_ to react to a genuine musical impulse are of great importance. I  firmly believe that if one is destined to become an artist the technical  means find themselves. The necessity of expression will follow the line  of least resistance. Too great a manual equipment often leads to an  exaggeration of the technical and tempts the artist to stress it unduly.    \"I have worked a great deal in my life, but have always found that too  large an amount of purely technico-musical work fatigued me and reacted  unfavorably on my imagination. As a rule I only practice enough to keep  my fingers in trim; the nervous strain is such that doing more is out of  the question. And for a concert-violinist when on tour, playing every  day, the technical question is not absorbing. Far more important is it  for him to keep himself mentally and physically fresh and in the right  mood for his work. For myself I have to enjoy whatever I play or I  cannot play it. And it has often done me more good to dip my finger-tips  in hot water for a few seconds before stepping out on the platform than  to spend a couple of hours practicing. But I should not wish the student  to draw any deductions from what I say on this head. It is purely  personal and has no general application.    \"Technical exercises I use very moderately. I wish my imagination to be  responsive, my interest fresh, and as a rule I have found that too much  work along routine channels does not accord with the best development of  my Art. I feel that technic should be in the player's head, it should be  a mental picture, a sort of 'master record.' It should be a matter of  will power to which the manual possibilities should be subjected.  Technic to me is a mental and not a manual thing.                  MENTAL TECHNIC: ITS DRAWBACK AND ITS ADVANTAGE    \"The technic thus achieved, a technic whose controlling power is chiefly  mental, is not perfect--I say so frankly--because it is more or less  dependent on the state of the artist's nervous system. Yet it is the one  and only kind of technic that can adequately and completely express the  musician's every instinct, wish and emotion. Every other form of technic  is stiff, unpliable, since it cannot entirely subordinate itself to the  individuality of the artist.\"                      PRACTICE HOURS FOR THE ADVANCED STUDENT    Mr. Kreisler gives no lessons and hence referred this question in the  most amiable manner to his boyhood friend and fellow-student Felix  Winternitz, the well-known Boston violin teacher, one of the faculty of  the New England Conservatory of Music, who had come in while we were  talking. Mr. Winternitz did not refuse an answer: \"The serious student,  in my opinion, should not practice less than four hours a day, nor need  he practice more than five. Other teachers may demand more. Sevcik, I  know, insists that his pupils practice eight and ten hours a day. To do  so one must have the constitution of an ox, and the results are often  not equal to those produced by four hours of concentrated work. As Mr.  Kreisler intimated with regard to technic, practice calls for brain  power. Concentration in itself is not enough. There is only one way to  work and if the pupil can find it he can cover the labor of weeks in an  hour.\"    And turning to me, Mr. Winternitz added: \"You must not take Mr. Kreisler  too seriously when he lays no stress on his own practicing. During the  concert season he has his violin in hand for an hour or so nearly every  day. He does not call it practicing, and you and I would consider it  playing and great playing at that. But it is a genuine illustration of  what I meant when I said that one who knew how could cover the work of  weeks in an hour's time.\"                          AN EXPLANATION BY MR. WINTERNITZ    I tried to draw from the famous violinist some hint as to the secret of  the abiding popularity of his own compositions and transcripts but--as  those who know him are aware--Kreisler has all the modesty of the truly  great. He merely smiled and said: \"Frankly, I don't know.\" But Mr.  Winternitz' comment (when a 'phone call had taken Kreisler from the room  for a moment) was, \"It is the touch given by his accompaniments that  adds so much: a harmonic treatment so rich in design and coloring, and  so varied that melodies were never more beautifully set off.\" Mr.  Kreisler, as he came in again, remarked: \"I don't mind telling you that  I enjoyed very much writing my _Tambourin Chinois_.[A] The idea for it  came to me after a visit to the Chinese theater in San Francisco--not  that the music there suggested any theme, but it gave me the impulse to  write a free fantasy in the Chinese manner.\"    [Footnote A: It is interesting to note that Nikolai Sokoloff, conductor  of the San Francisco Philharmonic, returning from a tour of the American  and French army camps in France, some time ago, said: \"My most popular  number was Kreisler's _Tambourin Chinois_. Invariably I had to repeat  that.\" A strong indorsement of the internationalism of Art by the actual  fighter in the trenches.]                    STYLE, INTERPRETATION AND THE ARTISTIC IDEAL    The question of style now came up. \"I am not in favor of 'labeling' the  concert artist, of calling him a 'lyric' or a 'dramatic' or some other  kind of a player. If he is an artist in the real sense he controls all  styles.\" Then, in answer to another question: \"Nothing can express music  but music itself."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15540"],[0,"Across India; Or, Live Boys in the Far East (#13)"],[1," the great nations of the world.    \"But I am wandering from my subject. India is about 1,900 miles in extent  from north to south, and 1,600 in breadth in latitude 25 deg. north. The  boundaries of this vast country, established by nature for the most part,  are the Bay of Bengal (now called a sea in the southern portion) on the  south-east, and the Arabian Sea on the south-west. On the north the  Himalaya Mountains separate it from China, Thibet, and Turkestan; but some  of these countries are called by various names, as Chinese Tartary,  Mongolia, Eastern Turkestan, and so on. On the west are Beloochistan and  Afghanistan, and on the east Siam and China, though the boundaries were  somewhat disturbed last summer in the former.\"    \"We used to pronounce the name of your great northern range of mountains  Hi-ma-lay'-a; you do not call it so, Sir Modava,\" said the commander.    \"I have always called it Hi-mal'-a-ya, the _a_ after the accented  syllable being very slightly sounded; this is the pronunciation of all the  Indian officials,\" replied the speaker, with his pleasant smile. \"These  mountains consist of a number of ranges; they extend 1,500 miles east and  west, and are the sources of the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra. The  highest is Mount Everest, the loftiest mountain in the world, 29,002 feet;  and I could mention several other peaks which overtop any of the Andes.  Himalaya means 'the abode of snow,' and the foot-hills are the resorts of  the wealthy to obtain a cool climate in the summer.    \"India is remarkable for its fertility, and its luxuriant growth of plants  of all sorts, from the productions of the torrid zone to those of the  temperate in the hilly regions of the north. It is abundantly watered by  the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Jumna, the Indus, the Godavari, and other  great streams. The Ganges, though it does not vie with the great rivers of  America, is 1,557 miles in length. To the natives it is a sacred river, and  the land through which it flows is holy ground. To bathe in its waters  washes away sin; to die and be buried on its shores procures a free  admission to the eternal paradise of heaven.    \"The Ganges Canal, constructed in 1854, is 445 miles long, and is used for  both navigation and irrigation. Doubtless you will sail upon it, and learn  more about it. Near the Indus are two deserts, one 500 miles long, and the  other 400, though the grains may be cultivated in the valleys and other low  places; and perhaps these regions will be reclaimed by artificial  irrigation. In ancient times gold-mines were worked in the south-west, and  the currency consisted of this metal instead of silver, as at the present  time; but the veins were exhausted, and the Mysore mines are all that is  left of them.    \"I suppose you Americans have been accustomed to regard India as an  exceedingly hot country; and this is quite true of a considerable portion  of it. In a region extending from the almost tropical island of Ceylon,  nearly 2,000 miles to the snow-capped summits of the highest mountains in  the world, there must necessarily be a great variety of climate. India has  three well-defined seasons,--the cool, the hot, and the rainy. The cool  months are November, December, January, and a part of February.    \"The rainy season comes in the middle of the summer, earlier or later, and  ends in September. Winter is the pleasantest season of the year; but  autumn, unlike England, is hot, moist, and unhealthy. Monsoon comes from an  Arabian or Persian word, meaning a season; and you have learned something  about it by this time. It is applied to the south-west winds of the Indian  Ocean, changing to the north or north-east in the winter. This wind  produces rain, and when they infrequently fail, portions of the country are  subjected to famines.    \"At an elevation of 7,200 feet the temperature is an average of 58 deg.  Fahrenheit, as I shall give all readings of the thermometer. At Madras, on  the south-east coast, it is 83 deg.; at Bombay, 84 deg.; Calcutta, 79 deg.; and in  Delhi, in latitude 29 deg. (about the same as the northern part of Florida), it  is 72 deg.. These annual average temperatures will not seem high to you; but I  beg you not to form a wrong impression, for the heat of summer is generally  oppressive, and the average temperature is considerably reduced by the  coolness of the winter months. In Delhi, quoted at 72 deg., the glass often  indicates over 100 deg..    \"The rain varies greatly in different regions. In the north-east it exceeds  75 inches, and in one remarkable year 600 inches fell at an observatory in  north-east Bengal. In some of the western parts it is only 30 inches, while  it is hardly 15 on the southern shores of the Indus. I think I must have  sufficiently wearied you, ladies and gentlemen.\"    \"No! No! No!\" almost shouted the company with one voice; and perhaps there  was something so fascinating in the manner of the distinguished Hindu which  exorcised all weariness from their minds and bodies.    \"Thank you with all my heart; but really you must permit me to retire, for  I am somewhat fatigued, if you are not, and I shall be happy to contribute  to your entertainment at another time,\" replied the speaker; and he retired  from the platform.    \"I shall next call upon Mr. Woolridge, who will speak to you of the fauna  of India,\" said the commander.    The magnate of the Fifth Avenue, not much accustomed to speaking in public,  was somewhat diffident about addressing the company in the presence of  those who were so well versed in Indian lore; but he conquered his modesty,  and took his place on the stand. In expressing his appreciation of the last  speaker, he mentioned that he occupied a difficult position in the presence  of those who knew India as they knew their alphabet, and begged them to  consider his talk as addressed only to the Americans of the party. The  guests declared that they should be very glad to hear him; and he bowed,  smiled, and proceeded with his remarks:--    \"Fortunately I have not much to say, for it will consist mainly of the  mention of the names of the principal animals in the fauna of India,\" he  began.    \"Are all the animals fawns?\" asked Mrs. Blossom, who evidently mistook the  meaning of the term used.    \"No, madam; some of them are snakes. But I shall refer the serpents to Sir  Modava; for I am very anxious to hear the views of a native on that  subject. The cattle are cows, buffaloes, and oxen, the two latter used as  draft animals, and as agricultural workers. Bulls and cows are sacred  beasts, and the Hindus never kill them for food.\"    \"Except Christianized natives, like myself,\" interpolated Sir Modava.    \"Thank you. The native breeds of horses have been greatly improved under  the direction of the horse-fancying Briton; but they are never used on the  farm. Ponies, donkeys, and mules are in use for various purposes. There are  plenty of sheep and goats--so there are of hogs; but the higher of the  middle class, like the Jews, regard them as unclean beasts, and would as  soon take poison as eat the flesh of a pig. I don't sympathize with them,  for I like roast pork when it is well brought up and kept clean.    \"Monkeys are as tame as they are mischievous; and doubtless they are tame  because they are held to be sacred, and have a better time than they do in  Africa and elsewhere. But all the fun of the fauna is concentrated in the  wild animals, such as the tiger (about the gamiest 'critter' that exists),  the panther, cheetah, boar, bear, elephant, and rhinoceros. Two kinds of  crocodiles (not alligators) live in the mud and water of the rivers; and I  suppose they snap up a man or woman when they get a chance, as they do in  the Philippine Islands and other countries. I advise you all to give them a  wide berth; for their bite is worse than their bark, like that of some men  we know of.    \"There are plenty of deer to furnish a dainty and healthy diet for the  meat-eating wild animals, including the lion, which is not much of a king  of beasts here, the hyena, the lynx, and the wolf. All of these last take a  back seat compared with the tiger. Game and other birds would make a  hunter's paradise if it were not for the snakes and tigers, which are  unpleasant to an American when his piece is loaded with only birdshot.    \"In the towns on the sea the fish are excellent, and an important industry  is curing and smoking them for the markets. In the mountain streams the  fishing is very good; but in the warm waters of the streams on the plains,  as in Egypt, the fish are soft, and neither palatable nor healthy. Leaving  the snakes to the tender mercies of the gentleman from Travancore, I will  make my bow,\" which he did, and stepped down.    He was politely applauded, and the strangers seemed to enjoy his discourse  more than the rest of the party.                                           CHAPTER X                        THE FLORA AND THE SNAKES OF INDIA      The middle of the day was devoted to recreation. It was a very pleasant day  after the storm, and the ship had again struck into the north-east monsoon.  While most of the company were planking the promenade deck, it was observed  that Lord Tremlyn and Dr. Ferrolan had retired to the library; for though  they were very familiar with India and its people, they desired to freshen  their memory among the books.    Miss Blanche was walking the deck with Louis on one side of her, and Sir  Modava on the other. All the ladies had declared over and over again that  the latter was a very fascinating man; but he was a person of discernment,  and he could not very well help seeing that the young millionaire had a  special interest in the beautiful young lady.    Like a small boy, the young couple ate sugar because they liked it, and not  to swell the saccharine importance of the article, and probably never gave  a thought to the natural results of their daily"]]]
