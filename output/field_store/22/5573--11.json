The deepest tissues      were cut, the tendons were stretched, the incision was sewed up, all      apparently without the patient's knowledge.    Some types of articles, although expository in purpose, are entirely  narrative and descriptive in form. By relating his own experiences in a  confession story, for example, a writer may be able to show very clearly  and interestingly the dangers of speculations in stocks with but small  capital. Personality sketches are almost always narrative and  descriptive.    Many of the devices of the short story will be found useful in articles.  Not only is truth stranger than fiction, but facts may be so presented  as to be even more interesting than fiction. Conversation,  character-drawing, suspense, and other methods familiar to the writer of  short stories may be used effectively in special articles. Their  application to particular types of articles is shown in the following  pages.    SPECIAL TYPES OF ARTICLES. Although there is no generally recognized  classification of special feature articles, several distinct types may  be noted, such as (1) the interview, (2) the personal experience story,  (3) the confession article, (4) the \"how-to-do-something\" article, (5)  the personality sketch, (6) the narrative in the third person. These  classes, it is evident, are not mutually exclusive, but may for  convenience be treated separately.    THE INTERVIEW. Since the material for many articles is obtained by means  of an interview, it is often convenient to put the major part, if not  the whole, of the story in interview form. Such an article may consist  entirely of direct quotation with a limited amount of explanatory  material concerning the person interviewed; or it may be made up partly  of direct quotation and partly of indirect quotation, combined with the  necessary explanation. For greater variety it is advisable to alternate  direct and indirect quotations. A description of the person interviewed  and of his surroundings, by way of introduction, gives the reader a  distinct impression of the individual under characteristic conditions.  Or some striking utterance of his may be \"played up\" at the beginning,  to be followed by a picture of him and his surroundings. Interviews on  the same topic with two or more persons may be combined in a single  article.    The interview has several obvious advantages. First, the spoken word,  quoted _verbatim_, gives life to the story. The person interviewed seems  to be talking to each reader individually. The description of him in his  surroundings helps the reader to see him as he talks. Second, events,  explanations, and opinions given in the words of one who speaks with  authority, have greater weight than do the assertions of an unknown  writer. Third, the interview is equally effective whether the writer's  purpose is to inform, to entertain, or to furnish practical guidance.  Romance and adventure, humor and pathos, may well be handled in  interview form. Discoveries, inventions, new processes, unusual methods,  new projects, and marked success of any kind may be explained to  advantage in the words of those responsible for these undertakings.    In obtaining material for an interview story, a writer should bear in  mind a number of points regarding interviewing in general. First, in  advance of meeting the person to be interviewed, he should plan the  series of questions by which he hopes to elicit the desired information.  \"What would my readers ask this person if they had a chance to talk to  him about this subject?\" he must ask himself. That is, his questions  should be those that readers would like to have answered. Since it is  the answers, however, and not the questions, that will interest readers,  the questions in the completed article should be subordinated as much as  possible. Sometimes they may be skillfully embodied in the replies;  again they may be implied merely, or entirely omitted. In studying an  interview article, one can generally infer what questions the  interviewer used. Second, he must cultivate his memory so that he can  recall a person's exact words without taking notes. Most men talk more  freely and easily when they are not reminded of the fact that what they  are saying is to be printed. In interviewing, therefore, it is desirable  to keep pencil and paper out of sight. Third, immediately after leaving  the person whom he has interviewed, the writer should jot down facts,  figures, striking statements, and anything else that he might forget.    EXAMPLES OF THE INTERVIEW ARTICLE. As a timely special feature story for  Arbor Day, a Washington correspondent used the following interview with  an expert as a means of giving readers practical advice on  tree-planting:        ARBOR DAY ADVICE        WASHINGTON, April 1.--Three spadefuls of rich, pulverized earth will      do more to make a young tree grow than a 30-minute Arbor day address      by the president of the school board and a patriotic anthem by the      senior class, according to Dr. Furman L. Mulford, tree expert for      the department of agriculture.        Not that Dr. Mulford would abbreviate the ceremonies attendant upon      Arbor day planting, but he thinks that they do not mean much unless      the roots planted receive proper and constant care. For what the      Fourth of July is to the war and navy departments, and what Labor      day is to the department of labor, Arbor day is to the department of      agriculture.        While the forestry bureau has concerned itself primarily with trees      from the standpoint of the timber supply, Dr. Mulford has been      making a study of trees best adapted for streets and cities      generally. And nobody is more interested than he in what Arbor day      signifies or how trees should be chosen and reared.        \"We need trees most where our population is the thickest, and some      trees, like some people, are not adapted to such a life,\" said Dr.      Mulford. \"For street or school yard planting one of the first      considerations is a hardy tree, that can find nourishment under      brick pavements or granite sidewalks. It must be one that branches      high from the ground and ought to be native to the country and      climate. America has the prettiest native trees and shrubs in the      world and it is true patriotism to recognize them.        \"For Southern states one of the prettiest and best of shade trees is      the laurel oak, and there will be thousands of them planted this      spring. It is almost an evergreen and is a quick growing tree. The      willow oak is another.        \"A little farther north the red oak is one of the most desirable,      and in many places the swamp maple grows well, though this latter      tree does not thrive well in crowded cities.        \"Nothing, however, is prettier than the American elm when it reaches      the majesty of its maturity and I do not believe it will ever cease      to be a favorite. One thing against it, though, is the 'elm beetle,'      a pest which is spreading and which will kill some of our most      beautiful trees unless spraying is consistently practised. China      berry trees, abundant in the South, and box elders, native to a      score of states, are quick growing, but they reach maturity too soon      and begin to go to pieces.\"        \"What is the reason that so many Arbor day trees die?\" Dr. Mulford      was asked.        \"Usually lack of protection, and often lack of care in planting,\"      was the answer. \"When the new tree begins to put out tender rootlets      a child brushing against it or 'inspecting' it too closely will      break them off and it dies. Or stock will nip off the new leaves and      shoots and the result is the same. A frame around the tree would      prevent this.        \"Then, often wild trees are too big when transplanted. Such trees      have usually only a few long roots and so much of these are lost in      transplanting that the large trunk cannot be nourished by the      remainder. With nursery trees the larger they are the better it is,      for they have a lot of small roots that do not have to be cut off.        \"Fruit trees are seldom so successful as shade trees, either along      a street or road or in a yard. In the first place their branches are      too low and unless carefully pruned their shape is irregular. Then      they are subject to so many pests that unless constant care is given      them they will not bear a hatful of fruit a season.        \"On the other hand, nut trees are usually hardy and add much to the      landscape. Pecan, chestnut, walnut and shaggy bark hickory are some      of the more popular varieties.\"        The first Arbor day was observed in Nebraska, which has fewer      natural trees than any other state. This was in 1872, and Kansas was      the second to observe the day, falling into line in 1875.      Incidentally Kansas ranks next to Nebraska in dearth of trees.        The Arbor day idea originated with J. Sterling Morton, a Nebraskan      who was appointed secretary of agriculture by Cleveland. Now every      state in the Union recognizes the day and New York, Pennsylvania,      New Jersey, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and others have      gotten out extensive Arbor day booklets giving information      concerning trees and birds; most of them even contain appropriate      songs and poems for Arbor day programs.    How an interview combined with a description of a person may serve to  create sympathy for her and for the cause that she represents is shown  in the following article, which was published anonymously in the Sunday  magazine section of the _Ohio State Journal_. It was illustrated with  two half-tone portraits, one of the young woman in Indian costume, the  other showing her in street dress.        JUST LIKE POCAHONTAS OF 300 YEARS AGO       "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15721"],[0,"The Hawk of Egypt (#13)"],[1,"me not, for fear I shall pollute thee, thou woman of one  great race; thou descendant of one unbroken line; thou noble with  unblemished shield.\"    Then she leant right forward, and laid both hands upon his shoulders.  \"My son, my son, perchance could a very wise, very old woman help thee  in thy stress, for behold, she understands all things, having herself  passed through the troubled waters of life.\"    The fortune-teller shook his head as he gripped the little hands upon  his shoulders.    \"For me there is no help, wise, all-loving woman.  But she who loves  me, she whom I love and for whom I would die, even breaks her heart  through me, her first-born, in my desert home.  Her beautiful eyes are  full of tears, she lifts not her head, and my father, whom I honour, is  far from her in her stress.  Perchance in the golden mint of thy heart  hast thou a few coins of patience, wisdom and love to spare.\"    As the old woman got slowly to her feet, the man sprang up beside her.    \"My son, though thou drainest a fortune from the mint of Love at dawn,  yet is it still there at eventide,\" she whispered as she raised her  jewelled hand to his shoulders and pulled him down towards her.  \"My  son, thou art my son, and I have faith in and a great love for thee and  thine.\"    And she kissed him upon the forehead, whilst the tears stood in her  eyes, and turned towards the house, without noticing a man and a woman  sitting in the shadows at the far side of the grounds.    For the woman who watched was Zulannah the harlot, who had gained an  easy admission under the secrecy of her veils and the potency of  backschish.    And as Ben Kelham had sat down, she had crept quietly from behind the  palms to stand, a shimmering bundle of silks and satins, in front of  the man who looked up in annoyance, and then smiled.    You really couldn't be rude to anything so tantalisingly beautiful,  especially when the lady of your choice has just shown a certain  lamentable want of appreciation in regard to your person and  propositions.    \"It's one o'clock, fair lady; you must unmask.\"    And he uttered a cry of astonishment.    Zulannah had lifted her veil.    And the moments sped as she wove the golden web of beauty and desire  and love, into which, however, the clumsy fly refused to be enticed.    But Ben Kelham, for all his slowness, was no fool, and understanding  that the woman was offering him something outside her usual wares, and  understanding also the danger of rousing the wrath of such a woman, he  dealt with the matter as delicately as he could.    \"--Come but once to my entertainments,\" she urged.  \"My girls shall  dance for thee, my animals fight for thee.\"    The man shuddered, sick to the soul at the thought of the means by  which this woman enslaved her suitors.    \"Am I not beautiful?\" she added.    She made her last bid; she stepped back into the moonlight and unwound  her veils from about her, standing, palpitating, trembling under the  possession of her strange love.    Beautiful!  She was a dream--yet beside her beauty the pure loveliness  of Damaris Hethencourt would have shown like the work of an Old Master  beside a coarse copy.    But what will you?    Some like the snow-peaks and some the stretching plain; others the  turbulent ocean, and yet others the farmyard with its rural sights and  sounds.  Thank goodness for it!  Just imagine the lamentation  throughout the world if love, like the _couturiere_ set fashions for  the seasons!    \"Love dictates that women, this season, shall resemble the dazzling  peaks of the Himalayas.\"    And we looking as the majority of us _do_ look!    Not that we should really be downhearted about it.  Not a bit.  Only  let the decree go forth, and every one of us, at the end of a week or  so, would by hook or by crook have acquired a distinctly peak-like  appearance.    But Kelham looked up, looked long, and smiled.    \"You _are_ beautiful--very beautiful--the most beautiful woman I have  seen--save one.\"    Zulannah recognised her defeat and in a whirl of rage and scented veils  disappeared through the _talik_ palms.    And, arrived at her house, she stormed through court and rooms and down  to the bottom of the scented garden, leaving a trail of terror-stricken  servants lying face downwards in her wake.    She leant over the marble balustrade and looked down into the huge pit  with marble walls and sanded floor.  All around it were cages in which  were confined great beasts; and alcoves in which she and her guests,  behind iron bars, would sit, when sated with love and feasting, to  watch the animals fight to the death.    Then she ran quickly down the flight of marble steps, and clapped her  hands.    From some dark corner a shape came running, ambling like some gigantic  ape, maintaining an upright position by means of an occasional thrust  at the ground with the knuckles of the left hand.  The small eyes in  his large head blinked craftily at the beautiful woman--its own mate  being well-nigh as simian as itself--; it shuffled on its huge feet and  pulled at its gaudy raiment with abnormally long fingers.  The  monstrosity had been nicknamed \"Bes,\" after the monstrous dwarf god of  Ancient Egypt, by someone--the nationality of whom is of no  account--who had balanced the ardour of his studies with hours of  leisure in the bazaar.  The beasts, aroused doubtlessly by the scent of  the thing which brought them meat, roared and flung themselves against  the bars of the cage.    They were half-starved.    Unlike most of her class, Zulannah was mean.  She was a niggard in  things which did not concern herself.    So that, to feed his numerous progeny of repulsive simian shape, the  keeper of the cages starved the beasts.  Not that Zulannah cared one  iota for their hunger or suffering; it made them fight the merrier for  a bit of meat.    And she sat in her ebony chair close to the bars, with a brazier beside  her, and laughed delightedly as the liberated lion flung itself at the  cages in which roared its wretched brethren.    And then the great beast stopped suddenly in the middle of the den,  growling softly, snuffing the air.  Then, with heartrending roar hurled  itself straight at the bars behind which she sat.    Was she afraid?  Not one bit.  She was behind the bars.  She laughed  aloud and clapped her hands, standing just out of reach of the paw  which tried to reach her.    Back across the sand rushed the animal, and then with all its might  crashed against the barrier.    A look of horror swept the woman's face--the middle bar had bent.  She  sensed her danger, but kept her nerve.  Without hesitating, she turned  to the brazier at her side, carefully selected a handle well wrapped  about, and, turning again swiftly, thrust the red-hot point down the  lion's maw.    'Twere best not to describe the rest of the awful scene in which a  woman safe behind bars clapped her hands over the pain she had caused.    But is it surprising that Zulannah's enemies were legion?          CHAPTER X      \"_The wind that sighs before the dawn    Chases the gloom of night;    The curtains of the East are drawn    And suddenly--'tis light_.\"              SIR LEWIS MORRIS.      The desert stretched before Damaris.    As a lover, clad in golden raiment, in quick pursuit of his love with  dusky hair and starry eyes across a field of purple iris, Day flinging  wide his arms leaped clear of the horizon which lies like a string  across the sandy wastes.  Gathering her draperies, hiding her starry  jewels in misty scarves, Night fled in seeming fear, leaving behind her  a trail of sweet-scented, silver-embroidered purple, grey and saffron  garments, which melted in the warmth of love.    But leap he from the horizon ever so quickly, don he his most brilliant  armour and pursue he ever so hastily, yet, save for two short hours  when he may barely touch her hem, Night stands ever mockingly,  beckoning, just out of reach.    O thrice-wise woman!  How else would there be pursuit?    And Damaris laughed aloud from sheer content as she touched the  coal-black stallion with her heel, and held him, fretting, eager to be  away over the sand, to wherever Fate pointed.    Half-believing, half-doubting the words of the fortune-teller, this  early morning following hard upon her arrival in Heliopolis she slipped  from her room, wakened the astounded night-porter of the Desert Palace  Hotel, and demanded a car to be brought upon the instant.  And lucky it  was for her that she made one of the ducal party, for nothing else  would have procured her her heart's desire at that untoward hour before  dawn.    With Wellington beside her, she drove hard along the deserted high-road  towards the village of Makariyeh where, under a sycamore, 'tis said the  Virgin and Child rested on their Flight into Egypt.    The head-lights seemed to hurl the shadows back as she raced down the  Sharia el-Misalla towards the ruins of old Heliopolis, which is all  that remains of the great seat of learning, the biblical City of On.  And the sky lightened way down in the east as she drove along the outer  edge of the fort to the Obelisk, known to the Arab as el-Misalla.    And there the words of the fortune-teller came true, for fretting and  fuming in an endeavour to unseat his _sayis_, who rode him native-wise,  without his feet in the stirrups, rearing and backing at the sound of  the engine throbbing in the gloom, was the coal-black stallion of  Unayza.    Damaris did not cast a look at the Obelisk.  She had eyes only for the  beautiful beast which, seemingly, she was to ride on a single rein and  a wisp of a saddle.  Standing sixteen hands, born of the desert,  nervous and self-willed, he was no fit mount for a woman, and a gleam  of anxiety flashed across the _sayis's_ face as he measured the slender  girl with his eye and re-adjusted the stirrup-leather.    \"In the name of the hawk-headed Ra-Harakht.\"    The servant salaamed"]]]
