LESSON XIV.                         (Leccion decima cuarta.)                    INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS AND ADJECTIVES.      These are the same as the relative pronouns, only they are written with  an accent--    ?Quien,-es? (who, whom?)  ?Cual,-es? (which?)  ?Que? (what?)  ?Cuyo,-a,-os,-as? (whose?)  ?De quien,-es[103]? (whose?)  ?Cuanto,-a,-os,-as? (how much, how many?)    [Footnote 103: \"De quien\" is more usual than \"Cuyo\" in interrogations.]      _Cual_ when interrogative is used without the definite article which  must accompany it when it is a relative pronoun. _Quien_, interrogative,  is never an adjective.      EXAMPLES--    ?Quien vino a verme? Who came to see me?    ?Cual arreglo le gusta a V. mas? Which arrangement do you prefer?    ?Cuyo es este lapiz?         Whose is this pencil? _or_ Whose  ?Cuyo lapiz es este?         pencil is this?  ?De quien es este lapiz?    ?De quien recibio V. la consignacion de madera? From whom did you  receive the consignment of timber?    ?A quienes nos refieren Vs. para informes? To whom do you refer us for  information?    ?Cuanto me cobrara V.? How much will you charge me?    _Cual_ (which) is often used instead of the English \"what\", as--    ?Cuales son sus intenciones? What are your intentions?    _Que_ is used in exclamatory sentences--\"what a\", as--    iQue lastima! What a pity!  iQue bonitos panos! What nice suitings![104]    [Footnote 104: Before an adjective without a noun following \"que\"  translates the English \"how\":--iQue bonito! how nice!]    An emphatic _tan_ or _mas_ may be inserted, thus--    iQue pano tan bonito! What a very nice suiting!  iQue hombre mas rico! What a very rich man!    _Cual_ is used in exclamatory clauses instead of _como_ (how), as--    iCual le han reducido las desgracias! How (_or_ to what a state)       misfortunes have reduced him!  iCual la vi! How (_or_ in what a state) did I see her!    _Cuanto_ is also used in exclamations, as--    iCuanto le agradezco su amabilidad! How much obliged I am for your  kindness!    _Cual_ without article and without accent is used for \"as,\" as--    Una casa (tal) cual yo la deseaba: A house (such) as I liked.    Such expressions as \"He wrote me a letter, which letter I still  possess,\" are translated \"Me escribio una carta, cuya carta aun tengo.\"      _Subjunctive Mood, Imperfect Tense (2nd form)_.    +-----------------------+-------------+-----------+-------------+       =Haber=.           |  =Tener=.   | =Ser=.    | =Estar=.    |  +-----------------------+-------------+-----------+-------------+  |Que yo hubiera         |Tuviera      |Fuera      |Estuviera    |  | \"  tu hubieras        |Tuvieras     |Fueras     |Estuvieras   |  | \"  el hubiera         |Tuviera      |Fuera      |Estuviera    |  | \"  nosotros hubieramos|Tuvieramos   |Fueramos   |Estuvieramos |  | \"  vosotros hubierais |Tuvierais    |Fuerais    |Estuvierais  |  | \"  ellos hubieran     |Tuvieran     |Fueran     |Estuvieran   |  +-----------------------+-------------+-----------+-------------+      _Subjunctive Mood, Future Tense._      +-----------------------+--------------+------------+--------------+  |Que yo hubiere (that   |Tuviere (that |Fuere (that |Estuviere     |  |    I shall have,      | I shall have,| I shall be,| (that I shall|  |    etc.)              | etc.)        | etc.)      | be, etc.)    |  | \"  tu hubieres        |Tuvieres      |Fueres      |Estuvieres    |  | \"  el hubiere         |Tuviere       |Fuere       |Estuviere     |  | \"  nosotros hubieremos|Tuvieremos    |Fueremos    |Estuvieremos  |  | \"  vosotros hubiereis |Tuviereis     |Fuereis     |Estuviereis   |  | \"  ellos hubieren     |Tuvieren      |Fueren      |Estuvieren    |  +-----------------------+--------------+------------+--------------+      _Imperative Mood_.

So now they falsely said, that it was Suliman who had helped Zelie  to escape, and beyond himself with fury, Cheri commanded his  foster-brother to send soldiers to bring Suliman to him in chains,  like a criminal.    After giving these orders Cheri retired to his chamber, but scarcely  had he entered, when the earth trembled, there came a great clap of  thunder, and the Fairy Candide appeared before him.    \"I promised your father,\" said she in a stern voice, \"to give you  good advice, and to punish you if you refused to follow it. You  have despised my counsels and your crimes have converted you into a  monster, the horror of heaven and earth. Now it is time to fulfill my  promise of punishment. I condemn you to take the resemblance of the  beasts you are like in disposition--A lion, because of your fury--a  wolf, on account of your greediness--a serpent, for destroying him who  has been your second father--a bull, by reason of your brutality.\"    [Illustration]    Hardly had the Fairy pronounced these words, when Cheri perceived with  horror that his body had been transformed.    He had a lion's head, a bull's horns, the feet of a wolf, and the  tail of a viper. At the same moment he found himself in a forest, and  there, after roaming about miserably for some time, he fell into a  pit dug by hunters. He was captured and led into the capital of his  Kingdom.    On the way thither instead of acknowledging that he had brought this  evil plight upon himself, he bit at his chains, and cursed the Fairy.  As he was nearing the city great rejoicings were seen on every side,  and, on the hunters enquiring the reason, they were told that Prince  Cheri, whose only pleasure it was to torment his people, had been  crushed to death in his chamber by a thunder-bolt, a just punishment  for his offences. Four of his wicked companions had tried to partition  the Kingdom between them, but the people would have none such to rule,  and they had offered the crown to the good and wise Suliman. Cheri  panted with rage on hearing this, and in the Palace Square he saw  Suliman on a superb throne, and all the people who shouted with joy,  and wished him a long life to repair the evil brought about by their  former sovereign. \"I accept the throne,\" said Suliman, \"but it is to  preserve it for Prince Cheri. A fairy has revealed to me that he  is not dead, and possibly will return to you as virtuous as in his  earliest years. Alas!\" cried Suliman, bursting into tears, \"his  flatterers have ruined him, I know that at heart he is good.\" These  words moved Cheri to sorrow for his crimes, and he felt that he had  not been punished as severely as he deserved, and he now resolved to  amend his faults.    [Illustration]    Therefore he obeyed the man who had charge over him, and who  constantly cruelly beat him, and one day when this keeper lay asleep,  and a tiger who had broken loose was about to devour him, Cheri fought  the fierce beast, and saved the man's life.    Then a voice was heard saying, \"a good action shall be rewarded!\" and,  to Cheri's joy he was instantaneously transformed into a pretty little  dog which the keeper carried to the Queen.    The Queen was delighted with him, but, for fear he should grow bigger,  she gave him only small pieces of bread to eat, so that poor Cheri  nearly died of hunger.    One day he carried his little piece of bread into the garden to eat it  there, but wandering with it in his mouth, still further on, he saw a  young girl pale and thin, and almost fainting for want of food.    \"I am hungry,\" thought Cheri, \"but if I give my breakfast to this  poor thing, perhaps I shall save her life.\" He placed his bread in the  girl's hand, and she ate it hungrily. Just then he heard loud cries,  and saw that it was the beautiful Zelie struggling to free herself  from four men who were carrying her into a house near by.    Cheri, longing to help her, followed them barking, and although the  men kicked him savagely, he would not leave the place. Presently from  a window was thrown a plateful of tempting-looking food. Cheri was  just about to devour it, when the girl to whom he had given the bread,  rushed forward and throwing her arms around him cried,    [Illustration: \"COME, MY CHILDREN, I AM GOING TO TRANSPORT YOU TO YOUR  PALACE.\"]    \"Poor little dog, do not touch that food, it is poisoned.\" Just then  a voice was heard saying, \"You see that a good action meets with  reward,\" and at the same time Cheri was changed into a pretty white  pigeon. For several days he flew around hoping to catch sight of  Zelie, and at last, seated by a hermit, outside a cave, he found  her. Fluttering down he alighted upon her shoulder. Zelie stroked his  feathers whispering that she now accepted his gift and would love  him always, and at that moment Cheri regained his natural figure,  and Fairy Candide appeared in place of the hermit whose form she had  taken. \"Come, my children,\" said she, \"I am going to transport you  to your Palace, that Cheri may receive his crown of which he has now  become worthy,\" and hardly had she ceased speaking, when they found  themselves in Suliman's presence. The worthy Governor was delighted to  behold his dear master, and gladly resigned the throne to him. Cheri  and Zelie reigned long and happily, and we are told that the ring,  which the Prince now wore again, never once severely pricked him.          [Illustration]    THE WHITE CAT      There was once a King who had three sons, all handsome and brave, but  it came to his ears that they wished to reign now instead of waiting  until he died, he therefore determined to divert their minds by making  promises the fulfilment of which he would always be able to evade. So  he called them to his room and spoke: \"You must agree with me, my  dear children, that at my great age I cannot manage the business of  my kingdom as I used to do, and as I am intending retiring into the  country, it seems to me that a clever, faithful dog would be very good  company, and I promise you that whichever brings me the most beautiful  little dog at once succeeds to the kingdom.\"    The Princes were much surprised to hear their father's wish for a  little dog, but agreed with pleasure to go in search of one. They said  goodbye to the King, who gave them money and jewels, announcing that  in a year he should expect them to return, all on the same day and at  the same hour, bringing to him their little dogs.    [Illustration: \"ON A CERTAIN NIGHT, DURING A STORM OF THUNDER AND  RAIN, HE LOST HIS WAY.\"]    Then the Princes set out, each by a different road, agreeing in a  year's time to meet at a certain place a short distance from their  home.    The two elder met with many adventures, but it is only the youngest  that we shall follow.    This youngest Prince was very courteous, merry, clever and  accomplished, he was tall, handsome, and all that a prince should be.    Very seldom a day passed without his buying dogs, little dogs, big  dogs, sporting dogs, spaniels, hounds, dogs of all sorts. When he  found a beautiful one and then came across a still better, he let the  first one go, for being alone--the Princes had declined to take any  attendants--he could not take charge of thirty or forty thousand dogs.    He travelled on, keeping to one road, until on a certain night, during  a storm of thunder and rain, he lost his way, and after some wandering  arrived at a most superb castle where nobody was to be seen but about  a dozen hands all holding torches. Other hands pushed him forwards,  and guided him through one apartment after another, all so rich in  precious stones and beautiful paintings, that it was like enchantment.    After passing through sixty rooms, the hands stopped him, and here the  wet garments of the Prince were taken away, and he was clad in raiment  of the most exquisite description. The hands then conducted him into  a banqueting hall, where entered a little figure, not two feet high,  covered with a long black crepe veil, followed by a great procession  of cats.    The Prince was too much astonished to move. The little figure  approached him, raising the veil, and he saw the most beautiful White  Cat he had ever beheld.    Addressing the Prince she said:    \"King's son! welcome! my Feline Majesty sees you with pleasure!\"    \"Madame Cat,\" replied the Prince, \"it is very good of you to receive  me thus, but you are not an ordinary cat; being able to speak, and  possessing this superb castle, are proof of that.\"    After they had conversed a little while, supper was served to them,  during which the Prince entertained the Cat by telling her all sorts  of news, and he discovered that she was well informed as to what was  taking place in the world.    Supper over, various cats came in, dressed in fancy costumes, and  danced a ballet, then the White Cat bid her visitor good-night, and  the hands which had conducted him before, led him to a bed-chamber.    Early the next morning the hands awoke him, and dressing him in a  handsome hunting costume, led him to the courtyard, where he found the  White Cat upon a splendid monkey, with about five hundred other cats  assembled, all ready for the chase; and never had the Prince enjoyed  anything so much, for although mounted only upon a wooden horse, he  rode at a great pace.    Day after day passed in such delights as made the Prince almost forget  his own country.    \"Alas!\" said he to the White Cat again and again, \"how sad I shall be  to leave you! I love you so dearly! Either become a woman, or change  me into a cat!\"    A year passes very quickly when one has no care or trouble, and is  enjoying life. But the White Cat"]]]
