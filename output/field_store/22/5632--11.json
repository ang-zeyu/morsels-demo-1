[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17132"],[0,"The Makers of Canada: Champlain (#13)"],[1,"had always been to  introduce Christianity in order to civilize the people. Thus we find in  his writings after his return to France in 1614, the words:    \"Without losing courage, I have not ceased to push on and visit various  nations of the savages, and by associating familiarly with them, I have  concluded, as well from their conversation as from the knowledge  attained, that there is no better way than, disregarding all storms and  difficulties, to have patience until His Majesty shall give the  requisite attention to the matter, and in the meantime to continue the  exploration of the country, but also to learn the language, and form  relations and friendship with the leading men of the villages and  tribes, in order to lay the foundations of a permanent edifice, as well  for the glory of God as for the renown of the French.\"    It is well to observe the significance of these words from the pen of  Champlain. Is this the language of a common fur-trader, simply seeking  to increase his fortune? What were really Champlain's designs during all  these years of labour and self-sacrifice? Was he animated by the mere  curiosity of the tourist, or the ambition of a man of science? No.  Champlain desired, it is true, to gain an intimate knowledge of the  country, and his labours are highly valued as a geographer and  cosmographer, but his intention was to utilize all his varied  information to promote the Christian religion and at the same time to  increase the renown of his native land.    Champlain deserves credit, not only for the idea of bringing  missionaries to Canada, but also for having realized his ideas. He  obtained the cooeperation of many pious and zealous persons in France,  who willingly seconded his efforts, but it was owing to his own  steadfastness of purpose and to his great ability that his designs were  successfully carried out. After having formed a society of merchants to  take the material affairs of the colony in hand, Champlain tried to get  some religious orders to assume the direction of spiritual matters. He  had previously made known his plan to Louis Houeel, king's councillor,  and comptroller of the salt works at Brouage, and sieur of Petit-Pre.  Houeel was an honourable and pious man, and a friend of Champlain. He  told him that he was acquainted with some Recollets who would readily  agree to proceed to New France. Houeel met Father du Verger, a man of  great virtue and ability, and principal of the order of the Immaculate  Conception. Father du Verger made an appeal to his confreres, all of  whom offered their services, and were ready to cross the ocean.    The cardinals and bishops who were then gathered at St. Denis for their  great chapter, were in favour of the idea of sending the Recollets to  their foreign missions, and promised to raise a fund for the maintenance  of four monks, and the merchants of Rouen promised to maintain and  convey at least six Recollets gratuitously. The king issued letters for  the future church of Canada. The pope's nuncio, Guido Bentivoglio,  granted the requisite permission, in conformity with the pope's wishes,  but the bull establishing the church was only forwarded on May 20th,  1615. The brief of Paul V granted to the Recollets the following  privileges:    \"To receive all children born of believing and unbelieving parents, and  all others of what condition soever they may be, who, after promising to  keep and observe all that should be kept and observed by the faithful,  will embrace the truth of the Christian and Catholic faith; to baptize  even outside of the churches in case of necessity; to hear confessions  of penitents, and after diligently hearing them, to impose a salutary  penance according to their faults, and enjoin what should be enjoined in  conscience, to loose and absolve them from all sentences of  excommunication and other ecclesiastical pains and censures, as also  from all sorts of crimes, excesses, and delicts; to administer the  sacraments of the eucharist, marriage and extreme unction; to bless all  kinds of vestments, vessels and ornaments when holy unction is not  necessary; to dispense gratuitously new converts who have contracted or  would contract marriage in any degree of consanguinity, or affinity  whatever, except the first or second, or between ascending and  descending, provided the women have not been carried off by force, and  the two parties who have contracted or would contract be Catholics, and  there be just cause as well for the marriages already contracted as for  those desired to be contracted; to declare and pronounce the children  born and issued of such marriages legitimate; to have an altar which  they may decently carry, and thereon to celebrate in decent and becoming  places where the convenience of a church shall be wanting.\"    The Reverend Father Garnier de Chapouin, provincial of the province of  St. Denis, appointed four monks as the founders of the future mission.  Their names were Father Denis Jamet, Jean d'Olbeau, Joseph Le Caron, and  a brother named Pacifique du Plessis, who received orders to accompany  them. These four monks were all remarkable for their virtue and  apostolic zeal. Father Jamet was appointed commissary, and Father  d'Olbeau was appointed his successor in the event of death. The king  granted them authority to build one or more convents in Canada, and to  send for as many monks as were required. It was impossible to send more  than four of them during the first year.    On April 24th, 1615, the _St. Etienne_ sailed from Honfleur, and one  month later came to anchor at Tadousac. On June 25th, Father d'Olbeau  was able to say mass in a small chapel built at the foot of Mountain  Hill, Quebec.    Soon after his arrival at Quebec, Champlain set out for the falls,  accompanied by Father Jamet. They reached the river des Prairies some  days after, and on June 24th, Father Jamet celebrated a solemn mass, at  which Champlain and some others assisted. This was the first mass  celebrated in Canada since the days of Jacques Cartier.    In the early days of the settlement these brave missionaries had to  contend with many difficulties, which could be foreseen only by those  who were acquainted with the existing state of affairs. Many of these  difficulties arose from the fact that at least a fourth of the merchants  of the company were members of the so-called reformed, or Calvinistic  persuasion. It is easy to comprehend that the sympathies of these men  would not incline towards the Catholic religion.    Champlain draws particular attention to the unfortunate results produced  by the existence of different creeds. Differences arose, and divisions  were created which sometimes resulted in quarrels between children of  the same country. These quarrels which were much to be deplored, did  not, however, occur in Quebec, because the French merchants did not deem  it advisable to send their ministers there, but replaced them by agents  who were often fanatical, and were for the Recollets a frequent source  of bitterness and annoyance. The most of the disorders occurred on board  the vessels, and were due to the fact that the crews were too hastily  engaged.    The merchants, however, were bound to colonize the country with Catholic  settlers, and de Monts was also bound by similar conditions. Moreover,  the terms of the patents expressly stipulated that this should be  carried out. They were also forbidden to extend Calvinism among the  savages. \"This policy,\" says Bancroft, \"was full of wisdom.\" The  interpreters who could have greatly assisted the missionaries, proved on  the contrary an obstacle to the development of the Catholic religion,  for they refused to instruct the Recollets in the Indian languages,  which they had learnt before the arrival of the missionaries.    Father Lalemant, a Jesuit, wrote in the year 1626: \"This interpreter had  never wanted to communicate his knowledge of the language to any one,  not even to the Reverend Recollet Fathers, who had constantly importuned  him for ten years.\" So also wrote Father Le Jeune in his Relation of  1633.    The difficulties that the missionaries had to overcome are therefore  readily understood. However they had the merit of preparing the way for  their successors, and the honour of planting the cross of Jesus Christ  everywhere, from Tadousac to Lake Huron.    The number of missionaries was limited at the commencement, but some  others came to Canada later, particularly Fathers Guillaume Poullain,  Georges Le Baillif, and Paul Huet. These men, some of whom were of noble  birth, were remarkable for their virtues and their abilities. In the  annals of the primitive church of New France, their names are  illustrious, and around their memory gathers the aureole of sanctity.  During six years, from 1615 to 1621, the spiritual direction of the  colony was entrusted to six fathers and three friars. Father d'Olbeau  remained in charge of the habitation of Quebec, and Father Le Caron  resolved to proceed at once to the country of the Hurons.    On July 9th, 1615, Champlain, Etienne Brule, an interpreter, a servant,  and ten Indians, set out for the mouth of the Ottawa River. They rowed  up the river as far as the Mattawan, which they followed westwards, and  soon reached Lake Nipissing where they stopped for two days. This was on  July 26th. After having taken this short rest, they continued their  voyage, crossing Georgian Bay, and reached the land of the Hurons. Near  the shore they met the Attignaouantans, or people of the bear tribe, one  of the four chief branches of the great Huron family. Their village or  _bourgade_ was called Otouacha. On the second day of August, Champlain's  party visited the village of Carmeron, and on the following day, they  saw the encampments of Tonaguainchain, Tequenonquiaye and Carhagouha. In  the latter encampment Father Le Caron resided.    [Illustration: Champlain on the shores of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17144"],[0,"The House of the Vampire (#13)"],[1," transformed into potential  reality the dream of perpetual motion. The fundamental notions of  mathematics are being undermined. One school of philosophers claims that  the number of angles in a triangle is equal to more than two right  angles; another propounds that it is less. Even great scientists who  have studied the soul of nature are turning to spiritism. The world is  overcoming the shallow scepticism of the nineteenth century. Life has  become once more wonderful and very mysterious. But it also seems that,  with the miracles of the old days, their terrors, their nightmares and  their monsters have come back in a modern guise.\"    Ernest became even more thoughtful. \"Yes,\" he observed, \"there is  something in what you say.\" Then, pacing the room nervously, he  exclaimed: \"And still I find it impossible to believe your explanation.  Reginald a vampire! It seems so ludicrous. If you had told me that such  creatures exist somewhere, far away, I might have discussed the matter;  but in this great city, in the shadow of the Flatiron Building--no!\"    She replied with warmth: \"Yet they exist--always have existed. Not only  in the Middle Ages, but at all times and in all regions. There is no  nation but has some record of them, in one form or another. And don't  you think if we find a thought, no matter how absurd it may seem to us,  that has ever occupied the minds of men--if we find, I say, such a  perennially recurrent thought, are we not justified in assuming that it  must have some basis in the actual experience of mankind?\"    Ernest's brow became very clouded, and infinite numbers of hidden  premature wrinkles began to show. How wan he looked and how frail! He  was as one lost in a labyrinth in which he saw no light, convinced  against his will, or rather, against his scientific conviction, that she  was not wholly mistaken.    \"Still,\" he observed triumphantly, \"your vampires suck blood; but  Reginald, if vampire he be, preys upon the soul. How can a man suck  from another man's brain a thing as intangible, as quintessential as  thought?\"    \"Ah,\" she replied, \"you forget, thought is more real than blood!\"          XXV      Only three hours had passed since Ethel had startled Ernest from his  sombre reveries, but within this brief space their love had matured as  if each hour had been a year. The pallor had vanished from his cheeks  and the restiveness from his eyes. The intoxication of her presence had  rekindled the light of his countenance and given him strength to combat  the mighty forces embodied in Reginald Clarke. The child in him had made  room for the man. He would not hear of surrendering without a struggle,  and Ethel felt sure she might leave his fate in his own hand. Love had  lent him a coat of mail. He was warned, and would not succumb. Still she  made one more attempt to persuade him to leave the house at once with  her.    \"I must go now,\" she said. \"Will you not come with me, after all? I am  so afraid to think of you still here.\"    \"No, dear,\" he replied. \"I shall not desert my post. I must solve the  riddle of this man's life; and if, indeed, he is the thing he seems to  be, I shall attempt to wrest from him what he has stolen from me. I  speak of my unwritten novel.\"    \"Do not attempt to oppose him openly. You cannot resist him.\"    \"Be assured that I shall be on my guard. I have in the last few hours  lived through so much that makes life worth living, that I would not  wantonly expose myself to any danger. Still, I cannot go without  certainty--cannot, if there is some truth in our fears, leave the best  of me behind.\"    \"What are you planning to do?\"    \"My play--I am sure now that it is mine--I cannot take from him; that is  irretrievably lost. He has read it to his circle and prepared for its  publication. And, no matter how firmly convinced you or I may be of his  strange power, no one would believe our testimony. They would pronounce  us mad. Perhaps we _are_ mad!\"    \"No; we are not mad; but it is mad for you to stay here,\" she asserted.    \"I shall not stay here one minute longer than is absolutely essential.  Within a week I shall have conclusive proof of his guilt or innocence.\"    \"How will you go about it?\"    \"His writing table--\"    \"Ah!\"    \"Yes, perhaps I can discover some note, some indication, some proof--\"    \"It's a dangerous game.\"    \"I have everything to gain.\"    \"I wish I could stay here with you,\" she said. \"Have you no friend, no  one whom you could trust in this delicate matter?\"    \"Why, yes--Jack.\"    A shadow passed over her face.    \"Do you know,\" she said, \"I have a feeling that you care more for him  than for me?\"    \"Nonsense,\" he said, \"he is my friend, you, you--immeasurably more.\"    \"Are you still as intimate with him as when I first met you?\"    \"Not quite; of late a troubling something, like a thin veil, seems to  have passed between us. But he will come when I call him. He will not  fail me in my hour of need.\"    \"When can he be here?\"    \"In two or three days.\"    \"Meanwhile be very careful. Above all, lock your door at night.\"    \"I will not only lock, but barricade it. I shall try with all my power  to elucidate this mystery without, however, exposing myself to needless  risks.\"    \"I will go, then. Kiss me good-bye.\"    \"May I not take you to the car?\"    \"You had better not.\"    At the door she turned back once more. \"Write me every day, or call me  up on the telephone.\"    He straightened himself, as if to convince her of his strength. Yet when  at last the door had closed behind her, his courage forsook him for a  moment. And, if he had not been ashamed to appear a weakling before the  woman he loved, who knows if any power on earth could have kept him in  that house where from every corner a secret seemed to lurk!    There was a misgiving, too, in the woman's heart as she left the boy  behind,--a prey to the occult power that, seeking expression in multiple  activities, has made and unmade emperors, prophets and poets.    As she stepped into a street car she saw from afar, as in a vision, the  face of Reginald Clarke. It seemed very white and hungry. There was no  human kindness in it--only a threat and a sneer.          XXVI      For over an hour Ernest paced up and down his room, wildly excited by  Ethel's revelations. It required an immense amount of self-control for  him to pen the following lines to Jack: \"I need you. Come.\"    After he had entrusted the letter to the hall-boy, a reaction set in and  he was able to consider the matter, if not with equanimity, at least  with a degree of calmness. The strangest thing to him was that he could  not bring himself to hate Reginald, of whose evil influence upon his  life he was now firmly convinced. Here was another shattered idol; but  one--like the fragment of a great god-face in the desert--intensely  fascinating, even in its ruin. Then yielding to a natural impulse,  Ernest looked over his photographs and at once laid hold upon the  austere image of his master and friend. No--it was preposterous; there  was no evil in this man. There was no trace of malice in this face, the  face of a prophet or an inspired madman, a poet. And yet, as he  scrutinised the picture closely a curious transformation seemed to take  place in the features; a sly little line appeared insinuatingly about  Reginald's well-formed mouth, and the serene calm of his Jupiter-head  seemed to turn into the sneak smile of a thief. Nevertheless, Ernest was  not afraid. His anxieties had at last assumed definite shape; it was  possible now to be on his guard. It is only invisible, incomprehensible  fear, crouching upon us from the night, that drives sensitive natures to  the verge of madness and transforms stern warriors into cowards.    Ernest realised the necessity of postponing the proposed investigation  of Reginald's papers until the morning, as it was now near eleven, and  he expected to hear at any moment the sound of his feet at the door.  Before retiring he took a number of precautions. Carefully he locked the  door to his bedroom and placed a chair in front of it. To make doubly  sure, he fastened the handle to an exquisite Chinese vase, a gift of  Reginald's, that at the least attempt to force an entrance from without  would come down with a crash.    Then, although sleep seemed out of the question, he went to bed. He had  hardly touched the pillow when a leaden weight seemed to fall upon his  eyes. The day's commotion had been too much for his delicate frame. By  force of habit he pulled the cover over his ear and fell asleep.    All night he slept heavily, and the morning was far advanced when a  knock at the door that, at first, seemed to come across an immeasurable  distance, brought him back to himself. It was Reginald's manservant  announcing that breakfast was waiting.    Ernest got up and rubbed his eyes. The barricade at the door at once  brought back to his mind with startling clearness the events of the  previous evening.    Everything was as he had left it. Evidently no one had attempted to  enter the room while he slept. He could not help smiling at the  arrangement which reminded him of his childhood, when he had sought by  similar means security from burglars and bogeys. And in the broad  daylight Ethel's tales of vampires seemed once more impossible and  absurd. Still, he had abundant evidence of Reginald's strange influence,  and was determined to know the truth before nightfall. Her words, that  thought is more real than blood, kept ringing in his ears. If such was  the case, he would find evidence of Reginald's intellectual burglaries,  and possibly be able to regain a part of his lost self that had been  snatched from him by the relentless dream-hand.    But under no circumstances could he face Reginald in his present state  of mind. He was convinced that if in the fleeting vision of a moment the  other man's true nature should reveal itself to him, he would be so  terribly"]]]
