which was received with universal acclamations, terminated  the ceremonial peculiar to the day. Nor was it altogether without its  proper effect: For we are informed, that in the course of the ensuing  week fourteen marriages took place among the convicts. The assembly was  now dispersed, and the Governor proceeded to review the troops on the  ground cleared for a parade: after which, he gave a dinner to the  officers, and the first evening of his government was concluded  propitiously, in good order and innocent festivity, amidst the repetition  of wishes for its prosperity.    A rising government could not easily be committed to better hands.  Governor Phillip appears to have every requisite to ensure the success of  the undertaking intrusted to him, as far as the qualities of one man can  ensure it. Intelligent, active, persevering with firmness to make his  authority respected, and mildness to render it pleasing, he was  determined, if possible, to bring even the native inhabitants of New  South Wales into a voluntary subjection; or at least to establish with  them a strict amity and alliance. Induced also by motives of humanity, it  was his determination from his first landing, to treat them with the  utmost kindness: and he was firmly resolved, that, whatever differences  might arise, nothing less than the most absolute necessity should ever  compel him to fire upon them. In this resolution, by good fortune, and by  his own great address, he has happily been enabled to persevere. But  notwithstanding this, his intentions of establishing a friendly  intercourse have hitherto been frustrated. M. De la Peyrouse,* while he  remained in Botany Bay, had some quarrel with the inhabitants, which  unfortunately obliged him to use his fire-arms against them: this affair,  joined to the ill behaviour of some of the convicts, who in spite of all  prohibitions, and at the risque of all consequences, have wandered out  among them, has produced a shyness on their parts which it has not yet  been possible to remove, though the properest means have been taken to  regain their confidence. Their dislike to the Europeans is probably  increased by discovering that they intend to remain among them, and that  they interfere with them in some of their best fishing places, which  doubtless are, in their circumstances, objects of very great importance.  Some of the convicts who have straggled into the woods have been killed,  and others dangerously wounded by the natives, but there is great reason  to suppose that in these cases the convicts have usually been the  aggressors.    [* This is the right form of that officer's name; it was printed otherwise  in a former passage by mistake.]    As the month of February advanced heavy rains began to fall, which  pointed out the necessity of procuring shelter for the people as soon as  possible. To have expedited this work in the degree which was desirable a  great number of artificers would have been required. But this advantage  could not be had. Only sixteen carpenters could be hired from all the  ships; among the convicts no more than twelve were of this profession,  and of them several were sick. These therefore together formed but a  small party, in proportion to the work which was to be done. One hundred  convicts were added as labourers; but with every effort, it was found  impossible to complete either the barracks for the men, or the huts for  the officers, as soon as was desired. As late as the middle of May these  were yet unfinished, as well as the hospital, and the storehouse for  those provisions which were not landed at first. The Governor himself at  that time was still lodged in his temporary house of canvas, which was  not perfectly impervious either to wind or weather.    14 February 1788.    On the 14th of February a party was sent out in the Supply, to settle on  a small island to the north-west of New Zealand, in latitude 29 deg. south,  and longitude 168 deg.. 10'. east from London, which was discovered and much  commended by Captain Cook, and by him named Norfolk Island, in honour of  the noble family to which that title belongs. To the office of  superintendant and commandant of this island, and the settlement to be  made upon it, Governor Phillip appointed Philip Gidley King, second  lieutenant of his Majesty's ship Sirius, an officer much esteemed by him  as of great merit in his profession; and highly spoken of in his letters  as a man, whose perseverance in that or any other service might fully be  depended on. As it was known that there were no inhabitants on Norfolk  Island, there was sent with Lieut. King only a small detachment,  consisting of one subaltern officer, and six marines, a very promising  young man who was a midshipman, a surgeon,* two men who understood the  cultivation and dressing of flax, with nine men and six women convicts.  That the nature of this settlement may be fully understood, a copy of the  instructions delivered to Mr. King at his departure is subjoined to this  chapter.    [* The surgeon's name is Jamison, whose intelligent letters to Lewis  Wolfe, Esq; were kindly lent to the publisher, and have afforded much  useful information.]      INSTRUCTIONS for PHILIP GIDLEY KING, Esq; Superintendant and Commandant  of the Settlement of NORFOLK ISLAND.    With these instructions you will receive my Commission, appointing you to  superintend and command the settlement to be formed in Norfolk Island,  and to obey all such orders as you shall from time to time receive from  me, his Majesty's Governor in Chief, and Captain General of the territory  of New South Wales and its dependencies, or from the Lieutenant-Governor  in my absence.    You are therefore to proceed in his Majesty's armed tender Supply, whose  commander has my orders to receive you, with the men and women, stores  and provisions necessary for forming the intended settlement; and on your  landing on Norfolk Island you are to take upon you the execution of the  trust reposed in you, causing my commission, appointing you  superintendant over the said settlement, to be publicly read.    After having taken the necessary measures for securing yourself and  people, and for the preservation of the stores and provisions, you are  immediately to proceed to the cultivation of the Flax Plant, which you  will find growing spontaneously on the island: as likewise to the  cultivation of cotton, corn, and other plants, with the seeds of which  you are furnished, and which you are to regard as public stock, and of  the increase of which you are to send me an account, that I may know what  quantity may be drawn from the island for public use, or what supplies it  may be necessary to send hereafter. It is left to your discretion to use  such part of the corn that is raised as may be found necessary; but this  you are to do with the greatest oeconomy; and as the corn, flax, cotton,  and other grains are the property of the Crown, and as such are to be  accounted for, you are to keep an exact account of the increase, and you  will in future receive directions for the disposal thereof.    You are to inform yourself of the nature of the soil, what proportion of  land you find proper for the cultivation of corn, flax, and cotton, as  likewise what quantity of cattle may be bred on the island, and the  number of people you judge necessary for the above purpose. You will  likewise observe what are the prevailing winds in the different seasons  of the year, the best anchorage according to the season, the rise and  fall of the tides, likewise when the dry and rainy seasons begin and end.    You will be furnished with a four oared boat, and you are not on any  consideration to build, or to permit the building of any vessel or boat  whatever that is decked; or of any boat or vessel that is not decked,  whose length of keel exceeds twenty feet: and if by any accident any  vessel or boat that exceeds twenty feet keel should be driven on the  island, you are immediately to cause such boat or vessel to be scuttled,  or otherwise rendered unserviceable, letting her remain in that situation  until you receive further directions from me.    You will be furnished with six months provisions, within which time you  will receive an additional supply, but as you will be able to procure  fish and vegetables, you are to endeavour to make the provisions you  receive serve as long as possible.    The convicts being the servants of the Crown, till the time for which  they are sentenced is expired, their labour is to be for the public; and  you are to take particular notice of their general good or bad behaviour,  that they may hereafter be employed or rewarded according to their  different merits.    You are to cause the Prayers of the Church of England to be read with all  due solemnity every Sunday, and you are to inforce a due observance of  religion and good order, transmitting to me, as often as opportunity  offers, a full account of your particular situation and transactions.    You are not to permit any intercourse or trade with any ships or vessels  that may stop at the island, whether English or of any other nation,  unless such ships or vessels should be in distress, in which case you are  to afford them such assistance as may be in your power.    Given under my hand, at Head Quarters in Port Jackson, New South Wales,  this 12th day of February, 1788.    (Signed)    ARTHUR PHILLIP.      Chapter IX.
