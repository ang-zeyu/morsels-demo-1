We can have such chains as long as you please, thirty or more  in a chain; they are all contained in kerosene and paraffin.    So far the chemist found it east to construct diagrams that would  satisfy his sense of the fitness of things, but when he found that  benzene had the compostion C_{6}H_{6} he was puzzled. If you try to draw  the picture of C_{6}H_{6} you will get something like this:       | | | | | |    -C-C-C-C-C-C-     | | | | | |     H H H H H H    which is an absurdity because more than half of the carbon hands are  waving wildly around asking to be held by something. Benzene,  C_{6}H_{6}, evidently is like hexane, C_{6}H_{14}, in having a chain of  six carbon atoms, but it has dropped its H's like an Englishman. Eight  of the H's are missing.    Now one of the men who was worried over this benzene puzzle was the  German chemist, Kekule. One evening after working over the problem all  day he was sitting by the fire trying to rest, but he could not throw  it off his mind. The carbon and the hydrogen atoms danced like imps on  the carpet and as he watched them through his half-closed eyes he  suddenly saw that the chain of six carbon atoms had joined at the ends  and formed a ring while the six hydrogen atoms were holding on to the  outside hands, in this fashion:          H        |        C       / \\\\    H-C   C-H      ||  |    H-C   C-H       \\ //        C        |        H    Professor Kekule saw at once that the demons of his subconscious self  had furnished him with a clue to the labyrinth, and so it proved. We  need not suppose that the benzene molecule if we could see it would look  anything like this diagram of it, but the theory works and that is all  the scientist asks of any theory. By its use thousands of new compounds  have been constructed which have proved of inestimable value to man. The  modern chemist is not a discoverer, he is an inventor. He sits down at  his desk and draws a \"Kekule ring\" or rather hexagon. Then he rubs out  an H and hooks a nitro group (NO_{2}) on to the carbon in place of it;  next he rubs out the O_{2} of the nitro group and puts in H_{2}; then he  hitches on such other elements, or carbon chains and rings as he likes.  He works like an architect designing a house and when he gets a picture  of the proposed compounds to suit him he goes into the laboratory to  make it. First he takes down the bottle of benzene and boils up some of  this with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. This he puts in the nitro group  and makes nitro-benzene, C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2}. He treats this with hydrogen,  which displaces the oxygen and gives C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2} or aniline, which  is the basis of so many of these compounds that they are all commonly  called \"the aniline dyes.\" But aniline itself is not a dye. It is a  colorless or brownish oil.    It is not necessary to follow our chemist any farther now that we have  seen how he works, but before we pass on we will just look at one of his  products, not one of the most complicated but still complicated enough.    [Illustration: A molecule of a coal-tar dye]    The name of this is sodium ditolyl-disazo-beta-naphthylamine-  6-sulfonic-beta-naphthylamine-3.6-disulfonate.    These chemical names of organic compounds are discouraging to the  beginner and amusing to the layman, but that is because neither of them  realizes that they are not really words but formulas. They are  hyphenated because they come from Germany. The name given above is no  more of a mouthful than \"a-square-plus-two-a-b-plus-b-square\" or \"Third  Assistant Secretary of War to the President of the United States of  America.\" The trade name of this dye is Brilliant Congo, but while that  is handier to say it does not mean anything. Nobody but an expert in  dyes would know what it was, while from the formula name any chemist  familiar with such compounds could draw its picture, tell how it would  behave and what it was made from, or even make it. The old alchemist was  a secretive and pretentious person and used to invent queer names for  the purpose of mystifying and awing the ignorant. But the chemist in  dropping the al- has dropped the idea of secrecy and his names, though  equally appalling to the layman, are designed to reveal and not to  conceal.    From this brief explanation the reader who has not studied chemistry  will, I think, be able to get some idea of how these very intricate  compounds are built up step by step. A completed house is hard to  understand, but when we see the mason laying one brick on top of another  it does not seem so difficult, although if we tried to do it we should  not find it so easy as we think. Anyhow, let me give you a hint. If you  want to make a good impression on a chemist don't tell him that he  seems to you a sort of magician, master of a black art, and all that  nonsense. The chemist has been trying for three hundred years to live  down the reputation of being inspired of the devil and it makes him mad  to have his past thrown up at him in this fashion. If his tactless  admirers would stop saying \"it is all a mystery and a miracle to me,  and I cannot understand it\" and pay attention to what he is telling them  they would understand it and would find that it is no more of a mystery  or a miracle than anything else. You can make an electrician mad in the  same way by interrupting his explanation of a dynamo by asking: \"But you  cannot tell me what electricity really is.\" The electrician does not  care a rap what electricity \"really is\"--if there really is any meaning  to that phrase. All he wants to know is what he can do with it.    [Illustration: COMPARISON OF COAL AND ITS DISTILLATION PRODUCTS From  Hesse's \"The Industry of the Coal Tar Dyes,\" _Journal of Industrial and  Engineering Chemistry_, December, 1914]    The tar obtained from the gas plant or the coke plant has now to be  redistilled, giving off the ten \"crudes\" already mentioned and leaving  in the still sixty-five per cent. of pitch, which may be used for  roofing, paving and the like. The ten primary products or crudes are  then converted into secondary products or \"intermediates\" by processes  like that for the conversion of benzene into aniline. There are some  three hundred of these intermediates in use and from them are built up  more than three times as many dyes. The year before the war the American  custom house listed 5674 distinct brands of synthetic dyes imported,  chiefly from Germany, but some of these were trade names for the same  product made by different firms or represented by different degrees of  purity or form of preparation. Although the number of possible products  is unlimited and over five thousand dyes are known, yet only about nine  hundred are in use. We can summarize the situation so:      Coal-tar --> 10 crudes --> 300 intermediates --> 900 dyes --> 5000 brands.    Or, to borrow the neat simile used by Dr. Bernhard C. Hesse, it is like  cloth-making where \"ten fibers make 300 yarns which are woven into 900  patterns.\"    The advantage of the artificial dyestuffs over those found in nature  lies in their variety and adaptability. Practically any desired tint or  shade can be made for any particular fabric. If my lady wants a new kind  of green for her stockings or her hair she can have it. Candies and  jellies and drinks can be made more attractive and therefore more  appetizing by varied colors. Easter eggs and Easter bonnets take on new  and brighter hues.    More and more the chemist is becoming the architect of his own fortunes.  He does not make discoveries by picking up a beaker and pouring into it  a little from each bottle on the shelf to see what happens. He generally  knows what he is after, and he generally gets it, although he is still  often baffled and occasionally happens on something quite unexpected and  perhaps more valuable than what he was looking for. Columbus was looking  for India when he ran into an obstacle that proved to be America.  William Henry Perkin was looking for quinine when he blundered into that  rich and undiscovered country, the aniline dyes. William Henry was a  queer boy. He had rather listen to a chemistry lecture than eat. When he  was attending the City of London School at the age of thirteen there was  an extra course of lectures on chemistry given at the noon recess, so he  skipped his lunch to take them in. Hearing that a German chemist named  Hofmann had opened a laboratory in the Royal College of London he headed  for that. Hofmann obviously had no fear of forcing the young intellect  prematurely. He perhaps had never heard that \"the tender petals of the  adolescent mind must be allowed to open slowly.\" He admitted young  Perkin at the age of fifteen and started him on research at the end of  his second year. An American student nowadays thinks he is lucky if he  gets started on his research five years older than Perkin. Now if  Hofmann had studied pedagogical psychology he would have been informed  that nothing chills the ardor of the adolescent mind like being set at  tasks too great for its powers. If he had heard this and believed it, he  would not have allowed Perkin to spend two years in fruitless endeavors  to isolate phenanthrene from coal tar and to prepare artificial  quinine--and in that case Perkin would never have discovered the aniline  dyes. But Perkin, so far from being discouraged, set up a private  laboratory so he could work over-time. While working here during the  Easter vacation of 1856--the date is as well worth remembering as  1066--he was oxidizing some aniline oil when he got what chemists most  detest, a black, tarry mass instead of nice, clean crystals. When he  went to wash this out with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17160"],[0,"Modern Prose And Poetry; For Secondary Schools (#13)"],[1,"be  only three to one. By this the whole matter had presented itself to them  as an entertainment more diverting than bullfight or bear-baiting. They  that follow the sea, whether honest men or black-hearted knaves, have in  their composition a certain childlikeness that makes them easily turned,  easily led, and easily pleased. The wind of their passion shifts quickly  from point to point, one moment blowing a hurricane, the next sinking to  a happy-go-lucky summer breeze. I have seen a little thing convert a  crew on the point of mutiny into a set of rollicking, good-natured souls  who--until the wind veered again--would not hurt a fly. So with these.  They spread themselves into a circle, squatting or kneeling or standing  upon the white sand in the bright sunshine, their sinewy hands that  should have been ingrained red clasped over their knees, or, arms  akimbo, resting upon their hips, on their scoundrel faces a broad smile,  and in their eyes that had looked on nameless horrors a pleasurable  expectation as of spectators in a playhouse awaiting the entrance of the  players.    \"There is really no good reason why we should gratify your whim,\" said  Paradise, still amused. \"But it will serve to pass the time. We will  fight you, one by one.\"    \"And if I win?\"    He laughed. \"Then, on the honor of a gentleman, you are Kirby and our  captain. If you lose, we will leave you where you stand for the gulls to  bury.\"    \"A bargain,\" I said, and drew my sword.    \"I first!\" roared Red Gil. \"God's wounds! there will need no second!\"    As he spoke he swung his cutlass and made an arc of blue flame. The  weapon became in his hands a flail, terrible to look upon, making  lightnings and whistling in the air, but in reality not so deadly as it  seemed. The fury of his onslaught would have beaten down the guard of  any mere swordsman, but that I was not. A man, knowing his weakness and  insufficiency in many and many a thing, may yet know his strength in one  or two and his modesty take no hurt. I was ever master of my sword, and  it did the thing I would have it do. Moreover, as I fought I saw her as  I had last seen her, standing against the bank of sand, her dark hair,  half braided, drawn over her bosom and hanging to her knees. Her eyes  haunted me, and my lips yet felt the touch of her hand. I fought  well,--how well the lapsing of oaths and laughter into breathless  silence bore witness.    The ruffian against whom I was pitted began to draw his breath in gasps.  He was a scoundrel not fit to die, less fit to live, unworthy of a  gentleman's steel. I presently ran him through with as little  compunction and as great a desire to be quit of a dirty job as if he had  been a mad dog. He fell, and a little later, while I was engaged with  the Spaniard, his soul went to that hell which had long gaped for it. To  those his companions his death was as slight a thing as would theirs  have been to him. In the eyes of the two remaining would-be leaders he  was a stumbling-block removed, and to the squatting, open-mouthed  commonalty his taking off weighed not a feather against the solid  entertainment I was affording them. I was now a better man than Red  Gil,--that was all.    The Spaniard was a more formidable antagonist. The best blade of Lima  was by no means to be despised: but Lima is a small place, and its  blades can be numbered. The sword that for three years had been counted  the best in all the Low Countries was its better. But I fought fasting  and for the second time that morning, so maybe the odds were not so  great. I wounded him slightly, and presently succeeded in disarming him.  \"Am I Kirby?\" I demanded, with my point at his breast.    \"Kirby, of course, senor,\" he answered with a sour smile, his eyes upon  the gleaming blade.    I lowered my point and we bowed to each other, after which he sat down  upon the sand and applied himself to stanching the bleeding from his  wound. The pirate ring gave him no attention, but stared at me instead.  I was now a better man than the Spaniard.    The man in black and silver rose and removed his doublet, folding it  very carefully, inside out, that the sand might not injure the velvet,  then drew his rapier, looked at it lovingly, made it bend until point  and hilt well-nigh met, and faced me with a bow.    \"You have fought twice, and must be weary,\" he said. \"Will you not take  breath before we engage, or will your long rest afterward suffice you?\"    \"I will rest aboard my ship,\" I made reply. \"And as I am in a hurry to  be gone we won't delay.\"    Our blades had no sooner crossed than I knew that in this last encounter  I should need every whit of my skill, all my wit, audacity, and  strength. I had met my equal, and he came to it fresh and I jaded. I  clenched my teeth and prayed with all my heart; I set her face before  me, and thought if I should fail her to what ghastly fate she might  come, and I fought as I had never fought before. The sound of the surf  became a roar in my ears, the sunshine an intolerable blaze of light;  the blue above and around seemed suddenly beneath my feet as well. We  were fighting high in the air, and had fought thus for ages. I knew that  he made no thrust I did not parry, no feint I could not interpret. I  knew that my eye was more quick to see, my brain to conceive, and my  hand to execute than ever before; but it was as though I held that  knowledge of some other, and I myself was far away, at Weyanoke, in the  minister's garden, in the haunted wood, anywhere save on that barren  islet. I heard him swear under his breath, and in the face I had set  before me the eyes brightened. As if she had loved me I fought for her  with all my powers of body and mind. He swore again, and my heart  laughed within me. The sea now roared less loudly, and I felt the good  earth beneath my feet. Slowly but surely I wore him out. His breath came  short, the sweat stood upon his forehead, and still I deferred my  attack. He made the thrust of a boy of fifteen, and I smiled as I put it  by.    \"Why don't you end it?\" he breathed. \"Finish and be hanged to you!\"    For answer I sent his sword flying over the nearest hillock of sand. \"Am  I Kirby?\" I said. He fell back against the heaped-up sand and leaned  there, panting, with his hand to his side. \"Kirby or devil,\" he replied.  \"Have it your own way.\"    I turned to the now highly excited rabble. \"Shove the boats off, half a  dozen of you!\" I ordered. \"Some of you others take up that carrion there  and throw it into the sea. The gold upon it is for your pains. You there  with the wounded shoulder you have no great hurt. I'll salve it with ten  pieces of eight from the captain's own share, the next prize we take.\"    A shout of acclamation arose that scared the sea fowl. They who so short  a time before had been ready to tear me limb from limb now with the  greatest apparent delight hailed me as captain. How soon they might  revert to their former mood was a question that I found not worth while  to propound to myself.    By this the man in black and silver had recovered his breath and his  equanimity. \"Have you no commission with which to honor me, noble  captain?\" he asked in gently reproachful tones. \"Have you forgot how  often you were wont to employ me in those sweet days when your eyes were  black?\"    \"By no means, Master Paradise,\" I said courteously. \"I desire your  company and that of the gentleman from Lima. You will go with me to  bring up the rest of my party. The three gentlemen of the broken head,  the bushy ruff, which I protest is vastly becoming, and the wounded  shoulder will escort us.\"    \"The rest of your party?\" said Paradise softly.    \"Ay,\" I answered nonchalantly. \"They are down the beach and around the  point warming themselves by a fire which this piled-up sand hides from  you. Despite the sunshine it is a biting air. Let us be going! This  island wearies me, and I am anxious to be on board ship and away.\"    \"So small an escort scarce befits so great a captain,\" he said. \"We will  all attend you.\" One and all started forward.    I called to mind and gave utterance to all the oaths I had heard in the  wars. \"I entertain you for my subordinate whom I command, and not who  commands me!\" I cried, when my memory failed me. \"As for you, you dogs,  who would question your captain and his doings, stay where you are, if  you would not be lessoned in earnest!\"    Sheer audacity is at times the surest steed a man can bestride. Now at  least it did me good service. With oaths and grunts of admiration the  pirates stayed where they were, and went about their business of  launching the boats and stripping the body of Red Gil, while the man in  black and silver, the Spaniard, the two gravediggers, the knave with the  wounded shoulder, and myself walked briskly up the beach.    With these five at my heels I strode up to the dying fire and to those  who had sprung to their feet at our approach. \"Sparrow,\" I said easily,  \"luck being with us as usual, I have fallen in with a party of rovers. I  have told them who I am,--that Kirby, to wit, whom an injurious world  calls the blackest pirate unhanged,--and I have recounted to them how  the great galleon which I took some months ago went down yesterday with  all on board, you and I with these others being the sole survivors. By  dint of a little persuasion they have elected me their captain, and we  will go on board directly and set sail for the Indies, a hunting ground  which we never should have left. You need not look so blank; you shall  be my mate and right hand still.\" I turned to the five who formed my  escort. \"This, gentlemen, is my mate, Jeremy Sparrow by name, who hath a  taste for divinity that in no wise interferes with his taste for a  galleon or a guarda costa. This man, Diccon Demon by name, was of my  crew. The gentleman without a sword is my prisoner, taken by me from the  last ship I sunk. How he, an Englishman, came"]]]
