[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1441"],[0,"The Story of an African Farm (#13)"],[1," matter?\" asked Em.    The room was in perfect darkness now.    \"Nothing,\" said Lyndall quietly; \"only they have locked us in.\"    She turned, and went back to bed again. But ere long Em heard a sound of  movement. Lyndall had climbed up into the window, and with her fingers  felt the woodwork that surrounded the panes. Slipping down, the girl  loosened the iron knob from the foot of the bedstead, and climbing up  again she broke with it every pane of glass in the window, beginning at  the top and ending at the bottom.    \"What are you doing?\" asked Em, who heard the falling fragments.    Her companion made her no reply; but leaned on every little cross-bar,  which cracked and gave way beneath her. Then she pressed with all her  strength against the shutter. She had thought the wooden buttons would  give way, but by the clinking sound she knew that the iron bar had been  put across. She was quite quiet for a time. Clambering down, she took  from the table a small one-bladed penknife, with which she began to peck  at the hard wood of the shutter.    \"What are you doing now?\" asked Em, who had ceased crying in her wonder,  and had drawn near.    \"Trying to make a hole,\" was the short reply.    \"Do you think you will be able to?\"    \"No; but I am trying.\"    In an agony of suspense Em waited. For ten minutes Lyndall pecked. The  hole was three-eighths of an inch deep--then the blade sprung into ten  pieces.    \"What has happened now?\" Em asked, blubbering afresh.    \"Nothing,\" said Lyndall. \"Bring me my nightgown, a piece of paper, and  the matches.\"    Wondering, Em fumbled about till she found them.    \"What are you going to do with them?\" she whispered.    \"Burn down the window.\"    \"But won't the whole house take fire and burn down too?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"But will it not be very wicked?\"    \"Yes, very. And I do not care.\"    She arranged the nightgown carefully in the corner of the window, with  the chips of the frame about it. There was only one match in the box.  She drew it carefully along the wall. For a moment it burnt up blue, and  showed the tiny face with its glistening eyes. She held it carefully to  the paper. For an instant it burnt up brightly, then flickered and went  out. She blew the spark, but it died also. Then she threw the paper on  to the ground, trod on it, and went to her bed, and began to undress.    Em rushed to the door, knocking against it wildly.    \"Oh, Tant Sannie! Tant Sannie! Oh, let us out!\" she cried. \"Oh, Lyndall,  what are we to do?\"    Lyndall wiped a drop of blood off the lip she had bitten.    \"I am going to sleep,\" she said. \"If you like to sit there and howl till  the morning, do. Perhaps you will find that it helps; I never heard that  howling helped any one.\"    Long after, when Em herself had gone to bed and was almost asleep,  Lyndall came and stood at her bedside.    \"Here,\" she said, slipping a little pot of powder into her hand; \"rub  some on to your face. Does it not burn where she struck you?\"    Then she crept back to her own bed. Long, long after, when Em was really  asleep, she lay still awake, and folded her hands on her little breast,  and muttered--    \"When that day comes, and I am strong, I will hate everything that has  power, and help everything that is weak.\" And she bit her lip again.    The German looked out at the cabin door for the last time that night.  Then he paced the room slowly and sighed. Then he drew out pen and  paper, and sat down to write, rubbing his old grey eyes with his  knuckles before he began.    \"My Chickens: You did not come to say good-bye to the old man. Might  you? Ah, well, there is a land where they part no more, where saints  immortal reign.    \"I sit here alone, and I think of you. Will you forget the old man? When  you wake tomorrow he will be far away. The old horse is lazy, but he has  his stick to help him; that is three legs. He comes back one day with  gold and diamonds. Will you welcome him? Well, we shall see. I go to  meet Waldo. He comes back with the wagon; then he follows me. Poor boy?  God knows. There is a land where all things are made right, but that  land is not here.    \"My little children, serve the Saviour; give your hearts to Him while  you are yet young. Life is short.    \"Nothing is mine, otherwise I would say, Lyndall, take my books, Em my  stones. Now I say nothing. The things are mine: it is not righteous, God  knows? But I am silent. Let it be. But I feel it, I must say I feel it.    \"Do not cry too much for the old man. He goes out to seek his fortune,  and comes back with it in a bag, it may be.    \"I love my children. Do they think of me? I am Old Otto, who goes out to  seek his fortune.    \"O.F.\"    Having concluded this quaint production, he put it where the children  would find it the next morning, and proceeded to prepare his bundle. He  never thought of entering a protest against the loss of his goods; like  a child, he submitted, and wept. He had been there eleven years, and it  was hard to go away. He spread open on the bed a blue handkerchief,  and on it put one by one the things he thought most necessary and  important--a little bag of curious seeds, which he meant to plant some  day, an old German hymn-book, three misshapen stones that he greatly  valued, a Bible, a shirt and two handkerchiefs; then there was room for  nothing more. He tied up the bundle tightly and put it on a chair by his  bedside.    \"That is not much; they cannot say I take much,\" he said, looking at it.    He put his knotted stick beside it, his blue tobacco bag and his short  pipe, and then inspected his coats. He had two left--a moth-eaten  overcoat and a black alpaca, out at the elbows. He decided for the  overcoat; it was warm, certainly, but then he could carry it over his  arm and only put it on when he met some one along the road. It was more  respectable than the black alpaca.    He hung the greatcoat over the back of the chair, and stuffed a hard bit  of roaster-cake under the knot of the bundle, and then his preparations  were completed. The German stood contemplating them with much  satisfaction. He had almost forgotten his sorrow at leaving in his  pleasure at preparing. Suddenly he started; an expression of intense  pain passed over his face. He drew back his left arm quickly, and then  pressed his right hand upon his breast.    \"Ah, the sudden pang again,\" he said.    His face was white, but it quickly regained its colour. Then the old man  busied himself in putting everything right.    \"I will leave it neat. They shall not say I did not leave it neat,\" he  said. Even the little bags of seeds on the mantelpiece he put in rows  and dusted. Then he undressed and got into bed. Under his pillow was  a little storybook. He drew it forth. To the old German a story was  no story. Its events were as real and as important to himself as the  matters of his own life.    He could not go away without knowing whether that wicked earl relented  and whether the baron married Emilina. So he adjusted his spectacles and  began to read. Occasionally, as his feelings became too strongly moved,  he ejaculated: \"Ah, I thought so! That was a rogue! I saw it before! I  knew it from the beginning!\" More than half an hour had passed when he  looked up to the silver watch at the top of his bed.    \"The march is long tomorrow; this will not do,\" he said, taking off his  spectacles and putting them carefully into the book to mark the place.  \"This will be good reading as I walk along tomorrow,\" he added, as he  stuffed the book into the pocket of the greatcoat; \"very good reading.\"  He nodded his head and lay down. He thought a little of his own  troubles, a good deal of the two little girls he was leaving, of the  earl, of Emilina, of the baron; but he was soon asleep--sleeping as  peacefully as a little child, upon whose innocent soul sorrow and care  cannot rest.    It was very quiet in the room. The coals in the fireplace threw a dull  red light across the floor upon the red lions on the quilt. Eleven  o'clock came, and the room was very still.    One o'clock came. The glimmer had died out, though the ashes were still  warm, and the room was very dark. The grey mouse, who had his hole under  the toolbox, came out and sat on the sacks in the corner; then, growing  bolder, the room was so dark, it climbed the chair at the bedside,  nibbled at the roaster-cake, took one bite quickly at the candle, and  then sat on his haunches listening. It heard the even breathing of the  old man, and the steps of the hungry Kaffer dog going his last round  in search of a bone or a skin that had been forgotten; and it heard the  white hen call out as the wild cat ran away with one of her brood, and  it heard the chicken cry. Then the grey mouse went back to its hole  under the toolbox, and the room was quiet. And two o'clock came. By that  time the night was grown dull and cloudy. The wild cat had gone to its  home on the kopje; the Kaffer dog had found a bone, and lay gnawing it.    An intense quiet reigned everywhere. Only in her room the Boer-woman  tossed her great arms in her sleep; for she dreamed that a dark shadow  with outstretched wings fled slowly over her house, and she moaned and  shivered. And the night was very still.    But, quiet as all places were, there was a quite peculiar quiet in the  German's room. Though you strained your ear most carefully you caught no  sound of breathing.    He was not gone, for the old coat still hung on the chair--the coat  that was to be put on when he met any one; and the bundle and stick were  ready for tomorrow's long march. The old German himself lay there, his  wavy black hair just touched with grey thrown back upon the pillow.  The old face was lying there alone in the dark, smiling like a little  child's--oh, so peacefully. There is a stranger whose coming, they say,  is worse than all the ills of life, from whose presence we flee away  trembling; but he comes very tenderly sometimes. And "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14417"],[0,"The Agamemnon of Aeschylus (#13)"],[1,"lyrics Cassandra has been  \"possessed\" or \"entranced\": the turn to dialogue marks a conscious attempt  to control herself and state plainly her message of warning. In order to  prove her power, she first tells the Elders of deeds done in the past  which are known to them but cannot have been known to her. When once they  are convinced of her true seercraft, she will be able to warn them of what  is coming!--The short 'stichom[^y]thia'[**TR: This is a y with a  circumflex, not a superscript.] (line for line dialogue), dealing in awed  whispers with things which can hardly be spoken, leaves the story of  Cassandra still a mystery. Then her self-control breaks and the power of  the God sweeps irresistibly upon her; cf. below, ll. 1256 ff.; where it  comes at her like a visible shape of fire, a thing not uncommon with  modern clairvoyants.

P. 60, ll. 1343 ff., The death cry; the hesitation of the Elders.]--This  scene is often condemned or even ridiculed; I think, through  misunderstanding. We knew the Old Men were helpless, like \"dreams  wandering in the day.\" It is essential to the story that when the crisis  comes they shall be found wanting. But they are neither foolish nor  cowardly; each utterance in itself is natural and characteristic, but  counsels are divided. One would like to know whether Aeschylus made them  speak together confusedly, as would certainly be done on the modern stage,  or whether the stately conventions of Greek tragedy preferred that each  speaker should finish his say. In any case, what happens is that after a  moment or two of confused counsel the Elders determine to break into the  Palace, but as they are mounting the steps the great doors are flung open  and Clytemnestra confronts them, standing over the dead bodies of  Agamemnon and Cassandra.    The illusion intended is that the Elders have entered the Palace and  discovered Clytemnestra. But, as the mechanical arrangements of the Greek  stage were not equal to this sudden change of scene, and since also it  would, even with perfect machinery, have a tiresome interrupting effect, a  slight confusion or inconsistency is allowed. We are supposed to be inside  the house; but as a matter of fact the supposition is soon forgotten, and  the play goes on without any attention to the particular place of the  action. On Clytemnestra's speech see Introduction, p. xiii.    P. 63, l. 1387, A prayer well sped to Zeus of Hell]--As the third gift or  libation was ritually given to Zeus the Saviour, Clytemnestra  blasphemously suggests that her third and unnecessary blow was an  acceptable gift to a sort of anti-Zeus, a Saviour of Death.

Ancient dramas  come down to us with no stage directions and very imperfect indications of  the speakers.    P, 72, l. 1579, AIGISTHOS.]--The entry of Aigisthos enlivens the scene  again after the brooding and bewildered end of the dialogue between  Clytemnestra and the Elders. At the same time, it seems, no doubt by  deliberate intention, to reduce it to commonplace. Aigisthos' self-defence  is largely justified, but he is no hero.
