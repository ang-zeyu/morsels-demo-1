[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/172"],[0,"The Haunted Bookshop (#13)"],[1,"that evening, and set out to walk homeward.  Without making a  very conscious choice, he felt instinctively that it would be agreeable  to walk back to Manhattan rather than permit the roaring disillusion of  the subway to break in upon his meditations.    It is to be feared that Aubrey would have badly flunked any quizzing on  the chapters of Somebody's Luggage which the bookseller had read aloud.  His mind was swimming rapidly in the agreeable, unfettered fashion of a  stream rippling downhill.  As O. Henry puts it in one of his most  delightful stories:  \"He was outwardly decent and managed to preserve  his aquarium, but inside he was impromptu and full of unexpectedness.\"  To say that he was thinking of Miss Chapman would imply too much power  of ratiocination and abstract scrutiny on his part.  He was not  thinking:  he was being thought.  Down the accustomed channels of his  intellect he felt his mind ebbing with the irresistible movement of  tides drawn by the blandishing moon.  And across these shimmering  estuaries of impulse his will, a lost and naked athlete, was painfully  attempting to swim, but making much leeway and already almost resigned  to being carried out to sea.    He stopped a moment at Weintraub's drug store, on the corner of Gissing  Street and Wordsworth Avenue, to buy some cigarettes, unfailing solace  of an agitated bosom.    It was the usual old-fashioned pharmacy of those parts of Brooklyn:  tall red, green, and blue vases of liquid in the windows threw blotches  of coloured light onto the pavement; on the panes was affixed white  china lettering:  H. WE TRAUB, DEUT CHE APOTHEKER.  Inside, the  customary shelves of labelled jars, glass cases holding cigars,  nostrums and toilet knick-knacks, and in one corner an ancient  revolving bookcase deposited long ago by the Tabard Inn Library.  The  shop was empty, but as he opened the door a bell buzzed sharply.  In a  back chamber he could hear voices.  As he waited idly for the druggist  to appear, Aubrey cast a tolerant eye over the dusty volumes in the  twirling case.  There were the usual copies of Harold MacGrath's The  Man on the Box, A Girl of the Limberlost, and The Houseboat on the  Styx.  The Divine Fire, much grimed, leaned against Joe Chapple's Heart  Throbs.  Those familiar with the Tabard Inn bookcases still to be found  in outlying drug-shops know that the stock has not been \"turned\" for  many a year.  Aubrey was the more surprised, on spinning the the case  round, to find wedged in between two other volumes the empty cover of a  book that had been torn loose from the pages to which it belonged.  He  glanced at the lettering on the back.  It ran thus:                                   CARLYLE                                ----                          OLIVER CROMWELL'S                               LETTERS                                 AND                              SPEECHES    Obeying a sudden impulse, he slipped the book cover in his overcoat  pocket.    Mr. Weintraub entered the shop, a solid Teutonic person with  discoloured pouches under his eyes and a face that was a potent  argument for prohibition.  His manner, however, was that of one anxious  to please.  Aubrey indicated the brand of cigarettes he wanted.  Having  himself coined the advertising catchword for them--They're mild--but  they satisfy--he felt a certain loyal compulsion always to smoke this  kind.  The druggist held out the packet, and Aubrey noticed that his  fingers were stained a deep saffron colour.    \"I see you're a cigarette smoker, too,\" said Aubrey pleasantly, as he  opened the packet and lit one of the paper tubes at a little alcohol  flame burning in a globe of blue glass on the counter.    \"Me?  I never smoke,\" said Mr. Weintraub, with a smile which somehow  did not seem to fit his surly face.  \"I must have steady nerves in my  profession.  Apothecaries who smoke make up bad prescriptions.\"    \"Well, how do you get your hands stained that way?\"    Mr. Weintraub removed his hands from the counter.    \"Chemicals,\" he grunted.  \"Prescriptions--all that sort of thing.\"    \"Well,\" said Aubrey, \"smoking's a bad habit.  I guess I do too much of  it.\"  He could not resist the impression that someone was listening to  their talk.  The doorway at the back of the shop was veiled by a  portiere of beads and thin bamboo sections threaded on strings.  He  heard them clicking as though they had been momentarily pulled aside.  Turning, just as he opened the door to leave, he noticed the bamboo  curtain swaying.    \"Well, good-night,\" he said, and stepped out onto the street.    As he walked down Wordsworth Avenue, under the thunder of the L, past  lighted lunchrooms, oyster saloons, and pawnshops, Miss Chapman resumed  her sway.  With the delightful velocity of thought his mind whirled in  a narrowing spiral round the experience of the evening.  The small  book-crammed sitting room of the Mifflins, the sparkling fire, the  lively chirrup of the bookseller reading aloud--and there, in the old  easy chair whose horsehair stuffing was bulging out, that blue-eyed  vision of careless girlhood!  Happily he had been so seated that he  could study her without seeming to do so.  The line of her ankle where  the firelight danced upon it put Coles Phillips to shame, he averred.  Extraordinary, how these creatures are made to torment us with their  intolerable comeliness!  Against the background of dusky bindings her  head shone with a soft haze of gold.  Her face, that had an air of  naive and provoking independence, made him angry with its unnecessary  surplus of enchantment.  An unaccountable gust of rage drove him  rapidly along the frozen street.  \"Damn it,\" he cried, \"what right has  any girl to be as pretty as that?  Why--why, I'd like to beat her!\" he  muttered, amazed at himself.  \"What the devil right has a girl got to  look so innocently adorable?\"    It would be unseemly to follow poor Aubrey in his vacillations of rage  and worship as he thrashed along Wordsworth Avenue, hearing and seeing  no more than was necessary for the preservation of his life at street  crossings.  Half-smoked cigarette stubs glowed in his wake;[2] his  burly bosom echoed with incoherent oratory.  In the darker stretches of  Fulton Street that lead up to the Brooklyn Bridge he fiercely  exclaimed:  \"By God, it's not such a bad world.\" As he ascended the  slope of that vast airy span, a black midget against a froth of stars,  he was gravely planning such vehemence of exploit in the advertising  profession as would make it seem less absurd to approach the President  of the Daintybits Corporation with a question for which no progenitor  of loveliness is ever quite prepared.      [2] NOTE WHILE PROOFREADING:  Surely this phrase was unconsciously  lifted from R. L. S. But where does the original occur?  C. D. M.    In the exact centre of the bridge something diluted his mood; he  halted, leaning against the railing, to consider the splendour of the  scene.  The hour was late--moving on toward midnight--but in the tall  black precipices of Manhattan scattered lights gleamed, in an odd,  irregular pattern like the sparse punctures on the raffle-board--\"take  a chance on a Milk-Fed Turkey\"--the East Indian elevator-boy presents  to apartment-house tenants about Hallowe'en.  A fume of golden light  eddied over uptown merriment:  he could see the ruby beacon on the  Metropolitan Tower signal three quarters.  Underneath the airy decking  of the bridge a tug went puffing by, her port and starboard lamps  trailing red and green threads over the tideway.  Some great argosy of  the Staten Island fleet swept serenely down to St. George, past Liberty  in her soft robe of light, carrying theatred commuters, dazed with  weariness and blinking at the raw fury of the electric bulbs.  Overhead  the night was a superb arch of clear frost, sifted with stars.  Blue  sparks crackled stickily along the trolley wires as the cars groaned  over the bridge.    Aubrey surveyed all this splendid scene without exact observation.  He  was of a philosophic turn, and was attempting to console his  discomfiture in the overwhelming lustre of Miss Titania by the thought  that she was, after all, the creature and offspring of the science he  worshipped--that of Advertising.  Was not the fragrance of her  presence, the soft compulsion of her gaze, even the delirious frill of  muslin at her wrist, to be set down to the credit of his chosen art?  Had he not, pondering obscurely upon \"attention-compelling\" copy and  lay-out and type-face, in a corner of the Grey-Matter office,  contributed to the triumphant prosperity and grace of this unconscious  beneficiary?  Indeed she seemed to him, fiercely tormenting himself  with her loveliness, a symbol of the mysterious and subtle power of  publicity.  It was Advertising that had done this--that had enabled Mr.  Chapman, a shy and droll little person, to surround this girl with all  the fructifying glories of civilization--to foster and cherish her  until she shone upon the earth like a morning star!  Advertising had  clothed her, Advertising had fed her, schooled, roofed, and sheltered  her.  In a sense she was the crowning advertisement of her father's  career, and her innocent perfection taunted him just as much as the  bright sky-sign he knew was flashing the words CHAPMAN PRUNES above the  teeming pavements of Times Square.  He groaned to think that he  himself, by his conscientious labours, had helped to put this girl in  such a position that he could hardly dare approach her.    He would never have approached her again, on any pretext, if the  intensity of his thoughts had not caused him, unconsciously, to grip  the railing of the bridge with strong and angry hands.  For at that  moment a sack was thrown over his head from behind and he was violently  seized by the legs, with the obvious intent of hoisting him over the  parapet.  His unexpected grip on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17211"],[0,"A School History of the Great War (#13)"],[1,"force which captured and occupied the German islands in  the North Pacific. Kiaochow (kyou'ch[=o]'), Germany's only colony in China,  was captured by a combined Japanese and British force early in November.    The loss of these colonies so early in the war interfered seriously with  German plans for a war on Allied commerce by fast cruisers. In the  absence of German coaling stations, the only way such vessels could  obtain coal during a long raiding voyage, would be by the chance capture  of coal-laden vessels.    GERMAN COLONIES IN AFRICA.--During the last quarter century Germany  had succeeded in getting control of considerable territory in Africa.  There were few German colonists there. However, Germany hoped that the  Boers, who had recently fought a war with the British, and had been  defeated, would attempt to regain their independence. In this case there  was also the possibility of capturing Cape Colony and Rhodesia from the  British. Much to the surprise and disgust of Germany, the Boers promptly  showed their loyalty to Great Britain and aided in capturing the German  colonies.    The struggle for Germany's African colonies continued for more than  three years. Togo, a comparatively small colony, was captured by French  and British troops shortly after the outbreak of the war. Under the Boer  leaders, Generals Smuts and Botha, German Southwest Africa was conquered  by July of 1915. Kamerun in West Africa was freed from German forces in  1916. The final chapter in the fight for the German colonies was written  in December of 1917, when an army from British South Africa, in  cooeperation with Belgian forces, completed the conquest of German East  Africa.    GERMANY'S FLEET.--When war was declared the German fleet, which had  cost the people of Germany a billion and a half of dollars, was  something less than two thirds the strength of the British fleet.  Germany's task was to destroy the British fleet or to weaken it to such  an extent that it could no longer protect the British trade in food and  munitions from over seas, nor assure the safe transport of troops from  Great Britain or her colonies to the various fronts.    THE WORK OF THE BRITISH NAVY.--The British navy had two pieces of work  to perform. In the first place its aim was to destroy or bottle up in  port the main German fleet so that it should not be able to interfere  with the British plans for the war. In the second place squadrons had to  be sent out to search for and destroy German squadrons or vessels that  were far from home ports at the outbreak of war or that were sent out to  raid British and neutral commerce.    COAST PROTECTION.--Both Great Britain and Germany protected their  coasts by laying fields of mines in the sea so placed that they would  float just under water and arranged to explode on contact with the hull  of a ship. Through these mine fields carefully hidden channels gave  access to the different ports. So long as ships stayed in port or  inside the fields of mines they were safe from attack.    THE BLOCKADE OF GERMAN PORTS.--In July, 1914, the British navy had a  grand review. When the review was over, the war clouds were so  threatening that the vessels were not dismissed to their stations. At  the beginning of the war Great Britain announced a blockade of German  ports and assigned to her main fleet the task of carrying out the  blockade.    THE BATTLE OF HELGOLAND BIGHT.--Hel'goland is a small island rising  steeply out of the North Sea; it has an area of one fifth of a square  mile. It was ceded to Germany by England about twenty years before the  war. Germany had fortified it and made it a sort of German Gibraltar to  protect her chief naval ports. The Bight of Helgoland is the passage  about eighteen miles wide between the island and the German coast. Here  a portion of the British fleet engaged in patrol or scout duty came in  contact with a part of the German fleet (August 28, 1914). The arrival  of four fast British battleships decided the contest. Germany lost three  cruisers and two destroyers, while every British vessel returned to  port, though some were badly battered.    GERMAN COMMERCE RAIDERS.--A few days before the outbreak of the war  the German fleet in China slipped out of port. The cruiser \"Emden\" was  detached for work in the Indian Ocean, and the rest of the squadron  raided over the Pacific. November 1, a British squadron met the German  ships near the coast of Chile. In a little over an hour two of the  British ships had been sunk and the remainder fled to the south.  Immediately on news of the defeat the British Admiralty sent a squadron  of seven powerful ships to find and destroy the German squadron. The  British vessels stopped at the Falkland Islands to coal. The next day  the German ships appeared. When they saw the strength of the British  squadron they vainly attempted to escape. In the battle that followed,  four German vessels were sunk. Of the two that escaped one was, a few  months later, interned in a United States port and about the same time  the other was destroyed.    The \"Emden,\" after separating from the other warships, cruised in the  Indian Ocean for three months, and was the most destructive of the  German raiders. She was finally located by an Australian cruiser. After  a fight the German captain drove his vessel on the rocks to escape  sinking. A lieutenant and forty men who had landed to destroy a wireless  station, seized a schooner and escaped, landed on the coast of Arabia,  and finally made their way back to Germany.    NAVAL SITUATION AT THE CLOSE OF 1914.--As a result of the activities  of the Allied fleets, the German navy was shut up in port back of its  mine fields, German commerce raiders had, with a few exceptions, been  driven from the sea or destroyed, German merchant vessels were laid up  in neutral or German ports, and the Allies were free to carry on the  transport of troops, munitions, and other supplies with practically no  fear of interference from the enemy. \"The British ships, whether  men-of-war or merchantmen, are upon the sea, the German in their ports.\"        SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY.--1. Locate Metz, Cologne, Liege,      Namur, Lille, Verdun; the Meuse, the Marne, the Oise, the      Aisne; Lemberg, Warsaw, Koenigsberg. 2. Look at a large map of      Europe and by reference to the scale find out the following      distances: Metz to Paris; Cologne to Paris (via Liege);      Verdun to Berlin; Verdun to Strassburg; Liege to Paris;      Warsaw to Berlin. What is the length of the Belgian      coast-line; of the Dutch coast-line; of the Franco-German      frontier? 3. Collect pictures and charts illustrative of      trench warfare, and of devastated areas of Belgium and      France. 4. Explain fully the influence of geography upon the      campaigns of 1914. 5. Define neutrality; guarantee; treaty.      6. On an outline map of Europe indicate the countries      fighting against Germany at the close of 1914. Indicate those      fighting on the side of Germany at that time. Indicate the      date when each of these countries entered the war. Draw a      line showing the farthest German advance into France, and the      farthest Russian advance into Germany and Austria (map, page      124). 7. What might have been the consequences if the      Belgians had not resisted the German invasion? 8. Describe      the German effort to reach the French coast in 1914. What      would have been the probable consequences of its success? 9.      What was the purpose of the English blockade of Germany? How      did this blockade affect the rights of neutrals? Find out      what the United States government did in the matter.

CHAPTER IX    THE WAR IN 1915      THE WESTERN FRONT.--The deadlock which existed on the western front at  the close of 1914 continued with little change during the year 1915.  There were indeed many contests which, on account of the men involved  and the casualties, would in previous wars have been considered major  engagements; but in spite of great preparations neither side was able to  make much impression upon the entrenched line of the enemy. From the sea  to the Swiss border two apparently impregnable lines of trenches faced  each other.    German ingenuity and barbarity were shown in two new forms of warfare  introduced during this year. Poison gas was first used, contrary to the  terms of the Hague Conventions, against the Allied line on April 22,  1915. It brought on the most horrible forms of suffering and torture,  and compelled a temporary withdrawal of the French and English from  trenches near Ypres (eepr). Later, masks were used as a preventive of  gas poisoning. Eventually the Allies were forced to adopt the use of  poisonous gases in bombs and shells in order to fight the Germans with  their own weapon. The other innovation was the \"flame-thrower,\" an  apparatus which threw a flame of burning liquid or gas far ahead of the  troops. This has never been widely used by the Germans, because it  proved almost as dangerous to themselves as it was to their opponents. A  sharpshooter's bullet or a piece of shell might pierce the apparatus and  the containers and produce dangerous results among the Germans.    THE GALLIPOLI CAMPAIGN.--In the east the year opened with an attempt  on the part of the Allies to force the Dardanelles with their fleets and  take possession of the city of Constantinople. The campaign gets its  name from the peninsula of Gallip'oli, the European shore of the  Dardanelles. In February the campaign opened with a naval attack. The  Turkish "]]]
