Bergson says:         The unconscious is our historical past. In reality the past is       preserved automatically. In its entirety probably it follows us       at every instant; all that we have felt, thought and willed from       our earliest infancy is there, leaning over the present which is       about to join it, pressing against the portals of consciousness       that would fain leave it outside.    =Spontaneous Outbursts.= \"How do we know all this?\" some one says.  \"What is the evidence for these sweeping statements? If we cannot  remember, how can we discover these strange memories that are so  powerful but so elusive? If they are below the level of consciousness,  are they not, in the very nature of the case, forever hidden from  view, in the sphere of the occult rather than that of science?\"    The answer to these questions is determined by one important fact; the  line between the conscious and subconscious minds does not always  remain in the same place; the \"threshold of consciousness\" is  sometimes displaced, automatically allowing these buried memories to  come to the surface. In sleep and delirium, in trance and  hallucination, in hysteria and intoxication, the tables are turned;  the restraining hand of the conscious mind is loosened and the  submerged self comes forth with all its ancient memories.    It is a common experience to have a patient in delirium repeat  long-forgotten verses or descriptions of events that the \"real man\"  has lost entirely. The renowned servant-girl, quoted by Hudson, who in  delirium recited passage after passage of Hebrew, Latin, and Greek,  which she had heard her one-time master repeat in his study, is  typical of many such instances.[20]    [Footnote 20: Hudson: _The Law of Psychic Phenomena_, p. 44. Quoted  from _Coleridge's Biographia Literaria_, Vol. I, p. 117 (edit. 1847).]    A young girl of nineteen, a patient of mine, lapsed for several weeks  into a dissociated state in which she forgot all the memories and  ideas of her adult life, and returned to the period of her childhood.  She used to say that she saw things inside her head and would  accurately describe events that took place before she was two years of  age,--scenes which she had completely forgotten in her normal life.  One day when I asked her to tell me what she was seeing, she began to  talk about \"little sister\" (herself) and \"little brother.\" \"Little  sister and brother were the two little folks that lived with their  mother and their daddy and they were playing on the sand-pile. You  know there was only one sand-pile, not like all the ones they have  down here (at the seaside), and they had a bucket that they would put  sand in and they would dump it out again and they would make nice  things, you know; they would play with their little dog Ponto and he  was white with black and brown spots on him. Little brother had white  hair and he was bigger than little sister and he had a little waist  with ruffles down the front and around the collar and a black coat  that came down to his knees and it had two little white bands around  it. Some of the waists he wore had blue specks and some had red and  black specks in it.    \"Little sister had yellow curls and she had a blue coat with jiggly  streaks of white in it, and she had a little white bonnet that was  crocheted, and she had little blue mittens on that were tied to a  string that went around her neck and down the other arm. It got pretty  cold where they lived. Little sister and little brother would go out  to the pile of leaves and jump on them and bounce and they would  crackle. The leaves came down from the trees all of a sudden when they  got tired, and they were different colors, brown and red. Little  sister could walk then but she could not walk one other time before  then; she could stand up by holding to a chair, but she could not go  herself. One morning Big Tom said 'Run to Daddy' and she went to her  daddy, and after that she always walked; they were glad and she was  glad. She walked all day long. Big Tom was a man who used to help  Daddy and little sister always liked him. He was a nice man.\"    The mother verified this scene of the first walking, saying that it  had occurred on her own wedding-anniversary when the child was  twenty-three months old.    One night I heard the same patient talk in her sleep in the slow and  hesitating manner of a child reading phonetically from a printed page.  I soon recognized the words as those of a poem of Tagore's, called \"My  Prayer,\" and remembered that a magazine containing the poem had been  lying on the bed during the day. When she had finished I wakened her,  saying, \"Now tell me what you have been dreaming.\" She answered in  her childish way, \"I think I do not dream.\" She went to sleep  immediately and again repeated the poem, word for word, without a  single mistake. Again I awakened her with the words, \"Now tell me what  you have been dreaming.\" And again she answered, \"I think I do not  dream.\" I said: \"But yes; don't you remember you were just saying,  'When the time comes for me to go'?\" (the last line of the poem). \"Oh,  yes,\" she said, \"I was seeing it, and I think I'll not go to sleep  again. It tires me so to see it.\"    While she was awake she had no recollection of having seen the poem  and was indeed in her dissociated state quite incapable of  understanding its meaning. Asleep, she saw every word as plainly as if  the page had been before her eyes.    The distorted pictures of dreams are always made of the material which  past experiences have furnished and which have in many cases been  dropped out of consciousness for years only to rise out of their long  oblivion when the conscious mind has been put to sleep.    =Unearthing Old Experiences.= However, psychology does not have to  wait for buried memories to come forth of their own free will. It has  a number of successful ways of summoning them from their hiding-place  and helping them across the line into consciousness. In the hands of  skilled investigators and therapeutists, hypnosis, hypnoidization,  automatic writing, crystal-gazing, abstraction, free association,  word-association, and interpretation of dreams have all been  repeatedly successful in bringing to light memories which apparently  have been for many years completely blotted out of mind. As we become  better acquainted with these technical devices we shall find that  there are four kinds of experiences whose records are carefully stored  away in our minds. Some were always so far from the center of our  attention that we could swear they never had been ours; others,  although once present in consciousness, were so trivial and  unimportant that it seems ridiculous to suppose them conserved; others  never came into our waking minds at all and entered our lives only in  special states, such as sleep or delirium or dreams. All these we  should expect to forget; the astonishing thing is that they ever were  conserved. But there is a fourth class that is different. It is made  up of experiences that were so vital, so emotional, so closely woven  into the fiber of our being that it seems impossible that they ever  could be forgotten. Let us look at a few examples of records of all  these four kinds of experiences, examples chosen from hundreds of  their kind as illustrations of the all-embracing character of buried  memories.[21]    [Footnote 21: For further examples see Prince, _The Unconscious_;  Prince, _The Dissociation of a Personality_, and Hudson, _The Law of  Psychic Phenomena_.]    =Out of the Corners of Our Eyes.= In the first place, we are much  more observing than we imagine. We may be so interested in our own  thoughts that details of our environment are entirely lost on the  conscious mind, but the subconscious has its eyes open, and its ears.  People in hypnosis have been known to repeat verbatim whole passages  from newspapers which they had never consciously read. While they were  busy with one column, their wide-awake subconscious was devouring the  next one, and remembering it. Prince relates the story of a young  woman who unconsciously \"took in\" the details of a friend's  appearance:         I asked B.C.A. (without warning and after having covered her       eyes) to describe the dress of a friend who was present and with       whom she had been conversing perhaps some twenty minutes. She was       unable to do so beyond saying that he wore dark clothes. I then       found that I myself was unable to give a more detailed       description of his dress, although we had lunched and been       together about two hours. B.C.A. was then asked to write a       description automatically. Her hand wrote as follows (she was       unaware that her hand was writing):         \"He has on a dark greenish gray suit, a stripe in it--little       rough stripe; black bow cravat; shirt with three little stripes       in it; black laced shoes; false teeth; one finger gone; three       buttons on his coat.\"         The written description was absolutely correct. The stripes in       the coat were almost invisible. I had not noticed       his teeth or the loss of a finger and we had to count the buttons       to make sure of their number owing to their partial concealment       by the folds of the unbuttoned coat. The shoe-strings I am sure       under the conditions would have escaped nearly every one's       notice.[22]    [Footnote 22: Prince: _The Unconscious_, p. 53.]    Automatic writing, the method used to uncover this subconscious  perception, is a favorite method with some investigators and is often  used by Morton Prince. The hand writes without the direction of the  personal consciousness and usually without the person's being aware  that it is writing. A dissociated person does this very easily; other  people can cultivate the ability, and perhaps most of us"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988"],[0,"Cicero's Tusculan Disputations (#13)"],[1,"the happiness of human nature; and this would neither have  produced nor provided for a being which, after having gone through the  labors of life, was to fall into eternal misery by death. Let us rather  infer that we have a retreat and haven prepared for us, which I wish we  could crowd all sail and arrive at; but though the winds should not  serve, and we should be driven back, yet we shall to a certainty arrive  at that point eventually, though somewhat later. But how can that be  miserable for one which all must of necessity undergo? I have given you  a peroration, that you might not think I had overlooked or neglected  anything.    _A._ I am persuaded you have not; and, indeed, that peroration has  confirmed me.    _M._ I am glad it has had that effect. But it is now time to consult  our health. To-morrow, and all the time we continue in this Tusculan  villa, let us consider this subject; and especially those portions of  it which may ease our pain, alleviate our fears, and lessen our  desires, which is the greatest advantage we can reap from the whole of  philosophy.           *       *       *       *       *          BOOK II.    ON BEARING PAIN.      I. Neoptolemus, in Ennius, indeed, says that the study of philosophy  was expedient for him; but that it required limiting to a few subjects,  for that to give himself up entirely to it was what he did not approve  of. And for my part, Brutus, I am perfectly persuaded that it is  expedient for me to philosophize; for what can I do better, especially  as I have no regular occupation? But I am not for limiting my  philosophy to a few subjects, as he does; for philosophy is a matter in  which it is difficult to acquire a little knowledge without acquainting  yourself with many, or all its branches, nor can you well take a few  subjects without selecting them out of a great number; nor can any one,  who has acquired the knowledge of a few points, avoid endeavoring with  the same eagerness to understand more. But still, in a busy life, and  in one mainly occupied with military matters, such as that of  Neoptolemus was at that time, even that limited degree of acquaintance  with philosophy may be of great use, and may yield fruit, not perhaps  so plentiful as a thorough knowledge of the whole of philosophy, but  yet such as in some degree may at times deliver us from the dominion of  our desires, our sorrows, and our fears; just as the effect of that  discussion which we lately maintained in my Tusculan villa seemed to be  that a great contempt of death was engendered, which contempt is of no  small efficacy towards delivering the mind from fear; for whoever  dreads what cannot be avoided can by no means live with a quiet and  tranquil mind. But he who is under no fear of death, not only because  it is a thing absolutely inevitable but also because he is persuaded  that death itself hath nothing terrible in it, provides himself with a  very great resource towards a happy life. However, I am not tolerant  that many will argue strenuously against us; and, indeed, that is a  thing which can never be avoided, except by abstaining from writing at  all. For if my Orations, which were addressed to the judgment and  approbation of the people (for that is a popular art, and the object of  oratory is popular applause), have been criticised by some people who  are inclined to withhold their praise from everything but what they are  persuaded they can attain to themselves, and who limit their ideas of  good speaking by the hopes which they conceive of what they themselves  may attain to, and who declare, when they are overwhelmed with a flow  of words and sentences, that they prefer the utmost poverty of thought  and expression to that plenty and copiousness (from which arose the  Attic kind of oratory, which they who professed it were strangers to,  though they have now been some time silenced, and laughed out of the  very courts of justice), what may I not expect, when at present I  cannot have the least countenance from the people by whom I used to be  upheld before? For philosophy is satisfied with a few judges, and of  her own accord industriously avoids the multitude, who are jealous of  it, and utterly displeased with it; so that, should any one undertake  to cry down the whole of it, he would have the people on his side;  while, if he should attack that school which I particularly profess, he  would have great assistance from those of the other philosophers.    II. But I have answered the detractors of philosophy in general, in my  Hortensius. And what I had to say in favor of the Academics, is, I  think, explained with sufficient accuracy in my four books of the  Academic Question.    But yet I am so far from desiring that no one should write against me,  that it is what I most earnestly wish; for philosophy would never have  been in such esteem in Greece itself, if it had not been for the  strength which it acquired from the contentions and disputations of the  most learned men; and therefore I recommend all men who have abilities  to follow my advice to snatch this art also from declining Greece, and  to transport it to this city; as our ancestors by their study and  industry have imported all their other arts which were worth having.  Thus the praise of oratory, raised from a low degree, is arrived at  such perfection that it must now decline, and, as is the nature of all  things, verge to its dissolution in a very short time. Let philosophy,  then, derive its birth in Latin language from this time, and let us  lend it our assistance, and bear patiently to be contradicted and  refuted; and although those men may dislike such treatment who are  bound and devoted to certain predetermined opinions, and are under such  obligations to maintain them that they are forced, for the sake of  consistency, to adhere to them even though they do not themselves  wholly approve of them; we, on the other hand, who pursue only  probabilities, and who cannot go beyond that which seems really likely,  can confute others without obstinacy, and are prepared to be confuted  ourselves without resentment. Besides, if these studies are ever  brought home to us, we shall not want even Greek libraries, in which  there is an infinite number of books, by reason of the multitude of  authors among them; for it is a common practice with many to repeat the  same things which have been written by others, which serves no purpose  but to stuff their shelves; and this will be our case, too, if many  apply themselves to this study.    III. But let us excite those, if possible, who have had a liberal  education, and are masters of an elegant style, and who philosophize  with reason and method.    For there is a certain class of them who would willingly be called  philosophers, whose books in our language are said to be numerous, and  which I do not despise; for, indeed, I never read them: but still,  because the authors themselves declare that they write without any  regularity, or method, or elegance, or ornament, I do not care to read  what must be so void of entertainment. There is no one in the least  acquainted with literature who does not know the style and sentiments  of that school; wherefore, since they are at no pains to express  themselves well, I do not see why they should be read by anybody except  by one another. Let them read them, if they please, who are of the same  opinions; for in the same manner as all men read Plato and the other  Socratics, with those who sprung from them, even those who do not agree  with their opinions, or are very indifferent about them; but scarcely  any one except their own disciples take Epicurus or Metrodorus into  their hands; so they alone read these Latin books who think that the  arguments contained in them are sound. But, in my opinion, whatever is  published should be recommended to the reading of every man of  learning; and though we may not succeed in this ourselves, yet  nevertheless we must be sensible that this ought to be the aim of every  writer. And on this account I have always been pleased with the custom  of the Peripatetics and Academics, of disputing on both sides of the  question; not solely from its being the only method of discovering what  is probable on every subject, but also because it affords the greatest  scope for practising eloquence; a method that Aristotle first made use  of, and afterward all the Aristotelians; and in our own memory Plilo,  whom we have often heard, appointed one time to treat of the precepts  of the rhetoricians, and another for philosophical discussion, to which  custom I was brought to conform by my friends at my Tusculum; and  accordingly our leisure time was spent in this manner. And therefore,  as yesterday before noon we applied ourselves to speaking, and in the  afternoon went down into the Academy, the discussions which were held  there I have acquainted you with, not in the manner of a narration, but  in almost the very same words which were employed in the debate.    IV. The discourse, then, was introduced in this manner while we were  walking, and it was commenced by some such an opening as this:    _A._ It is not to be expressed how much I was delighted, or rather  edified, by your discourse of yesterday. For although I am conscious to  myself that I have never been too fond of life, yet at times, when I  have considered that there would be an end to this life, and that I  must some time or other part with all its good things, a certain dread  and uneasiness used to intrude itself on my thoughts; but now, believe  me, I am so freed from that kind of uneasiness that there is nothing  that I think less worth any regard.    _M._ I am not at all surprised at that, for it is the effect of  philosophy, which is the medicine of our souls; it banishes all  groundless apprehensions, frees us from desires, and drives away fears:  but it has not the same influence over all men; it is of very"]]]
