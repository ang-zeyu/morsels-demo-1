And I am one who should know, for I have been long dwelling  in Hell, that is Hampton; and now am I escaped thence, and am minded  for the Burg, if perchance I may be deemed there a man good enough to  ride in their host, whereby I might avenge me somewhat on them that  have undone me: some of whom meseemeth must have put in thy mouth that  word against the Burg.  Is it not so?\"    \"Maybe,\" said Ralph, \"for thou seemest to be a true man.\" No more he  spake though he had half a mind to tell the carle all the tale of that  adventure; but something held him back when he thought of that lady and  her fairness.  Yet again his heart misgave him of what might betide  that other maiden at Hampton, and he was unquiet, deeming that he must  needs follow her thither.  The carle looked on him curiously and  somewhat anxiously, but Ralph's eyes were set on something that was not  there; or else maybe had he looked closely on the carle he might have  deemed that longing to avenge him whereof he spoke did not change his  face much; for in truth there was little wrath in it.    Now the carle said:  \"Thou hast a tale which thou deemest unmeet for my  ears, as it well may be.  Well, thou must speak, or refrain from  speaking, what thou wilt; but thou art so fair a young knight, and so  blithe with a poor man, and withal I deem that thou mayest help me to  some gain and good, that I will tell thee a true tale: and first that  the Burg is a good town under a good lord, who is no tyrant nor  oppressor of peaceful men; and that thou mayest dwell there in peace as  to the folk thereof, who be good folk, albeit they be no dastards to  let themselves be cowed by murder-carles.  And next I will tell thee  that the folk of the town of Hampton be verily as harmless and innocent  as sheep; but that they be under evil lords who are not their true  lords, who lay heavy burdens on them and torment them even to the  destroying of their lives: and lastly I will tell thee that I was one  of those poor people, though not so much a sheep as the more part of  them, therefore have these tyrants robbed me of my croft, and set  another man in my house; and me they would have slain had I not fled to  the wood that it might cover me.  And happy it was for me that I had  neither wife, nor chick, nor child, else had they done as they did with  my brother, whose wife was too fair for him, since he dwelt at Hampton;  so that they took her away from him to make sport for them of the Dry  Tree, who dwell in the Castle of the Scaur, who shall be thy masters if  thou goest thither.    \"This is my tale, and thine, I say, I ask not; but I deem that thou  shalt do ill if thou go not to the Burg either with me or by thyself  alone; either as a guest, or as a good knight to take service in their  host.\"    Now so it was that Ralph was wary; and this time he looked closely at  the carle, and found that he spake coldly for a man with so much wrath  in his heart; therefore he was in doubt about the thing; moreover he  called to mind the words of the lady whom he had delivered, and her  loveliness, and the kisses she had given him, and he was loth to find  her a liar; and he was loth also to think that the maiden of Bourton  had betaken her to so evil a dwelling.  So he said:    \"Friend, I know not that I must needs be a partaker in the strife  betwixt Hampton and the Burg, or go either to one or the other of these  strongholds.  Is there no other way out of this wood save by Hampton or  the Burg?  or no other place anigh, where I may rest in peace awhile,  and then go on mine own errands?\"    Said the Carle:  \"There is a thorp that lieth somewhat west of the  Burg, which is called Apthorp; but it is an open place, not fenced, and  is debateable ground, whiles held by them of the Burg, whiles by the  Dry Tree; and if thou tarry there, and they of the Dry Tree take thee,  soon is thine errand sped; and if they of the Burg take thee, then  shalt thou be led into the Burg in worse case than thou wouldest be if  thou go thereto uncompelled.  What sayest thou, therefore?  Who shall  hurt thee in the Burg, a town which is under good and strong law, if  thou be a true man, as thou seemest to be?  And if thou art seeking  adventures, as may well be, thou shalt soon find them there ready to  hand.  I rede thee come with me to the Burg; for, to say sooth, I shall  find it somewhat easier to enter therein if I be in the company of  thee, a knight and a lord.\"    So Ralph considered and thought that there lay indeed but little peril  to him in the Burg, whereas both those men with whom he had striven  were hushed for ever, and there was none else to tell the tale of the  battle, save the lady, whose peril from them of the Burg was much  greater than his; and also he thought that if anything untoward befel,  he had some one to fall back on in old Oliver:  yet on the other hand  he had a hankering after Hampton under Scaur, where, to say sooth, he  doubted not to see the lady again.    So betwixt one thing and the other, speech hung on his lips awhile,  when suddenly the carle said:  \"Hist! thou hast left thy horse without  the bushes, and he is whinnying\" (which indeed he was), \"there is now  no time to lose.  To horse straightway, for certainly there are folk at  hand, and they may be foemen, and are most like to be.\"    Therewith they both arose and hastened to where Falcon stood just  outside the alder bushes, and Ralph leapt a-horseback without more ado,  and the carle waited no bidding to leap up behind him, and pointing to  a glade of the wood which led toward the highway, cried out, \"Spur that  way, thither! they of the Dry Tree are abroad this morning.  Spur! 'tis  for life or death!\"    Ralph shook the rein and Falcon leapt away without waiting for the  spur, while the carle looked over his shoulder and said, \"Yonder they  come! they are three; and ever they ride well horsed.  Nay, nay!  They  are four,\" quoth he, as a shout sounded behind them.  \"Spur, young  lord! spur!  And thine horse is a mettlesome beast.  Yea, it will do,  it will do.\"    Therewith came to Ralph's ears the sound of their horse-hoofs beating  the turf, and he spurred indeed, and Falcon flew forth.    \"Ah,\" cried the carle! \"but take heed, for they see that thy horse is  good, and one of them, the last, hath a bent Turk bow in his hand, and  is laying an arrow on it; as ever their wont is to shoot a-horseback: a  turn of thy rein, as if thine horse were shying at a weasel on the  road!\"    Ralph stooped his head and made Falcon swerve, and heard therewith the  twang of the bowstring and straightway the shaft flew past his ears.  Falcon galloped on, and the carle cried out: \"There is the highway  toward the Burg!  Do thy best, do thy best!  Lo you again!\"    For the second shaft flew from the Turkish bow, and the noise of the  chase was loud behind them.  Once again twanged the bow-string, but  this time the arrow fell short, and the woodland man, turning himself  about as well as he might, shook his clenched fist at the chase, crying  out in a voice broken by the gallop: \"Ha, thieves!  I am Roger of the  Rope-walk, I go to twist a rope for the necks of you!\"    Then he spake to Ralph:  \"They are turning back:  they are beaten, and  withal they love not the open road:  yet slacken not yet, young knight,  unless thou lovest thine horse more than thy life; for they will follow  on through the thicket on the way-side to see whether thou wert born a  fool and hast learned nothing later.\"    \"Yea,\" said Ralph, \"and now I deem thou wilt tell me that to the Burg I  needs must.\"    \"Yea, forsooth,\" said the carle, \"nor shall we be long, riding thus,  ere we come to the Burg Gate.\"    \"Yea, or even slower,\" said Ralph, drawing rein somewhat, \"for now I  deem the chase done:  and after all is said, I have no will to slay  Falcon, who is one of my friends, as thou perchance mayest come to be  another.\"    Thereafter he went a hand-gallop till the wood began to thin, and there  were fields of tillage about the highway; and presently Roger said:  \"Thou mayst breathe thy nag now, and ride single, for we are amidst  friends; not even a score of the Dry Tree dare ride so nigh the Burg  save by night and cloud.\"    So Ralph stayed his horse, and he and Roger lighted down, and Ralph  looked about him and saw a stone tower builded on a little knoll amidst  a wheatfield, and below it some simple houses thatched with straw;  there were folk moreover working, or coming and going about the fields,  who took little heed of the two when they saw them standing quiet by  the horse's head; but each and all of these folk, so far as could be  seen, had some weapon.    Then said Ralph:  \"Good fellow, is this the Burg of the Four Friths?\"  The carle laughed, and said:  \"Simple is the question, Sir Knight:  yonder is a watch-tower of the Burg, whereunder husbandmen can live,  because there be men-at-arms therein.  And all round the outskirts of  the Frank of the Burg are there such-like towers to the number of  twenty-seven. For that, say folk, was the tale of the winters of the  Fair Lady who erewhile began the building of the Burg, when she was  first wedded to the Forest Lord, who before that building had dwelt, he  and his fathers, in thatched halls of timber here and there about the  clearings of the wild-wood. But now, knight, if thou wilt, thou mayest  go on softly toward the Gate of the Burg, and if thou wilt I will walk  beside thy rein, which fellowship, as aforesaid, shall be a gain to me.\"    Said Ralph:  \"I pray thee come with me, good fellow, and show me how  easiest to enter this stronghold.\"  So, when Falcon was well breathed,  they went on, passing through goodly acres and wide meadows, with here  and there a homestead on them, and here and there a carle's cot.  Then  came they to a thorp of the smallest on a rising ground, from the  further end of which they could see the walls and towers of the Burg."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16921"],[0,"Plague Ship (#13)"],[1," deep memory of other weapons, other  tactics which could be drawn upon and adapted to his present need.    There was none of the casual atmosphere which had surrounded the affair  between the Salariki clansmen in the hall. Here was ceremony. The storm  priests invoked their own particular grim Providence, and there was an  oath taken over the weapons of battle. When the actual engagement began  the betting among the spectators had reached, Dane decided, epic  proportions. Large sections of Sargolian personal property were due to  change hands as a result of this encounter.    As the chief priest gave the order to engage both Terrans advanced from  their respective ends of the fighting space with the half crouching,  light footed tread of spacemen. Jellico had pulled his net into as close  a resemblance to rope as its bulk would allow. The very type of weapon,  so far removed from any the Traders knew, made it a disadvantage rather  than an asset.    But it was when the Eysie moved out to meet the Captain that Rip's  fingers closed about Dane's upper arm in an almost paralyzing grip.    \"He knows--\"    Dane had not needed that bad news to be made vocal. Having seen the  exploits of the Salariki duelists earlier, he had already caught the  significance of that glide, of the way the I-S champion carried his net.  The Eysie had not had any last minute instruction in the use of Sargolian  weapons--he had practiced and, by his stance, knew enough to make him a  formidable menace. The clamor about the Queen's party rose as the  battle-wise eyes of the clansmen noted that and the odds against Jellico  reached fantastic heights while the hearts of his crew sank.    Only Van Rycke was not disturbed. Now and then he raised his smelling  bottle to his nose with an elegant gesture which matched those of the  befurred nobility around him, as if not a thought of care ruffled his  mind.    The Eysie feinted in a opening which was a rather ragged copy of the  young Salarik's more fluid moves some hours before. But, when the net  settled, Jellico was simply not there, his quick drop to one knee had  sent the mesh flailing in an arc over his bowed shoulders with a good six  inches to spare. And a cry of approval came not only from his comrades,  but from those natives who had been gamblers enough to venture their  wagers on his performance.    Dane watched the field and the fighters through a watery film. The  discomfort he had experienced since downing that mouthful of the cup of  friendship had tightened into a fist of pain clutching his middle in a  torturing grip. But he knew he must stick it out until Jellico's ordeal  was over. Someone stumbled against him and he glanced up to see Ali's  face, a horrible gray-green under the tan, close to his own. For a moment  the Engineer-apprentice caught at his arm for support and then with a  visible effort straightened up. So he wasn't the only one--He looked for  Rip and Weeks and saw that they, too, were ill.    But for a moment all that mattered was the stretch of trampled earth and  the two men facing each other. The Eysie made another cast and this time,  although Jellico was not caught, the slap of the mesh raised a red welt  on his forearm. So far the Captain had been content to play the defensive  role of retreat, studying his enemy, planning ahead.    The Eysie plainly thought the game his, that he had only to wait for a  favorable moment and cinch the victory. Dane began to think it had gone  on for weary hours. And he was dimly aware that the Salariki were also  restless. One or two shouted angrily at Jellico in their own tongue.    The end came suddenly. Jellico lost his footing, stumbled, and went down.  But before his men could move, the Eysie champion bounded forward, his  net whirling out. Only he never reached the Captain. In the very act of  falling Jellico had pulled his legs under him so that he was not supine  but crouched, and his net swept but at ground level, clipping the I-S man  about the shins, entangling his feet so that he crashed heavily to the  sod and lay still.    \"The whip--that Lalox whip trick!\" Wilcox's voice rose triumphantly above  the babble of the crowd. Using his net as if it had been a thong, Jellico  had brought down the Eysie with a move the other had not foreseen.    Breathing hard, sweat running down his shoulders and making tracks  through the powdery red dust which streaked him, Jellico got to his feet  and walked over to the I-S champion who had not moved or made a sound  since his fall. The Captain went down on one knee to examine him.    \"Kill! Kill!\" That was the Salariki, all their instinctive savagery  aroused.    But Jellico spoke to Groft. \"By our customs we do not kill the conquered.  Let his friends bear him hence.\" He took the claw knife the Eysie still  clutched in his hand and thrust it into his own belt. Then he faced the  I-S party and Kallee.    \"Take your man and get out!\" The rein he had kept on his temper these  past days was growing very thin. \"You've made your last play here.\"    Kallee's thick lips drew back in something close to a Salarik snarl. But  neither he nor his men made any reply. They bundled up their unconscious  fighter and disappeared.    Of their own return to the sanctuary of the Queen Dane had only the  dimmest of memories afterwards. He had made the privacy of the forest  road before he yielded to the demands of his outraged interior. And after  that he had stumbled along with Van Rycke's hand under his arm, knowing  from other miserable sounds that he was not alone in his torment.    It was some time later, months he thought when he first roused, that he  found himself lying in his bunk, feeling very weak and empty as if a  large section of his middle had been removed, but also at peace with his  world. As he levered himself up the cabin had a nasty tendency to move  slowly to the right as if he were a pivot on which it swung, and he had  all the sensations of being in free fall though the Queen was still  firmly planeted. But that was only a minor discomfort compared to the  disturbance he remembered.    Fed the semi-liquid diet prescribed by Tau and served up by Mura to him  and his fellow sufferers, he speedily got back his strength. But it had  been a close call, he did not need Tau's explanation to underline that.  Weeks had suffered the least of the four, he the most--though none of  them had had an easy time. And they had been out of circulation three  days.    \"The Eysie blasted last night,\" Rip informed him as they lounged in the  sun on the ramp, sharing the blessed lazy hours of invalidism.    But somehow that news gave Dane no lift of spirit. \"I didn't think they'd  give up--\"    Rip shrugged. \"They may be off to make a dust-off before the Board. Only,  thanks to Van and the Old Man, we're covered all along the line. There's  nothing they can use against us to break our contract. And now we're in  so solid they can't cut us out with the Salariki. Groft asked the Captain  to teach him that trick with the net. I didn't know the Old Man knew  Lalox whip fighting--it's about one of the nastiest ways to get cut to  pieces in this universe--\"    \"How's trade going?\"    Rip's sunniness clouded. \"Supplies have given out. Weeks had an  idea--but it won't bring in Koros. That red wood he's so mad about, he's  persuaded Van to stow some in the cargo holds since we have enough Koros  stones to cover the voyage. Luckily the clansmen will take ordinary trade  goods in exchange for that and Weeks thinks it will sell on Terra. It's  tough enough to turn a steel knife blade and yet it is light and easy to  handle when it's cured. Queer stuff and the color's interesting. That  stockade of it planted around Groft's town has been up close to a hundred  years and not a sign of rot in a log of it!\"    \"Where is Van?\"    \"The storm priests sent for him. Some kind of a gabble-fest on the  star-star level, I gather. Otherwise we're almost ready to blast. And we  know what kind of cargo to bring next time.\"    They certainly did, Dane agreed. But he was not to idle away his morning.  An hour later a caravan came out of the forest, a line of complaining,  burdened orgels, their tiny heads hanging low as they moaned their woes,  the hard life which sent them on their sluggish way with piles of red  logs lashed to their broad toads' backs. Weeks was in charge of the  procession and Dane went to work with the cargo plan Van had left, seeing  that the brilliant scarlet lengths were hoist into the lower cargo hatch  and stacked according to the science of stowage. He discovered that Rip  had been right, the wood for all its incredible hardness was light of  weight. Weak as he still was he could lift and stow a full sized log with  no great difficulty. And he thought Weeks was correct in thinking that it  would sell on their home world. The color was novel, the durability an  asset--it would not make fortunes as the Koros stones might, but every  bit of profit helped and this cargo might cover their fielding fees on  Terra.    Sinbad was in the cargo space when the first of the logs came in. With  his usual curiosity the striped tom cat prowled along the wood, sniffing  industriously. Suddenly he stopped short, spat and backed away, his spine  fur a roughened crest. Having backed as far as the inner door he turned  and slunk out. Puzzled, Dane gave the wood a swift inspection. There were  no cracks or crevices in the smooth surfaces, but as he stopped over the  logs he became conscious of a sharp odor. So this was one scent of the  perfumed planet Sinbad did not like. Dane laughed. Maybe they had better  have Weeks make a gate of the stuff and slip it across the ramp, keeping  Sinbad on ship board. Odd--it wasn't an unpleasant odor--at least to him  it wasn't--just sharp and pungent. He sniffed again and was vaguely  surprised to discover that it was less noticeable now. Perhaps the wood  when taken out of the"]]]
