He is, in  truth, the Protector of those who are wholly devoted to Him and observe  His precepts.    O people of God! Countless are the realms which Our Pen of Glory hath  revealed and manifold the eyes to which it hath imparted true  enlightenment. Yet most of the people in Persia continue to be deprived of  the benefits of profitable counsels and remain sorely lacking in useful  sciences and arts. Formerly these sublime words were especially revealed  by the Pen of Glory in honour of one of the faithful, that perchance those  that have gone astray may embrace the Truth and become acquainted with the  subtleties of the Law of God.    The unbelievers and the faithless have set their minds on four things:  first, the shedding of blood; second, the burning of books; third, the  shunning of the followers of other religions; fourth, the extermination of  other communities and groups. Now however, through the strengthening grace  and potency of the Word of God these four barriers have been demolished,  these clear injunctions have been obliterated from the Tablet and brutal  dispositions have been transmuted into spiritual attributes. Exalted is  His purpose; glorified is His power; magnified is His dominion! Now let us  beseech God--praised be His glory--to graciously guide aright the followers  of the Shi'ih sect and to purge them of unseemly conduct. From the lips of  the members of this sect foul imprecations fall unceasingly, while they  invoke the word 'Mal'un' (accursed)--uttered with a guttural sound of the  letter 'ayn--as their daily relish.    O God my God! Thou hearest the sighing of Him Who is Thy Light (Baha),  hearkenest unto His lamentations in the daytime and in the night season  and knowest that He desireth naught for Himself but rather seeketh to  sanctify the souls of Thy servants and to deliver them from the fire with  which they are beset at all times. O Lord! The hands of Thy well-favoured  servants are raised towards the heaven of Thy bounty and those of Thy  sincere lovers are lifted up to the sublime heights of Thy generosity.  Disappoint them not, I entreat Thee, in that which they seek from the  ocean of Thy favour and from the heaven of Thy grace and the day-star of  Thy bounty. Aid them, O Lord, to acquire such virtues as will exalt their  stations among the peoples of the world. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the  Mighty, the Most Generous.    O people of God! Give ear unto that which, if heeded, will ensure the  freedom, well-being, tranquillity, exaltation and advancement of all men.  Certain laws and principles are necessary and indispensable for Persia.  However, it is fitting that these measures should be adopted in conformity  with the considered views of His Majesty--may God aid him through His  grace--and of the learned divines and of the high-ranking rulers. Subject  to their approval a place should be fixed where they would meet. There  they should hold fast to the cord of consultation and adopt and enforce  that which is conducive to the security, prosperity, wealth and  tranquillity of the people. For were any measure other than this to be  adopted, it could not but result in chaos and commotion.    According to the fundamental laws which We have formerly revealed in the  Kitab-i-Aqdas and other Tablets, all affairs are committed to the care of  just kings and presidents and of the Trustees of the House of Justice.  Having pondered on that which We have enunciated, every man of equity and  discernment will readily perceive, with his inner and outer eyes, the  splendours of the day-star of justice which radiate therefrom.    The system of government which the British people have adopted in London  appeareth to be good, for it is adorned with the light of both kingship  and of the consultation of the people.    In formulating the principles and laws a part hath been devoted to  penalties which form an effective instrument for the security and  protection of men. However, dread of the penalties maketh people desist  only outwardly from committing vile and contemptible deeds, while that  which guardeth and restraineth man both outwardly and inwardly hath been  and still is the fear of God. It is man's true protector and his spiritual  guardian. It behoveth him to cleave tenaciously unto that which will lead  to the appearance of this supreme bounty. Well is it with him who giveth  ear unto whatsoever My Pen of Glory hath proclaimed and observeth that  whereunto he is bidden by the Ordainer, the Ancient of Days.    Incline your hearts, O people of God, unto the counsels of your true, your  incomparable Friend. The Word of God may be likened unto a sapling, whose  roots have been implanted in the hearts of men. It is incumbent upon you  to foster its growth through the living waters of wisdom, of sanctified  and holy words, so that its root may become firmly fixed and its branches  may spread out as high as the heavens and beyond.    O ye that dwell on earth! The distinguishing feature that marketh the  pre-eminent character of this Supreme Revelation consisteth in that We  have, on the one hand, blotted out from the pages of God's holy Book  whatsoever hath been the cause of strife, of malice and mischief amongst  the children of men, and have, on the other, laid down the essential  prerequisites of concord, of understanding, of complete and enduring  unity. Well is it with them that keep My statutes.    Time and again have We admonished Our beloved ones to avoid, nay to flee  from, anything whatsoever from which the odour of mischief can be  detected. The world is in great turmoil, and the minds of its people are  in a state of utter confusion. We entreat the Almighty that He may  graciously illuminate them with the glory of His Justice, and enable them  to discover that which will be profitable unto them at all times and under  all conditions. He, verily is the All-Possessing, the Most High.    We have ere this uttered these sublime words: Let them that bear  allegiance to this Wronged One be even as a raining cloud in moments of  charity and benevolence and as a blazing fire in restraining their base  and appetitive natures.    Gracious God! A thing hath recently happened which caused great  astonishment. It is reported that a certain person(24) went to the seat of  the imperial throne in Persia and succeeded in winning the good graces of  some of the nobility by his ingratiating behaviour. How pitiful indeed,  how deplorable! One wondereth why those who have been the symbols of  highest glory should now stoop to boundless shame. What is become of their  high resolve? Whither is gone the sense of dignity and honour? The sun of  glory and wisdom hath unceasingly been shining above the horizon of  Persia, but nowadays it hath sunk to such a low level that certain  dignitaries have allowed themselves to be treated as playthings in the  hands of the foolish. The aforesaid person hath written such things  concerning this people in the Egyptian press and in the Beirut  Encyclopedia that the well-informed and the learned were astonished. He  proceeded then to Paris where he published a newspaper entitled  Urvatu'l-Vuthqa [The Sure Handle] and sent copies thereof to all parts of  the world. He also sent a copy to the Prison of Akka, and by so doing he  meant to show affection and to make amends for his past actions. In short,  this Wronged One hath observed silence in regard to him. We entreat God,  the True One, to protect him and to shed upon him the light of justice and  fairness. It behoveth him to say:    O God my God! Thou seest me standing before the door of Thy forgiveness  and benevolence, turning my gaze toward the horizon of Thy bountiful  favours and manifold blessings. I beg of Thee by Thy sweet accents and by  the shrill voice of Thy Pen, O Lord of all mankind, to graciously aid Thy  servants as it befitteth Thy days and beseemeth the glory of Thy  manifestation and Thy majesty. Verily potent art Thou to do whatsoever  Thou willest. All they that dwell in the heavens and on the earth bear  witness to Thy power and Thy might, to Thy glory and Thy bounteousness.  Praise be to Thee, O Lord of the worlds and the Well-Beloved of the heart  of every man of understanding!    Thou beholdest, O my God, the essence of poverty seeking the ocean of Thy  wealth and the substance of iniquity yearning for the waters of Thy  forgiveness and Thy tender mercy. Grant Thou, O my God, that which  beseemeth Thy great glory and befitteth the loftiness of Thy boundless  grace. Thou art in truth the All-Bountiful, the Lord of grace abounding,  the Ordainer, the All-Wise. No God is there but Thee, the Most Powerful,  the All-Compelling, the Omnipotent.    O people of God! In this day everyone should fix his eyes upon the horizon  of these blessed words: 'Alone and unaided He doeth whatsoever He  pleaseth.' Whoso attaineth this station hath verily attained the light of  the essential unity of God and is enlightened thereby, while all others  are reckoned in the Book of God among the followers of idle fancy and vain  imagination. Incline your ears to the Voice of this Wronged One and  safeguard the integrity of your stations. It is highly necessary and  imperative that everyone should observe this matter.    Unveiled and unconcealed, this Wronged One hath, at all times, proclaimed  before the face of all the peoples of the world that which will serve as  the key for unlocking the doors of sciences, of arts, of knowledge, of  well-being, of prosperity and wealth. Neither have the wrongs inflicted by  the oppressors succeeded in silencing the shrill voice of the Most Exalted  Pen, nor have the doubts of the perverse or of the seditious been able to  hinder Him from revealing the Most Sublime Word. I earnestly beseech God  that He may protect and purge the people of Baha from the idle fancies and  corrupt imaginings of the followers of the former Faith.    O people "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17314"],[0,"Five Children and It (#13)"],[1,"and dear of you to give  us our wishes, and it seems such a pity it should all be wasted just  because we are too silly to know what to wish for.\"    Anthea had meant to say that--and she had not wanted to say it before  the others. It's one thing to say you're silly, and quite another to  say that other people are.    \"Child,\" said the Sand-fairy sleepily, \"I can only advise you to think  before you speak\"--    \"But I thought you never gave advice.\"    \"That piece doesn't count,\" it said. \"You'll never take it! Besides,  it's not original. It's in all the copy-books.\"    \"But won't you just say if you think wings would be a silly wish?\"    \"Wings?\" it said. \"I should think you might do worse. Only, take care  you aren't flying high at sunset. There was a little Ninevite boy I  heard of once. He was one of King Sennacherib's sons, and a traveller  brought him a Psammead. He used to keep it in a box of sand on the  palace terrace. It was a dreadful degradation for one of us, of course;  still the boy _was_ the Assyrian King's son. And one day he wished for  wings and got them. But he forgot that they would turn into stone at  sunset, and when they did he fell on to one of the winged lions at the  top of his father's great staircase; and what with _his_ stone wings  and the lion's stone wings--well it's not a very pretty story! But I  believe the boy enjoyed himself very much till then.\"    \"Tell me,\" said Anthea, \"why don't our wishes turn into stone now? Why  do they just vanish?\"    \"_Autre temps autres moeurs_,\" said the creature.    \"Is that the Ninevite language?\" asked Anthea, who had learned no  foreign language at school except French.    \"What I mean is,\" the Psammead went on, \"that in the old days people  wished for good solid everyday gifts,--Mammoths and Pterodactyls and  things,--and those could be turned into stone as easy as not. But people  wish such high-flying fanciful things nowadays. How are you going to  turn being beautiful as the day, or being wanted by everybody, into  stone? You see it can't be done. And it would never do to have two  rules, so they simply vanish. If being beautiful as the day _could_ be  turned into stone it would last an awfully long time, you know--much  longer than you would. Just look at the Greek statues. It's just as  well as it is. Good-bye. I _am_ so sleepy.\"    It jumped off her lap--dug frantically, and vanished.    Anthea was late for breakfast. It was Robert who quietly poured a  spoonful of molasses down the Lamb's frock, so that he had to be taken  away and washed thoroughly directly after breakfast. And it was of  course a very naughty thing to do; yet it served two purposes--it  delighted the Lamb, who loved above all things to be completely sticky,  and it engaged Martha's attention so that the others could slip away to  the sand-pit without the Lamb.    They did it, and in the lane Anthea, breathless from the hurry of that  slipping, panted out--    \"I want to propose we take turns to wish. Only, nobody's to have a wish  if the others don't think it's a nice wish. Do you agree?\"    \"Who's to have first wish?\" asked Robert cautiously.    \"Me, if you don't mind,\" said Anthea apologetically. \"And I've thought  about it--and it's _wings_.\"    There was a silence. The others rather wanted to find fault, but it was  hard, because the word \"wings\" raised a flutter of joyous excitement in  every breast.    \"Not so dusty,\" said Cyril generously; and Robert added, \"Really,  Panther, you're not quite such a fool as you look.\"    Jane said, \"I think it would be perfectly lovely. It's like a bright  dream of delirium.\"    They found the Sand-fairy easily. Anthea said--    \"I wish we all had beautiful wings to fly with.\"    The Sand-fairy blew himself out, and next moment each child felt a funny  feeling, half heaviness and half lightness, on its shoulders. The  Psammead put its head on one side and turned its snail eyes from one  side to the other.    [Illustration: The Sand-fairy blew himself out]    \"Not so bad,\" it said dreamily. \"But really, Robert, you're not quite  such an angel as you look.\" Robert almost blushed.    The wings were very big, and more beautiful than you can possibly  imagine--for they were soft and smooth, and every feather lay neatly in  its place. And the feathers were of the most lovely mixed changing  colors, like the rainbow, or iridescent glass, or the beautiful scum  that sometimes floats on water that is not at all nice to drink.    \"Oh--but how can we fly?\" Jane said, standing anxiously first on one  foot and then on the other.    \"Look out!\" said Cyril; \"you're treading on my wing.\"    \"Does it hurt?\" asked Anthea with interest; but no one answered, for  Robert had spread his wings and jumped up, and now he was slowly rising  in the air. He looked very awkward in his knickerbocker suit--his boots  in particular hung helplessly, and seemed much larger than when he was  standing in them. But the others cared but little how he looked,--or how  they looked, for that matter. For now they all spread out their wings  and rose in the air. Of course you all know what flying feels like,  because everyone has dreamed about flying, and is seems so beautifully  easy--only, you can never remember how you did it; and as a rule you  have to do it without wings, in your dreams, which is more clever and  uncommon, but not so easy to remember the rule for. Now the four  children rose flapping from the ground, and you can't think how good the  air felt as it ran against their faces. Their wings were tremendously  wide when they were spread out, and they had to fly quite a long way  apart so as not to get in each other's way. But little things like this  are easily learned.    All the words in the English Dictionary, and in the Greek Lexicon as  well, are, I find, of no use at all to tell you exactly what it feels  like to be flying, so I will not try. But I will say that to look _down_  on the fields and woods instead of _along_ at them, is something like  looking at a beautiful live map, where, instead of silly colors on  paper, you have real moving sunny woods and green fields laid out one  after the other. As Cyril said, and I can't think where he got hold of  such a strange expression, \"It does you a fair treat!\" It was most  wonderful and more like real magic than any wish the children had had  yet. They flapped and flew and sailed on their great rainbow wings,  between green earth and blue sky; and they flew over Rochester and then  swerved round towards Maidstone, and presently they all began to feel  extremely hungry. Curiously enough, this happened when they were flying  rather low, and just as they were crossing an orchard where some early  plums shone red and ripe.    [Illustration: They flew over Rochester]    They paused on their wings. I cannot explain to you how this is done,  but it is something like treading water when you are swimming, and hawks  do it extremely well.    \"Yes, I daresay,\" said Cyril, though no one had spoken. \"But stealing is  stealing even if you've got wings.\"    \"Do you really think so?\" said Jane briskly. \"If you've got wings you're  a bird, and no one minds birds breaking the commandments. At least,  they may _mind_, but the birds always do it, and no one scolds them or  sends them to prison.\"    It was not so easy to perch on a plum-tree as you might think, because  the rainbow wings were so _very_ large; but somehow they all managed to  do it, and the plums were certainly very sweet and juicy.    Fortunately, it was not till they had all had quite as many plums as  were good for them that they saw a stout man, who looked exactly as  though he owned the plum-trees, come hurrying through the orchard gate  with a thick stick, and with one accord they disentangled their wings  from the plum-laden branches and began to fly.    The man stopped short, with his mouth open. For he had seen the boughs  of his trees moving and twitching, and he had said to himself, \"Them  young varmint--at it again!\" And he had come out at once, for the lads  of the village had taught him in past seasons that plums want looking  after. But when he saw the rainbow wings flutter up out of the  plum-tree he felt that he must have gone quite mad, and he did not like  the feeling at all. And when Anthea looked down and saw his mouth go  slowly open, and stay so, and his face become green and mauve in  patches, she called out--    \"Don't be frightened,\" and felt hastily in her pocket for a  threepenny-bit with a hole in it, which she had meant to hang on a  ribbon round her neck, for luck. She hovered round the unfortunate  plum-owner, and said, \"We have had some of your plums; we thought it  wasn't stealing, but now I am not so sure. So here's some money to pay  for them.\"    She swooped down toward the terror-stricken grower of plums, and slipped  the coin into the pocket of his jacket, and in a few flaps she had  rejoined the others.    The farmer sat down on the grass, suddenly and heavily.    [Illustration: The farmer sat down on the grass suddenly and heavily]    \"Well--I'm blessed!\" he said. \"This here is what they call delusions, I  suppose. But this here threepenny\"--he had pulled it out and bitten  it,--\"_that's_ real enough. Well, from this day forth I'll be a better  man. It's the kind of thing to sober a chap for life, this is. I'm glad  it was only wings, though. I'd rather see the birds as aren't there, and  couldn't be, even if they pretend to talk, than some things as I could  name.\"    He got up slowly and heavily, and went indoors, and he was so nice to  his wife that day that she felt quite happy, and said to herself, \"Law,  whatever have a-come to the man!\" and smartened herself up and put a  blue ribbon bow at the place where her collar fastened on, and looked so  pretty that he was kinder than ever. So perhaps the winged children  really did do one good thing that day. If so, it was the only one; for  really there is "]]]
