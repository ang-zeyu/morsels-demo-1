For a hundred years or more  there was no mark of any kind to show where he rests; but now a small  stone bearing his name points out the grave of the founder of the  great state of Pennsylvania.    [Footnote 9: Windsor Castle: see paragraph 77.]      101. Summary.--Charles the Second, king of England, owed William  Penn, a young English Quaker, a large sum of money. In order to settle  the debt, the king gave him a great piece of land in America, and  named it Pennsylvania, or Penn's Woods. Penn wished to make a home  for Quakers in America; and in 1682 he came over, and began building  the city of Philadelphia. When the Revolution broke out, men were  sent from all parts of the country to Philadelphia, to hold a meeting  called the Congress. In 1776, Congress declared the United States  independent.

The twelve English colonies in America; General Oglethorpe  makes a settlement in Georgia.--We have seen[2] that the first real  colony or settlement made in America by the English was in Virginia  in 1607. By the beginning of 1733, or in about a hundred and  twenty-five years, eleven more had been made, or twelve in all. They  stretched along the seacoast, from the farthest coast of Maine to  the northern boundary of Florida, which was then owned by the  Spaniards.[3]    The two colonies farthest south were North Carolina and South  Carolina. In 1733 James Oglethorpe, a brave English soldier, who  afterward became General Oglethorpe, came over here to make a new  settlement. This new one, which made just thirteen[4] in all, was  called Georgia in honor of King George the Second, who gave a piece  of land for it, on the seacoast, below South Carolina.    [Illustration: Map of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.]    [Footnote 1: Oglethorpe (O'gel-thorp).]    [Footnote 2: See paragraph 37.]    [Footnote 3: Because the Spaniards had settled it in 1565; see  paragraph 30.]    [Footnote 4: These thirteen colonies or settlements were: First, the  four New England colonies (New Hampshire, Massachusetts,  Connecticut, and Rhode island; Maine was then part of Massachusetts,  and Vermont was claimed by both New Hampshire and New York). Secondly,  four middle colonies (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, with  Delaware). Thirdly, five southern colonies (Maryland, Virginia,  North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia).]      103. What it was that led General Oglethorpe to make this new  settlement.--General Oglethorpe had a friend in England who was cast  into prison for debt. There the unfortunate man was so cruelly  treated that he fell sick and died, leaving his family in great  distress.    The General felt the death of his friend so much that he set to work  to find out how other poor debtors lived in the London prisons. He  soon saw that great numbers of them suffered terribly. The prisons  were crowded and filthy. The men shut up in them were ragged and  dirty; some of them were fastened with heavy chains, and a good many  actually died of starvation.    General Oglethorpe could not bear to see strong men killed off in  this manner. He thought that if the best of them--those who were  honest and willing to work--could have the chance given them of  earning their living, that they would soon do as well as any men.  It was to help them that he persuaded the king to give the land of  Georgia.      104. Building the city of Savannah; what the people of Charleston,  South Carolina, did; a busy settlement; the alligators.--General  Oglethorpe took over thirty-five families to America in 1733. They  settled on a high bank of the Savannah[5] River, about twenty miles  from the sea. The general laid out a town with broad, straight,  handsome streets, and with many small squares or parks. He called  the settlement Savannah from the Indian name of the river on which  it stands.    [Illustration: SAVANNAH, AS GENERAL OGLETHORPE LAID IT OUT IN 1733.]    The people of Charleston, South Carolina, were glad to have some  English neighbors south of them that would help them fight the  Spaniards of Florida, who hated the English, and wanted to drive them  out. They gave the newcomers a hundred head of cattle, a drove of  hogs, and twenty barrels of rice.    The emigrants set to work with a will, cutting down the forest trees,  building houses, and planting gardens. There were no idlers to be  seen at Savannah: even the children found something to do that was  helpful.    Nothing disturbed the people but the alligators. They climbed up the  bank from the river to see what was going on. But the boys soon taught  them not to be too curious. When one monster was found impudently  prowling round the town, they thumped him with sticks till they  fairly beat the life out of him. After that, the alligators paid no  more visits to the settlers.    [Footnote 5: Savannah (Sa-van'ah).]      105. Arrival of some German emigrants; \"Ebenezer\";[6] \"blazing\"  trees.--After a time, some German Protestants, who had been cruelly  driven out of their native land on account of their religion, came  to Georgia. General Oglethorpe gave them a hearty welcome. He had  bought land of the Indians, and so there was plenty of room for all.  The Germans went up the river, and then went back a number of miles  into the woods; there they picked out a place for a town. They called  their settlement by the Bible name of Ebenezer,[7] which means \"The  Lord hath helped us.\"    There were no roads through the forests, so the new settlers \"blazed\"  the trees; that is, they chopped a piece of bark off, so that they  could find their way through the thick woods when they wanted to go  to Savannah. Every tree so marked stood like a guide-post; it showed  the traveller which way to go until he came in sight of the next one.    [Illustration: THE \"BLAZED\" TREES.]    [Footnote 6: Ebenezer (Eb-e-ne'zer).]    [Footnote 7: See I Sam. vii. 12.]      106. Trying to make silk; the queen's American dress.--The settlers  hoped to be able to get large quantities of silk to send to England,  because the mulberry-tree grows wild in Georgia, and its leaves are  the favorite food of the silkworm.[8] At first it seemed as if the  plan would be successful, and General Oglethorpe took over some  Georgia silk as a present to the queen of England. She had a handsome  dress made of it for her birthday; it was the first American silk  dress ever worn by an English queen. But after a while it was found  that silk could not be produced in Georgia as well as it could in  Italy and France, and so in time cotton came to be raised instead.    [Footnote 8: Silkworm: a kind of caterpillar which spins a fine, soft  thread of which silk is made.]      107. Keeping out the Spaniards; Georgia powder at Bunker Hill;  General Oglethorpe in his old age.--The people of Georgia did a good  work in keeping out the Spaniards, who were trying to get possession  of the part of the country north of Florida. Later, like the settlers  in North Carolina and South Carolina, they did their part in helping  to make America independent of the rule of the king of England. When  the war of the Revolution began, the king had a lot of powder stored  in Savannah. The people broke into the building, rolled out the kegs,  and carried them off. Part of the powder they kept for themselves,  and part they seem to have sent to Massachusetts; so that it is quite  likely that the men who fought at Bunker Hill may have loaded their  guns with some of the powder given them by their friends in Savannah.  In that case the king got it back, but in a somewhat different way  from what he expected.    General Oglethorpe spent the last of his life in England. He lived  to a very great age. Up to the last he had eyes as bright and keen  as a boy's. After the Revolution was over, the king made a treaty  or agreement, by which he promised to let the United States of America  live in peace. General Oglethorpe was able to read that treaty  without spectacles. He had lived to see the colony of Georgia which  he had settled become a free and independent state.      108. Summary.--In 1733 General James Oglethorpe brought over a  number of emigrants from England, and settled Savannah, Georgia.  Georgia was the thirteenth English colony; it was the last one  established in this country. General Oglethorpe lived to see it  become one of the United States of America.

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN  (1706-1790).      109. Growth of Philadelphia; what a young printer was doing for  it.--By the year 1733, when the people of Savannah[1] were building  their first log cabins,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18134"],[0,"Sixteen Months in Four German Prisons: Wesel, Sennelager, Klingelputz, Ruhleben (#13)"],[1," burst, but the Tribunal saw that it was impossible to  shake my resolution. There was another brief discussion. Then the  Chairman turned to one of his colleagues, and in a despairing voice  asked, \"Can you suggest a way out of the difficulty?\"    \"Yes!\" I interrupted. \"Give the interpreter the German and me the  English copy. Let him translate from the German and I will compare with  the English version.\"    The offer was accepted, but now another hitch arose. The interpreter  said he did not think he could read off the translation from the German  right away--at least, it would take time.    The Court was in a quandary. Seeing that this unexpected obstacle was  likely to prejudice my position I grabbed the English text and thrust  the German copy into my interpreter's hands. Telling him to go ahead I  remarked that we could make something out of it. We wrestled with the  translation, although it was a slow and tedious operation, but at last  we finished the task. The German depositions being quite in order, and  fairly translated I signed the papers without further ado.    Now I thought the ordeal was over, but it was not. Picking up my signed  depositions the Chairman proceeded to re-examine me on my defence. He  started from the moment I arrived at Flushing and traced my movements,  minute by minute, to Berlin, followed what I did in the capital between  1.30 a.m. the hour of my arrival and 1.13 p.m. the time of my departure.  The manner in which my movements had been dogged was astonishing and I  recalled the individual whom I had noticed shadowing me in the city. I  saw at once that everything turned upon the instant nature of my  answers, so I replied to every question without the slightest hesitation  and to such effect that I never once contradicted myself.    Only one interval, and that of ten minutes in Berlin, threatened to  engulf me. I could scarcely fill up this gap. It happened to be one of  those idle intervals which one can never explain away very readily or  satisfactorily. We disputed this ten minutes vigorously for about half  an hour, and by the time we had finished I do not think there was a  single second for which an account had not been rendered. My interview  with the Consul also precipitated a storm, especially as by this time I  was becoming bored and felt dead-tired. Every question, however,  sufficed to prove that I was firmly considered to be a spy, and a  dangerous one at that. But even the re-examination came to a close at  last.    Now my heart nearly jumped out of my body. The chairman, picking up the  papers which had been taken from my pocket, withdrew a little book. It  was my diary, which was full of notes. The moment I saw its familiar  cover I cursed the inspiration which had prompted me to keep a diary. I  knew what it contained and I knew the cryptic notes therein would bring  about further explosions and protestations. I was not disappointed.  Opening the little book the Chairman enquired innocently:    \"What do you mean by things being 'lively' in Berlin?\"    \"It is a British expression,\" I retorted, my brain working rapidly to  advance a conclusive reply as I recalled the phrase which I had jotted  down. \"We term things 'lively' when say, as in my case, one is first  thrown out of a cab by a officer and shortly afterwards is flung out of  a restaurant!\"    \"Rather an unusual phrase to use when one recalls the political  situation which prevailed in the capital last Sunday, is it not?\"    \"Possibly from the German point of view, in the light of events.\"    \"Then you had an enlightening chat with an officer? What was it all  about? How did you open conversation with him?\"    \"In the usual British manner. We just chatted about things in general.\"    \"Especially of the war between Germany and England?\"    \"No! Because we were not at war!\"    \"But the officer advised you to return home! Why?\"    \"Because I could not get through to Warsaw!\"    Other incidents of a spirited character raged about other phrases in the  little book, but I was on the alert. The Chairman evidently considered  me to be a match for him in these wrangles because he speedily put the  diary down.    During the proceedings the Chairman made one frantic endeavour to trap  me, and to prove that I was more fully conversant with the language, as  he confidently believed, than I felt disposed to concede. Something was  being read over to me by the Clerk upon which my thoughts were  concentrated. Suddenly the Chairman roared out a terrifying word in the  vernacular. I never moved a hair. I behaved just as if the Chairman had  merely sneezed. My imperturbability appeared to convince him that I  really did not understand German, because no further reference was made  to the fact. Subsequently my interpreter told me that it was fortunate I  did not understand German or I would certainly have retorted to the  Chairman's sudden interjection. I should not have been human had I not  done so. He refused to tell me what the word was or what it meant, so I  was never a whit the wiser.    At last I was told the proceedings with reference to myself were closed.  I had been on the rack for several hours, and when the gate of my cell  clicked upon me for the last time that eventful evening the morning  hours were well advanced. As my interpreter left me to go to his cell I  enquired wearily, though with a trace of anxiety,    \"When shall I know the result?\"    He shrugged his shoulders.    \"Perhaps to-morrow. Who knows?\"    Personally I felt confident that a speedy release would be granted. It  seemed to me impossible to convict upon the evidence. But I was ignorant  of German ways and military court procedure. I was destined to receive a  greater surprise than any which had yet befallen me.          CHAPTER V    WAITING TO BE SHOT      I shall never forget the night of Wednesday, August 5th. After the  excitement of my trial which had left me well nigh exhausted, I threw  myself upon my wooden plank bed to recuperate with a well-earned rest.  But I had just made myself comfortable when a terrible uproar broke out.  The prison trembled and I half feared that it would tumble about our  ears. The emergency bells commenced to clang madly, while the building  was torn with the most terrifying shrieks and howls.    Then the deafening sounds of explosions burst on our ears. At the time I  wondered what was the cause for this din, but the next morning I was  told that during the night the French had made an aerial raid upon  Wesel. From within it sounded as if the whole Allied Army were pounding  the building. On top of the prison anti-aircraft guns were mounted and  when they were discharged, which was continuously and rapidly, they  shook the building violently. Indeed an earthquake could scarcely have  set up a more agitated oscillation of the fabric.    Although the bells rang madly they were not answered. Every gaoler had  left his post; gone no one knew whither. The prisoners thought they had  been deserted. They were haunted by the terror of the prison being set  in flames by the bombardment. The shrieks, cries, howls and wails born  of fright made my blood chill. Outside one could hear the muffled shouts  of officers giving orders, curses, and rapid firing by small arms. The  whole place appeared to have been afflicted with panic, as acute among  the soldiers without as among the prisoners within. For about an hour  pandemonium reigned. Even to me, shut up as I was in a narrow cell, it  was easy to appreciate the terrible and far-reaching undermining effect  which an aerial raid has upon the Teuton mind.    Within the prison next morning it was possible to see the dire effects  which the French aviators had caused. A few cells below me was a  prisoner. When I saw him on the Thursday morning I scarcely recognised  him. As a result of that hour of terror _his hair had gone completely  white!_ Other prisoners were sadly bruised and scarred from frantically  beating their hands and heads against the doors of their cells in the  desperate endeavour to get out. One poor wretch went raving mad.    Notwithstanding the ordeal of the trial, which had deprived me of my  normal span of rest, I was woke up at 5.30 to sweep out my cell. The  strain of the prolonged inquisition of the previous evening upon an  enfeebled physique and brain now commenced to assert itself in an  emphatic manner. I had eaten nothing, not even a crust of the black  bread, for fifty-four hours. Little wonder that I could scarcely keep my  feet. My gaoler observed my condition, but said nothing, although he  modified his customary boorish attitude towards myself.    When I had to make my daily visit to the yard to clean my utensils and  to re-charge my water-jug I staggered down the steps. I stepped out of  the line in my turn and grasped the pump-handle. But I was too weak to  move it. A fellow-prisoner, recognising my plight, dashed forward to  work the pump. As he did one of the guard raised his rifle to club the  man across the head, but thinking better of his action, dropped his  weapon, and permitted him to assist me.    How I crawled back to the cell I can scarcely remember. But I recall  being spurred forward with sundry jabs and prods by the rifle. Reaching  my cell I sank down upon my bed.    How long I lay there it is impossible to say, but presently I became  conscious of some one standing beside me. I wearily sat up to see an  officer. Had he brought me the verdict of the Court? At the thought I  rose to my feet. But no! He had nothing to do with the Tribunal. He eyed  me closely and then turning to the array of basins containing the  untouched food and hunks of black bread he remarked grimly:    \"Do you know you will die if you don't eat your food?\"    \"I shall if I do, so what's the odds? Its smell is sufficient!\"    \"Do you know we can make you eat it?\"    \"You try, and I promise you that you will get it back in double quick  time,\" I"]]]
