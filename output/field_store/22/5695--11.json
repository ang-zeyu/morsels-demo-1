A month later, two visitors called on John at his small, unpainted house  in the center of a hillside cotton patch.    A tall, thin Negress appeared in the doorway. \"Yes, mam, John Van Hook  lives here. He's down in the field with his hoe, digging 'taters.\" She  leaned from the porch and called, \"Daddy, Daddy! Somebody wants to see  you.\" Asked if John was her father, she answered \"No, mam, he is my  husband. I started calling him Daddy when our child was little, so I've  been calling him that ever since. My name is Laney.\"    The walls of the room into which John invited his callers were crudely  plestered with newspapers and the small space was crowded with furniture  of various kinds and periods. The ladder-back chairs he designated for  his guests were beautiful. \"They are plantation-made,\" he explained,  \"and we've had 'em a mighty long time.\" On a reading table a pencil and  tablet with a half-written page lay beside a large glass lamp.  Newspapers and books covered several other tables. A freshly whitewashed  hearth and mantel were crowned by an old-fashioned clock, and at the end  of the room a short flight of steps led to the dining room, built on a  higher floor level.    \"Now, let's see! Where was I?,\" John began. \"Oh, yes, we were talking  about cornshuckings, when I had to leave your office. Well, I haven't  had much time to study about those cornshucking songs to get all the  words down right, but the name of one was _General Religh Hoe_, and  there was another one that was called, _Have a Jolly Crowd, and a Little  Jolly Johnny_.    \"Now you needn't to expect me to know much about cotton pickings, for  you know I have already told you I was raised in North Carolina, and we  were too far up in the mountains for cotton growing, but I have lived in  a cotton growing country for forty-odd years.    \"As to parties and frolics, I guess I could have kept those things in  mind, but when I realized that being on the go every night I could get  off, week in and week out, was turning my mind and heart away from  useful living, I tried to put those things out of my life and to train  myself to be content with right living and the more serious things of  life, and that's why I can't remember more of the things about our  frolics that took place as I was growing up. About all I remember about  the dances was when we danced the cotillion at regular old country  break-downs. Folks valued their dances very highly then, and to be able  to perform them well was a great accomplishment. _Turkey in the Straw_  is about the oldest dance tune I can remember. Next to that is _Taint  Gonna Rain No More_, but the tune as well as words to that were far  different from the modern song by that name. _Rabbit Hair_ was another  favorite song, and there were dozens of others that I just never tried  to remember until you asked me about them.    \"My father lived in Caswell County and he used to tell us how hard it  was for him to get up in the morning after being out most of the night  frolicking. He said their overseer couldn't talk plain, and would call  them long before crack of dawn, and it sounded like he was saying, 'Ike  and a bike, Ike and a bike.' What he meant was, 'Out and about! Out and  about!'    \"Marriage in those days was looked upon as something very solemn, and it  was mighty seldom that anybody ever heard of a married couple trying to  get separated. Now it's different. When a preacher married a couple, you  didn't see any hard liquor around, but just a little light wine to liven  up the wedding feast. If they were married by a justice of the peace,  look out, there was plenty of wine and,\" here his voice was almost  awe-stricken, \"even whiskey too.\"    Laney interrupted at this stage of the story with, \"My mother said they  used to make up a new broom and when the couple jumped over it, they was  married. Then they gave the broom to the couple to use keeping house.\"  John was evidently embarrassed. \"Laney,\" he said, \"that was never  confirmed. It was just hearsay, as far as you know, and I wouldn't tell  things like that.    \"The first colored man I ever heard preach was old man Johnny McDowell.  He married Angeline Pennon and William Scruggs, uncle to Ollie Scruggs,  who lives in Athens now. After the wedding they were all dancing around  the yard having a big time and enjoying the wine and feast, and old man  McDowell, sitting there watching them, looked real thoughtful and sad;  suddenly he said: 'They don't behave like they knew what's been done  here today. Two people have been joined together for life. No matter  what comes, or what happens, these two people must stand by each other,  through everything, as long as they both shall live.' Never before had I  had such thoughts at a wedding. They had always just been times for big  eats, dancing, frolicking, and lots of jokes, and some of them pretty  rough jokes, perhaps. What he said got me to thinking, and I have never  been careless minded at a wedding since that day. Brother McDowell  preached at Clarke's Chapel, about five miles south of Franklin, North  Ca'lina, on the road leading from England to Georgia; that road ran  right through the Van Hook place.\"    Again Laney interrupted her husband. \"My mother said they even had  infare dinners the next day after the wedding. The infare dinners were  just for the families of the bride and groom, and the bride had a  special dress for that occasion that she called her infare dress. The  friends of both parties were there at the big feast on the wedding day,  but not at the infare dinner.\"    \"And there was no such a thing as child marriages heard of in those  days,\" John was speaking again. \"At least none of the brides were under  15 or 16 years old. Now you can read about child brides not more than 10  years old, 'most ever' time you pick up a paper.    \"I don't remember much, about what I played until I got to be about 10  years old. I was a terrible little fellow to imitate things. Old man  Tommy Angel built mills, and I built myself a little toy mill down on  the branch that led to Sugar Fork River. There was plenty of nice  soapstone there that was so soft you could cut it with a pocket knife  and could dress it off with a plane for a nice smooth finish. I shaped  two pieces of soapstone to look like round millstones and set me up a  little mill that worked just fine.    \"We run pretty white sand through it and called that our meal and flour.  My white folks would come down to the branch and watch me run the little  toy mill. I used to make toy rifles and pistols and all sorts of nice  playthings out of that soapstone. I wish I had a piece of that good old  soapstone from around Franklin, so I could carve some toys like I used  to play with for my boy.\"    \"We caught real salmon in the mountain streams,\" John remarked. \"They  weighed from 3 to 25 pounds, and kind of favored a jack fish, only jack  fishes have duck bills, and these salmon had saw teeth. They were  powerful jumpers and when you hooked one you had a fight on your hands  to get it to the bank no matter whether it weighed 3 or 25 pounds. The  gamest of all the fish in those mountain streams were red horses. When I  was about 9 or 10 years old I took my brother's fish gig and went off  down to the river. I saw what looked like the shadow of a stick in the  clear water and when I thrust the gig at it I found mighty quick I had  gigged a red horse. I did my best to land it but it was too strong for  me and pulled loose from my gig and darted out into deep water. I ran  fast as I could up the river bank to the horseshoe bend where a flat  bottom boat belonging to our family was tied. I got in that boat and  chased that fish 'til I got him. It weighed 6 pounds and was 2 feet and  6 inches long. There was plenty of excitement created around that  plantation when the news got around that a boy, as little as I was then,  had landed such a big old fighting fish.\"    \"Suckers were plentiful and easy to catch but they did not give you the  battle that a salmon or a red horse could put up and that was what it  took to make fishing fun. We had canoes, but we used a plain old flat  boat, a good deal like a small ferry boat, most of the time. There was  about the same difference in a canoe and a flat boat that there is in a  nice passenger automobile and a truck.\"    When asked if he remembered any of the tunes and words of the songs he  sang as a child, John was silent for a few moments and then began to  sing:      \"A frog went courtin'     And he did ride       Uh hunh     With a sword and pistol     By his side       Uh hunh.      \"Old uncle Rat laughed,     Shook his old fat side;     He thought his niece     Was going to be the bride.       Uh hunh, uh hunh      \"Where shall the wedding be?       Uh hunh     Where shall the wedding be?       Uh hunh      \"Way down yonder     In a hollow gum tree.       Uh hunh, un hunh, uh hunh.      \"Who shall the waiters be?       Uh hunh     Granddaddy Louse and a     Black-eyed flea.       Uh hunh, uh hunh, uh hunh.\"    Laney reminded him of a song he used to sing when their child was a  baby. \"It is hard for me to formulate its words in my mind. I just  cannot seem to get them,\" he answered, \"but I thought of this one the  other night and promised myself I would sing it for you sometime. It's  _Old Granny Mistletoe_.       \"Old Granny Mistletoe,      Lyin' in the bed,      Out the window       She poked her head.      \"She says, 'Old Man,       The gray goose's gone,     And I think I heard her holler,       King-cant-you-O, King-cant-you-O!'      \"The old fox stepped around,       A mighty fast step.     He hung the old gray goose       Up by the neck.      \"Her wings went flip-flop       Over her back,     And her legs hung"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18500"],[0,"The Complete Works of Robert Burns: Containing his Poems, Songs, and (#13)"],[1,"their  intentions. They parted when they did this, but they parted never to  meet more: she died in a burning fever, during a visit to her  relations to prepare for her marriage; and all that he had of her was  a lock of her long bright hair, and her Bible, which she exchanged for  his.    Even with the tales which he related of rustic love and adventure his  own story mingled; and ladies of rank heard, for the first time, that  in all that was romantic in the passion of love, and in all that was  chivalrous in sentiment, men of distinction, both by education and  birth, were at least equalled by the peasantry of the land. They  listened with interest, and inclined their feathers beside the bard,  to hear how love went on in the west, and in no case it ran quite  smooth. Sometimes young hearts were kept asunder by the sordid  feelings of parents, who could not be persuaded to bestow their  daughter, perhaps an only one, on a wooer who could not count penny  for penny, and number cow for cow: sometimes a mother desired her  daughter to look higher than to one of her station: for her beauty and  her education entitled her to match among the lairds, rather than the  tenants; and sometimes, the devotional tastes of both father and  mother, approving of personal looks and connexions, were averse to  see a daughter bestow her hand on one, whose language in religion was  indiscreet, and whose morals were suspected. Yet, neither the  vigilance of fathers, nor the suspicious care of aunts and mothers,  could succeed in keeping those asunder whose hearts were together; but  in these meetings circumspection and invention were necessary: all  fears were to be lulled by the seeming carelessness of the lass,--all  perils were to be met and braved by the spirit of the lad. His home,  perhaps, was at a distance, and he had wild woods to come through, and  deep streams to pass, before he could see the signal-light, now shown  and now withdrawn, at her window; he had to approach with a quick eye  and a wary foot, lest a father or a brother should see, and deter him:  he had sometimes to wish for a cloud upon the moon, whose light,  welcome to him on his way in the distance, was likely to betray him  when near; and he not unfrequently reckoned a wild night of wind and  rain as a blessing, since it helped to conceal his coming, and proved  to his mistress that he was ready to brave all for her sake. Of rivals  met and baffled; of half-willing and half-unconsenting maidens,  persuaded and won; of the light-hearted and the careless becoming  affectionate and tender; and the coy, the proud, and the satiric being  gained by \"persuasive words, and more persuasive sighs,\" as dames had  been gained of old, he had tales enow. The ladies listened, and smiled  at the tender narratives of the poet.    Of his appearance among the sons as well as the daughters of men, we  have the account of Dugald Stewart. \"Burns,\" says the philosopher,  \"came to Edinburgh early in the winter: the attentions which he  received from all ranks and descriptions of persons, were such as  would have turned any head but his own. He retained the same  simplicity of manners and appearance which had struck me so forcibly  when I first saw him in the country: his dress was suited to his  station; plain and unpretending, with sufficient attention to  neatness: he always wore boots, and, when on more than usual ceremony,  buckskin breeches. His manners were manly, simple, and independent;  strongly expressive of conscious genius and worth, but without any  indication of forwardness, arrogance, or vanity. He took his share in  conversation, but not more than belonged to him, and listened with  apparent deference on subjects where his want of education deprived  him of the means of information. If there had been a little more of  gentleness and accommodation in his temper, he would have been still  more interesting; but he had been accustomed to give law in the circle  of his ordinary acquaintance, and his dread of anything approaching to  meanness or servility, rendered his manner somewhat decided and hard.  Nothing perhaps was more remarkable among his various attainments,  than the fluency and precision and originality of language, when he  spoke in company; more particularly as he aimed at purity in his turn  of expression, and avoided more successfully than most Scotsmen, the  peculiarities of Scottish phraseology. From his conversation I should  have pronounced him to have been fitted to excel in whatever walk of  ambition he had chosen to exert his abilities. He was passionately  fond of the beauties of nature, and I recollect he once told me, when  I was admiring a distant prospect in one of our morning walks, that  the sight of so many smoking cottages gave a pleasure to his mind,  which none could understand who had not witnessed, like himself, the  happiness and worth which cottages contained.\"    Such was the impression which Burns made at first on the fair, the  titled, and the learned of Edinburgh; an impression which, though  lessened by intimacy and closer examination on the part of the men,  remained unimpaired, on that of the softer sex, till his dying-day.  His company, during the season of balls and festivities, continued to  be courted by all who desired to be reckoned gay or polite. Cards of  invitation fell thick on him; he was not more welcome to the plumed  and jewelled groups, whom her fascinating Grace of Gordon gathered  about her, than he was to the grave divines and polished scholars, who  assembled in the rooms of Stewart, or Blair, or Robertson. The classic  socialities of Tytler, afterwards Lord Woodhouslee, or the elaborate  supper-tables of the whimsical Monboddo, whose guests imagined they  were entertained in the manner of Lucullus or of Cicero, were not  complete without the presence of the ploughman of Kyle; and the  feelings of the rustic poet, facing such companies, though of surprise  and delight at first, gradually subsided, he said, as he discerned,  that man differed from man only in the polish, and not in the grain.  But Edinburgh offered tables and entertainers of a less orderly and  staid character than those I have named--where the glass circulated  with greater rapidity; where the wit flowed more freely; and where  there were neither highbred ladies to charm conversation within the  bounds of modesty, nor serious philosophers, nor grave divines, to set  a limit to the license of speech, or the hours of enjoyment. To these  companions--and these were all of the better classes, the levities of  the rustic poet's wit and humour were as welcome us were the tenderest  of his narratives to the accomplished Duchess of Gordon and the  beautiful Miss Burnet of Monboddo; they raised a social roar not at  all classic, and demanded and provoked his sallies of wild humour, or  indecorous mirth, with as much delight as he had witnessed among the  lads of Kyle, when, at mill or forge, his humorous sallies abounded as  the ale flowed. In these enjoyments the rough, but learned William  Nicol, and the young and amiable Robert Ainslie shared: the name of  the poet was coupled with those of profane wits, free livers, and that  class of half-idle gentlemen who hang about the courts of law, or for  a season or two wear the livery of Mars, and handle cold iron.    Edinburgh had still another class of genteel convivialists, to whom  the poet was attracted by principles as well as by pleasure; these  were the relics of that once numerous body, the Jacobites, who still  loved to cherish the feelings of birth or education rather than of  judgment, and toasted the name of Stuart, when the last of the race  had renounced his pretensions to a throne, for the sake of peace and  the cross. Young men then, and high names were among them, annually  met on the pretender's birth-day, and sang songs in which the white  rose of Jacobitism flourished; toasted toasts announcing adherence to  the male line of the Bruce and the Stuart, and listened to the strains  of the laureate of the day, who prophesied, in drink, the dismissal of  the intrusive Hanoverian, by the right and might of the righteous and  disinherited line. Burns, who was descended from a northern race,  whoso father was suspected of having drawn the claymore in 1745, and  who loved the blood of the Keith-Marishalls, under whose banners his  ancestors had marched, readily united himself to a band in whose  sentiments, political and social, he was a sharer. He was received  with acclamation: the dignity of laureate was conferred upon him, and  his inauguration ode, in which he recalled the names and the deeds of  the Grahams, the Erskines, the Boyds, and the Gordons, was applauded  for its fire, as well as for its sentiments. Yet, though he ate and  drank and sang with Jacobites, he was only as far as sympathy and  poesie went, of their number: his reason renounced the principles and  the religion of the Stuart line; and though he shed a tear over their  fallen fortunes--though he sympathized with the brave and honourable  names that perished in their cause--though he cursed \"the butcher,  Cumberland,\" and the bloody spirit which commanded the heads of the  good and the heroic to be stuck where they would affright the  passer-by, and pollute the air--he had no desire to see the splendid  fabric of constitutional freedom, which the united genius of all  parties had raised, thrown wantonly down. His Jacobitism influenced,  not his head, but his heart, and gave a mournful hue to many of his  lyric compositions.    Meanwhile his poems were passing through the press. Burns made a few  emendations of those published in the Kilmarnock edition, and he added  others which, as he expressed it, he had carded and spun, since he  passed Glenbuck. Some rather coarse lines were softened or omitted in  the \"Twa Dogs;\" others, from a change of his personal feelings, were  made in the \"Vision:\" \"Death and"]]]
