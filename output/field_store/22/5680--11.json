Probably members of the society very generally noticed a few weeks since  in the daily papers of the Twin Cities and elsewhere an announcement  that \"certificates of award for special meritorious services in the  advancement of agriculture\" would be made by the Minnesota State  University to Mr. O. C. Gregg, Hon. W. G. LeDuc, Mr. Chas. G. Patten and  Mr. A. W. Latham.    These certificates were awarded Saturday, January 8th, 1916, at the  closing exercises of the Farmers Week at the University Farm before an  audience of twelve hundred people, gathered in the chapel in the  Administration Building. Appropriate exercises were conducted by the  President, Geo. E. Vincent, and the Dean of the University Farm, A.F.  Woods, in the presence of Hon. Fred B. Snyder, President of the Board of  Regents of the State University, and other members of the Board and a  large representation of the professorship of University Farm School,  also occupying the platform.    Dean Woods read a sketch of the life of each one of the recipients, and  the certificates were formally presented to each in turn by the  President of the State University. All the persons who were to receive  this honor were in attendance except Gen. LeDuc, who was probably unable  to be present on account of his extreme age.    When this matter was first called to my attention I felt that it would  be entirely out of place, being its editor, that I should make reference  to it in the society monthly, but as the fact has been widely published  throughout the state, and whatever honor is connected with this  presentation is to be shared with the members of the Horticultural  Society, I have changed my view point in regard to this, and it seems to  me now that the members of the society should be fully informed as to  what has taken place.    Mr. O. C. Gregg received this distinction on account of his connection  with the farmers' institutes of the state, of which he was the pioneer,  and in connection with which he remained as superintendent for some  twenty-two years.    Gen. LeDuc was for a number of years Commissioner of Agriculture at  Washington and introduced many important reforms in the management of  that department.    Mr. Chas. G. Patten is well known to our members of course as the  originator of the Patten's Greening apple, although this is quite an  infinitesimal part of the work that he has done in connection with the  breeding of fruits, the results from which the public are to profit by  largely, we believe, in the early future. At his advanced age of  eighty-four we feel that this honor has been wisely placed.    \"Mr. A. W. Latham has been secretary of the Minnesota State Horticultural  Society for twenty-five years, during which period its membership has  advanced from one or two hundred to thirty-four hundred, making it the  largest horticultural society in the country, and probably,\" as stated  by the Dean in his address, \"the largest in the world.\"    While this distinction has been conferred upon the secretary of your  society it is not to be considered as so much a personal tribute to him  as a recognition of the splendid work done by the society as a whole, in  which every member has had some share. To express fully my thought in  this I will refer briefly to the organization of the society, just half  a century ago, when a handful of earnest men united their efforts under  the name of the Minnesota State Horticultural Society in an endeavor to  solve the difficult problems connected with fruit growing in this  region. None of the men who at that time organized this society are now  living, but others have taken their places, and the important service  that was so well cared for by the earlier membership is being equally as  well prosecuted by those who have succeeded them.    My personal connection with the society began the third year of its  existence, so that I had the high privilege of enjoying personal  acquaintance with practically all those earlier workers in the society,  and indeed most of them were still alive when I came into the  secretaryship twenty-five years ago. It will not be out of place to  speak here particularly of a few of those who are no longer with us:  John S. Harris, that staunch friend, one of the original twelve, whose  medallion hangs on the wall of the horticultural classroom at University  Farm; Peter M. Gideon, whose self-sacrifice gave us the Wealthy apple,  now of worldwide planting--he in whose memory the Gideon Memorial Fund  was created; Col. John H. Stevens, that large hearted man of  unquenchable public spirit; P.A. Jewell, searcher for new fruits and  founder of the Jewell Nursery Company; Truman M. Smith, seven years  president during many dark days; Wyman Elliot, one of the original  twelve, well called by one \"King of the Horticultural Society\"--so  recently taken from us. The institution of learning conferring this  distinction upon us has contributed a full share of workers now no  longer with us; W. W. Pendergast, first principal of the University Farm  School, and for many years president of the society until stricken with  a fatal illness; and Prof. Saml. B. Green of blessed memory, whose loss  we shall never cease to mourn. There are many others who did great  service to the society that I should be glad to speak of here if space  would permit.    In the list of those who are still with us and have served with such  self devotion and courage in advancing the interests of the society, and  that for which it stands, are to be found the names of many men  prominent in various walks of life in our state. It would be out of  place for me to select from this list a few and give them special  prominence where hundreds have contributed to the life and growth of the  association all these many years until the present enviable place now  occupied by the association has been attained. To the executive board of  the society, most of whom have been members of the board for a long  period of years, of course the success of the association is especially  due. Men of initiative in an ambitious and unselfish way working for  the success of the association, they have had very much indeed to do  with its progress.    As I endeavor to recall the personality of those who have been of  special service to us I find the list almost without limit. With what  pleasure and satisfaction have I been permitted to serve with the  members of this society! What willingness to perform the duties  suggested has ever characterized the assistance that has been rendered  by the membership of this society! It has been an exceedingly rare thing  for any member to offer an objection to undertaking any service asked of  him, and with such support as this so readily and heartily given, and  often at large expense to the member, what can be expected other than  such success as has come to our society. I wish I had the ability to  express at this time the thought that is in my heart as I recall all of  these helpful brothers and sisters to whom indeed belongs as much as to  the writer any distinction that comes to the society as a result of  these years of labor.    Notwithstanding the State University have seen fit to refer to this in a  way to indicate that our society has reached some certain vantage  ground, it must not be lost sight of that the real work of the society  is still before it. Whether to be carried on under the present  management or under a changed management we have a right to look ahead  and anticipate the definite and widely expanding results that are still  to come from the services of the members of the society, which we are  sure in the future, as in the past, will be heartily rendered.    A. W. LATHAM, Secy.          June-Bearing Strawberries.    GEO. J. KELLOGG, RETIRED NURSERYMAN, JANESVILLE, WIS.      Any fool that knows enough can grow strawberries, which reminds me of  the preacher in York State who both preached and farmed it. He was  trying to bore a beetle head and could not hold it; a foolish boy came  along and said, \"Why don't you put it in the hog trough?\" \"Well! Well!\"  the preacher said. \"You can learn something from most any fool.\" The boy  said, \"That is just what father says when he hears you preach.\" I don't  expect to tell you much that is new, but I want to emphasize the good  things that others have said:    _Soils._ I once had twenty-one acres of heavy oak, hickory, crab apple  and hazel brush, with one old Indian corn field. I measured hazel brush  twelve feet high, and some of the ground was a perfect network of hazel  roots; the leaf mould had accumulated for ages. The first half acre I  planted to turnips, the next spring I started in to make my fortune. I  set out nineteen varieties of the best strawberries away back in the  time of the Wilson, than which we have never had its equal. The plants  grew well and wintered well, but they did not bear worth a cent, while  just over the fence I had a field on ground that had been worked twenty  years without manure that gave me two hundred and sixty bushels to the  acre. It took three years with other crops to reduce that loose soil  before I could make strawberries pay. My fortune all vanished.    Last June while judging your strawberry show, I found a large collection  of twenty-five kinds of the poorest strawberries I ever saw, grown on  the college grounds. I visited the field, found over a hundred  varieties, well tallied, well cultivated, on new oak opening soil. First  crop, the soil seemed ideal, every thing good except the plants and the  fruit. The foliage was defective and the fruit very poor. Was it the new  soil?    I have always found good garden soil would produce good strawberries;  the best beds were those that followed potatoes.

There were, of course, only a few copies of written rolls of stories,  as compared with the millions of volumes which are constantly being  turned out to-day by our great printing presses. But these few were  much read, and those who read committed many of the stories to memory  so that they could repeat them again and again in their home circles.  In this way life grew more rich in pleasure and interest for many a  Hebrew youth and maiden.      DAVID'S SUCCESSOR, SOLOMON    After David's death his son Solomon was made King. He also encouraged  commerce, both by land and by sea. His ships sailed down the Red Sea  to India, and back, and over the Mediterranean Sea to Spain. They  brought back, according to the author of First Kings, \"gold and  silver, ivory, and apes and peacocks.\"    =Solomon's folly.=--Alas for the happiness of the people, Solomon was  a different kind of a man from his father. Like so many other sons of  good kings he was spoiled by too much luxury and too little  discipline. He had the reputation of being very wise, but in reality  he was very foolish. His chief ambition was to have splendid palaces,  and to make a great display of riches, like the kings of Egypt and  Babylonia.    In order to build these fine buildings and have great numbers of  servants it was necessary to extort the money from his people by heavy  taxes. They were also compelled to labor without pay in his quarries  and elsewhere. So with all the increased wealth in the land and with  all the seeming progress in civilization, the common people were  really wretched--almost worse off than in the old days of disunion and  confusion and fear.    =The disruption of the kingdom.=--As a result of this cruelty and  oppression, the northern tribes, after Solomon's death, rebelled  against his son Rehoboam, who seemed likely to become even more of an  oppressor than his father. The tribe of Judah in the south remained  faithful to the family of David. So the nation was split in two parts,  which were never reunited.    If only all kings could be like David! He indeed was far from perfect;  he was guilty of some very wicked crimes. But on the whole he came  nearer than most kings to the best ideals of the Hebrews for their  rulers: a man \"from among thy brethren: ... neither shall he greatly  multiply to himself silver and gold, ... that his heart be not lifted  up above his brethren, ... and that he turn not aside from the  commandment, to the right hand nor to the left.\"      STUDY TOPICS    1. Look up Joab in a good Bible dictionary, and see how much David  owed to this extraordinary man for his success.    2. Read 2 Samuel 23. 13-17, as a good example of the devotion and  loyalty David was able to awaken in his followers.    3. With which did David do the more for the happiness of his people,  with the sword, or with his harp?    4. Why did Solomon grow up with selfish and extravagant habits and  ideals? Read 2 Samuel 11, 12 for an explanation.          CHAPTER XIV    THE WARS OF KINGS AND THE PEOPLE'S SORROWS      The Hebrews did not greatly better themselves by the division of the  kingdom and by the revolt of the northern tribes from Solomon's son.  There were still kings both in the north and in the south. And all  they cared about was glory and luxury for themselves.      AN ERA OF PERPETUAL WAR    In order to get glory and wealth these kings made war on neighboring  countries. For a long time there was war between the northern and  southern Hebrews. There were long and very bloody wars between the  Hebrews and the Arameans, whose kings ruled in Damascus. There were  many wars between rival candidates for the throne among the Hebrews  themselves. Especially was this true in the northern kingdom where,  during the two hundred years of its separate existence, there was a  revolution on an average every thirty or forty years. In such cases  all the members of the existing royal family would be assassinated and  all persons who defended them or were suspected of sympathizing with  them were put to death. After the murder of hundreds and sometimes  thousands the new upstart conqueror would proclaim himself king.    =Famine and pestilence.=--These constant wars not only brought wounds  and death and sorrow to many homes, they also kept all the people poor  and increased the deadliness of the other great historic curses of  humanity, such as famine. The money and labor spent on war might have  been used in terracing hillsides and fertilizing fields, so that in  times of drought the crops would not wholly fail and starvation and  death might thus have been pushed back a little further from the  cottages of the poor.    Wars also bring disease. In those days, epidemics of disease were  frightfully common at best. They knew nothing about sanitation. Even  in the most important cities, sewage and garbage were dumped in the  streets. Leprosy was an everyday sight. Rats and other vermin swarmed  everywhere except in the palaces of the rich; and when the soldiers  came home from war, bringing with them typhus fever or cholera or the  plague, the people died like flies.    =The dynasty of Omri.=--Among the best of the successors of David and  Solomon were Omri and his son Ahab, in the north. They made peace with  the southern Hebrews in Judah and renewed the old alliance with Tyre.  They built as their capital the beautiful city of Samaria. Ahab  especially was greatly admired as a brave warrior and as a king who on  the whole tried to serve his country well. Yet even Ahab was a despot.  His own glory and wealth were to him of chief importance, and his  people's needs and sufferings secondary.      BACK TO THE DESERT    Under these conditions it was natural that many people should look  back with longing to the olden times, especially to the time of Moses,  before the people had left the desert and settled in Canaan. All these  newfangled ways, they said, are evil. They have brought us only  trouble. Especially bad is the worship of these Baals instead of  Jehovah, the God of our fathers. No doubt Jehovah is jealous and angry  and has brought war and famine and pestilence upon us for just this  reason. Many, indeed, who did not altogether object to the civilized  customs of Canaan were uneasy in their minds because of the worship of  the Baals. When Ahab made his alliance with the king of Tyre he had  built, in Samaria, shrines to the Baal of Tyre. This was in accordance  with the religious ideas of those days. When two countries made an  alliance there was supposed to be an alliance between their gods. But  the Hebrews had made a special covenant to worship no other gods but  only Jehovah. So there were many who were opposed to the worship of  the Baals.    =The Rechabites.=--One Hebrew clan known as the Rechabites, actually  became nomads again and did all they could to persuade others to do  the same. They gave up their houses and lived in tents. They pledged  themselves to drink no wine or strong drink, and they were  enthusiastically devoted to the worship of Jehovah only. Naturally  they hated Ahab for bringing in the worship of the foreign gods of  Tyre. They did much to cause the overthrow of the dynasty of Ahab in  favor of a general named Jehu, who was pledged to drive out the  Phoenicians and their gods.      THE PROPHETS    There were also certain specially religious people, called prophets,  some of whom saw the evils which were ruining the happiness of the  people and fought against them. In the earliest days, these men who  were called prophets were much like the soothsayers of other nations.  They were supposed to have a special power of speaking revelations  from God. Sometimes they went into trances. Sometimes they caused  exciting music to be played in their hearing. Most of them spoke what  seemed likely to be popular with their hearers. For example, once when  Ahab wanted to start a new war against Damascus, he sent for prophets  and some four hundred were brought to him. \"Shall we go to war or  not?\" he asked. All but one, knowing that Ahab's heart was set on the  matter, answered, \"Jehovah says, go to war, and he will give you  victory.\"    =Micaiah.=--The true prophets, however, were men of truth who  worshiped Jehovah and waited for his teaching. Such a man was Micaiah.  When Ahab asked him, \"What do you say?\" his answer was like the  others. But his manner was so sarcastic that the king kept asking him.  He finally declared that Jehovah had revealed to him that the proposed  expedition would end in disaster. For this Micaiah was thrown into a  dungeon. But his prophecy came true. The Hebrews were defeated, and  Ahab himself was killed.    =Elijah.=--The greatest leader in this movement back to the desert and  to Moses, was a prophet named Elijah. He was like the Rechabites in  his aims. He was dressed like a desert nomad and his whole life was  given to the cause of the old desert religion. He had a very clear  understanding as to what was best in that religion. It was not merely  because Jehovah might be jealous of other gods that Elijah fought  against Baal worship, but also because Jehovah really stood for  justice and righteousness as against the unrighteousness of the Baals.  Elijah was not only a champion of Jehovah; he was a champion of the  poor against their oppressors, a champion of the common people against  the despotism of kings, as is so vividly and thrillingly illustrated  in the story of Naboth's vineyard.    =Elisha.=--Elijah's work was carried on after his death by another  prophet named Elisha. He also seems to have been a friend of the  common people. Many traditions of his helpfulness to them are recorded  in the second book of Kings. But his chief aim was to overthrow the  dynasty of Ahab. It was Elisha who, with the help of the Rechabites,  launched the revolution of Jehu.    =A disappointing outcome.=--Jehu was really no better than Ahab. "]]]
