Some thought that he was hiding in town, and  advised a thorough search before they took to their horses. The Native  Son--he of mixed Irish and Spanish blood--told them with languid  certainty that Andy was headed straight for the camp because he would  figure that in camp was where they would least expect to find him.    The opinions of the Native Son were usually worth adopting. In this  case, however, it brought them into the street at the very moment when  Florence Grace Hallman and two homeseekers had ventured from the hotel  in search of them. Slim and Jack Bates and Cal Emmett saw them in time  and shied across the street and into the new barber shop where they sat  themselves down and demanded unnecessary hair-cuts and a shampoo apiece,  and spied upon their unfortunate fellows through the window while they  waited; but the others met the women fairly since it was too late to  turn back without making themselves ridiculous.    \"I was wondering,\" began Miss Hallman in her brisk, business tone,  \"if some of you gentlemen could not help us out in the matter of  conveyances. I have made arrangements for most of my guests, but we  simply can't squeeze another one into the rigs I have engaged--and I've  engaged every vehicle in town except a wheelbarrow I saw in the back  yard of the hotel.\"    \"How many are left out?\" asked Weary, since no one else showed any  symptoms of speech.    \"Oh, not many, thank goodness. Just us three here. You've met Miss  Allen, Mr. Davidson--and Miss Price. And so have you other gentlemen,  because I introduced you at the depot. I went blandly ahead and told  everybody just which rig they were to ride in, and put three in a seat,  at that, and in counting noses I forgot to count our own--\"    \"I really don't see how she managed to overlook mine,\" sighed Miss  Allen, laying a dainty, gloved finger upon a nose that had the tiniest  possible tilt to it. \"Nobody ever overlooked my nose before; it's almost  worth walking to the tract.\"    Irish, standing close beside Weary and looking enough like him to be  a twin instead of a mere cousin, smiled down at her with traitorous  admiration. Miss Allen's nose was a nice nose, and above it twinkled a  pair of warm brown eyes with humorous little wrinkles, around them; and  still above them fluffed a kinky-curly mass of brown hair. Weary looked  at her also, but he did not smile, because she looked a little like his  own schoolma'am, Miss Ruty Satterly--and the resemblance hurt a sore  place in his heart.    \"--So if any of you gentlemen could possibly take us out to the tract,  we'd be eternally grateful, besides keeping our independence intact with  the usual payment. Could you help us out?\"    \"We all came in on horseback,\" Weary stated with a gentle firmness that  was intended to kill their hopes as painlessly as possible.    \"Wouldn't there be room on behind?\" asked Miss Allen with hope still  alive and flourishing.    \"Lots of room,\" Weary assured her. \"More room than you could possibly  use.\"    \"But isn't there any kind of a rig that you could buy, beg, borrow or  steal?\" Miss Hallman insisted. \"These girls came from Wisconsin to take  up claims, and I've promised to see that they get the best there is  to be had. They are hustlers, if I know what the word means. I have a  couple of claims in mind, that I want them to see--and that's why  we three hung back till the rest were all arranged for. I had a rig  promised that I was depending on, and at the last minute discovered it  was not to be had. Some doctor from Havre came and got it for a trip  into the hills. There's no use talking; we just must get out to the  tract as soon as the others do--a little sooner wouldn't hurt. Couldn't  you think of some way?\"    \"We'll try,\" Irish promised rashly, his eyes tying to meet Miss Allen's  and succeeding admirably.    \"What has become of Mr. Green?\" Miss Hallman demanded after she had  thanked Irish with a smile for the qualified encouragement.    \"We don't know,\" Weary answered mildly. \"We were trying to locate him  ourselves.\"    \"Oh, were you? He seems a rather uncertain young man. I rather counted  on his assistance; he promised--\"    \"Mr. Irish has thought of a rig he can use, Miss Hallman,\" said the  Allen girl suddenly. \"He's going to drive us out himself. Let's hurry  and get ready, so we can start ahead of the others. How many minutes  will it take you, Mr. Irish, to have that team here, for us?\"    Irish turned red. He HAD thought of a rig, and he had thought of driving  them himself, but he could not imagine how Miss Allen could possibly;  have known his thoughts. Then and there he knew who would occupy the  other half of the front seat, in case he did really drive the team he  had in mind.    \"I told you she's a hustler,\" laughed Miss Hallman. \"She'll be raising  bigger crops than you men--give her a year to get started. Well, girls,  come on, then.\"    They turned abruptly away, and Irish was left to his accounting with the  Happy Family. He had not denied the thoughts and intentions imputed to  him by the twinkling-eyed Miss Allen. They walked on toward the livery  stable--where was manifested an unwonted activity--waiting for Irish to  clear himself; which he did not do.    \"You going to drive them women out there?\" Pink demanded after an  impatient silence.    \"Why not? Somebody'll have to.\"    \"What team are you going to use!\" asked Jack Bates.    \"Chip's\" Irish did not glance around, but kept striding down the middle  of the road with his hands stuck deep in his pockets.    \"Don't you think you need help, amigo?\" the Native Son insinuated  craftily. \"You can't talk to three girls at once; I could be hired to go  along and take one off your hands. That should help some.\"    \"Like hell you will!\" Irish retorted with characteristic bluntness. Then  he added cautiously, \"Which one?\"    \"That old girl with the blue eyes should not be permitted to annoy the  driver,\" drawled the Native Son. \"Also, Florence Grace might want some  intelligent person to talk to.\"    \"Well, I got my opinion of any man that'll throw in with that bunch,\"  Pink declared hotly. \"Why don't you fellows keep your own side the  fence. What if they are women farmers? They can do just as much  harm--and a darn sight more. You make me sick.\"    \"Let 'em go,\" Weary advised calmly. \"They'll be a lot sicker when the  ladies discover what they've helped do to that bench-land. Come on,  boys--let's pull out, away from all these lunatics. I hate to see them  get stung, but I don't see what we can do about it--only, if they come  around asking me what I think of that land, I'm going to tell 'em.\"    \"And then they'll ask you why you took claims up there, and you'll  tell 'em that, too--will you?\" The Native Son turned and smiled at him  ironically.    That was it. They could not tell the truth without harming their own  cause. They could not do anything except stand aside and see the thing  through to whatever end fate might decree. They thought that Irish and  the Native Son were foolish to take Chip's team and drive those women  fifteen miles or so that they might seize upon land much better left  alone; but that was the business of Irish and the Native Son, who did  not ask for the approval of the Happy Family before doing anything they  wanted to do.    The Happy Family saddled and rode back to the claims, gravely discussing  the potentialities of the future. Since they rode slowly while they  talked, they were presently overtaken by a swirl of dust, behind which  came the matched browns which were the Flying U's crack driving team,  bearing Irish and Miss Allen of the twinkling eyes upon the front seat  of a two seated spring-wagon that had seen far better days than this.  Native Son helped to crowd the back seat uncomfortably, and waved a hand  with reprehensible cheerfulness as they went rattling past.    The Happy Family stared after them with frowning disapproval, and Weary  turned in the saddle and looked ruefully at his fellows.    \"Things won't ever be the same around here,\" he predicted soberly.  \"There goes the beginning of the end of the Flying U, boys--and we ain't  big enough to stop it.\"        CHAPTER 8. FLORENCE GRACE HALLMAN SPEAKS PLAINLY    Andy Green rode thoughtfully up the trail from his cabin in One Man  coulee, his hat tilted to the south to shield his face from the climbing  sun, his eyes fixed absently upon the yellow soil of the hillside. Andy  was facing a problem that concerned the whole Happy Family--and the  Flying U as well. He wanted Weary's opinion, and Miguel Rapponi's, and  Pink's--when it came to that, he wanted the opinion of them all.    Thus far the boys had been wholly occupied with getting their shacks  built and in rustling cooking outfits and getting themselves settled  upon their claims with an air of convincing permanency. Also they had  watched with keen interest--which was something more vital than mere  curiosity--developments where the homeseekers were concerned, and had  not given very much thought to their next step, except in a purely  general way.    They all recognized the fact that, with all these new settlers buzzing  around hunting claims where there was some promise of making things  grow, they would have to sit very tight indeed upon their own land if  they would avoid trouble with \"jumpers.\" Not all the homeseekers were  women. There were men, plenty of them; a few of them were wholly lacking  in experience it is true, but perhaps the more greedy for land because  of their ignorance. The old farmers had looked askance at the high, dry  prairie land, where even drinking water must be hauled in barrels  from some deep-set creek whose shallow gurgling would probably cease  altogether when the dry season came on the heels of June. The old  farmers had asked questions that implied doubt. They had wanted to know  about sub-soil, and average rainfall, and late frosts, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17404"],[0,"Kinship Organisations and Group Marriage in Australia (#13)"],[1,"      |           |    Uknaria      | Tjinguri       | Choongoora  | Choongoora | Jamada    |                 | _Namigili_     | _Nangili_   | _Narbeeta_ |           |                 |                |             |            |           |   {Bulthara     | Tjapeltjeri    | Chavalya    | Chavalya   | Dhalyeree |   {Kabidgi      | _Naltjeri_     | _Nanajerry_ | _Nabajerry_|           |    _Appitchana_ |                |             |            |           |                 |                |             |            |           |    Appungerta   | Thapungarti    | Chowarding  | Changary   | Dhungaree |                 | _Napungerta_   | _Nabungati_ | _Nhermana_ |           |                 |                |             |            |           |    Purula       | Tjupila        | Chooara     | Choolima   | Joolam    |                 | _Naralu_       | _Nooara_    | _Naola_    |           |                 |                |             |            |           |    Ungalla      | Thungalla      | Changally   | Chungalla  | Jungalla  |                 | _Nungalla_     | _Nangally_  | _Nungalla_ |           |                 |                |             |            |           |    Kumara       | Thakomara      | Chagarra    | Chapota    | Jameram   |                 |_Nakomara_      | _Nagarra_   | _Nemira_   |           |                 |                |             |            |           |    Umbitchana   | Tjambin        | Chambeen    | Chambijana | Jummiunga |                 | _Nambin_       | _Nambeen_   | _Nambjana_ |           |  ---------------+----------------+-------------+------------+-----------+      FOOTNOTES:    [54]  Mathews in _Proc.

Allusion has been made in Chapter III to kinship organisations  denominated \"bloods\" and \"shades\" by Mr R.H. Mathews. Whether it is that  some observers have mistaken these for phratries or _vice versa_, it  seems that the names of the two classes of organisation are at present  inextricably intermingled, as the following table shows:     _Tribe_          _Phratry_           _Blood_          _Meaning_  Itchmundi[92]  Kilpara-Muquara   {Mukulo-Ngielpuru   [+]Sluggish and      \"                            {Muggula-Ngipuru[+]    swift blood  Wiradjeri[93]  Mukula-Budthurung  Wonghibon[94]  Mukumura-Ngiel-                  bumura  Wonghi-  }[95]   bon and }     Ngumbun-           Gwaigullimba-    [++]Swift and sluggish   Ngneumba}      Ngurrawan          Gwaimudhan[++]      blood  Euahlayi[96]   Gwaigullean-                            Light and dark                  Gwaimudthen                             blooded  Murawari[97]   Girrana-Merugulli  Muggulu-BumbirraSec.

[94] _Id._ p. 108.      TABLE IV.    The areas covered by the different class and phratry names are not  co-extensive, that is to say a class is associated with more than one  phratry and _vice versa_. The Undekerebina[98] and Yelyuyendi[99] have  phratries (No. 29) which are usually associated with classes but in  their case none have been noted. On the other hand it is not uncommon to  find classes without the corresponding phratry names; this is the case  in the eight class area, among the tribes of N.S. Wales, S. Queensland,  etc.; but no special significance attaches to it unless we are certain  that it is not the negligence of the observer nor the disuse of the  names which has produced this state of things. On the other hand the  relation of phratry and class areas is of the highest importance, as is  shown in Chapter V.
