Such grains as are full and plump, that have a bright and shining  appearance, without any shrivelling and shrinking in the covering of  the skin, are the best; for wrinkled grains have a greater quantity of  skin, or bran, than such as are sound or plump.    Pastry-cooks and bakers judge of the goodness of flour in the manner in  which it comports itself in kneading. The best kind of wheaten flour  assumes, at the instant it is formed into paste by the addition of  water, a very gluey, ductile, and elastic paste, easy to be kneaded, and  which may be elongated, flattened, and drawn in every direction, without  breaking.    For the following fact we are indebted to Mr. Hatchet.    \"Grain which has been heated or burnt in the stack, may in the following  manner be rendered fit for being made into bread:    \"The wheat must be put into a vessel capable of holding at least three  times the quantity, and the vessel filled with boiling water; the grain  should then be occasionally stirred, and the hollow decayed grains,  which float, may be removed. When the water has become cold, or in about  half an hour, it is drawn off. Then rince the corn with cold water, and,  having completely drained it, spread it thinly on the floor of a kiln,  and thus thoroughly dry it, stirring and turning it frequently during  this part of the process.\"[47]      FOOTNOTES:    [43] The sack of marketable flour is by law obliged to weigh 240 pounds,  which is the produce of five bushels of wheat, and is upon an average  supposed to make eighty quartern loaves of bread; and consequently  sixteen of such loaves are made from each bushel of good wheat. It is  admitted, however, that two or three loaves more than the above quantity  can be made from the sack of flour, when it is the _genuine produce_ of  _good wheat_; that is, in the proportion of about sixteen and a half  loaves from each bushel of sound grain, and, it may be presumed, sixteen  from a bushel of medium corn. The expense, in London, of making the sack  of flour into bread, and disposing of it, is about nine shillings.    A bushel of wheat, upon an average, weighs sixty-one pounds; when  ground, the meal weighs 60-3/4 lbs.; which, on being dressed, produces  46-3/4 lbs. of flour, of the sort called _seconds_; which alone is used  for the making of bread in London and throughout the greater part of  this country; and of pollard and bran 12-3/4 lbs., which quantity, when  bolted, produces 3 lbs. of fine flour, this, when sifted, produces in  good second flour 1-1/4 lb.    [44] Whilst correcting this sheet for the press, the printer transmits  to me the following lines:    \"On Saturday last, George Wood, a baker, was convicted before T. Evance,  Esq. Union Hall, of having in his possession a quantity of alum for the  adulteration of bread, and fined in the penalty of 5_l._ and costs,  under 55 Geo. III. c. 99.\"--_The Times_, Oct. 1819.    [45] There are instances of convictions on record, of bakers having used  gypsum, chalk, and pipe clay, in the manufacture of bread.

Trans. for 1817, part i.          _Adulteration of Beer._      Malt liquors, and particularly porter, the favourite beverage of the  inhabitants of London, and of other large towns, is amongst those  articles, in the manufacture of which the greatest frauds are frequently  committed.    The statute prohibits the brewer from using any ingredients in his  brewings, except malt and hops; but it too often happens that those who  suppose they are drinking a nutritious beverage, made of these  ingredients only, are entirely deceived. The beverage may, in fact, be  neither more nor less than a compound of the most deleterious  substances; and it is also clear that all ranks of society are alike  exposed to the nefarious fraud. The proofs of this statement will be  shewn hereafter.[48]    The author[49] of a Practical Treatise on Brewing, which has run  through eleven editions, after having stated the various ingredients for  brewing porter, observes, \"that however much they may surprise, however  pernicious or disagreeable they may appear, he has always found them  requisite in the brewing of porter, and he thinks they must invariably  be used by those who wish to continue the taste, flavour, and appearance  of the beer.[50] And though several Acts of Parliament have been passed  to prevent porter brewers from using many of them, yet the author can  affirm, from experience, he could never produce the present flavoured  porter without them.[51] The intoxicating qualities of porter are to be  ascribed to the various drugs intermixed with it. It is evident some  porter is more heady than other, and it arises from the greater or less  quantity of stupifying ingredients. Malt, to produce intoxication, must  be used in such large quantities as would very much diminish, if not  totally exclude, the brewer's profit.\"    The practice of adulterating beer appears to be of early date. By an  Act so long ago as Queen Anne, the brewers are prohibited from mixing  _cocculus indicus_, or any unwholesome ingredients, in their beer, under  severe penalties: but few instances of convictions under this act are to  be met with in the public records for nearly a century. To shew that  they have augmented in our own days, we shall exhibit an abstract from  documents laid lately before Parliament.[52]    These will not only amply prove, that unwholesome ingredients are used  by fraudulent brewers, and that very deleterious substances are also  vended both to brewers and publicans for adulterating beer, but that the  ingredients mixed up in the brewer's enchanting cauldron are placed  above all competition, even with the potent charms of Macbeth's witches:         \"Root of hemlock, digg'd i' the dark,         +       +       +       +       +         +       +       +       +       +       For a charm of pow'rful trouble,       Like a hell-broth boil and bubble;       Double, double, toil and trouble,       Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.\"    The fraud of imparting to porter and ale an intoxicating quality by  narcotic substances, appears to have flourished during the period of the  late French war; for, if we examine the importation lists of drugs, it  will be noticed that the quantities of cocculus indicus imported in a  given time prior to that period, will bear no comparison with the  quantity imported in the same space of time during the war, although an  additional duty was laid upon this commodity. Such has been the amount  brought into this country in five years, that it far exceeds the  quantity imported during twelve years anterior to the above epoch. The  price of this drug has risen within these ten years from two shillings  to seven shillings the pound.    It was at the period to which we have alluded, that the preparation of  an extract of cocculus indicus first appeared, as a new saleable  commodity, in the price-currents of _brewers'-druggists_. It was at the  same time, also, that a Mr. Jackson, of notorious memory, fell upon the  idea of brewing beer from various drugs, without any malt and hops. This  chemist did not turn brewer himself; but he struck out the more  profitable trade of teaching his mystery to the brewers for a handsome  fee. From that time forwards, written directions, and recipe-books for  using the chemical preparations to be substituted for malt and hops,  were respectively sold; and many adepts soon afterwards appeared every  where, to instruct brewers in the nefarious practice, first pointed out  by Mr. Jackson. From that time, also, the fraternity of  brewers'-chemists took its rise. They made it their chief business to  send travellers all over the country with lists and samples exhibiting  the price and quality of the articles manufactured by them for the use  of brewers only. Their trade spread far and wide, but it was amongst the  country brewers chiefly that they found the most customers; and it is  amongst them, up to the present day, as I am assured by some of these  operators, on whose veracity I can rely, that the greatest quantities of  unlawful ingredients are sold.    The Act of Parliament[53] prohibits chemists, grocers, and druggists,  from supplying illegal ingredients to brewers under a heavy penalty, as  is obvious from the following abstract of the Act.    \"No druggist, vender of, or dealer in drugs, or chemist, or other  person, shall sell or deliver to any licensed brewer, dealer in or  retailer of beer, knowing him to be such, or shall sell or deliver to  any person on account of or in trust for any such brewer, dealer or  retailer, any liquor called by the name of or sold as colouring, from  whatever material the same may be made, or any material or preparation  other than unground brown malt for darkening the colour of worts or  beer, or any liquor or preparation made use of for darkening the colour  of worts or beer, or any molasses, honey, vitriol, quassia, cocculus  Indian, grains of paradise, Guinea pepper or opium, or any extract or  preparation of molasses, or any article or preparation to be used in  worts or beer for or as a substitute for malt or hops; and if any  druggist shall offend in any of these particulars, such liquor  preparation, molasses, &c. shall be forfeited, and may be seized by any  officer of excise, and the person so offending shall for each offence  forfeit 500_l._\"    The following is a list of druggists and grocers, prosecuted by the  Court of Excise, and convicted of supplying unlawful ingredients to  brewers.      _List of Druggists and Grocers, prosecuted and convicted from 1812 to  1819, for supplying illegal Ingredients to Brewers for adulterating  Beer._[54]    John Dunn and another, druggists, for selling adulterating"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19036"],[0,"Germany and the Germans from an American Point of View (#13)"],[1,"facto  laid down its proper functions, and the king must take over the  responsibilities of government that they declined to exercise. The  cavalry boots were beginning to trample their way to Paris, and to the  crowning of an emperor.    In February, 1864, Prussia and Austria together declare war upon  Denmark over the Schleswig-Holstein succession. They agree to govern  the spoils between them, but fall out over the question of their  respective jurisdiction, and the Prussian army being ready, and the  Moltke plan of campaign worked out, war is declared, and in seven  weeks the Treaty of Prague is signed, in 1866, by which Austria gives  up all her rights in Schleswig-Holstein, and abandons her claim to  take part in the reorganization of Germany. The North German  Confederation is formed to include all lands north of the Main;  Schleswig-Holstein, Hanover, the Hesse states, Nassau, and Frankfurt-am-  Main become part of Prussia; and the south German states agree to remain  neutral, but allies of Prussia in war.    On the 11th of March, 1867, a month after the formation of the  Confederation of the North German States, Bismarck proclaims with  pride in the new Reichstag: \"Setzen win Deutschland, so zu sagen, in  den Sattel! Reiten wird es schon koennen!\"    October 13th, 1868, Leopold von Sigmaringen, a German prince of the  House of Hohenzollern, is named for the first time as a candidate for  the Spanish throne. Nobody in Germany, or anywhere else, was much more  interested in this candidature, than we are now interested in the  woman's suffrage or the prohibition candidate at home. But France had  looked on with jealous eyes at the vigorous growth and martial  successes of Prussia. It was thought well to attack her and humiliate  her before she became stronger. All France was convinced, too, that  the southern German states would revert to their old love in case of  actual war, and side with the nephew of their former friend, the great  Napoleon. The French ambassador is instructed to force the pace. Not  only must the Prussian King disavow all intention to support the  candidacy of the German prince, but he must be asked to humiliate  himself by binding himself never in the future to push such claims.    William I is at Ems, and Benedetti, the French ambassador, reluctantly  presses the insulting demand of his country upon the royal gentleman  as he is walking. The King declines to see Benedetti again, and  telegraphs to Bismarck the gist of the interview. Lord Acton writes:  \"He [Bismarck] drew his long pencil and altered the text, showing only  that Benedetti had presented an offensive demand, and that the King  had refused to see him. That there might be no mistake he made this  official by sending it to all the embassies and legations. Moltke  exclaimed, 'You have converted surrender into defiance.'\" The altered  telegram was also sent to the Norddeutscher Allgemeine Zeitung and to  officials. It is not perhaps generally known that General Lebrun went  to Vienna in June, 1870, to discuss an alliance with Austria for an  attack on the North German Confederation in the following spring.  Bismarck knew this. This was on the 13th of July, 1870; on the 16th  the order was given to mobilize the army, on the 31st followed the  proclamation of the King to his people: \"Zur Errettung des  Vaterlandes.\" On August the 2d, King William took command of the  German armies, and on September 1st, Napoleon handed over his sword,  and on January the 18th, 1871, King William of Prussia was proclaimed  German Emperor in the Hall of the Mirrors in the Palace at Versailles.    \"It sounds so lovely what our fathers did,  And what we do is, as it was to them,  Toilsome and incomplete.\"    It is easy to forget in such a rapid survey of events that Bismarck  could have had any serious opposition to face as he tramped through  those eight years, from 1862 to 1870, with a kingdom on his back. It  is easy to forget that King William himself wished to abdicate in  those dark hours, when his people refused him their confidence, and  called a halt upon his endeavors to strengthen the absolutely  essential instrument for Prussia's development, the army; it is easy  to forget that even the silent and seemingly imperturbable Moltke  hesitated and wavered a little at the audacity of his comrade; it is  easy to forget the conspiracy of opposition of the three women of the  court, the Crown Princess, Frau von Blumenthal, and Frau von Gottberg,  all of English birth, and all using needles against this man  accustomed to the Schlaeger and the sword; it is easy to forget that  even Queen Victoria's influence was used against him to prevent the  reaping of the justifiable fruits of victory in 1871; it is easy to  forget what a bold throw it was to go to war with Austria, and to  array Prussia against the very German states she must later bind to  herself; it is easy to forget the dour patience of this irascible  giant with the petulant and often petty legislature with which he had  to deal.    I cannot understand how any German can criticise Bismarck, but there  are official prigs who do; little decorated bureaucrats who live their  lives out poring over papers, with an eye out for a \"von\" before their  bourgeois names, and as void of audacity as a sheep; men who creep up  the stairway to promotion and recognition, clinging with cautious grip  to the banisters. One sees them, their coats covered with the ceramic  insignia of their placid servitude, decorations tossed to them by the  careless hand of a master who is satisfied if they but sign his  decrees, with the i's properly dotted, and the t's unexceptionably  crossed. They are the crumply officials who melted into  defencelessness and moral decrepitude after Frederick the Great, and  again at the glance of Napoleon, and who owe the little stiffness they  have to the fact that Bismarck lived. It is one of the things a  full-blooded man is least able to bear in Germany, to hear the querulous  questioning of the great deeds of this man, whose boot-legs were  stiffer than the backbones of those who decry him.    What a splendid fellow he was!    \"Give me the spirit that, on this life's rough sea,  Loves to have his sails filled with a lusty wind,  Even till his sail-yards tremble and his masts do crack,  And his rapt ship run on her side so low  That she drinks water and her keel ploughs air.  There is no danger to a man that knows  What life and death is -- there's not any law  Exceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawful  That he should stoop to any other law.\"    He was no worshipper of that flimsy culture which is, and has been for  a hundred years, an obsession of the German. He knew, none knew better  indeed, that the choicest knowledge is only mitigated ignorance. He  surprised Disraeli with his mastery of English, and Napoleon with his  fluency in French, both of which he had learned from his Huguenot  professors. The popular man, the popular book, the popular music,  picture, or play, were none of them a golden calf to him. He mastered  what he needed for his work, and pretended to no enthusiasm for  intellectualism as such. He knew that there is no real culture without  character, and that the mere aptitude for knowing and doing without  character is merely the simian cleverness that often dazzles but never  does anything of importance. \"Culture!\" writes Henry Morley, \"the aim  of culture is to bring forth in their due season the fruits of the  earth.\" Any learning, any accomplishments, that do not serve a man to  bring forth the fruits of the earth in their due season are merely  mental gimcracks, flimsy toys, to admire perhaps, to play with, and to  be thrown aside as useless when duty makes its sovereign demands.    Much as Germany has done for the development of the intellectual life  of the world, she has suffered not a little from the superficial  belief still widely held that instruction, that learning, are culture.  Their Great Elector, their Frederick the Great, and their Bismarck,  should have taught them the contrary by now.    The newly crowned German Emperor left Versailles on March 7th for  Berlin, and on March 21st the first Diet of the new empire was opened,  and began the task of adapting the constitution to the altered  circumstances of the new empire.    The German Empire now consists of four kingdoms: Prussia, Bavaria,  Saxony, and Wuertemberg; of six grand duchies: Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt,  Saxe-Weimar, Oldenburg, Meeklenburg-Strelitz, and Mecklenburg-Schwerin;  of five duchies: Saxe-Meinigen, Saxe-Altenburg Saxe-Coburg-Gotha,  Brunswick, and Anhalt; of seven principalities: Schwartzburg-Sondershausen,  Schwartzburg-Rudolstadt, Waldeck, Reuss (older line),  Reuss (younger line), Lippe, and Schaumburg-Lippe; of three free  towns: Hamburg, Bremen, and Luebeck; and of one imperial province:  Alsace Lorraine.    The new empire is in a sense a continuation of the North German  Confederation. There are 25 states, the largest, Prussia, with a  population of over 40,000,000; the smallest, Schaumburg-Lippe, with a  population of a little more than 46,000 and an area of 131 square  miles.    The central or federal authority controls the army, navy, foreign  relations, railways, main roads, canals, post and telegraph, coinage,  weights and measures, copyrights, patents, and legislation over nearly  the whole field of civil and criminal law, regulation of press and  associations, imperial finance and customs tariffs, which are now the  same throughout Germany.    Bavaria still manages her own railways, and Saxony and Wuertemberg have  certain privileges and exemptions. Administration is still almost  entirely in the hands of the separate states.    The law is imperial, but the judges are appointed by the states, and  are under its authority. The supreme court of appeal (Reichsgericht)  sits at Leipsic.    The head of the executive government is the Emperor, no longer"]]]
