He in turn drove his pike at Decatur's  breast, but his blow was also parried, though its violence broke off the  American's sword at the hilt. The active Turk came again, and his  second blow was only partly turned aside, the point of the pike tearing  through Decatur's coat and inflicting a bad wound in his chest.    Before the Turk could strike a third time, Decatur ran in, and the two  instantly engaged in a fierce wrestling bout. The American was the most  skilful, but by sheer strength his enormous antagonist threw him to the  deck, and, gripping him by the throat with one hand, he reached down to  draw a small curved knife, known as a yataghan. It was behind the sash  in his waist and directly in front. Decatur threw both legs over the  back of the Turk and pressed him so close that he could not force his  hand between their bodies to reach his weapon. Decatur's pistol was at  his hip. He was able to withdraw it, and he then did the only thing that  could possibly save his life, though the chances were that the act would  hasten his death.    Reaching over the back of the Turk, he pointed the weapon downward  toward his own breast and pulled the trigger. In most cases the bullet  would have passed through both bodies, but, fortunately, the ball  encountered some obstruction and did not reach the imperiled American.  He shoved off the bulky form, which rolled over on its back, dead.    It must not be supposed that while this furious hand-to-hand encounter  was under way the respective crews were idle. They, too, were fighting  fiercely, and, closing about the struggling commanders, each side  endeavored to help its own. The crowd surged back and forth and became  mixed in inextricable confusion. One of the Turks saw a chance to help  his captain and made a vicious blow at his opponent with his scimiter.  Reuben James, a sailor, who was so wounded in his arms that he could not  use them, thrust his head forward and received the stroke upon his  skull. The wound was a frightful one, but, beyond dispute, it saved the  life of Decatur, who never forgot the man that had done him this  inestimable service.    Reuben James was one of the volunteers who helped Decatur destroy the  _Philadelphia_. He recovered from his terrible wound and did excellent  service in the war of 1812. In one battle he was three times wounded  before he would allow his comrades to carry him below. He lived fully  twenty years after the death of his beloved commander, dying at a good  old age, though he was scarred with sabre cuts, wounded times  innumerable by bullets, and compelled to suffer the amputation of a leg.    The bombardment of Tripoli was less successful than expected. The  shells were of such poor quality that no impression was made on the  defences. All naval operations have proven that, as a rule, ships are  comparatively powerless for aggressive work against forts and batteries  on shore.    An investigation into the cause of the failure of so many shells sent  into Tripoli brought out several interesting facts. Captain Bainbridge,  who carefully noted the results of the bombardment while a prisoner in  the city, stated that out of forty-eight thrown on one day only one  exploded. It was found that the fuses in many of the bombs had been  choked by lead that was poured into them. This was probably done by  French agents in Sicily.    At the beginning of hostilities, the Tripolitans placed great reliance  upon their ability to fight at close quarters. Undeniably, they did  better in such position than in handling their ships. They had all the  viciousness of wild cats, and it has been shown how fiercely they fought  in hand-to-hand encounters; but their experience with the Americans  taught them that they were to be dreaded in any situation where their  anger was aroused, and, as a consequence, the Turks became less eager  for tests of individual strength, skill and bravery.          CHAPTER X.    The Bomb Ketch--A Terrible Missile--Frightful Catastrophe--Diplomacy in  Place of War--Peace.      Whenever a war is under way a number of persons on each side are certain  to come forward with ingenious schemes for injuring their opponents,  through improvements upon the accepted methods of conducting  hostilities. So it came about, after the slight success attained in  bombarding Tripoli, that a plan was formulated for creating  consternation in the blockaded city and bringing the defiant Bashaw to  his senses.    The new scheme was to fix up the _Intrepid_ as a bomb ketch, send her  into the harbor at night and there explode her. While a few had no faith  in the plan, others believed it would cause great destruction and spread  dismay among the Tripolitans.    In the forward hold were stowed one hundred barrels of gunpowder, and on  the deck above were piled one hundred and fifty shells and a lot of shot  and scrap iron. The plan was to give this floating volcano the  appearance of a blockade-runner. Two small boats were taken along, to be  used by the crews after setting off the fuse that was to blow the ketch  into a million atoms. It will be seen that the task was of the most  dangerous nature conceivable, and yet when Captain Preble called for  volunteers it seemed as if every one was eager to go.    The command was given to Master-Commandant Richard Somers, who was of  the same age as Decatur and Stewart, and had established a reputation  for coolness and intrepidity in the operations of the fleet. Midshipman  Henry Wadsworth, an uncle of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, the poet, was  the second in command. They were accompanied by another midshipman named  Israel, who begged so hard to be allowed to go that he could not be  refused, and ten of the best seamen.    After waiting for several days, the night of September 4 was found to be  just what was desired. A fog lay like a blanket on the sea, but it was  so clear overhead that the stars shone with brilliant splendor. Before  the start was made, Decatur, Stewart and Somers, all the most intimate  of friends, had a long talk in the cabin of the ketch, no one else being  present. Each felt the gravity of the situation. Somers, though cool and  composed, seemed to feel a presentiment that he would not return. He  took a ring off his finger, and breaking it apart, gave one portion to  Decatur, one to Stewart, and kept the other for himself. He told his  friends what he wished done in case of his death, and they assured him  that every wish should be respected.    During that last impressive interview Stewart asked Somers what he would  do if discovered and attacked by the enemy.    \"Blow us all up together!\" was the instant response; \"I shall never be  taken prisoner.\"    I may remark here that no writer has recorded this expression of the  gallant Somers, and I give it because Admiral Stewart assured me of its  truth. His recollection of the incident, more than sixty years  afterward, was as vivid as on the succeeding day. Indeed, Stewart, as is  often the case with aged persons, remarked that his memory of  occurrences a half century old was unerring, while of quite recent  incidents it was unreliable.    It was comparatively early in the evening when the ketch got under way  with a favoring breeze. Stewart, with the _Siren_, by order of Preble,  stood toward the northern passage, through which the ketch was to pass.  His purpose was to remain in as close as was safe, and hold himself  ready to pick up the men as they returned in their boats. Stewart turned  his night glass toward the _Intrepid_ and watched her slowly fading  from sight, until she melted into the gloom and not the slightest trace  of her outlines was discernible.    Nothing could be more trying than the waiting of the craft outside, for  Somers' own vessel and two small ones were near at hand. The stillness  was so profound that men heard the suppressed breathing of their  comrades. If one moved, he did so on tiptoe. Few words were spoken, and  all in guarded undertones. The rippling of the water against the prows  and cables was an annoyance, and on more than one forehead great drops  of cold perspiration gathered.    Slowly and painfully the long minutes wore away, until it seemed as if  several hours had passed, when in reality the interval was but a small  part of that period. Every nerve was in this tense state, when suddenly  the boom of a cannon came rolling through the fog from the direction of  the city, followed soon by the rapid firing of artillery. The approach  of the _Intrepid_ had been discovered, and it seemed as if all the  enemy's batteries were blazing away at her. But what of the ketch  itself?    Stewart, like all the rest, was peering into the black mist, when he saw  a star-like point of light, moving with an up and down motion, in a  horizontal line, showing that it was a lantern carried by a man running  along the deck of a ship. Then it dropped out of sight, as if the bearer  had leaped down a hatchway. For a moment all was profound darkness, and  then an immense fan-like expanse of flame shot far up into the sky, as  if from the crater of a volcano, and was crossed by the curving streaks  of fire made by shells in their eccentric flight. Across the water came  the crashing roar of the prodigious explosion, followed a few moments  later by the sounds of wreckage and bodies as they dropped into the sea.  Then again impenetrable gloom and profound stillness succeeded. The  batteries on shore were awed into silence by the awful sight, and the  waiting friends on the ships held their breath.    The hope was that Lieutenant Somers and his companions had fired the  fuse and then rowed away in their boats, but as minute followed minute  without the sound of muffled oars from the hollow night reaching the  straining ears, suspense gave way to sickening dread. The vessels moved  to and fro about the entrance, as if the inanimate things shared in the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1726"],[0,"Theaetetus (#13)"],[1,"into facts  which come to us through the eye and ear, still their origin is a  mere accident which has nothing to do with their true nature. They  are universal and unseen; they belong to all times--past, present, and  future. Any worthy notion of mind or reason includes them. The proof of  them is, 1st, their comprehensiveness and consistency with one another;  2ndly, their agreement with history and experience. But sensation is of  the present only, is isolated, is and is not in successive moments. It  takes the passing hour as it comes, following the lead of the eye or  ear instead of the command of reason. It is a faculty which man has in  common with the animals, and in which he is inferior to many of them.  The importance of the senses in us is that they are the apertures of the  mind, doors and windows through which we take in and make our own the  materials of knowledge. Regarded in any other point of view sensation  is of all mental acts the most trivial and superficial. Hence the term  'sensational' is rightly used to express what is shallow in thought and  feeling.    We propose in what follows, first of all, like Plato in the Theaetetus,  to analyse sensation, and secondly to trace the connexion between  theories of sensation and a sensational or Epicurean philosophy.    Paragraph I. We, as well as the ancients, speak of the five senses, and  of a sense, or common sense, which is the abstraction of them. The  term 'sense' is also used metaphorically, both in ancient and modern  philosophy, to express the operations of the mind which are immediate or  intuitive. Of the five senses, two--the sight and the hearing--are of  a more subtle and complex nature, while two others--the smell and the  taste--seem to be only more refined varieties of touch. All of them  are passive, and by this are distinguished from the active faculty of  speech: they receive impressions, but do not produce them, except in so  far as they are objects of sense themselves.    Physiology speaks to us of the wonderful apparatus of nerves, muscles,  tissues, by which the senses are enabled to fulfil their functions. It  traces the connexion, though imperfectly, of the bodily organs with the  operations of the mind. Of these latter, it seems rather to know the  conditions than the causes. It can prove to us that without the brain we  cannot think, and that without the eye we cannot see: and yet there is  far more in thinking and seeing than is given by the brain and the eye.  It observes the 'concomitant variations' of body and mind. Psychology,  on the other hand, treats of the same subject regarded from another  point of view. It speaks of the relation of the senses to one another;  it shows how they meet the mind; it analyzes the transition from sense  to thought. The one describes their nature as apparent to the outward  eye; by the other they are regarded only as the instruments of the mind.  It is in this latter point of view that we propose to consider them.    The simplest sensation involves an unconscious or nascent operation  of the mind; it implies objects of sense, and objects of sense have  differences of form, number, colour. But the conception of an object  without us, or the power of discriminating numbers, forms, colours,  is not given by the sense, but by the mind. A mere sensation does not  attain to distinctness: it is a confused impression, sugkechumenon ti,  as Plato says (Republic), until number introduces light and order  into the confusion. At what point confusion becomes distinctness is a  question of degree which cannot be precisely determined. The distant  object, the undefined notion, come out into relief as we approach  them or attend to them. Or we may assist the analysis by attempting  to imagine the world first dawning upon the eye of the infant or of a  person newly restored to sight. Yet even with them the mind as well  as the eye opens or enlarges. For all three are inseparably bound  together--the object would be nowhere and nothing, if not perceived by  the sense, and the sense would have no power of distinguishing without  the mind.    But prior to objects of sense there is a third nature in which they  are contained--that is to say, space, which may be explained in various  ways. It is the element which surrounds them; it is the vacuum or void  which they leave or occupy when passing from one portion of space to  another. It might be described in the language of ancient philosophy, as  'the Not-being' of objects. It is a negative idea which in the course  of ages has become positive. It is originally derived from the  contemplation of the world without us--the boundless earth or sea, the  vacant heaven, and is therefore acquired chiefly through the sense of  sight: to the blind the conception of space is feeble and inadequate,  derived for the most part from touch or from the descriptions of others.  At first it appears to be continuous; afterwards we perceive it to be  capable of division by lines or points, real or imaginary. By the  help of mathematics we form another idea of space, which is altogether  independent of experience. Geometry teaches us that the innumerable  lines and figures by which space is or may be intersected are absolutely  true in all their combinations and consequences. New and unchangeable  properties of space are thus developed, which are proved to us in a  thousand ways by mathematical reasoning as well as by common experience.  Through quantity and measure we are conducted to our simplest and purest  notion of matter, which is to the cube or solid what space is to  the square or surface. And all our applications of mathematics are  applications of our ideas of space to matter. No wonder then that they  seem to have a necessary existence to us. Being the simplest of our  ideas, space is also the one of which we have the most difficulty in  ridding ourselves. Neither can we set a limit to it, for wherever we  fix a limit, space is springing up beyond. Neither can we conceive a  smallest or indivisible portion of it; for within the smallest there  is a smaller still; and even these inconceivable qualities of space,  whether the infinite or the infinitesimal, may be made the subject of  reasoning and have a certain truth to us.    Whether space exists in the mind or out of it, is a question which has  no meaning. We should rather say that without it the mind is incapable  of conceiving the body, and therefore of conceiving itself. The mind may  be indeed imagined to contain the body, in the same way that Aristotle  (partly following Plato) supposes God to be the outer heaven or circle  of the universe. But how can the individual mind carry about the  universe of space packed up within, or how can separate minds have  either a universe of their own or a common universe? In such conceptions  there seems to be a confusion of the individual and the universal. To  say that we can only have a true idea of ourselves when we deny the  reality of that by which we have any idea of ourselves is an absurdity.  The earth which is our habitation and 'the starry heaven above' and  we ourselves are equally an illusion, if space is only a quality or  condition of our minds.    Again, we may compare the truths of space with other truths derived from  experience, which seem to have a necessity to us in proportion to the  frequency of their recurrence or the truth of the consequences which may  be inferred from them. We are thus led to remark that the necessity  in our ideas of space on which much stress has been laid, differs in a  slight degree only from the necessity which appears to belong to other  of our ideas, e.g. weight, motion, and the like. And there is another  way in which this necessity may be explained. We have been taught it,  and the truth which we were taught or which we inherited has never been  contradicted in all our experience and is therefore confirmed by it. Who  can resist an idea which is presented to him in a general form in every  moment of his life and of which he finds no instance to the contrary?  The greater part of what is sometimes regarded as the a priori intuition  of space is really the conception of the various geometrical figures of  which the properties have been revealed by mathematical analysis. And  the certainty of these properties is immeasurably increased to us by our  finding that they hold good not only in every instance, but in all the  consequences which are supposed to flow from them.    Neither must we forget that our idea of space, like our other ideas,  has a history. The Homeric poems contain no word for it; even the later  Greek philosophy has not the Kantian notion of space, but only the  definite 'place' or 'the infinite.' To Plato, in the Timaeus, it is  known only as the 'nurse of generation.' When therefore we speak of  the necessity of our ideas of space we must remember that this is a  necessity which has grown up with the growth of the human mind, and  has been made by ourselves. We can free ourselves from the perplexities  which are involved in it by ascending to a time in which they did not  as yet exist. And when space or time are described as 'a priori forms or  intuitions added to the matter given in sensation,' we should consider  that such expressions belong really to the 'pre-historic study' of  philosophy, i.e. to the eighteenth century, when men sought to explain  the human mind without regard to history or language or the social  nature of man.    In every act of sense there is a latent perception of space, of which  we only become conscious when objects are withdrawn from it. There are  various ways in which we may trace the connexion between them. We may  think of space as unresisting matter, and of matter as divided into  objects; or of objects again as formed by abstraction into a collective  notion of matter, and of matter as rarefied into space. And motion may  be conceived as the union of there and"]]]
