But then I'm not, you see.\"    \"Why isn't it simple, anyhow?\"    \"Well, let's have the explanation then, and I'll undertake to give you  a simpler one afterwards. Go on. Only remember the key is on the outside  of the door to start with.\"    \"Yes; well, I don't mind that. Mark goes in to see his brother, and they  quarrel and all the rest of it, just as Cayley was saying. Cayley hears  the shot, and in order to give Mark time to get away, locks the door,  puts the key in his pocket and pretends that Mark has locked the door,  and that he can't get in. How's that?\"    \"Hopeless, Watson, hopeless.\"    \"Why?\"    \"How does Cayley know that it is Mark who has shot Robert, and not the  other way round?\"    \"Oh!\" said Bill, rather upset. \"Yes.\" He thought for a moment, \"All  right. Say that Cayley has gone into the room first, and seen Robert on  the ground.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Well, there you are.\"    \"And what does he say to Mark? That it's a fine afternoon; and could he  lend him a pocket-handkerchief? Or does he ask him what's happened?\"    \"Well, of course, I suppose he asks what happened,\" said Bill  reluctantly.    \"And what does Mark say?\"    \"Explains that the revolver went off accidentally during a struggle.\"    \"Whereupon Cayley shields him by doing what, Bill? Encouraging him to do  the damn silliest thing that any man could possibly do--confess his guilt  by running away!\"    \"No, that's rather hopeless, isn't it?\" Bill thought again. \"Well,\"  he said reluctantly, \"suppose Mark confessed that he'd murdered his  brother?\"    \"That's better, Bill. Don't be afraid of getting away from the accident  idea. Well then, your new theory is this. Mark confesses to Cayley  that he shot Robert on purpose, and Cayley decides, even at the risk of  committing perjury, and getting into trouble himself, to help Mark to  escape. Is that right?\"    Bill nodded.    \"Well then, I want to ask you two questions. First, is it possible, as I  said before dinner, that any man would commit such an idiotic murder--a  murder that puts the rope so very tightly round his neck? Secondly, if  Cayley is prepared to perjure himself for Mark (as he has to, anyway,  now), wouldn't it be simpler for him to say that he was in the office  all the time, and that Robert's death was accidental?\"    Bill considered this carefully, and then nodded slowly again.    \"Yes, my simple explanation is a wash-out,\" he said. \"Now let's have  yours.\"    Antony did not answer him. He had begun to think about something quite  different.          CHAPTER IX. Possibilities of a Croquet Set      \"What's the matter?\" said Bill sharply.    Antony looked round at him with raised eyebrows.    \"You've thought of something suddenly,\" said Bill. \"What is it?\"    Antony laughed.    \"My dear Watson,\" he said, \"you aren't supposed to be as clever as  this.\"    \"Oh, you can't take me in!\"    \"No.... Well, I was wondering about this ghost of yours, Bill. It seems  to me--\"    \"Oh, that!\" Bill was profoundly disappointed. \"What on earth has the  ghost got to do with it?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Antony apologetically. \"I don't know what anything  has got to do with it. I was just wondering. You shouldn't have brought  me here if you hadn't wanted me to think about the ghost. This is where  she appeared, isn't it?\"    \"Yes.\" Bill was distinctly short about it.    \"How?\"    \"What?\"    \"I said, 'How?'\"    \"How? How do ghosts appear? I don't know. They just appear.\"    \"Over four or five hundred yards of open park?\"    \"Well, but she had to appear here, because this is where the original  one--Lady Anne, you know--was supposed to walk.\"    \"Oh, never mind Lady Anne! A real ghost can do anything. But how did  Miss Norris appear suddenly over five hundred yards of bare park?\"    Bill looked at Antony with open mouth.    \"I--I don't know,\" he stammered. \"We never thought of that.\"    \"You would have seen her long before, wouldn't you, if she had come the  way we came?\"    \"Of course we should.\"    \"And that would have spoilt it rather. You would have had time to  recognize her walk.\"    Bill was interested now.    \"That's rather funny, you know, Tony. We none of us thought of that.\"    \"You're sure she didn't come across the park when none of you were  looking?\"    \"Quite. Because, you see, Betty and I were expecting her, and we kept  looking round in case we saw her, so that we should all be playing with  our backs to her.\"    \"You and Miss Calladine were playing together?\"    \"I say, however do you know that?\"    \"Brilliant deductive reasoning. Well, then you suddenly saw her?\"    \"Yes, she walked across that side of the lawn.\" He indicated the  opposite side, nearer to the house.    \"She couldn't have been hiding in the ditch? Do you call it the moat, by  the way?\"    \"Mark does. We don't among ourselves. No, she couldn't. Betty and I  were here before the others, and walked round a bit. We should have seen  her.\"    \"Then she must have been hiding in the shed. Or do you call it the  summer-house?\"    \"We had to go there for the bowls, of course. She couldn't have been  there.\"    \"Oh!\"    \"It's dashed funny,\" said Bill, after an interval for thought. \"But it  doesn't matter, does it? It has nothing to do with Robert.\"    \"Hasn't it?\"    \"I say, has it?\" said Bill, getting excited again.    \"I don't know. We don't know what has, or what hasn't. But it has  got something to do with Miss Norris. And Miss Norris--\" He broke off  suddenly.    \"What about her?\"    \"Well, you're all in it in a kind of way. And if something unaccountable  happens to one of you a day or two before something unaccountable  happens to the whole house, one is well, interested.\" It was a good  enough reason, but it wasn't the reason he had been on the point of  giving.    \"I see. Well?\"    Antony knocked out his pipe and got up slowly.    \"Well then, let's find the way from the house by which Miss Norris  came.\"    Bill jumped up eagerly.    \"By Jove! Do you mean there's a secret passage?\"    \"A secluded passage, anyway. There must be.\"    \"I say, what fun! I love secret passages. Good Lord, and this afternoon  I was playing golf just like an ordinary merchant! What a life! Secret  passages!\"    They made their way down into the ditch. If an opening was to be found  which led to the house, it would probably be on the house side of the  green, and on the outside of the ditch. The most obvious place at which  to begin the search was the shed where the bowls were kept. It was a  tidy place as anything in Mark's establishment would be. There were two  boxes of croquet things, one of them with the lid open, as if the  balls and mallets and hoops (neatly enough put away, though) had been  recently used; a box of bowls, a small lawn-mower, a roller and so  forth. A seat ran along the back of it, whereon the bowls-players could  sit when it rained.    Antony tapped the wall at the back.    \"This is where the passage ought to begin. It doesn't sound very hollow,  does it?\"    \"It needn't begin here at all, need it?\" said Bill, walking round with  bent head, and tapping the other walls. He was just too tall to stand  upright in the shed.    \"There's only one reason why it should, and that is that it would save  us the trouble of looking anywhere else for it. Surely Mark didn't  let you play croquet on his bowling-green?\" He pointed to the croquet  things.    \"He didn't encourage it at one time, but this year he got rather keen  about it. There's really nowhere else to play. Personally I hate the  game. He wasn't very keen on bowls, you know, but he liked calling it  the bowling-green, and surprising his visitors with it.\"    Antony laughed.    \"I love you on Mark,\" he said. \"You're priceless.\"    He began to feel in his pockets for his pipe and tobacco, and then  suddenly stopped and stiffened to attention. For a moment he stood  listening, with his head on one side, holding up a finger to bid Bill  listen too.    \"What is it?\" whispered Bill.    Antony waved him to silence, and remained listening. Very quietly he  went down on his knees, and listened again. Then he put his ear to the  floor. He got up and dusted himself quickly, walked across to Bill and  whispered in his ear:    \"Footsteps. Somebody coming. When I begin to talk, back me up.\"    Bill nodded. Antony gave him an encouraging pat on the back, and stepped  firmly across to the box of bowls, whistling loudly to himself. He took  the bowls out, dropped one with a loud bang on the floor, said, \"Oh,  Lord!\" and went on:    \"I say, Bill, I don't think I want to play bowls, after all.\"    \"Well, why did you say you did?\" grumbled Bill.    Antony flashed a smile of appreciation at him.    \"Well, I wanted to when I said I did, and now I don't want to.\"    \"Then what do you want to do?\"    \"Talk.\"    \"Oh, right-o!\" said Bill eagerly.    \"There's a seat on the lawn--I saw it. Let's bring these things along in  case we want to play, after all.\"    \"Right-o!\" said Bill again. He felt safe with that, not wishing to  commit himself until he knew what he was wanted to say.    As they went across the lawn, Antony dropped the bowls and took out his  pipe.    \"Got a match?\" he said loudly.    As he bent his head over the match, he whispered, \"There'll be somebody  listening to us. You take the Cayley view,\" and then went on in his  ordinary voice, \"I don't think much of your matches, Bill,\" and struck  another. They walked over to the seat and sat down.    \"What a heavenly night!\" said Antony.    \"Ripping.\"    \"I wonder where that poor devil Mark is now.\"    \"It's a rum business.\"    \"You agree with Cayley that it was an accident?\"    \"Yes. You see, I know Mark.\"    \"H'm.\" Antony produced a pencil and a piece of paper and began to write  on his knee, but while he wrote, he talked.

Allow me to introduce my friend, Mr. Welford of  Virginia.\"    The Secretary bowed stiffly and Dick nodded his head with indifference.    \"The Italian Minister with whom I've just been talking wishes the honor  of an introduction for his Secretary. Miss Jennie, will you meet him?\"    \"Certainly--\"    \"He's looking forward to the possible new Empire of the South,\" Holt  whispered, \"and proposes at an early day to forestall the French--\"    Dick threw him a look of scorn as he returned to the door and rose with  a scowl.    \"I'll go out and get fresh air.\"    \"Don't go--\"    \"I can't breathe in here. Two's company and three's a crowd.\"    She seized his arm:    \"Please sit down, Dick.\"    \"I'll be back directly--\"    In spite of her protest he bounded up the steps of the gallery, turned  sharply to the right, avoided the intruders and disappeared in the  crowd.    The Secretary of War bowed again:    \"Miss Barton, permit me to introduce to you Signor Henrico Socola,  Secretary to His Excellency, the Minister of Sardinia.\"    The slender figure bent low with an easy grace.    \"Pleased to meet you, Signor Socola,\" Jennie responded, lifting the  heavy lashes from her lustrous brown eyes with the slightest challenge  to his.    \"The pleasure is all mine, Mad'moiselle,\" he gravely replied.    \"You'll excuse me now if I hurry on?\" the Secretary said, again bowing  and disappearing in the crowd.    \"Mr. Holt tells me, Miss Barton, that you know every Senator on the  floor.\"    \"Yes. My father has been in Congress and the Senate for twenty years.\"    \"You'll explain the drama to me to-day when the curtain rises?\"    \"If I can.\"    \"I'll be so much obliged--\" he paused and the even white teeth smiled  pleasantly. \"I'm pretty well up on American history but confess a little  puzzled to-day. Your Southern Senators are really going to surrender  their power here without a struggle?\"    \"What do you mean?\" the girl asked with a slight frown.    \"That your Democratic party has still a majority in both the House and  the Senate. If the Southern members simply sit still in their places,  the incoming administration of Abraham Lincoln will be absolutely  powerless. The new President can not even call a cabinet to his side  without their consent.\"    \"The North has elected their President,\" Jennie answered with decision.  \"The South scorns to stoop to the dishonor of cheating them out of it.  They've won the election. They can have it. The South will go and build  a government of her own--as we built this one--\"    \"And fight twenty-three million people of the North?\"    \"If forced to--yes!\"    \"With the certainty of an uprising of your slaves at home?\"    Jennie laughed.    \"Our slaves would fight for us if we'd let them--\"    A curious smile twitched the lips of the Italian.    \"You speak with great confidence, Miss Barton!\"    \"Yes. I know what I'm talking about.\"    The keen eyes watched her from the shadows of the straight thick brows.    \"And your Senators who took a solemn oath in entering this Chamber to  support the Constitution will leave their seats in violation of that  oath?\"    The Southern girl flushed, turned with quick purpose to answer, laughed  and said with winning frankness:    \"You don't mind if I give you my father's answer in his own words? I  know them by heart--\"    \"By all means.\"    \"An oath to support the Constitution of the United States does _not_  bind the man who takes it to support an administration elected by a mob  whose purpose is to subvert the Constitution!\"    \"Oh,--I see,\" was the quiet response.    \"You speak English with perfection, Signor!\" Jennie said with a smile.    \"Yes, Mad'moiselle, I've spent my life in the Diplomatic service.\"    He bowed gravely, lifted his head and caught the smile on the lips of  the Secretary of War standing in the shadows of the doorway of the  Diplomatic gallery.    The stately figure of John C. Breckinridge, the Vice-President, suddenly  mounted the dais and his piercing eyes swept the assembly. He rapped for  order and the silence which followed was as the hush of death.    \"The curtain rises on our drama, Mad'moiselle,\" the smooth even voice  said.    \"Sh!\" the girl whispered.          CHAPTER II    THE PARTING      The breathless galleries leaned forward to catch the slightest sound  from the arena below.    One by one the Senators from the seceding Southern States rose and  renounced their allegiance to the United States in obedience to the  voice of their people.    With each solemn exit the women of the galleries grew hysterical, waved  their perfumed handkerchiefs and shouted their approval with cries of  sympathy and admiration.    David Yulee, Stephen K. Mallory and Benjamin Fitzpatrick had each closed  his portfolio and with slow measured tread marched down the crowded  aisle and out of the Chamber never again to enter its doors.    All eyes were focused now on the brilliant young Senator from Alabama,  Clement C. Clay, Jr. It was understood that he had prepared an eloquent  defense of his action and would voice the passionate feeling of the  masses of the Southern people in this his last utterance in the  crumbling temple of the old Republic.    He rose in his place, lifted his strong head with its leonine locks and  broad, high forehead, paused a moment and began his speech in the clear  steady tones of the trained orator, master of himself, his theme and his  audience. The Northern Senators met his gaze with scorn and he answered  with a look of bold defiance.    The formal announcement of the secession of his State he made in brief  sharp sentences and plunged at once into the reasons for their solemn  act.    \"Forty-two years ago, Alabama was admitted into the Union,\" he declared  in ringing tones. \"She entered it as she goes out, with the Republic  convulsed by the hostility of the North to her domestic institutions.  Not a decade has passed, not a year has elapsed since her birth as a  State that has not been marked by the steady and insolent growth of the  mob violence of the North which has demanded the confiscation of her  property and the destruction of the foundations of her civilization.    \"Who are the leaders of these mobs who seek thus to overthrow the  Constitution? Who are these hypocrites who claim the championship of  freedom and the moral leadership of the world?    \"The men who sold their own slaves to us because they could not use them  with profit in a northern climate; the men who built and manned every  American slave ship that ever sailed the seas; the sons of old Peter  Faneuil of Boston who built Faneuil Hall, their cradle of liberty, out  of the profits of slave ships whose trade the Southern people had  forbidden by law; the men who have flooded Congress for two generations  with petitions to dissolve the Union; the men who threatened to secede  with the addition of every foot of territory we have added to our  Republic!    \"These are the men who have denied to the manhood of the South Christian  Communion because they could not endure what they have been pleased to  style the moral leprosy of Slavery! These are the men who refuse us  permission to sojourn or even pass through the sacred precincts of a  Northern State and dare to carry our servants with us. These are the men  who deny to the South equal rights in the lands of the West bought by  Southern blood and brains and added to our inheritance against their  furious protests. These are the men who burn the sacred charters of  American Liberty in their public squares, and inscribe on their banners  the foul motto:    \"'The Constitution is an agreement with Death, a covenant with Hell.'    \"These are the men who dare to call us traitors! These are the men who  have deliberately passed laws in fourteen Northern States nullifying the  provisions of the Constitution of the Union which they have sworn to  defend and enforce--\"    The speaker paused and lifted high above his head a little morocco bound  volume.    \"Here in the presence of Almighty God--the God of our fathers, and these  witnesses, I read its solemn provisions which the laws of fourteen  Northern States have brazenly and openly defied!\"    He opened the little book and slowly read:    \"'Article 4, Section 2.    \"'_No person held to service of labor in one State, under the laws  thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or  regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor--but shall  be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may  be due._'\"    He turned suddenly to the Northern Senators:    \"Your States have not only repudiated the Constitution you have sworn to  uphold, but your emissaries have invaded the peaceful South and sought  to lay it waste with fire and sword and servile insurrection. You have  murdered Southern men who have dared demand their rights on Northern  soil. You have invaded the borders of Southern States, burned their  dwellings and murdered their people. You have proclaimed John Brown, the  criminal maniac who sought to murder innocent and helpless men, women  and children in Virginia, a hero and martyr and then denounced _us_ in  your popular meetings, your religious and legislative assemblies as  habitual violators of the laws of God and the rights of humanity! You  have exerted all the moral and physical agencies that human ingenuity  can devise or a devil's malice employ "]]]
