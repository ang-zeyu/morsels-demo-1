The windows by no means escape the general deluge. A servant scrambles out  upon the penthouse, at the risk of her neck, and, with a mug in her hand  and a bucket within reach, dashes innumerable gallons of water against the  glass panes, to the great annoyance of passengers in the street.    I have been told that an action at law was once brought against one of  these water nymphs, by a person who had a new suit of clothes spoiled by  this operation: but after long argument, it was determined that no damages  could be awarded; inasmuch as the defendant was in the exercise of a legal  right, and not answerable for the consequences. And so the poor gentleman  was doubly non-suited; for he lost both his suit of clothes and his suit  at law.    These smearings and scratchings, these washings and dashings, being duly  performed, the next ceremonial is to cleanse and replace the distracted  furniture. You may have seen a house raising, or a ship launch--  recollect, if you can, the hurry, bustle, confusion, and noise of such a  scene, and you will have some idea of this cleansing match. The misfortune  is, that the sole object is to make things clean. It matters not how many  useful, ornamental, or valuable articles suffer mutilation or death under  the operation. A mahogany chair and a carved frame undergo the same  discipline; they are to be made clean at all events; but their  preservation is not worthy of attention.    For instance: a fine large engraving is laid flat upon the floor; a number  of smaller prints are piled upon it, until the superincumbent weight  cracks the lower glass--but this is of no importance. A valuable picture  is placed leaning against the sharp corner of a table; others are made to  lean against that, till the pressure of the whole forces the corner of the  table through the canvas of the first. The frame and glass of a fine print  are to be cleaned; the spirit and oil used on this occasion are suffered  to leak through and deface the engraving--no matter. If the glass is clean  and the frame shines, it is sufficient--the rest is not worthy of  consideration. An able arithmetician hath made a calculation, founded on  long experience, and proved that the losses and destruction incident to  two white washings are equal to one removal, and three removals equal to  one fire.    This cleansing frolic over, matters begin to resume their pristine  appearance: the storm abates, and all would be well again; but it is  impossible that so great a convulsion in so small a community should pass  over without producing some consequences. For two or three weeks after the  operation, the family are usually afflicted with sore eyes, sore throats,  or severe colds, occasioned by exhalations from wet floors and damp walls.      I know a gentleman here who is fond of accounting for everything in a  philosophical way. He considers this, what I call a custom, as a real  periodical disease peculiar to the climate. His train of reasoning is  whimsical and ingenious, but I am not at leisure to give you the detail.  The result was, that he found the distemper to be incurable; but after  much study, he thought he had discovered a method to divert the evil he  could not subdue. For this purpose, he caused a small building, about  twelve feet square, to be erected in his garden, and furnished with some  ordinary chairs and tables, and a few prints of the cheapest sort. His  hope was, that when the whitewashing frenzy seized the females of his  family, they might repair to this apartment, and scrub, and scour, and  smear to their hearts' content; and so spend the violence of the disease  in this outpost, whilst he enjoyed himself in quiet at headquarters. But  the experiment did not answer his expectation. It was impossible it  should, since a principal part of the gratification consists in the lady's  having an uncontrolled right to torment her husband at least once in every  year; to turn him out of doors, and take the reins of government into her  own hands.    There is a much better contrivance than this of the philosopher's; which  is, to cover the walls of the house with paper. This is generally done.  And though it does not abolish, it at least shortens the period of female  dominion. This paper is decorated with various fancies; and made so  ornamental that the women have admitted the fashion without perceiving the  design.    There is also another alleviation to the husband's distress. He generally  has the sole use of a small room or closet for his books and papers, the  key of which he is allowed to keep. This is considered as a privileged  place, even in the whitewashing season, and stands like the land of Goshen  amidst the plagues of Egypt. But then he must be extremely cautious, and  ever upon his guard; for, should he inadvertently go abroad and leave the  key in his door, the housemaid, who is always on the watch for such an  opportunity, immediately enters in triumph with buckets, brooms, and  brushes--takes possession of the premises, and forthwith puts an his books  and papers \"to rights,\" to his utter confusion, and sometimes serious  detriment.

This truly remarkable man was the son of a  bookseller and stationer; he was born in Lichfield, Staffordshire,  England. He entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1728; but, at the end of  three years, his poverty compelled him to leave without taking his degree.  In 1736, he married Mrs. Porter, a widow of little culture, much older  than himself, but possessed of some property. The marriage seems to have  been a happy one, nevertheless; and, on the death of his wife, in 1752,  Johnson mourned for her, most sincerely. Soon after his marriage, he  opened a private school, but, obtained only three pupils, one of whom was  David Garrick, afterward the celebrated actor. In 1737, he removed to  London, where he lived for most of the remainder of his life. Here he  entered upon literary work, in which he continued, and from which he  derived his chief support, although at times it was but a meager one, His  \"Vanity of Human Wishes\" was sold for ten guineas. His great Dictionary,  the first one of the English language worthy of mention, brought him  1575 Pounds, and occupied his time for seven years. Most of the money he  received for the work went to pay his six amanuenses. The other most  famous of his numerous literary works are \"The Rambler,\" \"Rasselas,\" \"The  Lives of the English Poets,\" and his edition of Shakespeare. In person,  Johnson was heavy and awkward; he was the victim of scrofula in his youth,  and of dropsy in his old age. In manner, he was boorish and overbearing;  but his great powers and his wisdom caused his company to be sought by  many eminent men of his time.  ###      Omar, the son of Hassan, had passed seventy-five years in honor and  prosperity. The favor of three successive caliphs had filled his house  with gold and silver; and whenever he appeared, the benedictions of the  people proclaimed his passage.    Terrestrial happiness is of short continuance, The brightness of the flame  is wasting its fuel; the fragrant flower is passing away in its own odors.  The vigor of Omar began to fail; the curls of beauty fell from his head;  strength departed from his hands, and agility from his feet. He gave back  to the caliph the keys of trust, and the seals of secrecy; and sought no  other pleasure for the remainder of life than the converse of the wise and  the gratitude of the good.    The powers of his mind were yet unimpaired. His chamber was filled by  visitants, eager to catch the dictates of experience, and officious to pay  the tribute of admiration. Caleb, the son of the viceroy of Egypt, entered  every day early, and retired late. He was beautiful and eloquent; Omar  admired his wit, and loved his docility.    \"Tell me,\" said Caleb, \"thou to whose voice nations have listened, and  whose wisdom is known to the extremities of Asia, tell me, how I may  resemble Omar the prudent? The arts by which thou hast gained power and  preserved it, are to thee no longer necessary or useful; impart to me the  secret of thy conduct, and teach me the plan upon which thy wisdom has  built thy fortune.\"    \"Young man,\" said Omar, \"it is of little use to form plans of life. When I  took my first survey of the world, in my twentieth year, having considered  the various conditions of mankind, in the hour of solitude I said thus to  myself, leaning against a cedar which spread its branches over my head:  'Seventy years are allowed to man; I have yet fifty remaining.    \" 'Ten years I will allot to the attainment of knowledge, and ten I will  pass in foreign countries; I shall be learned, and therefore I shall be  honored; every city will shout at my arrival, and every student will  solicit my friendship.

The following  may help the observer:--    On October 8th, 1867, at about half-past eleven in the evening, I  noticed that Algol had reached its minimum of brilliancy. Hence the next  minimum was attained at about a quarter-past eight on the evening of  October 11th; the next at about five on the evening of October 14th,  and so on. Now, if this process be carried on, it will be found that the  next evening minimum occurred at about 10h. (_circiter_) on the evening  of October 31st, the next at about 11h. 30m. on the evening of November  20th. Thus at whatever hour any minimum occurs, another occurs _six  weeks and a day later_, at about the same hour. This would be exact  enough if the period of variation were _exactly_ 2d. 20m. 48s., but the  period is nearly a minute greater, and as there are fifteen periods in  six weeks and a day, it results that there is a difference of about 13m.  in the time at which the successive recurrences at nearly the same hour  take place. Hence we are able to draw up the two following Tables, which  will suffice to give all the minima conveniently observable during the  next two years. Starting from a minimum at about 11h. 45m. on November  20th, 1867, and noticing that the next 43-day period (with the 13m.  added) gives us an observation at midnight on January 2nd, 1868, and  that successive periods would make the hour later yet, we take the  minimum next after that of January 2nd, viz. that of January 5th, 1868,  8h. 48m., and taking 43-day periods (with 13m. added to each), we get  the series--                     h.  m.

Thus, suppose the observer wants to look for a minimum during  the last fortnight in August, 1868. The first table gives him no  information, the latter gives him a minimum at 8h. 19m. P.M. on August  30; hence of course there is a minimum at 11h. 31m. P.M. on August 27;  and there are no other conveniently observable minima during the  fortnight in question.    The cause of the remarkable variation in this star's brilliancy has been  assigned by some astronomers to the presence of an opaque secondary,  which transits Algol at regular intervals; others have adopted the view  that Algol is a luminous secondary, revolving around an opaque primary.  Of these views the former seems the most natural and satisfactory. It  points to a secondary whose mass bears a far greater proportion to that  of the primary, than the mass even of Jupiter bears to the sun; the  shortness of the period is also remarkable. It may be noticed that  observation points to a gradual diminution in the period of Algol's  variation, and the diminution seems to be proceeding more and more  rapidly. Hence (assuming the existence of a dark secondary) we must  suppose that either it travels in a resisting medium which is gradually  destroying its motion, or that there are other dependent orbs whose  attractions affect the period of this secondary. In the latter case the  decrease in the period will attain a limit and be followed by an  increase.    However, interesting as the subject may be, it is a digression from  telescopic work, to which we now return.    Within the confines of the second map in Plate 4 is seen the fine star  [gamma] Andromedae. At the hour of our observations it lies high up  towards E.S.E. It is seen as a double star with very moderate telescopic  power, the distance between the components being upwards of 10\"; their  magnitudes 3 and 5-1/2, their colours orange and green. Perhaps there is  no more interesting double visible with low powers. The smaller star is  again double in first-class telescopes, the components being yellow and  blue according to some observers, but according to others, both green.    Below [gamma] Andromedae lie the stars [beta] and [gamma] Triangulorum,  [gamma] a fine naked-eye triple (the companions being [delta] and [eta]  Triangulorum), a fine object with a very low power. To the right is  [alpha] Triangulorum, certainly less brilliant than [beta]. Below  [alpha] are the three stars [alpha], [beta], and [gamma] Arietis, the  first an unequal and difficult double, the companion being purple, and  only just visible (under favourable circumstances) with a good 3-inch  telescope; the last an easy double, interesting as being the first ever  discovered (by Hook, in 1664), the colours of components white and grey.    Immediately below [alpha] Arietis is the star [alpha] Ceti, towards the  right of which (a little lower) is Mira, a wonderful variable. This star  has a period of 331-1/3 days; during a fortnight it appears as a star of  the 2nd magnitude,--on each side of this fortnight there is a period of  three months during one of which the star is increasing, while during  the other it is diminishing in brightness: during the remaining five  months of the period the star is invisible to the naked eye. There are  many peculiarities and changes in the variation of this star, into which  space will not permit me to enter.    Immediately above Mira is the star [alpha] Piscium at the knot of the  Fishes' connecting band. This is a fine double, the distance between the  components being about 3-1/2\", their magnitudes 5 and 6, their colours  pale green and blue (see Plate 5).    Close to [gamma] Aquarii (see Frontispiece, Map 4), above and to the  left of it, is the interesting double [zeta] Aquarii; the distance  between the components is about 3-1/2\", their magnitudes 4 and 4-1/2,  both whitish yellow. The period of this binary seems to be about 750  years.    Turning next towards the south-west we see the second-magnitude star  [epsilon] Pegasi, some 40 deg. above the horizon. This star is a wide but  not easy double, the secondary being only of the ninth magnitude; its  colour is lilac, that of the primary being yellow.    Towards the right of [epsilon] Pegasi and lower down are seen the three  fourth-magnitude stars which mark the constellation Equuleus. Of these  the lowest is [alpha], to the right of which lies [epsilon] Equulei, a  fifth-magnitude star, really triple, but seen as a double star with  ordinary telescopes (Plate 5). The distance between the components is  nearly 11\", their colours white and blue, their magnitudes 5-1/2 and  7-1/2. The primary is a very close double, which appears, however, to be  opening out rather rapidly.    Immediately below Equuleus are the stars [alpha]^{1} and [alpha]^2  Capricorni, seen as a naked-eye double to the right of and above [beta].  Both [alpha]^1 and [alpha]^2 are yellow; [alpha]^2 is of the 3rd,  [alpha]^1 of the 4th magnitude; in a good telescope five stars are seen,  the other three being blue, ash-coloured, and lilac. The star [beta]  Capricorni is also a wide double, the components yellow and blue, with  many telescopic companions.    To the right of Equuleus, towards the west-south-west is the  constellation Delphinus. The upper left-hand star of the rhombus of  stars forming the head of the Delphinus is the star [gamma] Delphini, a  rather easy double (see Plate 5), the components being nearly 12\" apart,  their magnitudes 4 and 7, their colours golden yellow and flushed grey.    Turn we next to the charming double Albireo, on the beak of Cygnus,  about 36 deg. above the horizon towards the west. The components are 34-1/2\"  apart, their magnitudes 3 and 6, their colours orange-yellow, and blue.  It has been supposed (perhaps on insufficient evidence) that this star  is merely an optical double. It must always be remembered that a certain  proportion of stars (amongst those separated by so considerable a  distance) _must_ be optically combined only.    The star [chi] Cygni is a wide double (variable) star. The components  are separated by nearly 26\", their magnitudes 5 and 9, their colours  yellow and light blue. [chi] may be found by noticing that there is a  cluster of small stars in the middle of the triangle formed by the stars  [gamma], [delta], and [beta] Cygni (see Map 4, Frontispiece), and that  [chi] is the nearest star _of the cluster_ to [beta]. The star [phi]  Cygni, which is just above and very close to [beta] (Albireo), does not  belong to the cluster. [chi] is about half as far again from [phi] as  [phi] from Albireo. But as [chi] descends to the 11th magnitude at its  minimum the observer must not always expect to find it very easily. It  has been known to be invisible at the epoch when it should have been  most conspicuous. The period of this variable is 406 days.    The star 61 Cygni is an interesting one.
