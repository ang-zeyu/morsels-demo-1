The lake is  situated about thirty-five miles from here, and we will make a  two-days' march to the spot, stopping on the road over night, in true  soldier style, weather permitting.\"    \"Hurrah!\" burst out half a dozen cadets.    \"Three cheers for Captain Putnam!\" called out Tom, and they were given  with a will.    \"I am told that the lake is an excellent one for fishing and for  bathing, and I have already engaged six boats which the cadets will be  allowed to use from time to time.\"    Again there was a cheer and with it a loud clapping of hands.    \"While in camp you may play such games as you please, during off time,  and we will see if we cannot arrange for contests at swimming, rowing,  and running, and to the winners suitable prizes shall be given.\"    \"Hurrah for Captain Putnam!\" came the cry once more, and again a cheer  arose.    \"When will we start, captain?\"    \"Wish we were going right now!\"    \"We shall start Monday morning,\" was the answer. \"To-morrow we will get  out our tents and camping outfits and see that all are in first-class  order. It is perhaps needless to add that during this encampment the  officers will be in authority during all but off hours, when myself and  my assistants will take charge.\"    This ended the talk, and the students immediately broke up into little  groups to discuss the good news.    \"We ought to have just a boss good time while in camp,\" cried Sam.  \"Think of living in tents, and having nothing to do but fish, and swim,  and make yourself comfortable.\"    \"Sam must be getting lazy,\" returned Dick. \"But I grant you I think it  will be first-class myself.\"    About the only pupil who did not relish going into camp was William  Philander Tubbs.    \"It will be beastly to live out in the open, on the ground,\" said  Tubbs. \"Supposing it should rain? Why, we'll all get wet!\"    \"Never mind, that will make you grow, Tubby,\" said Sam.    \"Sam Rover, how often must I tell you not to address me as--ah--Tubby.  My full name is--\"    \"Oh, I know that--William Longfellow Washington Hezekiah Philander  Salamander Tubbs. But you can't expect me to say that every time, can  you?\" questioned Sam innocently.    \"Mine cracious! vos dot his hull name?\" burst in Hans Mueller. \"It's  apout as long as a freight drain, ain't it, alretty!\"    \"No, my name is--\"    \"Perhaps I forgot one or two syllables,\" interrupted Sam. \"Very sorry,  I'm sure.\"    \"I said my name--\"    \"I know you said it, half a dozen times, Billy. But you see life is so  very short, and time so precious--\"    \"I meant to say--\"    \"Sorry, Billy, but I can't wait to hear it all,\" cried Sam, and ran  away.    \"He is--er--extremely rude,\" murmured Tubbs.    \"Put dot's a long name, ain't it?\" said Hans, \"I couldn't remember dot  no more as I can remember der names of all der kings py England  alretty.\"    \"Oh, I am disgusted!\" sighed William Philander, and started to walk  away.    \"Vot is you disgusted apout, Mr. Dubbs?\"    \"Because they won't call me by my proper name.\"    \"Do da call you by your imbrober name?\" asked Hans innocently.    \"Eh?\"    \"I said, do da call you py your imbrober name?\" repeated the German  youth.    \"Oh, don't talk to me,\" howled Tubbs, and walked away more disconcerted  than ever.    \"Dot fellow vas so sharp like a pox of bebber, ain't it?\" sighed Hans  to himself.    The preparations for the annual encampment went forward rapidly. All of  the outfit was inspected with care and found to be in good order. Each  cadet was provided with a blanket, and a knapsack full of extra  underclothing and other necessary things. The captain had already  engaged three big wagons to carry the tents, poles, and cooking utensils,  including several camp stoves, and from another quarter cots were to be  sent to the camp direct, so that the cadets would not be compelled to  lie upon the ground.    \"Now, I guess everything is ready,\" said Dick; late Saturday evening.    Sunday was a day of rest for the most part. In the morning the majority  of the students marched to church under the directions of the captain  and Mr. Strong, and part of the afternoon was spent in writing letters  to the folks at home. \"Lights out,\" sounded half an hour earlier than  usual, so that the cadets might get a good sleep before starting out on  the two days' march.          CHAPTER XV    ON THE MARCH TO CAMP      _Rat-tat-tat!_ _Rat-tat-tat!_ _Rat-tat-tat!_    The cadets got their first taste of the annual encampment early in the  morning, when, instead of hearing the familiar bell, they were awakened  by the rolling of the drum.    \"Time to get up, everybody!\" cried Sam, flinging the covers from him.  \"It won't do to be late this morning.\"    \"That is true, Private Rover,\" came solemnly from Dick. \"I will fine  any soldier of my command who is behind time.\"    \"Thank you, Captain Rover, I'll remember that,\" came from one of the  other cadets. \"And how is Lieutenant Rover this morning\"?    \"Fine as silk,\" came from Tom, who was already splashing in the cold  water of his washbowl. \"I'll bet a big red apple against a turnip that  I'm down first,\" and he began to don his uniform with remarkable  rapidity.    All of the students were soon below, and then the various companies  marched into the messroom for their last breakfast at the Hall for some  time to come.    \"I see the wagons have already left,\" said Sam.    \"Yes, the drivers are to get the camp in readiness for to-night,\"  answered his big brother.    Knowing that they had a long march before them, the majority of the  cadets ate a hearty breakfast. Mrs. Green, the housekeeper, was sorry  to have them leave, and had prepared an unusually fine repast.    \"Mrs. Green is just all right,\" declared Tom. \"I move we give her a  vote of thanks.\" And this was later on done, much to the old lady's  delight.    It was a perfect day. The sun shone brightly, and there was just enough  breeze to keep the atmosphere fresh and exhilarating. Captain Putnam  was to accompany the students on horseback, and the teachers had  already gone off with the wagons.    \"Battalion, attention!\" shouted Major Larry Colby, when the cadets were  assembled on the parade ground. And the order was immediately obeyed.    \"Shoulder arms!\" was the next order given, and up went every gun in  unison. The movement was so pretty that the spectators who had gathered  to see the boys march off clapped their hands in approval.    \"Forward--march!\" came next, and the drums and fifes struck up, and  away went the cadets, company front, toward the road.    \"By column of fours!\" was the next command, and Captain Dick Rover  turned to his company.    \"By column of fours!\" he repeated, and Company A broke up into four  abreast and turned into the road leading off in the direction of Pine  Island. The other companies also broke up, and in a minute more the  cadets were really and truly on the march for the camp.    The drums and fifes sounded well on that bracing morning air, and quite  a crowd of boys and not a few girls followed the students over the  first of the hills back of Putnam Hall. But here the crowd dropped  gradually away, until the young soldiers had the country road  practically to themselves.    For a full mile the cadets were made to keep in step. Then came the  order, \"Route step!\" and they moved forward as pleased them, keeping  together, however, by companies. The route step is given that one may  take the step that is most natural to him, be it longer or shorter than  the regulation step.    Farms were rather scattered in that neighborhood, but occasionally  they passed country homes, when all the folks would rush forth to learn  what the drumming and fifing meant.    \"They are the Putnam Hall cadets,\" said one farm woman. \"How neat they  look and how nicely they march!\"    \"Puts me in mind o' war times, Mirandy,\" said her husband. \"Don't you  remember how the boys marched away in them days\"?    \"Indeed I do, Ira,\" answered the woman. \"But that was real, while this  is only for fun.\"    \"Well, I reckon some o' those lads would make putty good soldiers, were  they put to it. They handle their guns like veterans.\"    The cadets marched until ten o'clock and then stopped for a brief rest  near a fine hillside spring, where all procured a drink. Then they  moved forward again until noon, when they reached a small village where  dinner already awaited them.    \"We have covered twelve miles,\" said Captain Putnam. \"Eight more, and  the day's march will be over.\"    The cadets were glad enough to eat their dinner and take it easy on the  porch of the old country hotel at which they had stopped.    \"Imagine us marching off to war,\" observed Sam. \"How would you like it,  Tom\"?    \"Oh, I don't think I would complain,\" was the answer. \"Anything for a  bit of excitement.\"    The day's march was completed long before sundown, and the battalion  came to a halt in an open field through which flowed a shaded brook.    The tents were at hand and the students lost no time in putting up the  shelters.    Food was supplied for the occasion by a farmer living near, for it was  not deemed advisable to unload the cook stoves and build the necessary  fires.    The farmer gave the students permission to visit his apple orchard, and  this the majority did, returning to the temporary camp with their  pockets fairly bulging with apples.    The weather remained clear and warm, so the first night in the open  proved very agreeable. A camp-fire was lit just for the look of things,  and around this the cadets gathered, telling stories and singing songs  until it was time to turn in.    Sleeping in a tent just suited the Rover boys and none of them awoke  until sunrise. Soon the whole camp was astir, and each cadet took a  good washing up at the brook. Breakfast was supplied by the farmer,  and by nine o'clock the column was once again in motion on its way to  Pine Island.    \"Dot sleeping out in der air vos a funny dings,\" said Hans "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#13)"],[1,"rs, but also in themselves. It is, unfortunately, not seldom true  that justice is not administered so wisely and patiently in the  burning summer heat as it is at other times. In adjudicating on  criminal cases in the sultry weather, magistrates and judges would do  well to remember that cosmical influences are not without their effect  on human judgments, and that precipitate decisions, or decisions based  upon momentary irritation, or decisions, the severity of which they  may afterwards regret, are to some extent the result of those  influences. The same caution is applicable to those who have to deal  with convicted men; it should be remembered by them that in summer  their tempers are more easily tried, while they have at the same time  more to try them; and the knowledge of these facts should keep them on  the alert against themselves.    While increased temperature undoubtedly decreases personal  responsibility, it is a most difficult matter to decide whether this  factor ought to be taken into consideration when passing sentence on  criminal offenders. It is much more truly an extenuating circumstance  than the majority of pleas which receive the name. In a variety of  cases, such, for instance, as threats, assaults, manslaughter, murder,  a high temperature unquestionably sometimes enters as a determining  factor into the complex set of influences which produce these crimes.  But the first difficulty confronting a judge, who endeavours to take  such a factor into account, will he the difficulty of discovering  whether it was present or not in the individual case he has before  him. In reply to this objection it may be urged, and urged too with  considerable truth, that this hindrance is not insuperable. It is  possible to overcome it by noting whether the case in question stands  alone, or whether it is only one among a group of others taking place  about the same period. Should it turn out to be a case that stands  alone, it would be fair to assume that temperature is not a cause  requiring to be taken into consideration in dealing with the offender.  Should it, on the contrary, turn out to be one in a group of cases, it  would be equally fair to assume that temperature was not without its  effect in determining the action of the offender.    Having got thus far, having isolated temperature from among the other  causes, and having fixed upon it as the most potent of them all, what  would immediately and imperatively follow? As a matter of course it  would ensue that a person whose deeds are powerfully influenced by  the action of temperature is to that extent irresponsible for them.  To arrive at such a conclusion is equivalent to saying that such a  person, if his offences are at all serious, constitutes a grave  peril to society. In a sense, he may be less criminal, but he is  certainty more dangerous; and as the supreme duty of society is  self-preservation, such a person must be dealt with solely from that  point of view. It would be ridiculous to let him off because he is  largely irresponsible; his irresponsibility is just what constitutes  his danger, and is the very reason he should be subjected to prolonged  restraint.    In all offences of a trivial character presumably springing to a large  extent from the action of temperature, it might be wise if the  offender were only punished in such a way as would keep alive in his  memory a vivid recollection of the offence. This method of punishment  is better effected by a short and sharp term of imprisonment than by  inflicting a longer sentence and making the prison treatment  comparatively mild. A short, sharp sentence of this character has also  another advantage which is well worth attention. In many cases the  offender is the bread-winner of the home. The misery which follows his  prolonged imprisonment is often heartrending; the home has to be sold  up bit by bit; the mother has to strip off most of her scanty garments  and becomes, a piteous spectacle of starvation and rags, the  childrens' things have to go to the pawnshop; and it is fortunate if  one or two of the family does not die before the husband is released.  The misery which crime brings upon the innocent is the saddest of its  features, and whatever society can do consistently with its own  welfare to shorten or mitigate that misery, ought, in the interests of  our common humanity, to be done.    One word with reference to offences which do not come within the  cognisance of the criminal law. I do not know if there are any  statistics to show that, in schools, in workshops, in the army, or,  indeed, in any industry or institution where bodies of people are  massed together under one common head--there are more cases of  insubordination and more offences against discipline when the  temperature is high than in ordinary circumstances. But, whether such  a statistical record exists or not, there can be little doubt that  cases of refractory conduct prevail most largely in the warm season.  It would therefore be well if this fact were borne in mind by all  persons whose duty it is to enforce discipline and require obedience.  Considering that there are certain cosmical influences at work, which  make it note difficult for the ordinary human being to submit to  discipline, it might not be inexpedient, in certain cases, to take  these unusual conditions into account and not to enforce in their full  rigour all the penalties involved in a breach of rules. It is a  universal experience that many things which can ordinarily be done  without fatigue or trouble, become, at times, a burden and a source of  irritation. Some physical disturbance is at the root of this change,  and a similar disturbance is also at the root of the defective  standard of conduct which a high temperature almost invariably  succeeds in producing among some sections of the community.          CHAPTER IV.    DESTITUTION AND CRIME.      Under this heading I shall discuss some of the more important social  factors which either directly or indirectly tend to produce crime. It  will be impossible to discuss them all. The action of society upon the  individual is so complex, its effects are so varied, in many instances  so impalpable, that we must content ourselves with a survey of those  social phenomena which are most generally credited with leading up to  acts of delinquency.    It is very commonly believed that destitution is a powerful factor in  the production of crime; we shall therefore start upon this inquiry by  considering the extent to which destitution is responsible for  offences against person and property. A definition of what is meant by  destitution will assist in clearing the ground. It is a definition  which is not at all difficult to formulate; one destitute person is  remarkably like another, and what applies to one applies with a  considerable degree of accuracy to all. We shall, therefore, define a  destitute person as a person who is without house or home, who has no  work, who is able and willing to work but can get none, and has  nothing but starvation staring him in the face. Is any serious amount  of crime due to the desperation of people in a position such as this?  In order to answer this question it is necessary, in the first place,  to ask what kind of crime such persons will be most likely to commit.  It is most improbable that they will be crimes against the person,  such as homicide or assault; it will not be drunkenness, because, on  the assumption of their destitution, they will possess no money to  spend. In short, the offences a person in a state of destitution is  most likely to commit are begging and theft. What proportion of the  total volume of crime is due to these two offense? This is the first  question we shall have to answer. The second is, to what extent are  begging and theft the results of destitution? An adequate elucidation  of these two points will supply a satisfactory explanation of the part  played by destitution in the production of crime.    The total number of cases tried in England and Wales either summarily  or on indictment during the year 1887-88 amounted to 726,698. Out of  this total eight per cent. were cases of offences against property  excluding cases of malicious damage, and seven per cent. consisted of  offences against the Vagrancy Acts. Putting these two classes of  offences together we arrive at the result that out of a total number  of crimes of all kinds committed in England and Wales, 15 per cent.  may conceivably be due to destitution. This is a very serious  percentage, and if it actually represented the number of persons who  commit crime from sheer want of the elementary necessaries of life,  the confession would have to be made that the economic condition of  the country was deplorable. But is it a fact that destitution in the  sense we have been using the word is the cause of all these offences?  This is the next question we have to solve, and the answer springing  from it will reveal the true position of the case.    Let us deal first with offences against property. As has just been  pointed out these constitute eight per cent. of the annual amount of  crime. But according to inquiries which I have made, one half of the  annual number of offenders against property, so far from being in a  state of destitution, were actually at work, and earning wages at the  time of their arrest. Nor in this surprising. The daily newspapers  have only to be consulted to confirm it. In a very great number of  instances the records of criminal proceedings testify to the fact that  the person charged is in some way or other defrauding his employer,  and when these cases are deducted from the total of offences against  property, it considerably lessons the percentage of persons driven by  destitution into the ranks of crime. Add to these the great bulk of  juvenile offenders convicted of theft, and that peculiar class of  people who steal, not because"]]]
