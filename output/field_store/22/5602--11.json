(#13)"],[1,"were destitute of employment, she encouraged Sir William to  collect these artificers together, who accordingly embarked with his  little colony at one of the ports in Normandy; but in this expedition  he was likewise unfortunate; for before the vessel was clear of the  French coast, she was met by one of the Parliament ships of war, and  carried into the Isle of Wight, where our disappointed projector was  sent close prisoner to Cowes Castle, and there had leisure enough, and  what is more extraordinary, wanted not inclination to resume his  heroic poem, and having written about half the third book, in a very  gloomy prison, he thought proper to stop short again, finding himself,  as he imagined under the very shadow of death. Upon this occasion it  is reported of Davenant, that he wrote a letter to Hobbes, in which he  gives some account of the progress he made in the third book of  Gondibert, and offers some criticisms upon the nature of that kind of  poetry; but why, says he, should I trouble you or myself, with these  thoughts, when I am pretty certain I shall be hanged next week. This  gaiety of temper in Davenant, while he was in the most deplorable  circumstances of distress, carries something in it very singular, and  perhaps could proceed from no other cause but conscious innocence; for  he appears to have been an inoffensive good natured man. He was  conveyed from the Isle of Wight to the Tower of London, and for some  time his life was in the utmost hazard; nor is it quite certain by  what means he was preserved from falling a sacrifice to the prevailing  fury. Some conjecture that two aldermen of York, to whom he had been  kind when they were prisoners, interposed their influence for him;  others more reasonably conjecture that Milton was his friend, and  prevented the utmost effects of party rage from descending on the head  of this son of the muses. But by whatever means his life was saved, we  find him two years after a prisoner of the Tower, where he obtained  some indulgence by the favour of the Lord Keeper Whitlocke; upon  receiving which he wrote him a letter of thanks, which as it serves to  illustrate how easily and politely he wrote in prose, we shall here  insert. It is far removed either from meanness or bombast, and has as  much elegance in it as any letters in our language.      My Lord,    \"I am in suspense whether I should present my thankfulness to your  lordship for my liberty of the Tower, because when I consider how much  of your time belongs to the public, I conceive that to make a request  to you, and to thank you afterwards for the success of it, is to give  you no more than a succession of trouble; unless you are resolved to  be continually patient, and courteous to afflicted men, and agree in  your judgment with the late wise Cardinal, who was wont to say, If he  had not spent as much time in civilities, as in business, he had  undone his master. But whilst I endeavour to excuse this present  thankfulness, I should rather ask your pardon, for going about to make  a present to you of myself; for it may argue me to be incorrigible,  that, after so many afflictions, I have yet so much ambition, as to  desire to be at liberty, that I may have more opportunity to obey your  lordship's commands, and shew the world how much    \"I am,    \"My Lord,      \"Your lordship's most        \"Obliged, most humble,          \"And obedient servant,              \"Wm. Davenant.\"    Our author was so far happy as to obtain by this letter the favour of  Whitlocke, who was, perhaps, a man of more humanity and gentleness of  disposition, than some other of the covenanters. He at last obtained  his liberty entirely, and was delivered from every thing but the  narrowness of his circumstances, and to redress these, encouraged by  the interest of his friends, he likewise made a bold effort. He was  conscious that a play-house was entirely inconsistent with the  gloominess, and severity of these times; and yet he was certain that  there were people of taste enough in town, to fill one, if such a  scheme could be managed; which he conducted with great address, and at  last brought to bear, as he had the countenance of lord Whitlocke, Sir  John Maynard, and other persons of rank, who really were ashamed of  the cant and hypocrisy which then prevailed. In consequence of this,  our poet opened a kind of theatre at Rutland House, where several  pieces were acted, and if they did not gain him reputation, they  procured him what is more solid, and what he then more wanted, money.  Some of the people in power, it seems, were lovers of music, and tho'  they did not care to own it, they were wise enough to know that there  was nothing scandalous or immoral in the diversions of the theatre.  Sir William therefore, when he applied for a permission called what he  intended to represent an opera; but when he brought it on the stage,  it appeared quite another thing, which when printed had the following  title:    First day's entertainment at Rutland House by declamation and music,  after the manner of the ancients.    This being an introductory piece, it demanded all the author's wit to  make it answer different intentions; for first it was to be so  pleasing as to gain applause; and next it was to be be so remote from  the very appearance of a play, as not to give any offence to that  pretended sanctity that was then in fashion. It began with music, then  followed a prologue, in which the author rallies the oddity of his own  performance. The curtain being drawn up to the sound of slow and  solemn music, there followed a grave declamation by one in a guilded  rostrum, who personated Diogenes, and shewed the use and excellency of  dramatic entertainments. The second part of the entertainment  consisted of two lighter declamations; the first by a citizen of  Paris, who wittily rallies the follies of London; the other by a  citizen of London, who takes the same liberty with Paris and its  inhabitants. To this was tacked a song, and after that came a short  epilogue. The music was composed by Dr. Coleman, Capt. Cook, Mr. Henry  Laws, and Mr. George Hudson.    There were several other pieces which Sir William introduced upon this  stage of the same kind, which met with as much success, as could be  expected from the nature of the performances themselves, and the  temper and disposition of the audience. Being thus introduced, he at  last grew a little bolder, and not only ventured to write, but to act  several new plays, which were also somewhat in a new taste; that is,  they were more regular in their structure, and the language generally  speaking, smoother, and more correct than the old tragedies. These  improvements were in a great measure owing to Sir William's long  residence in France, which gave him an opportunity of reading their  best writers, and hearing the sentiments of their ablest critics upon  dramatic entertainments, where they were as much admired and  encouraged, as at that time despised in England. That these were  really improvements, and that the public stood greatly indebted to Sir  William Davenant as a poet, and master of a theatre, we can produce no  less an authority than that of Dryden, who, beyond any of his  predecessors, contemporaries, or those who have succeeded him,  understood poetry as an art. In his essay on heroic plays, he thus  speaks, \"The first light we had of them, on the English theatre (says  he) was from Sir William Davenant. It being forbidden him in the  religious times to act tragedies or comedies, because they contained  some matter of scandal to those good people, who could more easily  dispossess their lawful sovereign, than endure a wanton jest, he was  forced to turn his thoughts another way, and to introduce the examples  of moral virtue written in verse, and performed in recitative music.  The original of this music, and of the scenes which adorned his works,  he had from the Italian opera's; but he heightened his characters, as  I may probably imagine, from the examples of Corneille, and some  French poets. In this condition did this part of poetry remain at his  Majelty's return, when grown bolder as now owned by public authority,  Davenant revived the Siege of Rhodes, and caused it to be acted as a  just drama. But as few men have the happiness to begin and finish any  new project, so neither did he live to make his design perfect. There  wanted the fulness of a plot, and the variety of characters to form it  as it ought; and perhaps somewhat might have been added to the beauty  of the stile: all which he would have performed with more exactness,  had he pleased to have given us another work of the fame nature. For  myself and others who came after him, we are bound with all veneration  to his memory, to acknowledge what advantage we received from that  excellent ground work, which is laid, and since it is an easy thing to  add to what is already invented, we ought all of us, without envy to  him, or partiality to ourselves, to yield him the precedence in it.\"    Immediately after the restoration there were two companies of players  formed, one under the title of the King's Servants, the other, under  that of the Duke's Company, both by patents, from the crown; the first  granted to Henry Killigrew, Esq; and the latter to Sir William  Davenant. The King's company acted first at the Red Bull in the upper  end of St. John's Street, and after a year or two removing from place  to place, they established themselves in Drury-Lane. It was some time  before Sir William Davenant compleated his company, into which he took  all who had formerly played under Mr. Rhodes in the Cock-Pit in  Drury-Lane, and amongst these the famous Mr. Betterton, who appeared  first to advantage under the patronage of Sir William Davenant. He  opened the Duke's theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields with his own  dramatic performance of the Siege of Rhodes, the house being finely  decorated, and the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16494"],[0,"The Transvaal from Within: A Private Record of Public Affairs (#13)"],[1,"ions, they are frequently considered to be wanting in personal  courage. It seems a hard thing to say of a people who have produced  men like the first Bezuidenhout, who fought and died single-handed  against the British troops; men like Piet Retief, as gallant a man as  ever walked; men like Piet Uys, an example to all men for all time,  and only one of many generations in one family of equally gallant  Dutchmen; but it would truly seem that such examples do not occur  with such frequency among the Boers as among nations with whom they  have been compared. Where they have been able to choose their own  positions, or where they have been stimulated by previous successes,  they have done all that could possibly be asked of them; but their  particular military system does not conduce to success under  circumstances where men are suddenly and unexpectedly called upon to  exhibit the virtues of discipline, to make what to the individual may  appear a useless sacrifice of life, or, in cold blood and in the face  of previous defeat, to attempt to retrieve a lost position.    The Boer military power has been called the biggest unpricked bubble  in the world. Whether this be so or not--whether the early conflicts  between the British troops and the Boers in the Cape Colony and Natal  justify the view that the Boers cannot take a beating and come up  again--is a matter for those to decide who will give their impartial  attention to the records.    Whilst conspicuous personal daring among the Boers may not be  proverbial, it must be remembered to their everlasting credit that  they, as did the Southerners in the American Civil War, robbed the  cradle and the grave to defend their country. Boys who were mere  children bore rifles very nearly as long as themselves; old men, who  had surely earned by a life of hardship and exposure an immunity from  such calls, jumped on their horses and rode without hesitation and  without provision to fight for their independence.    There were, however, unfortunately, matters connected with the war  which gave birth to a bitter and aching desire for revenge.  Bronkhorst Spruit and the murder of Captain Elliott were among the  earliest. Another was the shooting of Dr. Barbour (who was killed  instantly) and Mr. Walter Dyas (wounded) by their escort under  circumstances similar to those of the Elliott murder, with the  exception that in this case the prisoners had been released on foot  and in daylight, and were then shot down.    But there were others too. There was the murder of Green in  Lydenburg, who was called to the Boer camp, where he went unarmed and  in good faith, only to have his brains blown out by the Boer with  whom he was conversing; there was the public flogging of another  Englishman by the notorious Abel Erasmus because he was an Englishman  and had British sympathies; and there were the various white flag  incidents. At Ingogo the Boers raised the white flag, and when in  response to this General Colley ordered the hoisting of a similar  flag to indicate that it was seen, a perfect hail of lead was poured  on the position where the General stood; and it was obvious that the  hoisting of the flag was merely a ruse to ascertain where the General  and his staff were. There was the ambulance affair on Majuba, when  the Boers came upon an unarmed party bearing the wounded with the red  cross flying over them, and after asking who they were and getting a  reply, fired a volley into the group, killing Surgeon-Major Cornish.  under Commandant Cronje were guilty of actions contrary to the usages  of civilized warfare. They are matters of history, and can easily be  verified. Reference is made to them elsewhere in this volume in  connection with Commandant Cronje's action on another occasion.    And so the war left the country, as wars will, divided into two  parties, with feelings towards each other that are deplorable enough  in themselves, and not easily allayed. The curtain was rung down, and  the scene was lost to the view of the world, but the play went on all  the same behind the curtain. And this is what the new Government said  to the world on August 8, 1881, when they took over the  administration of the country:    To all inhabitants, without exception, we promise the protection of  the law, and all the privileges attendant thereon.    To inhabitants who are not burghers, and do not wish to become such,  we notify that they have the right to report themselves to the  Resident as British subjects, according to Article 28 of the now  settled Convention. But be it known to all, that all ordinary rights  of property, trade, and usages will still be accorded to everyone,  burgher or not.    We repeat solemnly that our motto is, 'Unity and reconciliation.'      Footnotes for Chapter I    {01} Written in 1896.    {02} Several of the letters and despatches given in this volume are  quoted from Mr. Martineau's excellent 'Life of Sir Bartle Frere,' a  portion of which book was lately published in cheaper form, under  the title of 'The Transvaal Trouble and How it Arose.'    {03} It is only fair to state that _at that time_ the Home Government  believed the prestige of the Imperial authority to be sufficient for  all purposes.          CHAPTER II    AFTER THE WAR      In 1882 Sir Bartle Frere wrote, 'I have never been able to discover  any principle in our policy in South Africa except that of giving way  whenever any difficulty or opposition is encountered.' The remark is  still as true as when it was penned, and South Africa--the 'Grave of  Reputations,'{04} as it has long been called--must by this time be  regarded with doubtful emotions by successive Colonial Secretaries.  What is it about South Africa, one asks, that has upset so many men  of capacity and experience? Who can say? Often--most often--it is the  neglect to thoroughly study and know what are called the 'local  conditions,' and to pay due heed to local experience. Sometimes it is  the subordination of State policy to party considerations which has  ruined the Proconsul: witness Sir Bartle Frere, whose decisive  action, firm character, and wise and statesmanlike policy are  now--now that he is dead--recognised universally, as they have always  been in South Africa. Perhaps there is something in Africa itself  which makes it a huge exception to the rules of other lands; the  something which is suggested in the 'rivers without water, flowers  without scent, and birds without song'; a contrariness which puts the  alluvial gold on the top of mountain ranges and leaves the valleys  barren; which mocked the experience of the world, and showed the  waterworn gravel deposit to be the biggest, richest, deepest, and  most reliable gold reef ever known; which placed diamonds in such  conditions that the greatest living authority, who had undertaken a  huge journey to report on the occurrence, could only say, in the face  of a successful wash-up, 'Well, there _may_ be diamonds here, but all  I can say is they've no right to be'; the something which many, many  centuries ago prompted the old Roman to write, 'Ex Africa semper  aliquid novi affert,' and which is in the mind of the South African  to-day when he says, 'The impossible is always happening in Africa.'    There is this to be said for the Gladstone Ministry in 1881: that,  having decided on a policy of scuttle and abandonment, they did it  thoroughly, as though they enjoyed it. A feeble vote-catching  provision, with no security attached, was inserted in the Pretoria  Convention relative to the treatment of natives, but no thought or  care was given to the unfortunate British subject who happened to be  a white man, and to have fought for his Queen and country.{05} The  abandonment was complete, without scruple, without shame. It has been  written that 'the care and forethought which would be lavished on a  favourite horse or dog on changing masters were denied to British  subjects by the British Government.' The intensity and bitterness of  the resentment, the wrath and hatred--so much deeper because so  impotent--at the betrayal and desertion have left their traces on  South African feeling; and the opinion of the might and honour of  England, as it may be gleaned in many parts of the Colonies as well  as everywhere in the Republics, would be an unpleasant revelation to  those who live in undisturbed portions of the Empire, comfortable in  the belief that to be a British subject carries the old-time magic of  'Civis Romanus sum.'    The Transvaal State, as it was now to be called, was re-established,  having had its trade restored, its enemies crushed--for Secocoeni and  Cetewayo were both defeated and broken--and its debts paid or  consolidated in the form of a debt to England, repayable when  possible. For some time not even the interest on this debt was paid.    Numbers of British subjects left the country in disgust and despair.  Ruined in pocket and broken in spirit, they took what little they  could realize of their once considerable possessions, and left the  country where they could no longer live and enjoy the rights of free  men. For some years the life of a Britisher among the Boers was far  from happy. It is not surprising--indeed, not unnatural--that people  unsoftened by education and the conditions of civilization, moved by  fierce race prejudice, and intoxicated by unbroken and unexpected  success, should in many cases make the vanquished feel the  conqueror's heel. The position of men of British name or sympathies  in the country districts was very serious, and the injustice done to  those who had settled since the annexation, believing that they were  to live under the laws and protection of their own Government was  grave indeed.    The Government of the country was vested in a Triumvirate with Mr.  Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger as Vice-President during the period  immediately following the war; but in 1882 the old form was restored  and Mr."]]]
