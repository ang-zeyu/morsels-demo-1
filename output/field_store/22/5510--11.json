By far the majority were the almost naked natives of the  district, pleasant, brown-skinned people with good features. They  carried things. These things varied from great loads balanced atop to  dainty impromptu baskets woven of cocoa-leaves and containing each a  single cocoanut. They smiled on us, returned our greeting, and stood  completely aside to let us pass. Other wayfarers were of more  importance. Small groups of bearded dignitaries, either upper-class  Swahili or pure Arabs, strolled slowly along, apparently with limitless  leisure, but evidently bound somewhere, nevertheless. They replied to  our greetings with great dignity. Once, also, we overtook a small  detachment of Sudanese troops moving. They were scattered over several  miles of road. A soldier, most impressive and neat in khaki and red  tarboosh and sash; then two or three of his laughing, sleek women, clad  in the thin, patterned \"'Mericani,\" glittering with gold ornaments; then  a half dozen ragged porters carrying official but battered painted  wooden kit boxes, or bags, or miscellaneous curious plunder; then more  troopers; and so on for miles. They all drew aside for us most  respectfully; and the soldiers saluted, very smart and military.    Under the broad-spreading mangoes near the villages we came upon many  open markets in full swing. Each vendor squatted on his heels behind his  wares, while the purchasers or traders wandered here and there making  offers. The actual commerce compared with the amount of laughing,  joking, shrieking joy of the occasion as one to a thousand.    Generally three or four degenerate looking dirty East Indians slunk  about, very crafty, very insinuating, very ready and skilful to take  what advantages they could. I felt a strong desire to kick every one of  them out from these joyful concourses of happy people. Generally we sat  down for a while in these markets, and talked to the people a little,  and perhaps purchased some of the delicious fruit. They had a small  delicate variety of banana, most wonderful, the like of which I have  seen nowhere else. We bought forty of these for a coin worth about eight  cents. Besides fruit they offered cocoanuts in all forms, grain, woven  baskets, small articles of handicraft--and fish. The latter were farther  from the sea than they should have been! These occasional halts greatly  refreshed us for more of that endless road.    For all this time we were very hot. As the sun mounted, the country  fairly steamed. From the end of my rifle barrel, which I carried across  my forearm, a steady trickle of water dripped into the road. We neither  of us had a dry stitch on us, and our light garments clung to us  thoroughly wet through. At first we tried the military method, and  marched fifty minutes to rest ten, but soon discovered that twenty-five  minutes' work to five minutes off was more practical. The sheer weight  of the sun was terrific; after we had been exposed to it for any great  length of time--as across several wide open spaces--we entered the  steaming shade of the jungle with gratitude. At the end of seven hours,  however, we most unexpectedly came through a dense cocoanut grove plump  on the banks of the harbour at Kilindini.    Here, after making arrangements for the transport of our safari, when it  should arrive, we entrusted ourselves to a small boy and a cranky boat.  An hour later, clad in tropical white, with cool drinks at our elbows,  we sat in easy-chairs on the veranda of the Mombasa Club.    The clubhouse is built on a low cliff at the water's edge. It looks  across the blue waters of the bay to a headland crowned with  cocoa-palms, and beyond the headland to the Indian Ocean. The cool  trades sweep across that veranda. We idly watched a lone white oarsman  pulling strongly against the wind through the tide rips, evidently bent  on exercise. We speculated on the incredible folly of wanting exercise;  and forgot him. An hour later a huge saffron yellow squall rose from  China 'cross the way, filled the world with an unholy light, lashed the  reluctant sea to white-caps, and swooped screaming on the cocoa-palms.  Police boats to rescue the idiot oarsman! Much minor excitement! Great  rushing to and fro! We continued to sit in our lounging chairs, one hand  on our cool long drinks.    FOOTNOTES:    [4] For a fuller discussion, see \"The Land of Footprints.\"          XII.    THE FIRE.      We were very tired, so we turned in early. W Unfortunately, our rooms  were immediately over the billiard room, where a bibulous and  cosmopolitan lot were earnestly endeavouring to bolster up by further  proof the fiction that a white man cannot retain his health in the  tropics. The process was pretty rackety, and while it could not keep us  awake, it prevented us from falling thoroughly asleep. At length, and  suddenly, the props of noise fell away from me, and I sank into a  grateful, profound abyss.    Almost at once, however, I was dragged back to consciousness. Mohammed  stood at my bedside.    \"Bwana,\" he proffered to my rather angry inquiry, \"all the people have  gone to the fire. It is a very large fire. I thought you would like to  see it.\"    I glanced out of the window at the reddening sky, thrust my feet into a  pair of slippers, and went forth in my pyjamas to see what I could see.    We threaded our way through many narrow dark and deserted streets,  beneath balconies that overhung, past walls over which nodded tufted  palms, until a loud and increasing murmuring told us we were nearing the  centre of disturbance. Shortly, we came to the outskirts of the excited  crowd, and beyond them saw the red furnace glow.    \"Semeelay! Semeelay!\" warned Mohammed authoritatively; and the  bystanders, seeing a white face, gave me passage.    All of picturesque Mombasa was afoot--Arabs, Swahilis, Somalis, savages,  Indians--the whole lot. They moved restlessly in the narrow streets;  they hung over the edges of balconies; they peered from barred windows;  interested dark faces turned up everywhere in the flickering light. One  woman, a fine, erect, biblical figure, stood silhouetted on a flat  housetop and screamed steadily. I thought she must have at least one  baby in the fire, but it seems she was only excited.    The fire was at present confined to two buildings, in which it was  raging fiercely. Its spread, however, seemed certain; and, as it was  surrounded by warehouses of valuable goods, moving was in full swing. A  frantic white man stood at the low doorway of one of these dungeon-like  stores hastening the movements of an unending string of porters. As each  emerged bearing a case on his shoulder, the white man urged him to a  trot. I followed up the street to see where these valuables were being  taken, and what were the precautions against theft. Around the next  corner, it seemed. As each excited perspiring porter trotted up, he  heaved his burden from his head or his shoulders, and promptly scampered  back for another load. They were loyal and zealous men; but their  headpieces were deficient inside. For the burdens that they saved from  the fire happened to be cases of gin in bottles. At least, it was in  bottles until the process of saving had been completed. Then it trickled  merrily down the gutter. I went back and told the frantic white man  about it. He threw up both hands to heaven and departed.    By dodging from street to street Mohammed and I succeeded in circling  the whole disturbance, and so came at length to a public square. Here  was a vast throng, and a very good place, so I climbed atop a rescued  bale of cotton the better to see.    Mombasa has no water system, but a wonderful corps of water-carriers.  These were in requisition to a man. They disappeared down through the  wide gates of the customs enclosure, their naked, muscular, light-brown  bodies gleaming with sweat, their Standard Oil cans dangling merrily at  the ends of slender poles. A moment later they emerged, the cans full of  salt water from the bay, the poles seeming fairly to butt into their  bare shoulders as they teetered along at their rapid, swaying, burdened  gait.    The moment they entered the square they were seized upon from a dozen  different sides. There was no system at all. Every owner of property was  out for himself, and intended to get as much of the precious water as he  could. The poor carriers were pulled about, jerked violently here and  there, besought, commanded, to bring their loads to one or the other of  the threatened premises. Vociferations, accusations, commands arose to  screams. One old graybeard occupied himself by standing on tiptoe and  screeching, \"Maji! maji! maji!\" at the top of his voice, as though that  added anything to the visible supply. The water-carrier of the moment  disappeared in a swirl of excited contestants. He was attending strictly  to business, looking neither to right nor to left, pushing forward as  steadily as he could, gasping mechanically his customary warning,  \"Semeelay! Semeelay!\" Somehow, eventually, he and his comrades must have  got somewhere; for after an interval he returned with empty buckets.  Then every blessed fool of a property owner took a whack at his bare  shoulders as he passed, shrieking hysterically, \"Haya! haya! pesi!  pesi!\" and the like to men already doing their best. It was a grand  sight!    In the meantime the fire itself was roaring away. The old graybeard  suddenly ceased crying \"maji,\" and darted forward to where I stood on  the bale of cotton. With great but somewhat flurried respect he begged  me to descend. I did so, somewhat curious as to what he might be up to,  for the cotton was at least two hundred feet from the fire. Immediately  he began to tug and heave; the bale was almost beyond his strength; but  after incredible exertions he lifted one side of it, poised it for a  moment, got his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14460"],[0,"Faust: a Tragedy [part 1], Translated from the German of Goethe (#13)"],[1," wicked _one_, but not the wicked _ones_, has vanished.  Herr Baron callst thou me, then all is right and good;  I am a cavalier, like others. Doubt me?  Doubt for a moment of my noble blood?  See here the family arms I bear about me!       [_He makes an indecent gesture.]    The witch [laughs immoderately_]. Ha! ha! full well I know you, sir!  You are the same old rogue you always were!    _Mephistopheles [to Faust_]. I pray you, carefully attend,  This is the way to deal with witches, friend.    _The witch_. Now, gentles, what shall I produce?    _Mephistopheles_. A right good glassful of the well-known juice!  And pray you, let it be the oldest;  Age makes it doubly strong for use.    _The witch_. Right gladly! Here I have a bottle,  From which, at times, I wet my throttle;  Which now, not in the slightest, stinks;  A glass to you I don't mind giving;       [_Softly_.]  But if this man, without preparing, drinks,  He has not, well you know, another hour for living.    _Mephistopheles_.  'Tis a good friend of mine, whom it shall straight cheer up;  Thy kitchen's best to give him don't delay thee.  Thy ring--thy spell, now, quick, I pray thee,  And give him then a good full cup.    [_The_ WITCH, _with strange gestures, draws a circle, and places singular  things in it; mean-while the glasses begin to ring, the kettle to sound  and make music. Finally, she brings a great book and places the monkeys in  the circle, whom she uses as a reading-desk and to hold the torches. She  beckons_ FAUST _to come to her_.]    _Faust [to Mephistopheles_].  Hold! what will come of this? These creatures,  These frantic gestures and distorted features,  And all the crazy, juggling fluff,  I've known and loathed it long enough!    _Mephistopheles_. Pugh! that is only done to smoke us;  Don't be so serious, my man!  She must, as Doctor, play her hocus-pocus  To make the dose work better, that's the plan.        [_He constrains_ FAUST _to step into the circle_.]                THE WITCH        [_beginning with great emphasis to declaim out of the book_]          Remember then!        Of One make Ten,        The Two let be,        Make even Three,        There's wealth for thee.        The Four pass o'er!        Of Five and Six,         (The witch so speaks,)        Make Seven and Eight,        The thing is straight:        And Nine is One        And Ten is none--        This is the witch's one-time-one![24]    _Faust_. The old hag talks like one delirious.    _Mephistopheles_. There's much more still, no less mysterious,  I know it well, the whole book sounds just so!  I've lost full many a year in poring o'er it,  For perfect contradiction, you must know,  A mystery stands, and fools and wise men bow before it,  The art is old and new, my son.  Men, in all times, by craft and terror,  With One and Three, and Three and One,  For truth have propagated error.  They've gone on gabbling so a thousand years;  Who on the fools would waste a minute?  Man generally thinks, if words he only hears,  Articulated noise must have some meaning in it.    _The witch [goes on_]. Deep wisdom's power        Has, to this hour,        From all the world been hidden!        Whoso thinks not,        To him 'tis brought,        To him it comes unbidden.    _Faust_. What nonsense is she talking here?  My heart is on the point of cracking.  In one great choir I seem to hear  A hundred thousand ninnies clacking.    _Mephistopheles_. Enough, enough, rare Sibyl, sing us  These runes no more, thy beverage bring us,  And quickly fill the goblet to the brim;  This drink may by my friend be safely taken:  Full many grades the man can reckon,  Many good swigs have entered him.         [_The_ WITCH, _with many ceremonies, pours the drink into a cup;        as she puts it to_ FAUST'S _lips, there rises a light flame_.]    _Mephistopheles_. Down with it!  Gulp it down! 'Twill prove  All that thy heart's wild wants desire.  Thou, with the devil, hand and glove,[25]  And yet wilt be afraid of fire?         [_The_ WITCH _breaks the circle_; FAUST _steps out_.]    _Mephistopheles_. Now briskly forth! No rest for thee!    _The witch_. Much comfort may the drink afford you!    _Mephistopheles [to the witch_]. And any favor you may ask of me,  I'll gladly on Walpurgis' night accord you.    _The witch_. Here is a song, which if you sometimes sing,  'Twill stir up in your heart a special fire.    _Mephistopheles [to Faust_]. Only make haste; and even shouldst thou tire,  Still follow me; one must perspire,  That it may set his nerves all quivering.  I'll teach thee by and bye to prize a noble leisure,  And soon, too, shalt thou feel with hearty pleasure,  How busy Cupid stirs, and shakes his nimble wing.    _Faust_. But first one look in yonder glass, I pray thee!  Such beauty I no more may find!    _Mephistopheles_. Nay! in the flesh thine eyes shall soon display thee  The model of all woman-kind.        [_Softly_.]  Soon will, when once this drink shall heat thee,  In every girl a Helen meet thee!                A STREET.          FAUST. MARGARET [_passing over_].    _Faust_. My fair young lady, will it offend her  If I offer my arm and escort to lend her?    _Margaret_. Am neither lady, nor yet am fair!  Can find my way home without any one's care.         [_Disengages herself and exit_.]    _Faust_. By heavens, but then the child _is_ fair!  I've never seen the like, I swear.  So modest is she and so pure,  And somewhat saucy, too, to be sure.  The light of the cheek, the lip's red bloom,  I shall never forget to the day of doom!  How me cast down her lovely eyes,  Deep in my soul imprinted lies;  How she spoke up, so curt and tart,  Ah, that went right to my ravished heart!         [_Enter_ MEPHISTOPHELES.]    _Faust_. Hark, thou shalt find me a way to address her!    _Mephistopheles_. Which one?    _Faust_. She just went by.    _Mephistopheles_. What! She?  She came just now from her father confessor,  Who from all sins pronounced her free;  I stole behind her noiselessly,  'Tis an innocent thing, who, for nothing at all,  Must go to the confessional;  O'er such as she no power I hold!    _Faust_. But then she's over fourteen years old.    _Mephistopheles_. Thou speak'st exactly like Jack Rake,  Who every fair flower his own would make.  And thinks there can be no favor nor fame,  But one may straightway pluck the same.  But 'twill not always do, we see.    _Faust_. My worthy Master Gravity,  Let not a word of the Law be spoken!  One thing be clearly understood,--  Unless I clasp the sweet, young blood  This night in my arms--then, well and good:  When midnight strikes, our bond is broken.    _Mephistopheles_. Reflect on all that lies in the way!  I need a fortnight, at least, to a day,  For finding so much as a way to reach her.    _Faust_. Had I seven hours, to call my own,  Without the devil's aid, alone  I'd snare with ease so young a creature.    _Mephistopheles_. You talk quite Frenchman-like to-day;  But don't be vexed beyond all measure.  What boots it thus to snatch at pleasure?  'Tis not so great, by a long way,  As if you first, with tender twaddle,  And every sort of fiddle-faddle,  Your little doll should mould and knead,  As one in French romances may read.    _Faust_. My appetite needs no such spur.    _Mephistopheles_. Now, then, without a jest or slur,  I tell you, once for all, such speed  With the fair creature won't succeed.  Nothing will here by storm be taken;  We must perforce on intrigue reckon.    _Faust_. Get me some trinket the angel has blest!  Lead me to her chamber of rest!  Get me a 'kerchief from her neck,  A garter get me for love's sweet sake!    _Mephistopheles_. To prove to you my willingness  To aid and serve you in this distress;  You shall visit her chamber, by me attended,  Before the passing day is ended.    _Faust_. And see her, too? and have her?    _Mephistopheles_. Nay!  She will to a neighbor's have gone away.  Meanwhile alone by yourself you may,  There in her atmosphere, feast at leisure  And revel in dreams of future pleasure.    _Faust_. Shall we start at once?    _Mephistopheles_. 'Tis too early yet.    _Faust_. Some present to take her for me you must get.          [_Exit_.]    _Mephistopheles_. Presents already! Brave! He's on the right foundation!  Full many a noble place I know,  And treasure buried long ago;  Must make a bit of exploration.          [_Exit_.]                EVENING.          _A little cleanly Chamber_.    MARGARET [_braiding and tying up her hair_.]  I'd give a penny just to say  What gentleman that was to-day!  How very gallant he seemed to be,  He's of a noble family;  That I could read from his brow and bearing--  And he would not have otherwise been so daring.        [_Exit_.]          FAUST. MEPHISTOPHELES.    _Mephistopheles_. Come in, step softly, do not fear!    _Faust [after a pause_]. Leave me alone, I prithee, here!    _Mephistopheles [peering round_]. Not every maiden keeps so neat.        [_Exit_.]    _Faust [gazing round_]. Welcome this hallowed still retreat!  Where twilight weaves its magic glow.  Seize on my heart, love-longing, sad and sweet,  That on the dew of hope dost feed thy woe!  How breathes around the sense of stillness,  Of quiet, order, and content!  In all this poverty what fulness!  What blessedness within this prison pent!        [_He throws himself into a leathern chair by the bed_.]  Take me, too! as thou hast, in years long flown,  In joy and grief, so many a generation!  Ah me! how oft, on this ancestral throne,  Have troops of children climbed with exultation!  Perhaps, when Christmas brought the Holy Guest,  My love has here, in grateful veneration  The grandsire's withered hand with child-lips prest.  I feel, O maiden, circling me,  Thy spirit of grace and fulness hover,  Which daily like a mother teaches thee  The table-cloth to spread in snowy purity,  And even, with crinkled sand the floor to cover.  Dear, godlike hand! a touch of thine  Makes this low"]]]
