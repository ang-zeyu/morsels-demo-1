In like  manner shouldst thou hearken unto the verses of the Bayan and acknowledge  its truth, only then would the revealed verses of God profit thee.  Otherwise what benefit canst thou derive therefrom? For wert thou to  prostrate thyself in adoration from the beginning of life till the end and  to spend thy days for the sake of God's remembrance, but disbelieve in the  Exponent of His Revelation for the age, dost thou imagine that thy deeds  would confer any benefit upon thee? On the other hand, if thou believest  in Him and dost recognize Him with true understanding, and He saith: 'I  have accepted thine entire life spent in My adoration', then assuredly  hast thou been worshipping Him most ardently. Thy purpose in performing  thy deeds is that God may graciously accept them; and divine acceptance  can in no wise be achieved except through the acceptance of Him Who is the  Exponent of His Revelation. For instance, if the Apostle of God--may divine  blessings rest upon Him--accepted a certain deed, in truth God accepted it;  otherwise it hath remained within the selfish desires of the person who  wrought it, and did not reach the presence of God. Likewise, any act which  is accepted by the Point of the Bayan is accepted by God, inasmuch as the  contingent world hath no other access unto the presence of the Ancient of  Days. Whatever is sent down cometh through the Exponent of His Revelation,  and whatever ascendeth, ascendeth unto the Exponent of His Revelation.  VIII, 19.          \"There is no doubt that the Almighty hath sent down ...\"      There is no doubt that the Almighty hath sent down these verses unto Him  [the Bab], even as He sent down unto the Apostle of God. Indeed no less  than a hundred thousand verses similar to these have already been  disseminated among the people, not to mention His Epistles, His Prayers or  His learned and philosophical treatises. He revealeth no less than a  thousand verses within the space of five hours. He reciteth verses at a  speed consonant with the capacity of His amanuensis to set them down.  Thus, it may well be considered that if from the inception of this  Revelation until now He had been left unhindered, how vast then would have  been the volume of writings disseminated from His pen.    If ye contend that these verses cannot, of themselves, be regarded as a  proof, scan the pages of the Qur'an. If God hath established therein any  evidence other than the revealed verses to demonstrate the validity of the  prophethood of His Apostle--may the blessings of God rest upon Him--ye may  then have your scruples about Him...    Concerning the sufficiency of the Book as a proof, God hath revealed: 'Is  it not enough for them that We have sent down unto Thee the Book to be  recited to them? In this verily is a mercy and a warning to those who  believe.'(60) When God hath testified that the Book is a sufficient  testimony, as is affirmed in the text, how can one dispute this truth by  saying that the Book in itself is not a conclusive proof?... II, 1.          \"Since that Day is a great Day it would be sorely trying ...\"      Since that Day is a great Day it would be sorely trying for thee to  identify thyself with the believers. For the believers of that Day are the  inmates of Paradise, while the unbelievers are the inmates of the fire.  And know thou of a certainty that by Paradise is meant recognition of and  submission unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, and by the fire the  company of such souls as would fail to submit unto Him or to be resigned  to His good-pleasure. On that Day thou wouldst regard thyself as the  inmate of Paradise and as a true believer in Him, whereas in reality thou  wouldst suffer thyself to be wrapt in veils and thy habitation would be  the nethermost fire, though thou thyself wouldst not be cognizant thereof.    Compare His manifestation with that of the Point of the Qur'an. How vast  the number of the Letters of the Gospel who eagerly expected Him, yet from  the time of His declaration up to five years no one became an inmate of  Paradise, except the Commander of the Faithful [Imam 'Ali], and those who  secretly believed in Him. All the rest were accounted as inmates of the  fire, though they considered themselves as dwellers in Paradise.    Likewise behold this Revelation. The essences of the people have, through  divinely-conceived designs, been set in motion and until the present day  three hundred and thirteen disciples have been chosen. In the land of Sad  [Isfahan], which to outward seeming is a great city, in every corner of  whose seminaries are vast numbers of people regarded as divines and  doctors, yet when the time came for inmost essences to be drawn forth,  only its sifter of wheat donned the robe of discipleship. This is the  mystery of what was uttered by the kindred of the Prophet Muhammad--upon  them be the peace of God--concerning this Revelation, saying that the  abased shall be exalted and the exalted shall be abased.    Likewise is the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Among  those to whom it will never occur that they might merit the displeasure of  God, and whose pious deeds will be exemplary unto everyone, there will be  many who will become the personification of the nethermost fire itself,  when they fail to embrace His Cause; while among the lowly servants whom  no one would imagine to be of any merit, how great the number who will be  honoured with true faith and on whom the Fountainhead of generosity will  bestow the robe of authority. For whatever is created in the Faith of God  is created through the potency of His Word. VIII, 14.          \"In the manifestation of the Apostle of God all were eagerly ...\"      In the manifestation of the Apostle of God all were eagerly awaiting Him,  yet thou hast heard how He was treated at the time of His appearance, in  spite of the fact that if ever they beheld Him in their dreams they would  take pride in them.    Likewise in the manifestation of the Point of the Bayan, the people stood  up at the mention of His Name and fervently implored His advent night and  day, and if they dreamt of Him they gloried in their dreams; yet now that  He hath revealed Himself, invested with the mightiest testimony, whereby  their own religion is vindicated, and despite the incalculable number of  people who yearningly anticipate His coming, they are resting comfortably  in their homes, after having hearkened to His verses; while He at this  moment is confined in the mountain of Maku, lonely and forsaken.    Take good heed of yourselves, O people of the Bayan, lest ye perform such  deeds as to weep sore for His sake night and day, to stand up at the  mention of His Name, yet on this Day of fruition--a Day whereon ye should  not only arise at His Name, but seek a path unto Him Who personifies that  Name--ye shut yourselves out from Him as by as veil. VI, 15.          \"At the time of the manifestation of Him Whom God ...\"      At the time of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest  everyone should be well trained in the teachings of the Bayan, so that  none of the followers may outwardly cling to the Bayan and thus forfeit  their allegiance unto Him. If anyone does so, the verdict of 'disbeliever  in God' shall be passed upon him.    I swear by the holy Essence of God, were all in the Bayan to unite in  helping Him Whom God shall make manifest in the days of His Revelation,  not a single soul, nay, not a created thing would remain on earth that  would not gain admittance into Paradise. Take good heed of yourselves, for  the sum total of the religion of God is but to help Him, rather than to  observe, in the time of His appearance, such deeds as are prescribed in  the Bayan. Should anyone, however, ere He manifesteth Himself, transgress  the ordinances, were it to the extent of a grain of barley, he would have  trangressed His command.    Seek ye refuge in God from whatsoever might lead you astray from the  Source of His Revelation and hold fast unto His Cord, for whoso holdeth  fast unto His allegiance, he hath attained and will attain salvation in  all the worlds.    'Such is the bounty of God; to whom He will, He giveth it, and God is the  Lord of grace abounding.'(61) V, 5.          \"Ye perform your works for God from the beginning of ...\"      Ye perform your works for God from the beginning of your lives till the  end thereof, yet not a single act is for the sake of Him Who is the  Manifestation of God, to Whom every good deed reverteth. Had ye acted in  such manner, ye would not have suffered so grievously on the Day of  Resurrection.    Behold how great is the Cause, and yet how the people are wrapt in veils.  I swear by the sanctified Essence of God that every true praise and deed  offered unto God is naught but praise and deed offered unto Him Whom God  shall make manifest.    Deceive not your own selves that you are being virtuous for the sake of  God when you are not. For should ye truly do your works for God, ye would  be performing them for Him Whom God shall make manifest and would be  magnifying His Name. The dwellers of this mountain who are bereft of true  understanding unceasingly utter the words, 'No God is there but God'; but  what benefit doth it yield them? Ponder awhile that ye may not be shut out  as by a veil from Him Who is the Dayspring of Revelation. VIII, 19.          \"God hath, at all times and under all conditions, been ...\"      God hath, at all times and under all conditions, been wholly independent  of His creatures. He hath cherished and will ever cherish the desire that  all men may attain His gardens of Paradise with utmost love, that no one  should sadden another, not even for a moment, and that all should dwell  within His cradle of protection and security until the Day of Resurrection  which marketh the dayspring of the Revelation of Him Whom God will make  manifest.

Trichinopoli must have fallen at once; and we,  without a hundred soldiers here, should have had nothing to do but  pack up and go. As it was, Gingen's beaten men were allowed to retreat  quietly towards Trichinopoli.    \"The next day D'Auteuil was better, and followed in pursuit, and  Gingen had the greatest difficulty in reaching Trichinopoli. There, at  the present moment, we lie shut up, a portion of our force only  remaining outside the walls.    \"The place itself is strong. The town lies round a lofty rock, on  which stands the fortress, which commands the country for some  distance round. Still, there is no question that the French could take  it, if they attacked it. Our men are utterly dispirited with defeat.  Cope and Gingen have neither enterprise nor talent.    \"At present the enemy, who are now under the command of Colonel Law,  who has succeeded D'Auteuil, are contenting themselves with  beleaguering the place. But as we have no troops whatever to send to  its rescue, and Muhammud Ali has no friends elsewhere to whom to look  for aid, it is a matter of absolute certainty that the place must  fall, and then Dupleix will only have to request us to leave, and we  shall have nothing else to do but to go at once. So I should advise  you not to trouble yourself to unpack your luggage, for in all  probability another fortnight will see us on board ship.    \"There, that's a tremendous long yarn I've been telling you, and not a  pleasant one. It's a history of defeat, loss of prestige and position.  We have been out fought and out diplomatized, and have made a mess of  everything we put our hand to. I should think you must be tired of it.  I am. I haven't done so much talking, for years.\"    Charlie and Peters thanked their new acquaintance, warmly, for the  pains he had taken in explaining the various circumstances and events  which had led to the present unfortunate position; and Charlie asked,  as they stood up to say goodnight to Mr. Johnson, \"What has become of  Clive, all this time?\"    \"After the conquest of Devikota,\" Mr. Johnson said, \"the civilians in  the service were called back to their posts; but to show that they  recognized his services, the authorities allowed Clive to attain the  rank of captain, which would have been bestowed upon him had he  remained in the military service, and they appointed him commissary to  the army, a post which would take him away from the office work he  hated. Almost directly afterwards, he got a bad attack of fever, and  was forced to take a cruise in the Bay of Bengal. He came back in time  to go with Gingen's force; but after the defeat of Valkonda he  resigned his office, I suppose in disgust, and returned to Fort Saint  David. In July, some of the Company's ships came in with some  reinforcements. There were no military officers left at Fort Saint  David, so Mr. Pigot, a member of the council, started with a large  convoy of stores, escorted by eighty English and three hundred Sepoys.  Clive volunteered to accompany them. They had to march thirty or forty  miles to Verdachelam, a town close to the frontier of Tanjore, through  which the convoy to Trichinopoli would be able to pass unopposed, but  the intervening country was hostile to the English.    \"However, the convoy passed unmolested, and after seeing it safely to  that point, Pigot and Clive set out to return, with an escort of  twelve Sepoys. They were at once attacked, and for miles a heavy fire  was kept up on them. Seven of the escort were killed, the rest reached  Fort Saint David in safety. Pigot's report of Clive's conduct,  strengthened by that previously made by Major Lawrence, induced the  authorities to transfer him permanently to the army. He received a  commission as captain and was sent off, with a small detachment  remaining at Saint David's, to Devikota.    \"There he placed himself under Captain Clarke, who commanded; and the  whole body, numbering altogether a hundred English, fifty Sepoys, with  a small field piece, marched up to Trichinopoli, and I hear managed to  make its way in safety. He got in about a month ago.\"    \"And what force have we altogether, here and at Saint David's, in case  Trichinopoli falls?\"    \"What with the detachment that came with you, and two others which  arrived about ten days back, we have altogether about three hundred  and fifty men. What on earth could these do against all the force of  the nawab, the subadar, and three or four thousand French troops?\"    The prospect certainly seemed gloomy in the extreme, and the young  writers retired to their beds, on this, the first night of their  arrival in India, with the conviction that circumstances were in a  desperate position.    The next day they set to work, and at its end agreed that they should  bear the loss of their situations, and their expulsion from the  country, with more than resignation. It was now August, the heat was  terrible, and as they sat in their shirtsleeves at their desks, bathed  in perspiration, at their work of copying invoices, they felt that any  possible change of circumstances would be for the better.    The next day, and the next, still further confirmed these ideas. The  nights were nearly as hot as the days. Tormented by mosquitoes, they  tossed restlessly in their beds for hours, dozing off towards morning  and awaking unrefreshed and worn out. When released from work at the  end of the third day, Charlie and Peters strolled down together to the  beach, and bewailed their hard fate.    \"There are two ships coming from the south,\" Charlie said presently.  \"I wonder whether they're from England, or Fort Saint David?\"    \"Which do you hope they will be?\" Peters said.    \"I hope they're from Saint David's,\" Charlie answered. \"Even if they  made a quick voyage, they couldn't have left England many weeks after  us; and although I should be glad to get news from home, I am still  more anxious, just at present, for news from Saint David's. Between  ourselves, I long to hear of the fall of Trichinopoli. Everyone says  it is certain to take place before long, and the sooner it does, the  sooner we shall be out of this frightful place.\"    After dinner they again went down to the beach, and were joined by  Doctor Rae, who chatted with them as to the ships, which were now just  anchoring. These had already signalled that they were from Saint  David's, and that they had on board Mr. Saunders, the governor, and a  detachment of troops. Already the soldiers from the Lizzie Anderson,  aided by a number of natives, were at work pitching tents in the fort  for the reception of the newcomers, and conjecture was busy on shore,  among the civilians, as to the object of bringing troops from Saint  David's to Madras, that is, directly away from the scene of action.    \"It is one of two things,\" Doctor Rae said: \"Either Trichinopoli has  surrendered and they are evacuating Fort Saint David, or they have  news that the nawab is marching to attack us here. I should think it  to be the latter, for Fort Saint David is a great deal stronger than  this place, though the French did strengthen it during their stay  here. If, then, the authorities have determined to abandon one of the  two towns, and to concentrate all their force for the defence of the  other, I should have thought they would have held on to Saint David's.    \"There is a boat being lowered from one of the ships, so we shall soon  have news.\"    A signal from the ship announced that the governor was about to land,  and the principal persons at the factory assembled on the beach to  receive him. Doctor Rae and the two young writers stood, a short  distance from the party. As the boat was beached, Mr. Saunders sprang  out and, surrounded by those assembled to meet him, walked at once  towards the factory. An officer got out from the boat and  superintended the debarkation of the baggage, which a number of  coolies at once placed on their heads and carried away.    The officer was following them, when his eye fell upon Doctor Rae.    \"Ah! Doctor,\" he said, \"how are you? When did you get out again from  England?\"    \"Only three or four days since, Captain Clive. I did not recognize  you, at first. I am glad to see you again.\"    \"Yes, I have cast my slough,\" Captain Clive said, laughing, \"and have,  thank God, exchanged my pen for a sword, for good.\"    \"You were able to fight, though, as a civilian,\" Doctor Rae said,  laughing.    \"Yes, we had some tough fighting behind the ramparts of Saint David's,  and in the trenches before Pondicherry; but we shall have sharper  work, still before us, or I am mistaken.\"    \"What! Are they going to attack us here?\" Doctor Rae exclaimed.    \"Oh no, just the other way,\" Captain Clive said. \"We are going to  carry the war into their quarters. It is a secret yet, and must not go  farther.\"    And he included the two writers in his look.    \"These are two fresh comers, Captain Clive. They came out in the same  ship with me. This is Mr. Marryat, this Mr. Peters. They are both  brave young gentlemen, and had an opportunity of proving it on the way  out, for we were twice engaged; the first time with privateers; the  second, a very sharp affair, with pirates. That ship lying off there  is a pirate we captured.\"    \"Aha!\" Captain Clive said, looking keenly at the lads. \"Well, young  gentlemen, and how do you like what you have seen of your life here?\"    \"We hate it, sir,\" Charlie said. \"We would, both of us, a thousand  times rather enlist under you as private soldiers. Oh, sir, if there  is any expedition going to take place, do you think there is a chance  of our being allowed to go as volunteers?\"    \"I will see about it,\" Captain Clive said, smiling. \"Trade must be  dull enough here, at present, and we want every hand that can hold a  sword or a musket in the field.    \"You are sure you can recommend them?\" he said, turning to Doctor Rae  with a smile.    \"Most"]]]
