Yet man  must work the earth to earn his food.[38]    The Divine resolution to bestow a companion on Adam met the  wishes of man, who had been overcome by a feeling of isolation  when the animals came to him in pairs to be named.[39] To banish  his loneliness, Lilith was first given to Adam as wife. Like him  she had been created out of the dust of the ground. But she  remained with him only a short time, because she insisted upon  enjoying full equality with her husband. She derived her rights  from their identical origin. With the help of the Ineffable Name,  which she pronounced, Lilith flew away from Adam, and vanished in  the air. Adam complained before God that the wife He had given  him had deserted him, and God sent forth three angels to capture  her. They found her in the Red Sea, and they sought to make her  go back with the threat that, unless she went, she would lose a  hundred of her demon children daily by death. But Lilith  preferred this punishment to living with Adam. She takes her  revenge by injuring babes--baby boys during the first night of  their life, while baby girls are exposed to her wicked designs  until they are twenty days old. The only way to ward off the evil  is to attach an amulet bearing the names of her three angel  captors to the children, for such had been the agreement between  them.[40]    The woman destined to become the true companion of man was taken  from Adam's body, for \"only when like is joined unto like the  union is indissoluble.\"[41] The creation of woman from man was  possible because Adam originally had two faces, which were  separated at the birth of Eve.[42]    When God was on the point of making Eve, He said: \"I will not  make her from the head of man, lest she carry her head high in  arrogant pride; not from the eye, lest she be wanton-eyed; not  from the ear, lest she be an eavesdropper; not from the neck,  lest she be insolent; not from the mouth, lest she be a tattler;  not from the heart, lest she be inclined to envy; not from the  hand, lest she be a meddler; not from the foot, lest she be a  gadabout. I will form her from a chaste portion of the body,\" and  to every limb and organ as He formed it, God said, \"Be chaste! Be  chaste!\" Nevertheless, in spite of the great caution used, woman  has all the faults God tried to obviate. The daughters of Zion  were haughty and walked with stretched forth necks and wanton  eyes; Sarah was an eavesdropper in her own tent, when the angel  spoke with Abraham; Miriam was a talebearer, accusing Moses;  Rachel was envious of her sister Leah; Eve put out her hand to  take the forbidden fruit, and Dinah was a gadabout.[43]    The physical formation of woman is far more complicated than that  of man, as it must be for the function of child-bearing, and  likewise the intelligence of woman matures more quickly than the  intelligence of man.[44] Many of the physical and psychical  differences between the two sexes must be attributed to the fact  that man was formed from the ground and woman from bone. Women  need perfumes, while men do not; dust of the ground remains the  same no matter how long it is kept; flesh, however, requires salt  to keep it in good condition. The voice of women is shrill, not  so the voice of men; when soft viands are cooked, no sound is  heard, but let a bone be put in a pot, and at once it crackles. A  man is easily placated, not so a woman; a few drops of water  suffice to soften a clod of earth; a bone stays hard, and if it  were to soak in water for days. The man must ask the woman to be  his wife, and not the woman the man to be her husband, because it  is man who has sustained the loss of his rib, and he sallies  forth to make good his loss again. The very differences between  the sexes in garb and social forms go back to the origin of man  and woman for their reasons. Woman covers her hair in token of  Eve's having brought sin into the world; she tries to hide her  shame; and women precede men in a funeral cortege, because it was  woman who brought death into the world. And the religious  commands addressed to women alone are connected with the history  of Eve. Adam was the heave offering of the world, and Eve defiled  it. As expiation, all women are commanded to separate a heave  offering from the dough. And because woman extinguished the light  of man's soul, she is bidden to kindle the Sabbath light.[45]    Adam was first made to fall into a deep sleep before the rib for  Eve was taken from his side. For, had he watched her creation,  she would not have awakened love in him. To this day it is true  that men do not appreciate the charms of women whom they have  known and observed from childhood up. Indeed, God had created a  wife for Adam before Eve, but he would not have her, because she  had been made in his presence. Knowing well all the details of  her formation, he was repelled by her.[46] But when he roused  himself from his profound sleep, and saw Eve before him in all  her surprising beauty and grace, he exclaimed, \"This is she who  caused my heart to throb many a night!\" Yet he discerned at once  what the nature of woman was. She would, he knew, seek to carry  her point with man either by entreaties and tears, or flattery  and caresses. He said, therefore, \"This is my never-silent  bell!\"[47]    The wedding of the first couple was celebrated with pomp never  repeated in the whole course of history since. God Himself,  before presenting her to Adam, attired and adorned Eve as a  bride. Yea, He appealed to the angels, saying: \"Come, let us  perform services of friendship for Adam and his helpmate, for the  world rests upon friendly services, and they are more pleasing in  My sight than the sacrifices Israel will offer upon the altar.\"  The angels accordingly surrounded the marriage canopy, and God  pronounced the blessings upon the bridal couple, as the Hazan  does under the Huppah. The angels then danced and played upon  musical instruments before Adam and Eve in their ten bridal  chambers of gold, pearls, and precious stones, which God had  prepared for them.    Adam called his wife Ishah, and himself he called Ish, abandoning  the name Adam, which he had borne before the creation of Eve, for  the reason that God added His own name Yah to the names of the  man and the woman--Yod to Ish and He to Ishah--to indicate that  as long as they walked in the ways of God and observed His  commandments, His name would shield them against all harm. But if  they went astray, His name would be withdrawn, and instead of Ish  there would remain Esh, fire, a fire issuing from each and  consuming the other.[48]      ADAM AND EVE IN PARADISE    The Garden of Eden was the abode of the first man and woman, and  the souls of all men must pass through it after death, before  they reach their final destination. For the souls of the departed  must go through seven portals before they arrive in the heaven  'Arabot. There the souls of the pious are transformed into  angels, and there they remain forever, praising God and feasting  their sight upon the glory of the Shekinah. The first portal is  the Cave of Machpelah, in the vicinity of Paradise, which is  under the care and supervision of Adam. If the soul that presents  herself at the portal is worthy, he calls out, \"Make room! Thou  art welcome!\" The soul then proceeds until she arrives at the  gate of Paradise guarded by the cherubim and the flaming sword.  If she is not found worthy, she is consumed by the sword;  otherwise she receives a pass-bill, which admits her to the  terrestrial Paradise. Therein is a pillar of smoke and light  extending from Paradise to the gate of heaven, and it depends  upon the character of the soul whether she can climb upward on it  and reach heaven. The third portal, Zebul, is at the entrance of  heaven. If the soul is worthy, the guard opens the portal and  admits her 'to the heavenly Temple. Michael presents her to God,  and conducts her to the seventh portal, 'Arabot, within which the  souls of the pious, changed to angels, praise the Lord, and feed  on the glory of the Shekinah.[49]    In Paradise stand the tree of life and the tree of knowledge, the  latter forming a hedge about the former. Only he who has cleared  a path for himself through the tree of knowledge can come close  to the tree of life, which is so huge that it would take a man  five hundred years to traverse a distance equal to the diameter  of the trunk, and no less vast is the space shaded by its crown  of branches. From beneath it flows forth the water that irrigates  the whole earth,[50] parting thence into four streams, the  Ganges, the Nile, the Tigris, and the Euphrates.[51] But it was  only during the days of creation that the realm of plants looked  to the waters of the earth for nourishment. Later on God made the  plants dependent upon the rain, the upper waters. The clouds rise  from earth to heaven, where water is poured into them as from a  conduit.[52] The plants began to feel the effect of the water  only after Adam was created. Although they had been brought forth  on the third day, God did not permit them to sprout and appear  above the surface of the earth, until Adam prayed to Him to give  food unto them, for God longs for the prayers of the pious.[53]    Paradise being such as it was, it was, naturally, not necessary  for Adam to work the land. True, the Lord God put the man into  the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it, but that only  means he is to study the Torah there and fulfil the commandments  of God.[54] There were especially six commandments which every  human being is expected to heed: man should not worship idols;  nor blaspheme God; nor commit murder, nor incest, nor theft and  robbery; and all generations have the duty of instituting  measures of law and order.[55] One more such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1494"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews â€” Volume 2 (#13)"],[1,"time of the prophet Ezekiel.[177]    Joseph did more than merely interpret the dreams. When  the king gave voice to doubts concerning the interpretation,  he told him signs and tokens. He said: \"Let this be a sign  to thee that my words are true, and my advice is excellent:  Thy wife, who is sitting upon the birthstool at this moment,  will bring forth a son, and thou wilt rejoice over him, but  in the midst of thy joy the sad tidings will be told thee of  the death of thine older son, who was born unto thee but two  years ago, and thou must needs find consolation for the loss  of the one in the birth of the other.\"    Scarcely had Joseph withdrawn from the presence of the  king, when the report of the birth of a son was brought to  Pharaoh, and soon after also the report of the death of his  first-born, who had suddenly dropped to the floor and passed  away. Thereupon he sent for all the grandees of his realm,  and all his servants, and he spake to them, saying: \"Ye  have heard the words of the Hebrew, and ye have seen that  the signs which he foretold were accomplished, and I also  know that he hath interpreted the dream truly. Advise me  now how the land may be saved from the ravages of the  famine. Look hither and thither whether you can find a  man of wisdom and understanding, whom I may set over  the land, for I am convinced that the land can be saved only  if we heed the counsel of the Hebrew.\" The grandees and  the princes admitted that safety could be secured only by  adhering to the advice given by Joseph, and they proposed  that the king, in his sagacity, choose a man whom he considered  equal to the great task.[178] Thereupon Pharaoh said:  \"If we traversed and searched the earth from end to end,  we could find none such as Joseph, a man in whom is the  spirit of God.[179] If ye think well thereof, I will set him over  the land which he hath saved by his wisdom.\"[180]    The astrologers, who were his counsellors, demurred, saying,  \"A slave, one whom his present owner hath acquired  for twenty pieces of silver, thou proposest to set over us as  master?\" But Pharaoh maintained that Joseph was not  only a free-born man beyond the peradventure of a doubt,  but also the scion of a noble family.[181] However, the princes  of Pharaoh were not silenced, they continued to give utterance  to their opposition to Joseph, saying: \"Dost thou not  remember the immutable law of the Egyptians, that none  may serve as king or as viceroy unless he speaks all the  languages of men? And this Hebrew knows none but his  own tongue, and how were it possible that a man should rule  over us who cannot even speak the language of our land?  Send and have him fetched hither, and examine him in  respect to all the things a ruler should know and have, and  then decide as seemeth wise in thy sight.\"    Pharaoh yielded, he promised to do as they wished, and  he appointed the following day as the time for examining  Joseph, who had returned to his prison in the meantime,  for, on account of his wife, his master feared to have him  stay in his house. During the night Gabriel appeared unto  Joseph, and taught him all the seventy languages, and he  acquired them quickly after the angel had changed his name  from Joseph to Jehoseph. The next morning, when he came  into the presence of Pharaoh and the nobles of the kingdom,  inasmuch as he knew every one of the seventy languages,  he mounted all the steps of the royal throne, until he reached  the seventieth, the highest, upon which sat the king, and  Pharaoh and his princes rejoiced that Joseph fulfilled all the  requirements needed by one that was to rule over Egypt.    The king said to Joseph: \"Thou didst give me the  counsel to look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over  the land of Egypt, that he may in his wisdom save the land  from the famine. As God hath showed thee all this, and as  thou art master of all the languages of the world, there is  none so discreet and wise as thou. Thou shalt therefore be  the second in the land after Pharaoh, and according unto thy  word shall all my people go in and go out; my princes and  my servants shall receive their monthly appanage from thee;  before thee the people shall prostrate themselves, only in the  throne will I be greater than thou.\"[182]      THE RULER OF EGYPT    Now Joseph reaped the harvest of his virtues, and according  to the measure of his merits God granted him reward.  The mouth that refused the kiss of unlawful passion and  sin received the kiss of homage from the people; the neck  that did not bow itself unto sin was adorned with the gold  chain that Pharaoh put upon it; the hands that did not  touch sin wore the signet ring that Pharaoh took from his  own hand and put upon Joseph's; the body that did not come  in contact with sin was arrayed in vestures of byssus; the  feet that made no steps in the direction of sin reposed in the  royal chariot, and the thoughts that kept themselves undefiled  by sin were proclaimed as wisdom.[183]    Joseph was installed in his high position, and invested  with the insignia of his office, with solemn ceremony. The  king took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon  Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in princely apparel, and set  a gold crown upon his head, and laid a gold chain about his  neck. Then he commanded his servants to make Joseph to  ride in his second chariot, which went by the side of the  chariot wherein sat the king, and he also made him to ride  upon a great and strong horse of the king's horses, and his  servants conducted him through the streets of the city  of Egypt. Musicians, no less than a thousand striking  cymbals and a thousand blowing flutes, and five thousand  men with drawn swords gleaming in the air formed the vanguard.  Twenty thousand of the king's grandees girt with  gold-embroidered leather belts marched at the right of  Joseph, and as many at the left of him.[184] The women and  the maidens of the nobility looked out of the windows to  gaze upon Joseph's beauty, and they poured down chains  upon him, and rings and jewels, that he might but direct  his eyes toward them. Yet he did not look up, and as a reward  God made him proof against the evil eye, nor has it  ever had the power of inflicting harm upon any of his  descendants.[185] Servants of the king, preceding him and  following him, burnt incense upon his path, and cassia, and all  manner of sweet spices, and strewed myrrh and aloes wherever  he went. Twenty heralds walked before him, and they  proclaimed: \"This is the man whom the king bath chosen  to be the second after him. All the affairs of state will be  administered by him, and whoever resisteth his commands,  or refuseth to bow down to the ground before him, he will  die the death of the rebel against the king and the king's  deputy.\"    Without delay the people prostrated themselves, and they  cried, \"Long live the king, and long live the deputy of the  king!\" And Joseph, looking down from his horse upon  the people and their exultation, exclaimed, his eyes directed  heavenward: \"The Lord raiseth up the poor out of the  dust, and lifteth up the needy from the dunghill. O Lord  of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in Thee.\"    After Joseph, accompanied by Pharaoh's officers and  princes, had journeyed through the whole city of Egypt,  and viewed all there was therein, he returned to the king on  the selfsame day, and the king gave him fields and vineyards  as a present, and also three thousand talents of silver, and  a thousand talents of gold, and onyx stones and bdellium,  and many other costly things. The king commanded, moreover,  that every Egyptian give Joseph a gift, else he would  be put to death. A platform was erected in the open street,  and there all deposited their presents, and among the things  were many of gold and silver, as well as precious stones,  carried thither by the people and also the grandees, for they  saw that Joseph enjoyed the favor of the king. Furthermore,  Joseph received one hundred slaves from Pharaoh,  and they were to do all his bidding, and he himself acquired  many more, for he resided in a spacious palace. Three years  it took to build it. Special magnificence was lavished upon  the hall of state, which was his audience chamber, and upon  the throne fashioned of gold and silver and inlaid with  precious stones, whereon there was a representation of the  whole land of Egypt and of the river Nile. And as Joseph  multiplied in riches, so he increased also in wisdom, for God  added to his wisdom that all might love and honor him.[186]  Pharaoh called him Zaphenath-paneah, he who can reveal  secret things with ease, and rejoiceth the heart of man  therewith. Each letter of the name Zaphenath-paneah has a  meaning, too. The first, Zadde, stands for Zofeh, seer; Pe  for Podeh, redeemer; Nun for Nabi, prophet; Taw for  Tomek, supporter; Pe for Poter, interpreter of dreams; Ain  for Arum, clever; Nun for Nabon, discreet; and Het for  Hakam, wise.[187]    The name of Joseph's wife pointed to her history in the  same way. Asenath was the daughter of Dinah and Hamor,  but she was abandoned at the borders of Egypt, only, that  people might know who she was, Jacob engraved the story  of her parentage and her birth upon a gold plate fastened  around her neck. The day on which Asenath was exposed,  Potiphar went walking with his servants near the city  wall, and they heard the voice of a child. At the captain's  bidding they brought the baby to him, and when he read  her history from the gold plate, he determined to adopt her.  He took her home with him, and raised her as his daughter.  The Alef in Asenath stands for On, where Potiphar was  priest; the Samek for Setirah, Hidden, for she was kept concealed  on account of her extraordinary beauty; the Nun for  Nohemet, for she wept and entreated that she might be delivered  from the house of the heathen Potiphar; and the Taw  for Tammah, the"]]]
