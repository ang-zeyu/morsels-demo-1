But he's always here before it's completely  dark.\"    The glance of Buck Daniels kicked over to Lee Haines, exchanged meanings  with him, and came back to Kate.    \"Terrible sorry,\" he said, \"but I s'pose we'll have to be on our way  before it's plumb dark.\"    \"Go so soon as that? Why, I won't let you.\"    \"I--\" began Haines, fumbling for words.    \"We got to get down in the valley before it's dark,\" filled in Buck.    Suddenly she laughed, frankly, happily.    \"I know what you mean, but Dan is changed; he isn't the same man he used  to be.\"    \"Yes?\" queried Buck, without conviction.    \"You'll have to see him to believe; Buck, he doesn't even whistle any  more.\"    \"What?\"    \"Only goes about singing, now.\"    The two men exchanged glances of such astonishment that Kate could not  help but notice and flush a little.    \"Well,\" murmured Buck, \"Bart doesn't seem to have changed much from the  old days.\"    She laughed slowly, letting her mind run back through such happiness as  they could not understand and when she looked up she seemed to debate  whether or not it would be worth while to let them in on the delightful  secret. The moment she dwelt on the burning logs they gazed at her and  then to each other with utter amazement as if they sat in the same room  with the dead come to life. No care of motherhood had marked her face,  but on the white, even forehead was a sign of peace; and drifting over  her hands and on the white apron across her lap the firelight pooled dim  gold, the wealth of contentment.    \"If you'd been here today you would have seen how changed he is. We  had a man with us whom Dan had taken while he was running from a posse,  wounded, and kept him here until he was well, and--\"    \"That's Dan,\" murmured Lee Haines. \"He's gold all through when a man's  in trouble.\"    \"Shut up, Lee,\" cut in Buck. He sat forward in his chair, drinking up  her story.    \"Go on.\"    \"This morning we saw the same posse skirting through the valley and knew  that they were on the old trail. Dan sent Gregg over the hills and rode  Vic's horse down so that the posse would mistake him, and he could lead  them out of the way. I was afraid, terribly, I was afraid that if the  posse got close and began shooting Dan would--\"    She stopped; her eyes begged them to understand.    \"Go on,\" said Lee Haines, shuddering slightly. \"I know what you mean.\"    \"But I watched him ride down the slope,\" she cried joyously, \"and I saw  the posse close on him--almost on top of him when he reached the valley.  I saw the flash of their guns. I saw them shoot. I wasn't afraid that  Dan would be hurt, for he seems to wear a charm against bullets--I  wasn't much afraid of that, but I dreaded to see him turn and go back  through that posse like a storm. But--\" she caught both hands to her  breast and her bright face tilted up--\"even when the bullets must have  been whistling around him he didn't look back. He rode straight on and  on, out of view, and I knew\"--her voice broke with emotion--\"oh, Buck,  I knew that he had won, and I had won; that he was safe forever; that  there was no danger of him ever slipping back into that terrible other  self; I knew that I'd never again have to dream of that whistling in the  wind; I knew that he was ours--Joan's and mine.\"    \"By God,\" broke out Buck, \"I'm happier than if you'd found a gold mine,  Kate. It don't seem no ways--but if you seen that with your own eyes,  it's possible true. He's changed.\"    \"I've been almost afraid to be happy all these years,\" she said, \"but  now I want to sing and cry at the same time. My heart is so full that  it's overflowing, Buck.\"    She brushed the tears away and smiled at them.    \"Tell me all about yourselves. Everything. You first, Lee. You've been  longer away.\"    He did not answer for a moment, but sat with his head fallen, watching  her thoughtfully. Women had been the special curse in Lee Haines' life;  they had driven him to the crime that sent him West into outlawry long  years before; through women, as he himself foreboded, he would come at  last to some sordid, petty end; but here sat the only one he had loved  without question, without regret, purely and deeply, and as he watched  her, more beautiful than she had been in her girlhood, it seemed, as he  heard the fitful laughter of Joan outside, the old sorrow came storming  up in him, and the sense of loss.    \"What have I been doing?\" he murmured at length. He shrugged away his  last thoughts. \"I drifted about for a while after the pardon came down  from the governor. People knew me, you see, and what they knew about me  didn't please them. Even today Jim Silent and Jim Silent's crew isn't  forgotten. Then don't look at me like that, Kate; no, I played straight  all the time---then I ran into Buck and he and I had tried each other  out, we had at least one thing in common\"--here he looked at Buck and  they both flushed--\"and we made a partnership of it. We've been together  five years now.\"    \"I knew you could break away, Lee. I used to tell you that.\"    \"You helped me more than you knew,\" he said quietly.    She smiled and then turned to escape him. \"And now you, Buck?\"    \"Since then we've made a bit of coin punching cows and we've blown it in  again prospecting. Blown it in? Kate, we've shot enough powder to lift  that mountain yonder but all we've got is color. You could gild the sky  with what we've seen but we haven't washed enough dust to wear a hole in  a tissue-paper pocket. I'll tell you the whole story. Lee packs a jinx  with him. But--Haines, did you ever see a lion as big as that?\"    The dimness of evening had grown rapidly through the room while they  talked and now the light from the door was far less than the glow of the  fire. The yellow flicker picked out a dozen pelts stretching as rugs on  the floor or hanging along the wall; that to which Buck pointed was an  enormous skin of a mountain lion stretched sidewise, for if it had been  hung straight up a considerable portion of the tail must have dragged on  the floor. Buck went to examine it. Presently he exclaimed in surprise  and he passed his fingers over it as though searching for something.    \"Where was it shot, Kate? I don't find nothin' but this cut that looks  like his knife slipped when he was skinnin'.\"    \"It was a knife that killed it.\"    \"What!\"    \"Don't ask me about it; I see the picture of it in my dreams still. The  lion had dragged the trap into a cave and Bart followed it. Dan went in  pushing his rifle before him, but--when he tried to fire it jammed.\"    \"Yes?\" they cried together.    \"Don't ask me the rest!\"    They would hardly have let her off so easily if it had not been for the  entrance of Joan who had come back on account of the darkness. Black  Bart went promptly to a corner of the hearth and lay down with his head  on his paws and the little girl sat beside him watching the fire, her  head leaning wearily on his shoulder. Kate went to the door.    \"It's almost night,\" she said. \"Why isn't he here?\"    \"Buck, they couldn't have overtaken--\"    She started. \"Dan?\"    Buck Daniels grinned reassuringly.    \"Not unless his hoss is a pile of bones; if it has any heart in it,  Dan'll run away from anything on four legs. No call for worryin', Kate.  He's simply led 'em a long ways off and waited for evenin' before he  doubled back. He'll come back right enough. If they didn't catch him  that first run they'll never get the wind of him.\"    It quieted her for a time, but as the minutes slipped away, as the  darkness grew more and more heavy until a curtain of black fell across  the open door, they could see that she was struggling to control her  trouble, they could see her straining to catch some distant sound. Lee  Haines began to talk valiantly, to beguile the waiting time, and Buck  Daniels did his share with stories of their prospecting, but eventually  more and more often silences came on the group. They began to watch the  fire and they winced when a log crackled, or when the sap in a green  place hissed. By degrees they pushed farther and farther back so that  the light would not strike so fully upon them, for in some way it became  difficult to meet each other's eyes.    Only Joan was perfectly at ease. She played for a time with the ears of  Black Bart, or pried open his mouth and made him show the great white  fangs, or scratched odd designs on the hearth with pieces of charcoal;  but finally she lost interest in all these things and let her head lie  on the rough pelt of the wolf-dog, sound asleep. The firelight made her  hair a patch of gold.    Black Bart slept soundly, too, that is, as soundly as one of his nature  could sleep, for every now and then one of his ears twitched, or he  stirred a paw, or an eyelid quivered up. Yet they all started when he  jumped from his sleep into full wakefulness; the motion made Joan sit  up, rubbing her eyes, and Black Bart reached the center of the room  noiselessly. He stood facing the door, motionless.    \"It's Dan,\" cried Kate. \"Bart hears him! Good old Bart!\"    The dog pointed up his nose, the hair about his neck bristled into a  ruff, and out of his quaking body came a sound that seemed to moan and  whimper from the distance at first, but drew nearer, louder, packed the  room with terror, the long drawn howl of a wolf.        Chapter XIII. Equal Payment    They knew what it meant; even Joan had heard the cry of the lone wolf  hunting in the lean time of winter, and of all things sad, all things  lonely, all things demoniacal, the howl of a wolf stands alone. Lee  Haines reached for his gun, little Joan stood up silent on the hearth,  but Kate and Buck Daniels sat listening with a sort of hungry terror,  as the cry sobbed away to quiet. Then out of the mountains and the night  came an answer so thin, so eerie, one might have said it was the voice  of the mountains and white stars"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18993"],[0,"History  of the World War: An Authentic Narrative of the World's Greatest War (#13)"],[1,"against Germany and Austria-Hungary, April 22, 1918.

CHAPTER V    THE GREAT WAR BEGINS    Years before 1914, when Germany declared war against civilization, it  was decided by the German General Staff to strike at France through  Belgium. The records of the German Foreign Office prove that fact. The  reason for this lay in the long line of powerful fortresses along the  line that divides France from Germany and the sparsely spaced and  comparatively out-of-date forts on the border between Germany and  Belgium. True, there was a treaty guaranteeing the inviolability of  Belgian territory to which Germany was a signatory party. Some of the  clauses of that treaty were:      Article 9. Belgium, within the limits traced in conformity with the  principles laid down in the present preliminaries, shall form a  perpetually neutral state. The five powers (England, France, Austria,  Prussia and Russia), without wishing to intervene in the internal  affairs of Belgium, guarantee her that perpetual neutrality as well as  the integrity and inviolability of her territory in the limits mentioned  in the present article.    Article 10. By just reciprocity Belgium shall be held to observe this  same neutrality toward all the other states and to make no attack on  their internal or external tranquillity while always preserving the  right to defend herself against any foreign aggression.      This agreement was followed on January 23, 1839, by a definitive treaty,  accepted by Belgium and by the Netherlands, which treaty regulates  Belgium's neutrality as follows:      Article 7. Belgium, within the limits defined in Articles 1, 2 and 4  shall form an independent and perpetually neutral state. She is  obligated to preserve this neutrality against all the other states.      To convert this solemn covenant into a \"scrap of paper\" it was necessary  that Germany should find an excuse for tearing it to pieces. There was  absolutely no provocation in sight, but that did not deter the German  High Command. That august body with no information whatever to afford an  excuse, alleged in a formal note to the Belgian Government that the  French army intended to invade Germany through Belgian territory. This  hypocritical and mendacious note and Belgium's vigorous reply follow:      Note handed in on August 2, 1914, at 7 o'clock P. M., by Herr von  Below-Saleske, German Minister, to M. Davignon, Belgian Minister for  Foreign Affairs.      BRUSSELS, 2d August, 1914.  IMPERIAL GERMAN LEGATION IN BELGIUM  (Highly confidential)    The German Government has received reliable information according to  which the French forces intend to march on the Meuse, by way of Givet  and Namur. This information leaves no doubt as to the intention of  France of marching on Germany through Belgian territory. The Imperial  Government cannot avoid the fear that Belgium, in spite of its best  will, will be in no position to repulse such a largely developed French  march without aid. In this fact there is sufficient certainty of a  threat directed against Germany.    It is an imperative duty for the preservation of Germany to forestall  this attack of the enemy.    The German Government would feel keen regret if Belgium should regard as  an act of hostility against herself the fact that the measures of the  enemies of Germany oblige her on her part to violate Belgian territory.  In order to dissipate any misunderstanding the German Government  declares as follows:    1. Germany does not contemplate any act of hostility against Belgium. If  Belgium consents in the war about to commence to take up an attitude of  friendly neutrality toward Germany, the German Government on its part  undertakes, on the declaration of peace, to guarantee the kingdom and  its possessions in their whole extent.    2. Germany undertakes under the conditions laid down to evacuate Belgian  territory as soon as peace is concluded.    3. If Belgium preserves a friendly attitude, Germany is prepared, in  agreement with the authorities of the Belgian Government, to buy against  cash all that is required by her troops, and to give indemnity for the  damages caused in Belgium.    4. If Belgium behaves in a hostile manner toward the German troops, and  in particular raises difficulties against their advance by the  opposition of the fortifications of the Meuse, or by destroying roads,  railways, tunnels, or other engineering works, Germany will be compelled  to consider Belgium as an enemy.      In this case Germany will take no engagements toward Belgium, but she  will leave the later settlement of relations of the two states toward  one another to the decision of arms. The German Government has a  justified hope that this contingency will not arise and that the Belgian  Government will know how to take suitable measures to hinder its taking  place. In this case the friendly relations which unite the two  neighboring states will become closer and more lasting.      THE REPLY BY BELGIUM  Note handed in by M. Davignon, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to Herr von  Below-Saleske, German Minister.      BRUSSELS, 3d August, 1914.  (7 o'clock in the morning.)    By the note of the 2d August, 1914, the German Government has made known  that according to certain intelligence the French forces intend to march  on the Meuse via Givet and Namur and that Belgium, in spite of her  good-will, would not be able without help to beat off an advance of the  French troops.    The German Government felt it to be its duty to forestall this attack  and to violate Belgian territory. Under these conditions Germany  proposes to the King's Government to take up a friendly attitude, and  undertakes at the moment of peace to guarantee the integrity of the  kingdom and of her possessions in their whole extent. The note adds that  if Belgium raises difficulties to the forward march of the German troops  Germany will be compelled to consider her as an enemy and to leave the  later settlement of the two states toward one another to the decision of  arms.    This note caused profound and painful surprise to the King's Government.    The intentions which it attributed to France are in contradiction with  the express declarations which were made to us on the 1st of August, in  the name of the government of the republic.    Moreover, if, contrary to our expectation, a violation of Belgian  neutrality were to be committed by France, Belgium would fulfil all her  international duties and her army would offer the most vigorous  opposition to the invader.    The treaties of 1839, confirmed by the treaties of 1870, establish the  independence and the neutrality of Belgium under the guarantee of the  powers, and particularly of the Government of his Majesty the King of  Prussia.    Belgium has always been faithful to her international obligations; she  has fulfilled her duties in a spirit of loyal impartiality; she has  neglected no effort to maintain her neutrality or to make it respected.    The attempt against her independence with which the German Government  threatens her would constitute a flagrant violation of international  law. No strategic interest justifies the violation of that law.    The Belgian Government would, by accepting the propositions which are  notified to her, sacrifice the honor of the nation while at the same  time betraying her duties toward Europe.
