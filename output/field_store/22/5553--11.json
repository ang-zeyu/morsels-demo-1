Whatever the cause, it is quite certain that the Crown Prince and some  of the Danish statesmen treated him with studied cordiality. Sir Hyde  Parker was a drag, and indeed, an intolerable nuisance to him. When  the armistice was sealed and settled for fourteen weeks, he wished to  get of to Reval and hammer the Russian squadron there, but the  commander-in-chief shirked all responsibility, and his victim was made  to say in a letter to Lord St. Vincent \"that he would have been in  Reval fourteen days before, and that no one could tell what he had  suffered,\" and asks my dear Lord \"if he has deserved well, to let him  retire, and if ill, for heaven's sake to supersede him, for he cannot  exist in this state.\" Lord Nelson conducted the British case with the  Danes with consummate statesmanship, but notwithstanding this, the  fine sensitive nature of the noble fellow could not fail to be hurt  when His Majesty (the same who lost us America) stated that, \"under  _all_ the circumstances, he had thought well to approve.\" Nelson  replied that he was sorry the armistice was only approved under _all_  the circumstances, and then gives His Majesty a slap in the eye by  informing him that every part of the _all_ was to the advantage of the  King and Country. St. Vincent, the First Lord of the Admiralty,  subsequently made amends for His Majesty's error by writing to say  that his \"whole conduct was approved and admired, and that he does  not care to draw comparisons, but that everybody agrees there is only  one Nelson.\" This strong and valiant sailor was never at any time  unconscious of his power. What troubled him was other people's lack of  appreciation of it, though he accepted with a whimsical humour the  grudging spirit in which credit was given to his unerring judgment and  unequalled bravery. Nor can we examine the great deeds of his career  without feeling a thrill of pride in the knowledge that he belonged to  us.    The spirit which animated Nelson was the same as that which lived in  those heroes of old who were used by Providence as instruments in  their country's destiny, and we may believe that this same spirit will  live in those God-sent men of the future who will be necessary for the  carrying out of some special task or for the destruction of evil.  Apparently, long intervals elapse between the appearance of men such  as Napoleon or Nelson. Napoleon's name still stirs the blood, and now,  more than a century after his death, any one of the Powers who had a  share in his tragic end would give worlds to get back some of his  force and genius. Nelson in a much less degree and in a different way  was another of those sent by Providence to take part in his country's  struggles and, like many another great man, was subjected to cruel  indignities at the hands of his inferiors. He often complained about  his treatment, but this never prevented him from doing his work. But  as his instructions were not always in accordance with his view of  success, he occasionally disobeyed them for the country's good. It  might be a gain to borrow _his_ spirit for a while at the present time  to electrify the British Admiralty. Nelson was more successful in his  conflicts with the enemy than with the chiefs of his calling afloat  and ashore. He was not really strong and audacious enough in his  dealings with them. \"Jacky Fisher\" (as he is fondly called) who lives  in our disturbed time, would have had similar sandbags jettisoned in  quick time. The modern Nelson has had his troubles with inferior  superiors too, but he flattened out some of them. The modern man is  all business, and does not show vanity if he has any. The \"Only  Nelson\" was strong, weak, and vain. If no one else gratuitously  sounded his praises, he would do so himself in the most comical way,  not altogether in public, but to \"Santa Emma,\" whose function it was  to spread them abroad.    After the battle of Copenhagen, Sir Hyde Parker sailed for Carlscrona,  and left Nelson to hoist his flag as commander-in-chief on the _St.  George_, which was not ready, and was possibly being refitted after  rough handling. He tells Emma of Parker's departure, and adds, \"if  there is any work to do,\" i.e. any fighting, \"he is pretty certain  they will wait for him\" before commencing it. And then he adds,  \"_Nelson will be first_. Who can stop him?\" On the eve of the battle  of Copenhagen he wrote to her, \"Before you receive this, all will be  over with Denmark. Either your Nelson will be safe, and Sir Hyde  Parker victor, or your own Nelson will be laid low.\" What deep and  genuine love-lunacy to be found in a terrific warrior, whose very name  terrified those who had the honour to fight against him! The  incongruity of it baffles one's belief, and seems to reverse the very  order of human construction. In matters concerning his profession and  highly technical State affairs there was no more astute man, but as  soon as his thoughts centre on this female nightmare, he loses control  of his wonderful gifts, and his mind becomes deranged with the idea of  her being an object on which he should bestow reverence and infinite  adulation. If ever there was a creature of lamentable contradictions,  surely it was this genius, who immortalized our national glory at the  Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar! That a man of his calibre, surrounded  with eternal fame, should be inflamed with a passion for a woman of  negative morals who was refused admittance to the same circle that,  but for this attachment would receive him as their triumphant hero, is  an example of human eccentricity that never has and never can be  accounted for. It may be taken for granted that at the very time he  was writing to her about \"her own Nelson\" she would be carrying on a  love intrigue with some old or new acquaintance, possibly the Prince  of Wales, whom as I have said, her gallant lover wished her to avoid.  He was known to be a cheat, a liar, and a faithless friend to men and  to women, while in accordance with the splendid ethic of this type of  person, he believed himself to be possessed of every saintly virtue.  But any one who is curious to have a fascinating description of the  \"little dapper\" should consult Thackeray.    Well, there was no fighting to be done when the fleet under Nelson  arrived at Reval, and the Emperor Paul's death and the dilatoriness of  Parker saved the Russian fleet from extermination. They had sailed  into safer anchorage and the British Admiral had to content himself by  paying an official visit to the authorities at Reval, and receiving  another ovation from the populace, which appealed to his whimsical  love of approbation. As is his custom, he sends Emma an account of his  Reval experiences. He says he would not mention so personal an  incident to any one else, as it would appear so uncommonly like  vanity, but between her and himself, hundreds had come to have a look  at Nelson, and he heard them say, \"_That is him!_ That is _him_!\" It  touches his vanity so keenly that he follows on by intimating that he  \"feels a good name is better than riches, and that it has a fine  feeling to an honest heart.\" \"All the Russians,\" says he, \"are of  opinion that I am like Suwaroff, le Jeune Suwaroff.\" As may be  imagined, Nelson was bitterly disappointed at so sudden a collapse of  his hopes, but, always master of the situation, he wrote a most  courteous letter to Count Pahlen, the Russian Minister, who had  complained that his presence was calculated to make a breach of the  good feeling between the two countries. The Admiral's reply was  tactful and unconsciously humorous. The tone was that of a person who  had never been so unjustly hurt in his life. \"He had come to pay his  respects to His Imperial Majesty, and as his motives had been so  entirely misunderstood, he would put to sea at once.\"      VI    His health was beginning to feel the enormous strain that had been  imposed upon him for many months. This, together with his longing to  be in the congenial society of Lady Hamilton, caused him to ask to be  relieved of his command, and he was delighted to receive a letter from  his old chief, Lord St. Vincent, stating that it was almost an  impossible task to find a suitable successor, as in all his experience  he never knew any one, except Troubridge, who had the art of enthusing  others with his own unequalled spirit as he had. The command was  handed over to Sir Charles Pole, and Nelson, almost wild with joy,  sailed from the Baltic in the brig _Kite_ on the 19th June, and  arrived at Yarmouth on the 1st July, 1801. Nelson always claimed that  if the command had been given to him in February many lives would have  been saved, and our prestige would not have suffered.    We cannot describe all the fascinating pleasure we get when we read  and think of the wonders this strange mortal performed in the ordinary  course of his profession; when, however, he departs from that and  begins to make stagey love to Lady Hamilton, it tries one's Christian  patience. What business had he, as the first sailor in the world, to  enter into such a compact with another man's wife? However, he must  not be judged by this liaison alone, but by the circumstances that led  to it.    We know that his domestic life had been made irritating and unbearable  to his sensitive and highly strung nature, but he found in Emma  Hamilton one who played upon his vanity, and made him feel that he was  regarded as an idol as well as an idolatrous lover. He thirsted for  reverence and the love of soul for soul, and she, in her own way, gave  both with lavish profusion, whereas his wife's austere indifference to  his amazing accomplishments fell upon his large heart like ice, and  who can estimate his sufferings before he decided to defy society?

The witnesses on  both sides are examined by the justice, who decides according to law and  equity, as the right of the case may appear, in which he is said to  _give judgment_. To the amount of the judgment, whether against the  plaintiff or the defendant, are added the costs; for it is considered to  be just that the party in default shall pay the expense of the suit.  The costs consist of the _fees_ or compensation to be paid the justice,  constable and witnesses for their services.    Sec.11. If a defendant does not appear at the time of trial, the justice  may proceed to try the cause, and decide upon the testimony of the  plaintiff's witnesses. If a plaintiff does not answer or appear when his  name is called in court, the justice enters judgment of _nonsuit_. A  plaintiff may, at any time before judgment is rendered, discontinue or  withdraw his action, in which case also judgment of nonsuit is given. In  cases of nonsuit, and also when no cause of action is found, judgment is  rendered against the plantiff for the costs.    Sec.12. A debtor may avoid the expense of a lawsuit by _confessing  judgment_. The parties go before a justice, and the debtor acknowledges  or confesses the claim of the creditor, and consents that the justice  enter judgment accordingly. In some states, the confession and consent  must be in writing, and signed by the debtor. The amount for which  judgment may be confessed is limited by law, but is, in some states at  least, and perhaps in most if not all of them, larger than the sum to  which the jurisdiction of a justice is limited in ordinary suits.          Chapter XVIII.    Trial by Jury; Execution; Attachment; Appeals; Arrest of Offenders.        Sec.1. The administration of justice in courts of law is not left entirely  to the justices and judges. Parties may not always have sufficient  confidence in the ability, honesty, and impartiality of the justice by  whom a suit is to be tried, to intrust their interests to his judgment.  Therefore the constitutions of all the states guaranty to every person  the right of trial by a jury. This right has been enjoyed in England  many centuries. It was established here by our ancestors, who were  principally from that country.    Sec.2. A _jury_ is a number of men qualified and selected as the law  prescribes, and sworn to try a matter of fact, and to declare the truth  on the evidence given in the case. This declaring of the truth is called  a _verdict_, which is from the Latin _verum dictum_, a true declaration  or saying. A jury in a justice's court consists in most or all of the  states, as is believed, of six men; in the higher courts, of twelve men,  who are generally required to be freeholders. The manner of selecting  the jurors is not the same in all the states.    Sec.3. After issue has been joined, and before testimony has been heard,  either party may demand that the cause be tried by a jury. Whereupon the  justice issues a _venire_, which is a writ or precept directing a  constable to summon the required number of duly qualified men to appear  before the justice, to make a jury to try the cause.    Sec.4. The testimony and arguments on both sides having been heard, the  jurors are put under the charge of the constable, who is sworn to keep  them in some convenient place, without meat or drink, except such as the  justice may order, until they shall have agreed on their verdict, or  have been discharged by the justice; and not to allow any person to  speak to them during such time, nor to speak to them himself, except by  order of the justice, unless to ask them whether they have agreed on  their verdict.    Sec.5. All the jurors must agree in a verdict; and when so agreed, they  return in charge of the constable, and, in open court, deliver their  verdict to the justice, who enters judgment according to the finding of  the jury. If the jurors, after having been out a reasonable time, do not  all agree upon a verdict, the justice may discharge them, and issue a  new venire, unless the parties consent to submit the cause to the  justice.    Sec.6. If a judgment is not paid within the time prescribed by law, the  justice issues an _execution_, which is a precept directing a constable  to collect the amount of the judgment; and authorizing him to take and  sell the goods and chattels of the debtor, and to make his returns to  the justice within the time required. _Goods_ and _chattels_ are  personal or movable property, or property other than freehold, or real  estate. If the money can not be collected, the execution is returned as  not satisfied. If a constable does not faithfully obey the directions  contained in the execution, he and his sureties become liable to pay the  judgment.    Sec.7. Laws have been passed in all the states for the benefit of poor men,  who are allowed to retain, for the use and comfort of themselves and  their families, certain articles of personal property, which may not be  sold on execution; such as necessary household furniture, apparel, beds,  tools and implements of trade, &c. The practice which formerly  prevailed, of imprisoning debtors who were unable to satisfy executions,  has been abolished, except for fines and penalties.    Sec.8. The foregoing description of the proceedings of a justice's court is  that of a prosecution in ordinary cases. But there are other modes of  prosecution in certain cases, one of which is by attachment. An  _attachment_ is a writ directing the property of a debtor to be taken,  and kept till a trial can be had, and judgment obtained. This mode of  proceeding is adopted when the plaintiff has reason to believe that a  debtor conceals himself to avoid being prosecuted by summons, or is  about to remove his property or himself from the county, or intends in  some other way to defraud his creditors.    Sec.9. In case of an absent or concealed debtor, the constable, (as is  supposed to be the common practice,) leaves a copy of the attachment,  with an inventory or list of the articles of property attached, at the  defendant's last place of abode, or, if he had none in the county, the  copy and inventory are to be left with the person in whose possession  the property is found. If the defendant does not appear on the day of  trial, the plaintiff may proceed to prove his demand and take judgment.  An execution is then issued against the property attached.    Sec.10. If either party is dissatisfied with a judgment rendered in a  justice's court, he may _appeal_ to a higher court for trial, or for a  review of the judgment. The party appealing is called _appellant_; the  adverse party is the _appellee_ or _respondent_.    Sec.11. An important part of the duties of a justice of the peace relates  to the arrest and trial of persons charged with crimes and misdemeanors.  Although they have not power to try high offenses usually called crimes,  they may order the apprehension of persons charged with such offenses,  and cause them to be committed for trial.    Sec.12. A person knowing or suspecting another to have committed an  offense, may make complaint to a judge or justice of the peace, who  examines the complainant on oath, and witnesses, if any appear; and if  he is satisfied that an offense has been committed, he issues a  _warrant_, directing the person accused to be brought before him. The  complainant and witnesses for the prosecution, and next the prisoner and  his witnesses, are examined. If the offense is one of which the  magistrate has jurisdiction, he may proceed to try the prisoner, who, it  will be recollected, is entitled to be tried by a jury.    Sec.13. If the offense is one which the magistrate has not power to try, he  binds the prosecutor or complainant and all material witnesses to appear  and testify against the prisoner at the next court having power to  indict and try him. And if the offense is one for which the prisoner may  be bailed, the magistrate takes bail for his appearance at court. If the  offense is not bailable, or if no satisfactory bail is offered, the  magistrate orders him to be committed to jail to await his trial. But,  as will be seen hereafter, he must be indicted by a grand jury before he  can be tried. (Chap. XIX., Sec.7-9.) And were there no danger of an  offender's escape before he could be brought to trial, his previous  arrest and examination might be unnecessary.    Sec.14. The obligation or bond given by a prosecutor and witnesses for  their appearance at court, is sometimes called a _recognizance_. They  bind themselves, with sureties, to forfeit and pay a certain sum of  money in case of their non-appearance. A similar bond or recognizance is  given in case of bail. The person accused binds himself, with sureties,  in such sum as the justice requires, which is to be paid if he shall not  appear for trial. The word _bail_ is from a French word meaning _to  deliver_, or _to release_. Hence, the justice _bails_, sets free, or  delivers to his sureties, the party arrested. Also the sureties are said  to bail a person when they procure his liberation.          Chapter XIX.    Courts other than Justices' Courts; Grand and Petit Juries, &c.        Sec.1. The court next higher than a justice's court, is a court held in  each county, generally called a _county court_, or _court of common  pleas_. This court is usually held by a county judge elected by the  electors of the county in most of the states; in some, appointed by the  legislature; and in others, by the governor, with the advice and consent  of the senate. In a few of the states this court consists of more than  one judge. In some states, county courts are held by judges of the  circuit courts.    Sec.2. In this court are tried civil causes in which are claimed sums of  greater amount than a justice of the peace has jurisdiction of,"]]]
