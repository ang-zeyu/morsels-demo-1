The lad I never saw before, but her I know well; it  is my gammer _Dickison_.    _G. Dick._ Sirah, you have serv'd me well to swindge me thus. You yong  rogue, you have vs'd me like a dog.    _Boy._ When you had put your self into a dogs skin, I pray how c'ud I  help it; but gammer are not you a Witch? if you bee, I beg upon my  knees you will not hurt me.    _Dickis._ Stand up my boie, for thou shalt have no harme,  Be silent, speake of nothing thou hast seene.  And here's a shilling for thee.    _Boy._ Ile have none of your money, gammer, because you are a Witch;  and now she is out of her foure leg'd shape, ile see if with my two  legs I can out-run her.    _Dickis._ Nay sirra, though you be yong, and I old, you are not so  nimble, nor I so lame, but I can overtake you.    _Boy._ But Gammer what do you meane to do with me  Now you have me?    _Dickis._ To hugge thee, stroke thee, and embrace thee thus,  And teach thee twentie thousand prety things,  So thou tell no tales; and boy this night  Thou must along with me to a brave feast.    _Boy._ Not I gammer indeed la, I dare not stay out late,  My father is a fell man, and if I bee out long, will both  chide and beat me.    _Dickis._ Not sirra, then perforce thou shalt along,  This bridle helps me still at need,  And shall provide us of a steed.  Now sirra, take your shape and be  Prepar'd to hurrie him and me.    _Exit._    Now looke and tell mee wher's the lad become.    _Boy._ The boy is vanisht, and I can see nothing in his stead  But a white horse readie sadled and bridled.    _Dickis._ And thats the horse we must bestride,  On which both thou and I must ride,  Thou boy before and I behinde,  The earth we tread not, but the winde,  For we must progresse through the aire,  And I will bring thee to such fare  As thou ne're saw'st, up and away,  For now no longer we can stay.    _She catches him up, and turning round._    _Boy._ Help, help.    _Exit._\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"_Rob._ What place is this? it looks like an old barne: ile peep in at  some cranny or other, and try if I can see what they are doing.

I  doubt whether, in the whole Materia Medica, a more powerful  _Lamia-fuge_ could have been discovered, or one which would have been  more universally successful, if applied perseveringly, whenever the  suspicious symptoms recurred. The following is, however, Drage's great  panacea in these cases, a mode of treatment which must have been  vastly popular, judging from its extensive adoption in all parts of  the country: \"_Punish the witch, threaten to hang her if she helps not  the sick, scratch her and fetch blood.

We need not wonder; for a ball has been served  him, and he must return it to his companion. He is occupied in catching  it in its fall from the roof, to win a game. How can he think of his own  affairs, pray, when he has this other matter in hand? Here is a care  worthy of occupying this great soul, and taking away from him every  other thought of the mind. This man, born to know the universe, to judge  all causes, to govern a whole state, is altogether occupied and taken up  with the business of catching a hare. And if he does not lower himself  to this, and wants always to be on the strain, he will be more foolish  still, because he would raise himself above humanity; and after all he  is only a man, that is to say capable of little and of much, of all and  of nothing; he is neither angel nor brute, but man.]      141    Men spend their time in following a ball or a hare; it is the pleasure  even of kings.      142    _Diversion._--Is not the royal dignity sufficiently great in itself to  make its possessor happy by the mere contemplation of what he is? Must  he be diverted from this thought like ordinary folk? I see well that a  man is made happy by diverting him from the view of his domestic sorrows  so as to occupy all his thoughts with the care of dancing well. But will  it be the same with a king, and will he be happier in the pursuit of  these idle amusements than in the contemplation of his greatness? And  what more satisfactory object could be presented to his mind? Would it  not be a deprivation of his delight for him to occupy his soul with the  thought of how to adjust his steps to the cadence of an air, or of how  to throw a [ball] skilfully, instead of leaving it to enjoy quietly the  contemplation of the majestic glory which encompasses him? Let us make  the trial; let us leave a king all alone to reflect on himself quite at  leisure, without any gratification of the senses, without any care in  his mind, without society; and we will see that a king without  diversion is a man full of wretchedness. So this is carefully avoided,  and near the persons of kings there never fail to be a great number of  people who see to it that amusement follows business, and who watch all  the time of their leisure to supply them with delights and games, so  that there is no blank in it. In fact, kings are surrounded with persons  who are wonderfully attentive in taking care that the king be not alone  and in a state to think of himself, knowing well that he will be  miserable, king though he be, if he meditate on self.    In all this I am not talking of Christian kings as Christians, but only  as kings.      143    _Diversion._--Men are entrusted from infancy with the care of their  honour, their property, their friends, and even with the property and  the honour of their friends. They are overwhelmed with business, with  the study of languages, and with physical exercise;[71] and they are  made to understand that they cannot be happy unless their health, their  honour, their fortune and that of their friends be in good condition,  and that a single thing wanting will make them unhappy. Thus they are  given cares and business which make them bustle about from break of  day.--It is, you will exclaim, a strange way to make them happy! What  more could be done to make them miserable?--Indeed! what could be done?  We should only have to relieve them from all these cares; for then they  would see themselves: they would reflect on what they are, whence they  came, whither they go, and thus we cannot employ and divert them too  much. And this is why, after having given them so much business, we  advise them, if they have some time for relaxation, to employ it in  amusement, in play, and to be always fully occupied.    How hollow and full of ribaldry is the heart of man!      144    I spent a long time in the study of the abstract sciences, and was  disheartened by the small number of fellow-students in them. When I  commenced the study of man, I saw that these abstract sciences are not  suited to man, and that I was wandering farther from my own state in  examining them, than others in not knowing them. I pardoned their little  knowledge; but I thought at least to find many companions in the study  of man, and that it was the true study which is suited to him. I have  been deceived; still fewer study it than geometry. It is only from the  want of knowing how to study this that we seek the other studies. But is  it not that even here is not the knowledge which man should have, and  that for the purpose of happiness it is better for him not to know  himself?      145    [One thought alone occupies us; we cannot think of two things at the  same time. This is lucky for us according to the world, not according to  God.]      146    Man is obviously made to think. It is his whole dignity and his whole  merit; and his whole duty is to think as he ought. Now, the order of  thought is to begin with self, and with its Author and its end.    Now, of what does the world think? Never of this, but of dancing,  playing the lute, singing, making verses, running at the ring, etc.,  fighting, making oneself king, without thinking what it is to be a king  and what to be a man.      147    We do not content ourselves with the life we have in ourselves and in  our own being; we desire to live an imaginary life in the mind of  others, and for this purpose we endeavour to shine. We labour  unceasingly to adorn and preserve this imaginary existence, and neglect  the real. And if we possess calmness, or generosity, or truthfulness, we  are eager to make it known, so as to attach these virtues to that  imaginary existence. We would rather separate them from ourselves to  join them to it; and we would willingly be cowards in order to acquire  the reputation of being brave. A great proof of the nothingness of our  being, not to be satisfied with the one without the other, and to  renounce the one for the other! For he would be infamous who would not  die to preserve his honour.      148    We are so presumptuous that we would wish to be known by all the world,  even by people who shall come after, when we shall be no more; and we  are so vain that the esteem of five or six neighbours delights and  contents us.      149    We do not trouble ourselves about being esteemed in the towns through  which we pass. But if we are to remain a little while there, we are so  concerned. How long is necessary? A time commensurate with our vain and  paltry life.      150    Vanity is so anchored in the heart of man that a soldier, a soldier's  servant, a cook, a porter brags, and wishes to have his admirers. Even  philosophers wish for them. Those who write against it want to have the  glory of having written well;[72] and those who read it desire the glory  of having read it. I who write this have perhaps this desire, and  perhaps those who will read it ...      151    _Glory._--Admiration spoils all from infancy. Ah! How well said! Ah! How  well done! How well-behaved he is! etc.    The children of Port-Royal, who do not receive this stimulus of envy and  glory, fall into carelessness.      152    _Pride._--Curiosity is only vanity. Most frequently we wish to know but  to talk. Otherwise we would not take a sea voyage in order never to talk  of it, and for the sole pleasure of seeing without hope of ever  communicating it.      153    _Of the desire of being esteemed by those with whom we are._--Pride  takes such natural possession of us in the midst of our woes, errors,  etc. We even lose our life with joy, provided people talk of it.    Vanity: play, hunting, visiting, false shame, a lasting name.      154    [I have no friends] to your advantage].      155    A true friend is so great an advantage, even for the greatest lords, in  order that he may speak well of them, and back them in their absence,  that they should do all to have one. But they should choose well; for,  if they spend all their efforts in the interests of fools, it will be of  no use, however well these may speak of them; and these will not even  speak well of them if they find themselves on the weakest side, for  they have no influence; and thus they will speak ill of them in company.      156    _Ferox gens, nullam esse vitam sine armis rati._[73]--They prefer death  to peace; others prefer death to war.    Every opinion may be held preferable to life, the love of which is so  strong and so natural.[74]      157    Contradiction: contempt for our existence, to die for nothing, hatred of  our existence.      158    _Pursuits._--The charm of fame is so great, that we like every object to  which it is attached, even death.      159    Noble deeds are most estimable when hidden. When I see some of these in  history (as p. 184)[75], they please me greatly. But after all they have  not been quite hidden, since they have been known; and though people  have done what they could to hide them, the little publication of them  spoils all, for what was best in them was the wish to hide them.      160    Sneezing absorbs all the functions of the soul, as well as work does;  but we do not draw therefrom the same conclusions against the greatness  of man, because it is against his will. And although we bring it on  ourselves, it is nevertheless against our will that we sneeze. It is not  in view of the act itself; it is for another end. And thus it is not a  proof of the weakness of man, and of his slavery under that action.    It is not"]]]
