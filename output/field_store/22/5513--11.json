It is, however, by no means confined to  the parts near the town, as many were nesting in some ilex trees near  the house we had on L'Ancresse Common, although the house had been empty  since the previous summer, and the garden uncultivated; so food till we  came must have been rather scarce about there. As the wheat is coming  into ear the Sparrows, as in England, leave the neighbourhood of the  town and other buildings and spread themselves generally over the  country, for the purpose of devouring the young wheat while just coming  into ear and still soft. In Alderney, owing probably in a great measure  to the absence of cottages, farm-buildings, and stables at a distance  from the town, and also perhaps owing to the absence of hedges, it is  not so numerous in the open part, and consequently not so mischievous,  being mostly confined to the town, and to the buildings about the  harbour-works. The young wheat, however, is still a temptation, and is  accordingly punished by the Sparrows.    The House Sparrow is mentioned by Professor Ansted in his list, but no  letters are given marking the general distribution over the Islands,  probably because it is so generally spread over them. The local  Guernsey-French name is \"Grosbec,\" for which see Metivier's  'Dictionary.'      66. HAWFINCH. _Coccothraustes vulgaris_, Pallas. French, \"Grosbec.\"--The  Hawfinch or Grosbeak, as it is occasionally called, is by no means  common in Guernsey, and I have never seen it there myself, but I have a  skin of one killed in the Catel Parish in December, 1878; and Mr.  MacCulloch informs me it occasionally visits that Island in autumn, but  in consequence of its shy and retiring habits it has probably been  occasionally overlooked, and escaped the notice of the numerous gunners  to whom it would otherwise have more frequently fallen a victim. The  bird-stuffer and carpenter in Alderney had one spread out on a board and  hung up behind his door, which had been shot by his friend who shot the  Greenland Falcon, in the winter of 1876 and 1877, somewhere about  Christmas. I know no instance of its remaining to breed in the Islands,  though it may occasionally do so in Guernsey, as there are many places  suited to it, and in which it might well make its nest without being  observed. As it seems increasing in numbers throughout England, it is by  no means improbable that it will visit the Channel Islands more  frequently. The Hawfinch is included in Professor Ansted's list, and by  him marked as occurring only in Guernsey. There are two specimens in the  Museum.      67. GREENFINCH. _Coccothraustes chloris_, Linnaeus. French, \"Grosbec  verdier,\" \"Verdier ordinaire.\"--The Greenfinch is a common resident, and  breeds in all the Islands, but is certainly not quite so common as in  England. It is more numerous perhaps in Guernsey and Sark than in  Alderney; it is also pretty common in Jethou and Herm.    It is included in Professor Ansted's list, but only marked as occurring  in Guernsey and Sark. There is no specimen in the Museum.      68. GOLDFINCH. _Carduelis elegans_, Stephens. French, \"Chardonneret,\"  \"Grosbec chardonneret.\"--The Goldfinch is resident in and breeds in all  the Islands. In Guernsey I was told a few years ago that it had been  much more numerous than it then was, the bird-catchers having had a good  deal to answer for in having shortened its numbers. It is now, however,  again increasing its numbers, as I saw many more this year (1878) than I  had seen before at any time of year. There were several about the Grand  Mare, and probably had nests there, and I saw an old pair, with their  brood out, at St. George on the 5th of June, and soon after another  brood about Mr. De Putron's pond, where they were feeding on the seeds  of some thistles which were growing on the rough ground about the pond.  I have also seen a few in Alderney; and Captain Hubbach writes me word  that the Goldfinch was quite plentiful here (Alderney) in the winter of  1862 and 1863. But he adds--\"I have not seen one here this year.\" So  probably its numbers are occasionally increased by migratory flocks in  the winter.    Professor Ansted includes the Goldfinch in his list, but marks it as  occurring only in Guernsey and Sark. There is no specimen in the Museum.      69. SISKIN. _Carduelis spinus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Tarin,\" \"Grosbec  tarin.\"--The Siskin can only be looked upon as an occasional, accidental  visitant--indeed, I only know of one instance of its occurrence, and  that is recorded by Mr. Couch at p. 4296 of the 'Zoologist' for 1875 in  the following words:--\"I have the first recognised specimen of the  Siskin; a boy knocked it down with a stone in an orchard at the Vrangue  in September.\" This communication is dated November, 1874. I have never  seen the Siskin in any of the Channel Islands myself, and Mr. MacCulloch  writes me word--\"I have never heard of a Siskin here, but, being  migratory, it may occur.\" I see, however, no reason to doubt Mr.  Couch's statement in the 'Zoologist,' as the bird was brought into his  shop. He must have had plenty of opportunity of identifying it, though  he does not tell us whether he preserved it. There can, however, be no  possible reason why the Siskin should not occasionally visit Guernsey on  migration, as it extends its southern journey through Spain to the  Mediterranean and across to the North-western Coast of Africa; and the  Channel Islands would seem to lie directly in its way.    The Siskin, however, is not mentioned in Professor Ansted's list, and  there is no specimen at present in the Museum.      70. LINNET. _Linota cannabina_, Linnaeus. French, \"Linotte,\" \"Grosbec  linotte.\"--The Linnet is resident and the most numerous bird in the  Islands by far, outnumbering even the House Sparrow, and it is equally  common and breeds in all the Islands. The Channel Islands Linnets always  appear to me extremely bright-coloured, the scarlet on the head and  breast during the breeding-season being brighter than in any British  birds I have ever seen. Though the Linnet is itself so numerous, it is,  as far as I have been able to ascertain, the only representative of its  family to be found in the Channel Islands; at least I have never seen  and had no information of the occurrence of either the Lesser Redpole,  the Mealy Redpole, or the Twite, though I can see no reason why each of  these birds should not occasionally occur.    The Linnet is included in Professor Ansted's list, but marked by him as  only occurring in Guernsey and Sark; and there is a specimen in the  Museum.      71. BULLFINCH. _Pyrrhula europaea_, Vieillot. French, \"Bovreuil  commun.\"--Miss C.B. Carey, in the 'Zoologist' for 1874, mentions a  Bullfinch having been brought into Couch's shop in November of that  year, and adds--\"This bird is much more common in Jersey than it is  here.\" Miss Carey is certainly right as to its not being common in  Guernsey, as I have never seen the bird on any of my expeditions to that  Island, nor have I seen it in either of the other Islands which come  within my district.    Professor Ansted includes the Bullfinch in his list, but oddly enough  only marks it as occurring in Guernsey and Sark, although Mr. Gallienne,  in his remarks published with the list, says--\"The Bullfinch  occasionally breeds in Jersey, but is rarely seen in Guernsey,\" so far  agreeing with Miss Carey's note in the 'Zoologist,' but he does not add  anything about Sark. There is no specimen in the Museum.      72. COMMON CROSSBILL. _Loxia curvirostra_, Linnaeus. French,  \"Bec-croise,\" \"Bec-croise commun.\"--The Crossbill is an occasional  visitant to all the Islands, and sometimes in considerable numbers, but,  as in England, it is perfectly irregular as to the time of year it  chooses for its visits. Mr. MacCulloch writes me word--\"The Crossbill is  most uncertain in its visits. Many years will sometimes pass without a  single one being heard of. When they do come it is generally in large  flocks. I have known them arrive in early autumn, and do great havoc  amongst the apples, which they cut up to get at the pips. Sometimes they  make their appearance in the winter, seemingly driven from the Continent  by the cold.\"    My first acquaintance with the Crossbill was in Sark on the 25th of  June, 1866, when I saw a very fine red-plumaged bird in a small  fir-plantation in the grounds of the Lord of Sark. It was very tame, and  allowed me to approach it very closely. I did not see any others at that  time amongst the fir-trees, though no doubt a few others were there. On  my return to Guernsey on the following day I was requested by a  bird-catcher to name some birds that were doing considerable damage in  the gardens about the town. Thinking from having seen the one in Sark,  and from his description, that the birds might be Crossbills, I asked  him to get me one or two, which he said he could easily do, as the  people were destroying them on account of the damage they did. In a day  or two he brought me one live and two dead Crossbills, and told me that  as many as forty had been shot in one person's garden. The two dead ones  he brought me were one in red and the other in green plumage, and the  live one was in green plumage. This one I brought home and kept in my  aviary till March, 1868, when it was killed by a Hawk striking it  through the wires. It was, however, still in the same green plumage when  it was killed as it was when I brought it home, though it had moulted  twice.    The Crossbill did not appear at that time to be very well known in  Guernsey, as neither the bird-catcher nor the people in whose gardens  the birds were had ever seen them before or knew what they were. This  year (1866), however, appears to have been rather an exceptional year  with regard to Crossbills, as I find some recorded in the 'Zoologist'  from Norfolk, the Isle of Wight, Sussex, and Henley-on-Tham"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14474"],[0,"The Chemical History of a Candle (#13)"],[1,"question, and one I shall endeavour to make you  understand: it relates most intimately to the nature of the atmosphere,  and is most important to us.    We have several tests for oxygen besides the mere burning of bodies. You  have seen a candle burnt in oxygen, or in the air; you have seen  phosphorus burnt in the air, or in oxygen; and you have seen iron-filings  burnt in oxygen. But we have other tests besides these, and I am about to  refer to one or two of them for the purpose of carrying your conviction  and your experience further. Here we have a vessel of oxygen. I will shew  its presence to you: if I take a little spark and put it into that oxygen,  you know, by the experience you gained the last time we met, what will  happen; if I put that spark into the jar, it will tell you whether we have  oxygen here or not. Yes! We have proved it by combustion; and now here is  another test for oxygen, which is a very curious and useful one. I have  here two jars full of gas, with a plate between them to prevent their  mixing; I take the plate away, and the gases are creeping one into the  other. \"What happens?\" say you: \"they together produce no such combustion  as was seen in the case of the candle.\" But see how the presence of oxygen  is told by its association with this other substance[14]. What a  beautifully coloured gas I have obtained in this way, shewing me the  presence of the oxygen! In the same way we can try this experiment by  mixing common air with this test-gas. Here is a jar containing air--such  air as the candle would burn in--and here is a jar or bottle containing  the test-gas. I let them come together over water, and you see the result:  the contents of the test-bottle are flowing into the jar of air, and you  see I obtain exactly the same kind of action as before, and that shews me  that there is oxygen in the air--the very same substance that has been  already obtained by us from the water produced by the candle. But then,  beyond that, how is it that the candle does not burn in air as well as in  oxygen? We will come to that point at once. I have here two jars; they are  filled to the same height with gas, and the appearance to the eye is alike  in both, and I really do not know at present which of these jars contains  oxygen and which contains air, although I know they have previously been  filled with these gases. But here is our test-gas, and I am going to work  with the two jars, in order to examine whether there is any difference  between them in the quality of reddening this gas. I am now going to turn  this test-gas into one of the jars, and observe what happens. There is  reddening, you see; there is then oxygen present. We will now test the  other jar; but you see this is not so distinctly red as the first: and,  further, this curious thing happens,--if I take these two gases and shake  them well together with water, we shall absorb the red gas; and then, if I  put in more of this test-gas and shake again, we shall absorb more; and I  can go on as long as there be any oxygen present to produce that effect.  If I let in air, it will not matter; but the moment I introduce water, the  red gas disappears; and I may go on in this way, putting in more and more  of the test-gas, until I come to something left behind which will not  redden any longer by the use of that particular body that rendered the air  and the oxygen red. Why is that? You see in a moment it is because there  is, besides oxygen, something else present which is left behind. I will  let a little more air into the jar, and if it turns red you will know that  some of that reddening gas is still present, and that consequently it was  not for the want of this producing body that that air was left behind.    Now, you will begin to understand what I am about to say. You saw that  when I burnt phosphorus in a jar, as the smoke produced by the phosphorus  and the oxygen of the air condensed, it left a good deal of gas unburnt,  just as this red gas left something untouched,--there was, in fact, this  gas left behind, which the phosphorus cannot touch, which the reddening  gas cannot touch, and this something is not oxygen, and yet is part of the  atmosphere.    So that is one way of opening out air into the two things of which it is  composed--oxygen, which burns our candles, our phosphorus, or anything  else; and this other substance--nitrogen--which will not burn them. This  other part of the air is by far the larger proportion, and it is a very  curious body, when we come to examine it; it is remarkably curious, and  yet you say, perhaps, that it is very uninteresting. It is uninteresting  in some respects because of this--that it shews no brilliant effects of  combustion.  If I test it with a taper as I do oxygen and hydrogen, it  does not burn like hydrogen, nor does it make the taper burn like oxygen.  Try it in any way I will, it does neither the one thing nor the other: it  will not take fire; it will not let the taper burn; it puts out the  combustion of everything. There is nothing that will burn in it in common  circumstances. It has no smell; it is not sour; it does not dissolve in  water; it is neither an acid nor an alkali; it is as indifferent to all  our organs as it is possible for a thing to be. And you might say, \"It is  nothing; it is not worth chemical attention; what does it do in the air?\"  Ah! then come our beautiful and fine results shewn us by an observant  philosophy.  Suppose, in place of having nitrogen, or nitrogen and oxygen,  we had pure oxygen as our atmosphere; what would become of us? You know  very well that a piece of iron lit in a jar of oxygen goes on burning to  the end. When you see a fire in an iron grate, imagine where the grate  would go to if the whole of the atmosphere were oxygen. The grate would  burn up more powerfully than the coals--for the iron of the grate itself  is even more combustible than the coals which we burn in it. A fire put  into the middle of a locomotive would be a fire in a magazine of fuel, if  the atmosphere were oxygen. The nitrogen lowers it down and makes it  moderate and useful for us, and then, with all that, it takes away with it  the fumes that you have seen produced from the candle, disperses them  throughout the whole of the atmosphere, and carries them away to places  where they are wanted to perform a great and glorious purpose of good to  man, for the sustenance of vegetation; and thus does a most wonderful  work, although you say, on examining it, \"Why, it is a perfectly  indifferent thing.\" This nitrogen in its ordinary state is an inactive  element; no action short of the most intense electric force, and then in  the most infinitely small degree, can cause the nitrogen to combine  directly with the other element of the atmosphere, or with other things  round about it; it is a perfectly indifferent, and therefore to say, a  safe substance.    But before I take you to that result, I must tell you about the atmosphere  itself. I have written on this diagram the composition of one hundred  parts of atmospheric air:--                      Bulk.  Weight.  Oxygen, . . . . .   20    22.3  Nitrogen, . . . .   80    77.7                    ----   -----                     l00   100.0    It is a true analysis of the atmosphere, so far as regards the quantity of  oxygen and the quantity of nitrogen present. By our analysis, we find that  5 pints of the atmosphere contain only 1 pint of oxygen, and 4 pints, or 4  parts, of nitrogen by bulk. That is our analysis of the atmosphere. It  requires all that quantity of nitrogen to reduce the oxygen down, so as to  be able to supply the candle properly with fuel, so as to supply us with  an atmosphere which our lungs can healthily and safely breathe; for it is  just as important to make the oxygen right for us to breathe, as it is to  make the atmosphere right for the burning of the fire and the candle.    But now for this atmosphere. First of all, let me tell you the weight of  these gases. A pint of nitrogen weighs 10-4/10 grains, or a cubic foot  weighs 1-1/6 ounce. That is the weight of the nitrogen. The oxygen is  heavier: a pint of it weighs 11-9/10 grains, and a cubic foot weighs 1-3/4  ounce. A pint of air weighs about 10-7/10 grains, and a cubic foot 1-1/5  ounce.    [Illustration: Fig. 25.]    You have asked me several times, and I am very glad you have, \"How do you  weigh gases?\" I will shew you; it is very simple, and easily done. Here is  a balance, and here a copper bottle, made as light as we can consistent  with due strength, turned very nicely in the lathe, and made perfectly  air-tight, with a stop-cock, which we can open and shut, which at present  is open, and therefore allows the bottle to be full of air. I have here a  nicely-adjusted balance, in which I think the bottle, in its present  condition, will be balanced by the weight on the other side. And here is a  pump by which we can force the air into this bottle, and with it we will  force in a certain number of volumes of air, as measured by the pump.  [Twenty measures were pumped in.] We will shut that in and put it in the  balance. See how it sinks: it is much heavier than it was. By what?  By  the air that we have forced into it by the pump. There is not a greater  _bulk_ of air, but there is the same bulk of _heavier_ air, because we  have forced in air upon it. And that you may have a fair notion in your  mind as to how much this air measures, here is a jar full of water. We  will open that copper vessel into this jar, and let the air return to its  former state. All I have to do now is to screw them tightly together, and  to turn the taps, when there, you see, is the bulk of the twenty pumps of  air which I forced into the bottle; and to make sure that we have been  quite correct in what we have been doing, we will take the bottle again to  the balance, and, if it is now counterpoised by the original weight, we  shall be"]]]
