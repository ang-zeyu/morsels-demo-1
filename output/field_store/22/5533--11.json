So I told him, and said I was sorry I  wasn't ready for him, and he didn't answer a word, but just looked at me  as grave as a judge, and turned round and walked out of the room.\"    \"Surely, my dear Zoe, Edward does not insist upon his little wife learning  lessons whether she is willing or not?\" Elsie said inquiringly, and with a  gentle caress.    \"Oh, no, no, mamma! it has been my own choice, and I've no wish to give it  up; but somehow there is always something interfering with my studying.  Somebody calls, or I'm inclined for a ride, a drive or a walk, or I get  engaged in sewing or fancy work, or my music, or a story-book that's too  interesting to lay down till I reach the end. Mamma, I often wonder how it  is that you find time for all these things and many others beside.\"    \"Shall I tell you the secret of managing it, dear?\" Elsie asked, with an  affectionate look and smile into the tear-stained face now uplifted to  hers.    Zoe gave an eager assent, and Elsie went on:    \"It lies in doing things systematically, always putting duties first,  giving to each its set time, and letting the pleasures come in afterward.  If I were you, my dear, I should have a regular study hour, putting it  early in the day, before callers begin to come, and I should not allow it  to be lightly interfered with; no stitch should be taken in fancy work,  no novel opened, no story paper glanced at, until each lesson for the day  was fully prepared.\"    Zoe's face had brightened very much as she listened.    \"O mamma, I see that that is just the way to do it!\" she cried, clapping  her hands with glee, \"and I'll begin at once. I'll think over all the  daily duties and make out a regular programme, and----\"    \"Strive earnestly to carry it out, you would say, yet not in your own  strength alone,\" Elsie added, as Zoe paused, leaving her sentence  unfinished.    \"Yes, mamma,\" she responded in a more serious tone. \"And now, I'll run  back to my room and try to be ready for Edward when he comes in again.\"    She set herself to her tasks with unwonted determination to give her whole  mind to them. Edward came in at length, and was greeted with a bright look  and the announcement in a tone of great satisfaction, \"I'm quite ready for  you now.\"    \"I've been thinking we might perhaps as well give it up, Zoe,\" he answered  gravely, \"at least for the present, until you are done working upon those  very fascinating Christmas things.\"    \"Oh no, don't!\" she said, flushing and looking ready to cry, \"try me a  little longer, Ned; I've been talking with mamma, and I'm really going to  turn over a new leaf and do just as she advises.\"    \"Ah, if you have taken mamma into your counsels there is some hope,\" he  said in a tone of hearty approval. \"But we will have to put off the  recitations until after tea. I must drive over to the Oaks to see Uncle  Horace about a business matter, and I just came up to ask you to go  along.\"    \"Oh, I'll be happy to!\" she cried joyously, pushing the books aside and  starting to her feet, \"and it won't take me a minute to don hat and  cloak.\"    He caught her in his arms as she was rushing past him, and kissing her on  cheek and lips, asked in tender tones, \"Have I made you unhappy this  afternoon, my love, my darling?\"    \"Yes, for a little while; but I deserved it, Ned, and I don't mind it now  if--if only you love your foolish, careless little wife as well as ever in  spite of all her faults.\"    \"I love you dearly, dearly, my one own peculiar treasure,\" he responded,  with another caress of ardent affection, as he let her go.    She was gay and happy as a bird during their drive, and full of enthusiasm  in regard to her new plan, explaining it to Edward, and asking his advice  about the best division of her time, how much should be allotted to this  duty and how much to that.    \"I mean to rise earlier,\" she said, \"and if I can't get time in that way  for all I want to do, I'll shorten my rides and walks.\"    \"No,\" he said, \"I'm not going to have your health sacrificed even to  mental improvement; and certainly not to fancy work; I shall insist on  plenty of rest and sleep and abundance of exercise in the open air for the  dear little woman I have taken charge of.\"    \"Then, sir, you're not to be cross if the studies are not attended to.\"    \"They will be if put before novels, fancy work, and other equally  unnecessary employments.\"    \"Well, I've said they shall be in future. O Ned,\" and she nestled closer  to his side, looking up lovingly into his face, \"it's ever so nice to have  somebody to take care of me and love me as you do! How could I ever do  without papa, who always petted me so, if I hadn't you?\"    \"I hope you may never find out. I hope I may be spared to take care of  you, as long as you need me, little wife,\" he said, pressing her closer to  his side.    Rosie met them in the hall on their return to Ion.    \"It's most tea time, Zoe,\" she said; \"I think you'll not have any too much  time for changing your dress.\"    \"Then I must needs make haste,\" returned Zoe, tripping up the stairs.    Edward, who was taking off his overcoat, turned a rather surprised,  inquiring glance upon his little sister.    \"Oh, yes,\" she said laughingly, \"I had a reason for hurrying her away,  because I want to tell you something. Cousin Ronald Lilburn is coming.  Maybe he will be here by to-morrow. Mamma heard he wasn't well, and she  wrote and invited him to come and spend the winter with us, and she's just  had a letter saying he will come. Aren't you glad, Ned?\"    \"I'm very well pleased, Rosie, but why shouldn't Zoe have heard your  announcement?\"    \"Because I wanted to warn you first not to tell her or the Raymonds  something (you know what) that must be kept secret at first, if we want to  have some fun.\"    \"Oh, yes!\" he said, with a good-humored laugh. \"Well, I think you may  trust me not to tell. But how about all the others? Walter, especially?\"    \"Oh, he doesn't remember anything about it; and grandpa and mamma and all  the rest have promised not to tell.\"    \"And you are quite sure Rosie may be trusted not to let the secret slip  out unintentionally?\" he asked, pinching her round rosy cheek.    \"I hope so,\" she said, laughing and running away.    Opening the library door and seeing Lulu there curled up in the corner of  a sofa with a book, she stepped in, shutting the door behind her.    Lulu looked up.    \"Shall I disturb you if I talk?\" asked Rose.    \"I'm ready to listen,\" answered Lulu, half closing her book. \"What have  you to say?\"    \"Oh, that Cousin Ronald Lilburn is coming, and I'm ever so glad, as you  would be, too, if you knew him.\"    \"I never heard of him,\" said Lulu. \"Is he a boy? is he older than Max?\"    \"I should think so!\" cried Rosie, with a merry laugh. \"He has grown-up  sons, and he looks a good deal older than grandpa.\"    \"Pooh! then why should I care about his coming!\" exclaimed Lulu, in a tone  of mingled impatience and contempt.    \"Why, because he's very nice and kind to us children, and tells us the  loveliest stories about the brownies in Scotland and about Bruce and  Wallace and the black Douglass and Robin Hood and his merry men, and--oh,  I can't tell you what all!\"    \"Oh, that must be ever so nice!\" cried Lulu, now as much pleased and  interested in the news of the expected arrival as Rosie could desire.          CHAPTER X.    IN WHICH THE CHILDREN HAVE SOME FUN.      In the uppermost story of the house at Ion was a large play-room furnished  with a great variety of toys and games--indeed almost everything that  could be thought of for the amusement of the young folks, from Walter up  to Max.    But the greatest delight of the last named was in the deft handling of the  tools in an adjoining apartment, called the boys' work-room. There he  found abundance of material to work upon, holly scroll and fret saws, and  a well-stocked tool chest.    Edward had given him a few lessons at the start, and now he had become so  expert as to be turning out some really beautiful pieces of carving, which  he intended to give to his friends at Christmas.    Lulu, too, was learning scroll-sawing, and thought it far preferable to  any sort of needle-work; sometimes more enjoyable than playing with her  dolls.    They were there together one afternoon, both very busy and chatting and  laughing as they worked.    \"Max,\" said Lulu, \"I'm determined to learn to do scroll-sawing and carving  just as well as ever I can, and make lovely things! Maybe I can contrive  new patterns or designs, or whatever they call 'em, and after a while make  ever so much money, enough to pay for my clothes and everything, so that  papa won't have to spend any of his money on me.\"    \"Why, Lu!\" exclaimed her brother, \"do you think papa grudges the money he  spends on you, or any of us?\"    \"No, I know he doesn't,\" she returned vehemently, \"but can't you  understand that I'd like him to have more to spend on himself?\"    \"Oh,\" said Max. \"Well, that's right, I'm sure, and very thoughtful for a  little girl like you. I do think you're splendid in some ways, Lu.\"    \"And whether you make money by it or not, it will be a good thing to learn  to do this work well. Papa says, 'knowledge is power,' and the more things  we know how to do, the more independent and useful we will be.\"    Just then the door opened, and Zoe, in riding hat and habit, put in her  head.    \"Max, I'm going to ride into the village,\" she said, \"and Edward can't go  with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14916"],[0,"Fairy Tales Every Child Should Know (#13)"],[1,"mace-bearer, and when she reached the sultan bowed her head down to the  carpet which covered the platform of the throne, and remained in that  posture until he bade her rise, which she had no sooner done, than he  said to her, \"Good woman, I have observed you to stand many days from  the beginning to the rising of the divan; what business brings you  here?\"    After these words, Aladdin's mother prostrated herself a second time;  and when she arose, said, \"Monarch of monarchs, I beg of you to pardon  the boldness of my petition, and to assure me of your pardon and  forgiveness.\" \"Well,\" replied the sultan, \"I will forgive you, be it  what it may, and no hurt shall come to you; speak boldly.\"    When Aladdin's mother had taken all these precautions, for fear of the  sultan's anger, she told him faithfully the errand on which her son had  sent her, and the event which led to his making so bold a request in  spite of all her remonstrances.    The sultan hearkened to this discourse without showing the least anger;  but before he gave her any answer, asked her what she had brought tied  up in the napkin. She took the china dish which she had set down at the  foot of the throne, untied it, and presented it to the sultan.    The sultan's amazement and surprise were inexpressible, when he saw so  many large, beautiful and valuable jewels collected in the dish. He  remained for some time lost in admiration. At last, when he had  recovered himself, he received the present from Aladdin's mother's hand;  saying, \"How rich, how beautiful!\" After he had admired and handled all  the jewels one after another, he turned to his grand vizier, and showing  him the dish, said, \"Behold, admire, wonder! and confess that your eyes  never beheld jewels so rich and beautiful before.\" The vizier was  charmed. \"Well,\" continued the sultan, \"what sayest thou to such a  present? Is it not worthy of the princess my daughter? And ought I not  to bestow her on one who values her at so great a price?\" \"I cannot but  own,\" replied the grand vizier, \"that the present is worthy of the  princess; but I beg of your majesty to grant me three months before you  come to a final resolution. I hope, before that time, my son, whom you  have regarded with your favour, will be able to make a nobler present  than this Aladdin, who is an entire stranger to your majesty.\"    The sultan granted his request, and he said to the old woman, \"Good  woman, go home, and tell your son that I agree to the proposal you have  made me; but I cannot marry the princess my daughter for three months;  at the expiration of that time come again.\"    Aladdin's mother returned home much more gratified than she had  expected, and told her son with much joy the condescending answer she  had received from the sultan's own mouth; and that she was to come to  the divan again that day three months.    Aladdin thought himself the most happy of all men at hearing this news,  and thanked his mother for the pains she had taken in the affair, the  good success of which was of so great importance to his peace, that he  counted every day, week, and even hour as it passed. When two of the  three months were passed, his mother one evening, having no oil in the  house, went out to buy some, and found a general rejoicing--the houses  dressed with foliage, silks, and carpeting, and every one striving to  show their joy according to their ability. The streets were crowded with  officers in habits of ceremony, mounted on horses richly caparisoned,  each attended by a great many footmen. Aladdin's mother asked the oil  merchant what was the meaning of all this preparation of public  festivity. \"Whence came you, good woman,\" said he, \"that you don't know  that the grand vizier's son is to marry the Princess Buddir al Buddoor,  the sultan's daughter, to-night? She will presently return from the  bath; and these officers whom you see are to assist at the cavalcade to  the palace, where the ceremony is to be solemnised.\"    Aladdin's mother, on hearing these news, ran home very quickly. \"Child,\"  cried she, \"you are undone! the sultan's fine promises will come to  nought. This night the grand vizier's son is to marry the Princess  Buddir al Buddoor.\"    At this account, Aladdin was thunderstruck, and he bethought himself of  the lamp, and of the genie who had promised to obey him; and without  indulging in idle words against the sultan, the vizier, or his son, he  determined, if possible, to prevent the marriage.    When Aladdin had got into his chamber, he took the lamp, rubbed it in  the same place as before, when immediately the genie appeared, and said  to him, \"What wouldst thou have? I am ready to obey thee as thy slave;  I, and the other slaves of the lamp.\" \"Hear me,\" said Aladdin; \"thou  hast hitherto obeyed me, but now I am about to impose on thee a harder  task. The sultan's daughter, who was promised me as my bride, is this  night married to the son of the grand vizier. Bring them both hither to  me immediately they retire to their bedchamber.\"    \"Master,\" replied the genie, \"I obey you.\"    Aladdin supped with his mother as was their wont, and then went to his  own apartment, and sat up to await the return of the genie, according to  his commands.    In the mean time the festivities in honour of the princess's marriage  were conducted in the sultan's palace with great magnificence. The  ceremonies were at last brought to a conclusion, and the princess and  the son of the vizier retired to the bedchamber prepared for them. No  sooner had they entered it, and dismissed their attendants, than the  genie, the faithful slave of the lamp, to the great amazement and alarm  of the bride and bridegroom, took up the bed, and by an agency invisible  to them, transported it in an instant into Aladdin's chamber, where he  set it down. \"Remove the bridegroom,\" said Aladdin to the genie, \"and  keep him a prisoner till to-morrow dawn, and then return with him here.\"  On Aladdin being left alone with the princess, he endeavoured to assuage  her fears, and explained to her the treachery practiced upon him by the  sultan her father. He then laid himself down beside her, putting a drawn  scimitar between them, to show that he was determined to secure her  safety, and to treat her with the utmost possible respect. At break of  day, the genie appeared at the appointed hour, bringing back the  bridegroom, whom by breathing upon he had left motionless and entranced  at the door of Aladdin's chamber during the night, and at Aladdin's  command transported the couch with the bride and bridegroom on it, by  the same invisible agency, into the palace of the sultan.    At the instant that the genie had set down the couch with the bride and  bridegroom in their own chamber, the sultan came to the door to offer  his good wishes to his daughter. The grand vizier's son, who was almost  perished with cold, by standing in his thin under-garment all night, no  sooner heard the knocking at the door than he got out of bed, and ran  into the robing-chamber, where he had undressed himself the night  before.    The sultan having opened the door, went to the bedside, kissed the  princess on the forehead, but was extremely surprised to see her look so  melancholy. She only cast at him a sorrowful look, expressive of great  affliction. He suspected there was something extraordinary in this  silence, and thereupon went immediately to the sultaness's apartment,  told her in what a state he found the princess, and how she had received  him. \"Sire,\" said the sultaness, \"I will go and see her; she will not  receive me in the same manner.\"    The princess received her mother with sighs and tears, and signs of deep  dejection. At last, upon her pressing on her the duty of telling her all  her thoughts, she gave to the sultaness a precise description of all  that happened to her during the night; on which the sultaness enjoined  on her the necessity of silence and discretion, as no one would give  credence to so strange a tale. The grand vizier's son, elated with the  honour of being the sultan's son-in-law, kept silence on his part, and  the events of the night were not allowed to cast the least gloom on the  festivities on the following day, in continued celebration of the royal  marriage.    When night came, the bride and bridegroom were again attended to their  chamber with the same ceremonies as on the preceding evening. Aladdin,  knowing that this would be so, had already given his commands to the  genie of the lamp; and no sooner were they alone than their bed was  removed in the same mysterious manner as on the preceding evening; and  having passed the night in the same unpleasant way, they were in the  morning conveyed to the palace of the sultan. Scarcely had they been  replaced in their apartment, when the sultan came to make his  compliments to his daughter, when the princess could no longer conceal  from him the unhappy treatment she had been subject to, and told him all  that had happened as she had already related it to her mother. The  sultan, on hearing these strange tidings, consulted with the grand  vizier; and finding from him that his son had been subjected to even  worse treatment by an invisible agency, he determined to declare the  marriage to be cancelled, and all the festivities, which were yet to  last for several days, to be countermanded and terminated.    This sudden change in the mind of the sultan gave rise to various  speculations and reports. Nobody but Aladdin knew the secret, and he  kept it with the most scrupulous silence; and neither the sultan nor the  grand vizier, who had forgotten Aladdin and his request, had the least  thought that he had any hand in the strange adventures that befell the  bride and bridegroom.    On the very day that the three months contained in the sultan's promise  expired, the mother of Aladdin again went to the palace, and stood in  the same place in the divan. The sultan"]]]
