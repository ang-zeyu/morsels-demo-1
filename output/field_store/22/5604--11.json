For a little reward men make a long journey; for eternal life  many will scarce lift a foot once from the ground.  Mean reward  is sought after; for a single piece of money sometimes there is  shameful striving; for a thing which is vain and for a trifling  promise, men shrink not from toiling day and night.\"    4. \"But, O shame! for an unchangeable good, for an inestimable  reward, for the highest honour and for a glory that fadeth not  away, it is irksome to them to toil even a little.  Be thou  ashamed therefore, slothful and discontented servant, for they  are found readier unto perdition than thou unto life.  They  rejoice more heartily in vanity than thou in the truth.  Sometimes, indeed, they are disappointed of their hope, but my  promise faileth no man, nor sendeth away empty him who trusteth  in Me.  What I have promised I will give; what I have said I will  fulfil; if only a man remain faithful in My love unto the end.  Therefore am I the rewarder of all good men, and a strong  approver of all who are godly.    5. \"Write My words in thy heart and consider them diligently, for  they shall be very needful to thee in time of temptation.  What  thou understandest not when thou readest, thou shalt know in the  time of thy visitation.  I am wont to visit Mine elect in twofold  manner, even by temptation and by comfort, and I teach them two  lessons day by day, the one in chiding their faults, the other in  exhorting them to grow in grace.  He who hath My words and  rejecteth them, hath one who shall judge him at the last day.\"      A PRAYER FOR THE SPIRIT OF DEVOTION    6. O Lord my God, Thou art all my good, and who am I that I  should dare to speak unto Thee?  I am the very poorest of Thy  servants, an abject worm, much poorer and more despicable than I  know or dare to say.  Nevertheless remember, O Lord, that I am  nothing, I have nothing, and can do nothing.  Thou only art good,  just and holy; Thou canst do all things, art over all things,  fillest all things, leaving empty only the sinner.  Call to mind  Thy tender mercies, and fill my heart with Thy grace, Thou who  wilt not that Thy work should return to Thee void.    7. How can I bear this miserable life unless Thy mercy and grace  strengthen me?  Turn not away Thy face from me, delay not Thy  visitation.  Withdraw not Thou Thy comfort from me, lest my soul  \"gasp after thee as a thirsty land.\"  Lord, teach me to do Thy  will, teach me to walk humbly and uprightly before Thee, for Thou  art my wisdom, who knowest me in truth, and knewest me before the  world was made and before I was born into the world.    (1) John vi. 63.   (2) Psalm xciv. 13.   (3) Isaiah xxiii. 4.      CHAPTER IV    How we must walk in truth and humility before God    \"My Son! walk before Me in truth, and in the simplicity of thy  heart seek Me continually.  He who walketh before Me in the truth  shall be safe from evil assaults, and the truth shall deliver him  from the wiles and slanders of the wicked.  If the truth shall  make thee free, thou shalt be free indeed, and shalt not care for  the vain words of men.\"    2. Lord, it is true as Thou sayest; let it, I pray Thee, be so  with me; let Thy truth teach me, let it keep me and preserve me  safe unto the end.  Let it free me from all evil and inordinate  affection, and I will walk before Thee in great freedom of heart.    3. \"I will teach thee,\" saith the Truth, \"the things which are  right and pleasing before Me.  Think upon thy sins with great  displeasure and sorrow, and never think thyself anything because  of thy good works.  Verily thou art a sinner, liable to many  passions, yea, tied and bound with them.  Of thyself thou always  tendest unto nothing, thou wilt quickly fall, quickly be  conquered, quickly disturbed, quickly undone.  Thou hast nought  whereof to glory, but many reasons why thou shouldest reckon  thyself vile, for thou art far weaker than thou art able to  comprehend.    4. \"Let, therefore, nothing which thou doest seem to thee great;  let nothing be grand, nothing of value or beauty, nothing worthy  of honour, nothing lofty, nothing praiseworthy or desirable,  save what is eternal.  Let the eternal truth please thee above  all things, let thine own great vileness displease thee  continually.  Fear, denounce, flee nothing so much as thine own  faults and sins, which ought to be more displeasing to thee than  any loss whatsoever of goods.  There are some who walk not  sincerely before me, but being led by curiosity and pride, they  desire to know my secret things and to understand the deep things  of God, whilst they neglect themselves and their salvation.  These often fall into great temptations and sins because of their  pride and curiosity, for I am against them.    5. \"Fear thou the judgments of God, fear greatly the wrath of the  Almighty.  Shrink from debating upon the works of the Most High,  but search narrowly thine own iniquities into what great sins  thou hast fallen, and how many good things thou hast neglected.  There are some who carry their devotion only in books, some in  pictures, some in outward signs and figures; some have Me in  their mouths, but little in their hearts.  Others there are who,  being enlightened in their understanding and purged in their  affections, continually long after eternal things, hear of  earthly things with unwillingness, obey the necessities of nature  with sorrow.  And these understand what the Spirit of truth  speaketh in them; for He teacheth them to despise earthly things  and to love heavenly; to neglect the world and to desire heaven  all the day and night.\"      CHAPTER V    Of the wonderful power of the Divine Love    I bless Thee, O Heavenly Father, Father of my Lord Jesus Christ,  for that Thou hast vouchsafed to think of me, poor that I am.  O,  Father of Mercies and God of all comfort,(1) I give thanks unto  Thee, who refreshest me sometimes with thine own comfort, when I  am unworthy of any comfort.  I bless and glorify Thee  continually, with thine only begotten Son and the Holy Ghost, the  Paraclete, for ever and ever.  O Lord God, Holy lover of my soul,  when Thou shalt come into my heart, all my inward parts shall  rejoice.  Thou art my glory and the joy of my heart.  Thou art my  hope and my refuge in the day of my trouble.    2. But because I am still weak in love and imperfect in virtue, I  need to be strengthened and comforted by Thee; therefore visit  Thou me often and instruct me with Thy holy ways of discipline.  Deliver me from evil passions, and cleanse my heart from all  inordinate affections, that, being healed and altogether cleansed  within, I may be made ready to love, strong to suffer, steadfast  to endure.    3. Love is a great thing, a good above all others, which alone  maketh every heavy burden light, and equaliseth every inequality.  For it beareth the burden and maketh it no burden, it maketh  every bitter thing to be sweet and of good taste.  The surpassing  love of Jesus impelleth to great works, and exciteth to the  continual desiring of greater perfection.  Love willeth to be  raised up, and not to be held down by any mean thing.  Love  willeth to be free and aloof from all worldly affection, lest its  inward power of vision be hindered, lest it be entangled by any  worldly prosperity or overcome by adversity.  Nothing is sweeter  than love, nothing stronger, nothing loftier, nothing broader,  nothing pleasanter, nothing fuller or better in heaven nor on  earth, for love was born of God and cannot rest save in God above  all created things.    4. He who loveth flyeth, runneth, and is glad; he is free and not  hindered.  He giveth all things for all things, and hath all  things in all things, because he resteth in One who is high above  all, from whom every good floweth and proceedeth.  He looketh not  for gifts, but turneth himself to the Giver above all good  things.  Love oftentimes knoweth no measure, but breaketh out  above all measure; love feeleth no burden, reckoneth not labours,  striveth after more than it is able to do, pleadeth not  impossibility, because it judgeth all things which are lawful for  it to be possible.  It is strong therefore for all things, and it  fulfilleth many things, and is successful where he who loveth not  faileth and lieth down.    5. Love is watchful, and whilst sleeping still keepeth watch;  though fatigued it is not weary, though pressed it is not forced,  though alarmed it is not terrified, but like the living flame and  the burning torch, it breaketh forth on high and securely  triumpheth.  If a man loveth, he knoweth what this voice crieth.  For the ardent affection of the soul is a great clamour in the  ears of God, and it saith: My God, my Beloved!  Thou art all  mine, and I am all Thine.    6. Enlarge Thou me in love, that I may learn to taste with the  innermost mouth of my heart how sweet it is to love, to be  dissolved, and to swim in love.  Let me be holden by love,  mounting above myself through exceeding fervour and admiration.  Let me sing the song of love, let me follow Thee my Beloved on  high, let my soul exhaust itself in Thy praise, exulting with  love.  Let me love Thee more than myself, not loving myself  except for Thy sake, and all men in Thee who truly love Thee, as  the law of love commandeth which shineth forth from Thee.    7. Love is swift, sincere, pious, pleasant, gentle, strong,  patient, faithful, prudent, long-suffering, manly, and never  seeking her own; for wheresoever a man seeketh his own, there he  falleth from love.  Love is circumspect, humble, and upright; not  weak, not fickle, nor intent on vain things; sober, chaste,  steadfast, quiet, and guarded in all the senses.  Love is subject  and obedient to all that are in authority, vile and lowly in its  own sight, devout and grateful towards God, faithful and always  trusting in Him even when God hideth His face, for without  sorrow we cannot live in love."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16531"],[0,"Old St. Paul's Cathedral (#13)"],[1,"se, and warrants for 1000 loads of timber from her woods. L7000  were raised at once by the clergy and laymen of London, \"very frankly,  lovingly, and willingly,\" says the Guildhall record. Before a month  had elapsed a temporary roof was made, and in five years the lead roof  was complete.    The victory over the Armada, in 1588, sent all England wild with  delight. The Queen came in State to offer thanks at St. Paul's,  attended by all the nobility, and after the sermon dined with the  Bishop in his palace.    But the signs of irreverence and neglect are continually before us.  We have already given extracts from sermons denouncing it. It was  now that the raising of money by Government lotteries began, for the  purpose of repairing the harbours, and a great shed was set up at the  west door of St. Paul's for the drawing (1569). In 1605, four of the  Gunpowder conspirators were hanged in front of the west door, and in  the following May, Garnet, the Jesuit priest, shared the same fate on  the same spot.    Let us before closing this chapter take note of the monuments of four  Deans not mentioned in our last survey. They are Thomas Wynterbourne  (Dean 1471-1478), William Worsley (1479-1499), a fine brass. William  May we have already spoken of, Dean under Edward VI., deprived by  Mary, restored by Elizabeth, elected Archbishop of York, but died  the same day, August 8th, 1560. There were twelve Latin lines on his  grave. His successor, Alexander Nowell, who died in 1601 at the age of  ninety, was a zealous promoter of the Reformation. There was a fine  monument to him, a bust in fur robe, and very long Latin inscriptions  in prose and verse.    Before coming to the last chapter in the history of the great  cathedral, a chapter of decay, of zealous attempts at restoration, of  profanation, of one more attempt to restore, and of total destruction,  it becomes necessary to take one more retrospect.    [Footnote 1: The Grey Friars Monastery was on the site of Christ's  Hospital, this year removed. The Chronicler was one of the expelled  monks, and, naturally enough, was shocked at the whole business.]    [Footnote 2: Robert Machyn was an upholsterer of Queenhithe, whose  business, however, was chiefly in the way of funerals. He kept a  diary, which is much used by Strype in his _Annals_, but has been  reprinted in full by the Camden Society. It is very amusing, very  illiterate, and full of gossip. He was a hot partisan of the Roman  faith, and so never loses the opportunity of a fling at the Reformers.  He died of the plague in 1563.]    [Footnote 3: Milman's _Annals of St. Paul's_, pp. 280-1.]           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER VI.    THE CLERGY AND THE SERVICES.        _St. Paul's a Cathedral of the_ \"_Old Foundation_\"--_The Dean_      --_The Canons_--_The Prebends_--_Residentiaries_--_Treasurer_      --_Chancellor_--_Archdeacons_--_Minor Canons_--_Chantries_      --_Obits_--_Music in Old St. Paul's_--_Tallis_--_Redford_--_Byrd_      --_Morley_--_Dramatic Performances_--_The Boy Bishop_--_The Gift      of the Buck and Doe._      We have recorded the building of the Cathedral and some of the  principal national events of which it was the scene. But it is also  necessary, if our conception of its history is to aim at completeness,  to consider the character of its services, of its officers, of its  everyday life.    We speak of St. Paul's as \"a Cathedral of the Old Foundation,\" and  of Canterbury and Winchester as of \"the New Foundation.\" What is  the difference? The two last named, along with seven others, had  monasteries attached to them. Of such monasteries the Bishop was the  Abbot, and the cathedral was immediately ruled by his subordinate, who  was the Prior. Other monasteries also had Priors, namely, those which  were attached to greater ones. Thus the \"Alien\" houses belonged to  great monasteries at a distance, some of them even across the sea, in  Normandy. These houses became very unpopular, as being colonies of  foreigners whose interests were not those of England, and they were  abolished in the reign of Henry V. When Henry VIII. went further  and dissolved the monasteries altogether, it became needful to  reconstitute those cathedrals which were administered by monks. St.  Paul's not being such, remained on the old foundation; Winchester, of  which the Bishop was Abbot of the Monastery of St. Swithun, was placed  under a Dean and Canons, as was the great Monastery of Christchurch,  Canterbury. The last Prior of Winchester became the first Dean. It is  clear, therefore, that the Dean of Winchester stands on a somewhat  different historical footing from the Dean of St. Paul's, and it  becomes necessary to say something about the latter.    The word Dean belongs to the ancient Roman law, _Decanus_, lit. one  who has authority over ten, as a centurion was one who had authority  over a hundred. The Deans seem originally to have been especially  concerned with the management of funerals. Presently the name became  adopted to Christian use, and was applied in monasteries to those who  had charge of the discipline of every ten monks. When the Abbot was  absent the senior Dean undertook the government; and thus it was that  in cathedral churches which were monastic it gradually became the  custom to have one who acted as Dean, and this system was gradually  adopted in secular cathedrals, like St. Paul's. In monasteries,  however, the Dean was so far subordinate to the Prior that he had  charge of the music and ritual, while the Prior had a general  superintendence.    The clergy of St. Paul's then were seculars. There were thirty of  them, called Canons, as being entered on the list ([Greek: kanon]) of  ecclesiastics serving the church. Each man was entitled to a portion  of the income of the cathedral, and therefore was a \"Prebendary,\" the  name being derived from the daily rations (praebenda) served out to  soldiers. There were thirty Canons or Prebendaries attached to St.  Paul's, and these with the Bishop and Dean formed the Great Chapter.  To them in theory belonged the right of electing the Bishop; but it  was only theory, as it is still. The real nominator was the Pope or  the King, whichever happened at the crisis to be in the ascendant.    In early days the Bishop was the ruling power inside the cathedral. At  its first foundation, as we have seen, it was the Bishops who exerted  themselves to raise the money for the building. But as time went on  the Bishops, finding their hands full of affairs of state, stood aside  in great measure, retired to their pleasant home at Fulham, and left  to the Dean greater power. And thus it was that, as we have already  told, Dean Ralph de Diceto built the Deanery. And thus gradually the  Dean became practical ruler of the cathedral--the Bishop had no voice  in affairs of the Chapter, except on appeal. And it is a curious fact  that the Canons attempted to exclude the Dean from the managing body,  as having no Prebend. He could expel from the choir, and punish the  contumacious, but they contended that he had no power to touch the  revenues. It was because of this that Bishop Sudbury (1370), in order  to prevent the scandal of the Dean being excluded when the Chapter  were discussing business, attached a prebendal stall to the Deanery,  and thereby enabled him to preside, without possibility of cavil, at  all meetings of the Chapter.    As the Canons, or at any rate many of them, had other churches, they  had each his deputy, who said the service in the Cathedral. Each  Prebendary had his own manor, and there were other manors which  belonged to the common stock, and supplied the means of carrying on  the services and paying the humbler officials. The Canons, it will be  remembered, were secular, not monks; but they had a common \"College,\"  with a refectory, kitchen, brewhouse, bakehouse, and mill. Archdeacon  Hale computed that the manors comprised in all about 24,000 acres,  three-eighths of which were managed by the cathedral body, and the  rest let to tenants, who had protecting rights of their own. In  addition to these were the estates attached to the Deanery.    But with the changes which Time is always bringing, it came to pass  that some of the Canons, who held other benefices (and the number  increased as the years went on), preferred to live on their prebendal  manors, or in their parishes; to follow, in short, the Bishop's  example of non-attendance at the cathedral. And thus the services  devolved on a few men who stayed on and were styled Residentiaries.  These clerics not only had their keep at the common College, which  increased in comfort and luxury, but also came in for large incomes  from oblations, obits, and other privileges. At first it seemed  irksome to be tied down to residence, but as time went on this became  a privilege eagerly sought after; and thus grew up, what continues  still, a chapter within the chapter, and the management of the  cathedral fell into the hands of the Residentiaries.    [Illustration: A PONTIFICAL MASS. 'Ad te levavi animam meam.' _From a  Missal of the Fifteenth Century. British Museum_, 19897.]    The Treasurer was a canon of very great importance; the tithes of four  churches came to him. He was entrusted with the duty of providing the  lighting of the cathedral, and had charge of the relics, the books,  the sacred vessels, crosses, curtains, and palls. The Sacrist had  to superintend the tolling of the bells, to see that the church was  opened at the appointed times, that it was kept clean, and that  reverence was maintained at times of service. Under him were four  Vergers (wand-bearers), who enforced the Sacrist's rules, and took  care that bad characters were not harboured in the church, and that  burden-bearers were kept out. We have seen that these duties fell  largely into abeyance at certain times. Every Michaelmas Day the  Verger appeared before the Dean to give up his wand,"]]]
