He exhibited undoubted  symptoms of delirium tremens. Cider was the common beverage of the family.  Dr. Travis has been called to several other cases of delirium tremens from  the use of cider.--_Mrs. E.J. Richmond._    A CAUTION TO MOTHERS.--One of the first literary men in the United States  said to a temperance lecturer: \"There is one thing which I wish you to do  everywhere; entreat every mother never to give a drop of strong drink to a  child. I have had to fight as for my life all my days to keep from dying a  drunkard, because I was fed with spirits when a child. I thus acquired an  appetite for it. My brother, poor fellow, died a drunkard.\"    A GIRL DRUNKARD.--A young girl of eighteen, beautiful, intelligent, and  temperate, the pride of her home, was recommended to take a little gin for  some chronic ailment. She took it; it soothed the pain; she kept on taking  it; it created an artificial appetite, and in four years she died a  drunkard.--_Medical Temperance Journal._    \"A LITTLE WON'T HURT HIM.\"--I was the pet of the family. Before I could  well walk I was treated to the sweet from the bottom of my father's glass.  My dear mother would gently chide with him, \"Don't, John, it will do him  harm.\" To this he would smilingly reply, \"This little sup won't hurt him.\"  When I became a school-boy I was ill at times, and my mother would pour for  me a glass of wine from the decanter. At first I did not like it; but, as I  was told that it would make me strong, I got to like it. When I became an  apprentice, I reasoned thus: \"My parents told me that these drinks are  good, and I cannot get them except at the public-house.\" Step by step I  fell.... I have grown to manhood, but my course of intemperance has added  sin to sin. My days are now nearly ended. Hope for the future I have  none.--_Dying Drunkard._    DANGER.--In one of Mr. Moody's temperance prayer meetings at Chicago, a  reformed man attributed a former relapse of drunkenness wholly to a  physician's prescription to take whiskey three times a day!    KILLED BY THE POISON.--Many years ago, when stage coaches were in use in  England, during a very cold night, a young woman mounted the coach. A  respectable tradesman sitting there asked her what induced her to travel on  such a night, when she replied that she was going to the bedside of her  mother, of whose illness she had just heard. She was soon wrapped in such  coats, etc., as the passengers could spare, and when they stopped the  tradesman procured her some brandy. She declined it at first, saying she  had never drank spirits in her life. But he said, \"Drink it down; it won't  hurt you on such a bitter night.\" This was done repeatedly, until the poor  girl fell fast asleep, and when they arrived in London she could not be  roused. She was stiff and cold in death, and the doctor, on the coroner's  inquest, said that she had been killed by the brandy.--_Mrs. Balfour._    IN CASE OF SHIPWRECK.--In the winter of 1796 a vessel was wrecked on an  island of the Massachusetts coast, and five persons on board determined to  swim ashore. Four of them drank freely of spirits to keep up their  strength, but the fifth would drink none. One was drowned, and all that  drank spirits failed and stopped, and froze one after another, the man that  drank none being the only one that reached the house at some distance from,  the shore, and he lived many years after that.    IT EXHAUSTS STRENGTH.--Concerning one cold winter when there were very  severe snow-storms in the Highlands of Scotland, James Hogg, the poet,  says: \"It was a received opinion all over the country that sundry lives  were lost, and a great many more endangered, by the administration of  ardent spirits to the sufferers _while in a state of exhaustion_. A little  bread and sweet milk, or even bread and cold water, proved a much safer  restorative in the fields. Some who took a glass of spirits that night  never spoke another word, even though they were continuing to walk and  converse when their friends joined them. One woman found her husband lying  in a state of insensibility; she had only sweet milk and oatmeal cake to  give him, but with these she succeeded in getting him home and saving  him.\"--_Bacchus._    SHIPMASTER OF THE KEDRON.--\"I was brought up in a temperance school, and  when I shipped before the mast I stuck to my principles, though everyone  else on board drank excepting two boys whom I persuaded to abstain. In a  very severe storm off a lee-shore, when it was so cold they had to break  the icicles off the ropes to tack the ship, all drank but myself and these  two boys. The men would work very well for a few minutes, and then slack  off and take another drink, until they were all keeled up, and we three  boys had all we could do to keep the ship from going ashore. If we had  drank with the rest, all would have been lost, for the men were too drunk  to save themselves. Providentially, the storm abated before morning, and we  were saved. Now, for many years I have been captain of my own ship, and I  never give out one drop of liquor.\"--_Captain Brown._    ON THE PLAINS.--Twenty-six men, travelling on one of the great Western  plains in the United States, were overtaken by cold and night. They had  food, clothing, and whiskey, but no fire. They were warned not to drink  whiskey or they would freeze. Three did not drink a drop, and though they  felt cold they did not suffer nor freeze. Three more drank a little, and  though they suffered much they did not freeze. Seven others that drank a  good deal had their toes and fingers frozen. Six that drank pretty strong  were badly frozen and never got over it. Four that got very boozy were  frozen so badly that they died three or four weeks afterward. Three that  got dead drunk were stiff dead by daylight. They all suffered just in  proportion to the amount of whiskey they took. They were all strong men,  and had about the same amount of clothing and blankets; the whiskey was all  that made the difference.    THE RED RIVER EXPEDITION in Canada, in 1870, is often quoted as one of the  most laborious on record, 1200 troops travelling 1200 miles through a very  dense wilderness, and having all their supplies to carry. They were  ninety-four days out, and none of them had liquor. They were constantly wet  through, sometimes for days together, and all the while at the severe labor  of rowing, poling, tracking, and portaging, yet they were always well and  cheery, and there was a total absence of crime.    IN AFRICA it is far safer to do without intoxicating drink. Livingstone  says that he lived without it for twenty years. Stanley performed his  wonderful journey without it. Bruce said more than one hundred, years ago:  \"I laid down as a positive rule of health that spirits and all fermented  liquors should be regarded as poisonous. Spring, or running water, if you  can find it, is to be your only drink.\"    WATERTON, the great naturalist, who travelled so much in South America,  says: \"I eat moderately, and never drink wine, spirits, or any fermented  liquors in any climate. This abstemiousness has proved a faithful friend.\"  He died by accident at the age of eighty-three.    MR. HUBER, who saw 2160 perish of cholera in twenty-five days in one town  in Russia, says that \"Persons given to drinking are swept away like flies.  In Tiflis, containing 20,000 inhabitants, every drunkard has fallen.\" Of  204 cases of cholera in the Park Hospital, New York, there were but six  temperate persons, and these recovered. In Albany, where cholera prevailed  with severe mortality for several weeks, only two of the 5000 members of  temperance societies became its victims. In Montreal, where the victims of  the disease were intemperate, it usually cut them off. In Great Britain,  those who have been addicted to spirituous liquors and irregular habits  have been the greatest sufferers from cholera. In some towns the drunkards  are all dead.--_Bacchus._    MALT LIQUORS, under which title are included all kinds of porters and ales,  produce the worst species of drunkenness. The effects of malt liquors are  more stupefying than those of ardent spirits, and less easily removed. In a  short time they render dull and sluggish the gayest disposition.--_Anatomy  of Drunkenness._    GINGER-BEER.--A man who has been a temperance-worker for forty-five years,  says that there is often alcohol in ginger-beer. He told of a case known to  him of a reformed man who, after drinking some, felt strongly drawn to the  bar-room, where he drank until he brought on delirium tremens. The beer  will sometimes ferment enough in a few hours to produce alcohol--if it  answers the conditions--a sweet liquid and a ferment.    DANGER TO THE REFORMED.--A lady who had become a drunkard through taking  alcoholic drinks as medicines, at length, after many efforts, succeeded in  breaking away from the power of the appetite, and for a long time she  seemed to be saved. At length she went to visit her mother, and that mother  put brandy peaches on the table for tea. They aroused the slumbering  appetite, the victim fell again, became worse than ever, and died a  miserable drunkard.

THE RIGHT SIDE.--\"Boys, which is the right side of the public house? Can  you tell me?\"--\"Yes, sir, the outside.\"    THE GOAT AND THE ALE.--Many years ago, when everybody drank freely, a Welsh  minister named Rees Pritchard was at the ale-house drinking, when he took  it into his head to offer some ale to a large tame goat. The animal drank  till he fell down drunk, and the minister drank on till he was carried home  drunk. The next day he was sick all day, but on the third day he went again  to the ale-house, and began to drink. The goat was there, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15446"],[0,"Vocal Mastery (#13)"],[1,"last thing the student should yield to--discouragement, for  this has stunted or impaired the growth of many singers possessed of  natural talent. The young singer must never be down-hearted. Suppose  things do not go as she would like to have them; she must learn to  overcome obstacles, not be overcome by them. She must have backbone  enough to stand up under disappointments; they are the test of her  mettle, of her worthiness to enter the circle with those who have  overcome. For she can be sure that none of us have risen to a place in  art without the hardest kind of work, struggle and the conquering of all  sorts of difficulties.    \"The sixth asset ought to be Patience, for she will need that in large  measure. It is only with patient striving, doing the daily vocal task,  and trying to do it each day a little better than the day before, that  anything worth while is accomplished. It is a work that cannot be  hurried. I repeat it; the student must have unlimited patience to labor  and wait for results.      COLORATURA AND DRAMATIC    \"I would advise every student to study coloratura first. Then, as the  voice broadens, deepens and takes on a richer timbre, it will turn  naturally to the more dramatic expression. The voice needs this  background, or foundation in the old Italian music, in order to acquire  flexibility and freedom. I was not trained to follow this plan myself,  but my daughter Louise, who is just starting out in her public career,  has been brought up to this idea, which seems to me the best.      MEMORIZING    \"I memorize very easily, learning both words and music at the same time.  In taking up a new role, my accompanist plays it for me and we go over  it carefully noting all there is in language and notes. When I can take  it to bed with me, and go over it mentally; when I can go through it as  I walk along the street, then it has become a part of me; then I can  feel I know it.\"    \"Mme. Homer holds the banner at the Metropolitan, for rapid memorizing,\"  said her husband. \"On one occasion, when _Das Rheingold_ was announced  for an evening performance, the Fricka was suddenly indisposed and  unable to appear. Early in the afternoon, the Director came to Mme.  Homer, begging her to do the part, as otherwise he would be forced to  close the house that night. A singer had tried all forenoon to learn the  role, but had now given it up as impossible. Mme. Homer consented. She  started in at three o'clock and worked till six, went on in the evening,  sang the part without rehearsal, and acquitted herself with credit. This  record has never been surpassed at the Metropolitan.\" \"I knew the other  Frickas of the Ring,\" said Madame, \"but had never learned the one in the  _Rheingold_; it is full of short phrases and difficult to remember, but  I came through all right. I may add, as you ask, that perhaps _Orfeo_ is  my favorite role, one of the most beautiful works we have.\"      VOCAL MASTERY    \"What do I understand by Vocal Mastery? The words explain themselves.  The singer must master all difficulties of technic, of tone production,  so as to be able to express the thought of the composer, and the meaning  of the music.\"    \"Don't forget that the singer must have a musical nature,\" added Mr.  Homer, \"for without this true vocal mastery is impossible.\"          XI    =GIOVANNI MARTINELLI=    \"LET US HAVE PLENTY OF OPERA IN AMERICA\"      Said the Professor: \"How well I remember the first time I heard  Martinelli. We were traveling in Italy that summer, and had arrived in  Verona rather late in the afternoon. The city seemed full of people,  with many strangers, and we could not at first secure accommodations at  the hotel. Inquiring the cause, the answer was: 'Does not the signer  know that to-day is one holiday, and to-night, in the Amphitheater,  _Aida_ will be sung, under the stars.' We finally secured rooms, and of  course heard the opera that night. Young Martinelli was the Rhadames,  and I shall never forget how splendidly his voice rang out over those  vast spaces of the Arena. It was a most unusual experience to hear that  music sung in the open--'under the stars,' and it was unforgettable.\"    [Illustration: GIOVANNI MARTINELLI]    Giovanni Martinelli, who has been for several years one of the leading  tenors at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, has warmly entrenched  himself in the hearts of music lovers in America. To be a great singer,  as some one has said, requires, first, voice; second, voice; third,  voice. However, at the present hour a great singer must have more than  voice; we demand histrionic ability also. We want singing actors as well  as great singers.    Mr. Martinelli is the possessor of a beautiful voice and, moreover, is a  fine actor and an excellent musician. He was, first of all, a  clarinetist before he became a singer, and so well did he play his  chosen instrument that his services were in great demand in his home  town in Italy. Then it was discovered he had a voice and he was told he  could make a far greater success with that voice than he ever could  playing the clarinet. He set to work at once to cultivate the voice in  serious earnest and under good instruction. After a considerable time  devoted to study, he made his debut in Milan, in Verdi's _Ernani_. His  success won an engagement at Covent Garden and for Monte Carlo.    A visit to the singer's New York home is a most interesting experience.  He has chosen apartments perched high above the great artery of the  city's life--Broadway. From the many sun-flooded windows magnificent  views of avenue, river and sky are visible, while at night the  electrical glamour that meets the eye is fairy-like. It is a sightly  spot and must remind the singer of his own sun lighted atmosphere at  home.    The visitor was welcomed with simple courtesy by a kindly, unaffected  gentleman, who insists he cannot speak \"your English,\" but who, in spite  of this assertion, succeeds in making himself excellently well  understood. One feels his is a mentality that will labor for an object  and will attain it through force of effort. There is determination in  the firm mouth, which smiles so pleasantly when speaking; the thoughtful  brow and serious eyes add their share to the forceful personality. The  Titian-tinted hair indicates, it is said, a birthplace in northern  Italy. This is quite true in the case of Mr. Martinelli, as he comes  from a village not far from Padua and but fifty miles from Venice--the  little town of Montagnana.      DAILY STUDY    \"You ask about my daily routine of study. In the morning I practice  exercises and vocalizes for one hour. These put the voice in good  condition, tune up the vocal chords and oil up the mechanism, so to  speak. After this I work on repertoire for another hour. I always  practice with full voice, as with half voice I would not derive the  benefit I need. At rehearsals I use half voice, but not when I study. In  the afternoon I work another hour, this time with my accompanist; for I  do not play the piano myself, only just enough to assist the voice with  a few chords. This regime gives me three hours' regular study, which  seems to me quite sufficient. The voice is not like the fingers of a  pianist, for they can be used without limit. If we would keep the voice  at its best, we must take care not to overwork it.      TREATMENT OF THE VOICE    \"In regard to the treatment of the voice, each singer must work out his  own salvation. A great teacher--one who understands his own voice and  can sing as well as teach--may tell how he does things, may explain how  he treats the voice, may demonstrate to the student his manner of  executing a certain phrase or passage, or of interpreting a song. But  when this is done he can do little more for the student, for each person  has a different mentality and a different quality of voice--indeed  there are as many qualities of voice as there are people. After general  principles are thoroughly understood, a singer must work them out  according to his own ability. This does not mean that he cannot be  guided and helped by the greater experience of a master higher up, who  can always criticize the _result_ of what the student is trying to do.  The voice is a hidden instrument, and eventually its fate must rest with  its possessor.      A NEW ROLE    \"When I take up a new part I read the book very carefully to get a  thorough idea of the story, the plot and the characters. Then comes the  study of my own part, of which I memorize the words first of all. As  soon as the words are committed I begin on the music. When these are  both well in hand, work with the accompanist follows.    \"I have many tenor roles in my repertoire and am working on others. If  you ask for my favorite opera, or operas, I would answer, as most  Italians would do, that I enjoy singing the music of Verdi more than  that of any composer. I love his _Aida_ perhaps best of all. _Ernani_ is  a beautiful opera, but maybe would be thought too old-fashioned for New  York. I sing various roles in French as well as Italian--_Faust, Sans  Gene_, and many more. In Italy we know Wagner very well--_Lohengrin,  Tannhauser, Tristan_ and _Meistersinger_,--but of course they are always  sung in Italian.      OPERA IN EVERY CITY    \"The Metropolitan is one of the greatest opera houses in the world--but  it is only _one_. You have a wonderful country, yet most of its cities  must do without opera. Do not forget that in Italy every city and town  has its opera house and its season of opera, lasting ten weeks or more.  Of course the works are not elaborately produced, the singers may not be  so great or high-salaried, but the people are being educated to know and  love the best opera music. Performances are given Wednesdays and  Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays; the singers resting the days between.  They need to as they are obliged to sing at every performance.    \"Ah, if you would"]]]
