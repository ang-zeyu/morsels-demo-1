Frankness and manliness are hardly to be looked  for under a despotic government where men are forbidden to speak their  minds openly; and the Alexandrians made use of such checks upon their  rulers as the law allowed them. They lived under an absolute monarchy  tempered only by ridicule. Though their city was four hundred years old,  they were still colonists and without a mother-country. They had very  little faith in anything great or good, whether human or divine. They  had few cherished prejudices, no honoured traditions, sadly little love  of fame, and they wrote no histories. But in luxury and delicacy they  set the fashion to their conquerors. The wealthy Alexandrian walked  about Rome in a scarlet robe, in summer fanning himself with gold, and  displaying on his fingers rings carefully suited to the season; as his  hands were too delicate to carry his heavier jewels in the warm weather.  At the supper tables of the rich, the Alexandrian singing boys were  much valued; the smart young Roman walked along the Via Sacra humming  an Alexandrian tune; the favourite comic actor, the delight of the  city, whose jokes set the theatre in a roar, was an Alexandrian; the  Retiarius, who, with no weapon but a net, fought against an armed  gladiator in the Roman forum, and came off conqueror in twenty-six such  battles, was an Alexandrian; and no breed of fighting-cocks was thought  equal to those reared in the suburbs of Alexandria.    In the reign of Augustus the Roman generals had been defeated in their  attacks on Arabia; but under Trajan, when the Romans were masters of all  the countries which surround Arabia Nabataea, and when Egypt was so  far quiet that the legions could be withdrawn without danger to the  provinces, the Arabs could hold out no longer, and the rocky fastness  of Petra was forced to receive a Roman garrison. The event was as usual  commemorated on the coins of Rome; and for the next four hundred years  that remarkable Arab city formed part of the Roman empire; and Europeans  now travelling through the desert from Mount Sinai to Jerusalem are  agreeably surprised at coming upon temples, carved out of the solid  rock, ornamented with Corinthian columns of the age of the Antonines.    In the twelfth year of this reign, when Lucius Sulpicius Simius was  prefect, some additions which had been made to the temple at Panopolis  in the Thebaid were dedicated in the name of the emperor; and in the  nineteenth year, when Marcus Rutilius Lupus was prefect, a new portico  in the oasis of Thebes was in the same manner dedicated to Serapis and  Isis. A small temple, which had been before built at Denderah, near the  great temple of Venus, was in the first year of this reign dedicated to  the Empress Plotina, under the name of the great goddess, the Younger  Venus.    The canal from the Nile near Bubastis to the Bitter Lakes, which had  been first made by Necho, had been either finished or a second time  made by Philadelphus; and in this reign that great undertaking was again  renewed. But the stream of the Nile was deserting the Bubastite branch,  which was less navigable than formerly; and the engineers now changed  the greater part of the canal's bed. They thought it wiser to bring  water from a higher part of the Nile, so that the current in the canal  might run into the Red Sea instead of out, and its waters might still  be fresh and useful to agriculture. It now began at Babylon opposite  Memphis and entered the Red Sea at a town which, taking its name from  the locks, was called Clysmon, about ten miles to the south of Arsinoe.  This latter town was no longer a port, having been separated from the  sea by the continual advance of the sands. We have no knowledge of how  long the care of the imperial prefects kept this new canal open and in  use. It was perhaps one of the first of the Roman works that went to  decay; and, when we find the Christian pilgrims sailing along it seven  centuries later, on their way from England to the holy sepulchre, it had  been again opened by the Muhammedan conquerors of Egypt.    [Illustration: 089.jpg ANTONINIAN TEMPLE NEAR SINAI]    Writings which some now regard as literary forgeries appeared in  Alexandria about this time. They prophesied the re-establishment of  the Jews at Jerusalem, and, as the wished-for time drew near, all the  eastern provinces of the Roman empire were disturbed by rebellious  risings of the Jews. Moved by the religious enthusiasm which gave birth  to the writings, the Jews of Egypt in the eighteenth year of this  reign (116 A.D.) were again roused into a quarrel with their Greek  fellow-citizens; and in the next year, the last of the reign, they rose  against their Roman governors in open rebellion, and they were not put  down till the prefect Lupus had brought his forces against them. After  this the Jews of Cyrene marched through the desert into Egypt, under the  command of Lucuas, to help their brethren; and the rebellion took the  regular form of a civil war, with all its usual horrors. The emperor  sent against the Jews an army followed by a fleet, which, after numerous  skirmishes and battles, routed them with great slaughter, and drove  numbers of them back into the desert, whence they harassed the village  as robbers. By these unsuccessful appeals to force, the Jews lost all  right to those privileges of citizenship which they always claimed, and  which had been granted by the emperors, though usually refused by the  Alexandrians. The despair and disappointment of the Jews seem in many  cases to have turned their minds to the Christian view of the Old  Testament prophecies; henceforth, says Eusebius, the Jews embraced the  Christian religion more readily and in greater numbers.    In A.D. 122, the sixth year of the reign of Hadrian, Egypt was honoured  by a visit from the emperor. He was led to Egypt at that time by some  riots of a character more serious than usual, which had arisen between  two cities, probably Memphis and Heliopolis, about a bull, as to whether  it was to be Apis or Mnevis. Egypt had been for some years without a  sacred bull; and when at length the priests found one, marked with the  mystic spots, the inhabitants of those two cities flew to arms, and  the peace of the province was disturbed by their religious zeal, each  claiming the bull as their own.    Hadrian also undertook a voyage up the Nile from Alexandria in order to  explore the wonders of Egypt. This was the fashion then, for the ancient  monuments and the banks of this mysterious river offered just as many  attractions at that time as they have done to all nations since  the expedition of Napoleon. That animal-worship, which had remained  unchanged for centuries, a riddle of human religion, was bound to excite  the curiosity of strangers. In this divinisation of animals lay the  greatest contempt for human understanding, and it was a bitter satire  on the apotheosis of kings and emperors. For what was the divinity  of Sesostris, of Alexander, of Augustus, or Hadrian compared with  the heavenly majesty of the ox Apis, or the holy cats, dogs, kites,  crocodiles, and god-apes? Egypt was at this epoch already a museum of  the Pharaoh-time and its enbalamed culture. Strange buildings, rare  sculptures, hieroglyphics, and pictures still filled the ancient towns,  even though these had lost their splendour. Memphis and Heliopolis,  Bubastis, Abydos, Sais, Tanis, and the hundred-gated Thebes had long  fallen into ruin, although still inhabited.    The emperor's escort must have been an extraordinary sight as it steered  up the stream on a fleet of dahabiehs. The emperor was accompanied by  students of the museum, interpreters, priests, and astrologers. Amongst  his followers were Verus and the beautiful Antinous.    The Empress Sabina also accompanied him; she had the poetess Julia  Balbilla amongst her court ladies. They landed wherever there was  anything of interest to be seen, and there was more in those days than  there is now. They admired the great pyramids, the colossal sphinx, and  the sacred town of Memphis. This city, the ancient royal seat of the  Pharaohs, and even in Strabo's time the second town in Egypt, was not  yet buried under the sand of the desert; its disappearance had, however,  already begun. Under the Ptolemies it had given much of the material of  her temples and palaces for the building of Alexandria. The great palace  of the Pharaohs had long been destroyed, but there still remained  many notable monuments, such as the temple of Phtah, the pyramids, the  necropolis, and the Serapeum, and they retained their ancient cult.  The town was still the chief seat of the Egyptian hierarchy and the  residence of Apis; for this very reason the Roman government had  destined it to be one of her strong military stations, for here a legion  was quartered. The emperor could walk through the time-worn avenues of  sphinxes which led to the wonderful vaults where the long succession of  divine animals was buried, each like a Pharaoh, in a magnificent granite  sarcophagus. Hadrian could admire the beautifully sculptured tomb of Di,  an Egyptian officer of the fifth dynasty, with less trouble than we  must experience now; for now the palaces, the pictures of the gods,  and almost all the pyramids are swallowed up in sand. Miserable Arab  villages, such as Saqqara, have fixed themselves in the ruins of  Memphis, and from a thick palm grove one can look with astonishment  upon the torso of the powerful Ramses II. lying solitary there, the last  witness to the glory of the temple of Phtah, before which this colossus  once had its stand. In the neighbourhood of Memphis lay Heliopolis, the  town of the sun-god, with its ancient temple, and a school of Egyptian  wisdom, in which Plato is supposed to have studied.    In Heliopolis the worship of the god Ra was preserved, the centre of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17332"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 12 (of 12) (#13)"],[1," at Damanhour,  but they met with nothing there but miserable huts, and could procure  neither bread nor wine; only lentils in great abundance, and a little  water. They were obliged to proceed again into the desert. Bonaparte saw  the brave Lannes and Murat take off their hats, dash them on the sand,  and trample them under foot. He, however, overawed all: his presence  imposed silence, and sometimes restored cheerfulness. The soldiers would  not impute their sufferings to him, but grew angry with those who took  pleasure in observing the country. On seeing the men of science stop to  examine the slightest ruins, they said they should not have been there  but for them, and revenged themselves with witticisms after their  fashion. Caffarelli, in particular, brave as a grenadier, and  inquisitive as a scholar, was considered by them as the man who had  deceived the general and drawn him into this distant country. As he had  lost a leg on the Rhine, they said, \"He, for his part, laughs at this:  he has one foot in France.\" At last, after severe hardships, endured at  first with impatience, and afterwards with gaiety and fortitude, they  reached the Nile on the 10th of July, after a march of four days. At  the sight of the Nile and of the water so much longed for, the soldiers  flung themselves into it, and, bathing in its waves, forgot their  fatigues. Desaix' division, which from the advance-guard had become the  rear-guard, saw two or three hundred Mamluks galloping before it, whom  they dispersed by a few volleys of grape. These were the first that had  been seen, which warned the French that they would speedily fall in with  the hostile army. The brave Murad Bey, having received the intelligence  of the arrival of Bonaparte, was actually collecting his forces around  Cairo. Until they should have assembled, he was hovering with a thousand  horse about the army, in order to watch its march.    The army waited at Ramanieh for the arrival of the flotilla. It rested  till July 13th, and set out on the same day for Chebreiss. Murad Bey was  waiting there with his Mamluks. The flotilla, which had set out  first and preceded the army, found itself engaged before it could be  supported. Murad Bey had a flotilla also, and from the shore he joined  his fire to that of his light Egyptian vessels. The French flotilla had  to sustain a very severe combat. Perree, a naval officer who commanded  it, displayed extraordinary courage; he was supported by the cavalry,  who had come dismounted to Egypt, and who, until they could equip  themselves at the expense of the Mamluks, had taken their passage  by water. Two gunboats were retaken from the enemy, and Perree was  repulsed.    At that moment the army came up; it was composed of five divisions, and  had not yet been in action with its singular enemies. To swiftness and  the charge of horse, and to sabre-cuts, it would be necessary to  oppose the immobility of the foot-soldier, his long bayonet, and masses  presenting a front on every side. Bonaparte formed his five divisions  into five squares, in the centre of which were placed the baggage and  the staff. The artillery was at the angles. The five divisions flanked  one another. Murad Bey flung upon these living citadels a thousand or  twelve hundred intrepid horse; who, bearing down with loud shouts and  at full gallop, discharging their pistols, and then drawing their  formidable sabres, threw themselves upon the front of the squares.  Encountering everywhere a hedge of bayonets and a tremendous fire, they  hovered about the French ranks, Fell before them, or scampered off in  the plain at the utmost speed of their horses. Murad Bey, after losing  a few of his bravest men, retired for the purpose of proceeding to the  point of the Delta, and awaiting them near Cairo at the head of all his  forces.    This action was sufficient to familiarise the army with this new kind of  enemy, and to suggest to Bonaparte the kind of tactics which he ought to  employ with them. He pursued his march towards Cairo, and the flotilla  ascended the Nile abreast of the army. It marched without intermission  during the following days, and, although the soldiers had fresh  hardships to endure, they kept close to the Nile, and could bathe every  night in its waters.    The army now approached Cairo, where the decisive battle was to be  fought. Murad Bey had collected here the greater part of his Mamluks,  nearly ten thousand in number, and they were attended by double the  number of fellahs, to whom arms were given, and who were obliged to  fight behind the intrenchments. He had also assembled some thousands  of janizaries, or spahis, dependent on the pasha, who, notwithstanding  Bonaparte's letter of conciliation, had suffered himself to be persuaded  to join his oppressors. Murad Bey had made preparations for defence  on the banks of the Nile. The great capital, Cairo, is situated on the  right bank of the river, and on the opposite bank Murad Bey had pitched  his tent, in a long plain extending from the river to the pyramids of  Gizeh.    On the 21st of July, the French army set itself in motion before  daybreak. As they approached, they saw the minarets of Cairo shooting  up; they saw the pyramids increase in height; they saw the swarming  multitude which guarded Embabeh; they saw the glistening arms of ten  thousand horsemen resplendent with gold and steel, and forming an  immense line.    [Illustration: GATHERING DATES]    The face of Bonaparte beamed with enthusiasm. He began to gallop before  the ranks of the soldiers, and, pointing to the pyramids, he exclaimed,  \"Consider, that from the summit of those pyramids forty centuries have  their eyes fixed upon you.\"    In the battle of the Pyramids, as it was called, the enemy's force  of sixty thousand men was almost completely annihilated. The Mamluks,  bewildered by European tactics, impaled themselves upon the bayonets  of the French squares. Fifteen thousand men of all arms fell upon the  field. The battle had cost the French scarcely a hundred killed and  wounded; for, if defeat is terrible for broken squares, the loss is  insignificant for victorious squares. The Mamluks had lost their  best horsemen by fire or water: their forces were dispersed, and the  possession of Cairo secured. The capital was in extraordinary agitation.  It contained more than three hundred thousand inhabitants, many of whom  were indulging in all sorts of excesses, and intending to profit by the  tumult to pillage the rich palaces of the beys.    The French flotilla, however, had not yet ascended the Nile, and there  was no means of crossing to take possession of Cairo. Some French  traders who happened to be there were sent to Bonaparte by the sheikhs  to arrange concerning the occupation of the city. He procured a few  light boats, or djerms, and sent across the river a detachment of  troops, which at once restored tranquillity, and secured persons and  property from the fury of the populace.    Bonaparte established his headquarters at Gizeh, on the banks of the  Nile, where Murad Bey had an imposing residence. A considerable store  of provisions was found both at Gizeh and at Embabeh, and the soldiers  could make amends for their long privations. No sooner had he settled  in Cairo than he hastened to pursue the same policy which he had already  adopted at Alexandria, and by which he hoped to gain the country.  The essential point was to obtain from the sheikhs of the mosque of  Jemil-Azar a declaration in favour of the French. It corresponded to  a papal bull among Christians. On this occasion Bonaparte exerted his  utmost address, and was completely successful. The great sheikhs issued  the desired declaration, and exhorted the Egyptians to submit to the  envoy of God, who reverenced the Prophet, and who had come to deliver  his children from the tyranny of the Mamluks. Bonaparte established a  divan at Cairo, as he had done at Alexandria, composed of the principal  sheikhs, and the most distinguished inhabitants. This divan, or  municipal council, was intended to serve him in gaining the minds of the  Egyptians, by consulting it, and learning from it all the details of the  internal administration. It was agreed that similar assemblies should  be established in all the provinces, and that these subordinate divans  should send deputies to the divan of Cairo, which would thus be the  great national divan.    Bonaparte resolved to leave the administration of justice to the cadis.  In execution of his scheme of succeeding to the rights of the Mamluks,  he seized their property, and caused the taxes previously imposed to  continue to be levied for the benefit of the French army. For this  purpose it was requisite that he should have the Kopts at his disposal.  He omitted nothing to attach them to him, holding out hopes to them of  an amelioration of their condition. He sent generals with detachments  down the Nile to complete the occupation of the Delta, which the army  had merely traversed, and sent others towards the Upper Nile, to take  possession of Middle Egypt. Desaix was placed with a division at the  entrance of Upper Egypt, which he was to conquer from Murad Bey, as  soon as the waters of the Nile should subside in the autumn. Each of  the generals, furnished with detailed instructions, was to repeat in  the country what had been done at Alexandria and at Cairo. They were to  court the sheikhs, to win the Kopts, and to establish the levy of the  taxes in order to supply the wants of the army. Bonaparte was also  attentive to keep up the relations with the neighbouring countries,  in order to uphold and to appropriate to himself the rich commerce of  Egypt. He appointed the Emir Hadgi, an officer annually chosen at Cairo,  to protect the great caravan from Mecca. He wrote to all the French  consuls on the coast of Barbary to inform the beys that the Emir Hadgi  was appointed, and that the caravans"]]]
