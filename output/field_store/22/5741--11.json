[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19252"],[0,"Bahá'í Administration (#13)"],[1,"contributed to the Journal by Mr. Horace  Holley and Mr. Stanwood Cobb, and would indeed welcome with genuine  satisfaction an even more active participation on their part in the  editorial section of the Baha'i Magazine.    I have addressed a few days ago a cable to the secretary of the National  Spiritual Assembly, requesting the friends to exercise restraint and  caution in the use and distribution of the record of the Master's voice.  In my view, it should be used only on special occasions and be listened to  with the utmost reverence. The dignity of the Cause, I am sure, would  suffer from too wide and indiscriminate use of one of the most precious  relics of our departed Master.    Regarding the short film of the Master, for which, as well as for the  record of His voice, I am deeply indebted to the selfless efforts and  services of my dear brother, Mr. Roy C. Wilhelm, it would be undoubtedly  better to combine it with other films representing various scenes in the  history of the Cause, taken in countries visited by the Bab and  Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha. As this would take considerable time and  preparation and would entail much expense I wonder whether it would be an  expense and burden to you to forward only to the Holy Land one copy of the  actual film, as it would impart untold happiness and consolation to the  bereaved ladies of the Holy Household.    I am gratified to peruse the able and masterly work of my dear  fellow-worker, Mr. Horace Holley, a work(10) which I have no doubt will by  virtue of its subject matter, its comprehensiveness and uniqueness arouse  widespread and genuine interest in the Movement. I am looking forward  eagerly to similar productions by the pen of such able and gifted servants  of Baha'u'llah.    I am enclosing for all the friends recent translations of those highly  significant utterances of Baha'u'llah, revealed some fifty years ago, and  pregnant with His divine wisdom. His ringing call to humanity in its hour  of peril sounds prophetic in these days of utter gloom.    I am forwarding also a copy of the transliterated Oriental terms with few  corrections of minor type errors. I am confident that the friends will not  feel their energy and patience taxed by a scrupulous adherence to what is  an authoritative and universal, though arbitrary code for the spelling of  Oriental terms.          Committees of the National Assembly      The diligent efforts exerted by the various committees of the National  Spiritual Assembly, those for National Teaching, for the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, the Star of the West, the National Library, for the  reviewing and publication of Baha'i literature, for education, for the  National Archives and the Race Amity Conventions, have cheered and  heartened me in the discharge of my manifold duties, and constitute in  themselves a convincing evidence and inspiring example to the Baha'i world  of the efficient spiritual administration of the affairs of the Baha'i  world.    As to the spiritual activities of the \"Children of the Kingdom\" in  America, my hope and prayer is that they may grow to become efficient  servants of the Cause of Baha'u'llah. Their devotion and self-sacrifice,  their readiness to help the cause of the Baha'i Temple, their activity in  connection with the Baha'i Magazine are all unmistakable signs of the  glorious future of the Cause in that land. May the care and  loving-kindness of the Heavenly Father guide them, protect them and aid  them in their future mission in life.    The Greatest Holy Leaf, the Holy Mother, and the other ladies of the Holy  Household wish to join me, one and all, in expressing to every one of you  their deep thankfulness and their highest appreciation for the efficient  and admirable manner with which you are coordinating the dynamic forces of  the Cause, and conducting its affairs throughout America.    The sum of 100 English pounds which you have offered to the Cause through  me, I must acknowledge with deep appreciation and gratitude, and wish to  inform you that a part of it has been directly expended for the furthering  of the interests of the Cause throughout the world, and the rest for the  embellishment of the Well-Beloved's Shrine on Mount Carmel.    With deep gratitude, and hoping to hear from you, singly and collectively,  I am your true brother,    SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine.  November 26, 1923.          Letter of January 4th, 1924.      To the members of the American National Spiritual Assembly.    My dearest friends:    On November 28th I received the following communication from the President  of the National Spiritual Assembly of Great Britain:    \"I have now to bring to your notice, though possibly you are already aware  of it, a matter which is of the first importance in the opinion of the  National Spiritual Assembly as you will see from one of the paragraphs of  the enclosed minutes of its first meeting, which was held on October 13th.  So far the programme of the conference on the 'Living Religions within the  British Empire' is in a somewhat nebulous condition, but I have  ascertained from Miss Sharples, the honorary secretary of the committee of  organization, that the conference has been approved by the authorities of  the British Empire Exhibition 1924 and will last for ten days, covering  the last week of the month of September and the first three days of  October. It is proposed that all religions taught and practiced throughout  the British Empire shall be represented at the conference, including the  Christians, Muhammadans, Buddhists, Brahma Somaj, Theosophists and others,  and that each one in turn shall have at its disposal a day or part of a  day for a meeting to expound its principles and deal with its organization  and objects.\"    In their last letter, the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of  Great Britain further informed me that the idea of the above-mentioned  conference has originated with the Theosophical Society, but these having  later dropped its management, the organization of the conference passed  into the hands of the School of Oriental Studies and the Sociological  Society. You will also note from the enclosed copy of a letter addressed  by the same Miss Sharples to the President of the British National  Spiritual Assembly that the time offered to the Baha'i representatives  will be very limited, and that most probably the allotted time will be  just sufficient to read their papers or deliver their address and engage  in the discussion that might arise after their formal presentation of the  Cause.    As the British Empire Exhibition, of which this conference forms a part,  is itself a semi-official undertaking, and receives actually the generous  support and active participation of the government authorities throughout  the British Empire, I feel that the opportunities now offered to the  Baha'i world should not be missed, as this chance, if properly utilized,  might arouse and stimulate interest among the enlightened public.    As so much will depend upon the nature and general presentation of the  theme, rather than upon the personality of the reader or speaker, I feel  that, first and foremost, our attention should be concentrated on the  choice and thorough preparation of the subject matter as well as on the  proper drafting and the form of the paper itself, which might possibly  have to be submitted afterwards to the authorities of the conference.    I feel the necessity of entrusting this highly important and delicate task  to a special committee, to be appointed most carefully by the National  Spiritual Assembly of America, and consisting of those who by their  knowledge of the Cause, their experience in matters of publicity, and  particularly by their power of expression and beauty of style will be  qualified to produce a befitting statement on the unique history of the  Movement as well as its lofty principles.    I am enclosing an article on the Baha'i Movement which I trust might serve  as a basis and example of the paper in question. An account of the most  salient features of the history of the Cause, a brief but impressive  reference to its many heroes and martyrs, a convincing and comprehensive  presentation of its basic principles, and a characteristic survey of the  Master's life, as well as a short but graphic description of the present  position and influence of the Movement both in the East and the West,  should, in my opinion, be included and combined into one conclusive  argument. Its length should not surpass that of the enclosed article, and  its general tone, expression and language should be at once dignified,  sober and forceful.    The greatest care and caution must be exercised in choosing those who can  best provide and fulfill the above mentioned requisites and conditions.    I shall be most pleased to offer my views and suggestions once the paper  has assumed its final shape, and wish you to obtain the assistance and  advice of those whom you think able to judge amongst the friends in  England and elsewhere.    Mr. Simpson, the President of the British National Spiritual Assembly,  writes that Miss Grand from Canada has suggested the names of Dr. Watson  and Mr. J. O. McCarthy of Toronto to represent the Canadian Baha'is. I  would be pleased to receive your views as to who should represent Canada  at the Conference. India is the only other country within the British  Empire that can send a native Baha'i representative to the conference, and  it is rather unfortunate that the United States of America should have to  be excluded, as the speakers at the conference must necessarily be  subjects of the British Empire.    I am enclosing recent translations(11) of the prophetic and most  remarkable words of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha which I trust you will  all find of great value and interest in the great work you are doing for  the Cause.    May this great project yield an abundant harvest for the Cause, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19254"],[0,"Citadel of Faith (#13)"],[1,"in emergency campaign launched by  entire community will increasingly attract the promised inflowing grace of  the holy Author of its destinies, will demonstrate afresh its worthiness  of the paternal care of its divine Founder, will win added commendation  from its sister communities of the Eastern Hemisphere, deepen the  admiration and inspire the emulation of its daughter communities in Latin  America and the European continent, and strengthen the attachment and  reinforce the brotherly affection of its Guardian.

The zero hour is inexorably  approaching. Nineteen additional settlers can and must be provided.  Praying with increasing fervor for total success, complete victory.    [April 6, 1948]            MARVELOUS ACCELERATION  [FIRST MESSAGE TO 1948 CONVENTION]      I am moved to share with assembled delegates of the fortieth American  Baha'i Convention the following facts and figures testifying to the  present status of the World Faith of Baha'u'llah and disclosing the  marvelous acceleration in the double process of the extension of its range  and the consolidation of the institutions of its Administrative Order in  the Eastern and Western Hemispheres in the course of the first four years  of the second Baha'i century.    The number of countries opened to the Faith total ninety-one. Baha'i  literature is translated and printed in fifty-one languages.  Representatives of thirty-one races are enrolled in the Baha'i World  Community. Eighty-eight assemblies, national and local, are incorporated.  The number of localities where Baha'is have established residence has been  raised to over thirty in Australasia, to over forty in Germany and  Austria, over sixty in the Dominion of Canada, over eighty in the Indian  subcontinent and Burma, over one hundred in Latin America, over seven  hundred in Persia and to over twelve hundred in the United States of  America.    The value of international Baha'i endowments in the Holy Land and the  Jordan Valley is estimated at over six hundred thousand pounds. National  Baha'i endowments on the North American continent are valued at over two  million dollars. The area of land dedicated to the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar  in Persia is approximately four million square meters. The value of the  national Haziratu'l-Quds in the capitals of India and Persia respectively  is six hundred thousand rupees and fifty thousand pounds. The area of land  dedicated to the first Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar in South America is ninety  thousand square meters. The number of pieces of Baha'i literature sold and  distributed in the course of one year in North America is over eighty  thousand pieces. The record of the number of visitors to the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar in America in one year is over seventeen thousand  and the total number of visitors since its erection is over one quarter of  a million. The number of states in the American Union formally recognizing  Baha'i marriage certificates is now eight. The number of national  assemblies functioning in the Baha'i world is raised to nine through the  formation of the first Canadian National Assembly, to be shortly  reinforced through the constitution of two additional assemblies in South  and Central America and the West Indies.    The second seven-year, the six-year, the four and one-half year, the  six-year, the three-year, the five-year and forty-five month plans  respectively launched by the American, British, Indian, Australasian,  Iraqi, Canadian, and Persian National Spiritual Assemblies, some  culminating at the first Centennial of the birth of Baha'u'llah's mission,  others the Hundredth Anniversary of the Bab's Martyrdom, are aiming at the  establishment of three national assemblies in Canada and Latin America,  the completion of the interior ornamentation of the Mother Temple of the  West, the formation of spiritual assemblies in ten sovereign states of the  European continent, the constitution of nineteen assemblies in the British  Isles, doubling the number of assemblies in India, Pakistan and Burma, the  reconstitution of the dissolved assemblies and the establishment of  ninety-five new centers in Persia, the conversion of groups in Bahrein,  the Hijaz and Af_gh_anistan into assemblies, the formation of  administrative nuclei in the Arabian territories of Yemen, Oman, Hasa and  Kuweit; the formation of thirty-one groups and seven assemblies in  Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania; the multiplication of centers in the  provinces of 'Iraq, including the district of Shattu'l-Arab; the  incorporation of the Canadian National Assembly; doubling the number of  assemblies and raising to one hundred the centers in the Dominion of  Canada; the constitution of nuclei in Newfoundland and Greenland and the  participation of Eskimos and Red Indians in the local institutions of the  Administrative Order.    Plans and specifications have been prepared, and preliminary measures  taken, to place contracts for the arcade of the Bab's Sepulcher. Historic  International Baha'i Congresses held in South and Central America and an  inter-European Teaching Conference projected for Geneva paving the way for  future World Baha'i Congress. Recognition extended to the Faith by United  Nations as international non-governmental body, enabling appointment of  accredited representatives to United Nations conferences, is heralding  world recognition for a universal proclamation of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah.    [April 16, 1948]            BRILLIANT ACHIEVEMENTS  [SECOND MESSAGE TO 1948 CONVENTION]      Joyfully acclaim brilliant achievements transcending fondest hopes and  setting the seal of complete victory on the stupendous labors undertaken  by American Baha'i Community in the second year of the Second Seven Year  Plan. The constitution of the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada, the  heroic feat of raising to almost two hundred the number of spiritual  assemblies in the North American continent, the marvelous expansion of the  daughter communities in Latin America, the successful conclusion of the  preliminary phase of the interior ornamentation of the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, and the crowning exploit of the formation of no  less than seven assemblies in the newly opened transcontinental field,  endow with everlasting fame the second epoch of the Formative Age,  immeasurably enrich the annals of the opening decade of the second Baha'i  century, and constitute a landmark in the unfoldment of the second stage  of the execution of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Plan.    The primacy of the American Baha'i Community is reasserted, fully  vindicated and completely safeguarded. Recent successive victories  proclaim the undiminished strength and exemplary valor of the rank and  file of the community whether administrators, teachers or pioneers in  three continents regarded as the latest links in the chain of  uninterrupted achievements performed by its members in the council, and  teaching field for over a quarter of a century. I recall on this joyous  occasion with pride, emotion, thankfulness, the resplendent record of  stewardship of this dearly loved, richly endowed, unflinchingly resolute  community, whose administrators have assumed the preponderating share in  perfecting the machinery of the Administrative Order, whose elected  representatives have raised the edifice and completed the exterior  ornamentation of the Mother Temple of the West, whose trail-blazers opened  an overwhelming majority of the ninety-one countries now included within  the pale of the Faith, whose pioneers established flourishing communities  in twenty republics of Latin America, whose benefactors extended in ample  measure assistance in various ways to their sorely pressed brethren in  distant fields, whose members scattered themselves to thirteen hundred  centers in every state of the American Union, every province of the  Dominion of Canada, whose firmest champion succeeded in winning royalty's  allegiance to the Message of Baha'u'llah, whose heroes and martyrs laid  down their lives in its service in fields as remote as Honolulu, Buenos  Aires, Sidney, Isfahan, whose vanguard pushed its outposts to the  antipodes on the farthest verge of the South American continent, to the  vicinity of the Arctic Circle, to the northern, southern, and western  fringes of the European continent, whose ambassadors are now convening, on  the soil of one of the newly won territories, its historic first  conference designed to consolidate the newly won prizes, whose spokesmen  are securing recognition of the institutions of Baha'u'llah's rising World  Order in the United Nations.    Appeal to members of the community so privileged, so loved, so valorous,  endowed with such potentialities to unitedly press forward however  afflictive the trials their countrymen may yet experience, however  grievous the tribulations the land of their heart's desire may yet suffer,  however oppressive an anxiety the temporary severance of external  communications with the World Center of their Faith may engender, however  onerous the tasks still to be accomplished, until every single obligation  under the present Plan is honorably fulfilled, enabling them to launch in  its appointed time the third crusade destined to bring glorious  consummation to the first epoch in the evolution of their divinely  appointed world mission, fulfill the prophecy uttered by Daniel over  twenty centuries ago, contribute the major share of the world triumph of  the Faith of Baha'u'llah envisaged by the Center of His Covenant, and  hasten the opening of the Golden Age of the Baha'i Dispensation.
