Wherever I went I saw him, following the rivers for stranded trout and  salmon, or floating high in air where he could overlook two or three  wilderness lakes, with as many honest fish-hawks catching their  dinners. I had promised the curator of a museum that I would get him  an eagle that summer, and so took to hunting the great bird  diligently. But hunting was of little use, except to teach me many of  his ways and habits; for he seemed to have eyes and ears all over him;  and whether I crept like a snake through the woods, or floated like a  wild duck in my canoe over the water, he always saw or heard me, and  was off before I could get within shooting distance.    Then I tried to trap him. I placed two large trout, with a steel trap  between them, in a shallow spot on the river that I could watch from  my camp on a bluff, half a mile below. Next day Gillie, who was more  eager than I, set up a shout; and running out I saw Old Whitehead  standing in the shallows and flopping about the trap. We jumped into a  canoe and pushed up river in hot haste, singing in exultation that we  had the fierce old bird at last. When we doubled the last point that  hid the shallows, there was Old Whitehead, still tugging away at a  fish, and splashing the water not thirty yards away. I shall not soon  forget his attitude and expression as we shot round the point, his  body erect and rigid, his wings half spread, his head thrust forward,  eyelids drawn straight, and a strong fierce gleam of freedom and utter  wildness in his bright eyes. So he stood, a magnificent creature, till  we were almost upon him,--when he rose quietly, taking one of the  trout. The other was already in his stomach. He was not in the trap at  all, but had walked carefully round it. The splashing was made in  tearing one fish to pieces with his claws, and freeing the other from  a stake that held it.    After that he would not go near the shallows; for a new experience had  come into his life, leaving its shadow dark behind it. He who was king  of all he surveyed from the old blasted pine on the crag's top, who  had always heretofore been the hunter, now knew what it meant to be  hunted. And the fear of it was in his eyes, I think, and softened  their fierce gleam when I looked into them again, weeks later, by his  own nest on the mountain.    Simmo entered also into our hunting, but without enthusiasm or  confidence. He had chased the same eagle before--all one summer, in  fact, when a sportsman, whom he was guiding, had offered him twenty  dollars for the royal bird's skin. But Old Whitehead still wore it  triumphantly; and Simmo prophesied for him long life and a natural  death. \"No use hunt-um dat heagle,\" he said simply. \"I try once an'  can't get near him. He see everyt'ing; and wot he don't see, he hear.  'Sides, he kin _feel_ danger. Das why he build nest way off, long  ways, O don' know where.\" This last with a wave of his arm to include  the universe. Cheplahgan, Old Cloud Wings, he proudly called the bird  that had defied him in a summer's hunting.    At first I had hunted him like any other savage; partly, of course, to  get his skin for the curator; partly, perhaps, to save the settler's  lambs over on the Madawaska; but chiefly just to kill him, to exult in  his death flaps, and to rid the woods of a cruel tyrant. Gradually,  however, a change came over me as I hunted; I sought him less and less  for his skin and his life, and more and more for himself, to know all  about him. I used to watch him by the hour from my camp on the big  lake, sailing quietly over Caribou Point, after he had eaten with his  little ones, and was disposed to let Ismaquehs go on with his fishing  in peace. He would set his great wings to the breeze and sit like a  kite in the wind, mounting steadily in an immense spiral, up and up,  without the shadow of effort, till the eye grew dizzy in following.  And I loved to watch him, so strong, so free, so sure of  himself--round and round, up and ever up, without hurry, without  exertion; and every turn found the heavens nearer and the earth spread  wider below. Now head and tail gleam silver white in the sunshine now  he hangs motionless, a cross of jet that a lady might wear at her  throat, against the clear, unfathomable blue of the June  heavens--there! he is lost in the blue, so high that I cannot see any  more. But even as I turn away he plunges down into vision again,  dropping with folded wings straight down like a plummet, faster and  faster, larger and larger, through a terrifying rush of air, till I  spring to my feet and catch the breath, as if I myself were falling.  And just before he dashes himself to pieces he turns in the air, head  downward, and half spreads his wings, and goes shooting, slanting down  towards the lake, then up in a great curve to the tree tops, where he  can watch better what Kakagos, the rare woods-raven, is doing, and  what game he is hunting. For that is what Cheplahgan came down in such  a hurry to find out about.    Again he would come in the early morning; sweeping up river as if he  had already been a long day's journey, with the air of far-away and  far-to-go in his onward rush. And if I were at the trout pools, and  very still, I would hear the strong silken rustle of his wings as he  passed. At midday I would see him poised over the highest mountain-top  northward, at an enormous altitude, where the imagination itself could  not follow the splendid sweep of his vision; and at evening he would  cross the lake, moving westward into the sunset on tireless  pinions--always strong, noble, magnificent in his power and  loneliness, a perfect emblem of the great lonely magnificent  wilderness.    One day as I watched him, it swept over me suddenly that forest and  river would be incomplete without him. The thought of this came back  to me, and spared him to the wilderness, on the last occasion when I  went hunting for his life.    That was just after we reached the big lake, where I saw him robbing  the fish-hawk. After much searching and watching I found a great log  by the outlet where Old Whitehead often perched. There was a big eddy  hard by, on the edge of a shallow, and he used to sit on the log,  waiting for fish to come out where he could wade in and get them.  There was a sickness among the suckers that year (it comes regularly  every few years, as among rabbits), and they would come struggling out  of the deep water to rest on the sand, only to be caught by the minks  and fish-hawks and bears and Old Whitehead, all of whom were waiting  and hungry for fish.    For several days I put a big bait of trout and whitefish on the edge  of the shallows. The first two baits were put out late in the  afternoon, and a bear got them both the next night. Then I put them  out in the early morning, and before noon Cheplahgan had found them.  He came straight as a string from his watch place over the mountain,  miles away, causing me to wonder greatly what strange sixth sense  guided him; for sight and smell seemed equally out of the question.  The next day he came again. Then I placed the best bait of all in the  shallows, and hid in the dense underbrush near, with my gun.    He came at last, after hours of waiting, dropping from above the  tree-tops with a heavy rustling of pinions. And as he touched the old  log, and spread his broad white tail, I saw and was proud of the gap  which my bullet had made weeks before. He stood there a moment erect  and splendid, head, neck, and tail a shining white; even the dark  brown feathers of his body glinted in the bright sunshine. And he  turned his head slowly from side to side, his keen eyes flashing, as  if he would say, \"Behold, a king!\" to Chigwooltz the frog, and  Tookhees the wood mouse, and to any other chance wild creature that  might watch him from the underbrush at his unkingly act of feeding on  dead fish. Then he hopped down--rather awkwardly, it must be  confessed; for he is a creature of the upper deeps, who cannot bear to  touch the earth--seized a fish, which he tore to pieces with his claws  and ate greedily. Twice I tried to shoot him; but the thought of the  wilderness without him was upon me, and held me back. Then, too, it  seemed so mean to pot him from ambush when he had come down to earth,  where he was at a disadvantage; and when he clutched some of the  larger fish in his talons, and rose swiftly and bore away westward,  all desire to kill him was gone. There were little Cloud Wings, it  seemed, which I must also find and watch. After that I hunted him more  diligently than before, but without my gun. And a curious desire,  which I could not account for, took possession of me: to touch this  untamed, untouched creature of the clouds and mountains.    Next day I did it. There were thick bushes growing along one end of  the old log on which the eagle rested. Into these I cut a tunnel with  my hunting-knife, arranging the tops in such a way as to screen me  more effectively. Then I put out my bait, a good two hours before the  time of Old Whitehead's earliest appearance, and crawled into my den  to wait.    I had barely settled comfortably into my place, wondering how long  human patience could endure the sting of insects and the hot close air  without moving or stirring a leaf, when the heavy silken rustle  sounded close at hand, and I heard the grip of his talons on the log.  There he stood, at arm's length, turning his head uneasily, the light  glinting on his white crest, the fierce, untamed flash in his bright  eye. Never before had he seemed so big, so strong, so splendid; my  heart jumped at the thought of him as our national emblem. I am glad  still to have seen that emblem once, and felt the thrill of it.    But I had little time to think, for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15955"],[0,"A Short History of Scotland (#13)"],[1,"for France; and Angus  representing the English party.    Their forces met at Edinburgh in the street battle of \"Cleanse the  Causeway,\" wherein the Archbishop of Glasgow wore armour, and the  Douglases beat the Hamiltons out of the town (April 30, 1520).  Albany  returned (1521), but the nobles would not join with him in an English war  (1522).  Again he went to France, while Surrey devastated the Scottish  Border (1523).  Albany returned while Surrey was burning Jedburgh, was  once more deserted by the Scottish forces on the Tweed, and left the  country for ever in 1524.  Angus now returned from England; but the queen-  mother cast her affections on young Henry Stewart (Lord Methven), while  Angus got possession of the boy king (June 1526) and held him, a  reluctant ward, in the English interest.    Lennox was now the chief foe of Arran, and Angus, with whom Arran had  coalesced; and Lennox desired to deliver James out of Angus's hands.  On  July 26, 1526, not far from Melrose, Walter Scott of Buccleuch attacked  the forces guarding the prince; among them was Ker of Cessford, who was  slain by an Elliot when Buccleuch's men rallied at the rock called \"Turn  Again.\"  Hence sprang a long-enduring blood-feud of Scotts and Kers; but  Angus retained the prince, and in a later fight in the cause of James's  delivery, Lennox was slain by the Hamiltons, near Linlithgow.  The spring  of 1528 was marked by the burning of a Hamilton, Patrick, Abbot of Ferne,  at St Andrews, for his Lutheran opinions.  Angus had been making futile  attacks on the Border thieves, mainly the Armstrongs, who now became very  prominent and picturesque robbers.  He meant to carry James with him on  one of these expeditions; but in June 1528 the young king escaped from  Edinburgh Castle, and rode to Stirling, where he was welcomed by his  mother and her partisans.  Among them were Arran, Argyll, Moray,  Bothwell, and other nobles, with Maxwell and the Laird of Buccleuch, Sir  Walter Scott.  Angus and his kin were forfeited; he was driven across the  Border in November, to work what mischief he might against his country;  he did not return till the death of James V.  Meanwhile James was at  peace with his uncle, Henry VIII.  He (1529-1530) attempted to bring the  Border into his peace, and hanged Johnnie Armstrong of Gilnockie, with  circumstances of treachery, says the ballad,--as a ballad-maker was  certain to say.    Campbells, Macleans, and Macdonalds had all this while been burning each  other's lands, and cutting each other's throats.  James visited them, and  partly quieted them, incarcerating the Earl of Argyll.    Bothwell and Angus now conspired together to crown Henry VIII. in  Edinburgh; but, in May 1534, a treaty of peace was made, to last till the  death of either monarch and a year longer.          CHAPTER XV.  JAMES V. AND THE REFORMATION.      The new times were at the door.  In 1425 the Scottish Parliament had  forbidden Lutheran books to be imported.  But they were, of course,  smuggled in; and the seed of religious revolution fell on minds disgusted  by the greed and anarchy of the clerical fighters and jobbers of  benefices.    James V., after he had shaken off the Douglases and become \"a free king,\"  had to deal with a political and religious situation, out of which we may  say in the Scots phrase, \"there was no outgait.\"  His was the dilemma of  his father before Flodden.  How, against the perfidious ambition, the  force in war, and the purchasing powers of Henry VIII., was James to  preserve the national independence of Scotland?  His problem was even  harder than that of his father, because when Henry broke with Rome and  robbed the religious houses a large minority, at least, of the Scottish  nobles, gentry, and middle classes were, so far, heartily on the anti-  Roman side.  They were tired of Rome, tired of the profligacy, ignorance,  and insatiable greed of the ecclesiastical dignitaries who, too often,  were reckless cadets of the noble families.  Many Scots had read the  Lutheran books and disbelieved in transubstantiation; thought that money  paid for prayers to the dead was money wasted; preferred a married and  preaching to a celibate and licentious clergy who celebrated Mass; were  convinced that saintly images were idols, that saintly miracles were  impostures.  Above all, the nobles coveted the lands of the Church, the  spoils of the religious houses.    In Scotland, as elsewhere, the causes of the religious revolution were  many.  The wealth and luxury of the higher clergy, and of the dwellers in  the abbeys, had long been the butt of satire and of the fiercer  indignation of the people.  Benefices, great and small, were jobbed on  every side between the popes, the kings, and the great nobles.  Ignorant  and profligate cadets of the great houses were appointed to high  ecclesiastical offices, while the minor clergy were inconceivably  ignorant just at the moment when the new critical learning, with  knowledge of Hebrew and Greek, was revolutionising the study of the  sacred books.  The celibacy of the clergy had become a mere farce; and  they got dispensations enabling them to obtain ecclesiastical livings for  their bastards.  The kings set the worst example: both James IV. and  James V. secured the richest abbeys, and, in the case of James IV., the  Primacy, for their bastard sons.  All these abuses were of old standing.  \"Early in the thirteenth century certain of the abbots of Jedburgh,  supported by their chapters, had granted certain of their appropriate  churches to priests with a right of succession to their sons\" (see 'The  Mediaeval Church in Scotland,' by the late Bishop Dowden, chap. xix.  Mac-  Lehose, 1910.)  Oppressive customs by which \"the upmost claith,\" or a  pecuniary equivalent, was extorted as a kind of death-duty by the clergy,  were sanctioned by excommunication: no grievance was more bitterly felt  by the poor.  The once-dreaded curses on evil-doers became a popular  jest: purgatory was a mere excuse for getting money for masses.    In short, the whole mediaeval system was morally rotten; the statements  drawn up by councils which made vain attempts to check the stereotyped  abuses are as candid and copious concerning all these things as the  satires of Sir David Lyndsay.    Then came disbelief in mediaeval dogmas: the Lutheran and other heretical  books were secretly purchased and their contents assimilated.  Intercession of saints, images, pilgrimages, the doctrine of the  Eucharist, all fell into contempt.    As early as February 1428, as we have seen, the first Scottish martyr for  evangelical religion, Patrick Hamilton, was burned at St Andrews.  This  sufferer was the son of a bastard of that Lord Hamilton who married the  sister of James III.  As was usual, he obtained, when a little boy, an  abbey, that of Ferne in Ross-shire.  He drew the revenues, but did not  wear the costume of his place; in fact, he was an example of the ordinary  abuses.  Educated at Paris and Louvain, he came in contact with the  criticism of Erasmus and the Lutheran controversy.  He next read at St  Andrews, and he married.  Suspected of heresy in 1427, he retired to  Germany; he wrote theses called 'Patrick's Places,' which were reckoned  heretical; he was arrested, was offered by Archbishop Beaton a chance to  escape, disdained it, and was burned with unusual cruelty,--as a rule,  heretics in Scotland were strangled before burning.  There were other  similar cases, nor could James interfere--he was bound by his Coronation  Oath; again, he found in the bishops his best diplomatists, and they, of  course, were all for the French alliance, in the cause of the  independence of their country and Church as against Henry VIII.    Thus James, in justifiable dread of the unscrupulous ambition of Henry  VIII., could not run the English course, could not accept the varying  creeds which Henry, who was his own Pope, put forward as his spirit moved  him.  James was thus inevitably committed to the losing cause--the cause  of Catholicism and of France--while the intelligence no less than the  avarice of his nobles and gentry ran the English course.    James had practically no choice.  In 1536 Henry proposed a meeting with  James \"as far within England as possible.\"  Knowing, as we do, that Henry  was making repeated attempts to have James kidnapped and Archbishop  Beaton also, we are surprised that James was apparently delighted at the  hope of an interview with his uncle--in England.  Henry declined to  explain why he desired a meeting when James put the question to his  envoy.  James said, in effect, that he must act by advice of his Council,  which, so far as it was clerical, opposed the scheme.  Henry justified  the views of the Council, later, when James, returning from a visit to  France, asked permission to pass through England.  \"It is the king's  honour not to receive the King of Scots in his realm except as a vassal,  for there never came King of Scots into England in peaceful manner  otherwise.\"  Certain it is that, however James might enter England, he  would leave it only as a vassal.  Nevertheless his Council, especially  his clergy, are blamed for embroiling James with Henry by dissuading him  from meeting his uncle in England.  Manifestly they had no choice.  Henry  had shown his hand too often.    At this time James, by Margaret Erskine, became the father of James,  later the Regent Moray.  Strange tragedies would never have occurred had  the king first married Margaret Erskine, who, by 1536, was the wife of  Douglas of Loch Leven.  He is said to have wished for her a divorce that  he might marry her; this could not be: he visited France, and on New  Year's Day, 1537, wedded Madeline, daughter of Francis I.  Six months  later she died in Scotland.    Marriage for the king was necessary, and David Beaton, later Cardinal  Beaton and Archbishop of St Andrews, obtained for his lord a lady"]]]
