(#13)"],[1,"animal, but apprehensive that some might  mistake it, wrote under it, \"_This is a horse._\"    In forming our notions of what is signified by an adjective, the mind  should pause to determine the meaning of such word when used as a  distinct name for some object, in order to determine the import of it in  this new capacity. A _tallow_ candle is one made of a substance called  tallow, and is employed to distinguish it from wax or spermaceti  candles. The adjective in this case, names the article of which the  candle is made, and is thus a noun, but, as we are not speaking of  tallow, but of candles, we place it in a new relation, and give it a new  grammatical character. But you will perceive the correctness of a former  assertion, that all words may be reduced to two classes, and that  adjectives are derived from nouns or verbs.    But you may inquire if there are not some adjectives in use which have  no corresponding verb or noun from which they are derived. There are  many words in our language which in certain uses have become obsolete,  but are retained in others. We now use some words as verbs which  originally were known only as nouns, and others as nouns which are  unknown as verbs. We also put a new construction upon words and make  nouns, verbs and adjectives promiscuously and with little regard to rule  or propriety. Words at one time unknown become familiar by use, and  others are laid aside for those more new or fashionable. These facts are  so obvious that I shall be excused from extending my remarks to any  great length. But I will give an example which will serve as a clew to  the whole. Take the word _happy_, long known only as an adjective.  Instead of following this word _back_ to its primitive use and deriving  it directly from its noun, or as a past participle, such as it is in  truth, we have gone _forward_ and made from it the noun _happiness_,  and, in more modern days, are using the verb _happify_, a word, by the  way, in common use, but which has not yet been honored with a place in  our dictionaries; altho Mr. Webster has given us, as he says, the  _unauthorised_ (un-author-ised) word \"_happifying_.\" Perhaps he had  never heard or read some of our greatest savans, who, if not the  authors, employ the word _happify_ very frequently in the pulpit and  halls of legislation, and at the bar, as well as in common parlance.    _Happy_ is the past participle of the verb _to hap_, or, as afterwards  used, with a nice shade of change in the meaning, _to happen_. It means  _happied_, or made happy by those favorable circumstances which have  _happened_ to us. Whoever will read our old writers no further back than  Shakspeare, will at once see the use and changes of this word. They will  find it in all its forms, simple and compound, as a verb, noun, and  adjective. \"It may _hap_ that he will come.\" It happened as I was going  that I found my lost child, and was thereby made quite happy. The man  desired to _hap_pify himself and family without much labor, so he  engaged in speculation; and _hap_pily he was not so _hap_less in his  pursuit of _hap_piness as often _hap_pens to such _hap_-hazard fellows,  for he soon became very _hap_py with a moderate fortune.    But to the question. There are many adjectives in our language which are  borrowed from foreign words. Instead of _adjectiving_ our own nouns we  go to our neighbors and _adjective_ and anglicise [english-ise] their  words, and adopt the pampered urchins into our own family and call them  our favorites. It is no wonder that they often appear aukward and  unfamiliar, and that our children are slow in forming an intimate  acquaintance with them. You are here favored with a short list of these  words which will serve as examples, and enable you to comprehend my  meaning and apply it in future use. Some of them are regularly used as  adjectives, with or without change; others are not.        ENGLISH NOUNS.   FOREIGN ADJECTIVES.

introduced into our language from other  nations. The list will enable you to discover that when we have no  adjective of our own to correspond with the noun, we borrow from our  neighbors an adjective derived from one of their nouns, to which we give  an english termination. For example:        _English Noun._    _Latin Noun._        _Adjective._        Boy                Puer                 Puerile      Grief              Dolor                Dolorous      Thought            Pensa                Pensive      Wife               Uxor                 Uxorious      Word               Verbum               Verbal, verbose      Year               Annum                Annual      Body               Corpus               Corporeal      Head               Caput                Capital      Church             Ekklesia (_Greek_"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17607"],[0,"Superstition In All Ages (1732) (#13)"],[1," themselves involuntarily to him; in short, by a multitude of  events and accidents which are beyond his control. Incapable of  foreseeing the future, he knows neither what he will wish, nor what he  will do in the time which must immediately follow the present. Man  passes his life, from the moment of his birth to that of his death,  without having been free one instant. Man, you say, wishes, deliberates,  chooses, determines; hence you conclude that his actions are free. It is  true that man intends, but he is not master of his will or of his  desires. He can desire and wish only what he judges advantageous for  himself; he can not love pain nor detest pleasure. Man, it will be said,  sometimes prefers pain to pleasure; but then, he prefers a passing pain  in the hope of procuring a greater and more durable pleasure. In this  case, the idea of a greater good determines him to deprive himself of  one less desirable.    It is not the lover who gives to his mistress the features by which he  is enchanted; he is not then the master to love or not to love the  object of his tenderness; he is not the master of the imagination or the  temperament which dominates him; from which it follows, evidently, that  man is not the master of the wishes and desires which rise in his soul,  independently of him. But man, say you, can resist his desires; then he  is free. Man resists his desires when the motives which turn him from an  object are stronger than those which draw him toward it; but then, his  resistance is necessary. A man who fears dishonor and punishment more  than he loves money, resists necessarily the desire to take possession  of another's money. Are we not free when we deliberate?--but has one the  power to know or not to know, to be uncertain or to be assured?  Deliberation is the necessary effect of the uncertainty in which we find  ourselves with reference to the results of our actions. As soon as we  believe ourselves certain of these results, we necessarily decide; and  then we act necessarily according as we shall have judged right or  wrong. Our judgments, true or false, are not free; they are necessarily  determined by ideas which we have received, or which our mind has  formed. Man is not free in his choice; he is evidently compelled to  choose what he judges the most useful or the most agreeable for himself.  When he suspends his choice, he is not more free; he is forced to  suspend it till he knows or believes he knows the qualities of the  objects presented to him, or until he has weighed the consequence of his  actions. Man, you will say, decides every moment on actions which he  knows will endanger him; man kills himself sometimes, then he is free. I  deny it! Has man the ability to reason correctly or incorrectly? Do not  his reason and his wisdom depend either upon opinions that he has  formed, or upon his mental constitution? As neither the one nor the  other depends upon his will, they can not in any wise prove his liberty.    If I make the wager to do or not to do a thing, am I not free? Does it  not depend upon me to do or not to do it? No; I will answer you, the  desire to win the wager will necessarily determine you to do or not to  do the thing in question. \"But if I consent to lose the wager?\" Then the  desire to prove to me that you are free will have become to you a  stronger motive than the desire to win the wager; and this motive will  necessarily have determined you to do or not to do what was understood  between us. But you will say, \"I feel myself free.\" It is an illusion  which may be compared to that of the fly in the fable, which, lighting  on the shaft of a heavy wagon, applauded itself as driver of the vehicle  which carried it. Man who believes himself free, is a fly who believes  himself the master-motor in the machine of the universe, while he  himself, without his own volition, is carried on by it. The feeling  which makes us believe that we are free to do or not to do a thing, is  but a pure illusion. When we come to the veritable principle of our  actions, we will find that they are nothing but the necessary results of  our wills and of our desires, which are never within our power. You  believe yourselves free because you do as you choose; but are you really  free to will or not to will, to desire or not to desire? Your wills and  your desires, are they not necessarily excited by objects or by  qualities which do not depend upon you at all?          LXXXI.--WE SHOULD NOT CONCLUDE FROM THIS THAT SOCIETY HAS NOT THE RIGHT  TO CHASTISE THE WICKED.    If the actions of men are necessary, if men are not free, what right has  society to punish the wicked who infest it? Is it not very unjust to  chastise beings who could not act otherwise than they did? If the wicked  act from the impulse of their corrupt nature, society in punishing them  acts necessarily on its side from the desire to preserve itself. Certain  objects produce in us the feeling of pain; therefore our nature compels  us to hate them, and incites us to remove them. A tiger pressed by  hunger, attacks the man whom he wishes to devour; but the man is not the  master of his fear of the tiger, and seeks necessarily the means of  exterminating it.          LXXXII.--REFUTATION OF THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF FREE WILL.    If everything is necessary, if errors, opinions, and ideas of men are  fated, how or why can we pretend to reform them? The errors of men are  the necessary results of their ignorance; their ignorance, their  obstinacy, their credulity, are the necessary results of their  inexperience, of their indifference, of their lack of reflection; the  same as congestion of the brain or lethargy are the natural effects of  some diseases. Truth, experience, reflection, reason, are the proper  remedies to cure ignorance, fanaticism, and follies; the same as  bleeding is good to soothe congestion of the brain. But you will say,  why does not truth produce this effect upon many of the sick heads?  There are some diseases which resist all remedies; it is impossible to  cure obstinate patients who refuse to take the remedies which are given  them; the interest of some men and the folly of others naturally oppose  them to the admission of truth. A cause produces its effect only when it  is not interrupted in its action by other causes which are stronger, or  which weaken the action of the first cause or render it useless. It is  entirely impossible to have the best arguments accepted by men who are  strongly interested in error; who are prejudiced in its favor; who  refuse to reflect; but it must necessarily be that truth undeceives the  honest souls who seek it in good faith. Truth is a cause; it produces  necessarily its effect when its impulse is not interrupted by causes  which suspend its effects.          LXXXIII.--CONTINUATION.    To take away from man his free will, is, we are told, to make of him a  pure machine, an automaton without liberty; there would exist in him  neither merit nor virtue What is merit in man?    It is a certain manner of acting which renders him estimable in the eyes  of his fellow beings. What is virtue? It is the disposition that causes  us to do good to others. What can there be contemptible in automatic  machines capable of producing such desirable effects? Marcus Aurelius  was a very useful spring to the vast machine of the Roman Empire. By  what right will a machine despise another machine, whose springs would  facilitate its own play? Good people are springs which assist society in  its tendency to happiness; wicked men are badly-formed springs, which  disturb the order, the progress, and harmony of society. If for its own  interests society loves and rewards the good, she hates, despises, and  removes the wicked, as useless or dangerous motors.          LXXXIV.--GOD HIMSELF, IF THERE WAS A GOD, WOULD NOT BE FREE; HENCE THE  USELESSNESS OF ALL RELIGION.    The world is a necessary agent; all the beings which compose it are  united to each other, and can not do otherwise than they do, so long as  they are moved by the same causes and possessed of the same qualities.  If they lose these qualities, they will act necessarily in a different  way. God Himself (admitting His existence a moment) can not be regarded  as a free agent; if there existed a God, His manner of acting would  necessarily be determined by the qualities inherent in His nature;  nothing would be able to alter or to oppose His wishes. This considered,  neither our actions nor our prayers nor our sacrifices could suspend or  change His invariable progress and His immutable designs, from which we  are compelled to conclude that all religion would be entirely useless.          LXXXV.--EVEN ACCORDING TO THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES, MAN IS NOT FREE ONE  INSTANT.    If theologians were not constantly contradicting each other, they would  know, from their own hypotheses, that man can not be called free for an  instant. Is not man supposed to be in a continual dependence upon God?  Is one free, when one could not have existed or can not live without  God, and when one ceases to exist at the pleasure of His supreme will?  If God created man of nothing, if the preservation of man is a continual  creation, if God can not lose sight of His creature for an instant, if  all that happens to him is a result of the Divine will, if man is  nothing of himself, if all the events which he experiences are the  effects of Divine decrees, if he can not do any good without assistance  from above, how can it be pretended that man enjoys liberty during one  moment of his life? If God did not save him in the moment when he sins,  how could man sin? If God preserves him, God, therefore, forces him to  live in order to sin.          LXXXVI.--ALL EVIL, ALL DISORDER, ALL SIN, CAN BE ATTRIBUTED BUT TO GOD;  AND CONSEQUENTLY, HE HAS NO RIGHT TO PUNISH OR REWARD.    Divinity is continually compared to a king, the majority of whose  subjects revolt"]]]
