There were all sorts of scenes, including some which were  very funny and made the boys and girls shriek with laughter. One was a  boy on a donkey, and another two fat men trying to climb over a fence.  Then came a number of pictures made from photograph negatives, showing  scenes in and around Lakeport. There were the lake steamer, and the main  street, and one picture of the girls and boys rushing out of school at  dinner time. The last was voted the best of all, and many present tried  to pick themselves out of this picture and did so.    After the exhibition was over one of the largest of the girls sat down  to the piano and played. By this time some of the older folks drifted  in, and they called for some singing, and all joined in half a dozen  songs that were familiar to them. Then the young folks ran off for their  coats and caps and wraps, and bid their host and hostess and each other  good-night.    \"Wasn't it splendid?\" said Nan, on the way home. \"I never had such a  good time before.\"    \"Didn't last half long enough,\" said Freddie. \"Want it to last longer  next time.\"    \"I wanted my cow to last longer,\" said Flossie. \"Oh, if only I could  have kept it from melting!\"          CHAPTER XVI    A GRAND SLEIGH RIDE      For a long while all of the Bobbsey children had been begging their  parents for a sleigh ride into the country.    \"The winter will be gone soon, papa,\" said Nan. \"Won't you take us  before the snow is all gone?\"    \"You may as well take them, Richard,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.    \"Well, if I do, Mary, you must go along,\" answered Mr. Bobbsey, and so  it was arranged that they should take the ride on the following  Saturday, weather permitting.    You may well suppose that all of the twins were very anxious about the  weather after that, for Mr. Bobbsey said he would not go if it rained or  if it snowed very hard.    \"What does it say in the newspapers?\" asked Freddie. \"They always know  what the weather is going to be.\"    \"Not so far ahead as that,\" answered his brother.    But Friday evening the paper said cold and clear, and sure enough, on  Saturday morning it was as nice as one would wish. From behind masses of  thin clouds the sun peeped shyly, lighting up the snow until it shone  like huge beds of diamonds.    They were to drive to Dalton, twelve miles away. Mr. Bobbsey had learned  that the road to Dalton was in good condition, and the family had  friends there who would be pleased to see them and have them remain to  dinner.    By half-past nine the big family sleigh was at the door, with Sam on the  front seat, driving. Into the sleigh piled the four children, and Mr.  and Mrs. Bobbsey followed.    \"Want to sit by Sam and help drive,\" said Freddie, and he was lifted  over to the desired position. Then off they went, with a crack of the  whip and jingling of sleigh-bells that could be heard a long distance.    \"Oh, but isn't this just too splendid for anything!\" exclaimed Nan, who  sat at one side of the seat, with her mamma on the other and Flossie  between them. \"I do love sleigh riding so much!\"    \"See me drive!\" cried Freddie, who held the very end of the reins, the  part dangling from Sam's hands.    \"Well, Freddie, don't let the team run away,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, with a  laugh.    \"I shan't,\" answered the little fellow soberly. \"If they try to run  away, I'll whip them good.\"    \"You'll never stop them that way,\" said Bert. \"You want to talk gently  to them.\"    On and on they went, over the smooth snow. The horses were fresh and  full of spirit, and mile after mile was passed with a speed that pleased  all of the twins very much. They passed several other sleighing parties,  and every time this was done the children set up a merry shout which was  sure to call forth an equally merry answer.    A large part of the ride was through the country, and often the country  folks would come to the doors to see them pass. Once they met a boy on  the road and he asked for a ride to his home, half a mile away.    \"Yes, jump in,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, and the boy got in and was taken to  his house almost before he knew it.    \"Much obliged,\" he said on leaving them. \"You're fine people, you are,\"  and he took off his hat at parting.    \"It was nice to give him a ride,\" said Nan. \"It didn't cost us anything  and he liked it a great deal, I am sure.\"    \"We must never forget to do a kindness when we can, Nan,\" said her  mamma.    Before noon Dalton was reached and they drove up to the home of Mr.  Ramdell, as their friend was named. Immediately Bob Ramdell, a youth of  sixteen, rushed eagerly out to greet Bert.    \"I'm glad you've come,\" he cried. \"I've been watching for you for an  hour.\"    \"It isn't noon yet,\" answered Bert.    All were soon into the house and Sam drove the sleigh around to the  barn. Bob Ramdell had a sister Susie, who was almost Nan's age, and a  baby brother called Tootsie, although his real name was Alexander. Susie  was glad to see Nan and Flossie, and all were soon playing with the  baby, who was just old enough to be amusing.    \"I've got a plan on hand,\" whispered Bob to Bert, just before dinner was  served. \"I've been wondering if your father will let us carry it out.\"    \"What is it?\" questioned Bert.    \"You are not to drive home until late this afternoon. I wonder if your  father won't let you go down to Long Lake with me after dinner, to see  the hockey match.\"    \"Is it far from here?\"    \"About two miles. We can drive down in our cutter. Father will let me  have the cutter and old Rusher, I'm sure.\"    \"I'll see about it,\" said Bert. \"I'd like to see the hockey match very  much.\"    As soon as he got the chance Bert questioned his parent about going.    \"I don't know about this,\" said Mr. Bobbsey slowly. \"Do you think you  two boys can be trusted alone with the horse?\"    \"Oh, yes, papa. Bob has driven old Rusher many times.\"    \"You must remember, Rusher used to be a race horse. He may run away  with Bob and you.\"    \"Oh, but that was years ago, papa. He is too old to run away now. Please  say yes.\"    Bert continued to plead, and in the end Mr. Bobbsey gave him permission  to go to the hockey match.    \"But you must be back before five o'clock,\" said he. \"We are going to  start for home at that time.\"    The dinner was a fine one and tasted especially good to the children  after their long ride. But Bert and Bob were impatient to be off, and  left the moment they had disposed of their pieces of pie.    Old Rusher was a black steed which, in years gone by, had won many a  race on the track. He had belonged to a brother to Mr. Ramdell, who had  died rather suddenly two years before. He was, as Bert had said, rather  old, but there was still a good deal of fire left in him, as the boys  were soon to discover to their cost.    The road to Long Lake was a winding one, up one hill and down another,  and around a sharp turn where in years gone by there had been a sand  pit.    In the best of spirits the two boys started off, Bob handling the reins  like a veteran driver. Bob loved horses, and his one ambition in life  was to handle a \"spanking team,\" as he called it.    \"Old Rusher can go yet,\" said Bert, who enjoyed the manner in which the  black steed stepped out. \"He must have been a famous race horse in his  day.\"    \"He was,\" answered Bob. \"He won ever so many prizes.\"    The distance to Long Lake was covered almost before Bert knew it. As the  hockey game was not yet begun they spent half an hour in driving over  the road that led around the lake.    Quite a crowd had gathered, some in sleighs and some on foot, and the  surface of the lake was covered with skaters. When the hockey game  started the crowd watched every move with interest.    It was a \"hot\" game, according to Bert, and when a clever play was made  he applauded as loudly as the rest. When the game was at an end he was  sorry to discover that it was after four o'clock.    \"We must get home,\" said he to Bob. \"I promised to be back by five.\"    \"Oh, we'll get back in no time,\" said Bob. \"Remember, Rusher has had a  good rest.\"    They were soon on the road again, Rusher kicking up his heels livelier  than before, for the run down to the lake had merely enabled him to get  the stiffness out of his limbs.    Sleighs were on all sides and, as the two boys drove along, two  different sleighing parties passed them.    \"Hullo, Ramdell!\" shouted a young man in a cutter. \"Got out old Rusher,  I see. Want a race?\"    \"I think I can beat you!\" shouted back Bob, and in a moment more the two  cutters were side by side, and each horse and driver doing his best to  win.    \"Oh, Bob, can you hold him?\" cried Bert.    \"To be sure I can!\" answered Bob. \"Just you let me alone and see.\"    \"Come on!\" yelled the stranger. \"Come on, or I'll leave you behind in no  time!\"    \"You'll not leave me behind so quickly,\" answered Bob. \"Go it, Rusher,  go it!\" he added to his horse, and the steed flew over the smooth road  at a rate of speed that filled Bert with astonishment.          CHAPTER XVII    THE RACE AND THE RUNAWAY      Bert loved to ride and drive, but it must be confessed that he did not  enjoy racing.    The road was rather uneven, and he could not help but think what the  consequences might be if the cutter should strike a deep hollow or a big  stone.    \"Don't let Rusher run away,\" he said to his friend. \"Be careful.\"    Bob was by this time having his hands so full that he could not answer.    \"Steady, Rusher, steady!\" he called out to the steed. \"Steady, old boy!\"    But the old race horse was now warmed up to his work and paid no  attention to what was said. On and on he sped, until the young man in  the other cutter was gradually outdistanced.    \"Told you I could beat you!\" flung back Bob.    \"The race is yours,\" answered the young man, in much disappointment, and  then he dropped further back than ever.    \"Better slacken up, Bob,\" said Bert. \"There is no use in driving so hard  now.\"    \"I-"]]]
