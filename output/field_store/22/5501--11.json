Of the profits of these American companies Leopold is to  receive one-half. He will work his rubber with slaves.    Are the Americans going to use slaves also, or do they intend \"on  commercial lines\" to pay those who work for them living wages? And  if they do, at the end of the fiscal year, having paid a fair price  for labor, are they prepared to accept a smaller profit than will  their partner Leopold, who obtains his labor with the aid of a chain  and a whip?     [Illustration: The Laboring Man Upon Whom the American   Concessionaires Must Depend.]    The attorney for the company airily says: \"The labor problem will  not be formidable.\"    If the man knows what he is talking about, he can mean but one  thing.    The motives that led Leopold to grant these concessions are possibly  various. The motives that induced the Americans to take his offer  were probably less complicated. With them it was no question of  politics. They wanted the money; they did not need it, for they all  are rich--they merely wanted it. But Leopold wants more than the  half profits he will obtain from the Americans. If the Powers should  wake from their apathy and try to cast him out of the Congo, he  wants, through his American partners, the help of the United States.  Should he be \"dethroned,\" by granting these concessions now on a  share and share alike basis with Belgians, French, and Americans, he  still, through them, hopes to draw from the Congo a fair income. And  in the meanwhile he looks to these Americans to kill any action  against him that may be taken in our Senate and House of  Representatives, even in the White House and Department of State.    For the last two years Chester A. Beatty has been visiting Leopold  at Belgium, and has obtained the two concessions, and Leopold has  obtained, or hopes he has obtained, the influence of many American  shareholders. The fact that the people of the United States  possessed no \"vested interest\" in the Congo was the important fact  that placed any action on our part in behalf of that distressed  country above suspicion. If we acted, we did so because the United  States, as one of the signatory Powers of the Berlin Act, had  promised to protect the natives of the Congo; and we could truly  claim that we acted only in the name of humanity. Leopold has now  robbed us of that claim. He hopes that the enormous power wielded by  the Americans with whom he is associated, will prevent any action  against him in this country.    But the deal has already been made public, and the motives of those  who now oppose improvement of conditions in the Congo, and who  support Leopold, will be at once suspected.    To me the most interesting thing about the tract of land ceded to  Mr. Ryan, apart from the number of hippopotamuses I saw on it, was  that the people living along the Congo say that it is of no value.  They told me that two years ago, after working it for some time,  Leopold abandoned it as unprofitable, and they added that, when  Leopold cannot whip rubber out of the forest, it is hard to believe  that it can be obtained there legitimately by any one else. On the  bank I saw the \"factories\" to which the unprofitable rubber had been  carried from the interior. They had formerly belonged to Leopold,  now they are the property of Mr. Ryan and of the American Congo  Company. In only two years they already are in ruins, and the jungle  has engulfed them.    I was on the land owned by the company a dozen times or more, but I  did not go into the interior. Even had I done so, I am not an expert  on rubber, and would have understood nothing of Para trees, Lagos  silk, and liane. I am speaking not of my own knowledge, only of what  was told me by people who live on the spot. I found that this  particular concession was well known, because, unlike the land given  to the Forestry and Mines Company, it is not an inaccessible tract,  but is situated only eight miles from Leopoldville. In our language,  that is about as far as is the Battery to 160th Street. Leopoldville  is the chief place on the Congo River, and every one there who spoke  to me of the concession knew where it was situated, and repeated  that it had been given up by Leopold as unprofitable, and that he  had unloaded it on Mr. Ryan. They seem to think it very clever of  the King to have got rid of it to the American millionaire. To one  knowing Mr. Ryan only from what he reads of him in the public press,  he does not seem to be the sort of man to whom Leopold could sell a  worthless rubber plantation. However, it is a matter which concerns  only Mr. Ryan and those who may think of purchasing shares in the  company. The Guggenheims, who are to operate this rubber, say that  Leopold did not know how to get out the full value of the land, and  that they, by using the machinery they will install, will be able to  make a profit, where Leopold, using only native labor, suffered a  loss.    To the poor the ways of the truly rich are past finding out. After a  man has attained a fortune sufficient to keep him in yachts and  automobiles, one would think he could afford to indulge himself in  the luxury of being squeamish; that as to where he obtained any  further increase of wealth, he would prefer to pick and choose.    On the contrary, these Americans go as far out of their way as  Belgium to make a partner of the man who has wrung his money from  wretched slaves, who were beaten, starved, and driven in chains.  This concession cannot make them rich. It can only make them richer.  And not richer in fact, for all the money they may whip out of the  Congo could not give them one thing that they cannot now command,  not an extra taste to the lips, not a fresh sensation, not one added  power for good. To them it can mean only a figure in ink on a page  of a bank-book. But what suffering, what misery it may mean to the  slaves who put it there! Why should men as rich as these elect to go  into partnership with one who sweats his dollars out of the naked  black? How really fine, how really wonderful it would be if these  same men, working together, decided to set free these twenty million  people--if, instead of joining hands with Leopold, they would  overthrow him and march into the Congo free men, without his chain  around their ankles, and open it to the trade of the world, and give  justice and a right to live and to work and to sell and buy to  millions of miserable human beings. These Americans working together  could do it. They could do it from Washington. Or five hundred men  with two Maxim guns could do it. The \"kingdom\" of the Congo is only  a house of cards. Five hundred filibusters could take Boma, proclaim  the Congo open to the traders of the world, as the Act of Berlin  declares it to be, and in a day make of Leopold the jest of Europe.  They would only be taking possession of what has always belonged to  them.    Down in the Congo I talked to many young officers of Leopold's army.  They had been driven to serve him by the whips of failure, poverty,  or crime. I do not know that the American concessionaires are driven  by any such scourge. These younger men, who saw the depths of their  degradation, who tasted the dirty work they were doing, were daily  risking life by fever, through lack of food, by poisoned arrows,  and for three hundred dollars a year. Their necessity was great.  They had the courage of their failure. They were men one could pity.  One of them picked at the band of blue and gold braid around the  wrist of his tunic, and said: \"Look, it is our badge of shame.\"    To me those foreign soldiers of fortune, who, sooner than starve at  home or go to jail, serve Leopold in the jungle, seem more like men  and brothers than these truly rich, who, of their own free will,  safe in their downtown offices, become partners with this blackguard  King.    What will be the outcome of the American advance into the Congo?  Will it prove the salvation of the Congo? Will it be, if that were  possible, a greater evil?    E.R. Morel, who is the leader in England of the movement for the  improvement of the Congo, has written: \"It is a little difficult to  imagine that the trust magnates are moulded upon the unique model of  Leopold II, and are prepared for the asking to become associates in  slave-driving. The trouble is that they probably know nothing about  African conditions, that they have been primed by the King with his  detestable theories, and are starting their enterprises on the basis  that the natives of Central Africa must be regarded as mere  'laborers' for the white man's benefit, possessing no rights in land  nor in the produce of the soil. If Mr. Ryan and his colleagues are  going to acquire their rubber over four thousand square miles, by  'commercial methods,' we welcome their advent. But we would point  out to them that, in such a case, they had better at once abandon  all idea of three or four hundred per cent dividends with which the  wily autocrat at Brussels has doubtless primed them. No such  monstrous profits are to be acquired in tropical Africa under a  trade system. If, on the other hand, the methods they are prepared  to adopt are the methods King Leopold and his other concessionaires  have adopted for the past thirteen years, devastation and  destruction, and the raising of more large bodies of soldiers, are  their essential accompaniments; and the widening of the area of the  Congo hell is assured.\"    The two things in the American invasion of the Congo that promise  good to that unhappy country are that our country is represented at  Boma by a most intelligent, honest, and fearless young man in the  person of James A. Smith, our Consul-General, and that the actual  work of operating the mines and rubber is in the hands of the  Guggenheims. They are well known as men upright in affairs, and as  philanthropists and humanitarians"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1430"],[0,"Beautiful Stories from Shakespeare (#13)"],[1,"s; and now, wild with grief, he  leaped into his sister's grave, to clasp her in his arms once more.    \"I loved her more than forty thousand brothers,\" cried Hamlet, and leapt  into the grave after him, and they fought till they were parted.    Afterwards Hamlet begged Laertes to forgive him.    \"I could not bear,\" he said, \"that any, even a brother, should seem to  love her more than I.\"    But the wicked Claudius would not let them be friends. He told Laertes  how Hamlet had killed old Polonius, and between them they made a plot to  slay Hamlet by treachery.    Laertes challenged him to a fencing match, and all the Court were  present. Hamlet had the blunt foil always used in fencing, but Laertes  had prepared for himself a sword, sharp, and tipped with poison. And the  wicked King had made ready a bowl of poisoned wine, which he meant  to give poor Hamlet when he should grow warm with the sword play, and  should call for drink.    So Laertes and Hamlet fought, and Laertes, after some fencing, gave  Hamlet a sharp sword thrust. Hamlet, angry at this treachery--for  they had been fencing, not as men fight, but as they play--closed with  Laertes in a struggle; both dropped their swords, and when they picked  them up again, Hamlet, without noticing it, had exchanged his own blunt  sword for Laertes' sharp and poisoned one. And with one thrust of it he  pierced Laertes, who fell dead by his own treachery.    At this moment the Queen cried out, \"The drink, the drink! Oh, my dear  Hamlet! I am poisoned!\"    She had drunk of the poisoned bowl the King had prepared for Hamlet, and  the King saw the Queen, whom, wicked as he was, he really loved, fall  dead by his means.    Then Ophelia being dead, and Polonius, and the Queen, and Laertes, and  the two courtiers who had been sent to England, Hamlet at last found  courage to do the ghost's bidding and avenge his father's murder--which,  if he had braced up his heart to do long before, all these lives  had been spared, and none had suffered but the wicked King, who well  deserved to die.    Hamlet, his heart at last being great enough to do the deed he ought,  turned the poisoned sword on the false King.    \"Then--venom--do thy work!\" he cried, and the King died.    So Hamlet in the end kept the promise he had made his father. And all  being now accomplished, he himself died. And those who stood by saw him  die, with prayers and tears, for his friends and his people loved him  with their whole hearts. Thus ends the tragic tale of Hamlet, Prince of  Denmark.          CYMBELINE        Cymbeline was the King of Britain. He had three children. The two sons  were stolen away from him when they were quite little children, and he  was left with only one daughter, Imogen. The King married a second  time, and brought up Leonatus, the son of a dear friend, as Imogen's  playfellow; and when Leonatus was old enough, Imogen secretly married  him. This made the King and Queen very angry, and the King, to punish  Leonatus, banished him from Britain.    Poor Imogen was nearly heart-broken at parting from Leonatus, and he was  not less unhappy. For they were not only lovers and husband and wife,  but they had been friends and comrades ever since they were quite little  children. With many tears and kisses they said \"Good-bye.\" They promised  never to forget each other, and that they would never care for anyone  else as long as they lived.    \"This diamond was my mother's, love,\" said Imogen; \"take it, my heart,  and keep it as long as you love me.\"    \"Sweetest, fairest,\" answered Leonatus, \"wear this bracelet for my  sake.\"    \"Ah!\" cried Imogen, weeping, \"when shall we meet again?\"    And while they were still in each other's arms, the King came in, and  Leonatus had to leave without more farewell.    When he was come to Rome, where he had gone to stay with an old friend  of his father's, he spent his days still in thinking of his dear Imogen,  and his nights in dreaming of her. One day at a feast some Italian and  French noblemen were talking of their sweethearts, and swearing that  they were the most faithful and honorable and beautiful ladies in the  world. And a Frenchman reminded Leonatus how he had said many times that  his wife Imogen was more fair, wise, and constant than any of the ladies  in France.    \"I say so still,\" said Leonatus.    \"She is not so good but that she would deceive,\" said Iachimo, one of  the Italian nobles.    \"She never would deceive,\" said Leonatus.    \"I wager,\" said Iachimo, \"that, if I go to Britain, I can persuade your  wife to do whatever I wish, even if it should be against your wishes.\"    \"That you will never do,\" said Leonatus. \"I wager this ring upon my  finger,\" which was the very ring Imogen had given him at parting, \"that  my wife will keep all her vows to me, and that you will never persuade  her to do otherwise.\"    So Iachimo wagered half his estate against the ring on Leonatus's  finger, and started forthwith for Britain, with a letter of introduction  to Leonatus's wife. When he reached there he was received with all  kindness; but he was still determined to win his wager.    He told Imogen that her husband thought no more of her, and went on to  tell many cruel lies about him. Imogen listened at first, but presently  perceived what a wicked person Iachimo was, and ordered him to leave  her. Then he said--    \"Pardon me, fair lady, all that I have said is untrue. I only told you  this to see whether you would believe me, or whether you were as much to  be trusted as your husband thinks. Will you forgive me?\"    \"I forgive you freely,\" said Imogen.    \"Then,\" went on Iachimo, \"perhaps you will prove it by taking charge of  a trunk, containing a number of jewels which your husband and I and some  other gentlemen have bought as a present for the Emperor of Rome.\"    \"I will indeed,\" said Imogen, \"do anything for my husband and a friend  of my husband's. Have the jewels sent into my room, and I will take care  of them.\"    \"It is only for one night,\" said Iachimo, \"for I leave Britain again  to-morrow.\"    So the trunk was carried into Imogen's room, and that night she went to  bed and to sleep. When she was fast asleep, the lid of the trunk opened  and a man got out. It was Iachimo. The story about the jewels was as  untrue as the rest of the things he had said. He had only wished to get  into her room to win his wicked wager. He looked about him and noticed  the furniture, and then crept to the side of the bed where Imogen  was asleep and took from her arm the gold bracelet which had been the  parting gift of her husband. Then he crept back to the trunk, and next  morning sailed for Rome.    When he met Leonatus, he said--    \"I have been to Britain and I have won the wager, for your wife no  longer thinks about you. She stayed talking with me all one night in her  room, which is hung with tapestry and has a carved chimney-piece, and  silver andirons in the shape of two winking Cupids.\"    \"I do not believe she has forgotten me; I do not believe she stayed  talking with you in her room. You have heard her room described by the  servants.\"    \"Ah!\" said Iachimo, \"but she gave me this bracelet. She took it from  her arm. I see her yet. Her pretty action did outsell her gift, and yet  enriched it too. She gave it me, and said she prized it once.\"    \"Take the ring,\" cried Leonatus, \"you have won; and you might have  won my life as well, for I care nothing for it now I know my lady has  forgotten me.\"    And mad with anger, he wrote letters to Britain to his old servant,  Pisanio, ordering him to take Imogen to Milford Haven, and to murder  her, because she had forgotten him and given away his gift. At the same  time he wrote to Imogen herself, telling her to go with Pisanio, his old  servant, to Milford Haven, and that he, her husband, would be there to  meet her.    Now when Pisanio got this letter he was too good to carry out its  orders, and too wise to let them alone altogether. So he gave Imogen the  letter from her husband, and started with her for Milford Haven. Before  he left, the wicked Queen gave him a drink which, she said, would be  useful in sickness. She hoped he would give it to Imogen, and that  Imogen would die, and the wicked Queen's son could be King. For the  Queen thought this drink was a poison, but really and truly it was only  a sleeping-draft.    When Pisanio and Imogen came near to Milford Haven, he told her what was  really in the letter he had had from her husband.    \"I must go on to Rome, and see him myself,\" said Imogen.    And then Pisanio helped her to dress in boy's clothes, and sent her  on her way, and went back to the Court. Before he went he gave her the  drink he had had from the Queen.    Imogen went on, getting more and more tired, and at last came to a cave.  Someone seemed to live there, but no one was in just then. So she went  in, and as she was almost dying of hunger, she took some food she saw  there, and had just done so, when an old man and two boys came into the  cave. She was very much frightened when she saw them, for she thought  that they would be angry with her for taking their food, though she  had meant to leave money for it on the table. But to her surprise they  welcomed her kindly. She looked very pretty in her boy's clothes and her  face was good, as well as pretty.    \"You shall be our brother,\" said both the boys; and so she stayed with  them, and helped to cook the food, and make things comfortable. But one  day when the old man, whose name was Bellarius, was out hunting with  the two boys, Imogen felt ill, and thought she would try the medicine  Pisanio had given her. So she took it, and at once became like a dead  creature, so that when Bellarius and the boys came back from hunting,  they thought she was dead, and with many tears and funeral songs, they  carried her away and laid her in the wood, covered with flowers.    They sang sweet songs to her, and strewed flowers"]]]
