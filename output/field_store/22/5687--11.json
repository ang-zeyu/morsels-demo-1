The  intrigue continued secret, until Yayati had two sons by Devayani and  three by Sermishtha, when it was discovered by the former, and excited  her resentment as well as that of her father. The violation of the  king's promise was punished by premature decay, as denounced upon him by  Sukra, with permission, however, to transfer his infirmities to anyone  who would acccept them. Yayati appealed to his sons; of whom the  youngest alone, Puru, consented to assume the burden. After a sufficient  period, Yayati took his decrepitude back again, and left the  sovereignty to Puru in reward of his filial piety.    All the sons of Yayati were the founders of distinguished families. The  Pauravas were the descendants of Puru in whose line the Kaurava and the  Pandava families were comprised.          KAUTUKA SERVASWA.      Kalivatsala, or the darling of the age of iniquity, is the sovereign of  Dhermanasa or the destruction of virtue, and he takes as his spiritual  guide, Kukermapanchanana, the Siva of iniquity.    Satyacharya, a pious Brahman returned from Brindavan, who is treated by  the king and his courtiers with great iniquity, holds the following  conversation with his brethren in jail.    Satyacharya says: \"How now, holy sirs, how fares it with you?\"    The Brahmans in jail reply: \"We once had lands in free gifts.\"    Satyacharya asks, \"What then?\"    The Brahmans answer: \"why, know you not the customs of the country? If  the god of wealth owned lands here that yielded but a grain of corn, the  king would send him in three days to beg alms, clad in tatters and with  a platter in his hand. The characteristics of our sovereign are fondness  for the intoxicating juice of _bhang_, esteem for the wicked, addiction  to vice, and detestation of virtue.\"    Satyacharya observes: \"You are right, what chance is there for the good?  The king is unwise, his associates are wicked, his chief councillor is a  knave, and his minister, a scoundrel. Yet the people are many; why is  not such misconduct resented?\"    The Brahmans reply, \"The manners of the people are equally depraved;  they are valiant in oppression, skilful in falsehood, and persevering  only in contempt for the pious.\"    Satyacharya asks, \"How are the scribes?\"    The Brahmans answer, \"They collect the revenues by any expedient, and  vigilantly inflict penalties on the wise. The Brahmans are not allowed  to keep even the dust upon their bodies; the dust accumulated on their  feet is claimed by the Kayeths. What can we say of this reign? The dumb  alone can speak the truth, the deaf hear the law, the sons of the barren  are well-behaved, the blind behold the observance of the scriptures. Our  lands have been given to drunkards, and we are detained in prison for  what our ancestors expended.\"    Satyacharya observes, \"I have heard enough. Better fortunes attend you.\"    The general Samara Jambuka, the jackal of war, boasts that he can cleave  a roll of butter with his falchion. He trembles from top to toe at the  approach of a mosquito.    The king orders vice to be proclaimed virtue by beat of drum. All the  Brahmans are perpetually banished.          PRACHANDA PANDAVA    OR    THE OFFENDED SONS OF PANDU    OR    BALA BHARATA.      Draupadi is married to the five sons of Pandu, in compliance with the  command of their mother. Yudhishthira, the eldest son of Pandu, loses  every thing including Draupadi at chess-play with Duryodhana, the eldest  of the Kauravas. Draupadi is now dragged by the hair, almost naked, into  the public assembly, an insult in revenge for which ferocious Bhima vows  to slay Duhsasana, the insulter, and drink his blood, and ultimately  fulfils his vow. The Pandava princes then depart to the forest.          PROBODHA CHANDRODAYA    OR    \"RISE OF THE MOON OF (TRUE) KNOWLEDGE.\"      Religion and the noble king Reason, accompanied by all the Virtues  namely Faith, Volition, Opinion, Imagination, Contemplation, Devotion,  Quietude, Friendship and others, are banished, from Benares, by the evil  king Error who reigns at Benares, surrounded by his faithful adherents,  the Follies and Vices namely Self-conceit, Hypocrisy, Love, Passion,  Anger, Avarice and others. There is, however, a prophecy that Reason  will some day be re-united with Revelation; the fruit of the union will  be True Knowledge, that will destroy the reign of Error.    The struggle for this union and its consummation are followed by the  final triumph of the good party.          NAGANANDA    OR    JOY OF THE SERPENTS.      Jimutavahana, a prince of the Vidyadharas, is a Buddhist. He marries  Malayavati, daughter of the king of the Siddhas, a votary of the goddess  Gauri, the wife of the great god Siva. When he comes to know that  Garuda, the bird celebrated in mythology, is used to eat up one snake  each day, he makes up his mind to offer himself to the bird as a victim,  and eventually succeeds in converting Garuda to the principle of  _Ahimsa_ or abstention from slaughter; but he himself is on the point of  succumbing to the wounds he has received, when, through the timely  intervention of the goddess Gouri, he recovers.          DUTANGADA    OR    THE MISSION OF ANGADA.      Angada, the son of Bali, is sent by Rama to Ravana to demand Sita. He  executes his mission in a most clever and courageous manner. He then  departs from Lanka. Ravana now goes forth to battle and is slain by  Rama. The divine hero then enters the city of Lanka in triumph.          PRADYUMNA VIJAYA.      A pair of geese, the _Hansa_ and _Hansi_ inspire Prabhavati, the  daughter of Vajranabha, and Pradyumna, the son of Krishna with a mutual  passion before they have beheld each other. By their contrivance, secret  nuptials are brought about.    The sage Nareda communicates the stolen interviews of the lovers to the  father of the damsel, to whose vengeance Pradyumna is about to fall a  victim, when Krishna and Baladeva with their followers come to the  rescue. A combat ensues in which Vajranabha is defeated and slain. The  engagement is seen by two Gandherbas from their chariots in the air.          VIDAGDHA MADHAVA.      The loves of Krishna and Radha are intense. The two lovers often engage  in jealous squabbles.    Chandravali, a nymph of Vrindavan, is enamoured of Krishna and thus  excites the jealousy of Radha.    The Paurnamasi, the personified day of the full moon, interests herself  in the union of Krishna and Radha.          DHANANYAYA VIJAYA.      The cattle of king Virat are carried off by Karna and the Kuru princes.  Aryuna recovers them after a great battle. The different chiefs appear,  threaten one another and praise themselves.    Indra and some of his attendants contemplate the fight from the clouds.          HASYARNAVA.      The king Anasayindhu, in his progress through his city, regrets to find  everything subverted: that Chandals, not Brahmans, make shoes; that  wives are chaste and husbands constant; and that respect is paid to the  respectable, not to the vile; and that Vyadhisindhu, the doctor, cures  the cholic by applying a heated needle to the palate, and perforates the  pupils of the eyes in order to restore vision.    Sadhhinsaka, the chief of police, reports with great satisfaction that  the city is completely in the hands of thieves; the Commander-in-chief  Ranajambuka, after putting on his armour, valiantly cuts a leech in two.  Mahayatrika, the astrologer, in answer to a question of the time to take  a journey, indicates hours and positions which proclaim approaching  death.    A dispute ensues between Viswabhanda, a Saiva mendicant, and  Kalahankura, his disciple, which they refer to the decision of  Mahanindaka, another Brahman, who asserts that he composed the _vedas_  and visited _Swerga_, where he treated Vrihaspati and Brahma with  contempt and gave Siva a drubbing.          CHITRA YAJNA.      Daksha, the father of Sati or Bhavani and father-in-law of the great god  Siva, institutes a great sacrifice.    The gods and sages assemble on the occasion, Daksha accords them a  cordial reception. He bows down to the feet of the gods, and puts the  dust from under them upon his head. He then proceeds to the place of  sacrifice, reading or reciting the usual formulae. He orders the  attendants to distribute rice to the Brahmans, for the purpose of  invoking their benedictions. They receive the rice, scatter it and  pronounce the _Swasti Vachana_, or benedictory text. He offers oblation  to fire.    Dadhichi now comes to the sacrifice, when a dispute ensues between him  and the sacrificer, upon the impropriety of omitting to invite Siva; and  the dispute becoming rather hot, Daksha orders his guest to be turned  out. The gods partake of Dadhichi's indignation at the disrespectful  mention of Siva, and rise to depart. Daksha orders his servants to guard  the door and prevent their going forth: the gods, however, force their  way.    The sages then also withdraw, on which Daksha goes out, exclaiming, \"I  will give double presents to those who remain.\" Nareda goes to Kailas  with the news. He enters playing the _Vina_ and singing hymns in honour  of the great god. Nareda's communication to Siva and Bhavani is very  brief.    Siva asks, \"Now, Nareda, whence come you?\" Nareda replies, \"Your godship  is omniscient, you know all that has happened, but have asked me through  a wish to hear it from my lips. We were all invited to Daksha's  sacrifice. Dadhichi, finding that you were not invited, took Daksha to  task pretty sharply, and walked off, upon which I come to pay you my  respects.\" Having said this and prostrated himself on the ground, the  sage, with his lute hanging upon his neck, departed.    Sati now asks leave to go and see her father.    Siva replies, \"It is quite contrary to etiquette, to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18297"],[0,"The Story of a Summer (#13)"],[1,", Mr. Murray's elegant grounds.    The drive was a very pretty one, skirting for some distance the  beautiful little lake that supplies the great thirsty city of New York;  and the spot chosen for the picnic--shady, terrace-like heights, with a  gradual slope to meet the water, and a rough bench here and there--was  declared the most suitable place in the world to lay the cloth.  One or  two members of the party remained behind to unload the carriages, count  the broken dishes, and estimate the proportion of contributions--many  people fetching salt in abundance but forgetting sugar, whilst others  furnished elaborately frosted cakes, but omitted such necessaries as  knives and forks.  Meantime, we climbed the stone steps leading to the  waterworks, and after a glimpse of the seething dark-green water  through the heavy iron grating, we hunted up the overseer and asked him  to unlock the doors for us, that we might have a nearer view.  He  assented, and admitted us very obligingly, giving us meantime a graphic  description of the yearly journey of the Inspector in a boat down the  dark passage to New York, and pointing out the low narrow place of  entry from the water-house where they must lie down in the boat.    Dinner hour is generally a most interesting moment in a picnic, and  this was the time when the young gentlemen showed their gallantry by  partaking only of such viands as had come from the baskets of their  favorites among the young ladies.    A cloth was spread upon the ground; seats were extemporized for the  ladies out of carriage cushions, waterproofs and wraps; the knives,  forks and plates were dealt out as impartially as possible, and we  passed a very merry hour.    When the repast was over, the party dispersed--some to play croquet,  others to row upon the lake, or to stroll about under the trees; some  young ladies produced books and bright bits of fancy-work, while  Gabrielle, Arthur and I, with our pretty captain, Miss Murray, and one  of her attendant cavaliers, decided to pass away the time by playing a  game--no trivial game, however; neither \"consequences\" nor  fortune-telling, but an eminently scientific one entitled \"Twenty  Questions.\"  For the benefit of the uninitiated I will remark that the  oracle chooses a subject (silently), and the others are allowed to put  twenty questions to him to enable them to divine it--usually commencing  with \"Is the object that you have in your mind to be found in the  animal, vegetable, or mineral kingdom?\"    Gabrielle is very clever in this somewhat abstruse game, for she  possesses her mother's spirit of inquiry and love of reasoning, and she  passes entire evenings with Arthur, pursuing the most perplexing and  intangible subjects.  She and Arthur are admirably matched in this  game; for if she is unparalleled in the quickness with which she will  follow up a clue and triumphantly announce the mysterious object, after  asking eighteen or nineteen questions, Arthur is no less adroit in  selecting unusual subjects, and so artfully parrying her questions as  to give her the least possible assistance.  I often hear them call to  each other--    \"I have chosen a subject; you will never in the world guess it!\"    Then follows an hour of questions and reasoning, with inferences drawn  and rejected, and a display of sophistry that would do credit to a more  fully fledged lawyer than Arthur is at present.    Yesterday, after dinner, they launched into one of their games, and  Gabrielle guessed after eighteen questions what would have required  forty, I am sure, from any one else--the eighty-eighth eye of a fly!    Another was even more puzzling.  The object belonged, Arthur assured  her, to the vegetable kingdom, the color was white, and he had often  met it within a dozen yards of the railway station.  \"A daisy,\" was the  first and natural solution, but she was, he assured her, very far  adrift.  \"A telegraph post,\" she next announced, but she was again  unsuccessful.  At this point I left them; but after an hour had passed  Gabrielle ran up to my room to tell me that she had guessed it--a polka  dot upon one of her morning dresses!    The object chosen by Arthur at the picnic was the right horn of the  moon.  Gabrielle, this time, sat beside me and enjoyed the perplexity  of the questioners, for not until we were about to step into the  carriage to return home did they guess it.      _June 27_.    A letter this morning from our pretty cousin Evangeline, announcing  that she is engaged to a Dr. Ross of Chautauqua county, where she  lives.  Evangeline is the only daughter of mamma's youngest sister,  Margaret.  She is eighteen years old, of medium height, and well  formed, with a fair complexion, the chestnut hair that is peculiar to  the younger members of the Greeley family, and brown eyes inherited  from her father's family, for the Greeley eye _par excellence_ is blue.  Although Evangeline has been brought up in the quiet little village of  Clymer, she has been well educated, and besides being uncle's favorite  among his nieces, she was much admired in general society during the  winter that she spent with us in New York two years ago.  At uncle's  birthday party, which she attended, she was by many pronounced the  handsomest young lady present.    We have never seen Dr. Ross, but mamma remembers his family well, and  says that \"he comes of a good stock.\"  He is not wealthy, but he is in  a good profession, is of unexceptionable character, and very devoted to  our dear Evangeline; so they have _my_ blessing.  The marriage will not  take place until December, when Evangeline will have laid off her  mourning.    Marguerite's portfolio is open upon her writing-table, and a letter to  Evangeline, not yet sealed, lies between the blotting-sheets.  As it  speaks of Evangeline's betrothal, I will insert it here:      \"CHAPPAQUA, _June 27_.    \"DEAREST EVANGELINE:--You complain in your last letter that I do not  write enough about Chappaqua and 'the farm.'  You wish particulars.  My  sweet cousin, I thought that you were familiar with descriptions of  this dearest spot on earth, as I remember that dear uncle gave each of  us a copy of his 'Recollections' the last Christmas that you were with  us--the last Christmas indeed that he spent upon this earth.  Peruse  that volume, dear, for in it you will find a more vivid picture, a more  poetic description of his dearly loved home and surroundings, than  anything that I can say.    \"As to Chappaqua being a large or small village--it is small, very  small, not half so large as Clymer, where you live; but it is far more  picturesque.  There are only a dozen or two houses in all, including a  couple of stores, a post-office, a 'wayside inn,' and a church without  a bell.  There are, however, many fine residences scattered over the  township; whichever way we drive, we see elegant mansions nestling in a  copse of wood, or crowning some hill-top.    \"The valley through which we approach Chappaqua is faced on either side  by a succession of beautiful undulating hills that are thickly covered  with dark-green foliage.  This farm, consisting of eighty-four acres  (for you know that there is another lying adjacent of nearly the same  size), presents very beautiful and varied scenery.  Near the house in  the woods, where uncle and aunt lived so many years, a pretty brook  winds down by the lower barn, and goes singing away through the meadows  bright      \"'With steadfast daisies pure and white.'    But this is not all; this lovely, babbling brook fills a large pond,  high up in the woods, then flows over a stone dam, and comes rushing  down in a succession of waterfalls, stopping for breathing-space in one  of the wildest story-telling glens I ever saw.    \"And here, in the gloom of the forest-trees, where the birds love to  congregate, and a thousand perfumes of clover and new-mown hay, and the  aroma of the evergreen grove, come up, Ida and I spend many an hour,  forgetful of city life, and heedless about ever returning to it.    \"This year we are occupying the roadside house, which, although not so  beautiful as the new one on the side-hill, nor so retired and romantic  as the one in the woods still is lovely and has a very charming  prospect.  It stands on sloping ground that is skirted by forest and  fruit trees.  Some of them throw their grateful shade on the piazza and  balcony that run the width of the front of the house.  My room opens on  the balcony by three French windows, and here I often walk to catch the  last gleam of departing day, or linger after nightfall to see the  far-away stars come out.  The moonrise here is perfectly enchanting,  climbing up as it does over the eastern hills, and throwing its pensive  light over the silent meadows, and distant, dark woods.    \"But I have filled my sheet before speaking of your engagement.  As I  have not seen your handsome doctor, you will not expect me to be  enthusiastic.  I hear that he is intelligent, clever in his profession,  and of excellent character, but not rich.  Well Evangeline, you know I  approve of wealth, combined with other good qualifications; but if I  had to choose between a man of mind and a man of money, I don't think I  would hesitate long which to take; so you are sure of my approbation,  and you have my best wishes for your future happiness.    \"Your loving cousin,    \"MARGUERITE.\"      _June 29_.    A visit yesterday from our friend Mrs. Sarah L. Hopper, the clever  contributor to several Southern journals.  Among them the _Washington  Gazette_, and the _True Woman_--the latter an anti-suffrage journal.  Mrs. Hopper not only writes well; she is also a woman of varied and  excellent reading, and the appreciation of the modern classics is  displayed in one of her poems--an admirable apostrophe to the character  and works of Dante.  This poem, which was published some time since,  Mrs. Hopper once recited to us, and both mamma and I"]]]
