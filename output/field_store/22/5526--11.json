I told him his wish  was unnecessary, for I would leave him that instant; and so, taking my  hat, walk'd out of doors, desiring Meredith, whom I saw below, to take  care of some things I left, and bring them to my lodgings.    Meredith came accordingly in the evening, when we talked my affair  over.  He had conceiv'd a great regard for me, and was very unwilling  that I should leave the house while he remain'd in it.  He dissuaded me  from returning to my native country, which I began to think of; he  reminded me that Keimer was in debt for all he possess'd; that his  creditors began to be uneasy; that he kept his shop miserably, sold  often without profit for ready money, and often trusted without keeping  accounts; that he must therefore fall, which would make a vacancy I  might profit of.  I objected my want of money.  He then let me know  that his father had a high opinion of me, and, from some discourse that  had pass'd between them, he was sure would advance money to set us up,  if I would enter into partnership with him.  \"My time,\" says he, \"will  be out with Keimer in the spring; by that time we may have our press  and types in from London.  I am sensible I am no workman; if you like  it, your skill in the business shall be set against the stock I  furnish, and we will share the profits equally.\"    The proposal was agreeable, and I consented; his father was in town and  approv'd of it; the more as he saw I had great influence with his son,  had prevail'd on him to abstain long from dram-drinking, and he hop'd  might break him off that wretched habit entirely, when we came to be so  closely connected.  I gave an inventory to the father, who carry'd it  to a merchant; the things were sent for, the secret was to be kept till  they should arrive, and in the mean time I was to get work, if I could,  at the other printing-house. But I found no vacancy there, and so  remain'd idle a few days, when Keimer, on a prospect of being employ'd  to print some paper money in New Jersey, which would require cuts and  various types that I only could supply, and apprehending Bradford might  engage me and get the jobb from him, sent me a very civil message, that  old friends should not part for a few words, the effect of sudden  passion, and wishing me to return.  Meredith persuaded me to comply, as  it would give more opportunity for his improvement under my daily  instructions; so I return'd, and we went on more smoothly than for some  time before.  The New Jersey jobb was obtain'd, I contriv'd a  copperplate press for it, the first that had been seen in the country;  I cut several ornaments and checks for the bills.  We went together to  Burlington, where I executed the whole to satisfaction; and he received  so large a sum for the work as to be enabled thereby to keep his head  much longer above water.    At Burlington I made an acquaintance with many principal people of the  province.  Several of them had been appointed by the Assembly a  committee to attend the press, and take care that no more bills were  printed than the law directed.  They were therefore, by turns,  constantly with us, and generally he who attended, brought with him a  friend or two for company.  My mind having been much more improv'd by  reading than Keimer's, I suppose it was for that reason my conversation  seem'd to be more valu'd. They had me to their houses, introduced me to  their friends, and show'd me much civility; while he, tho' the master,  was a little neglected.  In truth, he was an odd fish; ignorant of  common life, fond of rudely opposing receiv'd opinions, slovenly to  extream dirtiness, enthusiastic in some points of religion, and a  little knavish withal.    We continu'd there near three months; and by that time I could reckon  among my acquired friends, Judge Allen, Samuel Bustill, the secretary  of the Province, Isaac Pearson, Joseph Cooper, and several of the  Smiths, members of Assembly, and Isaac Decow, the surveyor-general. The  latter was a shrewd, sagacious old man, who told me that he began for  himself, when young, by wheeling clay for the brick-makers, learned to  write after he was of age, carri'd the chain for surveyors, who taught  him surveying, and he had now by his industry, acquir'd a good estate;  and says he, \"I foresee that you will soon work this man out of  business, and make a fortune in it at Philadelphia.\"  He had not then  the least intimation of my intention to set up there or anywhere.  These friends were afterwards of great use to me, as I occasionally was  to some of them.  They all continued their regard for me as long as  they lived.    Before I enter upon my public appearance in business, it may be well to  let you know the then state of my mind with regard to my principles and  morals, that you may see how far those influenc'd the future events of  my life.  My parents had early given me religious impressions, and  brought me through my childhood piously in the Dissenting way.  But I  was scarce fifteen, when, after doubting by turns of several points, as  I found them disputed in the different books I read, I began to doubt  of Revelation itself.  Some books against Deism fell into my hands;  they were said to be the substance of sermons preached at Boyle's  Lectures.  It happened that they wrought an effect on me quite contrary  to what was intended by them; for the arguments of the Deists, which  were quoted to be refuted, appeared to me much stronger than the  refutations; in short, I soon became a thorough Deist.  My arguments  perverted some others, particularly Collins and Ralph; but, each of  them having afterwards wrong'd me greatly without the least  compunction, and recollecting Keith's conduct towards me (who was  another freethinker), and my own towards Vernon and Miss Read, which at  times gave me great trouble, I began to suspect that this doctrine,  tho' it might be true, was not very useful.  My London pamphlet, which  had for its motto these lines of Dryden:              \"Whatever is, is right.  Though purblind man            Sees but a part o' the chain, the nearest link:            His eyes not carrying to the equal beam,            That poises all above;\"    and from the attributes of God, his infinite wisdom, goodness and  power, concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the world, and  that vice and virtue were empty distinctions, no such things existing,  appear'd now not so clever a performance as I once thought it; and I  doubted whether some error had not insinuated itself unperceiv'd into  my argument, so as to infect all that follow'd, as is common in  metaphysical reasonings.    I grew convinc'd that truth, sincerity and integrity in dealings  between man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of  life; and I form'd written resolutions, which still remain in my  journal book, to practice them ever while I lived.  Revelation had  indeed no weight with me, as such; but I entertain'd an opinion that,  though certain actions might not be bad because they were forbidden by  it, or good because it commanded them, yet probably these actions might  be forbidden because they were bad for us, or commanded because they  were beneficial to us, in their own natures, all the circumstances of  things considered.  And this persuasion, with the kind hand of  Providence, or some guardian angel, or accidental favorable  circumstances and situations, or all together, preserved me, thro' this  dangerous time of youth, and the hazardous situations I was sometimes  in among strangers, remote from the eye and advice of my father,  without any willful gross immorality or injustice, that might have been  expected from my want of religion.  I say willful, because the  instances I have mentioned had something of necessity in them, from my  youth, inexperience, and the knavery of others.  I had therefore a  tolerable character to begin the world with; I valued it properly, and  determin'd to preserve it.    We had not been long return'd to Philadelphia before the new types  arriv'd from London.  We settled with Keimer, and left him by his  consent before he heard of it.  We found a house to hire near the  market, and took it.  To lessen the rent, which was then but  twenty-four pounds a year, tho' I have since known it to let for  seventy, we took in Thomas Godfrey, a glazier, and his family, who were  to pay a considerable part of it to us, and we to board with them.  We  had scarce opened our letters and put our press in order, before George  House, an acquaintance of mine, brought a countryman to us, whom he had  met in the street inquiring for a printer.  All our cash was now  expended in the variety of particulars we had been obliged to procure,  and this countryman's five shillings, being our first-fruits, and  coming so seasonably, gave me more pleasure than any crown I have since  earned; and the gratitude I felt toward House has made me often more  ready than perhaps I should otherwise have been to assist young  beginners.    There are croakers in every country, always boding its ruin.  Such a  one then lived in Philadelphia; a person of note, an elderly man, with  a wise look and a very grave manner of speaking; his name was Samuel  Mickle.  This gentleman, a stranger to me, stopt one day at my door,  and asked me if I was the young man who had lately opened a new  printing-house. Being answered in the affirmative, he said he was sorry  for me, because it was an expensive undertaking, and the expense would  be lost; for Philadelphia was a sinking place, the people already  half-bankrupts, or near being so; all appearances to the contrary, such  as new buildings and the rise of rents, being to his certain knowledge  fallacious; for they were, in fact, among the things that would soon  ruin us.  And he gave me such a detail of misfortunes now existing, or  that were soon to exist, that he left me half melancholy.  Had I known  him before I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1480"],[0,"Tom Brown's School Days (#13)"],[1,"-sack over his knees. The darkness has driven him inwards, and he  has gone over his little past life, and thought of all his doings and  promises, and of his mother and sister, and his father's last words; and  has made fifty good resolutions, and means to bear himself like a brave  Brown as he is, though a young one. Then he has been forward into the  mysterious boy-future, speculating as to what sort of place Rugby is,  and what they do there, and calling up all the stories of public schools  which he has heard from big boys in the holidays. He is choke-full of  hope and life, notwithstanding the cold, and kicks his heels against the  back-board, and would like to sing, only he doesn't know how his friend  the silent guard might take it.    And now the dawn breaks at the end of the fourth stage, and the coach  pulls up at a little roadside inn with huge stables behind. There is a  bright fire gleaming through the red curtains of the bar window, and  the door is open. The coachman catches his whip into a double thong, and  throws it to the hostler; the steam of the horses rises straight up  into the air. He has put them along over the last two miles, and is two  minutes before his time. He rolls down from the box and into the inn.  The guard rolls off behind. \"Now, sir,\" says he to Tom, \"you just jump  down, and I'll give you a drop of something to keep the cold out.\"    Tom finds a difficulty in jumping, or indeed in finding the top of the  wheel with his feet, which may be in the next world for all he feels;  so the guard picks him off the coach top, and sets him on his legs, and  they stump off into the bar, and join the coachman and the other outside  passengers.    Here a fresh-looking barmaid serves them each with a glass of early purl  as they stand before the fire, coachman and guard exchanging business  remarks. The purl warms the cockles of Tom's heart, and makes him cough.    \"Rare tackle that, sir, of a cold morning,\" says the coachman, smiling.  \"Time's up.\" They are out again and up; coachee the last, gathering the  reins into his hands and talking to Jem the hostler about the mare's  shoulder, and then swinging himself up on to the box--the horses dashing  off in a canter before he falls into his seat. Toot-toot-tootle-too goes  the horn, and away they are again, five-and-thirty miles on their road  (nearly half-way to Rugby, thinks Tom), and the prospect of breakfast at  the end of the stage.    And now they begin to see, and the early life of the country-side comes  out--a market cart or two; men in smock-frocks going to their work, pipe  in mouth, a whiff of which is no bad smell this bright morning. The sun  gets up, and the mist shines like silver gauze. They pass the hounds  jogging along to a distant meet, at the heels of the huntsman's back,  whose face is about the colour of the tails of his old pink, as he  exchanges greetings with coachman and guard. Now they pull up at a  lodge, and take on board a well-muffled-up sportsman, with his gun-case  and carpet-bag, An early up-coach meets them, and the coachmen gather  up their horses, and pass one another with the accustomed lift of the  elbow, each team doing eleven miles an hour, with a mile to spare behind  if necessary. And here comes breakfast.    \"Twenty minutes here, gentlemen,\" says the coachman, as they pull up at  half-past seven at the inn-door.    Have we not endured nobly this morning? and is not this a worthy reward  for much endurance? There is the low, dark wainscoted room hung with  sporting prints; the hat-stand (with a whip or two standing up in it  belonging to bagmen who are still snug in bed) by the door; the blazing  fire, with the quaint old glass over the mantelpiece, in which is stuck  a large card with the list of the meets for the week of the county  hounds; the table covered with the whitest of cloths and of china, and  bearing a pigeon-pie, ham, round of cold boiled beef cut from a mammoth  ox, and the great loaf of household bread on a wooden trencher. And  here comes in the stout head waiter, puffing under a tray of hot  viands--kidneys and a steak, transparent rashers and poached eggs,  buttered toast and muffins, coffee and tea, all smoking hot. The table  can never hold it all. The cold meats are removed to the sideboard--they  were only put on for show and to give us an appetite. And now fall on,  gentlemen all. It is a well-known sporting-house, and the breakfasts are  famous. Two or three men in pink, on their way to the meet, drop in, and  are very jovial and sharp-set, as indeed we all are.    \"Tea or coffee, sir?\" says head waiter, coming round to Tom.    \"Coffee, please,\" says Tom, with his mouth full of muffin and kidney.  Coffee is a treat to him, tea is not.    Our coachman, I perceive, who breakfasts with us, is a cold beef man.  He also eschews hot potations, and addicts himself to a tankard of ale,  which is brought him by the barmaid. Sportsman looks on approvingly, and  orders a ditto for himself.    Tom has eaten kidney and pigeon-pie, and imbibed coffee, till his little  skin is as tight as a drum; and then has the further pleasure of paying  head waiter out of his own purse, in a dignified manner, and walks out  before the inn-door to see the horses put to. This is done leisurely and  in a highly-finished manner by the hostlers, as if they enjoyed the not  being hurried. Coachman comes out with his waybill, and puffing a fat  cigar which the sportsman has given him. Guard emerges from the tap,  where he prefers breakfasting, licking round a tough-looking doubtful  cheroot, which you might tie round your finger, and three whiffs of  which would knock any one else out of time.    The pinks stand about the inn-door lighting cigars and waiting to see us  start, while their hacks are led up and down the market-place, on which  the inn looks. They all know our sportsman, and we feel a reflected  credit when we see him chatting and laughing with them.    \"Now, sir, please,\" says the coachman. All the rest of the passengers  are up; the guard is locking up the hind-boot.    \"A good run to you!\" says the sportsman to the pinks, and is by the  coachman's side in no time.    \"Let 'em go, Dick!\" The hostlers fly back, drawing off the cloths from  their glossy loins, and away we go through the market-place and down the  High Street, looking in at the first-floor windows, and seeing several  worthy burgesses shaving thereat; while all the shopboys who are  cleaning the windows, and housemaids who are doing the steps, stop and  look pleased as we rattle past, as if we were a part of their legitimate  morning's amusement. We clear the town, and are well out between the  hedgerows again as the town clock strikes eight.    The sun shines almost warmly, and breakfast has oiled all springs  and loosened all tongues. Tom is encouraged by a remark or two of the  guard's between the puffs of his oily cheroot, and besides is getting  tired of not talking. He is too full of his destination to talk about  anything else, and so asks the guard if he knows Rugby.    \"Goes through it every day of my life. Twenty minutes afore twelve  down--ten o'clock up.\"    \"What sort of place is it, please?\" says Tom.    Guard looks at him with a comical expression. \"Werry out-o'-the-way  place, sir; no paving to streets, nor no lighting. 'Mazin' big horse and  cattle fair in autumn--lasts a week--just over now. Takes town a week to  get clean after it. Fairish hunting country. But slow place, sir, slow  place--off the main road, you see--only three coaches a day, and one on  'em a two-oss wan, more like a hearse nor a coach--Regulator--comes from  Oxford. Young genl'm'n at school calls her Pig and Whistle, and goes up  to college by her (six miles an hour) when they goes to enter. Belong to  school, sir?\"    \"Yes,\" says Tom, not unwilling for a moment that the guard should think  him an old boy. But then, having some qualms as to the truth of the  assertion, and seeing that if he were to assume the character of an old  boy he couldn't go on asking the questions he wanted, added--\"That is to  say, I'm on my way there. I'm a new boy.\"    The guard looked as if he knew this quite as well as Tom.    \"You're werry late, sir,\" says the guard; \"only six weeks to-day to the  end of the half.\" Tom assented. \"We takes up fine loads this day six  weeks, and Monday and Tuesday arter. Hopes we shall have the pleasure of  carrying you back.\"    Tom said he hoped they would; but he thought within himself that his  fate would probably be the Pig and Whistle.    \"It pays uncommon cert'nly,\" continues the guard. \"Werry free with their  cash is the young genl'm'n. But, Lor' bless you, we gets into such rows  all 'long the road, what wi' their pea-shooters, and long whips, and  hollering, and upsetting every one as comes by, I'd a sight sooner  carry one or two on 'em, sir, as I may be a-carryin' of you now, than a  coach-load.\"    \"What do they do with the pea-shooters?\" inquires Tom.    \"Do wi' 'em! Why, peppers every one's faces as we comes near, 'cept the  young gals, and breaks windows wi' them too, some on 'em shoots so hard.  Now 'twas just here last June, as we was a-driving up the first-day  boys, they was mendin' a quarter-mile of road, and there was a lot of  Irish chaps, reg'lar roughs, a-breaking stones. As we comes up, 'Now,  boys,' says young gent on the box (smart young fellow and desper't  reckless), 'here's fun! Let the Pats have it about the ears.' 'God's  sake sir!' says Bob (that's my mate the coachman); 'don't go for to  shoot at 'em. They'll knock us off the coach.' 'Damme, coachee,' says  young my lord, 'you ain't afraid.--Hoora, boys! let 'em have it.'  'Hoora!' sings out the others, and fill their mouths choke-full of peas  to last the whole line. Bob, seeing as 'twas to come, knocks his hat  over his eyes, hollers to his osses, and shakes 'em up; and away we goes  up to the line on 'em, twenty miles an hour. The Pats"]]]
