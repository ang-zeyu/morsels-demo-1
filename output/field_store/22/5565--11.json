Even a child, if he has this inherent quality, can play a  simple figure of five notes as fast as they need to be played. People of  the South--not on this side of the water--but of Spain and Italy, are  accustomed to move quickly; they gesticulate with their hands and are  full of life and energy. It is no trouble for them to think with  velocity. Two people will set out to walk to a given point; they may  both walk fast, according to their idea of that word, but one will  cover the ground much more quickly than the other. I think this idea of  a time unit is again a limiting idea. There can be _no_ fixed and fast  rule as to the tempo of a composition; we cannot be bound by such rules.  The main thing is: Do I understand the meaning and spirit of the  composition, and can I make these clear to others? Can I so project this  piece that the picture is alive? If so, the fact as to whether it is a  few shades slower or faster does not enter into the question at all.      OBTAINING POWER    \"Many players totally mistake in what power consists. They think they  must exert great strength in order to acquire sufficient power. Many  women students have this idea; they do not realize that power comes from  contrast. This is the secret of the effect of power. I do not mean to  say that we must not play with all the force we have at times; we even  have to pound and bang occasionally to produce the needed effects. This  only proves again that a tone may be beautiful, though in itself harsh,  if this harshness comes in the right time and place.    \"As with velocity so with power; there is _no_ fixed and infallible rule  in regard to it, for that would only be another limitation to the  feeling, the poetry, the emotion of the executant's _thought_. The  quality and degree of power are due to contrast, and the choice of the  degree to be used lies with the player's understanding of the content of  the piece and his ability to bring out this content and place it in all  its perfection and beauty before the listener. This is his opportunity  to bring out the higher, the spiritual meaning.\"          XIV    A VISIT TO RAOUL PUGNO    TRAINING THE CHILD      \"An audience has been arranged for you to-day, with M. Raoul Pugno; he  will await you at four o'clock, in his Paris studio.\" Thus wrote the  courteous representative of _Musical America_ in Paris.    It had been very difficult to make appointments with any of the famous  French musicians, owing to their being otherwise engaged, or out of the  city. I therefore welcomed this opportunity for meeting at least one of  the great pianists of France.    At the appointed hour that afternoon, we drove through the busy rue de  Clicy, and halted at the number which had been indicated. It proved to  be one of those unpromising French apartment buildings, which present,  to the passer-by, a stern facade of flat wall, broken by rows of  shuttered windows, which give no hint of what may be hidden behind them.  In this case we did not find the man we sought in the front portion of  the building, but were directed to cross a large, square court. The  house was built around this court, as was the custom in constructing the  older sort of dwellings.    At last we discovered the right door, which was opened by a neat  housekeeper.    \"M. Pugno is not here, he lives in the country,\" she said, in answer to  our inquiry. (How difficult these French musicians are to find; they  seem to be one and all \"in the country\"!)    \"But, madame, we have an appointment with M. Pugno; will you not be good  enough to see if he is not here after all?\"    She left us standing, but returned almost immediately with the message  that M. Pugno had only that moment entered his studio, to which she  would conduct us.    [Illustration: RAOUL PUGNO]    In another moment we had crossed the tiny foyer and were standing within  the artist's sanctuary. At first glance one felt as though in an  Oriental chamber of some Eastern monarch. Heavy gold and silver Turkish  embroideries hung over doors and windows. The walls were covered with  many rare paintings; rich _objets d'art_ were scattered about in  profusion; an open door led out into a pretty garden, where flowers  bloomed, and a fountain _dripped_ into its marble basin. A raised dais  at one side of the room held a divan, over which were draperies of  Oriental stuffs. On this divan, as on a throne, sat the great pianist we  had come to see. He made a stately and imposing figure as he sat there,  with his long silvery beard and his dignified bearing. Near him sat a  pretty young woman, whom we soon learned was Mlle. Nadia Boulanger, a  composer and musician of brilliant attainments.    \"I regret that I am unable to converse with you in English, as I speak  no language but my own,\" began M. Pugno, with a courteous wave of the  hand for us to be seated.    \"You wish to know some of my ideas on piano playing--or rather on  teaching. I believe a child can begin to study the piano at a very early  age, if he show any aptitude for it; indeed the sooner he begins the  better, for then he will get over some of the drudgery by the time he is  old enough to understand a little about music.      TRAINING THE CHILD    \"Great care must be taken with the health of the child who has some  talent for music, so that he shall not overdo in his piano study. After  all a robust physical condition is of the first importance, for without  it one can do little.    \"A child in good health can begin as early as five or six years. He must  be most judiciously trained from the start. As the ear is of such prime  importance in music, great attention should be paid to tone study--to  listening to and distinguishing the various sounds, and to singing them  if possible, in solfeggio.    \"At the outset a good hand position must be secured, with correct finger  movements. Then there must be a thorough drill in scales, arpeggios,  chords, and a variety of finger exercises, before any kind of pieces are  taken up. The young student in early years, is expected to play various  etudes, as well as the technic studies I have mentioned--Czerny, Cramer,  Clementi, and always Bach. In my position, as member of the faculty of  the Conservatoire, a great many students pass before me. If I personally  accept any pupils, they naturally must be talented and advanced, as I  cannot give my time to the children. Still it is interesting to see the  child-thought develop.\"    The conversation turned upon the charming studio with its lovely  garden--where absolute quiet could be secured in spite of the noise and  bustle of one of the busiest quarters of Paris. The studio itself, we  were told, had formerly belonged to the painter Decamps, and some of the  pictures and furnishings were once his. A fine portrait of Pugno, life  size, filling the whole space above the piano, claimed our attention. He  kindly rose, as we admired the painting, and sought a photograph copy.  When it was found--the last one he possessed--he presented it with his  compliments.    We spoke of Mlle. Boulanger's work in composition, a subject which  seemed deeply to interest M. Pugno.    \"Yes, she is writing an opera; in fact we are writing it together; the  text is from a story of d'Annunzio. I will jot down the title for you.\"    Taking a paper which I held in my hand, he wrote,    _\"La Ville Morte, 4 Acts de d'Annuncio; Musique de Nadia Boulanger et  Raoul Pugno\"_    \"You will certainly have it performed in America, when it is finished; I  will tell them so,\" I said.    The great pianist smiled blandly and accepted the suggestion with  evident satisfaction.    \"Yes, we will come to America and see the work performed, when it is  completed,\" he said.    With many expressions of appreciation we took our leave of the Oriental  studio and its distinguished occupants; and, as we regained the busy,  noisy rue de Clicy, we said to ourselves that we had just lived through  one of the most unique experiences of our stay in Paris.           *       *       *       *       *    (The above is the last interview ever taken from this great French  artist, who passed away a few months later.)           *       *       *       *       *    The following items concerning M. Pugno's manner of teaching and  personal traits, were given me by Mme. Germaine Schnitzer, the  accomplished French pianist and the master's most gifted pupil.    \"Pugno had played the piano almost from infancy, and in early youth had  taken several piano prizes. Later, however, he gave much more of his  time to the organ, to the seeming neglect of the former instrument. How  his serious attention was reverted to the piano happened in this wise.  It was announced that Edward Grieg, the noted Norwegian, was coming to  Paris. Pugno was one day looking over his piano Concerto which had  recently appeared. 'Why don't you play the work for the composer when  he comes?' asked a friend. 'I am no pianist,' objected Pugno. 'Why not?'  said his friend; 'you know enough about the piano, and there are still  four weeks in which to learn the Concerto.' Pugno took the advice,  practised up the work, played it in the concert given by Grieg, and  scored a success. He was then thirty-nine years of age. This appearance  was the beginning; other engagements and successes followed, and thus he  developed into one of the great pianists of France.    \"Pugno was a born pianist; he had a natural gift for technic, and  therefore never troubled himself much about teaching technical exercises  nor practising them. If the work of a pupil contained technical faults,  he made no remarks nor explanations, but simply closed the music book  and refused to listen any further. The pupil, of course, retired in  discomfiture. He was fond of playing along with the pupil (generally  with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1561"],[0,"Pagan and Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning (#13)"],[1,"urd-rattles (known  in ever so many parts of the world) in which he rattled dried seeds  or small pebbles with a most beguiling and rain-like insistence; or  sometimes, like the priests of Baal in the Bible, (2) he would cut  himself with knives till the blood fell upon the ground in great drops  suggestive of an oncoming thunder-shower. \"In Mexico the rain god was  propitiated with sacrifices of children. If the children wept and shed  abundant tears, they who carried them rejoiced, being convinced that  rain would also be abundant.\" (3) Sometimes he, the rain-maker, would  WHISTLE for the wind, or, like the Omaha Indians, flap his blankets for  the same purpose.     (1) See A. Lang, op. cit.: \"The muttering of the thunder is said  to be his voice calling to the rain to fall and make the grass grow up  green.\" Such are the very words of Umbara, the minstrel of the Tribe  (Australian).     (2) I Kings xviii.     (3) Quoted from Sahagun II, 2, 3 by A. Lang in Myth, Ritual and  Religion, vol. ii, p. 102.      In the ancient myth of Demeter and Persephone--which has been adopted by  so many peoples under so many forms--Demeter the Earth-mother loses her  daughter Persephone (who represents of course the Vegetation), carried  down into the underworld by the evil powers of Darkness and Winter.  And in Greece there was a yearly ceremonial and ritual of magic for the  purpose of restoring the lost one and bringing her back to the world  again. Women carried certain charms, \"fir-cones and snakes and unnamable  objects made of paste, to ensure fertility; there was a sacrifice of  pigs, who were thrown into a deep cleft of the earth, and their remains  afterwards collected and scattered as a charm over the fields.\"  (1) Fir-cones and snakes from their very forms were emblems of male  fertility; snakes, too, from their habit of gliding out of their own  skins with renewed brightness and color were suggestive of resurrection  and re-vivification; pigs and sows by their exceeding fruitfulness would  in their hour of sacrifice remind old mother Earth of what was expected  from her! Moreover, no doubt it had been observed that the scattering of  dead flesh over the ground or mixed with the seed, did bless the  ground to a greater fertility; and so by a strange mixture of primitive  observation with a certain child-like belief that by means of symbols  and suggestions Nature could be appealed to and induced to answer to the  desires and needs for her children this sort of ceremonial Magic arose.  It was not exactly Science, and it was not exactly Religion; but it was  a naive, and perhaps not altogether mistaken, sense of the bond between  Nature and Man.     (1) See Gilbert Murray's Four Stages of Greek Religion, p. 29.      For we can perceive that earliest man was not yet consciously  differentiated from Nature. Not only do we see that the tribal life was  so strong that the individual seldom regarded himself as different or  separate or opposed to the rest of the tribe; but that something of the  same kind was true with regard to his relation to the Animals and to  Nature at large. This outer world was part of himself, was also himself.  His sub-conscious sense of unity was so great that it largely dominated  his life. That brain-cleverness and brain-activity which causes modern  man to perceive such a gulf between him and the animals, or between  himself and Nature, did not exist in the early man. Hence it was  no difficulty to him to believe that he was a Bear or an Emu.  Sub-consciously he was wiser than we are. He knew that he was a bear or  an emu, or any other such animal as his totem-creed led him to fix his  mind upon. Hence we find that a familiarity and common consent existed  between primitive man and many of his companion animals such as has  been lost or much attenuated in modern times. Elisee Reclus in his very  interesting paper La Grande Famille (1) gives support to the idea that  the so-called domestication of animals did not originally arise from any  forcible subjugation of them by man, but from a natural amity with  them which grew up in the beginning from common interests, pursuits and  affections. Thus the chetah of India (and probably the puma of Brazil)  from far-back times took to hunting in the company of his two-legged and  bow-and-arrow-armed friend, with whom he divided the spoil. W. H. Hudson  (2) declares that the Puma, wild and fierce though it is, and capable  of killing the largest game, will never even to-day attack man, but  when maltreated by the latter submits to the outrage, unresisting, with  mournful cries and every sign of grief. The Llama, though domesticated  in a sense, has never allowed the domination of the whip or the bit,  but may still be seen walking by the side of the Brazilian peasant  and carrying his burdens in a kind of proud companionship. The mutual  relations of Women and the Cow, or of Man and the Horse (3) (also the  Elephant) reach so far into the past that their origin cannot be traced.  The Swallow still loves to make its home under the cottage eaves and  still is welcomed by the inmates as the bringer of good fortune. Elisee  Reclus assures us that the Dinka man on the Nile calls to certain snakes  by name and shares with them the milk of his cows.       (1) Published originally in Le Magazine International, January  1896.     (2) See The Naturalist in La Plata, ch. ii.     (3) \"It is certain that the primitive Indo-European reared droves  of tame or half-tame horses for generations, if not centuries, before  it ever occurred to him to ride or drive them\" (F. B. Jevons, Introd. to  Hist. Religion, p. 119).      And so with Nature. The communal sense, or subconscious perception,  which made primitive men feel their unity with other members of their  tribe, and their obvious kinship with the animals around them, brought  them also so close to general Nature that they looked upon the trees,  the vegetation, the rain, the warmth of the sun, as part of their  bodies, part of themselves. Conscious differentiation had not yet set  in. To cause rain or thunder you had to make rain- or thunder-like  noises; to encourage Vegetation and the crops to leap out of the ground,  you had to leap and dance. \"In Swabia and among the Transylvanian Saxons  it is a common custom (says Dr. Frazer) for a man who has some hemp to  leap high in the field in the belief that this will make the hemp grow  tall.\" (1) Native May-pole dances and Jacks in the Green have hardly  yet died out--even in this most civilized England. The bower of green  boughs, the music of pipes, the leaping and the twirling, were all an  encouragement to the arrival of Spring, and an expression of Sympathetic  Magic. When you felt full of life and energy and virility in yourself  you naturally leapt and danced, so why should you not sympathetically do  this for the energizing of the crops? In every country of the world  the vernal season and the resurrection of the Sun has been greeted with  dances and the sound of music. But if you wanted success in hunting  or in warfare then you danced before-hand mimic dances suggesting the  successful hunt or battle. It was no more than our children do to-day,  and it all was, and is, part of a natural-magic tendency in human  thought.     (1) See The Golden Bough, i, 139 seq. Also Art and Ritual, p. 31.      Let me pause here for a moment. It is difficult for us with our  academical and somewhat school-boardy minds to enter into all this, and  to understand the sense of (unconscious or sub-conscious) identification  with the world around which characterized the primitive man--or to look  upon Nature with his eyes. A Tree, a Snake, a Bull, an Ear of Corn. WE  know so well from our botany and natural history books what these things  are. Why should our minds dwell on them any longer or harbor a doubt as  to our perfect comprehension of them?    And yet (one cannot help asking the question): Has any one of us really  ever SEEN a Tree? I certainly do not think that I have--except most  superficially. That very penetrating observer and naturalist, Henry D.  Thoreau, tells us that he would often make an appointment to visit a  certain tree, miles away--but what or whom he saw when he got there, he  does not say. Walt Whitman, also a keen observer, speaks of a tulip-tree  near which he sometimes sat--\"the Apollo of the woods--tall and  graceful, yet robust and sinewy, inimitable in hang of foliage and  throwing-out of limb; as if the beauteous, vital, leafy creature could  walk, if it only would\"; and mentions that in a dream-trance he actually  once saw his \"favorite trees step out and promenade up, down and around  VERY CURIOUSLY.\" (1) Once the present writer seemed to have a partial  vision of a tree. It was a beech, standing somewhat isolated, and  still leafless in quite early Spring. Suddenly I was aware of its  skyward-reaching arms and up-turned finger-tips, as if some vivid life  (or electricity) was streaming through them far into the spaces of  heaven, and of its roots plunged in the earth and drawing the same  energies from below. The day was quite still and there was no movement  in the branches, but in that moment the tree was no longer a separate or  separable organism, but a vast being ramifying far into space, sharing  and uniting the life of Earth and Sky, and full of a most amazing  activity.     (1) Specimen Days, 1882-3 Edition, p. iii.      The reader of this will probably have had some similar experiences.  Perhaps he will have seen a full-foliaged Lombardy poplar swaying in  half a gale in June--the wind and the sun streaming over every little  twig and leaf, the tree throwing out its branches in a kind of ecstasy  and bathing them in the passionately boisterous caresses of its two  visitants; or he will have heard the deep glad murmur of some huge  sycamore with ripening seed clusters when after weeks of drought the  steady warm rain brings relief to"]]]
