The bishop of Chichester gave a general absolution  to the army, accompanied with assurances, that, if any of them fell in  the ensuing action, they would infallibly be received into heaven, as  the reward of their suffering in so meritorious a cause.         * M. Paris, p. 669. W. Heming. p. 583.    Leicester, who possessed great talents for war, conducted his march with  such skill and secrecy, that he had well nigh surprised the royalists  in their quarters at Lewes, in Sussex, but the vigilance and activity of  Prince Edward soon repaired this negligence; and he led out the king's  army to the field in three bodies. He himself conducted the van,  attended by Earl Warrenne and William de Valence; the main body was  commanded by the king of the Romans and his son Henry; the king himself  was placed in the rear at the head of his principal nobility. Prince  Edward rushed upon the Londoners who had demanded the post of honor in  leading the rebel army, but who, from their ignorance of discipline and  want of experience, were ill fitted to resist the gentry and military  men, of whom the prince's body was composed. They were broken in an  instant; were chased off the field; and Edward, transported by his  martial ardor, and eager to revenge the insolence of the Londoners  against his mother,[*] put them to the sword for the length of four  miles, without giving them any quarter, and without reflecting on the  fate which in the mean time attended the rest of the army. The earl of  Leicester, seeing the royalists thrown into confusion by their eagerness  in the pursuit, led on his remaining troops against the bodies commanded  by the two royal brothers: he defeated with great slaughter the forces  headed by the king of the Romans; and that prince was obliged to yield  himself prisoner to the earl of Glocester: he penetrated to the body  where the king himself was placed, threw it into disorder, pursued  his advantage, chased it into the town of Lewes, and obliged Henry to  surrender himself prisoner.[**]    Prince Edward, returning to the field of battle from his precipitate  pursuit of the Londoners, was astonished to find it covered with the  dead bodies of his friends, and still more to hear that his father and  uncle were defeated and taken prisoners, and that Arundel, Comyn, Brus,  Hamond l'Estrange, Roger Leybourne, and many considerable barons of his  party were in the hands of the victorious enemy. Earl Warrenne, Hugh  Bigod, and William de Valence, struck with despair at this event,  immediately took to flight, hurried to Pevencey, and made their escape  beyond sea:[***] but the prince, intrepid amidst the greatest disasters,  exhorted his troops to revenge the death of their friends, to relieve  the royal captives, and to snatch an easy conquest from an enemy  disordered by their own victory.[****] He found his followers  intimidated by their situation, while Leicester, afraid of a sudden and  violent blow from the prince, amused him by a feigned negotiation, till  he was able to recall his troops from the pursuit, and to bring them  into order.[*****]         * M.

There now appeared no further resource to the royal party, surrounded  by the armies and garrisons of the enemy, destitute of forage and  provisions, and deprived of their sovereign, as well as of their  principal leaders, who could alone inspirit them to an obstinate  resistance. The prince, therefore, was obliged to submit to Leicester's  terms, which were short and severe, agreeably to the suddenness and  necessity of the situation. He stipulated that he and Henry d'Allmaine  should surrender themselves prisoners as pledges in lieu of the two  kings; that all other prisoners on both sides should be released;[*] and  that in order to settle fully the terms of agreement, application should  be made to the king of France, that he should name six Frenchmen, three  prelates and three noblemen; these six to choose two others of their  own country, and these two to choose one Englishman, who, in conjunction  with themselves, were to be invested by both parties with full powers  to make what regulations they thought proper for the settlement of the  kingdom. The prince and young Henry accordingly delivered themselves  into Leicester's hands, who sent them under a guard to Dover Castle.  Such are the terms of agreement, commonly called the Mise of Lewes, from  an obsolete French term of that meaning; for it appears that all the  gentry and nobility of England, who valued themselves on their Norman  extraction, and who disdained the language of their native country, made  familiar use of the French tongue till this period, and for some time  after.    Leicester had no sooner obtained this great advantage and gotten the  whole royal family in his power, than he openly violated every article  of the treaty, and acted as sole master, and even tyrant of the kingdom.  He still detained the king in effect a prisoner, and made use of that  prince's authority to purposes the most prejudicial to his interests,  and the most oppressive of his people.[**] He every where disarmed the  royalists, and kept all his own partisans in, a military posture:[***]  he observed the same partial conduct in the deliverance of the captives,  and even threw many of the royalists into prison, besides those who were  taken in the battle of Lewes; he carried the king from place to place,  and obliged all the royal castles, on pretence of Henry's commands, to  receive a governor and garrison of his own appointment.         * M.

All the officers of the crown and of the household were named by him,  and the whole authority, as well as arms of the state, was lodged in his  hands: he instituted in the counties a new kind of magistracy, endowed  with new and arbitrary powers, that of conservators of the peace;[*]  his avarice appeared bare-faced, and might induce us to question the  greatness of his ambition, at least the largeness of his mind, if we had  not reason to think that he intended to employ his acquisitions as the  instruments for attaining further power and grandeur. He seized the  estates of no less than eighteen barons as his share of the spoil gained  in the battle of Lewes: he engrossed to himself the ransom of all the  prisoners; and told his barons, with a wanton insolence, that it was  sufficient for them that he had saved them by that victory from the  forfeitures and attainders which hung over them:[**] he even treated the  earl of Glocester in the same injurious manner, and applied to his own  use the ransom of the king of the Romans, who in the field of battle had  yielded himself prisoner to that nobleman. Henry, his eldest son, made a  monopoly of all the wool in the kingdom, the only valuable commodity for  foreign markets which it at that time produced.[***] The inhabitants of  the cinque ports, during the present dissolution of government, betook  themselves to the most licentious piracy, preyed on the ships of all  nations, threw the mariners into the sea, and by these practices,  soon banished all merchants from the English coasts and harbors. Every  foreign commodity rose to an exorbitant price, and woollen cloth, which  the English had not then the art of dyeing, was worn by them white, and  without receiving the last hand of the manufacturer. In answer to the  complaints which arose on this occasion, Leicester replied that  the kingdom could well enough subsist within itself, and needed no  intercourse with foreigners. And it was found that he even combined with  the pirates of the cinque ports, and received as his share the third of  their prizes.[****]         * Rymer, vol. i. p. 792.         ** Knyghton, p. 2451.         *** Chron. T. Wykes, p. 65.         **** Chron. T. Wykes, p. 6.    No further mention was made of the reference to the king of France, so  essential an article in the agreement of Lewes; and Leicester summoned a  parliament, composed altogether of his own partisans, in order to  rivet, by their authority, that power which he had acquired by so much  violence, and which he used with so much tyranny and injustice. An  ordinance was there passed, to which the king's consent had been  previously extorted, that every act of royal power should be exercised  by a council of nine persons, who were to be chosen and removed by the  majority of three, Leicester himself, the earl of Glocester, and the  bishop of Chichester.[*] By this intricate plan of government, the  sceptre was really put into Leicester's hands; as he had the entire  direction of the bishop of Chichester, and thereby commanded all the  resolutions of the council of three, who could appoint or discard at  pleasure every member of the supreme council.    But it was impossible that things could long remain in this strange  situation. It behoved Leicester either to descend with some peril  into the rank of a subject, or to mount up with no less into that of  a sovereign; and his ambition, unrestrained either by fear or by  principle, gave too much reason to suspect him of the latter intention.  Meanwhile he was exposed to anxiety from every quarter; and felt that  the smallest incident was capable of overturning that immense and  ill-cemented fabric which he had reared. The queen, whom her husband  had left abroad, had collected in foreign parts an army of desperate  adventurers, and had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19213"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part C. (#13)"],[1,"for repelling the invaders than for joining them.  Perkin, that he might support his pretensions to royal birth, feigned  great compassion for the misery of his plundered subjects, and publicly  remonstrated with his ally against the depredations exercised by the  Scottish army;[*] but James told him, that he doubted his concern was  employed only in behalf of an enemy, and that he was anxious to preserve  what never should belong to him. That prince now began to perceive that  his attempt would be fruitless; and hearing of an army which was on its  march to attack him, he thought proper to retreat into his own country.         * Polyd. Virg. p. 598.    The king discovered little anxiety to procure either reparation or  vengeance for this insult committed on him by the Scottish nation: his  chief concern was to draw advantage from it, by the pretence which it  might afford him to levy impositions on his own subjects. He summoned a  parliament, to whom he made bitter complaints against the irruption of  the Scots, the absurd imposture countenanced by that nation, the cruel  devastations committed in the northern counties, and the multiplied  insults thus offered both to the king and kingdom of England. The  parliament made the expected return to this discourse, by granting  a subsidy to the amount of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds,  together with two fifteenths. After making this grant, they were  dismissed.    {1497.} The vote of parliament for imposing the tax was without much  difficulty procured by the authority of Henry but he found it not  so easy to levy the money upon his subjects. The people, who were  acquainted with the immense treasures which he had amassed, could ill  brook the new impositions raised on every slight occasion; and it is  probable that the flaw which was universally known to be in his title,  made his reign the more subject to insurrections and rebellions. When  the subsidy began to be levied in Cornwall, the inhabitants, numerous  and poor, robust and courageous, murmured against a tax occasioned by a  sudden inroad of the Scots, from which they esteemed themselves entirely  secure, and which had usually been repelled by the force of the northern  counties. Their ill humor was further incited by one Michael Joseph, a  farrier of Bodmin, a notable prating fellow, who, by thrusting himself  forward on every occasion, and being loudest in every complaint against  the government, had acquired an authority among those rude people.  Thomas Flammoc, too, a lawyer, who had become the oracle of the  neighborhood, encouraged the sedition, by informing them that the tax,  though imposed by parliament, was entirely illegal; that the northern  nobility were bound by their tenures to defend the nation against the  Scots; and that if these new impositions were tamely submitted to,  the avarice of Henry and of his ministers would soon render the burden  intolerable to the nation. The Cornish, he said, must deliver to the  king a petition, seconded by such a force as would give it authority;  and in order to procure the concurrence of the rest of the kingdom,  care must be taken, by their orderly deportment, to show that they  had nothing in view but the public good, and the redress of all those  grievances under which the people had so long labored.    Encouraged by these speeches, the multitude flocked together, and armed  themselves with axes, bills, bows, and such weapons as country people  are usually possessed of. Flammoc and Joseph were chosen their leaders.  They soon conducted the Cornish through the county of Devon, and reached  that of Somerset. At Taunton, the rebels killed, in their fury, an  officious and eager commissioner of the subsidy, whom they called the  provost of Perin. When they reached Wells, they were joined by Lord  Audley, a nobleman of an ancient family, popular in his deportment, but  vain, ambitious and restless in his temper. He had from the beginning  maintained a secret correspondence with the first movers of the  insurrection, and was now joyfully received by them as their leader.  Proud of the countenance given them by so considerable a nobleman, they  continued their march, breathing destruction to the king's ministers  and favorites, particularly to Morton, now a cardinal, and Sir  Reginald Bray, who were deemed the most active instruments in all his  oppressions. Notwithstanding their rage against the administration, they  carefully followed the directions given them by their leaders; and as  they met with no resistance, they committed, during their march, no  violence or disorder.    The rebels had been told by Flammoc that the inhabitants of Kent,  as they had ever, during all ages, remained unsubdued, and had even  maintained their independence during the Norman conquest, would surely  embrace their party, and declare themselves for a cause which was no  other than that of public good and general liberty. But the Kentish  people had very lately distinguished themselves by repelling Perkin's  invasion; and as they had received from the king many gracious  acknowledgments for this service, their affections were by that means  much conciliated to his government. It was easy, therefore, for the  earl of Kent, Lord Abergavenny, and Lord Cobham, who possessed great  authority in those parts, to retain the people in obedience; and the  Cornish rebels, though they pitched their camp near Eltham, at the  very gates of London, and invited all the people to join them, got  reenforcement from no quarter. There wanted not discontents every where,  but no one would take part in so rash and ill-concerted an enterprise;  and besides, the situation in which the king's affairs then stood  discouraged even the boldest and most daring.    Henry, in order to oppose the Scots, had already levied an army, which  he put under the command of Lord Daubeney, the chamberlain; and as  soon as he heard of the Cornish insurrection, he ordered it to march  southwards and suppress the rebels. Not to leave the northern frontier  defenceless, he despatched thither the earl of Surrey, who assembled the  forces on the borders, and made head against the enemy. Henry found  here the concurrence of the three most fatal incidents that can befall a  monarchy; a foreign enemy, a domestic rebellion, and a pretender to  his crown; but he enjoyed great resources in his army and treasure, and  still more in the intrepidity and courage of his own temper. He did not,  however, immediately give full scope to his military spirit. On other  occasions, he had always hastened to a decision; and it was a usual  saying with him, \"that he desired but to see his rebels:\" but as the  Cornish mutineers behaved in an inoffensive manner, and committed no  spoil on the country; as they received no accession of force on their  march or in their encampment, and as such hasty and popular tumults  might be expected to diminish every moment by delay; he took post in  London, and assiduously prepared the means of insuring victory.    After all his forces were collected, he divided them into three bodies,  and marched out to assail the enemy. The first body, commanded by the  earl of Oxford, and under him by the earls of Essex and Suffolk, were  appointed to place themselves behind the hill on which the rebels were  encamped: the second, and most considerable, Henry put under the command  of Lord Daubeney, and ordered him to attack the enemy in front, and  bring on the action. The third he kept as a body of reserve about his  own person, and took post in St. George's Fields; where he secured the  city, and could easily, as occasion served, either restore the fight or  finish the victory. To put the enemy off their guard, he had spread  a report that he was not to attack them till some days after; and the  better to confirm them in this opinion, he began not the action till  near the evening. Daubeney beat a detachment of the rebels from Deptford  bridge; and before their main body could be in order to receive him, he  had gained the ascent of the hill, and placed himself in array before  them. They were formidable from their numbers, being sixteen thousand  strong, and were not defective in valor; but being tumultuary troops,  ill armed, and not provided with cavalry or artillery, they were but  an unequal match for the king's forces. Daubeney began the attack with  courage, and even with a contempt of the enemy which had almost proved  fatal to him. He rushed into the midst of them, and was taken prisoner;  but soon after was released by his own troops. After some resistance,  the rebels were broken and put to flight.[*]         * Polyd. Virg. p. 601.    Lord Audley, Flammoc, and Joseph, their leaders, were taken, and all  three executed. The latter seemed even to exult in his end, and boasted,  with a preposterous ambition, that he should make a figure in his tory.  The rebels, being surrounded on every side by the king's troops, were  almost all made prisoners; and immediately dismissed without further  punishment: whether, that Henry was satisfied with the victims who had  fallen in the field, and who amounted to near two thousand, or that he  pitied the ignorance and simplicity of the multitude, or favored them  on account of their inoffensive behavior; or was pleased that they had  never, during their insurrection, disputed his title, and had shown  no attachment to the house of York, the highest crime of which, in his  eyes, they could have been guilty.    The Scottish king was not idle during these commotions in England. He  levied a considerable army, and sat down before the Castle of Norham, in  Northumberland; but found that place, by the precaution of Fox, bishop  of Durham, so well provided both with men and ammunition, that he made  little or no progress in the siege. Hearing that the earl of Surrey had  collected some forces, and was advancing upon him, he retreated into  his own country, and left"]]]
