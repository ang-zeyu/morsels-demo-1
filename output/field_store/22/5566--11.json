In place of the quiet cloud I had [Page 87]  left, the air--if I may use the expression--was filled with the  flying _debris_, a mass of detached vertical fusi-form fragments,  each from ten to thirty seconds (_i. e._, from four thousand five  hundred to thirteen thousand five hundred miles) long, by two or  three seconds (nine hundred to thirteen hundred and fifty miles)  wide--brighter, and closer together where the pillars had formerly  stood, and rapidly ascending. When I looked, some of them had  already reached a height of nearly four minutes (100,000 miles); and  while I watched them they arose with a motion almost perceptible to  the eye, until, in ten minutes, the uppermost were more than 200,000  miles above the solar surface. This was ascertained by careful  measurements, the mean of three closely accordant determinations  giving 210,000 miles as the extreme altitude attained. I am  particular in the statement, because, so far as I know,  chromatospheric matter (red hydrogen in this case) has never before  been observed at any altitude exceeding five minutes, or 135,000  miles. The velocity of ascent, also--one hundred and sixty-seven  miles per second--is considerably greater than anything hitherto  recorded. * * * As the filaments arose, they gradually faded away  like a dissolving cloud, and at a quarter past one only a few filmy  wisps, with some brighter streamers low down near the  chromatosphere, remained to mark the place. But in the mean while  the little 'thunder-head' before alluded to had grown and developed  wonderfully into a mass of rolling and ever-changing flame, to speak  according to appearances. First, it was crowded down, as it were,  along the solar surface; later, it arose almost pyramidally 50,000  miles in height; then [Page 88] its summit was drawn down into long  filaments and threads, which were most curiously rolled backward and  forward, like the volutes of an Ionic capital, and finally faded  away, and by half-past two had vanished like the other. The whole  phenomenon suggested most forcibly the idea of an explosion under  the great prominence, acting mainly upward, but also in all  directions outward; and then, after an interval, followed by a  corresponding in-rush.\"    No language can convey nor mind conceive an idea of the fierce  commotion we here contemplate. If we call these movements hurricanes,  we must remember that what we use as a figure moves but one hundred  miles an hour, while these move one hundred miles a second. Such  storms of fire on earth, \"coming down upon us from the north, would,  in thirty seconds after they had crossed the St. Lawrence, be in  the Gulf of Mexico, carrying with them the whole surface of the  continent in a mass not simply of ruins but of glowing vapor, in  which the vapors arising from the dissolution of the materials  composing the cities of Boston, New York, and Chicago would be  mixed in a single indistinguishable cloud.\" In the presence of  these evident visions of an actual body in furious flame, we need  hesitate no longer in accepting as true the words of St. Peter  of the time \"in which the [atmospheric] heavens shall pass away  with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat;  the earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burned  up.\"    This region of discontinuous flame below the corona is called the  chromosphere. Hydrogen is the principal material of its upper part;  iron, magnesium, and other [Page 89] metals, some of them as yet  unknown on earth, but having a record in the spectrum, in the denser  parts below. If these fierce fires are a part of the Sun, as they  assuredly are, its diameter would be from 1,060,000 to 1,260,000  miles.    Let us approach even nearer. We see a clearly recognized even disk,  of equal dimensions in every direction. This is the photosphere.  We here reach some definitely measurable data for estimating its  visible size. We already know its distance. Its disk subtends an  angle of 32' 12\".6, or a little more than half a degree. Three  hundred and sixty such suns, laid side by side, would span the  celestial arch from east to west with a half circle of light. Two  lines drawn from our earth at the angle mentioned would be 860,000  miles apart at the distance of 92,500,000 miles. This, then, is  the diameter of the visible and measurable part of the sun. It  would require one hundred and eight globes like the earth in a line  to measure the sun's diameter, and three hundred and thirty-nine,  to be strung like the beads of a necklace, to encircle his waist.  The sun has a volume equal to 1,245,000 earths, but being only  one-quarter as dense, it has a mass of only 326,800 earths. It  has seven hundred times the mass of all the planets, asteroids,  and satellites put together. Thus it is able to control them all  by its greater power of attraction.    Concerning the condition of the surface of the sun many opinions  are held. That it is hot beyond all estimate is indubitable. Whether  solid or gaseous we are not sure. Opinions differ: some incline to  the first theory, others to the second; some deem the sun composed  of solid particles, floating in gas so condensed [Page 90] by  pressure and attraction as to shine like a solid. It has no sensible  changes of general level, but has prodigious activity in spots.  These spots have been the objects of earnest and almost hourly study  on the part of such men as Secchi, Lockyer, Faye, Young, and others,  for years. But it is a long way off to study an object. No telescope  brings it nearer than 200,000 miles. Theory after theory has been  advanced, each one satisfactory in some points, none in all. The  facts about the spots are these: They are most abundant on the two  sides of the equator. They are gregarious, depressed below the  surface, of vast extent, black in the centre, usually surrounded by  a region of partial darkness, beyond which is excessive light. They  have motion of their own over the surface--motion rotating about an  axis, upward and downward about the edges. They change their  apparent shape as the sun carries them across its disk by axial  revolution, being narrow as they present their edges to us, and  rounder as we look perpendicularly into them (Fig. 35).    [Illustration: Fig. 35.--Change in Spots as rotated across the Disk,  showing Cavities.]    These spots are also very variable in number, sometimes there being  none for nearly two hundred days, and again whole years during which  the sun is never without them. The period from minimum to maximum  [Page 91] of spots is about eleven years. We might look for them  again and again in vain this year (1878). They will be most numerous  in 1882 and 1893. The cause of this periodicity was inferred to be  the near approach of the enormous planet Jupiter, causing  disturbance by its attraction. But the periods do not correspond,  and the cause is the result of some law of solar action to us as yet  unknown.    These spots may be seen with almost any telescope, the eye being  protected by deeply colored glasses.    Until within one hundred years they were supposed to be islands of  scoriae floating in the sea of molten matter. But they were depressed  below the surface, and showed a notch when on the edge. Wilson  originated and Herschel developed the theory that the sun's real  body was dark, cool, and habitable, and that the photosphere was  a luminous stratum at a distance from the real body, with openings  showing the dark spots below. Such a sun would have cooled off in  a week, but would previously have annihilated all life below.    The solar spots being most abundant on the two sides of the equator,  indicates their cyclonic character; the centre of a cyclone is  rarefied, and therefore colder, and cold on the sun is darkness.  M. Faye says: \"Like our cyclones, they are descending, as I have  proved by a special study of these terrestrial phenomena. They  carry down into the depths of the solar mass the cooler materials  of the upper layers, formed principally of hydrogen, and thus produce  in their centre a decided extinction of light and heat as long as  the gyratory movement continues. Finally, the hydrogen set free  at the base of the whirlpool becomes reheated at this [Page 92]  great depth, and rises up tumultuously around the whirlpool, forming  irregular jets, which appear above the chromosphere. These jets  constitute the protuberances. The whirlpools of the sun, like those  on the earth, are of all dimensions, from the scarcely visible pores  to the enormous spots which we see from time to time. They have,  like those of the earth, a marked tendency, first to increase and  then to break up, and thus form a row of spots extending along the  same parallel.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 36.--Solar spot, by Langley.]    A spot of 20,000 miles diameter is quite small; there was one 14,816  miles across, visible to the naked eye for a week in 1843. This  particular sun-spot somewhat [Page 93] helped the Millerites. On the  day of the eclipse, in 1858, a spot over 107,000 miles in extent was  clearly seen. In such vast tempests, if there were ships built as  large as the whole earth, they would be tossed like autumn leaves in  an ocean storm.    The revolution of the sun carries a spot across its face in about  fourteen days. After a lapse of as much more time, they often reappear  on the other side, changed but recognizable. They often break ont  or disappear under the eye of the observer. They divide like a  piece of ice dropped on a frozen pond, the pieces sliding off in  every direction, or combine like separate floes driven"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15625"],[0,"The Lookout Man (#13)"],[1,"come. She had been so friendly,  so understandingly sympathetic--she must know how long the days were  up there.    On the third day Hank came riding up the trail that sought the easiest  slopes. He brought coal-oil and bacon and coffee and smoking tobacco  and the week's accumulation of newspapers, and three magazines; but he  did not bring any word from Marion Rose, nor the magazines she had  promised. When Hank had unsaddled the horses to rest their backs, and  had eaten his lunch and had smoked a cigarette in the shade of a rock,  his slow thoughts turned to the gossip of his little world.    He told of the latest encounter with the crabbed fireman on Claremont,  grinning appreciatively because the fireman's ill temper had been  directed at a tourist who had gone up with Hank. He related a small  scandal that was stirring the social pond of Quincy, and at last he  swung nearer to the four who had taken mining claims along Toll Gate  Creek.    \"Too bad you can't go down to Toll-house an' git acquainted with your  neighbors,\" he drawled half maliciously. \"There's a girl in the bunch  that's sure easy to look at. Other one is an old maid--looks too much  like a schoolma'm to suit me. But say--I'm liable to make a trip up  here twice a week, from now on! I'm liable to eat my dinner 'fore I  git here, too. Some class to that girl, now, believe me! Only trouble  is, I'm kinda afraid one of the men has got a string on her. There's  two of 'em in the outfit. One is one of them he schoolma'ms that goes  around in a boiled shirt and a hard-boiled hat, buzzin' like a  mosquito. He's sweet on the old maid. It's the other one I'm leery of.  He's the brother of the old maid, and he's the kind that don't say  much but does a lot uh thinkin'. Big, too.    \"They've took up a bunch of minin' claims around there and are livin'  in that cabin. Goin' to winter there, the old maid was tellin' me. I  brought out their mail to 'em. Marion Rose is the girl's name. I guess  she's got a feller or two down in Los Angeles--I brought out a couple  letters today in men's writin'--different hands, at that.    \"They's somethin' queer about 'em that I can't see through. They was  both settin' out in the sun--on that log right by the trail as you go  in to the cabin--and they'd washed their hair and had it all down  their backs dryin' it. And the girl was cleanin' the old maid's finger  nails for her! I come purty near astin' the old maid if she had to  have somebody wash her face for her too. But they didn't seem to think  it was anything outa the way at all--they went right to talkin' and  visitin' like they was fixed for company. I kinda s'picion Marion  bleaches her hair. Seems to me like it's a mite too yeller to be  growed that way. Drugstore blonde, I'd call her. You take notice first  time you see her. I'll bet you'll say--\"    \"Aw, can that chatter, you poor fish!\" Jack exploded unexpectedly, and  smote Hank on his lantern jaw with the flat of his palm. \"You hick  from hick-town! You brainless ape! You ain't a man--you're a missing  link! Give you a four-foot tail, by harry, and you'd go down the  mountain swinging from branch to branch like the monkey that you are!  What are _you_, you poor piece of cheese, to talk about a woman?\"    His hand to his jaw, Hank got up from where he had sprawled on his  back. He was not a fighting man, preferring to satisfy his grudges by  slurring people behind their backs. But Jack smacked him again and  thought of a few other things to which he might liken Hank, and after  that Hank fought like a trapped bobcat, with snarls and kicks and  gouging claws. He scratched Jack's neck with his grimy fingernails,  and he tried to set his unwashed teeth into Jack's left ear while the  two of them rolled over and over on the slippery mat of squaw-carpet.  And for that he was pummeled unmercifully before Jack tore himself  loose and got up.    \"Now, you beat it!\" Jack finished, panting. \"And after this you keep  your tongue off the subject of women. Don't dare to mention even a  squaw to me, or I'll pitch you clean off the peak!\"    Hank mumbled an insult, and Jack went after him again. All the misery,  all the pent-up bitterness of the past three months rose within him in  a sudden storm that clouded his reason. He fought Hank like a crazy  man--not so much because Hank was Hank and had spoken slightingly of  that slim girl, but because Hank was something concrete, something  which Jack could beat with his fists and that could give back blow for  blow. Too long had he waged an unequal conflict with his own thoughts,  his aloneness; with regrets and soul hunger and idleness. When he had  spent his strength and most of his rage together, he let Hank go and  felt tenderly his own bruised knuckles.    He never knew how close he was to death in the next five minutes,  while Hank was saddling up to go. For Hank's fingers went several  times to his rifle and hovered there, itching to do murder, while  Hank's mind revolved the consequences. Murder would be  madness--suicide, practically. The boy would be missed when he did not  answer the telephone. Some one would be sent up from the Forest  Service and the murder would be discovered, unless--unless Hank could  hide the body. There was the lake--but the lake was so clear! Besides,  there was always the chance at this season of the year that some  tourist would be within sight. Some tourist might even hear the shot.  It would be risky--too risky. Like Jack's, his rage cooled while he  busied himself mechanically with saddling his horse. After all, Hank  was not criminally inclined, except as anger drove him. He set the  pack-saddle and empty sacks on the pack horse, led his horse a few  feet farther away and mounted, scowling.    In the saddle he turned and looked for the first time full at Jack.  \"You think you're darn smart!\" he snarled wryly because of a cut lip  that had swollen all on one side. \"You may think you're smart, but  they's another day comin'. You wait--that's all I got to say!\"    It did not make him feel any better when Jack laughed suddenly and  loud. \"_R-r-r-evenge_! By my heart's blood, I shall have r-r-evenge!\"  he intoned mockingly. \"Gwan outa my sight, Hank. You ain't making any  hit with me at all. _Scat!\"_    \"All right fer you!\" Hank grumbled, in the futile repartee of the  stupid. \"You think you're smart, but I don't. You wait!\" Then he rode  away down the trail, glowering at the world through puffy lids and  repeating to himself many crushing things he wished he had thought to  say to Jack.    Jack himself had recourse to a small bottle of iodine left there by a  predecessor, painting his scratches liberally, and grinning at himself  in the little mirror because Hank had not once landed a bruising blow  on his face. After that he washed the dishes and went to the spring  for a bucket of fresh water, whistling all the way. It was amazing how  that fight had cleared his mental atmosphere.    After that, he perched up on the little rock pinnacle just behind the  station, and stared down the mountain toward Toll-Gate Flat, where she  lived. He saw Hank ride into the balsam thicket; and he, too, thought  of several things he regretted not having said to Hank. What rotten  luck it was that he should be held up here on that pinnacle while Hank  Brown could ride at his leisure down into that tiny valley! The  government ought to gather up all the Hank Browns in the country and  put them up on such places as these, and let decent fellows do the  riding around.    Down there, beyond the trail, on a slope where the manzanita was not  quite so matted together, he saw something move slowly. Then it  stopped, and he got a gleam of light, the reflection, evidently of  some bright object. He lifted the telescope and focussed it, and his  heart came leaping up into his throat just as the figure came leaping  into close view through the powerful lense.    It was Marion Rose, up by the hydrometer that looked something like a  lone beehive perched on a wild slope by itself. She was sitting on a  rock with her feet crossed, and she was inspecting her chin in the  tiny mirror of her vanity bag. Some blemish--or more likely an insect  bite, from the way her fingertip pressed carefully a certain point of  her chin--seemed to hold all her attention. It was the sun flashing on  the bit of mirror that had made the gleam.    Jack watched her hungrily; her slim shape, leaning negligently  sidewise; her hat pushed back a little; her hair, the color of ripe  corn, fluffed where the wind had blown it; the clear, delicate, creamy  tint of her skin, her mouth curved in soft, red lines that held one's  eyes fascinated when they moved in speech. He watched her, never  thinking of the rudeness of it.    And then he saw her lift her face and look up to the peak, directly at  him, it seemed to him. His face turned hot, and he lowered the glass  guiltily. But of course she could not see him--or if she could, he  looked no more than a speck on the rock. He lifted the telescope  again, and her face jumped into close view. She was still looking up  his way, the little mirror turning idly in her hand. Her face was  thoughtful; almost wistful, he dared to think. Perhaps she was  lonesome, too. She had told him that she had spells of being terribly  lonesome.    Jack had an inspiration. He climbed hurriedly down off the rock, got  his own looking glass and climbed back again. He turned the glass so  that the sun shown on it aslant and threw a glare toward her. Then he  lifted the telescope quickly to see if she noticed the sparkle. After  a moment he decided that she had seen it but did not quite know what  had caused it. At any rate, she was still looking that way, which was  something.    Like the boy he was, he lay down on his stomach, balanced the  telescope across a splintered notch in the rock so that he could  steady it with one hand, and with the other he tilted the"]]]
