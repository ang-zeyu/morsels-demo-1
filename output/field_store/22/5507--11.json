In  advance of these again, he erected three successive pylons, one behind the  other. The whole presented the appearance of a vast rectangle placed  crosswise at the end of another rectangle. Thothmes II. and Hatshepsut[18]  covered the walls erected by their father with bas-relief sculptures, but  added no more buildings. Hatshepsut, however, in order to bring in her  obelisks between the pylons of Thothmes I., opened a breach in the south  wall, and overthrew sixteen of the columns which stood in that spot.  Thothmes III., probably finding certain parts of the structure unworthy of  the god, rebuilt the first pylon, and also the double sanctuary, which he  renewed in the red granite of Syene. To the eastward, he rebuilt some old  chambers, the most important among them being the processional hall, used  for the starting-point and halting-place of ceremonial processions, and  these he surrounded with a stone wall. He also made the lake whereon the  sacred boats were launched on festival days; and, with a sharp change of  axis, he built two pylons facing towards the south, thus violating the true  relative proportion which had till then subsisted between the body and the  front of the general mass of the building. The outer enclosure was now too  large for the earlier pylons, and did not properly accord with the later  ones. Amenhotep III. corrected this defect. He erected a sixth and yet more  massive pylon, which was, therefore, better suited for the facade. As it  now stood (fig. 84), the temple surpassed even the boldest architectural  enterprises hitherto attempted; but the Pharaohs of the Nineteenth Dynasty  succeeded in achieving still more. They added only a hypostyle hall (fig.  85) and a pylon; but the hypostyle hall measured 170 feet in length by 329  feet in breadth. Down the centre they carried a main avenue of twelve  columns, with lotus-flower capitals, being the loftiest ever erected in the  interior of a building; while in the aisles, ranged in seven rows on either  side, they planted 122 columns with lotus-bud capitals. The roof of the  great nave rose to a height of 75 feet above the level of the ground, and  the pylon stood some fifty feet higher still. During a whole century, three  kings laboured to perfect this hypostyle hall. Rameses I. conceived the  idea; Seti I. finished the bulk of the work, and Rameses II. wrought nearly  the whole of the decoration. The Pharaohs of the next following dynasties  vied with each other for such blank spaces as might be found, wherein to  engrave their names upon the columns, and so to share the glory of the  three founders; but farther they did not venture. Left thus, however, the  monument was still incomplete. It still needed one last pylon and a  colonnaded court. Nearly three centuries elapsed before the task was again  taken in hand. At last the Bubastite kings decided to begin the colonnades,  but their work was as feeble as their, resources were limited. Taharkah,  the Ethiopian, imagined for a moment that he was capable of rivalling the  great Theban Pharaohs, and planned a hypostyle hall even larger than the  first; but he made a false start. The columns of the great nave, which were  all that he had time to erect, were placed too wide apart to admit of being  roofed over; so they never supported anything, but remained as memorials of  his failure. Finally, the Ptolemies, faithful to the traditions of the  native monarchy, threw themselves into the work; but their labours were  interrupted by revolts at Thebes, and the earthquake of the year 27 B.C.  destroyed part of the temple, so that the pylon remained for ever  unfinished. The history of Karnak is identical with that of all the great  Egyptian temples. When closely studied, the reason why they are for the  most part so irregular becomes evident. The general plan is practically the  same, and the progress of the building was carried forward in the same  way; but the architects could not always foresee the future importance of  their work, and the site was not always favourable to the development of  the building. At Luxor (fig. 86), the progress went on methodically enough  under Amenhotep III. and Seti I., but when Rameses II. desired to add to  the work of his predecessors, a bend in the river compelled him to turn  eastwards. His pylon is not parallel to that of Amenhotep III., and his  colonnades make a distinct angle with the general axis of the earlier work.  At Philae (fig. 87) the deviation is still greater. Not only is the larger  pylon out of alignment with the smaller, but the two colonnades are not  parallel with each other. Neither are they attached to the pylon with a due  regard to symmetry. This arises neither from negligence nor wilfulness, as  is popularly supposed. The first plan was as regular as the most  symmetrically-minded designer could wish; but it became necessary to adapt  it to the requirements of the site, and the architects were thenceforth  chiefly concerned to make the best of the irregularities to which they were  condemned by the configuration of the ground. Such difficulties were, in  fact, a frequent source of inspiration; and Philae shows with what skill  the Egyptians extracted every element of beauty and picturesqueness from  enforced disorder.    [Illustration: Fig. 88.--Plan of Speos, Kalaat Addah, Nubia.]    [Illustration: Fig, 89.--Plan of Speos, Gebel Silsileh.]    [Illustration: Fig. 90.--Plan of the Great Speos, Abu Simbel.]    [Illustration: Fig. 91.--Speos of Hathor, Abu Simbel.]    [Illustration: Fig. 92.--Plan of the upper portion of the temple of Deir el  Bahari, showing the state of the excavations, the Speos of Hathor (A); the  rock-cut sanctuary (B); the rock-cut funerary chapel of Thothmes I. (C);  the Speos of Anubis (D); and the excavated niches of the northern  colonnade. Reproduced from Plate III. of the _Archaeological Report of the  Egypt Exploration Fund_ for 1893-4.]    [Illustration: Fig. 93.--Plan of temple of Seti I., at Abydos.]    The idea of the rock-cut temple must have occurred to the Egyptians at an  early period. They carved the houses of the dead in the mountain side; why,  therefore, should they not in like manner carve the houses of the gods? Yet  the earliest known Speos-sanctuaries date from only the beginning of the  Eighteenth Dynasty. They are generally found in those parts of the valley  where the cultivable land is narrowest, as near Beni Hasan, at Gebel  Silsileh, and in Nubia. All varieties of the constructed temple are found  in the rock-cut temple, though more or less modified by local conditions.  The Speos Artemidos is approached by a pillared portico, but contains only  a square chamber with a niche at the end for the statue of the goddess  Pakhet. At Kalaat Addah (fig. 88), a flat narrow facade (A) faces the  river, and is reached by a steep flight of steps; next comes a hypostyle  hall (B), flanked by two dark chambers (C), and lastly a sanctuary in two  storeys, one above the other (D). The chapel of Horemheb (fig. 89), at  Gebel Silsileh, is formed of a gallery parallel to the river (A), supported  by four massive pillars left in the rock. From this gallery, the sanctuary  chamber opens at right angles. At Abu Simbel, the two temples are excavated  entirely in the cliff. The front of the great speos (fig. 90) imitates a  sloping pylon crowned with a cornice, and guarded as usual by four seated  colossi flanked by smaller statues. These colossi are sixty-six feet high.  The doorway passed, there comes a first hall measuring 130 feet in length  by 60 feet in width, which corresponds to the usual peristyle. Eight  Osiride statues backed by as many square pillars, seem to bear the  mountain on their heads. Beyond this come (1) a hypostyle hall; (2) a  transverse gallery, isolating the sanctuary, and (3) the sanctuary itself,  between two smaller chambers. Eight crypts, sunk at a somewhat lower level  than that of the main excavation, are unequally distributed to right and  left of the peristyle. The whole excavation measures 180 feet from the  doorway to the end of the sanctuary. The small speos of Hathor, about a  hundred paces to the northward, is of smaller dimensions. The facade is  adorned with six standing colossi, four representing Rameses II., and two  his wife, Nefertari. The peristyle and the crypts are lacking (fig. 91),  and the small chambers are placed at either end of the transverse passage,  instead of being parallel with the sanctuary. The hypostyle hall, however,  is supported by six Hathor-headed pillars. Where space permitted, the rock-  cut temple was but partly excavated in the cliff, the forepart being  constructed outside with blocks cut and dressed, and becoming half grotto,  half building. In the hemi-speos at Derr, the peristyle is external to the  cliff; at Beit el Wally, the pylon and court are built; at Gerf Husein and  Wady Sabuah, pylon, court, and hypostyle hall are all outside the mountain,  The most celebrated and original hemi-speos is that built by Queen  Hatshepsut, at Deir el Bahari, in the Theban necropolis (fig. 92),[19] The  sanctuary and chapels which, as usual, accompany it, were cut about 100 ft.  above the level of the valley. In order to arrive at that height, slopes  were made and terraces laid out according to a plan which was not  understood until the site was thoroughly excavated.    Between the hemi-speos and the isolated temple, the Egyptians created yet  another variety, namely, the built temple backed by, but not carried into,  the cliff. The temple of the sphinx at Gizeh, and the temple of Seti I. at  Abydos, may be cited as two good examples. I have already described the  former; the area of the latter (fig. 93) was cleared in a narrow and  shallow belt of sand, which here divides the plain from the desert. It was  sunk up to the roof, the tops of the walls but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14403"],[0,"1001 Questions and Answers on Orthography and Reading (#13)"],[1,"and pleasure, and then sank exhausted at his new patron's  feet and slept.    8. Among the other passengers was a magazine contributor, writing  vagaries of Indian literature, also two physicians, a somber,  irrevocable, irrefragable allopathist, and a genial homeopathist,  who made a specialty of bronchitis. Two peremptory attorneys from the  Legislature of Iowa were discussing the politics of the epoch and the  details of national finance, while a wan, dolorous person, wearing  concave glasses, alternately ate troches and almonds for a sedative,  and sought condolence in a high, lamentable treble from a lethargic  and somewhat deaf and enervate comrade not yet acclimated.    9. Near three exemplary brethren (probably sinecurists) sat a group  of humorous youths; and a jocose sailor (lately from Asia) in a blouse  waist and tarpaulin hat was amusing his patriotic, juvenile listeners  by relating a series of the most extraordinary legends extant,  suggested by the contents of the knapsack which he was calmly and  leisurely arranging in a pyramidal form on a three-legged stool. Above  swung figured placards, with museum and lyceum advertisements, too  verbose to be misconstrued.    10. A mature matron of medium height, and her comely daughter, soon  entered the car, and took seats in front of Winthrop (who recalled  having seen them on Tuesday, in February, in the parquet of a  theater). The young lady had recently made her debut into society at a  musical soiree at her aunt's. She had an exquisite bouquet of flowers  that exhaled sweet perfume. She said to her parent, \"Mamma, shall we  ever find my lost Leicester?\"    11. Geoffrey immediately addressed her, saying, as he presented his  card--    \"Pardon my apparent intrusiveness; but, prithee, have you lost a pet  dog?\"    12. The explanation that he had been stolen was scarcely necessary,  for Leicester, just awakening, vehemently expressed his inexplicable  joy by buoyantly vibrating between the two like the sounding lever  used in telegraphy (for to neither of them would he show partiality),  till, succumbing to ennui, he purported to take a recess, and sat on  his haunches, complaisantly contemplating his friends. It was truly an  interesting picture.    13. They reached their destination ere the sun was beneath the  horizon. Often during the summer Winthrop gallantly rowed from the  quay, with the naive and blithe Beatrice in her jaunty yachting suit,  but no coquetry shone from the depths of her azure eyes. Little Less,  their jocund confidante and courier (and who was as sagacious as a  spaniel), always attended them on these occasions, and whene'er they  rambled through the woodland paths. While the band played strains  from Beethoven Mendelssohn, Bach and others, they promenaded the long  corridors of the hotel. And one evening, as Beatrice lighted the gas  by the etagere in her charming boudoir in their suite of rooms, there  glistened brilliantly a valuable solitaire diamond on her finger.    14. Let us look into the future for the sequel to perfect this  romance, and around a cheerful hearth we see again Geoffrey and  Beatrice, who are paying due homage to their tiny friend Leicester.      SELECT READING.    1. A sacrilegious son of Belial, who suffered from bronchitis and  diphtheria, and had taken much morphine and quinine, having exhausted  his finances, in order to make good the deficit, resolved to ally  himself to a complaisant, lenient, docile, young woman of the  Caucasian race. Buying a calliope, a coral necklace, an illustrated  magazine, and a falcon from Asia, he took a suite of rooms, whose  acoustic properties were excellent, and engaged a Malay as his  coadjutor.    2. Being of an epicurean disposition, he threw the culinary department  of his hotel into confusion by ordering for his dinner vermicelli  soup, a bologna sausage, anchovies, calf's brains fried, and half  a gooseberry pie. For the resulting dyspepsia he took acetic and  tartaric acid, according to allopathy, and when his aunt, a fair  matron of six decades, called, he was tyrannic and combative, and  laughed like a brigand until she was obliged to succumb to his  contumacy.    3. Etiquette being thus annihilated, he became amenable to tenderer  passions. He sent a letter, inviting his inamorata to a matinee,  together with an eighteen-carat gold ring. She revolted at the idea of  accompanying him, and sent a note full of piquant raillery, which led  her suitor to procure a carbine and a sword, with some apparatus, and  to declare that he would not forge hymeneal chains upon any one.    4. So proceeding to an isolated spot, without comrades, he severed  his jugular vein, and discharged the carbine into his abdomen. When  inquiry was made, he was found dead, and the coroner sat on the debris  and did his exact duty, though it was no couch of eider he occupied.    5. Had the misguided youth read Ovid less often, and given precedence  to Hemans and Ingelow, his fate might have been different. True, he  might have hung on a greasy gallows like a highwayman, in squalor, and  been the sport of canines for aye; while now, disarmed by death, he  lies in a splendid mausoleum, far from the wharves and haunts of  men, and can't accent his antepenults, and afford the greatest  discrepancies extant in pronunciation.      SELECT READING--THE BLACKBOARD AND CHALK.      1. Learned sages may reason, the fluent may talk,       But they ne'er can compute what we owe to the chalk.       From the embryo mind of the infant of four,       To the graduate, wise in collegiate lore;       From the old district school-house to Harvard's proud hall,       The chalk rules with absolute sway over all.      2. Go, enter the school-room of primary grade,       And see how conspicuous the blackboard is made.       The teacher makes letters and calls them by name,       And says to the children, \"Now all do the same;\"       Mere infants you see, scarcely able to walk,       But none are too feeble to handle the chalk.      3. We visit the school of much higher pretension,       The blackboard here claims undivided attention;       The walls, dark as Erebus, first greet the eye,       Before them bright misses and lads we espy;       And the sound of the crayon's irregular tappings       Reminds us of spirits' mysterious rappings.      4. One has pictured a vessel, with streamers unfurled,       Another is making a map of the world;       A third has a problem in fractions to solve,       A fourth is explaining how planets revolve;       While a young physiologist, skilled in the art,       Is sketching the muscles, the lungs, and the heart.      5. In the midst of this bustle the school-master stands,       And, lo! he's a crayon in each of his hands;       And the chalk in _his_ hand has a magical power:       A teacher might reason and talk by the hour,       But naught would avail all his reason and talk--       The truth is made plain by the use of the chalk.      6. And the teacher of music the blackboard employs,       The chalk must be used e'en in training the voice;       Be it rhythm or melody, accent or force,       He always insists on the regular course;       Declaring the secret of musical skill       Is found in the blackboard, the chalk, and the drill.      7. See the chalk in the hand of the artist. Behold       What beauteous forms as by magic unfold!       The store-house of Nature he swiftly displays,       Till the dazzled beholder is lost in the maze;       Designs without number appear to the view,       And show what the chalk and the blackboard can do.      8. O wise PESTALOZZI! we place on thy brow       A coronet, bright and unfading; for thou       A legacy rich hast bequeathed unto men:       Our _one_ feeble talent by thee is made _ten_;       We prize thy rare gift, but we never may know       How much to thy matchless invention we owe.      9. O chalk! What a powerful monarch thou art!       In this age of reform how important thy part;       Those minds that are swaying the world unrestrained       In childhood and youth in thy empire were trained.       Of the wonderful power of the press we may talk--       It never can vie with the blackboard and chalk.     10. An engine so powerful, so mighty to aid,       So simple in structure, so readily made,       A helper so potent in training the young--       'Tis meet that thy praise by the muse should be sung;       For though sages may reason, and orators talk,       They can ne'er make their mark without blackboard and chalk.           *       *       *       *       *    THE BURROWS BROTHERS COMPANY,    CLEVELAND, OHIO.           *       *       *       *       *    CHRISTIAN SCIENCE.
