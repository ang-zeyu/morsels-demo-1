Vichy    Outside the hotels, the restaurants attached to which give in most cases  a good _table-d'hote_ dinner for six francs and a _dejeuner_ for four,  there are but few restaurants, for most people who come to Vichy live  _en pension_, making a bargain with their hotel for their food for so  much a day, a bargain which does not encourage them to go outside and  take their meals. The Restauration, in the park close to the Casino, is  a restaurant as well as a cafe, and is amusing in the evening. There are  several small restaurants in the environs of Vichy. In the valleys of  the Sichon and the Jolan, two streams which join near the village of  Cusset and then flow into the Allier, are two little restaurants, each  to be reached by a carriage road. Both the Restaurant les Malavaux near  the ruins, and the Restaurant de l'Ardoisiere near the Cascade of  Gourre-Saillant, have their dishes, each of them making a speciality of  trout and crayfish from the little river that flows hard by. At the  Montagne Verte, whence a fine view of the valley of the Allier is  obtainable, and at one or two other of the places to which walks and  drives are taken, there are cafes and inns where decent food is  obtainable.      Various    Men who know shake their heads when you ask them whether there is good  food obtainable outside the hotels at Royat and La Bourboule, but I have  a pleasant memory of an excellent dinner with good bourgeois cookery at  Hugon's in the Rue Royale of the neighbouring town of Clermont-Ferrand.  At Contrexeville I am told that the wise man finding his food good in  his hotel, returns thanks and does not go prospecting elsewhere.    N.N.-D.          CHAPTER III    BELGIAN TOWNS         The food of the country--Antwerp--Spa--Bruges--Ostende.      I, the Editor, cannot do better in commencing this chapter than to  introduce you to H.L., a _litterateur_ and a \"fin gourmet,\" living in  Belgium, who has written the notes on \"the food of the country\" on  Antwerp and Spa, and to whom I am indebted for the entire succeeding  chapter on the Brussels' restaurants.      The Food of the Country    The Belgian is a big eater and a bird-eater. As a rule, in Belgium the  restaurant that can put forth the longest menu will attract the most  customers. There are people in Brussels who regularly travel out to  Tirlemont, a little Flemish town nearly twenty miles away, to partake of  a famous _table-d'hote_ dinner to which the guests sit down at one  o'clock, and from which they seldom rise before five. The following is a  specimen _carte_ of one of these Gargantuan gorges served in December.                Huitres de Burnham.                Potage Oxtail.        Saumon de Hollande a la Russe.             Bouchees a la Reine.         Chevreuil Diane Chasseresse.         Becasses bardees sur Canape.      Tete de veau en Tortue.        Surprises Grazilla (a Sorbet).         Pluviers dores poire au vin.             Jambonneau au Madere.      Petites feves de Marais a la Creme.          Salmis de Caneton Sauvage.               Faisan de Boheme.               Salade de Saison.           Dinde truffee Mayonnaise.                Glace Vanillee.           Fruits. Gateaux. Dessert.    All this for five francs! with a bottle of Burgundy to wash it down, at  any price from a crown to a pound. One thing that can safely be said  about the Belgian restaurants is that a good bottle of Burgundy can  nearly always be bought in both town and country. It is often told that  the best Burgundy in the world is to be found in Belgian cellars.  Whether this is a reputation maintained in honour of the Dukes of  Burgundy who once ruled the land, or whether the good quality of the  wine is due to the peculiar sandy soil, which permits of an unvarying  temperature in the cellars, I will leave others to determine, but the  fact remains that from a Beaujolais at 2 francs 50 centimes to a  Richebourg at 20 francs, the Burgundy offered to the traveller in  Belgium is generally unimpeachable. Ghent is another town famous for its  big feasts. The market dinner on Friday at the Hotel de la Poste is  often quoted as a marvellous \"spread,\" but the best restaurant in Ghent  is undoubtedly Mottez's, on the Avenue Place d'Armes. This is an  old-fashioned place with no appearance of a restaurant outside, and a  stranger would easily pass it by. Here one dines both _a la carte_ and  at _table-d'hote_; the _table-d'hote_ is well worth trying, though some  of the dishes can be safely passed over. The wines at Mottez's are very  good, and some special old Flemish beer in bottles should be asked for.  A great local dish is _Hochepot Gantois_, a mixture of pork, sausages,  and vegetables which only the very hungry or the very daring should  experiment upon at a strange place. Flemish cooking as a rule is fat and  porky, and there is a dish often seen on the _carte_ called _Choesels a  la Bruxelloise_, which is considered a delicacy by the natives, and it  is supposed to be a hash cooked in sherry or marsala; it is, however, a  dish of mystery. A _plat_ always to be found in Belgium (especially in  the Flanders district), is _Waterzoei de Poulet_, a chicken broth served  with the fowl. This is usually very safe, and any one going to Mottez's  at Ghent should try it there. _Carbonades Flamandes_ is another Flemish  dish which, if well done, can be eaten without fear. This is beef-steak  stewed in \"faro,\" an acid Flemish beer, and served with a rich brown  sauce. _Salade de Princesses Liegeoises_ is a salad made with scarlet  runners mixed with little pieces of fried bacon. The bacon takes the  place of oil, while the vinegar should be used with rather a heavy hand.  When other salads are scarce, this makes a really toothsome dish. Of  all the Belgian _plats_, however, first and foremost must be placed  _Grives a la Namuroise_, which of course are only to be obtained in the  autumn. I have said that the Belgian is a bird-eater, and throughout the  country every species of bird is pressed into service for the table. A  stranger visiting the Ardennes will be struck by the remarkable silence  of the woods, which is caused by the wholesale destruction of the birds.  How the supply is kept up it is difficult to say, but no Belgian dinner  is considered complete without a bird of some sort, and when _grives_  are in season, thousands must be served daily. A _grive_ proper is a  thrush, but I fear that blackbirds and starlings often find their way to  the _casserole_ under the name of a _grive_. They should be cooked with  the trail, in which mountain-ash berries are often found. These give the  bird a peculiar and rather bitter flavour, but the berry that must be  used in the cooking is that of the juniper plant, which grows very  plentifully in Belgium. A traveller through Belgium in the summer or  early autumn should always make a point of ordering _grives_ at a good  restaurant. When _grives_ go out of season, we have woodcock and snipe;  and there are several houses which make a speciality of _Becasses a la  fine Champagne_. At Mons and at Liege, and I think at Charleroi also,  there is every year a woodcock feast, just as there is an oyster feast  at Colchester. At these festivities a little wax candle is placed on the  table beside each guest, so that he can take the head of his _becasse_  and frizzle it in the flame before he attacks its brains. Then we have  plovers and larks in any quantity, but I would not like to vouch for  what are often served as _alouettes_ and _mauviettes_. The one bird that  we never get in Belgium is grouse, unless it is brought over specially  from England or Scotland. It has always been found impossible to rear  grouse in the country. In the neighbourhood of Spa there are great  stretches of moorlands reaching almost to the German frontier, covered  with heather, which look as if they would be the ideal home of the  grouse. Here M. Barry Herrfeldt, of the Chateau du Marteau at Spa, a  real good sportsman, has tried his very utmost to rear grouse; first he  laid down thousands of eggs and set them under partridges, but this  proved a failure; then he introduced young birds, but they all died off,  and I think he has now given up the attempt in despair. Whilst speaking  of partridges, I ought to mention that there is no partridge in the  world so plump and sweet as one shot in the neighbourhood of Louvain,  where they feed on the beetroot cultivated for the sugar factories. At a  restaurant _Coq de bruyere_ is often served as grouse, but this is a  blackcock. One last note: outside the capital and at all but the best  restaurants the Flemish custom is to \"dine\" in the middle of the day and  \"sup\" at about seven.      Antwerp    It is strange that a big city and seaport like Antwerp, which is a  favourite stopping place of English and American visitors to the  Continent, should have so few good restaurants. None of the  establishments near the quays can be classed as even third-rate, and it  is in the neighbourhood of the Bourse that the best eating-houses will  be found. At the Rocher de Cancale, usually called Coulon's (after the  proprietor), the cooking and the wines are everything that can be  desired, but the prices can hardly be called moderate. This restaurant  is situated at the corner of the Place de Meir and the Rue des Douze  Mois, a little street leading down to the Bourse. On the Place de Meir  itself is Bertrand's, another restaurant of the same high character,  which, to the regret of its regular frequenters, is shortly to be  converted into a larger and cheaper establishment. Everything at  Bertrand's has always been first class, and local people who \"knew the  ropes\" could get there an excellent _table-d'hote_ lunch for 3 francs.  This _prix fixe_, however, was not advertised, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18857"],[0,"A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (#13)"],[1,"cific, it may, for aught we know, be still  rising by slow and imperceptible degrees.    If this really be the case, its origin can be attributed to only one  cause--that of the continued action of subterranean fires.    This was a happy thought.    If so, if this were true, away with the theories of Sir Humphry Davy;  away with the authority of the parchment of Arne Saknussemm; the  wonderful pretensions to discovery on the part of my uncle--and to our  journey!    All must end in smoke.    Charmed with the idea, I began more carefully to look about me. A  serious study of the soil was necessary to negative or confirm my  hypothesis. I took in every item of what I saw, and I began to  comprehend the succession of phenomena which had preceded its formation.    Iceland, being absolutely without sedimentary soil, is composed  exclusively of volcanic tufa; that is to say, of an agglomeration of  stones and of rocks of a porous texture. Long before the existence of  volcanoes, it was composed of a solid body of massive trap rock lifted  bodily and slowly out of the sea, by the action of the centrifugal force  at work in the earth.    The internal fires, however, had not as yet burst their bounds and  flooded the exterior cake of Mother Earth with hot and raging lava.    My readers must excuse this brief and somewhat pedantic geological  lecture. But it is necessary to the complete understanding of what  follows.    At a later period in the world's history, a huge and mighty fissure  must, reasoning by analogy, have been dug diagonally from the southwest  to the northeast of the island, through which by degrees flowed the  volcanic crust. The great and wondrous phenomenon then went on without  violence--the outpouring was enormous, and the seething fused matter,  ejected from the bowels of the earth, spread slowly and peacefully in  the form of vast level plains, or what are called mamelons or mounds.    It was at this epoch that the rocks called feldspars, syenites, and  porphyries appeared.    But as a natural consequence of this overflow, the depth of the island  increased. It can readily be believed what an enormous quantity of  elastic fluids were piled up within its centre, when at last it afforded  no other openings, after the process of cooling the crust had taken  place.    At length a time came when despite the enormous thickness and weight of  the upper crust, the mechanical forces of the combustible gases below  became so great, that they actually upheaved the weighty back and made  for themselves huge and gigantic shafts. Hence the volcanoes which  suddenly arose through the upper crust, and next the craters, which  burst forth at the summit of these new creations.    It will be seen that the first phenomena in connection with the  formation of the island were simply eruptive; to these, however, shortly  succeeded the volcanic phenomena.    Through the newly formed openings, escaped the marvelous mass of  basaltic stones with which the plain we were now crossing was covered.  We were trampling our way over heavy rocks of dark grey color, which,  while cooling, had been moulded into six-sided prisms. In the \"back  distance\" we could see a number of flattened cones, which formerly were  so many fire-vomiting mouths.    After the basaltic eruption was appeased and set at rest, the volcano,  the force of which increased with that of the extinct craters, gave free  passage to the fiery overflow of lava, and to the mass of cinders and  pumice stone, now scattered over the sides of the mountain, like  disheveled hair on the shoulders of a Bacchante.    Here, in a nutshell, I had the whole history of the phenomena from which  Iceland arose. All take their rise in the fierce action of interior  fires, and to believe that the central mass did not remain in a state of  liquid fire, white hot, was simply and purely madness.    This being satisfactorily proved (Q.E.D.), what insensate folly to  pretend to penetrate into the interior of the mighty earth!    This mental lecture delivered to myself while proceeding on a journey,  did me good. I was quite reassured as to the fate of our enterprise; and  therefore went, like a brave soldier mounting a bristling battery, to  the assault of old Sneffels.    As we advanced, the road became every moment more difficult. The soil  was broken and dangerous. The rocks broke and gave way under our feet,  and we had to be scrupulously careful in order to avoid dangerous and  constant falls.    Hans advanced as calmly as if he had been walking over Salisbury Plain;  sometimes he would disappear behind huge blocks of stone, and we  momentarily lost sight of him. There was a little period of anxiety and  then there was a shrill whistle, just to tell us where to look for him.    Occasionally he would take it into his head to stop to pick up lumps of  rock, and silently pile them up into small heaps, in order that we might  not lose our way on our return.    He had no idea of the journey we were about to undertake.    At all events, the precaution was a good one; though how utterly useless  and unnecessary--but I must not anticipate.    Three hours of terrible fatigue, walking incessantly, had only brought  us to the foot of the great mountain. This will give some notion of what  we had still to undergo.    Suddenly, however, Hans cried a halt--that is, he made signs to that  effect--and a summary kind of breakfast was laid out on the lava before  us. My uncle, who now was simply Professor Hardwigg, was so eager to  advance, that he bolted his food like a greedy clown. This halt for  refreshment was also a halt for repose. The Professor was therefore  compelled to wait the good pleasure of his imperturbable guide, who did  not give the signal for departure for a good hour.    The three Icelanders, who were as taciturn as their comrade, did not say  a word; but went on eating and drinking very quietly and soberly.    From this, our first real stage, we began to ascend the slopes of the  Sneffels volcano. Its magnificent snowy nightcap, as we began to call  it, by an optical delusion very common in mountains, appeared to me to  be close at hand; and yet how many long weary hours must elapse before  we reached its summit. What unheard-of fatigue must we endure!    The stones on the mountain side, held together by no cement of soil,  bound together by no roots or creeping herbs, gave way continually under  our feet, and went rushing below into the plains, like a series of small  avalanches.    In certain places the sides of this stupendous mountain were at an angle  so steep that it was impossible to climb upwards, and we were compelled  to get round these obstacles as best we might.    Those who understand Alpine climbing will comprehend our difficulties.  Often we were obliged to help each other along by means of our climbing  poles.    I must say this for my uncle, that he stuck as close to me as possible.  He never lost sight of me, and on many occasions his arm supplied me  with firm and solid support. He was strong, wiry, and apparently  insensible to fatigue. Another great advantage with him was that he had  the innate sentiment of equilibrium--for he never slipped or failed in  his steps. The Icelanders, though heavily loaded, climbed with the  agility of mountaineers.    Looking up, every now and then, at the height of the great volcano of  Sneffels, it appeared to me wholly impossible to reach to the summit on  that side; at all events, if the angle of inclination did not speedily  change.    Fortunately, after an hour of unheard-of fatigues, and of gymnastic  exercises that would have been trying to an acrobat, we came to a vast  field of ice, which wholly surrounded the bottom of the cone of the  volcano. The natives called it the tablecloth, probably from some such  reason as the dwellers in the Cape of Good Hope call their mountain  Table Mountain, and their roads Table Bay.    Here, to our mutual surprise, we found an actual flight of stone steps,  which wonderfully assisted our ascent. This singular flight of stairs  was, like everything else, volcanic. It had been formed by one of those  torrents of stones cast up by the eruptions, and of which the Icelandic  name is stina. If this singular torrent had not been checked in its  descent by the peculiar shape of the flanks of the mountain, it would  have swept into the sea, and would have formed new islands.    Such as it was, it served us admirably. The abrupt character of the  slopes momentarily increased, but these remarkable stone steps, a little  less difficult than those of the Egyptian pyramids, were the one simple  natural means by which we were enabled to proceed.    About seven in the evening of that day, after having clambered up two  thousand of these rough steps, we found ourselves overlooking a kind of  spur or projection of the mountain--a sort of buttress upon which the  conelike crater, properly so called, leaned for support.    The ocean lay beneath us at a depth of more than three thousand two  hundred feet--a grand and mighty spectacle. We had reached the region of  eternal snows.    The cold was keen, searching and intense. The wind blew with  extraordinary violence. I was utterly exhausted.    My worthy uncle, the Professor, saw clearly that my legs refused further  service, and that, in fact, I was utterly exhausted. Despite his hot and  feverish impatience, he decided, with a sigh, upon a halt. He called the  eider-duck hunter to his side. That worthy, however, shook his head.    \"Ofvanfor,\" was his sole spoken reply.    \"It appears,\" says my uncle with a woebegone look, \"that we must go  higher.\"    He then turned to Hans, and asked him to give some reason for this  decisive response.    \"Mistour,\" replied the guide.    \"Ja, mistour--yes, the mistour,\" cried one of the Icelandic guides in a  terrified tone.    It was the first time he had spoken.    \"What does this mysterious word signify?\" I"]]]
