Of the last of these there is an interesting account in an Arab writer,  who died in 1034.[1] \"I once entered at night,\" he says, \"into the  principal Christian Church. I found it all strewed with green branches  of myrtle, and planted with cypress trees. The noise of the thundering  bells resounded in my ears; the glare of the innumerable lamps dazzled  my eyes; the priests, decked in rich silken robes of gay and fanciful  colours, and girt with girdle cords, advanced to adore Jesus. Everyone  of those present had banished mirth from his countenance, and expelled  from his mind all agreeable ideas; and if they directed their steps  towards the marble font it was merely to take sips of water with the  hollow of their hands. The priest then rose and stood among them, and  taking the wine cup in his hands prepared to consecrate it: he applied  to the liquor his parched lips, lips as dark as the dusky lips of a  beautiful maid; the fragrancy of its contents captivated his senses, but  when he had tasted the delicious liquor, the sweetness and flavour  seemed to overpower him.\" On leaving the church, the Arab, with true  Arabian facility, extemporized some verses to the following effect: \"By  the Lord of mercy! this mansion of God is pervaded with the smell of  unfermented red liquor, so pleasant to the youth. It was to a girl that  their prayers were addressed, it was for her that they put on their gay  tunics, instead of humiliating themselves before the Almighty.\" Ahmed  also says: \"the priests, wishing us to stay long among them, began to  sing round us with their books in their hands; every wretch presented us  the palm of his withered hand (with the holy water), but they were even  like the bat, whose safety consists in his hatred for light; offering us  every attraction that their drinking of new wine, or their eating of  swine's flesh, could afford.\" This narrative is in many respects very  characteristic of an Arab writer, who would not feel the incongruity of  an illustration on such a theme drawn from \"the lips of a maid,\" or the  irrelevancy of a reference to swine's flesh. But the account merits  attention on other grounds, for it shews how little even the more  intelligent Moslems understood the ceremonies of the religion which they  had conquered, though they might be pardoned for thinking that the  Christians worshipped the Virgin Mary, both because Mohammed himself  fell into the same error, and because probably the Roman Church and its  adherents had already begun to pay her idolatrous worship.    The chief church in Cordova at the conquest seems to have been the  church of St Vincent. On the taking of the town,[2] the Christians had  to give up half of it to the Arabs, a curious arrangement, but one  enforced elsewhere by the Saracens. In 784 the Christians were induced,  or compelled, to sell their half for 100,000 dinars, and it was pulled  down to make room for the Great Mosque.[3] In 894 we find that the  Cordovans were allowed to build a new church.        [1] Ahmed ibn Abdilmalik ibn Shoheyd, Al Makk., i. 246. I quote      De Gayangos' translation.        [2] De Gayangos on Al Makk., i. 368, says the cathedral was at      first guaranteed to the Christians. Some time later than 750      they had to surrender half of it; in 784 they were obliged to      sell the other half, and in return were allowed to rebuild the      destroyed churches. For the \"church of the burnt\" see above, p.      29, note 1.        [3] This was not finished till 793. The original structure cost      80,000 dinars. Several Khalifs added to it, and Hakem II.      (961-976) alone spent on it 160,000 dinars.    Besides these within the walls, there were ten or twelve monasteries and  churches in the immediate neighbourhood of Cordova: among them the  monastery of St Christopher, the famous one of Tabanos, suppressed as  above mentioned, in 854;[1] those of St Felix at Froniano, of St Martin  at Royana, of the Virgin Mary at Cuteclara, of St Salvator at  Pegnamellar; and the churches of SS. Justus and Pastor, and of St  Sebastian.    We have given the names of these churches and monasteries[2] at or near  Cordova, both to shew how numerous they were, and also because from one  or other of them came nearly all the self-devoted martyrs, of whom we  are about to consider the claims. Except in cases like that  above-mentioned, the Christians were not allowed to build new  churches,[3] but considering the diminution in the numbers of the  Christians owing to the conquest, and the apostasy of a great many, this  could not be reckoned a great hardship. Moreover the Christian churches,  it was ordained, should be open to Moslems as well as Christians, though  during the performance of mass it seems that they had to be kept closed.  The Mosques were never to be polluted by the step of an infidel.[4]        [1] Dozy, ii. 162.        [2] Monasteries were established in Spain 150 years before the      Saracen conquest. They mostly fared badly at the hands of the      Arabs, in spite of the injunctions of the Khalif Abubeker (see      Conde, i. 37, and Gibbon), but that of Lorban at Coimbra      received a favourable charter in 734 (Fleury, v. 89; but      Dunham, ii. 154, doubts the authenticity of the charter).        [3] Cp. the stipulation of Omar at the fall of Jerusalem.        [4] See Charter of Coimbra, apud Fleury, v. 89.    The religious ferment, which manifested itself so strongly at Cordova,  did not extend to other parts of Spain. For instance, at Elvira, the  cradle of Spanish Christianity, it was shortly after the Cordovan  martyrdoms (in 864) that the mosque, founded in the year of the  conquest, and left unbuilt for 150 years, was finally finished. What we  hear about the Christians at Elvira at this time is not to their credit,  their bishop, Samuel, being notorious as an evil liver.[1] It is in  Cordova that the main interest at this period centres; and to Cordova we  will for the present confine our attention.    There is abundant evidence to show that the party of enthusiasts, both  those who offered themselves for martyrdom, and those who aided and  abetted their more impulsive brethren, were a comparatively small body  in the Church of Spain; and that their proceedings awakened little short  of dismay in the minds of the more sensible portion of the Christian  community, both in the Arab part of Spain, and perhaps in a less degree  in the free North.[2] The chief leaders of the party of zealots--as far  as we find mention of them--were Saul, bishop of Cordova (850-861),  Eulogius, and Samson, abbot of the monastery of Pegnamellar; while  Reccafredus, bishop of Seville, and Hostegesis of Malaga, were the  prominent ecclesiastics on the other side.        [1] Ibn Khatib, apud Dozy, ii. 210.        [2] Yonge, p. 63.    Before relating what steps the latter took in conjunction with the  Moslem authorities to put down the dangerous outbreak of fanaticism, it  will be interesting to note what was the attitude of the different  sections of the Church towards the misguided men who gave themselves up  to death, and their claims to the crown of martyrdom. Those who denied  the validity of these claims, rested their contention on the grounds,  that the so-called martyrs had compassed their own destruction, there  being no persecution at the time; that they had worked no miracles in  proof of their high claims; that they had been slain by men who believed  in the true God; that they had suffered an easy and immediate death; and  that their bodies had corrupted like those of other men.    It was an abuse of words, said the party of moderation, to call these  suicides by the holy name of martyrs, when no violence in high places  had forced them to deny their faith,[1] or interfered with their due  observance of Christianity. It was merely an act of ostentatious  pride--and pride was the root of all evil--to court danger. Such conduct  had never been enjoined by Christ, and was quite alien from the meekness  and humility of His character.[2]    They might have added that such voluntary martyrdoms had been expressly  condemned,    (_a._) By the circular letter of the Church of Smyrna to the other  churches, describing Polycarp's martyrdom, in the terms: \"We commend not  those who offer themselves of their own accord, for that is not what the  gospel teacheth us:\"[3]    (_b._) By St Cyprian,[4] who, when brought before the consul and  questioned, said \"our discipline forbiddeth that any should offer  themselves of their own accord;\" and in his last letter he says: \"Let  none of you offer himself to the pagans, it is sufficient if he speak  when apprehended:\"    (_c._) By Clement of Alexandria: \"We also blame those who rush to death,  for there are some, not of us, but only bearing the same name, who give  themselves up:\"[5]    (_d._) Implicitly by the synod of Elvira, or Illiberis (_circa_ 305),  one of the canons of which forbade him to be ranked as a martyr, who  was killed on the spot for breaking idols:    (_e._) By Mensurius, bishop of Carthage, who, when consulted on the  question of reducing the immense lists of acknowledged martyrs, gave it  as his opinion that those should be first excluded who had courted  martyrdom.[6] One bishop alone, and he a late one, Benedict XIV. of  Rome,[7] has ventured to approve what the Church has condemned. Nor is  this the only instance in which the Roman Church has set aside the  decisions of an earlier Christendom.        [1] Eul., \"Mem.

One of the men replied that four negroes were on the mow, and he knew of  it. The men then asked us where we were, going. We told them to  Gettysburg, that we had aunts and a mother there. Also we spoke of a Mr.  Houghman, a gentleman we happened to have some knowledge of, having seen  him in Virginia. We were next asked for our passes. We told them that we  hadn't any, that we had not been required to carry them where we came  from. They then said that we would have to go before a magistrate, and  if he allowed us to go on, well and good. The men all being armed and  furnished with ropes, we were ordered to be tied. I told them if they  took me they would have to take me dead or crippled. At that instant one  of my friends cried out--'Where is the man that betrayed us?' Spying him  at the same moment, he shot him (badly wounding him). Then the conflict  fairly began. The constable seized me by the collar, or rather behind my  shoulder. I at once shot him with my pistol, but in consequence of his  throwing up his arm, which hit mine as I fired, the effect of the load  of my pistol was much turned aside; his face, however, was badly burned,  besides his shoulder being wounded. I again fired on the pursuers, but  do not know whether I hit anybody or not. I then drew a sword, I had  brought with me, and was about cutting my way to the door, when I was  shot by one of the men, receiving the entire contents of one load of a  double barreled gun in my left arm, that being the arm with which I was  defending myself. The load brought me to the ground, and I was unable to  make further struggle for myself. I was then badly beaten with guns, &c.  In the meantime, my friend Craven, who was defending himself, was shot  badly in the face, and most violently beaten until he was conquered and  tied. The two young brothers of Craven stood still, without making the  least resistance. After we were fairly captured, we were taken to  Terrytown, which was in sight of where we were betrayed. By this time I  had lost so much blood from my wounds, that they concluded my situation  was too dangerous to admit of being taken further; so I was made a  prisoner at a tavern, kept by a man named Fisher. There my wounds were  dressed, and thirty-two shot were taken from my arm. For three days I  was crazy, and they thought I would die. During the first two weeks,  while I was a prisoner at the tavern, I raised a great deal of blood,  and was considered in a very dangerous condition--so much so that  persons desiring to see me were not permitted. Afterwards I began to get  better, and was then kept privately--was strictly watched day and night.  Occasionally, however, the cook, a colored woman (Mrs. Smith), would  manage to get to see me. Also James Matthews succeeded in getting to see  me; consequently, as my wounds healed, and my senses came to me, I began  to plan how to make another effort to escape. I asked one of the  friends, alluded to above, to get me a rope. He got it. I kept it about  me four days in my pocket; in the meantime I procured three nails. On  Friday night, October 14th, I fastened my nails in under the window  sill; tied my rope to the nails, threw my shoes out of the window, put  the rope in my mouth, then took hold of it with my well hand, clambered  into the window, very weak, but I managed to let myself down to the  ground. I was so weak, that I could scarcely walk, but I managed to  hobble off to a place three quarters of a mile from the tavern, where a  friend had fixed upon for me to go, if I succeeded in making my escape.  There I was found by my friend, who kept me secure till Saturday eve,  when a swift horse was furnished by James Rogers, and a colored man  found to conduct me to Gettysburg. Instead of going direct to  Gettysburg, we took a different road, in order to shun our pursuers, as  the news of my escape had created general excitement. My three other  companions, who were captured, were sent to Westminster jail, where they  were kept three weeks, and afterwards sent to Baltimore and sold for  twelve hundred dollars a piece, as I was informed while at the tavern in  Terrytown.\"    [Illustration: DESPERATE CONFLICT IN A BARN.]    The Vigilance Committee procured good medical attention and afforded the  fugitive time for recuperation, furnished him with clothing and a free  ticket, and sent him on his way greatly improved in health, and strong  in the faith that, \"He who would be free, himself must strike the blow.\"  His safe arrival in Canada, with his thanks, were duly announced. And  some time after becoming naturalized, in one of his letters, he wrote  that he was a brakesman on the Great Western R.R., (in Canada--promoted  from the U.G.R.R.,) the result of being under the protection of the  British Lion.             *       *       *       *       *          DEATH OF ROMULUS HALL--NEW NAME GEORGE WEEMS.      In March, 1857, Abram Harris fled from John Henry Suthern, who lived  near Benedict, Charles county, Md., where he was engaged in the farming  business, and was the owner of about seventy head of slaves. He kept an  overseer, and usually had flogging administered daily, on males and  females, old and young. Abram becoming very sick of this treatment,  resolved, about the first of March, to seek out the Underground Rail  Road. But for his strong attachment to his wife (who was owned by Samuel  Adams, but was \"pretty well treated\"), he never would have consented to  suffer as he did.    Here no hope of comfort for the future seemed to remain. So Abram  consulted with a fellow-servant, by the name of Romulus Hall, alias  George Weems, and being very warm friends, concluded to start together.  Both had wives to \"tear themselves from,\" and each was equally ignorant  of the distance they had to travel, and the dangers and sufferings to be  endured. But they \"trusted in God\" and kept the North Star in view. For  nine days and nights, without a guide, they traveled at a very  exhausting rate, especially as they had to go fasting for three days,  and to endure very cold weather. Abram's companion, being about fifty  years of age, felt obliged to succumb, both from hunger and cold, and  had to be left on the way. Abram was a man of medium size, tall, dark  chestnut color, and could read and write a little and was quite  intelligent; \"was a member of the Mount Zion Church,\" and occasionally  officiated as an \"exhorter,\" and really appeared to be a man of genuine  faith in the Almighty, and equally as much in freedom.    In substance, Abram gave the following information concerning his  knowledge of affairs on the farm under his master--    \"Master and mistress very frequently visited the Protestant Church, but  were not members. Mistress was very bad. About three weeks before I  left, the overseer, in a violent fit of bad temper, shot and badly  wounded a young slave man by the name of Henry Waters, but no sooner  than he got well enough he escaped, and had not been heard of up to the  time Abram left. About three years before this happened, an overseer of  my master was found shot dead on the road. At once some of the slaves  were suspected, and were all taken to the Court House, at Serentown, St.  Mary's county; but all came off clear. After this occurrence a new  overseer, by the name of John Decket, was employed. Although his  predecessor had been dead three years, Decket, nevertheless, concluded  that it was not 'too late' to flog the secret out of some of the slaves.  Accordingly, he selected a young slave man for his victim, and flogged  him so cruelly that he could scarcely walk or stand, and to keep from  being actually killed, the boy told an untruth, and confessed that he  and his Uncle Henry killed Webster, the overseer; whereupon the poor  fellow was sent to jail to be tried for his life.\"    But Abram did not wait to hear the verdict. He reached the Committee  safely in this city, in advance of his companion, and was furnished with  a free ticket and other needed assistance, and was sent on his way  rejoicing. After reaching his destination, he wrote back to know how his  friend and companion (George) was getting along; but in less than three  weeks after he had passed, the following brief story reveals the sad  fate of poor _Romulus Hall_, who had journeyed with him till exhausted  from hunger and badly frost-bitten.    A few days after his younger companion had passed on North, Romulus was  brought by a pitying stranger to the Vigilance Committee, in a most  shocking condition. The frost had made sad havoc with his feet and legs,  so much so that all sense of feeling had departed therefrom.    [Illustration: DEATH OF ROMULUS HALL.]    How he ever reached this city is a marvel. On his arrival medical  attention and other necessary comforts were provided by the Committee,  who hoped with himself, that he would be restored with the loss of his  toes alone. For one week he seemed to be improving; at the expiration of  this time, however, his symptoms changed, indicating not only the end of  slavery, but also the end of all his earthly troubles.    Lockjaw and mortification set in in the most malignant form, and for  nearly thirty-six hours the unfortunate victim suffered in extreme  agony, though not a murmur escaped him for having brought upon himself  in seeking his liberty this painful infliction and death. It was  wonderful to see how resignedly he endured his fate.    Being anxious to get his testimony relative to his escape, etc., the  Chairman of the Committee took his pencil and expressed to him his  wishes in the matter. Amongst other questions, he was asked: \"Do you  regret having attempted to escape from slavery?\" After a severe spasm he  said, as his friend was about to turn to leave the room, hopeless of  being gratified in his purpose: \"Don't go; I have not answered your  question. I am glad I escaped from slavery!\" He then gave his name, and  tried to tell the"]]]
