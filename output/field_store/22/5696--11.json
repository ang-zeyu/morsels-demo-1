I say, aren't you  fearfully hungry? I'm literally starving. Let's find a confectioner's  and each buy a bun before we go.\"    Both Beatrice and Ingred felt that they required fortifying before they  started for home, so they dived into the nearest pastry-cook's and  demanded buns. They were eating them rather hastily, when Linda Slater  entered the shop in company with a gentleman, evidently her father. She  hailed her class-mates, and at once began to talk over the match and  rejoice at the school victory.    \"Who says we're no good at games now? This has sent up our credit ten  per cent! I'm proud of the Coll.!\"    \"Blossom was A1,\" exulted Verity.    \"And Janie was simply ripping. Dad thought no end of her. Didn't you,  Dad?\"    \"Well, I'm glad we made something of a record,\" admitted Ingred.    \"I say,\" declared Beatrice, hastily finishing her bun, \"if that clock's  right, we must bolt for our train.\"    \"As a matter of fact, it's one minute slow,\" exclaimed Linda, consulting  her watch. \"You'll have to sprint.\"    \"Aren't _you_ coming?\"    \"No, we have our car here. It's outside.\"    \"Those girls will hardly catch their train,\" remarked Mr. Slater to  Linda, as the three went to the pay desk to settle for their buns.  \"Couldn't we stow them into the car, and take them along with us?\"    \"Oh, no, Dad!\" frowned Linda. \"There really isn't room. You promised  you'd call at Brantbury and bring Gerald and Eustace back for the  afternoon. We couldn't cram them all in the car!\"    \"There isn't time for them to get the train.\"    \"Oh, yes! You don't know how they can run!\"    Quite unaware of the kindly offer which had been rejected on their  behalf, Beatrice, Verity, and Ingred fled from the shop, and hurried  with all possible speed in the direction of the railway station. They  could see the train coming along the top of the embankment, and it had  drawn up at the platform before they reached the passenger entrance.  They were not the only late comers. It was Saturday, and a crowd of work  people from various factories near were returning to Grovebury.    In company with a very mixed and motley crew they pushed their way up  the long flight of steps. A collector stood at the top, and just as they  were nearing their goal, he slammed the gate and refused further  admission to the platform. They could hear the whistle, and the general  bumping of chains that betokened the starting of the carriages. They  were exactly half a minute too late! When the train was well out of the  station, the collector once more opened his barrier, and the crowd  surged on. The three girls, who disliked pushing among a rough assembly,  stood on one side to let the people pass by. There was no hurry now, and  no object to be gained by forcing their way ahead. Last of all,  therefore, they presented themselves at the gate.    \"Tickets, please!\" repeated the collector automatically.    All three felt in their pockets, but felt in vain. Return tickets and  purses were alike missing, and even penknives and handkerchiefs had  vanished, Ingred's pocket, indeed, was neatly turned inside out. Here  was a dilemma! They had evidently been robbed on the stairs by a  professional thief, who had appropriated all their portable belongings.  In utter consternation they looked at one another.    \"We've lost our tickets!\" faltered Beatrice.    \"They've been stolen!\" added Ingred.    \"Do please let us through!\" entreated Verity.    In ordinary circumstances the collector would no doubt have listened to  the girl's story, and taken them to interview the station-master, but  to-day he had to do double duty, and could scarcely cope with the extra  work. He had to deal with crowds, and to keep a sharp eye to see that no  one defrauded the railway company by travelling without paying the fare.  A train was due at the next moment on the other side of the platform,  and his services were urgently required at the opposite exit.    \"Haven't you got your tickets?\" he demanded curtly. \"Then I must close  the gate. No one's allowed on the platform without tickets.\"    The advancing train whistled as it ran through the cutting, and,  disregarding the girls' remonstrances, the official locked the barrier.  He bolted across the line in front of the engine, just in time to take  his place at the other gateway before the rush of passengers began, and  probably never gave another thought to the three whom he had just  excluded. Left shut out on the top of the station steps, the unlucky  trio ruefully reviewed the situation.    \"What _are_ we to do?\" demanded Ingred breathlessly.    \"Goodness only knows!\" sighed Verity.    \"We're in a very awkward fix!\" admitted Beatrice.    They were much too far from Grovebury to make walking possible.    \"I wonder Miss Giles didn't miss us!\" fretted Verity, trying to throw  the blame on somebody.    \"It isn't her fault--fair play to her!\" urged Beatrice. \"She wasn't  looking after us officially to-day, you know. On Saturdays we're  supposed to be on our own.\"    \"I lay the blame on buns!\" said Ingred. \"We'd have kept with the rest of  the school if we hadn't stopped at that confectioner's.\"    \"Well, it's no use crying over spilt milk now! What we've got to do is  to find some means of getting home. We can't stay here all day.\"    \"I believe it's not very far to Waverley from Denscourt,\" ventured  Beatrice. \"If we can manage to walk, I know some people who live at a  house there. I'd ask them to lend us our fares, and we could catch a  train at Waverley station.\"    The idea seemed feasible, and, as it was the only one that suggested  itself, they unanimously decided to adopt it. They walked down the steps  again, therefore, on to the high road, and, stopping a girl who was  passing, asked the way to Waverley.    \"It's a good four miles by the road, but it's only about two by the  fields,\" she volunteered in reply. \"I think you'd find the path. You go  down the road to the right, and turn through the first gate across a  field to a farm. Then you keep along the river bank, on the left. You  can't miss it.\"    To save two miles in their present predicament was a matter of  importance, and they all felt that they would greatly prefer walking  through fields to tramping along a dusty high road. Thanking their  informant, they took her advice, and set off in the direction which she  indicated. After all, the affair was rather an adventure.    \"The Mortons are sure to offer us lunch when we get there,\" affirmed  Beatrice; \"of course we shall be fearfully late home, and our people  will be getting very anxious about us, but we can't help that. I was to  have gone to a matinee of _Carmen_ this afternoon, but it's off,  naturally! I expect Doris will use my ticket, when I don't turn up.\"    \"I meant to wash our dog when I got back!\" laughed Ingred. \"He'll have  to look dirty on Sunday, now.\"    \"And I meant to do a hundred things; but what's the use of talking about  them now?\" groaned Verity. \"Here's our farm, and that appears to be the  river over there. Didn't that girl say: 'Keep along to the left'?  Perhaps we'd better ask again.\"    They verified their instructions from a boy who was standing in the  farmyard, whittling a stick, and trudged away over a stubble field and  through a turnstile gate. It was quite pretty along the path by the  river. There was a tall hedge where hips and haws showed red, and a  grassy border where a few wild flowers still bloomed. The sun shed a  soft golden autumnal haze over the fields and bushes and the lines of  yellow trees.    The girls rather enjoyed themselves; it was an unexpected country  excursion, and had all the charm of novelty. They walked about half a  mile, chatting about school matters as they went, then suddenly they  were confronted by an alternative. A bridge spanned the river, and the  broad, well-trodden path along which they had come turned over the  bridge. There was indeed a track that continued along the left bank, but  it was over-grown, and looked little used. Which were they to take?    That was a question which required discussion.    \"The girl said: 'keep along the river bank on the left,'\" urged Ingred.    \"Yet the path so plainly goes across here,\" demurred Verity.    \"That's certainly the left bank, but that way looks as if it led to  nowhere,\" vacillated Beatrice.    \"Can't we ask anybody?\"    \"There isn't a soul in sight.\"    \"Isn't there a signpost?\"    \"Nothing of the sort.\"    \"Then which way _shall_ we go?\"    \"Better take votes on it.\"    \"Right-o! I'm for 'bypath meadow.'\"    \"And I'm for the 'king's highway.'\"    \"So am I, so we're two to one!\"    \"I'll give in, then,\" said Ingred, \"only I've a sort of feeling we're  going wrong, all the same!\"    The new path led along the opposite bank, and was very much a replica of  the former. It ran on and on for what seemed quite a long distance, but  they met nobody from whom they could inquire the way. For nearly a  quarter of a mile a belt of trees obscured the view, and when at last  the prospect could once more be seen, Beatrice stopped short with a  groan of despair. On the other side of the water was the unmistakable  spire of Waverley church.    \"We've come wrong, after all!\"    \"Oh, good night! So we have!\"    \"What an absolute swindle!\"    The girls were certainly not in luck that day. They had missed their  path as effectually as they had missed their train. The chimneys of  Waverley were in sight, but separated from them by a wide stream, and  unless they were prepared to wade, swim, or fly, there was no way of  reaching the village.    \"There's nothing for it but to turn back!\"    \"Why, but that's _miles_!\"    \"Are you sure it's Waverley over there? Can we ask anybody?\"    \"No one to ask, worse luck!\"    \"Yes, there is! I can see some people coming along in a boat.\"    Rendered desperate by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18525"],[0,"On the Trail: An Outdoor Book for Girls (#13)"],[1,"brim and down over top of shoulders, about            twenty-two inches or more in all. Cut the net            according to size needed; then fold the strip at            centre across the width, fold again, making four            even folds. Once more fold and you will have            divided the net into eight equal parts. Mark the            net at each fold and open it out (Fig. 30). Cut            armholes in the divisions marked 2 (Fig. 30) to            fit over the shoulders, sew together the two ends,            bind the shoulder armholes holding the net loosely            that it may not pull and strain. Sew an elastic to            back corner of each armhole, hem the top of net            strip and run an elastic through hem to fit snugly            on base of hat crown. Gather lower edges of net;            then try the net on, adjusting lower and upper            gathers so that the veil will blouse a little,            remembering not to let the net touch your face; if            it should, the little tormentors will bite through            and torture you. Sew a piece of black tape across            lower edge of the front and another across lower            edge of the back, fitting the tape to lie smoothly            over chest and back; then bring forward the            hanging pieces of elastic, adjust them comfortably            under the arms, and mark length of elastic to            reach around under arm and fasten with dress snaps            at front corner of armhole. Cut elastic and finish            net (Fig. 31).              _Ornaments_--Never take rings, bracelets,            necklaces, or jewelry of any kind to camp; leave            all such things at home, and with them ribbons,            beads, and ornaments of all descriptions.    [Illustration: 30    31    The head-net and blanket-roll.]      =Check List of Toilet Articles=              One comb, not silver-backed.              One hand-mirror to hang or stand up.              One tooth-brush in case.              One tube of tooth-paste, or its equivalent.              One nail-brush.              One cake of unscented toilet-soap.              Two cakes of laundry-soap.              One package of borax or securely corked bottle of            ammonia.              One tube of cold-cream.              One baking-powder can of pure, freshly \"tried out\"            mutton tallow, made so by boiling in pure water            until melted, then allowed to cool and harden.            When taken from the water, again melted and, while            hot, strained through a clean cloth into the can.            Good to remove pitch and balsam-gum from the            hands, to use as cold-cream to soften the hands,            and excellent to water-proof the shoes.              One wash-cloth, washed, aired, and sunned every            day. In rainy weather, washed and dried.              Two hand towels, each washed as soon as soiled.              One bath towel, washed as soon as used.              One manicure-scissors.              One package sandpaper nail-files.              Two papers of hair-pins.              One paper of common pins, also little flat pocket            pincushion well filled around edge with pins.              Two papers of large-sized safety-pins.      =Check List of Personal Camp Property=              One note-book and pencil for taking notes on wild            birds, animals, trees, etc.              One needle-case, compact with needles and strong            white and black thread, wound on cardboard reels            (spools are too bulky). Scissors, thimble, and            large-eyed tape-needle for running elastic through            hem in bloomers and head-net, when needed.              Two papers of very large sized safety-pins of            horse-blanket kind.              One roll of tape, most useful in many ways.              One whistle, the loudest and shrillest to be            found, worn on cord around the neck, for calling            help when lost or in case of need. A short, simple            system of signalling calls should be adopted.              One compass, durable and absolutely true.              One watch, inexpensive but trustworthy. Do not            take your gold watch.              One package of common post-cards, with lead pencil            attached. The postals to take the place of            letters.              One package writing-paper and stamped envelopes,            if post-cards do not meet the needs.              One pocket-knife, a big, strong one, with            substantial, sharp, strong blades, for outdoor            work and to use at meals.              One loaded camera, in case which has secure            leather loops through which your belt can be            slipped to carry camera and hold it steady,            leaving the hands free and precluding danger of            smashing the instrument should a misstep on mossy            stone or a trip over unseen vine or root suddenly            throw you down and send the camera sailing on a            distance ahead. Such an accident befell a girl            camper who was too sure that her precious camera            would be safest if carried in her hand. Wear the            camera well back that you may not fall on it            should you stumble, or the camera can be carried            on strap slung from the right shoulder.              Three or more rolls of extra films, the quantity            depending upon your length of stay at camp and the            possibilities for interesting subjects.              One fishing-rod and fishing-tackle outfit. Choose            the simple and useful rather than the fancy and            expensive. Select your outfit according to the            particular kind of fishing you will find near            camp. There is a certain different style of rod            and tackle for almost every variety of fish. If            fishing is not to be a prominent feature of the            camp, you might take line and hooks, and wait            until you reach camp to cut your fishing-pole.              One tin cup, with open handle to slide over belt.            The cup will serve you with cool sparkling water,            with cocoa, coffee, or tea as the case may be, and            it will also be your soup bowl. Keep the inside of            the cup bright and shiny. While aluminum is much            lighter than other metal, it is not advisable to            take to camp either cup, teaspoon, or fork of            aluminum because it is such a good conductor of            heat that those articles would be very apt to burn            your lips if used with hot foods.              One dinner knife, if you object to using your            pocket-knife.              One dinner fork, not silver.              One teaspoon, not silver.              One plate, may be of aluminum or tin, can be kept            bright by scouring with soap and earth.              Two warm wool double blankets, closely woven and            of good size. The U.S. Army blankets are of the            best. With safety-pins blankets can be turned into            sleeping-bags and hammocks.              One poncho, light in weight to wear over            shoulders, spread on ground rubber side down to            protect from dampness, can be used in various            ways.              One pillow-bag.              One mattress-bag.              One water-proof match-safe.              One belt hatchet in case, or belt sheath small            axe, for chopping wood and felling small trees,            but, be very careful when using either of these            tools. Before going to camp find some one who can            give you proper instructions in handling one or            both, and practise carefully following directions.            Be very _cautious_ and go slow until you become an            expert. Outdoor books and magazines should be            consulted for information, and if you do not feel            absolutely confident of your ability to use the            hatchet or axe after practising, _do not take them            with you_. For the sake of others as well as            yourself, you have not the right to take chances            of injuring either others or yourself through            inability to use safely any tool. Do not attempt            to use a regular-sized axe, it is very dangerous.            One guide told me that after a tenderfoot chopped            a cruel gash nearly through his foot when using            the guide's axe, that axe was never again loaned,            but kept in a safe place and not allowed to be            touched by any one except the owner.      =Check List for First Aid=              One hot-water bag, good for all pains and aches,            and a comfort when one is chilly.              One package pure ginger pulverized or ground, to            make hot ginger tea in case of chill, pains in the            bowels, or when you have met with an accidental            ducking or are wet through to the skin by rain.            Never mind if the tea does burn, ginger always            stings when helping one. Be a good sport, take            your medicine.              One box of charcoal tablets for dyspepsia or            indigestion.              One package bicarbonate of soda (baking-soda);            good for burns, sprinkle well with soda, see that            the burn is completely covered, then cover lightly            with cloth, and do not disturb it for a long time.              One bottle of ammonia well corked. Tie the cork            down firmly in the bottle (Fig. 32); a flannel            case or raffia covering will protect the glass            from breakage. Good to smell in case of faintness,            but care must be taken _not_ to hold it _too near_            the _nose_, as the ammonia might injure the            delicate membranes, "]]]
