It was not till five years after Selim's death that Mecca  acknowledged the Ottoman Caliphate.    [11] The original diary of Lascaris, Napoleon's agent with the Arabs,  has, I understand, within the last two years been discovered at Aleppo  and purchased by the French Government. Its publication, whenever that  may be decided on, will, if I am not quite mistaken, throw new and  important light on Napoleon's Egyptian career.    [12] The _Jawaib_ was first started about the year 1860.    [13] In the recent trial of the murderers of Abd el Aziz, Abd el Hamid  has departed from his usual adherence to the Sheriat. It is a lapsus  which may one day be taken hold of against him, should the Ulema need to  depose him. He is said to have yielded to the advice of an European  confidant who directs the details of his diplomacy with Europe.          CHAPTER III.    THE TRUE METROPOLIS--MECCA.      In the last chapter the position of the Ottoman Sultans towards the mass  of Orthodox Islam was sketched, and the foundations were shown on which  their tenure of the Caliphal title rested. These I explained to be  neither very ancient nor very securely laid in the faith and affections  of the faithful; and, though at the present moment a certain reaction in  favour of Constantinople had set in, it was due to accidental  circumstances, which are unlikely to become permanent, and was very far  indeed from being universal. It may be as well to recapitulate the  position.    The Sunite or Orthodox Mohammedan world holds it as a dogma of faith  that there must be a Khalifeh, the ex-officio head of their religious  polity, and the successor of their prophet. In temporal matters, whoever  holds this office is theoretically king of all Islam; and in spiritual  matters he is their supreme religious authority. But, practically, the  Caliph's temporal jurisdiction has for many centuries been limited to  such lands as he could hold by arms; while in spiritual matters he has  exercised no direct authority whatever. Nevertheless, he represents to  Mussulmans something of which they are in need, and which they are bound  to respect; and it cannot be doubted that in proper hands, and at the  proper moment, the Caliphate might once more become an instrument for  good or evil of almost universal power in Islam. Even now, were there to  be an apprehension of general and overwhelming danger for religion, it  is to the Caliph that the faithful would look to defend their interests;  and, as we have seen, a moderate show of piety and respect for the  sacred law has been sufficient, in spite of a violent political  opposition, to secure for the actual holder of the title a degree of  sympathy which no other Mussulman prince could at any cost of good  government have obtained.    On the other hand, it has been shown that the loyalty, such as there is,  which Abd el Hamid inspires is due to him solely as incumbent of the  Caliphal office, and not as the representative of any race or dynasty.  The House of Othman, as such, represents nothing sacred to Mussulmans;  and the Turkish race is very far from being respected in Islam. The  present Caliphal house is unconnected in blood with the old traditional  line of \"successors;\" and even with the Turks themselves inspires little  modern reverence. Moreover, the actual incumbent of the office is  thought to be not even a true Ottoman, being the offspring of the  Seraglio rather than of known parents; Abd el Hamid's sole title to  spiritual consideration is his official name. This he has had the sense  to set prominently forward. Reduced to a syllogism, Mussulman loyalty  may be read thus: There must be a Caliph, and the Caliphate deserves  respect; there is no other Caliph but Abd el Hamid; ergo, Abd el Hamid  deserves respect.    It has been pointed out, however, that, if the Sultan's recent revival  of spiritual pretensions is his present strength, it may also in the  immediate future become his weakness. The challenge which the  Constantinople school of Hanefism threw down ten years ago to the world  has been taken up; and all the learned world now knows the frailty of  the House of Othman's spiritual position. The true history of the  Caliphate has been published and set side by side with that Turkish  history which the ignorance of a previous generation had come to  confound with it. At the present day nobody with any instruction doubts  that Abd el Hamid and his house might be legally displaced by the first  successful rival, and that the only right of Constantinople to lead  Islam is the right of the sword. As long as the Ottoman Empire is  maintained and no counter Caliph appears, so long will the Sultan be the  acknowledged head of religion; but not a day longer. The Caliphate, for  one alien as Abd el Hamid is to the Koreysh, must be constantly  maintained in arms, and on the first substantial success of a new  pretender his present following would fall off from him without  compunction, transferring to this last their loyalty on precisely the  same ground on which Abd el Hamid now receives it. Abd el Hamid would  then be legitimately deposed and disappear, for it is unlikely that he  would find any such protector in his adversity as the legitimate Caliphs  found in theirs six hundred years ago. So fully is this state of things  recognized by the Ulema, that I found the opinion last year to be nearly  universal that Abd el Hamid was destined to be the last Caliph of the  House of Othman.    It becomes, therefore, a question of extreme interest to consider who  among Mussulman princes could, with any chance of being generally  accepted by orthodox Islam, put in a claim to replace the Ottoman  dynasty as Caliph when the day of its doom shall have been reached. It  is a question which ought certainly to interest Englishmen, for on its  solution the whole problem of Mussulman loyalty or revolt in India most  probably depends, and though it would certainly be unwise, at the  present moment, for an English Government to obtrude itself violently in  a religious quarrel not yet ripe, much might be done in a perfectly  legitimate way to influence the natural course of events and direct it  to a channel favourable to British interests.    Is there then in Islam, east, or west, or south, a man of sufficient  eminence and courage to proclaim himself Caliph, in the event of Abd el  Hamid's political collapse or death? What would be his line of action to  secure Mahommedan acceptance? Where should he fix his capital, and on  what arms should he rely? Whose flag should he display? Above all--for  this is the question that interests us most--could such a change of  rulers affect favourably the future thought and life of Islam, and lead  to an honest Moslem reformation? These questions, which are being  cautiously asked of each other by thoughtful Mussulmans in every corner  of the east, I now propose to consider and, as far as it is in my power,  to answer.    I have said that Islam is already well prepared for change. Whatever  Europeans may think of a future for the Ottoman Empire, Mussulmans are  profoundly convinced that on its present basis it will not long survive.  Even in Turkey, the thought of its political regeneration as an European  Empire has been at last abandoned, and no one now contemplates more than  a few years further tenure of the Bosphorus. Twenty years ago it was not  so, nor perhaps five, but to-day all are resigned to this.    Ancient prophecy and modern superstition alike point to a return of the  Crescent into Asia as an event at hand, and to the doom of the Turks as  a race which has corrupted Islam. A well-known prediction to this  effect, which has for ages exercised its influence on the vulgar and  even the learned Mohammedan mind, gives the year 1883 of our era as the  term within which these things are to be accomplished, and places the  scene of the last struggle in Northern Syria, at Homs, on the Orontes.  Islam is then finally to retire from the north, and the Turkish rule to  cease. Such prophecies often work their own fulfilment, and the feeling  of a coming catastrophe is so deeply rooted and so universal that I  question whether the proclamation of a Jehad by the Sultan would now  induce a thousand Moslems to fight voluntarily against the Cross in  Europe.    The Sultan himself and the old Turkish party which supports him, while  clinging obstinately in appearance to all their ground, really have  their eyes turned elsewhere than on Adrianople and Salonica and the city  of the Roman Emperors. It is unlikely that a new advance of the  Christian Powers from the Balkan would meet again with more than formal  opposition; and Constantinople itself, unsupported by European aid,  would be abandoned without a blow, or with only such show of resistance  as the Sheriat requires for a cession of territory.[14] The Sultan  would, in such an event, pass into Asia, and I have been credibly  informed that his own plan is to make not Broussa, but Bagdad or  Damascus his capital. This he considers would be more in conformity with  Caliphal traditions, and the Caliphate would gain strength by a return  to its old centres. Damascus is surnamed by theologians _Bab el Kaaba_,  Gate of the Caaba; and there or at Bagdad, the traditional city of the  Caliphs, he would build up once more a purely theocratic empire.    Such, they say, is his thought; and such doubtless would be the empire  of the future that Mussulmans would choose. Only it is improbable that  it would continue to be in any sense Ottoman, or that Abd el Hamid would  have the opportunity of himself establishing it. The loss of  Constantinople would be a blow to his prestige he could not well recover  from, and no new empire ever yet was founded on defeat. What is far more  likely to happen is that, in such an event, Abd el Hamid and his house  would disappear, and an entirely new order of Caliphal"]]]
