[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14555"],[0,"William Lloyd Garrison, the Abolitionist (#13)"],[1," from the trial and imprisonment of  the young editor of _The Genius of Universal Emancipation_. \"As the news  of my imprisonment became extensively known,\" he wrote, \"and the merits  of the case understood, not a mail rolled into the city but it brought  me consolatary letters from individuals hitherto unknown to me, and  periodicals of all kinds from every section of the Union (not even  excepting the South), all uniting to give me a triumphant acquittal--all  severely reprehending the conduct of Mr. Todd--and all regarding my  trial as a mockery of justice.\" This unexpected result was one of those  accidents of history, which \"have laws as fixed as planets have.\"    The prosecution and imprisonment of Garrison was without doubt designed  to terrorize him into silence on the subject of slavery. But his  persecutors had reckoned without a knowledge of their victim. Garrison  had the martyr's temperament and invincibility of purpose. His  earnestness burned the more intensely with the growth of opposition and  peril. Within \"gloomy walls close pent,\" he warbled gay as a bird of a  freedom which tyrants could not touch, nor bolts confine:      \"No chains can bind it, and no cell enclose,    Swifter than light, it flies from pole to pole,    And in a flash from earth to heaven it goes!\"      or with deep, stern gladness sang he to \"The Guiltless Prisoner\" how:      \"A martyr's crown is richer than a king's!    Think it an honor with thy Lord to bleed,    And glory 'midst intensest sufferings;    Though beat--imprisoned--put to open shame    Time shall embalm and magnify thy name.\"      \"Is it supposed by Judge Brice,\" the guiltless prisoner wrote from his  cell, \"that his frowns can intimidate me, or his sentence stifle my  voice on the subject of African oppression? He does not know me. So long  as a good Providence gives me strength and intellect, I will not cease  to declare that the existence of slavery in this country is a foul  reproach to the American name; nor will I hesitate to proclaim the guilt  of kidnappers, slave abettors, or slaveowners, wheresoever they may  reside, or however high they may be exalted. I am only in the _alphabet_  of my task; time shall perfect a useful work. It is my shame that I have  done so little for the people of color; yea, before God, I feel humbled  that my feelings are so cold, and my language so weak. A few white  victims must be sacrificed to open the eyes of this nation, and to show  the tyranny of our laws. I expect and am willing to be persecuted,  imprisoned, and bound for advocating African rights; and I should  deserve to be a slave myself if I shrunk from that duty or danger.\" The  story of the trial of William Lloyd Garrison, from which the above brave  words are taken, fell into the hands of that noble man and munificent  merchant, Arthur Tappan, of New York. From the reading of it he rose  \"with that deep feeling of abhorrence of slavery and its abettors which  every one must feel who is capable of appreciating the blessings of  liberty,\" and thereupon notified Lundy to draw upon him for one hundred  dollars if that amount would give the young editor his liberty. The fine  and costs of court were accordingly paid and just forty-nine days after  entering Baltimore jail a prisoner, Garrison recovered his freedom. The  civil action of Todd against him was still pending. Nothing daunted  Garrison went North two days after his discharge to obtain certain  evidence deemed important by his counsel to his defence. He took with  him an open letter from Lundy looking to the renewal of the weekly  _Genius_ under their joint control. Prior to Garrison's trial the paper  had fallen into great stress for want of money. Lundy and he had made a  division of their labors, the latter doing the editorial and office  work, while the former traveled from place to place soliciting  subscriptions and collecting generally the sinews of war. But the  experiment was not successful from a business standpoint. For as  Garrison playfully observed subsequently: \"Where friend Lundy could get  one new subscriber, I could knock a _dozen_ off, and I did so. It was  the old experiment of the frog in the well, that went two feet up and  fell three feet back, at every jump.\" Where the income of the paper did  not exceed fifty dollars in four months and the weekly expenditure  amounted to at least that sum, the financial failure of the enterprise  was inevitable. This unhappy event did actually occur six weeks before  the junior editor went to jail; and the partnership was formally  dissolved in the issue of the _Genius_ of March 5, 1830. But when Arthur  Tappan made his generous offer of a hundred dollars to effect Garrison's  release, he made at the same time an offer of an equal amount to aid the  editors in reestablishing the _Genius_. This proposition led to hopes on  the part of the two friends to a renewal of their partnership in the  cause of emancipation. And so Garrison's visit to the North was taken  advantage of to test the disposition of Northern philanthropy to support  such a paper. But what he found was a sad lack of interest in the slave.  Everywhere he went he encountered what appeared to him to be the most  monstrous indifference and apathy on the subject. The prejudices of the  free States seemed to him stronger than were those of the South. Instead  of receiving aid and encouragement to continue the good work of himself  and coadjutor, and for the doing of which he had served a term of seven  weeks in prison, men, even his best friends sought to influence him to  give it up, and to persuade him to forsake the slave, and to turn his  time and talents to safer and more profitable enterprises nearer home.  He was informed by these worldly wise men and Job's counselors that his  \"scheme was visionary, fanatical, unattainable.\" \"Why should he make  himself,\" they argued, \"an exile from home and all that he held dear on  earth, and sojourn in a strange land, among enemies whose hearts were  dead to every noble sentiment?\" Ah! he himself confessed that all were  against his return to Baltimore. But his love of the slave was stronger  than the strength of the temptation. He put all these selfish objections  behind him. As he has recorded the result of this experience:  \"Opposition served only to increase my ardor, and confirm my purpose.\"  Strange and incomprehensible to his fellows is the man who prefers  \"persecution, reproach, and poverty\" with duty, to worldly ease and  honor and riches without it. When a man appears in society who is not  controlled by motives which usually govern the conduct of other men he  becomes at first an object of pity, then of contempt, and, lastly, of  hate. Garrison we may be sure at the end of this visit had made rapid  transit from the first to the second of these stages in the esteem of  his generation.    His experience was not all of this deplorable kind. He left Baltimore  without the money required to pay his way North, depending literally  upon the good God to provide for him the necessary means to complete his  journey. And such help was more than once providentially afforded the  young apostle of liberty. At New York, when he did not know how he was  to go farther for want of means, he met a Mr. Samuel Leggett who gave  him a pass on the \"splendid steamboat _President_.\" It seems that this  friend in his need had read with indignation the story of his trial. The  bread which he had scattered from his prison on the waters of public  sentiment had thus returned to him after many days in the timely  assistance of a sympathetic soul. And then, again, when he was in Boston  in sore distress for a little money, suddenly, beautifully, the desire  of his heart was satisfied. But let him tell the incident in his own  touching way. His face was turned toward Baltimore: \"But how was I to  return?\" he asks. \"I had not a dollar in my pocket, and my time was  expired. No one understood my circumstances. I was too proud to beg, and  ashamed to borrow. My friends were prodigal of pity, but of nothing  else. In the extremity of my uneasiness, I went to the Boston  post-office, and found a letter from my friend Lundy, inclosing a draft  for $100 from a stranger and as a remuneration for my poor inefficient  services in behalf of the slaves!\" The munificent stranger was Ebenezer  Dole, of Hallowell, Maine. Money thus acquired was a sacred trust to  this child of Providence. \"After deducting the expenses of traveling,\"  he goes on to say, \"the remainder of the above-named sum was applied in  discharging a few of the debts incurred by the unproductiveness of the  _Genius_.\"    Garrison returned to Baltimore, but he did not tarry long in that  slave-ruled city. Todd's suit against him was tried after his departure,  and the jury soothed the Newburyport merchant's wounded pride with a  verdict for a thousand dollars. He never attempted, however, to enforce  the payment of the same being content probably with the \"vindication,\"  which his legal victory gave him.    Before the reformer left Baltimore he had definitely abandoned the plans  looking to a revival of his interest in the _Genius_. He determined  instead to publish a sheet devoted to the abolition of slavery under his  sole management and control. This paper he proposed to call the _Public  Liberator_, and to issue from Washington. The prospectus of this  journalistic project bearing date, August, 1830, declares in its opening  sentence its \"primary object\" to be \"the abolition of slavery, and the  moral and intellectual elevation of our colored population.\" \"I shall  spare no efforts,\" he pledged himself, \"to delineate the withering  influence of slavery upon our national prosperity and happiness, its  awful impiety, its rapid extension, and its inevitable consequences if  it be suffered to exist without hindrance.

Fresh-water shells are  also subject to great variation, so that there is much uncertainty as  to the number of species; and variations are especially frequent in the  Planorbidae, which exhibit many eccentric deviations from the usual form  of the species--deviations which must often affect the form of the  living animal. In Mr. Ingersoll's Report on the Recent Mollusca of  Colorado many of these extraordinary variations are referred to, and it  is stated that a shell (Helisonia trivolvis) abundant in some small  ponds and lakes, had scarcely two specimens alike, and many of them  closely resembled other and altogether distinct species.[17]      _The Variability of Insects_.    Among Insects there is a large amount of variation, though very few  entomologists devote themselves to its investigation. Our first examples  will be taken from the late Mr. T. Vernon Wollaston's book, _On the  Variation of Species_, and they must be considered as indications of  very widespread though little noticed phenomena. He speaks of the  curious little carabideous beetles of the genus Notiophilus as being  \"extremely unstable both in their sculpture and hue;\" of the common  Calathus mollis as having \"the hind wings at one time ample, at another  rudimentary, and at a third nearly obsolete;\" and of the same  irregularity as to the wings being characteristic of many Orthoptera and  of the Homopterous Fulgoridae. Mr. Westwood in his _Modern  Classification of Insects_ states that \"the species of Gerris,  Hydrometra, and Velia are mostly found perfectly apterous, though  occasionally with full-sized wings.\"    It is, however, among the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) that the  most numerous cases of variation have been observed, and every good  collection of these insects affords striking examples. I will first  adduce the testimony of Mr. Bates, who speaks of the butterflies of the  Amazon valley exhibiting innumerable local varieties or races, while  some species showed great individual variability. Of the beautiful  Mechanitis Polymnia he says, that at Ega on the Upper Amazons, \"it  varies not only in general colour and pattern, but also very  considerably in the shape of the wings, especially in the male sex.\"  Again, at St. Paulo, Ithomia Orolina exhibits four distinct varieties,  all occurring together, and these differ not only in colour but in form,  one variety being described as having the fore wings much elongated in  the male, while another is much larger and has \"the hind wings in the  male different in shape.\" Of Heliconius Numata Mr. Bates says: \"This  species is so variable that it is difficult to find two examples exactly  alike,\" while \"it varies in structure as well as in colours. The wings  are sometimes broader, sometimes narrower; and their edges are simple in  some examples and festooned in others.\" Of another species of the same  genus, H. melpomene, ten distinct varieties are described all more or  less connected by intermediate forms, and four of these varieties were  obtained at one locality, Serpa on the north bank of the Amazon.  Ceratina Ninonia is another of these very unstable species exhibiting  many local varieties which are, however, incomplete and connected by  intermediate forms; while the several species of the genus Lycorea all  vary to such an extent as almost to link them together, so that Mr.  Bates thinks they might all fairly be considered as varieties of one  species only.    Turning to the Eastern Hemisphere we have in Papilio Severus a species  which exhibits a large amount of simple variation, in the presence or  absence of a pale patch on the upper wings, in the brown submarginal  marks on the lower wings, in the form and extent of the yellow band, and  in the size of the specimens. The most extreme forms, as well as the  intermediate ones, are often found in one locality and in company with  each other. A small butterfly (Terias hecabe) ranges over the whole of  the Indian and Malayan regions to Australia, and everywhere exhibits  great variations, many of which have been described as distinct species;  but a gentleman in Australia bred two of these distinct forms (T. hecabe  and T. Aesiope), with several intermediates, from one batch of  caterpillars found feeding together on the same plant.[18] It is  therefore very probable that a considerable number of supposed distinct  species are only individual varieties.    Cases of variation similar to those now adduced among butterflies might  be increased indefinitely, but it is as well to note that such important  characters as the neuration of the wings, on which generic and family  distinctions are often established, are also subject to variation. The  Rev. R.P. Murray, in 1872, laid before the Entomological Society  examples of such variation in six species of butterflies, and other  cases have been since described. The larvae of butterflies and moths are  also very variable, and one observer recorded in the _Proceedings of the  Entomological Society for_ 1870 no less than sixteen varieties of the  caterpillar of the bedstraw hawk-moth (Deilephela galii).      _Variation among Lizards_.    Passing on from the lower animals to the vertebrata, we find more  abundant and more definite evidence as to the extent and amount of  individual variation. I will first give a case among the Reptilia from  some of Mr. Darwin's unpublished MSS., which have been kindly lent me by  Mr. Francis Darwin.    \"M. Milne Edwards (_Annales des Sci. Nat._, I ser., tom. xvi. p. 50) has  given a curious table of measurements of fourteen specimens of Lacerta  muralis; and, taking the length of the head as a standard, he finds the  neck, trunk, tail, front and hind legs, colour, and femoral pores, all  varying wonderfully; and so it is more or less with other species. So  apparently trifling a character as the scales on the head affording  almost the only constant characters.\"    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Variations of Lacerta muralis.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Variation of Lizards.]    As the table of measurements above referred to would give no clear  conception of the nature and amount of the variation without a laborious  study and comparison of the figures, I have endeavoured to find a method  of presenting the facts to the eye, so that they may be easily grasped  and appreciated. In the diagram opposite, the comparative variations of  the different organs of this species are given by means of variously  bent lines. The head is represented by a straight line because it  presented (apparently) no variation. The body is next given, the  specimens being arranged in the order of their size from No. 1, the  smallest, to No. 14, the largest, the actual lengths being laid down  from a base line at a suitable distance below, in this case two inches  below the centre, the mean length of the body of the fourteen specimens  being two inches. The respective lengths of the neck, legs, and toe of  each specimen are then laid down in the same manner at convenient  distances apart for comparison; and we see that their variations bear no  definite relation to those of the body, and not much to those of each  other. With the exception of No. 5, in which all the parts agree in  being large, there is a marked independence of each part, shown by the  lines often curving in opposite directions; which proves that in those  specimens one part is large while the other is small. The actual amount  of the variation is very great, ranging from one-sixth of the mean  length in the neck to considerably more than a fourth in the hind leg,  and this among only fourteen examples which happen to be in a particular  museum.    To prove that this is not an isolated case, Professor Milne Edwards also  gives a table showing the amount of variation in the museum specimens of  six common species of lizards, also taking the head as the standard, so  that the comparative variation of each part to the head is given. In the  accompanying diagram (Fig. 2) the variations are exhibited by means of  lines of varying length. It will be understood that, however much the  specimens varied in _size_, if they had kept the same _proportions_, the  variation line would have been in every case reduced to a point, as in  the neck of L. velox which exhibits no variation. The different  proportions of the variation lines for each species may show a distinct  mode of variation, or may be merely due to the small and differing  number of specimens; for it is certain that whatever amount of variation  occurs among a few specimens will be greatly increased when a much  larger number of specimens are examined. That the amount of variation is  large, may be seen by comparing it with the actual length of the head  (given below the diagram) which was used as a standard in determining  the variation, but which itself seems not to have varied.[19]      _Variation among Birds_.    Coming now to the class of Birds, we find much more copious evidence of  variation. This is due partly to the fact that Ornithology has perhaps a  larger body of devotees than any other branch of natural history (except  entomology); to the moderate size of the majority of birds; and to the  circumstance that the form and dimensions of the wings, tail, beak, and  feet offer the best generic and specific characters and can all be  easily measured and compared. The most systematic observations on the  individual variation of birds have been made by Mr. J.A. Allen, in his  remarkable memoir: \"On the Mammals and Winter Birds of East Florida,  with an examination of certain assumed specific characters in Birds, and  a sketch of the Bird Faunae of Eastern North America,\" published in the  _Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology_ at Harvard College, "]]]
