Sceptres of the present  time are splendidly decorated with jewellery. The annexed engraving  represents two sceptres of the kings of England: _the sceptre with  the dove_ is of gold, three feet seven inches long; the circumference  of the handle is three inches, and two inches and a quarter at the end  of the staff; the pomel is decorated with a fillet of table diamonds  and other precious stones; the mound at the top is enriched with a  band of rose diamonds; upon the mound is a small cross of Calvary,  over which is a dove with its wings expanded, as the emblem of mercy.    _The royal Sceptre with the Cross_ is of gold; the handle is plain,  and the upper part wreathed; it is in length two feet nine inches, the  fleur-de-lis of six leaves; the mound, and the cross above it, are  richly embellished with amethysts and diamonds.    SCARPE. A diminutive of the bend sinister.    [Illustration: Scarpe]    Ex. Argent, a scarpe, gules.    SCROLL. The riband below the escutcheon, on which the motto is  inscribed.    SEEDED. When the seed of a rose or any other flower is of a different  tint from the petal, it is called seeded. The heraldic colour of the  seed in the centre of a flower is or, but, as in other proper names,  the colour of the seed is not mentioned unless it is of a different  tincture.    [Illustration: Set foil or Six foil]    SET FOIL OR SIX FOIL. Six leaves conjoined in the centre.    SEGREANT. This term is used to describe a griffin displaying its wings  as if about to fly.    [Illustration: Segreant]    Ex. A griffin rampant, segreant, gules.    SEJANT. French word for sitting. See LION SEJANT.    SEME. A French word for strewed. A field powdered or strewed with any  object is said to be seme: thus a shield may be seme of fleur-de-lis,  seme of hearts, &c.    SINISTER. A term used in Heraldry to signify the left side of any  object. Thus a bend proceeding from the top of the left side of the  shield is called a bend sinister.    SLIPPED. Torn from the stock or branch.    [Illustration: Slipped]    Ex. Azure, three laurel leaves slipped, argent.    SOL. A planet, formerly used to denote or, in emblazoning royal arms.  It is the Latin name for the sun.    SOL, or THE SUN IN ITS SPLENDOUR. The sun is said to be in its  splendour when it is figured (that is, delineated with a human face)  and surrounded with rays. Sometimes this figure is called a sun in its  glory.    [Illustration: Sol, or The Sun in its Splendour]    Ex. Azure, a sun in its splendour.    STANDARD. A large square flag bearing the whole of the achievements of  the monarch or nobleman, as seen in the royal standard of England. The  royal standard, when placed before the pavilion of the monarch either  at a tournay or in an encampment, was eleven yards long and three  yards broad.    The length of the standard when borne in the field denoted the rank  of the leader: that of a duke was seven yards long; a peer of lower  degree raised a standard five yards in length; that of a knight  banneret was only four. In modern times standards of peers or knights  banneret are seldom displayed but in funeral processions. The standard  is then long and narrow, and pointed at the end; that of a duke is  about fifteen feet in length, peers of lower degree about twelve.    The flag borne as the ensign of a regiment of cavalry is called a  standard. The flags of foot soldiers are called colours.    STAR. This celestial figure is always represented as argent, and is  supposed to have six rays or points; if they have more points the  number must be named. See ETOILE.    STATANT. An animal standing still with all its legs on the ground. See  LION STATANT.    SUPPORTERS are figures standing on the scroll, placed on each side of  the shield as if to support it. Supporters in English Heraldry are  granted only to persons included in the rank of nobility or to knights  banneret by favour of the sovereign.    The origin of this addition to the external ornaments of the  escutcheon may be traced to the practice which originally prevailed  in the regulation of tournaments. Some days prior to the tournament  taking place, each knight desirous of entering the lists was required  to hang up his shield, upon which his arms were emblazoned, at  the place appointed by the prince or nobleman that proclaimed the  tournament, that they might be examined by the heralds, to prevent  unqualified persons entering the lists. Each shield thus exhibited  was guarded or supported by the servants of the knight to whom it  belonged, and to disguise their livery these guardians of the shield  assumed the appearance of savages, Moors, lions, griffins, and various  other animals.    In after times, on the creation of a peer, the Heralds selected the  supporters they deemed most appropriate, having some allusion either  to the deeds, name, title, arms, or motto of the newly-created peer.    SURMOUNTED. A figure or bearing having another over it.    [Illustration: Surmounted]    Ex. Gules, a sword erect in pale, argent, surmounted by two keys,  saltier, or.    SURTOUT. The French word for \"over all.\" See ESCUTCHEON OF PRETENCE  and OVER ALL.    TALBOT. A dog formerly used for hunting. It is formed something  between a hound and a beagle, with a large snout, and long, round,  thick ears.    [Illustration: Talbot]    Ex. Argent, a talbot's head erased, seme of billets.    TENNE, or TAWNEY. One of the tinctures used in emblazoning arms. It  signifies orange colour, and is represented in engraving by lines  drawn diagonally from the sinister to the dexter side of the shield,  traversed by perpendicular lines from the base to the chief.    [Illustration: Tiara]    TIARA. The Pope's mitre, with its triple crowns.    TINCTURE. A term used in Heraldry to express colour.    TOPAZ. The name of a precious stone, formerly used instead of or, in  emblazoning the arms of the English nobility.    TORTEAUX. Red roundlets.    [Illustration: Torteaux]    Ex. Argent, three torteaux in bend, sinister.    TOURNAMENTS were combats of honour, in which persons of noble birth  entered the lists to gain reputation in feats of arms. The name is  derived from _tourner_, to turn, from the horsemen turning frequently  as they rode round the enclosure, and during the course of the  engagement. The design of tournaments was to train the nobility to  the use of arms; none, therefore, were admitted to these sports but  persons of noble birth, who could prove their descent, at least, by  three generations. They were also required to be men of unspotted  honour and integrity.    It was customary for princes, on some public festivity or rejoicing,  to appoint a day for these entertainments, and give public notice to  the knights in their own territories, as well as in the neighbouring  states.    The knights generally made their appearance four days before the  combat. They endeavoured to excel each other in the splendour of their  equipage and dress, and in the excellence and beauty of their horses,  which were adorned with the most costly caparisons. Their armorial  ensigns were displayed with great pomp during three days, that all who  viewed them might judge if they were worthy of entering the lists. The  field where the tournament was to be held was railed in with pales.  This place was called the lists. A king was appointed to preside over  the sports, as were also judges to examine the knights' armour and  arms, and to see that no unfair advantage was taken. A number of other  officers were appointed, which our space will not allow us to mention.    A short distance from the lists were the galleries and pavilions for  the spectators; the most splendid was that fitted up for the lady who  presided as queen of the tournament and her attendants, all splendidly  attired. The most noble and most beautiful ladies of the court crowded  to these martial entertainments to inspire the combatants with ardour,  by giving them some token or favour, such as a scarf, veil, or  bracelet, with which the knight adorned his helmet or spear.    Their arms were lances of light wood, without iron at the top; swords  without edge or point; in some instances wooden swords were used.  The knights were formed into two parties, and entered the lists by  different barriers, riding round the lists several times to pay their  respects to their sovereign and the ladies. At length the heralds  sounded to arms; the quadrils, or troop, took their stations; when the  charge was sounded, the knights rushed against each other with the  utmost impetuosity. The clashing of swords, the sounding shields, the  war-cry of the knights, who shouted the name of their ladye-love in  the midst of the mimic strife, greatly excited the spectators, who, in  return, cheered and encouraged the combatants. When the knights were  brave and determined, the contest lasted some hours; the vanquished,  that is, those who were thrown from their horses, withdrew from the  lists as quietly as possible, leaving the field to their successful  opponents. The victory was decided by the number of knights unhorsed.  The prizes to the victors were adjudged and delivered by the queen  and the ladies. This authority of the fair sex contributed greatly to  polish the manners of the nobility and gentry of the middle ages, who  were anxious to court the favour of those who were the distributors of  public honours.    Sometimes this entertainment was followed by jousts. Two cavaliers,  out of gallantry, would break a lance in honour of the ladies. These  were followed by others until the lists were again cleared for the  tournament. The difference between tournaments and jousts was, that  the former were in the nature of battles, the latter of duels.    When the sports were over, the heralds and pursuivants declared the  names and titles of the knights, and proclaimed the heraldic ornaments  which the emperor, king, or prince that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16287"],[0,"Talks To Teachers On Psychology; And To Students On Some Of Life's Ideals (#13)"],[1,"thing. Lend  the child his books, pencils, and other apparatus: then give them to  him, make them his own, and notice the new light with which they  instantly shine in his eyes. He takes a new kind of care of them  altogether. In mature life, all the drudgery of a man's business or  profession, intolerable in itself, is shot through with engrossing  significance because he knows it to be associated with his personal  fortunes. What more deadly uninteresting object can there be than a  railroad time-table? Yet where will you find a more interesting object  if you are going on a journey, and by its means can find your train? At  such times the time-table will absorb a man's entire attention, its  interest being borrowed solely from its relation to his personal life.  _From all these facts there emerges a very simple abstract programme for  the teacher to follow in keeping the attention of the child: Begin with  the line of his native interests, and offer him objects that have some  immediate connection with these_. The kindergarten methods, the  object-teaching routine, the blackboard and manual-training work,--all  recognize this feature. Schools in which these methods preponderate are  schools where discipline is easy, and where the voice of the master  claiming order and attention in threatening tones need never be heard.    _Next, step by step, connect with these first objects and experiences  the later objects and ideas which you wish to instill. Associate the new  with the old in some natural and telling way, so that the interest,  being shed along from point to point, finally suffuses the entire system  of objects of thought._    This is the abstract statement; and, abstractly, nothing can be easier  to understand. It is in the fulfilment of the rule that the difficulty  lies; for the difference between an interesting and a tedious teacher  consists in little more than the inventiveness by which the one is able  to mediate these associations and connections, and in the dulness in  discovering such transitions which the other shows. One teacher's mind  will fairly coruscate with points of connection between the new lesson  and the circumstances of the children's other experience. Anecdotes and  reminiscences will abound in her talk; and the shuttle of interest will  shoot backward and forward, weaving the new and the old together in a  lively and entertaining way. Another teacher has no such inventive  fertility, and his lesson will always be a dead and heavy thing. This is  the psychological meaning of the Herbartian principle of 'preparation'  for each lesson, and of correlating the new with the old. It is the  psychological meaning of that whole method of concentration in studies  of which you have been recently hearing so much. When the geography and  English and history and arithmetic simultaneously make cross-references  to one another, you get an interesting set of processes all along the  line.           *       *       *       *       *    If, then, you wish to insure the interest of your pupils, there is only  one way to do it; and that is to make certain that they have something  in their minds _to attend with_, when you begin to talk. That something  can consist in nothing but a previous lot of ideas already interesting  in themselves, and of such a nature that the incoming novel objects  which you present can dovetail into them and form with them some kind of  a logically associated or systematic whole. Fortunately, almost any kind  of a connection is sufficient to carry the interest along. What a help  is our Philippine war at present in teaching geography! But before the  war you could ask the children if they ate pepper with their eggs, and  where they supposed the pepper came from. Or ask them if glass is a  stone, and, if not, why not; and then let them know how stones are  formed and glass manufactured. External links will serve as well as  those that are deeper and more logical. But interest, once shed upon a  subject, is liable to remain always with that subject. Our acquisitions  become in a measure portions of our personal self; and little by little,  as cross-associations multiply and habits of familiarity and practice  grow, the entire system of our objects of thought consolidates, most of  it becoming interesting for some purposes and in some degree.    An adult man's interests are almost every one of them intensely  artificial: they have slowly been built up. The objects of professional  interest are most of them, in their original nature, repulsive; but by  their connection with such natively exciting objects as one's personal  fortune, one's social responsibilities, and especially by the force of  inveterate habit, they grow to be the only things for which in middle  life a man profoundly cares.    But in all these the spread and consolidation have followed nothing but  the principles first laid down. If we could recall for a moment our  whole individual history, we should see that our professional ideals and  the zeal they inspire are due to nothing but the slow accretion of one  mental object to another, traceable backward from point to point till we  reach the moment when, in the nursery or in the schoolroom, some little  story told, some little object shown, some little operation witnessed,  brought the first new object and new interest within our ken by  associating it with some one of those primitively there. The interest  now suffusing the whole system took its rise in that little event, so  insignificant to us now as to be entirely forgotten. As the bees in  swarming cling to one another in layers till the few are reached whose  feet grapple the bough from which the swarm depends; so with the objects  of our thinking,--they hang to each other by associated links, but the  _original_ source of interest in all of them is the native interest  which the earliest one once possessed.          XI. ATTENTION      Whoever treats of interest inevitably treats of attention, for to say  that an object is interesting is only another way of saying that it  excites attention. But in addition to the attention which any object  already interesting or just becoming interesting claims--passive  attention or spontaneous attention, we may call it--there is a more  deliberate attention,--voluntary attention or attention with effort, as  it is called,--which we can give to objects less interesting or  uninteresting in themselves. The distinction between active and passive  attention is made in all books on psychology, and connects itself with  the deeper aspects of the topic. From our present purely practical point  of view, however, it is not necessary to be intricate; and passive  attention to natively interesting material requires no further  elucidation on this occasion. All that we need explicitly to note is  that, the more the passive attention is relied on, by keeping the  material interesting; and the less the kind of attention requiring  effort is appealed to; the more smoothly and pleasantly the classroom  work goes on. I must say a few more words, however, about this latter  process of voluntary and deliberate attention.    One often hears it said that genius is nothing but a power of sustained  attention, and the popular impression probably prevails that men of  genius are remarkable for their voluntary powers in this direction. _But  a little introspective observation will show any one that voluntary  attention cannot be continuously sustained,--that it comes in beats._  When we are studying an uninteresting subject, if our mind tends to  wander, we have to bring back our attention every now and then by using  distinct pulses of effort, which revivify the topic for a moment, the  mind then running on for a certain number of seconds or minutes with  spontaneous interest, until again some intercurrent idea captures it and  takes it off. Then the processes of volitional recall must be repeated  once more. Voluntary attention, in short, is only a momentary affair.  The process, whatever it is, exhausts itself in the single act; and,  unless the matter is then taken in hand by some trace of interest  inherent in the subject, the mind fails to follow it at all. The  sustained attention of the genius, sticking to his subject for hours  together, is for the most part of the passive sort. The minds of  geniuses are full of copious and original associations. The subject of  thought, once started, develops all sorts of fascinating consequences.  The attention is led along one of these to another in the most  interesting manner, and the attention never once tends to stray away.    In a commonplace mind, on the other hand, a subject develops much less  numerous associates: it dies out then quickly; and, if the man is to  keep up thinking of it at all, he must bring his attention back to it by  a violent wrench. In him, therefore, the faculty of voluntary attention  receives abundant opportunity for cultivation in daily life. It is your  despised business man, your common man of affairs, (so looked down on by  the literary awarders of fame) whose virtue in this regard is likely to  be most developed; for he has to listen to the concerns of so many  uninteresting people, and to transact so much drudging detail, that the  faculty in question is always kept in training. A genius, on the  contrary, is the man in whom you are least likely to find the power of  attending to anything insipid or distasteful in itself. He breaks his  engagements, leaves his letters unanswered, neglects his family duties  incorrigibly, because he is powerless to turn his attention down and  back from those more interesting trains of imagery with which his genius  constantly occupies his mind.    Voluntary attention is thus an essentially instantaneous affair. You can  claim it, for your purposes in the schoolroom, by commanding it in loud,  imperious tones; and you can easily get it in this way. But, unless the"]]]
