Our specimen had a few yellowish spots on  the cap, and is called Var. maculosus. (Edible.)      +PAXILLUS LEPTOPUS = thin and a foot.+    +The Thin-stemmed Paxillus.+    This is the only specimen of the genus Paxillus that we have found.  There is another species, P. involutus, which Professor Peck says is  edible. Stevenson says that P. leptopus is a remarkable species, that it  is distinguished from P. involutus by having the gills simple at the  base, not united by interlacing or transverse veins (anastomosing).  +Cap+ was a light brownish-yellow; it varies from 1 1/2 to 3 inches in  breadth, eccentric or lateral, depressed in the middle, dry, covered  with dense down, soon torn into scales, which are a dingy yellow. Flesh  yellow. +Stem+ short, scarcely 1 inch, tapering downward, yellow inside.  +Gills+ decurrent, tense and straight, crowded, narrow, yellowish, then  darker in color. It was growing on the ground in September.      [Illustration:      1. Boletus edulis.    2. Hypholoma perplexum.    3. Marasmius rotula.    4. Calostoma cinnebarinus.]      MUSHROOMS WITH PURPLE OR VIOLET-COLORED CAP.      +CORTINARIUS ALBO-VIOLACEOUS = white and violet.+    +The Violet-colored Cortinarius.+    +Cap+ whitish-violet, 2 to 3 inches broad, fleshy, convex, broadly  umbonate or gibbous, dry, beautifully silky and becoming even; flesh  juicy, a bluish-white color. +Stem+ 2 to 4 inches long, solid, firm,  bulbous, club-shaped, 1/2 to 1 inch thick. It is, both outside and inside,  of a whitish violet color, often fibrillose above, with the cortina, and  sometimes with the white veil, in the form of a zone at the middle.  +Gills+ adnate, 2 to 3 lines broad, somewhat distant, slightly  serrulated, of a peculiar ashy violaceous color, at length slightly  cinnamon from the spores. It has no odor and the taste is insipid. We  found this in the woods in the month of October, growing on dead leaves;  a pretty fungus from the violet tints.          DESCRIPTIONS OF SOME FAMILIAR MUSHROOMS WITHOUT REGARD TO COLOR.      Here follows a list of fungi that we constantly see, but which cannot be  classified by the color of the cap.      POLYPOREI, PORE-BEARING FUNGI.      +FISTULINA HEPATICA = liver.+    +The Beefsteak Fungus.+    This species grows on trees, oaks or chestnuts, in hot weather. +Cap+ is  of a dark-red color, which probably suggested the name. It is generally  2 to 6 inches broad, but often grows to an immense size. The surface is  rough, the flesh thick, viscid above, soft when young, when old tough,  covered with tenacious fibres. +Stem+ short and thick. +Pores+ at first  pallid or yellowish-pink when young; they become brownish ochraceous  when old. It is changeable in form, is sometimes sessile (without a  stem), or it has a short lateral stem.    The genus Fistulina, to which this mushroom belongs, has the under  surface of the cap covered with minute hollow pores, which are separate  from one another and stand side by side. The shape varies. It is  sometimes long, shaped like a tongue, or roundish. It is  peculiar-looking. It is considered good for food and nourishing, but the  taste is said to be rather acid. The specimens we found varied from 2 to  5 inches in diameter. They were of a dark-red color, and were tough and  old. They grew upon a tree in a large forest, and were not found  anywhere else.      +POLYPORUS BETULINUS = birch.+    +The Birch Polyporus.+    We shall meet a great many fungi on our walks that belong to the genus  Polyporus. They are generally leathery (coriaceous) fungi, and many grow  on wood. A few are edible, but are not recommended as food. The species  P. betulinus is found on living and dead birch trees. The specimens we  found grew in great quantities, of all sizes, from 1 1/2 to 6 inches  broad. They were at first pure white, and then assumed a brownish tinge.  The edges were obtuse, the caps fleshy, then corky, smooth, the upper  ends not regular, oblique in the form of an umbo or little knob, the  pellicles or outside layers thin and easily separated. Pores short,  small, unequal, at length separating. The shape of the fungus is  peculiar, a sort of semi-circular outline that may be called dimidiate.  The margins were involute. They protruded from a split in the bark of  a dead birch tree which lay prostrate on the ground, several feet in  length, and it was literally covered with the fungi, some an inch  wide and snow white, and the largest 5 or 6 inches in width, and of a  brownish-gray tinge. These specimens became as hard as wood after they  had been kept for some time. The thin skin peeled off easily and  disclosed the snowy flesh beneath.      +POLYPORUS PERENNIS = perennial.+    +The Perennial Polyporus.+    +Cap+ is cinnamon-colored, then of a date brown, leathery, tough,  funnel-shaped, becoming smooth, zoned. +Pores+ minute, angular, acute,  at first sprinkled with a white bloom, then naked and torn. +Stem+  slightly firm, thickened downward, velvety. This is a common species,  and one meets with it everywhere on the ground, and on stumps, from July  to January. The cap is 1 1/2 to 2 inches broad, and the stem 1 inch long.      +POLYPORUS PICIPES = pitch and foot.+    +The Black-stemmed Polyporus.+    +Cap+ pallid color, then turning chestnut, often a pale yellowish livid  color, with the disc chestnut, fleshy, leathery, rigid, tough, even,  smooth, depressed at disc or behind. Flesh white. +Stem+ eccentric and  lateral, equal, firm, at first velvety, then naked, and dotted black up  to the pores. +Pores+ decurrent, round, very small, rather slender,  white, then slightly pale and yellowish. This fungus grows on the trunks  of trees, and is found as late as the middle of winter.      +POLYPORUS SULPHUREUS = brimstone.+    +The Sulphury Polyporus.+    This mushroom gains its name from the color of its pores, which are of a  bright sulphur color. It grows in tufted layers (caespitose), sometimes 1  to 2 feet long, and it cannot be mistaken. +Cap+ may measure 8 inches in  breadth, and is of a reddish-yellow color, overlapping like the shingles  of a roof (imbricated). It is wavy and rather smooth. Flesh light  yellowish, then white, splitting open. +Pores+ are minute, even, sulphur  yellow. They retain their color much better than the pileus. The plants  are generally without a stem, but there may be a short stem, which is  lateral. They grow in clusters, all fastened together and one above the  other, and of all sizes. We saw this fungus first in a dense woods,  where its bright color at once attracted our notice. It was growing in a  large cluster, closely packed one over the other. It is said to be good  for food when young and tender.      +POLYPORUS LUCIDUS = bright.+    +The Shining Polyporus.+    One can never mistake this fungus. Its surface looks as if covered with  varnish, rather wrinkled, a bright dark-red color, and its shape is  varied and singular. We have seen it sometimes shaped like a fan, and  like a lady's high comb, or in some fantastic form. Stevenson says it is  a light yellow color and then becomes blood red chestnut. It is first  corky, then woody. +Stem+ lateral, equal, varnished, shining, of the  same color as cap. +Pores+ are long, very small, white and then cinnamon  color. It grows on and about stumps during the summer. +Cap+ is from 2  to 6 inches broad, and the stem 6 to 10 inches long, and 1 or more  thick.      +POLYPORUS VERSICOLOR = changeable.+    +The Changeable Polyporus.+    This species is also common. It is found on dead wood, in all forms and  colors. +Cap+ variegated with different-colored zones; leathery, thin,  rigid, depressed behind, becoming velvety. +Pores+ minute, round, acute  and torn, white, turning pale or yellow.      +POLYPORUS ELEGANS = elegant.+    +The Elegant Polyporus.+    +Cap+ 2 to 4 inches broad, of one color, pallid, ochraceous or orange,  shining, equally fleshy, and then hardened, becoming woody, flattened,  even, smooth. Flesh white. +Stem+ eccentric or lateral, even, smooth,  pallid at first, abruptly black and rooting at the base. +Pores+ plane,  minute, somewhat round, yellowish-white, pallid. The cap differs in  shape from others that have been described; it is not funnel-shaped nor  streaked, and is scarcely depressed, and the flesh is thick to the  margin. It grows on trunks of trees from July to November.      CLAVARIEI, OR CLUB-SHAPED FUNGI.    We now come to another order, Clavariei, of which the first genus is  Clavaria, from a word meaning a club. They are fleshy fungi, not  coriaceous. They have no distinct stem and generally grow on the ground.  We will mention a few of those we often see. They somewhat resemble  coral in growth but not in color.      +CLAVARIA STRICTA = to draw tight.+    +The Constricted Clavaria.+    This Clavaria grows on trunks of trees. It is of a pale yellowish color,  becoming a dusky brown (fuscous) when bruised. The base is about 3 lines  long, thick and much branched. The branches and branchlets are tense and  straight, crowded, adpressed and acute. Stevenson says that this species  is uncommon in Great Britain.      +CLAVARIA FLAVA = yellow.+    +The Pale Yellow Clavaria.+    Stevenson does not mention this species, so it may be peculiar to this  country. +Stem+ is short and stout, thick, and abruptly dissolves into a  dense mass of erect branches nearly parallel. The tips are yellow but  fade when old. It branches below and the stems are whitish. Flesh white.  It is recommended as well flavored and edible.      +CLAVARIA PISTILLARIS = a pestle.+    +The Large Club Clavaria.+    This species belongs to the largest of the unbranched kind. It is  generally 3 to 5 inches high, and 1/2 to 2/3 of an inch thick at top.  Light yellow color, then reddish, and dingy brown in decay. It is smooth  and the flesh soft and white. It is rounded at the top and club-shaped.  It tapers downward toward the base. Stevenson gives the height from 6 "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18458"],[0,"Star Born (#13)"],[1,"snake-devil during its last seconds of life--\"that must not be so!\"    \"If they take the land, you have the sea,\" Dalgard pointed out. The  mermen had a means of escape. But what of his own clansmen? Large  families were unknown among the Terran colonists. In the little more  than a century they had been on this planet their numbers, from the  forty-five survivors of the voyage, had grown to only some two hundred  and fifty, of which only a hundred and twenty were old enough or young  enough to fight. And for them there was no retreat or hiding place.    \"We do not go back to the depths!\" There was stern determination in  that declaration from Sssuri. His tribe had been long hunted, and it  wasn't until they had made a loose alliance with the Terran colonists  that they had dared to leave the dangerous ocean depths, where they  were the prey of monsters more ferocious and cunning than any  snake-devil, to house their families in the coast caves and on the  small islands off-shore, to increase in numbers and develop new skills  of civilization. No, knowing the stubbornness which was bred into  their small, furry bodies, Dalgard did not believe that many of the  sea people would willingly go back into the sunless depths. They would  not surrender tamely to the rulership of the loathed race.    \"I don't see,\" Dalgard spoke aloud, half to himself, as he studied the  tables closely packed, the machines standing on bases about the walls,  the wealth of alien technology, \"what we can do to stop them.\"    The restriction drilled into him from early childhood, that the  knowledge of Those Others was not for his race and in some way  dangerous, gave him an uneasy feeling of guilt just to be standing  there. Danger, danger which was far worse than physical, lurked  there. And he could bring it to life by merely putting out his hand  and picking up any one of those fascinating objects which lay only  inches away. For the pull of curiosity was warring inside him against  the stern warnings of his Elders.    Once when Dalgard had been very small he had raided his father's trip  bag after the next to the last exploring journey the elder Nordis had  made. And he had found a clear block of some kind of greenish crystal,  in the heart of which threadlike lines of color wove patterns which  were utterly strange. When he had turned the block in his hand, those  lines had whirled and changed to form new and intricate designs. And  when he had watched them intently it had seemed that something  happened inside his mind and he knew, here and there, a word, a  fragment of alien thought--just as he normally communicated with the  cub who was Sssuri or the hoppers of the field. And his surprise had  been so great that he had gone running to his father with the cube and  the story of what happened when one watched it.    But there had been no praise for his discovery. Instead he had been  hurried off to the chamber where an old, old man, the son of the Great  Man who had planned to bring them across space, lay in his bed. And  Forken Kordov himself had talked to Dalgard in his old voice, a voice  as withered and thin as the hands crossed helplessly on his shrunken  body, explaining in simple, kindly words that the knowledge which lay  in the cubes, in the oddly shaped books which the Terrans sometimes  came across in the ruins, was not for them. That his own  great-grandfather Dard Nordis, who had been one of the first of the  mutant line of sensitives, had discovered that. And Dalgard, impressed  by Forken, by his father's concern, and by all the circumstances of  that day, had never forgotten nor lost that warning.    \"_We_ cannot hope to stop them,\" Sssuri pointed out. \"But we must  learn when they will come again and be waiting for them--with your  people and mine. For I tell you now, brother of the knife, they must  not be allowed to rise once more!\"    \"And how can we foretell their coming?\" Dalgard wanted to know.    \"Perhaps that alone we cannot do. But when they come they will not  leave speedily. They have stayed here before without harm, and their  distrust has been lulled. When next they come, it will be only  according to their natures that they will wish to stay longer. Not  snatching up the closest to hand of these treasures of theirs, but  choosing out with care those things which will give them the best  results. Therefore they may make a camp, and we can summon others to  aid us.\"    \"To return to Homeport will take several days even if we push,\"  pointed out the scout.    \"Word can pass swifter than man,\" the merman returned, with confidence  in his own plan of action. \"We shall put other eyes, other ears, many  eyes, many ears, to service for us. Be assured we are not the only  ones to fear the return of Those Others from overseas.\"    Dalgard caught his meaning. Yes, it would not be the first time the  hoppers and other small animals living in the grasslands, the runners  and even the moth birds that only the mermen could mind touch, would  relay a message across the land. It might not be an accurate  message--to transmit that by small animal brains was impossible--but  the meaning would reach both merman and colony Elders: trouble in the  north, help needed there. And since Dalgard was the only explorer at  present who had chosen the northern trails, his people would know that  he had sent that warning and would act upon it, as Sssuri's message  would in turn be heeded by the warriors of his tribe.    Yes, it could be done. But what of the traces they had left here--the  slaughtered snake-devils--?    Sssuri had an answer for that also. \"Let them believe that one of my  race came here, or that a party of us ventured to explore inland. We  can make it appear that way. But they must not know of you. I do not  believe that they ever learned of you or how your fathers came from  the sky. And so that may swing the battle in our favor if it comes to  open warfare.\"    What the merman said was sensible enough, and Dalgard was willing to  obey orders. As he left the storehouse, Sssuri trailed him, scuffing  each dusty print the scout left. Perhaps a master of trailcraft could  unravel that spoor, but the colonist was ready to believe that no such  master existed in the ranks of Those Others.    In the outer hall the merman approached the now dead snake-devil and  jerked from its loose skin the arrow which had killed it. Loosing the  head of his ruined spear from his belt, he dug and gouged at the small  wound, tearing it so that its original nature was concealed forever.  Then they retraced their way through the underground passages until  they reached the sanded arena. Already insects buzzed hungrily about  the hulks of the dead monsters.    There was a shrill squeal as the remaining infant reptile fled from  the pouch where it had hidden. Sssuri hurled his knife, and the blade  caught the small devil above the shoulder line, half cutting, half  snapping its tender neck, so that it bounded aimlessly on to crash  against the wall and fall back squirming feebly.    They collected the darts which had killed the others. Dalgard took the  opportunity to study those bands on the forearms of the adults. To his  touch they had the slick smoothness of metal, yet he was unfamiliar  with the material. It possessed the ruddy fire of copper, but through  it ran small black veins. He would have liked to have taken one with  him for investigation, but it was out of the question to pry it off  that scaled limb.    Sssuri straightened up from his last gruesome bit of stage-setting  with a sigh of relief. \"Go ahead.\" He pointed to one of the other  archways. \"I will confuse the trail.\"    Dalgard obeyed, treading as lightly as he could, avoiding all  stretches in which he could leave a clear print. Sssuri ran lightly  back and forth mixing the few impressions to the best of his ability.    They backtracked to the river, retrieved the boat and recrossed, to  leave the city behind and strike into the open country beyond its  sinister walls. Night was falling, and Dalgard was very glad that he  was not to spend the time of darkness within those haunted buildings.  But he knew that it was more than a dislike for being shut up in the  alien dwellings which had brought Sssuri out into the fields. The  second part of their plan must be put into operation.    While Dalgard willed his body motionless, the merman lay relaxed upon  the ground before him as he might have floated upon his beloved waves  in some secluded cove. His brilliant eyes were closed. Yet Dalgard  knew that Sssuri was far from asleep, and with all his own power he  tried to join in the broadcast: that urgency which should send some  hopper, some night runner, on to spread the rumor that there was  trouble in the north, that danger existed and must be investigated.  They had already met one colony of runners ranging southward to  escape. But if they could send another such tribe traveling, arouse  and aim south a hopper exodus, the story would spread until the fringe  would reach the animals who lived in peace within touch of Homeport.    The sun was gone, the dark gathered fast. Dalgard could not even see  the clustered buildings of the city now. And since he lacked Sssuri's  range and staying power, he had no idea whether their efforts had met  with even a shadow of success. He shivered in the bite of the wind and  dared to lay his hand on Sssuri's shoulder, feeling anew the electric  shock of warmth and bursting life which was always there.    Having so broken the other's absorption he asked a question: \"Would it  not be well, brother of the knife, if with the rising sun you returned  to the sea and struck out to join your tribesmen, leaving me here to  watch until you return?\"    Sssuri's answer came with a speed which suggested that he, too, had  been considering that problem. \"We shall see what happens with the  sun's rising. It is true that in the sea I can travel"]]]
