White Humans did it that time.\"    \"Tell me all about it,\" said Dot, \"how did you escape?\"    [Illustration: THE BITTERN HELPS DOT]    \"I escaped then,\" said the Kangaroo, settling herself on her haunches to  tell the tale, \"in a way I could have done last night. But I will die  sooner than do it again.\"    \"Tell me,\" repeated Dot.    \"There is not much to tell,\" said the Kangaroo. \"My little Joey was  getting quite big, and we were very happy. It was a lovely Joey. It was  so strong, and could jump so well for its size. It had the blackest of  little noses and hands and tail you ever saw, and big soft ears which  heard more quickly than mine. All day long I taught it jumping, and we  played and were merry from sunrise to sunset. Until that day I had never  been sad, and I thought all the creatures must be wrong to say that in  this beautiful world there could be such cruel beings as they said White  Humans were. That day taught me I was wrong, and I know now that the  world is a sad place because Humans make it so; although it was made to  be a happy place. We were playing on the side of a plain that day, and  our game was hide-and-seek in the long grass. We were having great fun,  when suddenly little Joey said, 'Strange creatures are coming, big  ones.'    \"I hopped up the stony rise that fringed the plain, and thought as I did  so I could hear a new sound on the breeze. Joey hid in the grass, but  I went boldly into the open on the hillside to see where the danger was.  I saw, far off, Humans on their big animals that go so quickly, and  directly I hopped into the open, they raised a great noise like the  Blacks did last night, and I could see by the movement in the grass that  they had those dreadful dogs they teach to kill us: they are far worse  than dingoes. Joey heard the shouting and bounded into my pouch, and I  went off as fast as I could. It was a worse hunt than last night, for it  was longer, and there was no darkness to help me. I gradually got ahead  in the chase, and I knew if I were alone I could distance them all; for  we had seen them a long way off. But little Joey was heavy, though not  so heavy as you are, and in the long distance I began to feel weak, as  I did last night.    \"I knew if I tried to go on as we were, that those cruel Humans, sitting  quietly on those big beasts (which have four legs and never get tired)  would overtake us, and their dogs (which carry no weight and go so fast)  would tear me down before their masters even arrived, for I was going  gradually slower. So I asked Joey if I dropped him into a soft bush  whether he would hide until I came back for him. It was our only chance.  I had an idea that if I did that he would be safe--even if I got killed;  as they would be more likely to follow me, and never think I had parted  from my little Joey. So we did this, and I crossed a creek, which put  the hounds off the scent, and I got away. In the dusk I came back again  to find Joey, but he had gone, and I could not find a trace of him. All  night and all day I searched, but I've never seen my Joey since,\" said  the Kangaroo sadly, and Dot saw the tears dim her eyes.    Dot could not speak all she felt. She was so sorry for the Kangaroo, and  so ashamed of being a Human. She realized too, how good and forgiving  this dear animal was; how she had cared for her, and nearly died to save  her life, in spite of the wrongs done to her by human beings.    \"When I grow up,\" she said, \"I will never let anyone hurt a bush  creature. They shall all be happy where I am.\"    \"But there are so many Humans. They're getting to be as many as  Kangaroos,\" said the animal reflectively, and shook her head.          CHAPTER X      The fourth day of Dot's wanderings in the Bush dawned brightly. The sun  arose in a sky all gorgeous in gold and crimson, and flashed upon a  world glittering with dewy freshness. Sweet odours from the aromatic  bush filled the air, and every living creature made what noise it could,  to show its joy in being happy and free in the beautiful Bush. Rich and  gurgling came the note of the magpies, the jovial Kookooburras saluted  the sun with rollicking laughter, the crickets chirruped, frogs croaked  in chorus, or solemnly \"popped\" in deep vibrating tones, like the ring  of a woodman's axe. Every now and then came the shriek of the plover, or  the shrill cry of the peeweet; and gayer and more lively than all the  others was the merry clattering of the big bush wagtail in the distance.    As soon as the Kangaroo heard the Bush Wagtail, she and Dot hurried away  to find him. No Christy Minstrel rattling his bones ever made a merrier  sound. \"Click-i-ti-clack, click-i-ti-clack, clack, clack, clack, clack,  click-i-ti-clack,\" he rattled away as fast as he could, just as if he  hadn't a moment to waste for taking breath, and as if the whole lovely  world was made for the enjoyment of Bush Wagtails.    When Dot and the Kangaroo found him, he was swaying about on a branch,  spreading his big tail like a fan, and clattering gaily; but he stopped  in surprise as soon as he saw his visitors.    After greetings, he opened the conversation by talking of the weather,  so as to conceal his astonishment at seeing Dot and the Kangaroo  together.    \"Lovely weather after the rain,\" he said; \"the showers were needed very  much, for insects were getting scarce, and I believe grass was getting  rank, and not very plentiful. There will be a green shoot in a few days,  which will be very welcome to Kangaroos. I heard about you losing your  Joey--my cousin told me. I was very sorry; so sad. Ah! well, such things  will happen in the Bush to anyone. We were most fortunate in our brood;  none of the chicks fell out of the nest, every one of them escaped the  Butcher Birds and were strong of wing. They are all doing well in the  world.\"    Then the vivacious bird came a little nearer to the Kangaroo, and,  dropping his voice, said:    \"But, friend Kangaroo, I'm sorry to see you've taken up with Humans.  You know I have quite set my face against them, although my cousin  is intimate with the whole race. Take my word for it, they're most  uncertain friends. Two Kookooburras were shot last week, in spite of  Government protection. Fact!\" And as the bird spoke he nodded his head  warningly towards the place where Dot was standing.    \"This little Human has been lost in our Bush,\" said the Kangaroo; \"one  had to take care of her, you know.\"    \"Of course, of course; there are exceptions to all rules,\" chattered the  Wagtail. \"And so this is really the lost little Human there has been  such a fuss about!\" added he, eyeing Dot, and making a long whistle of  surprise. \"My cousin told me all about it.\"    \"Then your cousin, Willy Wagtail, knows her lost way,\" said the Kangaroo  joyfully, and Dot came a little nearer in her eagerness to hear the good  news.    \"Of course he does,\" answered the bird; \"there's nothing happens that he  doesn't know. You should have hunted him up.\"    \"I didn't know where to find him,\" said the Kangaroo, \"and I got into  this country, which is new to me.\"    \"Why he is in the same part that he nested in last season. It's no  distance off,\" exclaimed the Wagtail. \"If you could fly, you'd be there  almost directly!\" Then the bird gave a long description of the way they  were to follow to find his cousin Willy, and with many warm thanks the  Kangaroo and Dot bade him adieu.    As they left the Bush Wagtail they could hear him singing this song,  which shows what a merry, happy fellow he is:        \"Click-i-ti, click-i-ti-clack!        Clack! clack! clack! clack!     Who could cry in such weather, 'alack!'     With a sky so blue, and a sun so bright,        Sing 'winter, winter, winter is back!'     Sportive in flight, chatter delight,        Click-i-ti, click-i-ti-clack!      \"I'm so glad that I have the knack        Of singing clack! clack! clack!     If you wish to be happy, just follow my track,     Take this for a motto, this for a code,        Sing 'winter, winter, winter is back!'     Leave care to a toad, and live _a la mode_!        Click-i-ti, click-i-ti-clack!\"      They had no difficulty in following the Wagtail's directions. They soon  struck a creek they had been told to pursue to its end, and about noon  they found themselves in very pretty country. It reminded Dot of the  journey they had made to find the Platypus, for there were the same  beautiful growths of fern and shrubs. There were also great trailing  creepers which hung down like ropes from the tops of the tall trees they  had climbed. These rope-like coils of the creepers made capital swings,  and often Dot clambered into one of the big loops and sat swinging  herself to and fro, laughing and singing, much to the delight and  amusement of the Kangaroo.        \"Swing! swing! a bird on the wing       Is not more happy than I!     Stooping to earth, and seeking the sky.       Swing! swing! swing!     See how high upward I fly!       Here, midst the leaves I swing;     Then, as fast to my swing I cling,       Down I come from the sky!     Swing! swing! a bird on the wing       Is not more happy than I!\"      Thus sang little Dot, tossing herself backwards and forwards, and the  Kangaroo came to the conclusion that there was something very sweet  about little Humans, and that Dot was certainly quite as nice as a Joey  Kangaroo.    In the middle of one of these little swinging diversions, a bird about  the size of a pigeon, with the most wonderfully shiny plumage, flew to  the tree on which Dot was swinging. Dot was so struck by the bird's  beautiful blue-black glossy appearance, and its brightly contrasting  yellow beak and legs, that she stopped swinging at once. \"You _are_ a  pretty bird!\" she said.

Even his subjects, types,  and treatment were, at times, more Umbrian than Bolognese. He was not  so profound in feeling as Perugino, but at times he appeared loftier  in conception. His color was usually rich, his drawing a little sharp  at first, as showing the goldsmith's hand, the surfaces smooth, the  detail elaborate. Later on, his work had a Raphaelesque tinge,  showing perhaps the influence of that rising master. It is probable  that Francia at first was influenced by Costa's methods, and it is  quite certain that he in turn influenced Costa in the matter of  refined drawing and sentiment, though Costa always adhered to a  certain detail and ornament coming from the north, and a landscape  background that is peculiar to himself, and yet reminds one of  Pinturricchio's landscapes. These two men, Francia and Costa, were the  Perugino and Pinturricchio of the Ferrara-Bolognese school, and the  most important painters in that school.    [Illustration: FIG. 32.--SCHOOL OF FRANCIA. MADONNA AND CHILD.  LOUVRE.]    THE LOMBARD SCHOOL: The designation of the Lombard school is rather a  vague one in the history of painting, and is used by historians to  cover a number of isolated schools or men in the Lombardy region. In  the fifteenth century these schools counted for little either in men  or in works. The principal activity was about Milan, which drew  painters from Brescia, Vincenza, and elsewhere to form what is known  as the Milanese school. Vincenzo Foppa (fl. 1455-1492), of Brescia,  and afterward at Milan, was probably the founder of this Milanese  school. His painting is of rather a harsh, exacting nature, and points  to the influence of Padua, at which place he perhaps got his early art  training. Borgognone (1450-1523) is set down as his pupil, a painter  of much sentiment and spiritual feeling. The school was afterward  greatly influenced by the example of Leonardo da Vinci, as will be  shown further on.

BOOKS RECOMMENDED: Those on Italian art before mentioned;       also consult the General Bibliography (page xv.)      PADUAN SCHOOL: It was at Padua in the north that the influence of the  classic marbles made itself strongly apparent. Umbria remained true to  the religious sentiment, Florence engaged itself largely with nature  study and technical problems, introducing here and there draperies and  poses that showed knowledge of ancient sculpture, but at Padua much of  the classic in drapery, figures, and architecture seems to have been  taken directly from the rediscovered antique or the modern bronze.    The early men of the school were hardly great enough to call for  mention. During the fourteenth century there was some Giotto influence  felt--that painter having been at Padua working in the Arena Chapel.  Later on there was a slight influence from Gentile da Fabriano and his  fellow-worker Vittore Pisano, of Verona. But these influences seem to  have died out and the real direction of the school in the early  fifteenth century was given by Francesco Squarcione (1394-1474). He  was an enlightened man, a student, a collector and an admirer of  ancient sculpture, and though no great painter himself he taught an  anatomical statuesque art, based on ancient marbles and nature, to  many pupils.    Squarcione's work has perished, but his teaching was reflected in the  work of his great pupil Andrea Mantegna (1431-1506). Yet Mantegna  never received the full complement of his knowledge from Squarcione.  He was of an observing nature and probably studied Paolo Uccello and  Fra Filippo, some of whose works were then in Paduan edifices. He  gained color knowledge from the Venetian Bellinis, who lived at Padua  at one time and who were connected with Mantegna by marriage. But the  sculpturesque side of his art came from Squarcione, from a study of  the antique, and from a deeper study of Donatello, whose bronzes to  this day are to be seen within and without the Paduan Duomo of S.  Antonio.    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--MANTEGNA. GONZAGA FAMILY GROUP (DETAIL).  MANTUA.]    The sculpturesque is characteristic of Mantegna's work. His people are  hard, rigid at times, immovable human beings, not so much turned to  stone as turned to bronze--the bronze of Donatello. There is little  sense of motion about them. The figure is sharp and harsh, the  drapery, evidently studied from sculpture, is \"liney,\" and the  archaeology is often more scientific than artistic. Mantegna was not,  however, entirely devoted to the sculpturesque. He was one of the  severest nature students of the Early Renaissance, knew about nature,  and carried it out in more exacting detail than was perhaps well for  his art. In addition he was a master of light-and-shade, understood  composition, space, color, atmosphere, and was as scientific in  perspective as Piero della Francesca. There is stiffness in his  figures but nevertheless great truth and character. The forms are  noble, even grand, and for invention and imagination they were never,  in his time, carried further or higher. He was little of a  sentimentalist or an emotionalist, not much of a brush man or a  colorist, but as a draughtsman, a creator of noble forms, a man of  power, he stood second to none in the century.    Of Squarcione's other pupils Pizzolo (fl. 1470) was the most  promising, but died early. Marco Zoppo (1440-1498) seems to have  followed the Paduan formula of hardness, dryness, and exacting detail.  He was possibly influenced by Cosimo Tura, and in turn influenced  somewhat the Ferrara-Bolognese school. Mantegna, however, was the  greatest of the school, and his influence was far-reaching. It  affected the school of"]]]
