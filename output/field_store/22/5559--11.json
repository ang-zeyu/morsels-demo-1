Part II, deals with the conditions in  the French Army, furnishing a most interesting chapter on this subject  under the title, \"The French Army as it Is.\"_    _The compiler of the report, beginning this part of his review on Feb.  1, says that the condition of the French Army is excellent and  appreciably superior to what it was at the beginning of the war from the  three points of view of numbers, quality, and equipment. Continuing, he  says:_    In the higher command important changes have been made. It has, in fact,  been rejuvenated by the promotion of young commanders of proved quality  to high rank. All the old Generals, who at the beginning of August were  at the head of large commands, have been gradually eliminated, some as  the result of the physical strain of war and others by appointment to  territorial commands. This rejuvenation of the higher ranks of the army  has been carried out in a far-reaching manner, and it may be said that  it has embraced all the grades of the military hierarchy from commanders  of brigades to commanders of armies. The result has been to lower the  average age of general officers by ten years. Today more than  three-fourths of the officers commanding armies and army corps are less  than 60 years of age. Some are considerably younger. A number of the  army corps commanders are from 46 to 54 years of age, and the brigade  commanders are usually under 50. There are, in fact, at the front  extremely few general officers over 60, and these are men who are in  full possession of their physical and intellectual powers.      MANY COLONELS PROMOTED.    This rejuvenation of the high command was facilitated by a number of  circumstances, notable among which were the strengthening of the higher  regimental ranks carried out during the three years preceding the war,  as a result of which at the outset of the campaign each infantry  regiment had two Lieutenant Colonels, and each cavalry and artillery  regiment a Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel, and also the system of  promotion for the duration of the war. Many officers who began the war  as Colonels now command brigades. Some are even at the head of divisions  or army corps. Ability proved on the field of battle is now immediately  recognized and utilized, and in this way it has been possible to provide  in the most favorable manner for the vacancies created by the changes in  command which were considered necessary in the first weeks of the war.    The higher grades of the French Army are inspired by a remarkable unity  in the matter of military theory, and by a solidarity of spirit which  has found striking expression in the course of the numerous moves of  army corps from one part of the theatre of operations to another, which  have been carried out since the beginning of the war.    The cavalry after six months of war still possesses an excess of  officers. There are on an average thirty-six officers to a regiment  instead of the thirty-one considered to be the necessary minimum. The  artillery, which has suffered relatively little, has also an excess of  officers, and is further able to count upon a large number of Captains  and other officers, who before the war were employed in the arsenals or  in technical research. Finally the reserve artillery officers have  nearly all proved to be excellent battery commanders.    The losses in the junior commissioned ranks have naturally been highest  in the infantry. There is, however, nothing like a want of officers in  this arm. Many Captains and Lieutenants who have been wounded by  machine-gun fire (such wounds are usually slight and quickly healed,)  have been able to return speedily to the front. The reserve officers  have in general done remarkably well, and in many cases have shown quite  exceptional aptitude for the rank of company commanders. The  non-commissioned officers promoted to sub-Lieutenancies make excellent  section leaders, and even show themselves very clever and energetic  company commanders in the field.    It must be remembered also that thanks to the intellectual and physical  development of the generation now serving with the colors; and thanks,  above all, to the warlike qualities of the race, and the democratic  spirit of our army, we have been able to draw upon the lower grades and  even upon the rank and file for officers. Many men who began the war on  Aug. 2 as privates, now wear the officers' epaulettes. The elasticity of  our regulations regarding promotion in war time, the absence of the  spirit of caste, and the friendly welcome extended by all officers to  those of their military inferiors who have shown under fire their  fitness to command, have enabled us to meet all requirements.    The state of our infantry on Jan. 15 was very satisfactory and much  superior to that of the German infantry. On an average each of our  regiments has forty-eight officers, including eighteen regular officers,  fifteen reserve officers, and fifteen non-commissioned officers. In each  regiment six of the twelve companies are commanded by Captains who are  regular officers, three by Captains of the reserve and three by  Lieutenants. Each company has at least three officers. The state of the  army as regards the commissioned ranks from the highest to the lowest is  declared to be exceptionally brilliant. The army is led by young,  well-trained, and daring chiefs, and the lower commissioned ranks have  acquired the art of war by experience.      2,500,000 FRENCH AT FRONT.    Including all ranks, France now has more than 2,500,000 men at the  front, and every unit is, or was on Jan. 15, at war strength. The  infantry companies are at least 200 strong. In many regiments the  companies have a strength of 250 or more.    In other arms, which have suffered less than the infantry, the units are  all up to, or above, regulation strength.    This fact constitutes one of the most important advantages of the French  Army over the Germans. While Germany has created a great number of new  units, army corps or divisions, which absorbed at a blow all of her  available resources in officers and men, the French supreme command has  avoided the formation of new units, except in limited number, and has  only admitted exceptions to this rule when it was able to count with  certainty on being able to provide amply for both the present and future  requirements of the new units, as regards all ranks, without encroaching  upon the reserves needed for the existing units.    At the same time, thanks to the depots in the interior of the country,  the effectives at the front have been maintained at full strength. The  sources of supply for this purpose were the remainder of the eleven  classes of the reserves, the younger classes of the territorial army,  and the new class of 1914. A large number of the men wounded in the  earlier engagements of the war have been able to return to the front.  They have been incorporated in the new drafts, providing these with a  useful stiffening of war-tried men.    With regard to the supplies of men upon which the army can draw to  repair the wastage at the front, we learn that there are practically  half as many men in the depots as at the front, in other words about  1,250,000. Further supplies of men are provided by the class of 1915 and  the revision of the various categories of men of military age previously  exempted on grounds of health or for other reasons from the duty of  bearing arms. As a result of this measure nearly half a million men have  been claimed for the army, almost all of whom, after rigorous physical  tests, have been declared fit for military service.      DRILLED BY CONVALESCENTS.    In the depots in which the new soldiers are being trained the services  of many officers and non-commissioned officers discharged as  convalescents after being wounded are utilized in order to give a  practical turn to the instruction. There are still many voluntary  enlistments, and with all these resources of men the army can count upon  reinforcements soon to be available which will considerably augment its  offensive power.    The quality of the troops has improved perceptibly since the beginning  of the war. The men have become hardened and used to war, and their  health--largely owing to the excellence of the commissariat--is  extremely satisfactory. In spite of the severity of the Winter hardly  any cases of disease of the respiratory organs have occurred, and the  sanitary returns of the army show an appreciable improvement on those of  the preceding Winter.    With regard to the reserves, experience has verified the dictum of the  Serbian and Bulgarian Generals in the war of 1913, namely, that \"two  months in the field are necessary in order to get at the full value of  reserves.\" Our infantry is now accustomed to the rapid and thorough  \"organization\" of the defensive. In August it neither liked nor had the  habit of using the spade. Today those who see our trenches are  astounded. They are veritable improvised fortresses, proof against the  77-millimeter gun and often against artillery of higher calibre. During  the last five months not a single encounter can be cited in which our  infantry did not have the advantage over the German infantry. All the  enemy's attacks have been repulsed, except to the north of Soissons,  where their success was due to the flooded state of the Aisne and the  carrying away of our bridges. Our attacks, on the other hand, have  yielded important results, and have been carried out with plenty of  spirit, although without the imprudence which cost us such heavy losses  in August.    The cavalry has made remarkable progress.

The submarine  was in sight for about five minutes, when she submerged about right  ahead of us. I saw her, but could not distinguish or see any flag flying  on her.    The Gulflight was then steering about true east, steaming about eight  miles an hour, flying a large American ensign, six feet by ten feet.  The wind was about south, about eight miles an hour in force. I  personally observed our flag was standing out well to the breeze.    Immediately after seeing the submarine I went aft and notified the crew  and came back and went on the bridge and heard the Captain make the  remark that that must be a British submarine, as the patrol boats took  no notice of it.    About 12:50 an explosion took place in the Gulflight on the bluff of the  starboard bow, sending vast quantities of water high in the air, coming  down on the bridge and shutting everything off from our view. After the  water cleared away our ship had sunk by the head so that the sea was  washing over the foredeck, and the ship appeared to be sinking.    Immediately after I went aft to see to the boats. On my way I saw one  man overboard on the starboard side. The water at that time was black  with oil. The boats were lowered and the crew got into them without  delay or damage. After ascertaining there was no one left on board the  ship I got in my boat and we were picked up by the patrol vessel Iago  and were advised by her crew to leave the scene. We proceeded toward St.  Mary's, but the dense fog which then came on prevented us getting into  the harbor that night.    About 2:30 in the morning following I saw Captain Gunter, master of the  Gulflight, who had been sleeping in the room of the skipper of the Iago,  standing in the room with a queer look in his face. I asked him what his  trouble was, and he made no reply. Then he reached for the side of the  berth with his hands, but did not take hold. I went in the room, but he  fell before I reached him.    He was taken on deck, as the cabin was small and hot. After reaching the  deck he seemed to revive and said: \"I am cold.\" After that he had  apparently two fainting attacks and then expired in a third one--this  being about 3:40.    We arrived at St. Mary's, Scilly, about 10 o'clock on the morning of May  2. The Gulflight was towed to Crow Sound, Scilly, on May 2 by British  patrol vessels, and Commander Oliver, senior naval officer of the Port  of Scilly, sent for some one to come on board the Gulflight, and I went,  and the ship was anchored about 6 P.M.    I again left the ship that evening--she being then in charge of the  Admiralty. I visited the ship on Monday. I went out again on Tuesday,  but it was too rough to get on board. To the best of my knowledge there  was no examination of the vessel made by divers until Wednesday about 3  P.M., when members from the American Embassy were present. The divers at  this time made an external examination only of the ship's bottom and  left the ship with me at 5:40 P.M.          Aim of Submarine Warfare    [From The London Times, April 30, 1915.]      Dr. Flamm, Professor of Ship Construction at the Technical High School  at Charlottenburg, publishes in the Vossische Zeitung an extraordinary  article on the impending destruction of the British Empire by German  submarines. Whatever Professor Flamm's professional opinion may be  worth, he is evidently attacking his task with a passionate hatred of  England that leaves nothing to be desired.    Professor Flamm begins by explaining how England has been protected for  centuries by her insularity. He writes:         This country, whose dishonorable Government produced this       terrible world war by the most contemptible means, and solely       in selfish greed of gain, has always been able to enjoy the       fruits of its unscrupulousness because it was reckoned as       unassailable. But everything is subject to change, and that       applies today to the security of England's position. Thank       God, the time has now come when precisely its complete       encirclement by the sea has become the greatest danger for the       existence of the British Nation.    The writer explains that England cannot be self-supporting, and,  strangely enough, admits that recognition of this fact justifies British  naval policy. He proceeds:         The time, however, has passed in which even the strongest       squadron of battleships or cruisers can protect England's       frontiers and secure imports from oversea. Technical progress,       in the shape of submarines, has put into the hands of all       England's enemies the means at last to sever the vital nerve       of the much-hated enemy, and to pull him down from his       position of ruler of the world, which he has occupied for       centuries with ever-increasing ruthlessness and selfishness.       What science has once begun she continues, and for every       shipbuilder in the whole world there is now no sphere which       offers a stronger stimulus to progressive activity than the       sphere of the submarines. Here an endless amount of work is       being, and will be, done, because the reward which beckons on       the horizon is an extraordinarily high one, an extraordinarily       profitable one, a reward containing the most ideal blessings       for humanity--the destruction of English world supremacy, the       liberation of the seas. This exalted and noble aim has today       come within reach, and it is German intellect and German work       that have paved the way.    It will be noted that Professor Flamm, as other contemporary German  writers, believes that submarines, like Shakespeare, are a German  invention. He is also, notwithstanding the experience of two and a half  months, confident that the German \"submarine blockade\" will both be  successful and become popular with neutrals. Building upon the German  myth that Captain Weddigen's submarine, U-29, was destroyed while saving  life, Professor Flamm \"expects\" that the neutrals will stop all traffic  with England, \"in view of the cowardly and cunning method of fighting of  the English.\"    Professor Flamm then discusses Germany's prospects, as follows:         Anybody who wants to fight England must not attempt it by       striving to bring against England larger and more numerous       battleships and cruisers. That would be not only unwise but       also very costly. He must try another method, which makes       England's great sea power completely illusory, and gives it       practically no opportunity for activity. This method is the       cutting-off of imports by submarine fleets. Let it not be       said that the attainment of this end requires a very great       deal of material. England, as can easily be seen from the map,       possesses a fairly limited number of river mouths and ports       for rapid development of her great oversea trade. Beginning in       the northeast, those on the east coast are mainly the Firth of       Forth, the mouths of the Tyne and Humber, and then the Thames;       in the south, Portsmouth, Southampton, and Plymouth, with some       neighboring harbors; in the west, the Bristol Channel, the       Mersey, the Solway, and the Clyde. These are the entries that       have to be blocked in order to cut off imports in a way that       will produce the full impression. For this purpose 150 of the       submarines of today fully suffice, so that the goal is within       reach. Moreover, the development of this arm will enormously       increase its value, and so, come what may, England must reckon       with the fact that her world supremacy cannot much longer       exist, and that the strongest navy can make no difference.       When once the invisible necktie is round John Bull's neck, his       breathing will soon cease, and the task of successfully       putting this necktie on him is solely a question of technical       progress and of time, which now moves so fast.    Professor Flamm ends with a passage about German submarine bases. It  would be more intelligible if he had made up his mind whether Germany is  going to take Calais or whether, according to another popular German  theory, England is going to annex the north coast of France. He writes:    \"The eyes of France also will one day be opened when, having been  sufficiently weakened, she is compelled to leave the north coast of  France, including Calais, to her friend of today. Precisely this coast  which England has seized may be expected now to remain in English  possession for the purpose of better and surer control of the Channel,  for there can be no doubt that this control renders, and will render,  difficult for the German submarines effective activity in the Irish  Sea--an activity which will become all the easier as soon as Calais has  been freed of the enemy, or is even in German possession.    \"Thus before very long a world fate should befall England. The trees do  not grow up to heaven. England, through her criminal Government, has  stretched the bow too tight, and so it will snap.\"          THREE SPEECHES BY PRESIDENT WILSON           In New York at the annual luncheon of The Associated Press on       April 20, 1915; at Philadelphia in Convention Hall on May 10,       in an address to 4,000 newly naturalized citizens, and again       at New York in his speech on the navy, May 17, delivered at       the luncheon given for the President by the Mayor's Committee       formed for the naval review, Mr. Wilson set forth the       principles on which he would meet the crises of the European       war as they affect the United States.
