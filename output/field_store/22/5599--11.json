He stands aghast,  trembling with dread. BEN is violently rubbing off the organ with  a piece of cloth which he has snatched from his pocket_, CAPTAIN  KEENEY _appears in the doorway on right and comes into the cabin,  removing his fur cap as he does so. He is a man of about forty,  around five-ten in height, but looking much shorter on account of  the enormous proportions of his shoulders and chest. His face is  massive and deeply lined, with gray-blue eyes of a bleak  hardness, and a tightly clenched, thin-lipped mouth. His thick  hair is long and gray. He is dressed in a heavy blue jacket and  blue pants stuffed into his sea-boots._    _He is followed into the cabin by the_ SECOND MATE, _a rangy  six-footer with a lean, weatherbeaten face._ The MATE _is dressed  about the same as the captain. He is a man of thirty or so._)    KEENEY. (_Comes toward the_ STEWARD--_with a stern look on his  face. The_ STEWARD _is visibly frightened and the stack of dishes  rattles in his trembling hands._ KEENEY _draws back his fist and  the_ STEWARD _shrinks away. The fist is gradually lowered and_  KEENEY _speaks slowly._) 'T would be like hitting a worm. It Is  nigh on two bells, Mr. Steward, and this truck not cleared yet.    THE STEWARD (_stammering_). Y-y-yes, sir.    KEENEY. Instead of doin' your rightful work ye've been below here  gossipin' old woman's talk with that boy. (_To_ BEN _fiercely_) Get  out o' this, you! Clean up the chartroom. (BEN _darts past the_  MATE _to the open doorway._) Pick up that dish, Mr. Steward!    THE STEWARD (_doing so with difficulty_). Yes, sir.    KEENEY. The next dish you break, Mr. Steward, you take a bath in  the Bering Sea at the end of a rope.    THE STEWARD (_tremblingly_). Yes, sir.    (_He hurries out. The_ SECOND MATE _walks slowly over to the_  CAPTAIN.)    MATE. I warn't 'specially anxious the man at the wheel should  catch what I wanted to say to you, sir. That's why I asked you to  come below.    KEENEY (_impatiently_). Speak your say, Mr. Slocum.    MATE (_unconsciously lowering his voice_). I'm afeard there'll be  trouble with the hands by the look o' things. They'll likely turn  ugly, every blessed one o' them, if you don't put back. The two  years they signed up for is up to-day.    KEENEY. And d'you think you're tellin' me somethin' new, Mr.  Slocum? I've felt it in the air this long time past. D'you think  I've not seen their ugly looks and the grudgin' way they worked?    (_The door in rear is opened and_ MRS. KEENEY _stands in the  doorway. She is a slight, sweet-faced little woman primly dressed  in black. Her eyes are red from weeping and her face drawn and  pale. She takes in the cabin with a frightened glance and stands  as if fixed to the spot by some nameless dread, clasping and  unclasping her hands nervously. The two men turn and look at  her._)    KEENEY (_with rough tenderness_). Well, Annie?    MRS. KEENEY (_as if awakening from a dream_). David, I--(_She is  silent. The_ MATE _starts for the doorway._)    KEENEY (_turning to him--sharply_). Wait!    MATE. Yes, sir.    KEENEY. D'you want anything, Annie?    MRS. KEENEY (_after a pause, during which she seems to be  endeavoring to collect her thoughts_). I thought maybe--I'd go up  on deck, David, to get a breath of fresh air.    (_She stand's humbly awaiting his permission. He and the_ MATE  _exchange a significant glance._)    KEENEY. It's too cold, Annie. You'd best stay below to-day.  There's nothing to look at on deck--but ice.    MRS. KEENEY (_monotonously_). I know--ice, ice, ice! But there's  nothing to see down here but these walls.    (_She makes a gesture of loathing._)    KEENEY. You can play the organ, Annie.    MRS. KEENEY (_dully_). I hate the organ. It puts me in mind of  home.    KEENEY (_a touch of resentment in his voice_). I got it jest for  you.    MRS. KEENEY (_dully_). I know. (_She turns away from them and walks  slowly to the bench on left. She lifts up one of the curtains and  looks through a porthole; then utters an exclamation of joy._) Ah,  water! Clear water! As far as I can see! How good it looks after  all these months of ice! (_She turns round to them, her face  transfigured with joy._) Ah, now I must go upon deck and look at  it, David.    KEENEY (_frowning_). Best not to-day, Annie. Best wait for a day  when the sun shines.    MRS. KEENEY (_desperately_). But the sun never shines in this  terrible place.    KEENEY (_a tone of command in his voice_). Best not to-day, Annie.    MRS. KEENEY (_crumbling before this command--abjectly_). Very well,  David.    (_She stands there staring straight before her as if in a daze.  The two men look at her uneasily._)    KEENEY (_sharply_). Annie!    MRS. KEENEY (_dully_). Yes, David.    KEENEY. Me and Mr. Slocum has business to talk about--ship's  business.    MRS. KEENEY. Very well, David.    (_She goes slowly out, rear, and leaves the door three quarters  shut behind her._)    KEENEY. Best not have her on deck if they's goin' to be any  trouble.    MATE. Yes, sir.    KEENEY. And trouble they's goin' to be. I feel it in my bones.    (_Takes a revolver from the pocket of his coat and examines it._)    Got yourn?    MATE. Yes, sir.    KEENEY. Not that we'll have to use 'em--not if I know their breed  of dog--jest to frighten 'em up a bit. (_Grimly_) I ain't never  been forced to use one yit; and trouble I've had by land and by  sea's long as I kin remember, and will have till my dyin' day, I  reckon.    MATE (_hesitatingly_). Then you ain't goin'--to turn back?    KEENEY. Turn back! Mr. Slocum, did you ever hear o' me pointin'  s'uth for home with only a measly four hundred barrel of ile in  the hold?    MATE (_hastily_). No, sir--but the grub's gittin' low.    KEENEY. They's enough to last a long time yit, if they're careful  with it; and they's plenty o' water.    MATE. They say it's not fit to eat--what's left; and the two  years they signed on fur is up to-day. They might make trouble  for you in the courts when we git home.    KEENEY. To hell with 'em! Let them make what law trouble they  kin. I don't give a damn 'bout the money. I've got to git the  ile! (_Glancing sharply at the_ MATE) You ain't turnin' no damned  sea lawyer, be you, Mr. Slocum?    MATE (_flushing_). Not by a hell of a sight, sir.    KEENEY. What do the fools want to go home fur now? Their share o'  the four hundred barrel wouldn't keep 'em in chewin' terbacco.    MATE (_slowly_). They wants to git back to their folks an' things,  I s'pose.    KEENEY (_looking at him searchingly_). 'N' you want to turn back,  too. (THE MATE _looks down confusedly before his sharp gaze._)  Don't lie, Mr. Slocum. It's writ down plain in your eyes. (_With  grim sarcasm_) I hope, Mr. Slocum, you ain't agoin' to jine the  men agin me.    MATE (_indignantly_). That ain't fair, sir, to say sich things.    KEENEY (_with satisfaction_). I warn't much afeard o' that, Tom.  You been with me nigh on ten year and I've learned ye whalin'. No  man kin say I ain't a good master, if I be a hard one.    MATE. I warn't thinkin' of myself, sir--'bout turnin' home, I  mean. (_Desperately_) But Mrs. Keeney, sir--seems like she ain't  jest satisfied up here, ailin' like--what with the cold an' bad  luck an' the ice an' all.    KEENEY (_his face clouding--rebukingly but not severely_). That's  my business, Mr. Slocum. I'll thank you to steer a clear course o'  that. (_A pause._) The ice'll break up soon to no'th'rd. I could  see it startin' to-day. And when it goes and we git some sun,  Annie'll perk up. (_Another pause--then he bursts forth_) It ain't  the damned money what's keepin' me up in the Northern seas, Tom.  But I can't go back to Homeport with a measly four hundred barrel  of ile. I'd die fust. I ain't never come back home in all my days  without a full ship. Ain't that truth?    MATE. Yes, sir; but this voyage you been ice-bound, an'--    KEENEY (_scornfully_). And d' you s'pose any of 'em would believe  that--any o' them skippers I've beaten voyage after voyage? Can't  you hear 'em laughin' and sneerin'--Tibbots 'n' Harris 'n' Simms  and the rest--and all o' Homeport makin' fun o' me? \"Dave Keeney  what boasts he's the best whalin' skipper out o' Homeport comin'  back with a measly four hundred barrel of ile?\" (_The thought of  this drives him into a frenzy, and he smashes his fist down on  the marble top of the sideboard._) Hell! I got to git the ile, I  tell you. How could I figger on this ice? It's never been so bad  before in the thirty year I been a-comin' here. And now it's  breakin'up. In a couple o'days it'll be all gone. And they's  whale here, plenty of 'em. I know they is and I ain't never gone  wrong yit. I got to git the ile! I got to git it in spite of all  hell, and by God, I ain't a-goin' home till I do git it!    (_There is the sound of subdued sobbing from the door in rear. The  two men stand silent for a moment, listening. Then_ KEENEY _goes  over to the door and looks in. He hesitates for a moment as if he  were going to enter--then closes the door softly._ JOE, _the  harpooner, an enormous six-footer with a battered, ugly face,  enters from right and stands waiting for the captain to notice  him._)    KEENEY (_turning and seeing him_). Don't be standin' there like a  gawk, Harpooner. Speak up!    JOE (_confusedly_). We want--the men, sir--they want send a  depitation aft to have a word with you.    KEENEY (_furiously_). Tell 'em to go to--(_checks himself and  continues grimly_) Tell'em to come. I'll see'em.    JOE. Aye, aye, sir.    (_He goes out._)    KEENEY (_with a grim smile_). Here it comes, the trouble you spoke  of, Mr. Slocum, and we'll make short shift of it. It's better to  crush such things at the start than let them make headway.    MATE (_worriedly_). Shall I wake up the First and Fourth, sir? We  might need their help.    KEENEY. No, let them sleep.

You may put a little  Ginger into it, onely to give it a taste thereof, and let it have a little  walm of heat after it. Then take and put it into a Woodden vessel, (which  must be well scalded, least it taste of any thing) let it stand all night,  and the next morning strain it through a sieve of hair.    Then if you please, you may boil up your grounds that are in the bottome of  the vessel with three or four quarts of water; and when it is cold, strain  it, to the rest, and put to it a little good light barm. That which you  make in the winter, you must let it stand three days and three nights  covered up, before you bottle it up; and two nights in summer, and then  bottle it up. But be sure, you scum off the barm before the bottling up.    Your Vessel, which you intend to boil your Meath in, must stand in  scalding water, whilst you boil your Meath; it will drink up the less of  your Meath. Four spoonfuls of good new Ale-barm will serve for five quarts  of honey. As you desire your Metheglin in strength, so take at the first  either of the quantities of water. Five quarts is reasonable.      HYDROMEL AS I MADE IT WEAK FOR THE QUEEN MOTHER    Take 18 quarts of spring-water, and one quart of honey; when the water is  warm, put the honey into it. When it boileth up, skim it very well, and  continue skimming it, as long as any scum will rise. Then put in one Race  of Ginger (sliced in thin slices,) four Cloves, and a little sprig of green  Rosemary. Let these boil in the Liquor so long, till in all it have boiled  one hour. Then set it to cool, till it be blood-warm; and then put to it a  spoonful of Ale-yest. When it is worked up, put it into a vessel of a fit  size; and after two or three days, bottle it up. You may drink it after six  weeks, or two moneths.    Thus was the Hydromel made that I gave the Queen, which was exceedingly  liked by everybody.      SEVERAL WAYS OF MAKING METHEGLIN    Take such quantity as you judge convenient of Spring, or pure rain water,  and make it boil well half an hour. Then pour it out into a Woodden fat,  and let it settle 74 hours. Then power off the clear, leaving the sediment  in the bottome. Let such water be the Liquor for all the several  Honey-drinks, you will make.    1. Warm sixteen Gallons of this water (lukewarm) and put two Gallons of  Honey to it, in a half tub or other fit Woodden vessel. Lave it very well  with a clean arm, or woodden battle-door for two or three hours, dissolving  the honey very well in the water. Let it stand thus two or three days in  wood, laving it thrice a day, a pretty while each time. Then put it back  into your Copper and boil it gently, till you have scummed away all the  foulness that will rise; and clarifie it with whites of Eggs: Then put into  it a little handful of cleansed and sliced white Ginger, and a little mace;  when they have boiled enough, put in a few Cloves bruised, and a stick of  Cinamon, and a little Limmon-peel, and after a walm or two, pour the Liquor  into a woodden half tub, with the spices in it. Cover it close with a Cloth  and blanquet, and let it stand so two days. Then let the liquor run through  a bolter, to sever the spice, stopping before any settlings come. Then pour  this clear liquor into pottle-bottles of glass, not filling them by a  fingers breadth or more. Stop them close with Cork tied in, and set them in  a cool place for 6, 7 or 8 weeks.    2. In fourty Gallons of the first boiled and settled water, boil five  handfuls of sweet-bryar tops, as much of Cowslip-flowers, as much of  Primrose-flowers, as much of Rosemary-flowers, as much of Sage-flowers, as  many of Borage-flowers, as many of Bugloss-flowers; two handfuls of the  tops of Betony, four handfuls of Agrimony, and as many of Scabious, one  handful of Thyme, as much of Sweet-marjoram, and two ounces of Mustard-seed  bruised. When this hath boiled so long, that you judge the water hath drawn  out all the vertue of the Herbs (which may be in half an hour) pour out all  into a vatte to cool and settle. Scum away the herbs, and pour the clear  from the sediment, and to every four gallons of liquor (luke-warm) put one  gallon of honey, and lave it to dissolve the honey, letting it stand two or  three days, laving it well thrice every day. Then boil it till it will bear  an Egge high, then clarifie it with whites and shells of Eggs, and pour it  into a vatte to cool, which it will do in a days space or better. Whilst it  is yet luke-warm, put Ale-yest to it, (no more then is necessary) to make  it work, and then tun it into a Rundlet of a fit Size, that hath been  seasoned with Sack; and hang in it a boulter bag containing half a pound of  white Ginger cleansed and sliced, three ounces of Cloves and as much of  Cinamon bruised, as much Coriander seed prepared, and as much  Elder-flowers. As it purgeth and consumeth by running over the bung, put in  fresh honey-liquor warmed, that you keep or make on purpose for that end.  When the working is even almost at an end, stop it up close with clay and  sand, and have great care to keep it always close stopped. After a year  draw in into pottle Glass-bottles stopped with ground stoppels of glass,  and keep them in a cool place, till they are ready to drink, if they as yet  be not so.    Have a care, that never any Liquor stay in Copper longer then whilst it is  to boil.    3. In 20 Gallons of the first boiled and settled water, boil six handfuls  of Sweet-bryar-leaves, as many of Cowslip flowers, as many of  Primrose-flowers, and as many of Rosemary-flowers; and half a handful of  Wild thyme, during the space of a quarter or half an hour. Then take the  clear, and dissolve in it a sixth part of honey, doing as above for the  boiling and clarifying it. But boil it not to bear an Egge, but onely till  it be well scummed and clarified. Then pour it into a woodden Tub, and Tun  it with Ale-yest, when it is in due temper of coolness, as you would do  Ale-wort; and let it work (close covered) sufficiently. Then Tun it up into  a seasoned firkin, and put into it a tost of white-bread spread with quick  Mustard, and hang it in a boulter bag containing loosly some Ginger, Cloves  and Cinamon bruised, and a little Limon-peel and Elder-flowers, with a  Pebble-stone at the bottome, to make it sink towards the bottom, and  fastned by a string coming out of the bung to hinder it from falling quite  to the bottome. Stop the bung very close, and after six weeks or two  moneths draw it into bottles.    4. In 20 Gallons of boiled and settled water, boil a quarter of an hour ten  handfuls of sweet bryar-leaves, and as many of Cowslips. Then let it cool  and settle in wood, and take the clear; and to every four Gallons of  Liquor, put one of honey, dissolving it as the others formerly set down.  Boil it, till no more scum rise, and that a fourth part be consumed. Then  clarifie it with whites of Eggs and their shells, and make it work with  yest. After sufficient working Tun it up, hanging it in a bag with Ginger,  Cloves, Cinamon and Limon-peel. Stop it very close, and after two or three  moneths, draw it into bottles.      MY LADY MORICES MEATH    Boil first your water with your herbs. Those she likes best, are, Angelica,  Balm, Borage, and a little Rosemary (not half so much as of any of the  rest) a handful of all together, to two or 3 Gallons of water. After about  half an hours boiling, let the water run through a strainer (to sever the  herbs from it) into Woodden or earthen vessels, and let it cool and settle.  To three parts of the clear, put one or more of honey, and boil it till it  bear an Egge, leaving as broad as a shilling out of the water, skiming it  very well. Then power it out into vessels, as before; and next day, when it  is almost quite cold, power it into a Sack-cask, wherein you have first put  a little fresh Ale-yest, about two spoonfuls to ten Gallons. Hang it in a  bag with a little sliced Ginger, but almost a Porengerfull of Cloves. Cover  the bung lightly, till it have done working; then stop it up close. You may  tap and draw it a year or two after. It is excellent good.      MY LADY MORICE HER SISTER MAKES HER'S THUS:    Dissolve your honey in the water till it bear an Egge higher or lower,  according to the strength you will have it of. Then put into it some  Sea-wormwood and a little Rosemary, and a little Sage; about too good  handfuls of all together, to ten Gallons. When it hath boiled enough to  take the vertue of the herbs, skim them out, and strew a handful or two of  fine Wheat-flower upon the boyling Liquor.    This will draw all the dregs to it, and swim at the top, so that you may  skim all off together. And this she holdeth the best way of clarifying the  Liquor, and making it look pale. Then pour it into vessels as above to  cool. Let it stand three days; then Tun it up into a Sack cask without yest  or Spice, and keep it stopped till it work. Then let it be open, till it  have done working, filling it up still with other honey-drink. Then stop it  up close for a year or two. You may at first stop it so, that the strong  working may throw out the stopple, and yet keep it close, till it work  strongly. She saith, that such a small proportion of wormwood giveth it a  fine quick tast, and a pale colour with an eye of green. The wormwood must  not be so much, as to discern any the least bitterness in the taste; but  that the composition of it with the honey may give a quickness. The  Rosemary and Sage must be a great deal less then the Wormwood. Sometimes  she stoppeth it up close as soon as she hath Tunned it, and lets it remain  so for three moneths. Then pierce it and draw it"]]]
