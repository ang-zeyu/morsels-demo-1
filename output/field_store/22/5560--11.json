Had she been an acceptable  sacrifice, after the fire had touched her, the river would have  received her'. This satisfied the whole crowd. The father said that,  after this unanswerable argument, he would receive his daughter; and  the whole crowd dispersed satisfied.[12]    The following conversation took place one morning between me and a  native gentleman at Jubbulpore soon after suttees had been prohibited  by Government:--    'What are the castes among whom women are not permitted to remarry  after the death of their husbands?'    'They are, sir, Brahmans, Rajputs, Baniyas (shopkeepers), Kayaths  (writers).'    'Why not permit them to marry, now that they are no longer permitted  to burn themselves with the dead bodies of their husbands?'    'The knowledge that they cannot unite themselves to a second husband  without degradation from caste, tends strongly to secure their  fidelity to the first, sir. Besides, if all widows were permitted to  marry again, what distinction would remain between us and people of  lower caste? We should all soon sink to a level with the lowest.'    'And so you are content to keep up your caste at the expense of the  poor widows?'    'No; they are themselves as proud of the distinction as their  husbands are.'    'And would they, do you think, like to hear the good old custom of  burning themselves restored?'    'Some of them would, no doubt.'    'Why?'    'Because they become reunited to their husbands in paradise, and are  there happy, free from all the troubles of this life.'    'But you should not let them have any troubles as widows.'    'If they behave well, they are the most honoured members of their  deceased husbands' families; nothing in such families is ever done  without consulting them, because all are proud to have the memory of  their lost fathers, sons, and brothers so honoured by their  widows.[13] But women feel that they are frail, and would often  rather burn themselves than be exposed all their lives to temptation  and suspicion.'    'And why do not the men burn themselves to avoid the troubles of  life?'    'Because they are not called to it from Heaven, as the women are.'    'And you think that the women were really called to be burned by the  Deity?'    'No doubt; we all believe that they were called and supported by the  Deity; and that no tender beings like women could otherwise  voluntarily undergo such tortures--they become inspired with  supernatural powers of courage and fortitude. When Duli Sukul, the  Sihora[14] banker's father, died, the wife of a Lodhi cultivator of  the town declared, all at once, that she had been a suttee with him  six times before; and that she would now go into paradise with him a  seventh time. Nothing could persuade her from burning herself. She  was between fifty and sixty years of age, and had grandchildren, and  all her family tried to persuade her that it must be a mistake, but  all in vain. She became a suttee, and was burnt the day after the  body of the banker.'    'Did not Duli Sukul's family, who were Brahmans, try to dissuade her  from it, she being a Lodhi, a very low caste?'    'They did; but they said all things were possible with God; and it  was generally believed that this was a call from Heaven.'    'And what became of the banker's widow?'    'She said that she felt no divine call to the flames. This was thirty  years ago; and the banker was about thirty years of age when he  died.'    'Then he will have rather an old wife in paradise?'    'No, sir; after they pass through the flames upon earth, both become  young in paradise.'    'Sometimes women used to burn themselves with any relic of a husband,  who had died far from home, did they not?'    'Yes, sir, I remember a fisherman, about twenty years ago, who went  on some business to Benares from Jubbulpore, and who was to have been  back in two months. Six months passed away without any news of him;  and at last the wife dreamed that he had died on the road, and began  forthwith, in the middle of the night, to call out \"Sat, sat, sat!\"  Nothing could dissuade her from burning; and in the morning a pile  was raised for her, on the north bank of the large tank of  Hanuman,[15] where you have planted an avenue of trees. There I saw  her burned with her husband's turban in her arms, and in ten days  after her husband came back.'    'Now the burning has been prohibited, a man cannot get rid of a bad  wife so easily?'    'But she was a good wife, sir, and bad ones do not often become  suttees.'    'Who made the pile for her?'    'Some of her family, but I forget who. They thought it must have been  a call from Heaven, when, in reality, it was only a dream.'    'You are a Rajput?'    'Yes.'    'Do Rajputs in this part of India now destroy their female infants?'    'Never; that practice has ceased everywhere in these parts; and is  growing into disuse in Bundelkhand, where the Rajas, at the request  of the British Government, have prohibited it among their subjects.  This was a measure of real good. You see girls now at play in  villages, where the face of one was never seen before, nor the voice  of one heard.'    'But still those who have them grumble, and say that the Government  which caused them to be preserved should undertake to provide for  their marriage. Is it not so?'    'At first they grumbled a little, sir; but as the infants grew on  their affections, they thought no more about it.'[16]       Gurcharan Baboo, the Principal of the little Jubbulpore College,[17]  called upon me one forenoon, soon after this conversation. He was  educated in the Calcutta College; speaks and writes English  exceedingly well; is tolerably well read in English literature, and  is decidedly a _thinking man_. After talking over the matter which  caused his visit, I told him of the Lodhi woman's burning herself  with the Brahman banker at Sihora, and asked him what he thought of  it. He said that 'In all probability this woman had really been the  wife of the Brahman in some former birth--of which transposition a  singular case had occurred in his own family.      'His great-grandfather had three wives, who all burnt themselves with  his body. While they were burning, a large serpent came up, and,  ascending the pile, was burnt with them. Soon after another came up,  and did the same. They were seen by the whole multitude, who were  satisfied that they had been the wives of his great-grandfather in a  former birth, and would become so again after this sacrifice. When  the \"sraddh\", or funeral obsequies, were performed after the  prescribed intervals,[18] the offerings and prayers were regularly  made for _six souls_ instead of four; and, to this day, every member  of his family, and every Hindoo who had heard the story, believed  that these two serpents had a just right to be considered among his  ancestors, and to be prayed for accordingly in all \"sraddh\".'    A few days after this conversation with the Principal of the  Jubbulpore College, I had a visit from Bholi Sukul, the present head  of the Sihora banker's family, and youngest brother of the Brahman  with whose ashes the Lodhi woman burned herself. I requested him to  tell me all that he recollected about this singular suttee, and he  did so as follows:    'When my eldest brother, the father of the late Duli Sukul, who was  so long a native collector under you in this district, died about  twenty years ago at Sihora, a Lodhi woman, who resided two miles  distant in the village of Khitoli, which has been held by our family  for several generations, declared that she would burn herself with  him on the funeral pile; that she had been his wife in three  different births, had already burnt herself with him three times, and  had to burn with him four times more. She was then sixty years of  age, and had a husband living [of] about the same age. We were all  astounded when she came forward with this story, and told her that it  must be a mistake, as we were Brahmans, while she was a Lodhi. She  said that there was no mistake in the matter; that she, in the last  birth, resided with my brother in the sacred city of Benares, and one  day gave a holy man who came to ask charity salt, by mistake, instead  of sugar, with his food. That, in consequence, he told her she  should, in the next birth, be separated from her husband, and be of  inferior caste; but that, if she did her duty well in that state, she  should be reunited to him in the following birth. We told her that  all this must be a dream, and the widow of my brother insisted that,  if she were not allowed to burn herself, the other should not be  allowed to take her place. We prevented the widow from ascending the  pile, and she died at a good old age only two years ago at Sihora. My  brother's body was burned at Sihora, and the poor Lodhi woman came  and stole one handful of the ashes, which she placed in her bosom,  and took back with her to Khitoli. There she prevailed upon her  husband and her brother to assist her in her return to her former  husband and caste as a Brahman. No soul else would assist them, as we  got the then native chief to prohibit it; and these three persons  brought on their own heads the pile, on which she seated herself,  with the ashes in her bosom. The husband and his brother set fire to  the pile, and she was burned.'[19]    'And what is now your opinion, after a lapse of twenty years?'    'Why, that she had really been the wife of my brother; for at the  pile she prophesied that my nephew Duli should be, what his  grandfather had been, high in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15488"],[0,"Woman's Life in Colonial Days (#13)"],[1,"\"    According to Bruce's _Institutional History of Virginia in the  Seventeenth Century_[35] it would seem that the early Virginians were as  strict as the New Englanders about the matter of church attendance and  Sabbath observance. When we come across the notation that \"Sarah Purdy  was indicted 1682 for shelling corn on Sunday,\" we may feel rather sure  that during at least the first eighty years of life about Jamestown  Sunday must have been indeed a day of rest. Says Bruce: \"The first  General Assembly to meet in Virginia passed a law requiring of every  citizen attendance at divine services on Sunday. The penalty imposed was  a fine, if one failed to be present. If the delinquent was a freeman he  was to be compelled to pay three shillings for each offense, to be  devoted to the church, and should he be a slave he was to be sentenced  to be whipped.\"[36]    In Georgia and the Carolinas of the later eighteenth century the  influence of Methodism--especially after the coming of Wesley and  Whitefield--was marked, while the Scotch Presbyterian and the French  Huguenots exercised a wholesome effect through their strict honesty and  upright lives. Among these two latter sects women seem to have been very  much in the back-ground, but among the Methodists, especially in  Georgia, the influence of woman in the church was certainly noticeable.  There was often in the words and deeds of Southern women in general a  note of confident trust in God's love and in a joyous future life,  rather lacking in the writings of New England. Eliza Pinckney, for  instance, when but seventeen years old, wrote to her brother George a  long letter of advice, containing such tender, yet almost exultant  language as the following: \"To be conscious we have an Almighty friend  to bless our Endeavours, and to assist us in all Difficulties, gives  rapture beyond all the boasted Enjoyments of the world, allowing them  their utmost Extent & fulness of joy. Let us then, my dear Brother, set  out right and keep the sacred page always in view.... God is Truth  itself and can't reveal naturally or supernaturally contrarieties.\"[37a]    There is a sweet reasonableness about this, very refreshing after an  investigation of witches or myriads of devils, and, on the whole, we  find much more sanity in the Southern relationship between religion and  life than in the Northern. While there was some bickering and  quarreling, especially after the arrival of Whitefield; yet such  disputes do not seem to have left the bitterness and suspicion that  followed in the trail of the church trials in Massachusetts. Indeed,  various creeds must have lived peacefully side by side; for the colonial  surveyor, de Brahm, speaks of nine different sects in a town of twelve  thousand inhabitants, and makes this further comment: \"Yet are (they)  far from being incouraged or even inclined to that disorder which is so  common among men of contrary religious sentiments in other parts of the  world.... (The) inhabitants (were) from the beginning renound for  concord, compleasance, courteousness and tenderness towards each other,  and more so towards foreigners, without regard or respect of nature and  religion.\"[37b]    Perhaps, however, by the middle of the eighteenth century religious  sanity had become the rule both North and South; for there are many  evidences at that later period of a trust in the mercy of God and  comfort in His authority. We find Abigail Adams, whose letters cover  the last twenty-five years of the eighteenth century, saying, \"That we  rest under the shadow of the Almighty is the consolation to which I  resort and find that comfort which the world cannot give.\"[38] And  Martha Washington, writing to Governor Trumbull, after the death of her  husband, says: \"For myself I have only to bow with humble submission to  the will of that God who giveth and who taketh away, looking forward  with faith and hope to the moment when I shall be again united with the  partner of my life.\"[39] In the hour when the long struggle for  independence was opening, Mercy Warren could write in all confidence to  her husband, \"I somehow or other feel as if all these things were for  the best--as if good would come out of evil--we may be brought low that  our faith may not be in the wisdom of men, but in the protecting  providence of God.\"[40] Among the Dutch of New York religion, like  eating, drinking and other common things of life, was taken in a rather  matter-of-fact way. Seldom indeed did these citizens of New Amsterdam  become so excited about doctrine as to quarrel over it; they were too  well contented with life as it was to contend over the life to be. Mrs.  Grant in _Memoirs of an American Lady_ has left us many intimate  pictures of the life in the Dutch colony. She and her mother joined her  father in New York in 1758, and through her residence at Claverach,  Albany, and Oswego gained thorough knowledge of the people, their  customs, social life and community ideas and ideals. Of their relation  to church and creed she remarks: \"Their religion, then, like their  original national character, had in it little of fervor or enthusiasm;  their manner of performing religious duties regular and decent, but  calm, and to more ardent imaginations might appear mechanical.... If  their piety, however, was without enthusiasm it was also without  bigotry; they wished others to think as they did, without showing rancor  or contempt toward those who did not.... That monster in nature, an  impious woman, was never heard of among them.\"[41]    Unlike the New England clergyman, the New York parson was almost without  power of any sort, and was at no time considered an authority in  politics, sickness, witchcraft, or domestic affairs. Mrs. Grant was  surprised at his lack of influence, and declared: \"The dominees, as  these people call their ministers, contented themselves with preaching  in a sober and moderate strain to the people; and living quietly in the  retirement of their families, were little heard of but in the pulpit;  and they seemed to consider a studious privacy as one of their chief  duties.\"[42] However, it was only in New England and possibly in  Virginia for a short time, that church and state were one, and this may  account for much of the difference in the attitudes of the preachers. In  New York the church was absolutely separate from the government, and  unless the pastor was a man of exceedingly strong personality, his  influence was never felt outside his congregation.    In conclusion, what may we say as to the general status of the colonial  woman in the church? Only in the Quaker congregation and possibly among  the Methodists in the South did colonial womanhood successfully assert  itself, and take part in the official activities of the institution. In  the Episcopal church of Virginia and the Carolinas, the Catholic Church  of Maryland and Louisiana, and the Dutch church of New York, women were  quiet onlookers, pious, reverent, and meek, freely acknowledging God in  their lives, content to be seen and not heard. In the Puritan assembly,  likewise, they were, on the surface at least, meek, silent, docile; but  their silence was deceiving, and, as shown in the witchcraft  catastrophe, was but the silence of a smouldering volcano. In the  eighteenth century, the womanhood of the land became more assertive, in  religion as in other affairs, and there is no doubt that Mercy Warren,  Eliza Pinckney, Abigail Adams, and others mentioned in these pages were  thinkers whose opinions were respected by both clergy and laymen. The  Puritan preacher did indeed declare against speech by women in the  church, and demanded that if they had any questions, they should ask  their husbands; but there came a time, and that quickly, when the voice  of woman was heard in the blood of Salem's dead.
