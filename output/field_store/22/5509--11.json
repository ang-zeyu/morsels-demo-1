High above the hills, to the left of the path,  hung a speck of gold-beater's skin. It was the Ladysmith balloon. There,  scarcely two miles away, were safety and honour. The soldiers noticed  the balloon too. 'Those are our blokes,' they said. 'We ain't all  finished yet,' and so they comforted themselves, and a young sergeant  advanced a theory that the garrison would send out cavalry to rescue us.    We kept our eyes on the balloon till it was hidden by the hills, and I  thought of all that lay at the bottom of its rope. Beleaguered  Ladysmith, with its shells, its flies, its fever, and its filth seemed  a glorious paradise to me.    We forded the Klip River breast high, and, still surrounded by our  escort, trudged on towards the laagers behind Bulwana. But it was just  three o'clock, after about ten hours' marching, that we reached the camp  where we were to remain for the night. Having had no food--except the  toasted ox, a disgusting form of nourishment--and being besides unused  to walking far, I was so utterly worn out on arrival that at first I  cared for nothing but to lie down under the shade of a bush. But after  the Field-Cornet had given us some tea and bully beef, and courteously  bidden us to share the shelter of his tent, I felt equal to further  argument.    The Boers were delighted and crowded into the small tent.    'Will you tell us why there is this war?'    I said that it was because they wanted to beat us out of South Africa  and we did not like the idea.    'Oh no, that is not the reason.' Now that the war had begun they would  drive the British into the sea; but if we had been content with what we  had they would not have interfered with us--except to get a port and  have their full independence recognised.    'I will tell you what is the real cause of this war. It's all those  damned capitalists. They want to steal our country, and they have bought  Chamberlain, and now these three, Rhodes, Beit, and Chamberlain, think  they will have the Rand to divide between them afterwards.'    'Don't you know that the gold mines are the property of the  shareholders, many of whom are foreigners--Frenchman and Germans and  others? After the war, whatever government rules, they will still belong  to these people.'    'What are we fighting for then?'    'Because you hate us bitterly, and have armed yourselves in order to  attack us, and we naturally chose to fight when we are not occupied  elsewhere. \"Agree with thine adversary whiles thou art in the way with  him.'\"    'Don't you think it wicked to try to steal our country?'    'We only want to protect ourselves and our own interests. We didn't want  your country.'    'No, but the damned capitalists do.'    'If you had tried to keep on friendly terms with us there would have  been no war. But you want to drive us out of South Africa. Think of a  great Afrikander Republic--all South Africa speaking Dutch--a United  States under your President and your Flag, sovereign and international.'    Their eyes glittered. 'That's what we want,' said one. 'Yaw, yaw,' said  the others, 'and that's what we're going to have.'    'Well, that's the reason of the war.'    'No, no. You know it's those damned capitalists and Jews who have caused  the war.' And the argument recommenced its orbit.    So the afternoon wore away.    As the evening fell the Commandant required us to withdraw to some tents  which had been pitched at the corner of the laager. A special tent was  provided for the officers, and now, for the first time, they found  themselves separated from their men. I had a moment in which to decide  whether I would rank as officer or private, and chose the former, a  choice I was soon to regret. Gradually it became night. The scene as the  daylight faded was striking and the circumstances were impressive. The  dark shadow of Bulwana mountain flung back over the Dutch camp, and the  rugged, rock-strewn hills rose about it on all sides. The great waggons  were arranged to enclose a square, in the midst of which stood clusters  of variously shaped tents and lines of munching oxen. Within the laager  and around it little fires began to glow, and by their light the figures  of the Boers could be seen busy cooking and eating their suppers, or  smoking in moody, muttering groups. All was framed by the triangular  doorway of the tent, in which two ragged, bearded men sat nursing their  rifles and gazing at their captives in silence. Nor was it till my  companions prepared to sleep that the stolid guards summoned the energy  and wit to ask, in struggling English (for these were real veldt  Boers), the inevitable question, 'And after all, what are we fighting  for? Why is there this war?' But I was tired of arguing, so I said, 'It  is the will of God,' and turned to rest with a more confident feeling  than the night before, for I felt that these men were wearying of the  struggle.    To rest but not to sleep, for the knowledge that the British lines at  Ladysmith lay only five miles away filled my brain with hopes and plans  of escape. I had heard it said that all Dutchmen slept between 12 and 2  o'clock, and I waited, trusting that our sentries would observe the  national custom. But I soon saw that I should have been better situated  with the soldiers. We three officers were twenty yards from the laager,  and around our little tent, as I learned by peering through a rent in  the canvas, no less than four men were posted. At intervals they were  visited or relieved, at times they chatted together; but never for a  minute was their vigilance relaxed, and the continual clicking of the  Mauser breech bolts, as they played with their rifles, unpleasantly  proclaimed their attention. The moon was full and bright, and it was  obvious that no possible chance of success awaited an attempt.    With the soldiers the circumstances were more favourable. Their tent  stood against the angle of the laager, and although the sentries watched  the front and sides it seemed to me that a man might crawl through the  back, and by walking boldly across the laager itself pass safely out  into the night. It was certainly a road none would expect a fugitive to  take; but whatever its chances it was closed to me, for the guard was  changed at midnight and a new sentry stationed between our tent and  those near the laager.    I examined him through the torn tent. He was quite a child--a boy of  about fourteen--and needless to say appreciated the importance of his  duties. He played this terrible game of soldiers with all his heart and  soul; so at last I abandoned the idea of flight and fell asleep.    In the morning, before the sun was up, the Commandant Davel came to  rouse us. The prisoners were to march at once to Elandslaagte Station.  'How far?' we asked, anxiously, for all were very footsore. 'Only a very  little way--five hours' slow walking.' We stood up--for we had slept in  our clothes and cared nothing for washing--and said that we were ready.  The Commandant then departed, to return in a few minutes bringing some  tea and bully beef, which he presented to us with an apology for the  plainness of the fare. He asked an English-speaking Boer to explain that  they had nothing better themselves. After we had eaten and were about to  set forth, Dayel said, through his interpreter, that he would like to  know from us that we were satisfied with the treatment we met with at  his laager. We gladly gave him the assurance, and with much respect bade  good-bye to this dignified and honourable enemy. Then we were marched  away over the hills towards the north, skirting the picket line round  Ladysmith to the left. Every half-mile or so the road led through or by  some Boer laager, and the occupants--for it was a quiet day in the  batteries--turned out in hundreds to look at us. I do not know how many  men I saw, but certainly during this one march not less than 5,000. Of  this great number two only offered insults to the gang of prisoners. One  was a dirty, mean-looking little Hollander. He said, 'Well, Tommy,  you've got your franchise, anyhow.' The other was an Irishman. He  addressed himself to Frankland, whose badges proclaimed his regiment.  What he said when disentangled from obscenity amounted to this: 'I am  glad to see you Dublin fellows in trouble.' The Boers silenced him at  once and we passed on. But that was all the taunting we received during  the whole journey from Frere Station to Pretoria, and when one remembers  that the Burghers are only common men with hardly any real discipline,  the fact seems very remarkable. But little and petty as it was it galled  horribly. The soldiers felt the sting and scowled back; the officers  looked straight before them. Yet it was a valuable lesson. Only a few  days before I had read in the newspapers of how the Kaffirs had jeered  at the Boer prisoners when they were marched into Pietermaritzburg,  saying, 'Where are your passes?' It had seemed a very harmless joke  then, but now I understood how a prisoner feels these things.    It was about eleven o'clock when we reached Elandslaagte Station. A  train awaited the prisoners. There were six or seven closed vans for the  men and a first-class carriage for the officers. Into a compartment of  this we were speedily bundled. Two Boers with rifles sat themselves  between us, and the doors were locked. I was desperately hungry, and  asked for both food and water. 'Plenty is coming,' they said, so we  waited patiently, and sure enough, in a few minutes a railway official  came along the platform, opened the door, and thrust before us in  generous profusion two tins of preserved mutton, two tins of preserved  fish, four or five loaves, half a dozen pots of jam, and a large can of  tea. As far as I could see the soldiers fared no worse.

Mrs. Allan, whom Poe appears to have regarded with much affection, and  who had more influence over him than any one else at this period, died on  the 27th of February, 1829, which I believe was just before Poe left  Richmond for West Point. It has been erroneously stated by all Poe's  biographers, that Mr. Allan was now sixty-five years of age, and that  Miss Paterson, to whom he was married afterward, was young enough to be  his granddaughter. Mr. Allan was in his forty-eighth year, and the  difference between his age and that of his second wife was not so great  as justly to attract any observation.    For a few weeks the cadet applied himself with much assiduity to his  studies, and he became at once a favorite with his mess and with the  officers and professors of the Academy; but his habits of dissipation  were renewed; he neglected his duties and disobeyed orders; and in ten  months from his matriculation he was cashiered.    He went again to Richmond, and was received into the family of Mr. Allan,  who was disposed still to be his friend, and in the event of his good  behavior to treat him like a son; but it soon became necessary to close  his doors against him forever. According to Poe's own statement he  ridiculed the marriage of his patron with Miss Paterson, and had a  quarrel with her; but a different story,[B] scarcely suitable for  repetition here, was told by the friends of the other party. Whatever the  circumstances, they parted in anger, and Mr. Allan from that time  declined to see or in any way to assist him. Mr. Allan died in the spring  of 1834, in the fifty-fourth year of his age, leaving three children to  share his property, of which not a mill was bequeathed to Poe.      [Footnote B: The writer of an eulogium upon the life and genius of Mr.  Poe, in the _Southern Literary Messenger_, for March, 1850, thus refers  to this point in his history:      \"The story of the other side is different: and if true, throws a dark  shade upon the quarrel, and a very ugly light upon Poe's character. We  shall not insert it, because it is one of those relations, which we  think, with Sir Thomas Browne, should never be recorded,--being  'verities whose truth we fear and heartily wish there were no truth  therein ... whose relations honest minds do deprecate. For of sins  heteroclital, and such as want name or precedent, there is ofttimes a sin  even in their history. We do desire no record of enormities: sins should  he accounted new. They omit of their monstrosity as they fall from their  rarity; for men count it venial to err with their forefathers, and  foolishly conceive they divide a sin in its society.... In things of this  nature, silence commendeth history: 'tis the veniable part of things  lost; wherein there must never arise a Pancirollus, nor remain any  register but that of hell.'\"]    Soon after he left West Point Poe had printed at Baltimore a small volume  of verses, (\"Al Aaraaf,\" of about four hundred lines, \"Tamerlane,\" of  about three hundred lines, with smaller pieces,) and the favorable manner  in which it was commonly referred to confirmed his belief that he might  succeed in the profession of literature. The contents of the book appear  to have been written when he was between sixteen and nineteen years of  age; but though they illustrated the character of his abilities and  justified his anticipations of success, they do not seem to me to evince,  all things considered, a very remarkable precocity. The late Madame  d'Ossoli refers to some of them as the productions of a boy of eight or  ten years, but I believe there is no evidence that anything of his which  has been published was written before he left the university. Certainly,  it was his habit so constantly to labor upon what he had produced--he was  at all times so anxious and industrious in revision--that his works,  whenever first composed, displayed the perfection of his powers at the  time when they were given to the press.    His contributions to the journals attracted little attention, and his  hopes of gaining a living in this way being disappointed, he enlisted  in the army as a private soldier. How long he remained in the service I  have not been able to ascertain. He was recognized by officers who had  known him at West Point and efforts were made, privately, but with  prospects of success, to obtain for him a commission, when it was  discovered by his friends that he had deserted.    He had probably found relief from the monotony of a soldier's life in  literary composition. His mind was never in repose, and without some such  resort the dull routine of camp or barracks would have been  insupportable. When he next appears, he has a volume of MS. stories,  which he desires to print under the title of \"Tales of the Folio Club.\"  An offer by the proprietor of the Baltimore _Saturday Visitor_, of two  prizes, one for the best tale and one for the best poem, induced him to  submit the pieces entitled \"MS. Found in a Bottle,\" \"Lionizing,\" \"The  Visionary,\" and three others, with \"The Coliseum,\" a poem, to the  committee, which consisted of Mr. John P. Kennedy, the author of  \"Horse-Shoe Robinson;\" Mr. J.H.B. Latrobe, and Dr. James H. Miller. Such  matters are usually disposed of in a very off-hand way: Committees to  award literary prizes drink to the payer's health in good wines, over  unexamined MSS., which they submit to the discretion of publishers, with  permission to use their names in such a way as to promote the publishers'  advantage. So perhaps it would have been in this case, but that one of  the committee, taking up a little book remarkably beautiful and distinct  in caligraphy, was tempted to read several pages; and becoming  interested, he summoned the attention of the company to the half-dozen  compositions it contained. It was unanimously decided that the prizes  should be paid to \"the first of geniuses who had written legibly.\" Not  another MS. was unfolded. Immediately the \"confidential envelope\" was  opened, and the successful competitor was found to bear the  scarcely-known name of Poe. The committee indeed awarded to him the  premiums for both the tale and the poem, but subsequently altered their  decision, so as to exclude him from the second premium, in consideration  of his having obtained the higher one. The prize tale was the \"MS. found  in a Bottle.\" This award was published on the twelfth of October, 1833.  The next day the publisher called to see Mr. Kennedy, and gave him an  account of the author, which excited his curiosity and sympathy, and  caused him to request that he should be brought to his office.  Accordingly he was introduced. The prize-money had not yet been paid, and  he was in the costume in which he had answered the advertisement of his  good fortune. Thin, and pale even to ghastliness, his whole appearance  indicated sickness and the utmost destitution. A well-worn frock-coat  concealed the absence of a shirt, and imperfect boots disclosed the want  of hose. But the eyes of the young man were luminous with intelligence  and feeling, and his voice and conversation and manner, all won upon the  lawyer's regard. Poe told his history, and his ambition, and it was  determined that he should not want means for a suitable appearance in  society, nor opportunities for just display of his abilities in  literature. Mr. Kennedy accompanied him to a clothing-store, and  purchased for him a respectable suit, with changes of linen, and sent him  to a bath, from which he returned with the suddenly regained style of a  gentleman.    His new friends were very kind to him, and availed themselves of every  Opportunity to serve him. Near the close of the year 1834 the late Mr.  T.W. White established in Richmond the _Southern Literary Messenger_. He  was a man of much simplicity, purity, and energy of character, but not a  writer, and he frequently solicited his acquaintances' literary  assistance. On receiving from him an application for an article, early in  1835, Mr. Kennedy, who was busy with the duties of his profession,  advised Poe to send one, and in a few weeks he had occasion to inclose  the following answer to a letter from Mr. White:    \"BALTIMORE, April 13, 1835.    \"_Dear Sir_: Poe did right in referring to me. He is very clever with his  pen--classical and scholarlike. He wants experience and direction, but I  have no doubt he can be made very useful to you. And, poor fellow! he is  _very_ poor. I told him to write something for every number of your  magazine, and that you might find it to your advantage to give him some  permanent employ. He has a volume of very bizarre tales in the hands of  ----, in Philadelphia, who for a year past has been promising to publish  them. This young fellow is highly imaginative, and a little given to the  _terrific_. He is at work upon a tragedy, but I have turned him to  drudging upon whatever may make money, and I have no doubt you and he  will find your account in each other.\"    In the next number of the \"Messenger\" Mr. White announced that Poe was  its editor, or in other words, that he had made arrangements with a  gentleman of approved literary taste and attainments to whose especial  management the editorial department would be confided, and it was  declared that this gentleman would \"devote his exclusive attention to  the work.\" Poe continued, however, to reside in Baltimore, and it is  probable that he was engaged only as a general contributor and a writer  of critical notices of books. In a letter to Mr. White, under the date of  the thirtieth of May, he says:    \"In regard to my critique of Mr. Kennedy's novel, I seriously feel  ashamed of what I have written. I fully"]]]
