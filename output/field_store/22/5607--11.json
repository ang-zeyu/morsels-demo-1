The number of workmen deported is  variously estimated at between one and three hundred thousand.    \"The rage, the terror, the despair\" excited by this measure all over  Belgium, our minister, Brand Whitlock, reported, \"were beyond anything  we had witnessed since the day the Germans poured into Brussels. I am  constantly in receipt of reports from all over Belgium that bear out the  stories of brutality and cruelty.    \"In tearing away from nearly every humble home in the land a husband and  a father or a son and brother, the Germans have lighted a fire of hatred  that will never go out. It is one of those deeds that make one despair  of the future of the human race, a deed coldly planned, studiously  matured, and deliberately and systematically executed, a deed so cruel  that German soldiers are said to have wept in its execution, and so  monstrous that even German officers are now said to be ashamed.\" Poland  and the occupied parts of France experienced similar treatment.

The  outstanding feature of course was the entry of the United States into  the great war--the deciding factor in the struggle. It marked the  departure of America from the traditional policy of political isolation  from Europe. History will record that it was not a voluntary, but a  forced, departure, due to the utter disregard by Germany of our rights  on the seas, at home and elsewhere.    The first thirty days of the year found the man at the head of our  government still hoping against hope, still struggling with all the odds  against him, still courageously engaged in efforts for peace. It was a  particularly trying time for President Wilson, as a large portion of his  own party and most of the nation was arrayed against him. The people in  general felt that the time for writing notes, for parleying had passed.    On December 12, 1916, Germany, in a formal note, had offered to enter  into peace negotiations, but did not specify any terms. The note  referred in boastful language to the victorious German armies. It was  rejected by the Allies as empty and insincere. The president on December  18, 1916, had addressed all the beligerents asking them to indicate  precisely the terms on which, they would make peace. Germany's reply to  this note was no more satisfactory than before. The Allies replied  demanding restorations, reparation and indemnities.    On the 22nd of January the president appeared before the senate in his  famous \"peace without victory\" address, in which he advocated a world  league for peace. His views were received sympathetically, though the  Allies pointed out that no peace based on the condition of things before  the war could be durable, and that as matters stood it would be a  virtual victory for Germany. It was the president's last effort to bring  peace to the world without resorting to armed force.    The most biased historian is bound to affirm that Woodrow Wilson  exhausted every effort not only to keep the United States honorably at  peace, but to bring about a pacific attitude and understanding among the  belligerents. When finally he saw that no argument save that of the  sword would avail, when finally the hour struck, he became the man of  the hour courageously and nobly.    After President Wilson's failure to bring about even a pacific attitude  among the warring nations, no peace appeal from any quarter calculated  to receive respectful attention was made, excepting that issued by Pope  Benedict August 15, four months after the United States had declared  war. The President summarized the Pope's proposals as follows:         \"His Holiness in substance proposes that we return to the status       existing before the war, and that then there be a general       condonation, disarmament, and a concert of nations based upon an       acceptance of the principle of arbitration; that by a similar       concert freedom of the seas be established; and that the       territorial claims of France and Italy, the perplexing problems of       the Balkan States and the restitution of Poland be left to such       conciliatory adjustments as may be possible in the new temper of       such a peace, due regard being paid to the aspirations of the       peoples whose political fortunes and affiliations will be       involved.\"    The president's reply to the Pope forcibly stated the aim of the United  States to free the world from the menace of Prussian militarism  controlled by an arrogant and faithless autocracy. Distinguishing  between the German rulers and the people, President Wilson asserted that  the United States would willingly negotiate with a government subject to  the popular will. The note disavowed any intention to dismember  countries or to impose unfair economic conditions. In part the  President's language was:         \"Responsible statesmen must now everywhere see, if they never saw       before, that no peace can rest securely upon political or economic       restrictions meant to benefit some nations and cripple or embarrass       others, upon vindictive action of any sort, or any kind of revenge       or deliberate injury. The American people have suffered intolerable       wrongs at the hands of the Imperial German Government, but they       desire no reprisal upon the German people, who have themselves       suffered all things in this war, which they did not choose. They       believe that peace should rest upon the rights of peoples, not the       rights of governments--the rights of peoples great or small, weak       or powerful--their equal right to freedom and security and self       government and to a participation upon fair terms in the economic       opportunities of the world, the German people, of course, included,       if they will accept equality and not seek domination.\"    About five weeks prior to the Pope's proposition, the Germans had again  put forth a peace feeler. On July 19, the German reichstag adopted  resolutions in favor of peace on the basis of mutual understanding and  lasting reconciliation among the nations. The resolutions sounded well  but they were accompanied by expressions to the effect that Germany in  the war was the victim of aggression and that it approved the acts of  its government. They referred to the \"men who are defending the  Fatherland,\" to the necessity of assuring the freedom of the seas, and  to the impossibility of conquering a united German nation. There was no  doubt in the mind of any neutral or any belligerent opposing Germany  that the German government was the real aggressor and that the freedom  of the seas had never been restricted except by Germany herself, hence  there was no tendency to accept this as a serious bid for peace. The  resolutions figured largely in German internal politics but were without  effect elsewhere.    Stockholm, Sweden was the scene of a number of peace conferences but as  they were engineered by socialists of an extreme type and others holding  views usually classed as anarchistic, no serious attention was paid to  them. The \"pacifists\" in the Allied and neutral countries were more or  less active, but received little encouragement. Their arguments did not  appeal to patriotism.    Going back to the beginning of the year, within a week after the  President's \"peace without victory\" speech before the senate, Germany  replied to it by announcing that beginning February 1, it would begin  unrestricted submarine warfare in certain extensive zones around the  British Isles, France and Italy. It would, however, out of the kindness  of its heart, permit the United States to use a narrow track across the  sea with a landing at Falmouth, one ship a week, provided the American  ships were painted red and white and carried various kinds of  distinguishing marks.    This of course was a direct repudiation by Germany of all the promises  she had made to the United States. The President saw the sword being  forced into his hands but he was not yet ready to seize it with all his  might. He preferred first to exhaust the expediency of an armed  neutrality. On February 3, he went before a joint session of the house  and senate and announced that Ambassador von Bernstorff had been given  his passports and all diplomatic relations with the Teuton empire  severed. On February 12, an attempt at negotiation came through the  Swiss minister who had been placed in charge of German diplomatic  interests in this country. The President promptly and emphatically  replied that no negotiations could be even considered until the  submarine order had been withdrawn.    On February 26, the lower house of congress voted formal permission for  the arming of American merchant ships as a protection against submarine  attacks, and appropriated one hundred million dollars for the arming and  insuring of the ships. A similar measure in the senate was defeated by  Senator Robert M. LaFollette of Wisconsin, acting under a loose rule of  the senate which permitted filibustering and unlimited debate. The  session of congress expired March 4, and the President immediately  called an extra session of the senate which amended its rules so that  the measure was passed.

An estimated 10  million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free  status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative  advantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France  and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods  and lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its \"tax haven\" status,  also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production  is limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be  imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.  Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.  Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as an EU  member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU  member for agricultural products.
