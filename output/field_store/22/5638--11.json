Here belongs  particularly the detestable, shameful vice of speaking behind a  person's back and slandering, to which the devil spurs us on and of  which there would be much to be said. For it is a common evil plague  that every one prefers hearing evil to hearing good of his neighbor;  and although we ourselves are so bad that we cannot suffer that any one  should say anything bad about us, but every one would much rather that  all the world should speak of him in terms of gold, yet we cannot bear  that the best is spoken about others.    Therefore, to avoid this vice we should note that no one is allowed  publicly to judge and reprove his neighbor, although he may see him  sin, unless he have a command to judge and to reprove. For there is a  great difference between these two things, judging sin and knowing sin.  You may indeed know it, but you are not to judge it. I can indeed see  and hear that my neighbor sins, but I have no command to report it to  others. Now, if I rush in, judging and passing sentence, I fall into a  sin which is greater than his. But if you know it, do nothing else  than turn your ears into a grave and cover it, until you are appointed  to be judge and to punish by virtue of your office.    Those, then, are called slanderers who are not content with knowing a  thing, but proceed to assume jurisdiction, and when they know a slight  offense of another, carry it into every corner, and are delighted and  tickled that they can stir up another's displeasure [baseness], as  swine roll themselves in the dirt and root in it with the snout. This  is nothing else than meddling with the judgment and office of God, and  pronouncing sentence and punishment with the most severe verdict. For  no judge can punish to a higher degree nor go farther than to say: \"He  is a thief, a murderer, a traitor,\" etc. Therefore, whoever presumes to  say the same of his neighbor goes just as far as the emperor and all  governments. For although you do not wield the sword, you employ your  poisonous tongue to the shame and hurt of your neighbor.    God therefore would have it prohibited that any one speak evil of  another even though he be guilty, and the latter know it right well;  much less if he do not know it, and have it only from hearsay. But you  say: Shall I not say it if it be the truth? Answer: Why do you not make  accusation to regular judges? Ah, I cannot prove it publicly, and hence  I might be silenced and turned away in a harsh manner [incur the  penalty of a false accusation]. \"Ah, indeed, do you smell the roast?\"  If you do not trust yourself to stand before the proper authorities and  to make answer, then hold your tongue. But if you know it, know it for  yourself and not for another. For if you tell it to others, although it  be true, you will appear as a liar, because you cannot prove it, and  you are, besides acting like a knave. For we ought never to deprive any  one of his honor or good name unless it be first taken away from him  publicly.    False witness, then, is everything which cannot be properly proved.  Therefore, what is not manifest upon sufficient evidence no one shall  make public or declare for truth; and in short, whatever is secret  should be allowed to remain secret, or, at any rate, should be secretly  reproved, as we shall hear. Therefore, if you encounter an idle tongue  which betrays and slanders some one, contradict such a one promptly to  his face, that he may blush thus many a one will hold his tongue who  else would bring some poor man into bad repute from which he would not  easily extricate himself. For honor and a good name are easily taken  away, but not easily restored.    Thus you see that it is summarily forbidden to speak any evil of our  neighbor, however the civil government, preachers, father and mother  excepted, on the understanding that this commandment does not allow  evil to go unpunished. Now, as according to the Fifth Commandment no  one is to be injured in body, and yet Master Hannes [the executioner]  is excepted, who by virtue of his office does his neighbor no good, but  only evil and harm, and nevertheless does not sin against God's  commandment, because God has on His own account instituted that office;  for He has reserved punishment for His own good pleasure, as He  threatens in the First Commandment, -- just so also, although no one  has a right in his own person to judge and condemn anybody, yet if they  to whose office it belongs fail to do it, they sin as well as he who  would do so of his own accord, without such office. For here necessity  requires one to speak of the evil, to prefer charges, to investigate  and testify; and it is not different from the case of a physician who  is sometimes compelled to examine and handle the patient whom he is to  cure in secret parts. Just so governments, father and mother, brothers  and sisters, and other good friends, are under obligation to each other  to reprove evil wherever it is needful and profitable.    But the true way in this matter would be to observe the order  according to the Gospel, Matt. 18, 15, where Christ says: If thy  brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between  thee and him alone. Here you have a precious and excellent teaching for  governing well the tongue, which is to be carefully observed against  this detestable misuse. Let this, then, be your rule, that you do not  too readily spread evil concerning your neighbor and slander him to  others, but admonish him privately that he may amend [his life].  Likewise, also, if some one report to you what this or that one has  done, teach him, too, to go and admonish him personally if he have seen  it himself; but if not, that he hold his tongue.    The same you can learn also from the daily government of the  household. For when the master of the house sees that the servant does  not do what he ought, he admonishes him personally. But if he were so  foolish as to let the servant sit at home, and went on the streets to  complain of him to his neighbors, he would no doubt be told: \"You fool,  what does that concern us? Why do you not tell it to him ?\" Behold,  that would be acting quite brotherly, so that the evil would be stayed,  and your neighbor would retain his honor. As Christ also says in the  same place: If he hear thee, thou host gained thy brother. Then you  have done a great and excellent work; for do you think it is a little  matter to gain a brother? Let all monks and holy orders step forth,  with all their works melted together into one mass, and see if they  can boast that they have gained a brother.    Further, Christ teaches: But if he will not hear thee, then take with  thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every  word may be established. So he whom it concerns is always to be treated  with personally, and not to be spoken of without his knowledge. But if  that do not avail, then bring it publicly before the community, whether  before the civil or the ecclesiastical tribunal. For then you do not  stand alone, but you have those witnesses with you by whom you can  convict the guilty one, relying on whom the judge can pronounce  sentence and punish. This is the right and regular course for checking  and reforming a wicked person. But if we gossip about another in all  corners and stir the filth, no one will be reformed, and afterwards  when we are to stand up and bear witness, we deny having said so.  Therefore it would serve such tongues right if their itch for slander  were severely punished, as a warning to others. If you were acting for  your neighbor's reformation or from love of the truth, you would not  sneak about secretly nor shun the day and the light.    All this has been said regarding secret sins. But where the sin is  quite public so that the judge and everybody know it you can without  any sin avoid him and let him go, because he has brought himself into  disgrace, and you may also publicly testify concerning him. For when a  matter is public in the light of day, there can be no slandering or  false judging or testifying; as, when we now reprove the Pope with his  doctrine, which is publicly set forth in books and proclaimed in all  the world. For where the sin is public, the reproof also must be  public, that every one may learn to guard against it.    Thus we have now the sum and general understanding of this  commandment, to wit, that no one do any injury with the tongue to his  neighbor, whether friend or foe, nor speak evil of him, no matter  whether it be true or false, unless it be done by commandment or for  his reformation, but that every one employ his tongue and make it serve  for the best of every one else, to cover up his neighbor's sins and  infirmities, excuse them, palliate and garnish them with his own  reputation. The chief reason for this should be the one which Christ  alleges in the Gospel, in which He comprehends all commandments  respecting our neighbor, Matt. 7, 12: Whatsoever ye would that men  should do to you, do ye even so to them.    Even nature teaches the same thing in our own bodies, as St. Paul  says, 1 Cor. 12, 22: Much more, those members of the body which seem to  be more feeble are necessary; and those members of the body which we  think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor;  and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. No one covers his  face, eyes, nose, and mouth, for they, being in themselves the most  honorable members which we have, do not require it. But the most infirm  members, of which we are ashamed, we cover with all diligence; hands,  eyes, and the whole body must help to cover and conceal them. Thus also  among ourselves should we adorn whatever blemishes and infirmities we  find in our neighbor, and serve and help him to promote his honor to  the best of our ability, and, on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17221"],[0,"History of the Plague in London (#13)"],[1,"danger, except when they  dug the great pit in the churchyard of our parish of Aldgate. A terrible  pit it was, and I could not resist my curiosity to go and see it. As  near as I may judge, it was about forty feet in length, and about  fifteen or sixteen feet broad, and at the time I first looked at it  about nine feet deep. But it was said they dug it near twenty feet deep  afterwards, in one part of it, till they could go no deeper for the  water; for they had, it seems, dug several large pits before this; for,  though the plague was long a-coming[109] to our parish, yet, when it did  come, there was no parish in or about London where it raged with such  violence as in the two parishes of Aldgate and Whitechapel.    I say they had dug several pits in another ground when the distemper  began to spread in our parish, and especially when the dead carts began  to go about, which was not in our parish till the beginning of August.  Into these pits they had put perhaps fifty or sixty bodies each; then  they made larger holes, wherein they buried all that the cart brought in  a week, which, by the middle to the end of August, came to from two  hundred to four hundred a week. And they could not well dig them larger,  because of the order of the magistrates, confining them to leave no  bodies within six feet of the surface; and the water coming on at about  seventeen or eighteen feet, they could not well, I say, put more in one  pit. But now, at the beginning of September, the plague raging in a  dreadful manner, and the number of burials in our parish increasing to  more than was[110] ever buried in any parish about London of no larger  extent, they ordered this dreadful gulf to be dug, for such it was  rather than a pit.    They had supposed this pit would have supplied them for a month or more  when they dug it; and some blamed the churchwardens for suffering such a  frightful thing, telling them they were making preparations to bury the  whole parish, and the like. But time made it appear, the churchwardens  knew the condition of the parish better than they did: for, the pit  being finished the 4th of September, I think they began to bury in it  the 6th, and by the 20th, which was just two weeks, they had thrown into  it eleven hundred and fourteen bodies, when they were obliged to fill it  up, the bodies being then come to lie within six feet of the surface. I  doubt not but there may be some ancient persons alive in the parish who  can justify the fact of this, and are able to show even in what place of  the churchyard the pit lay, better than I can: the mark of it also was  many years to be seen in the churchyard on the surface, lying in length,  parallel with the passage which goes by the west wall of the churchyard  out of Houndsditch, and turns east again into Whitechapel, coming out  near the Three Nuns Inn.    It was about the 10th of September that my curiosity led, or rather  drove, me to go and see this pit again, when there had been near four  hundred people buried in it. And I was not content to see it in the  daytime, as I had done before,--for then there would have been nothing  to have been seen but the loose earth, for all the bodies that were  thrown in were immediately covered with earth by those they called the  \"buriers,\" which at other times were called \"bearers,\"--but I resolved  to go in the night, and see some of them thrown in.    There was a strict order to prevent people coming to those pits, and  that was only to prevent infection. But after some time that order was  more necessary; for people that were infected and near their end, and  delirious also, would run to those pits wrapped in blankets, or rugs,  and throw themselves in, and, as they said, \"bury themselves.\" I cannot  say that the officers suffered any willingly to lie there; but I have  heard that in a great pit in Finsbury, in the parish of Cripplegate (it  lying open then to the fields, for it was not then walled about), many  came and threw themselves in, and expired there, before they threw any  earth upon them; and that when they came to bury others, and found them  there, they were quite dead, though not cold.    This may serve a little to describe the dreadful condition of that day,  though it is impossible to say anything that is able to give a true idea  of it to those who did not see it, other than this: that it was indeed  very, very, very dreadful, and such as no tongue can express.    I got admittance into the churchyard by being acquainted with the sexton  who attended, who, though he did not refuse me at all, yet earnestly  persuaded me not to go, telling me very seriously (for he was a good,  religious, and sensible man) that it was indeed their business and duty  to venture, and to run all hazards, and that in it they might hope to be  preserved; but that I had no apparent call to it but my own curiosity,  which, he said, he believed I would not pretend was sufficient to  justify my running that hazard. I told him I had been pressed in my mind  to go, and that perhaps it might be an instructing sight that might not  be without its uses. \"Nay,\" says the good man, \"if you will venture upon  that score, 'name of God,[111] go in; for, depend upon it, it will be a  sermon to you, it may be, the best that ever you heard in your life. It  is a speaking sight,\" says he, \"and has a voice with it, and a loud  one, to call us all to repentance;\" and with that he opened the door,  and said, \"Go, if you will.\"    His discourse had shocked my resolution a little, and I stood wavering  for a good while; but just at that interval I saw two links[112] come  over from the end of the Minories, and heard the bellman, and then  appeared a \"dead cart,\" as they called it, coming over the streets: so I  could no longer resist my desire of seeing it, and went in. There was  nobody, as I could perceive at first, in the churchyard, or going into  it, but the buriers, and the fellow that drove the cart, or rather led  the horse and cart; but when they came up to the pit, they saw a man go  to and again,[113] muffled up in a brown cloak, and making motions with  his hands, under his cloak, as if he was[114] in great agony. And the  buriers immediately gathered about him, supposing he was one of those  poor delirious or desperate creatures that used to pretend, as I have  said, to bury themselves. He said nothing as he walked about, but two or  three times groaned very deeply and loud, and sighed as[115] he would  break his heart.    When the buriers came up to him, they soon found he was neither a person  infected and desperate, as I have observed above, or a person  distempered in mind, but one oppressed with a dreadful weight of grief  indeed, having his wife and several of his children all in the cart that  was just come in with him; and he followed in an agony and excess of  sorrow. He mourned heartily, as it was easy to see, but with a kind of  masculine grief, that could not give itself vent by tears, and, calmly  desiring the buriers to let him alone, said he would only see the bodies  thrown in, and go away. So they left importuning him; but no sooner was  the cart turned round, and the bodies shot into the pit  promiscuously,--which was a surprise to him, for he at least expected  they would have been decently laid in, though, indeed, he was afterwards  convinced that was impracticable,--I say, no sooner did he see the  sight, but he cried out aloud, unable to contain himself. I could not  hear what he said, but he went backward two or three steps, and fell  down in a swoon. The buriers ran to him and took him up, and in a little  while he came to himself, and they led him away to the Pye[116] Tavern,  over against the end of Houndsditch, where, it seems, the man was known,  and where they took care of him. He looked into the pit again as he went  away; but the buriers had covered the bodies so immediately with  throwing in earth, that, though there was light enough (for there were  lanterns,[117] and candles in them, placed all night round the sides of  the pit upon the heaps of earth, seven or eight, or perhaps more), yet  nothing could be seen.    This was a mournful scene indeed, and affected me almost as much as the  rest. But the other was awful, and full of terror: the cart had in it  sixteen or seventeen bodies; some were wrapped up in linen sheets, some  in rugs, some little other than naked, or so loose that what covering  they had fell from them in the shooting out of the cart, and they fell  quite naked among the rest; but the matter was not much to them, or the  indecency much to any one else, seeing they were all dead, and were to  be huddled together into the common grave of mankind, as we may call it;  for here was no difference made, but poor and rich went together. There  was no other way of burials, neither was it possible there should,[118]  for coffins were not to be had for the prodigious numbers that fell in  such a calamity as this.    It was reported, by way of scandal upon the buriers, that if any corpse  was delivered to them decently wound up, as we called it then, in a  winding sheet tied over the head and feet (which some did, and which was  generally of good linen),--I say, it was reported that the buriers were  so wicked as to strip them in the cart, and carry them quite naked to  the ground; but as I cannot credit anything so vile among Christians,  and at a time so filled with terrors as that was, I can only relate it,  and leave it undetermined.    Innumerable stories also went about of the cruel behavior and practice  of nurses who attended the sick, and of their hastening on the fate of  those they attended in their sickness. But I shall say more of this in  its place.    I was indeed shocked with this sight, it almost overwhelmed me; and I  went away with my heart most afflicted, and full of afflicting thoughts  such as I cannot describe. Just at my going out of the church, and "]]]
