These thoughts thronged rapidly through my mind. Indeed I was obliged to  do all things quickly now for I felt that my existence depended upon my  finding water within the next three or four hours. The native sat  opposite to me on the ground, his keen savage eye watching the expression  of my countenance, as each thought flitted across it. I saw that he was  trying to read my feelings; and he at length thus broke the silence:    \"Mr. Grey, today we can walk and may yet not die but drink water;  tomorrow you and I will be two dead men, if we walk not now, for we shall  then be weak and unable. The others sit down too much; they are weak and  cannot walk: if we remain with them we shall all die; but we two are  still strong; let us walk. There lies the sea; to that the streams run;  it is long since we have crossed a river: go quickly, and before the next  sun gets up we shall cross another running water.\" He paused for a  minute, looking steadfastly at me, and then added, \"You must leave the  others, for I know not where they are, and we shall die in trying to find  them.\"    HIS DESIGNS FRUSTRATED.    I now knew that he was playing me false and that he had purposely led me  astray. He was too great a coward to move on alone for fear of other  natives and, dreading to lose his life by thirst, he had hit upon this  expedient of inducing me to abandon the others and to proceed with him.  \"Do you see the sun, Kaiber, and where it now stands?\" I replied to him.  \"Yes,\" was his answer. \"Then if you have not led me to the party before  that sun falls behind the hills I will shoot you; as it begins to sink  you die.\" I said these words, looking at him steadily in the face, and  with the full intention of putting my threat into execution. He saw this,  and yet strove to appear unconcerned, and with a forced laugh said, \"You  play. From daylight until now you and I have walked; we have wasted our  strength now in looking for water for the others. But a short time, and  we shall be dead; and you say, search for men whom I cannot find; you  tell me, look; and I know not where to look.\" I now lost all patience  with him and replied: \"Kaiber, deceive as you will, you cannot deceive  me; follow back our tracks instantly to the point from whence we started:  if you do not find them, as the sun falls you die.\" \"I am wearied,\"  answered he; \"for three days I have not either eaten or drunk, far have  we wandered since we left them, and very distant from us are they now  sitting.\" I could bear this no longer, and, starting up, said, \"You  deceive: the sun falls! just now I spoke: Koolyum, nganga dabbut--garrum  wangaga.\" Again he forced a laugh and said, \"Surely, you play.\" I  answered shortly, \"Did I ever tell you a lie, Kaiber? I now speak the  truth.\"    RETURN TO THE PARTY WITHOUT WATER.    He seemed, when he saw that I was so determined, to feel a little  uncomfortable, and shifting his position moved rather further from me;  this motion on his part induced me to conceive that he intended to run  away; in which case I could never again have hoped to rejoin the party; I  therefore instantly cocked the remaining barrel of my gun and presented  it at him, telling him that if he ever moved from me further than a  certain tree which I pointed out I would forthwith shoot him, instead of  waiting until sunset as I had originally intended. The decided manner in  which I announced this to my friend Kaiber had the desired effect. He  made a few protestations as to the folly of my conduct; lamented most  loudly that his mother, and the Dandalup (a river of his own land) were  so far removed from him; asserted vehemently that the natives of these  parts were bandy-legged, rough-tongued beings; that they eat earth and  drank no water; and, winding-up with a fervent wish that he might catch  one of them wandering anywhere between Pinjarup and Mandurup, in which  case he would spear his heart, his kidney, and his liver, he sulkily  resumed his route and led me straight back to the party in about an hour.    DISTRESSING SYMPTOMS OF EXTREME THIRST.    The men, who had been much surprised at the length of my absence, were at  first buoyed up with the hope that I had found water; but this hope had  at last died away, and they knew not what to conjecture. They were all  reduced to the last degree of weakness and want; indeed I myself was at  this period suffering from the most distressing symptoms of thirst; not  only was my mouth parched, burning, and devoid of moisture, but the  senses of sight and hearing became much affected; I could scarcely  recognise the voices of the rest; and when uncouth unnatural tones struck  upon my ear it took me some time to collect my thoughts in order to  understand what was said, somewhat in the way in which one is obliged to  act when roused suddenly from a deep sleep. In the same manner my sight  had become feeble and indistinct; but by far the most distressing  sensation was that experienced upon rising up after having rested for a  few moments. I then felt the blood rush violently to the head, and the  feeling produced was as if it were driven by a forcing-pump through all  my veins.    LAST EFFORTS.    Previously to starting again I gave the men orders, which I believed at  the time would be, to some at least, the last. I did not attempt to hide  from them the dangers which surrounded us; but stating these I  represented that matters had now arrived at such a crisis that, in the  event of any of them being unable to proceed, it would be wrong to expect  the others to halt on their account; and I therefore called upon all to  exert their utmost energies and boldly to make a last struggle for their  lives. My intention, I told them, was to proceed slowly but steadily to  the southward, and never once to halt until I dropped or reached water;  even in the event of any being unable to keep up I warned them that I  should not wait for them but still pursue a steady and undeviating course  until water was found; but as soon as I had slaked my own thirst I would  return and bring assistance to those who might have been unable to come  on with me.    PAINFUL MARCH.    Having thus imparted my intentions I ordered them to throw away every  superfluous article; and a very valuable sextant, which had hitherto been  carried turn about by Corporals Auger and Coles, was here abandoned.  These our preparations having been made we moved slowly on in sad  procession, and never shall I forget the wild and haggard looks of those  that followed me; reason had begun to hold but a very slight influence  over some, and I feel assured that had it not been for the force of that  discipline which I rigidly maintained some of the party must now have  lost their lives. As it was, not a word of complaint was heard as to the  plan I pursued or the route I took; but they all reeled and staggered  after me, the silence being only broken by groans and exclamations. I  preserved a slow uniform pace, proceeding still in a south by east  direction, that is, in a straight line for Perth. The same sandy sterile  country was around, thinly clothed with Banksia trees.    We had marched for about an hour and a quarter and in this time had only  made two miles, when we suddenly arrived upon the edge of a dried-up bed  of a sedgy swamp, which lay in the centre of a small plain, where we saw  the foot-mark of a native imprinted on the sand, and again our hearts  beat with hope, for this sign appeared to announce that we were once more  entering the regions of animal life. We soon found that another part of  the swamp was thickly marked with the footsteps of women and children;  and as no water-baskets were scattered about no doubt could exist but  that we were in the vicinity of water. We soon discovered several native  wells dug in the bed of the swamp; but these were all dry, and I began  again to fear that I was disappointed, when Kaiber suddenly started up  from a thick bed of reeds and made me a sign which was unobserved by the  others, as was evidently his intention.    FORTUNATE DISCOVERY OF A MOIST MUD-HOLE. PROVIDENTIAL SUPPLY.    I hurried up and found him with his head buried in a small hole of moist  mud, for I can call it nothing else. I very deliberately raised Kaiber by  the hair, as all expostulations to him were useless, and then called up  the others.    Kaiber had completely swelled himself out with this thick muddy liquid,  and from the mark upon the sides of the hole had evidently consumed more  than half of the total supply. I first of all took some of this moist mud  in my mouth, but finding a difficulty in swallowing it, as it was so  thick, I strained a portion through a handkerchief. We had thirsted with  an intense and burning thirst for three days and two nights, during the  greater portion of which time we had been taking violent exercise under a  fierce sun. To conceive the delight of the men when they arrived at this  little hole of mud would be difficult. Each, as he came up and cast his  wearied limbs on the ground beside the hole, uttered these words: \"Thank  God;\" and then greedily swallowed a few mouthfuls of the liquid mud,  protesting that it was the most delicious water and had a peculiar  flavour which rendered it far superior to any other he had ever tasted.    DANGER OF PERISHING FROM HUNGER.    But it required some time before their faculties were sufficiently  recovered to allow them duly to estimate the magnitude of the danger they  had escaped. The small portion of muddy water in the hole was soon  finished, and then by scraping it out clean we found that water began  slowly to trickle into it again. The men now laid themselves down almost  in a state of stupefaction, and rested by their treasured pool. I felt  however that great calls upon my energies might still arise, and  therefore,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16160"],[0,"The Treasury of Ancient Egypt (#13)"],[1,"world's history has been so gay, so light-hearted as the  ancient Egyptians; and Egyptology furnishes, perhaps, the most  convincing proof that archaeology is, or should be, a merry science, very  necessary to the gaiety of the world. I defy a man suffering from his  liver to understand the old Egyptians; I defy a man who does not  appreciate the pleasure of life to make anything of them. Egyptian  archaeology presents a pageant of such brilliancy that the archaeologist  is often carried along by it as in a dream, down the valley and over the  hills, till, Past blending with Present, and Present with Future, he  finds himself led to a kind of Island of the Blest, where death is  forgotten and only the joy of life, and life's good deeds, still remain;  where pleasure-domes, and all the ancient \"miracles of rare device,\"  rise into the air from above the flowers; and where the damsel with the  dulcimer beside the running stream sings to him of Mount Abora and of  the old heroes of the elder days. If the Egyptologist or the  archaeologist could revive within him one-hundredth part of the elusive  romance, the delicate gaiety, the subtle humour, the intangible  tenderness, the unspeakable goodness, of much that is to be found in his  province, one would have to cry, like Coleridge--                                     \"Beware, beware!                      Weave a circle round him thrice,                      And close your eyes with holy dread,                      For he on honey-dew hath fed,                      And drunk the milk of Paradise.\"                                         PART II.                            STUDIES IN THE TREASURY.           \"And I could tell thee stories that would make thee laugh       at all thy trouble, and take thee to a land of which thou       hast never even dreamed. Where the trees have ever       blossoms, and are noisy with the humming of intoxicated       bees. Where by day the suns are never burning, and by       night the moonstones ooze with nectar in the rays of the       camphor-laden moon. Where the blue lakes are filled with       rows of silver swans, and where, on steps of lapis       lazuli, the peacocks dance in agitation at the murmur of       the thunder in the hills. Where the lightning flashes       without harming, to light the way to women stealing in       the darkness to meetings with their lovers, and the       rainbow hangs for ever like an opal on the dark blue       curtain of the cloud. Where, on the moonlit roofs of       crystal palaces, pairs of lovers laugh at the reflection       of each other's love-sick faces in goblets of red wine,       breathing, as they drink, air heavy with the fragrance of       the sandal, wafted on the breezes from the mountain of       the south. Where they play and pelt each other with       emeralds and rubies, fetched at the churning of the ocean       from the bottom of the sea. Where rivers, whose sands are       always golden, flow slowly past long lines of silent       cranes that hunt for silver fishes in the rushes on the       banks. Where men are true, and maidens love for ever, and       the lotus never fades.\"                                  F.W. BAIN: _A Heifer of the Dawn_.                                          CHAPTER IV.                      THE TEMPERAMENT OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.      A certain school geography book, now out of date, condenses its remarks  upon the character of our Gallic cousins into the following pregnant  sentence: \"The French are a gay and frivolous nation, fond of dancing  and red wine.\" The description would so nearly apply to the ancient  inhabitants of Egypt, that its adoption here as a text to this chapter  cannot be said to be extravagant. The unbiassed inquirer into the  affairs of ancient Egypt must discover ultimately, and perhaps to his  regret, that the dwellers on the Nile were a \"gay and frivolous people,\"  festive, light-hearted, and mirthful, \"fond of dancing and red wine,\"  and pledged to all that is brilliant in life. There are very many  people, naturally, who hold to those views which their forefathers held  before them, and picture the Egyptians as a sombre, gloomy people;  replete with thoughts of Death and of the more melancholy aspect of  religion; burdened with the menacing presence of a multitude of horrible  gods and demons, whose priests demanded the erection of vast temples for  their appeasement; having little joy of this life, and much uneasy  conjecture about the next; making entertainment in solemn gatherings and  ponderous feasts; and holding merriment in holy contempt. Of the five  startling classes into which the dictionary divides the human  temperament, namely, the bilious or choleric, the phlegmatic, the  sanguine, the melancholic, and the nervous, it is probable that the  first, the second, and the fourth would be those assigned to the ancient  Egyptians by these people. This view is so entirely false that one will  be forgiven if, in the attempt to dissolve it, the gaiety of the race is  thrust before the reader with too little extenuation. The sanguine, and  perhaps the nervous, are the classes of temperament under which the  Egyptians must be docketed. It cannot be denied that they were an  industrious and even a strenuous people, that they indulged in the most  serious thoughts, and attempted to study the most complex problems of  life, and that the ceremonial side of their religion occupied a large  part of their time. But there is abundant evidence to show that, like  their descendents of the present day, they were one of the least gloomy  people of the world, and that they took their duties in the most buoyant  manner, allowing as much sunshine to radiate through their minds as  shone from the cloudless Egyptian skies upon their dazzling country.    It is curiously interesting to notice how general is the present belief  in the solemnity of this ancient race's attitude towards existence,  and how little their real character is appreciated. Already the reader  will be protesting, perhaps, that the application of the geographer's  summary of French characteristics to the ancient Egyptians lessens in no  wise its ridiculousness, but rather increases it. Let the protest,  however, be held back for a while. Even if the Egyptians were not always  frivolous, they were always uncommonly gay, and any slight exaggeration  will be pardoned in view of the fact that old prejudices have to be  violently overturned, and the stigma of melancholy and ponderous  sobriety torn from the national name. It would be a matter of little  surprise to some good persons if the products of excavation in the Nile  Valley consisted largely of antique black kid gloves.      [Illustration: PL. VIII. Two Egyptian boys decked with flowers and a                           third holding a musical instrument. They are                           standing against the outside wall of the                           Dendereh Temple.]                             [_Photo by E. Bird._      Like many other nations the ancient Egyptians rendered mortuary service  to their ancestors, and solid tomb-chapels had to be constructed in  honour of the more important dead. Both for the purpose of preserving  the mummy intact, and also in order to keep the ceremonies going for as  long a period of time as possible, these chapels were constructed in a  most substantial manner, and many of them have withstood successfully  the siege of the years. The dwelling-houses, on the other hand, were  seldom delivered from father to son; but, as in modern Egypt, each  grandee built a palace for himself, designed to last for a lifetime  only, and hardly one of these mansions still exists even as a ruin.    Moreover the tombs were constructed in the dry desert or in the solid  hillside, whereas the dwelling-houses were situated on the damp earth,  where they had little chance of remaining undemolished. And so it is  that the main part of our knowledge of the Egyptians is derived from a  study of their tombs and mortuary temples. How false would be our  estimate of the character of a modern nation were we to glean our  information solely from its churchyard inscriptions! We should know  absolutely nothing of the frivolous side of the life of those whose bare  bones lie beneath the gloomy declaration of their Christian virtues. It  will be realised how sincere was the light-heartedness of the Egyptians  when it is remembered that almost everything in the following record of  their gaieties is derived from a study of the tombs, and of objects  found therein.    Light-heartedness is the key-note of the ancient philosophy of the  country, and in this assertion the reader will, in most cases, find  cause for surprise. The Greek travellers in Egypt, who returned to their  native land impressed with the wonderful mysticism of the Egyptians,  committed their amazement to paper, and so led off that feeling of awed  reverence which is felt for the philosophy of Pharaoh's subjects. But in  their case there was the presence of the priests and wise men eloquently  to baffle them into the state of respect, and there were a thousand  unwritten arguments, comments, articles of faith, and controverted  points of doctrine heard from the mouths of the believers, to surprise  them into a reverential attitude. But we of the present day have left to  us only the more outward and visible remains of the Egyptians. There are  only the fundamental doctrines to work on, the more penetrating notes of  the harmony to listen to. Thus the outline of the philosophy is able to  be studied without any complication, and we have no whirligig of  priestly talk to confuse it. Examined in this way, working only from  cold stones and dry papyri, we are confronted with the old \"Eat, drink,  and be merry,\" which is at once the happiest and most dangerous  philosophy conceived by man. It is to be noticed that this way of  looking at life"]]]
