Of course there is not  enough to go upon; and I could hardly venture to speak of it to Signor  Polani, or to accuse a woman, in whom he has perfect confidence, of  such frightful treachery on such vague grounds of suspicion. Still I do  suspect her; and I hope, when I go away from Venice, you will, as far  as you can, keep an eye upon her.\"    \"I do not know how to do that,\" Matteo said, laughing; \"but I will tell  my cousins that we don't like her, and advise them, in future, not on  any account to stay out after dusk, even if she gives them permission  to do so; and if I learn anything more to justify our suspicions, I  will tell my cousin what you and I think, though it won't be a pleasant  thing to do. However, Ruggiero is gone now, and I hope we sha'n't hear  anything more about him.\"    \"I hope not, Matteo; but I am sure he is not the man to give up the  plan he has once formed easily, any more than he is to forgive an  injury.    \"However, here we are at your steps. We will talk the other matter over  another time. Anyhow, I am glad I have told you what I thought, for it  has been worrying me. Now that I find you don't think my ideas about  her are altogether absurd, I will keep my eyes more open than ever in  future. I am convinced she is a bad one, and I only hope we may be able  to prove it.\"    \"You have made me very uncomfortable, Francisco,\" Matteo said as he  stepped ashore; \"but we will talk about it again tomorrow.\"    \"We shall meet at your cousin's in the evening. Before that time, we  had better both think over whether we ought to tell anyone our  suspicions, and we can hold a council in the gondola on the way back.\"    Francis did think the matter over that night. He felt that the fact  told him by Giulia, that the gouvernante had herself been the means of  their staying out later than usual on the evening of the attack, added  great weight to the vague suspicions he had previously entertained; and  he determined to let the matter rest no longer, but that the next day  he would speak to Signor Polani, even at the risk of offending him by  his suspicions of a person who had been, for some years, in his  confidence. Accordingly, he went in the morning to the palazzo, but  found that Signor Polani was absent, and would not be in until two or  three o'clock in the afternoon. He did not see the girls, who, he knew,  were going out to spend the day with some friends.    At three o'clock he returned, and found that Polani had just come in.    \"Why, Francisco,\" the merchant said when he entered, \"have you  forgotten that my daughters will be out all day?\"    \"No, signor, I have not forgotten that, but I wish to speak to you. I  dare say you will laugh at me, but I hope you will not think me  meddlesome, or impertinent, for touching upon a subject which concerns  you nearly.\"    \"I am sure you will not be meddlesome or impertinent, Francisco,\"  Signor Polani said reassuringly, for he saw that the lad was nervous  and anxious. \"Tell me what you have to say, and I can promise you  beforehand that, whether I agree with you or not in what you may have  to say, I shall be in no way vexed, for I shall know you have said it  with the best intentions.\"    \"What I have to say, sir, concerns the Signora Castaldi, your  daughters' gouvernante. I know, sir, that you repose implicit  confidence in her; and your judgment, formed after years of intimate  knowledge, is hardly likely to be shaken by what I have to tell you. I  spoke to Matteo about it, and, as he is somewhat of my opinion, I have  decided that it is, at least, my duty to tell you all the  circumstances, and you can then form your own conclusions.\"    Francis then related the facts known to him. First, that the assailants  of the gondola must have had accurate information as to the hour at  which they would come along; secondly, that it was at the gouvernante's  suggestion that the return had been delayed much later than usual;  lastly, that when the attack took place, the gouvernante did not raise  her voice to cry for assistance, and that she had, at the last moment,  so firmly seized their dresses, that it was only by tearing the girls  from her grasp that he had been enabled to get them into the boat.    \"There may be nothing in all this,\" he said when he had concluded. \"But  at least, sir, I thought that it was right you should know it; and you  will believe me, that it is only anxiety as to the safety of your  daughters that has led me to speak to you.\"    \"Of that I am quite sure,\" Signor Polani said cordially, \"and you were  perfectly right in speaking to me. I own, however, that I do not for a  moment think that the circumstances are more than mere coincidences.  Signora Castaldi has been with me for upwards of ten years. She has  instructed and trained my daughters entirely to my satisfaction. I do  not say that she is everything that one could wish, but, then, no one  is perfect, and I have every confidence in her fidelity and  trustworthiness. I own that the chain you have put together is a strong  one, and had she but lately entered my service, and were she a person  of whom I knew but little, I should attach great weight to the facts,  although taken in themselves they do not amount to much. Doubtless she  saw that my daughters were enjoying themselves in the society of my  friends, and in her kindness of heart erred, as she certainly did err,  in allowing them to stay longer than she should have done.    \"Then, as to her not crying out when attacked, women behave differently  in cases of danger. Some scream loudly, others are silent, as if  paralysed by fear. This would seem to have been her case. Doubtless she  instinctively grasped the girls for their protection, and in her fright  did not even perceive that a boat had come alongside, or know that you  were a friend trying to save them. That someone informed their  assailants of the whereabouts of my daughters, and the time they were  coming home, is clear; but they might have been seen going to the  house, and a swift gondola have been placed on the watch. Had this boat  started as soon as they took their seat in the gondola on their return,  and hastened, by the narrow canals, to the spot where their accomplices  were waiting, they could have warned them in ample time of the approach  of the gondola with my daughters.    \"I have, as you may believe, thought the matter deeply over, for it was  evident to me that the news of my daughters' coming must have reached  their assailants beforehand. I was most unwilling to suspect treachery  on the part of any of my household, and came to the conclusion that the  warning was given in the way I have suggested.    \"At the same time, Francisco, I thank you deeply for having mentioned  to me the suspicions you have formed, and although I think that you are  wholly mistaken, I certainly shall not neglect the warning, but shall  watch very closely the conduct of my daughters' gouvernante, and shall  take every precaution to put it out of her power to play me false, even  while I cannot, for a moment, believe she would be so base and  treacherous as to attempt to do so.\"    \"In that case, signor, I shall feel that my mission has not been  unsuccessful, however mistaken I may be, and I trust sincerely that I  am wholly wrong. I thank you much for the kind way in which you have  heard me express suspicions of a person in your confidence.\"    The gravity with which the merchant had heard Francis' story vanished  immediately he left the room, and a smile came over his face.    \"Boys are boys all the world over,\" he said to himself, \"and though my  young friend has almost the stature of a man, as well as the quickness  and courage of one, and has plenty of sense in other matters, he has at  once the prejudices and the romantic ideas of a boy. Had Signora  Castaldi been young and pretty, no idea that she was treacherous would  have ever entered his mind; but what young fellow yet ever liked a  gouvernante, who sits by and works at her tambour frame, with a  disapproving expression on her face, while he is laughing and talking  with a girl of his own age. I should have felt the same when I was a  boy. Still, to picture the poor signora as a traitoress, in the pay of  that villain Mocenigo, is too absurd. I had the greatest difficulty in  keeping my gravity when he was unfolding his story. But he is an  excellent lad, nevertheless. A true, honest, brave lad, with a little  of the bluffness that they say all his nation possess, but with a heart  of gold, unless I am greatly mistaken.\"    At seven o'clock, Francis was just getting into his gondola to go round  again to Signor Polani's, when another gondola came along the canal at  the top of its speed, and he recognized at once the badge of the  Giustiniani. It stopped suddenly as it came abreast of his own boat,  and Matteo, in a state of the highest excitement, jumped from his own  boat into that of Francis.    \"What is the matter, Matteo? What has happened?\"    \"I have terrible news, Francisco. My cousins have both disappeared.\"    \"Disappeared!\" Francis repeated in astonishment \"How have they  disappeared?\"    \"Their father has just been round to see mine. He is half mad with  grief and anger. You know they had gone to spend the day at the  Persanis?\"    \"Yes, yes,\" Francis exclaimed; \"but do go on, Matteo. Tell me all about  it, quickly.\"    \"Well, it seems that Polani, for some reason or other, thought he would  go and fetch them himself, and at five o'clock"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17567"],[0,"The Way of the Wild (#13)"],[1,"em, whichever he did do.    Now, books and men have said that friend hedgehog fears only two  things: gypsies and badgers--who eat him.  I should not be surprised at  anything the \"gyp\" did; nor, to this day, can we stake much on our  knowledge of the secret badger; but this badger, at any rate, seemed to  know nothing of books and men.  He was delving for roots when the  hedgehog cast up out of the night and jumped him to \"attention\" by his  loud sniffs--much like a big dog's, I said.  Thereafter, however, when  our prickly friend was represented as a ball only, and was as silent as  the grave, the badger took no further notice of him, beyond keeping one  eye--the weather eye--upon him, and treating him to a low growl, or  curse, truly, from time to time.    The hedgehog, however, once there, did not seem keen upon unrolling and  exposing himself till the badger had gone, which it did finally,  vanishing so suddenly and unexpectedly into the dark as almost to seem  to have been a ghost.  And after some minutes the hedgehog straightened  out, and ate his way--one can call it nothing else--to the hedge.  Here  he came upon a wounded mouse, complaining into the night in a little,  thin voice, because its back was broken, and it could not return to its  hole.  It was a harvest mouse, rejoicing in the enormous weight of 4.7  grains and a length of 57 mm., but with as much love of life and fear  of death as an elephant.  Heaven knows what had smitten it!  Perhaps it  was one of the very few who just escape the owl, or who foil that  scientific death, the weasel, at the last moment--but no matter.  The  result was the same--death, anyway.    The hedgehog saw its eyes shining like stars in a little jet of  moonlight, and I fear the hedgehog slew far less adroitly than the owl,  and not nearly so scientifically as the weasel; but he slew, none the  less, and he did that which he did.    From thence we find our hedgehog, still wandering devious, but with  always a direction, just as an ant has, heading his way down-ditch to a  farm, and all the way he ate--beetles mostly, but with slugs and worms  thrown in.    Now, those of the wild-folk who approach the farm, even by night, do so  with their life in their paws, and most of them know it.  Far, far  safer would it be to remain in wood or field-hedge, gorse-patch or  growing crop.  Yet they go, like the adventurers of old.    First of all, if he approached by ditch, before getting to the farm  proper, the hedgehog knew that he must pass the entrenchments of the  rat-folk, and that alone was enough to put off many, for the rat-folk  are no longer strictly wild, and, wild or tame, are hated with that  cordiality that only fear can impose.  I don't know that our hedgehog  was given to fearing anything very much.  He came of a brave race, and  one cursed, moreover, with a vile, quick temper, more than likely to  squash in its incipient stage any fear that might threaten to exist;  but he did most emphatically detest rats, except to eat them--a  compliment which the rats would have returned, if they had got a chance.    As a matter of fact, it is unlikely that Prickles--for such was the  name of our hedgehog--would have gone that risky way, traveled so  unhealthily far, left his more or less--mostly less--safe home wood at  all, had it not been that it is sometimes with hedgehogs as it is with  men--in the warm seasons--their fancy turns to thoughts of love.  Prickles's fancy had so turned, not lightly, for he was of an ancient  and antediluvian race, heavy in thought, but certainly to love.  And  love, I want you to realize, in the wild, or anywhere else, for the  matter of that, is the very devil.  \"Unite and multiply; there is no  other law or aim than love,\" one great savant despairingly assorts is  Nature's cry, and adds that she mutters to herself under her breath,  \"and exist afterwards if you can.  That is no concern of mine.\"    To be precise, Prickles, who did more business with his nose than all  the rest of his organs put together, was following a love-trail.  A  lady hedgehog, a flapper undoubtedly, and beautiful--all loves are  beautiful in imagination--had passed that way.  Why _that_ unhealthful  way, Heaven knew; but, allowing for the capriciousness of the sex, and  mad because in love, Prickles followed, slowly, deliberately, heavily,  as befitted one descended from one of the oldest races on earth.    The air was heavy with the scent of may and of honeysuckle, and his way  was a green-gold--silver where the moon cascaded down the hedge--and  blue-black bridal-path, arched with scented swords, strewn with pink  and rose and cream and white confetti of blossom.  But he only saw and  smelt one thing, and that, those who have known hedgehogs intimately  will agree, is not like unto the scent of any blossom.    Prickles was ruminating anciently upon these things, possibly, and  others, as he came down the trench--ditch, I mean--when the cry smote  him.  It smote everything--the filtered silence of the wonderful,  tranquil night, the pale moon half-light, the furtive rustling shadows  that stopped rustling, the wonderful breathing pulse of growing  vegetation.  And Prickles stopped as abruptly as if it had smitten him  on his nose, too.  He heard _that_, at any rate, whatever might have  been hinted about the value of his ears elsewhere.    There was no doubt about that cry, no possible shadow of doubt  whatever--it was a cry of extreme distress, a final, despairing S.O.S.,  flung out to the night in the frantic hope that one of the same species  would hear and help.    Several night-foraging wild-folk have S.O.S. signals of their own, but  none like this.  It was not a rabbit's cry, for bunny's signal is thin  and child-like; nor a hare's, for puss's last scream is like bunny's,  only more so; nor a stoat's, for that is instinct with anger as well as  pain; nor a cat's, for that thrills with hate; nor an owl's, for that  is ghostly; nor a fox's, for Reynard is dumb then; nor a rat's, for  that is gibbering and devilish; nor a mouse's, for that is weak and  helpless.  Then what?  And why had it touched up Prickles as if with a  live wire?  It was perhaps the rarest S.O.S. signal of all heard in the  wild, or one of the rarest, the peculiar, high, chattering, pig-like,  savage tremolo of a hedgehog booked for some extra deathly form of  death.  And Prickles--naturally he knew it.    It came from straightaway down the ditch; from ahead, where Prickles  had been heading for; from the farm, and Heaven know what it portended!  Perhaps, too, Prickles could tell a lady hedgehog's S.O.S. from that of  a gentleman of the same breed; or, perhaps--but how do I know?  He  certainly acted that way.    Prickles waited the one-fifth part of an instant, to listen and locate.  Then he got going, and provided one astonishment.  Till then he had  seemed slow as the times he had descended from--like a rhinoceros.  But, like a rhino, he proved that he could shift some when hustled.  He  did.  It looked like suddenly releasing a clockwork toy wound up to  breaking-point.  His short legs gave this impression, and his  next-to-no-neck, giving him a look of rigidity, assisted it.  He did  not run so much as rush, and his spines and bristles, coming low on  either side in an overhang, so to speak, like an armored car, made him  rustle and scuffle tremendously.  Three rabbits doing the same act, or  five cats, could scarce have made more row than he did.    It was not, however, so much the fact that Prickles had gone that was  so noticeable as the fact that he had _arrived_.  His arrival seemed to  follow his going as one slide follows another on a screen.  One would  never have believed such quickness of him; nor, as a matter of fact, do  I think he would have believed it of himself; but--well, love is a  mighty power, and makes folks do some strange things.    What he found was two ditch-banks, pock-marked with the untidy dug-outs  of the rat-people, smelling ratty, and looking worse, one original ray  of moonlight lighting the beaten ditch between.  In the moonlight one  young female hedgehog, who may have been pretty by hedgehog standards,  but was now pretty by none, and five rats, frankly beastly, very busy  indeed with that same hedgehog.  They must have caught that young lady  of the spikes \"napping\"--a rare thing.  Yet, allowing for the fact that  she was in love--with love and nothing else, so far--and careless, or  allowing that she may have mistaken the unclean ones momentarily, she  may have given them one brief half-instant.  And it doesn't do to give  a rat even the half of a half-instant.  If you do, he has got you, or  you haven't got him.    Apparently they had pretty well got her before she could quite roll up,  and in a half-rolled-up condition she was doing her best to meet the  jabs of five pairs of gnawing, cold-chisel, incisor, yellow-rats' teeth  at once.  To time, apparently, she had not been successful in the  attempt--you could see the dark stains of blood glisten in the  moonlight, and the end was certain, on the face of it.    Prickles, however, was a new factor that had got to short-circuit that  end, and Prickles didn't wait to meditate prehistorically _that_ time.  He came.  He came full tilt into the midst of the melee like--well,  like a clockwork toy still, that couldn't stop.  Only he did stop,  against the biggest rat of all, ducking his head, and jerking forward  his shoulder-muscles, and spines, with a sort of a thrust over his  head, and a noise like a pair of expiring bellows; and the prickles hit  home.    That rat removed about one foot in one bound in one-fortieth of a  second, and he let rip one squeal in the process that sent away every  other rat into the nearest available hole as if it had been fired there  from a spring.  Then the lady hedgehog took the Heaven-sent opportunity  to complete her rolling-up completely, and Prickles took his "]]]
