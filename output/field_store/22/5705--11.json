In such  a case the titration can be used (indirectly) to estimate the quantity  of such oxidising agent, by determining how much less of the  permanganate is used. For example, suppose that 1 gram of iron dissolved  in sulphuric acid requires 100 c.c. of standard permanganate to fully  oxidise it, but that the same amount of iron only requires 35.6 c.c. of  the same standard permanganate if it has been previously heated with 0.5  gram of black oxide of manganese. Here it is evident that 0.5 gram of  black oxide does the work of 64.4 c.c.[4] of the permanganate solution,  and that these quantities are equivalent; moreover, if 64.4 c.c.  correspond with 0.5 gram, then 100 c.c. correspond with 0.7764 which is  the standard. On theoretical grounds, and by a method of calculation  which will be explained further on (under the heading \"Calculations from  Formulæ\"), it can be found that if the standard for iron is 1 gram, that  for the black oxide will be 0.7764 gram.    The principles of these indirect titrations become clearer when  expressed in a condensed form. Thus, in the example selected, and using  the formulæ Fe = Iron, KMnO_{4} = permanganate of potash, and MnO_{2} =  oxide of manganese, we have:--    (1)                1 gram Fe = 100 c.c. KMnO_{4}    (2)                1 gram Fe = 35.6 c.c. KMnO_{4} + 0.5 gram MnO_{2}         .'. 100 c.c. KMnO_{4} = 35.6 c.c. KMnO_{4} + 0.5 gram MnO_{2}      (100-35.6) c.c. KMnO_{4} = 0.5 gram MnO_{2}            64.4 c.c. KMnO_{4} = 0.5 gram MnO_{2}    The iron does not enter into the calculation if the same quantity is  present in the two experiments.    An indirect titration thus requires three determinations, but if more  than one assay is to be carried on, two of these need not be repeated.  The standard is calculated in the usual way.    ~Colorimetric Assays.~--These are assays in which the colour imparted to  a solution by some compound of the metal to be determined is taken  advantage of; the depth of colour depending on the quantity of metal  present. They are generally used for the determination of such small  quantities as are too minute to be weighed. The method of working is as  follows:--A measured portion of the assay solution (generally 2/3, 1/2,  1/3, or 1/4 of the whole), coloured by the substance to be estimated, is  placed in a white glass cylinder standing on a sheet of white paper or  glazed porcelain. Into an exactly similar cylinder is placed the same  amount of re-agents, &c., as the portion of the assay solution contains,  and then water is added until the solutions are of nearly equal bulk.  Next, a standard solution of the metal being estimated is run in from a  burette, the mixture being stirred after each addition until the colour  approaches that of the assay. The bulk of the two solutions is equalised  by adding water. Then more standard solution is added until the tints  are very nearly alike. Next, the amount added is read off from the  burette, still more is poured in until the colour is slightly darker  than that of the assay, and the burette read off again. The mean of the  readings is taken, and gives the quantity of metal added. It equals the  quantity of metal in the portion of the assay. If this portion was  one-half of the whole, multiply by two; if one-third, multiply by three,  and so on. When the quantity of metal in very dilute solutions is to be  determined, it is sometimes necessary to concentrate the solutions by  boiling them down before applying the re-agent which produces the  coloured compound. Such concentration does not affect the calculations.    ~Gasometric Assays.~--Gasometric methods are not much used by assayers,  and, therefore, those students who wish to study them more fully than  the limits of this work will permit, are recommended to consult Winkler  and Lunge's text-book on the subject. The methods are without doubt  capable of a more extended application. In measuring liquids, ordinary  variations of temperature have but little effect, and variations of  atmospheric pressure have none at all, whereas with gases it is  different. Thus, 100 c.c. of an ordinary aqueous solution would, if  heated from 10° C. to 20° C., expand to about 100.15 c.c. 100 c.c. of a  gas similarly warmed would expand to about 103.5 c.c., and a fall of one  inch in the barometer would have a very similar effect. And in  measuring gases we have not only to take into account variations in  volume due to changes in temperature and atmospheric pressure, but also  that which is observed when a gas is measured wet and dry. Water gives  off vapour at all temperatures, but the amount of vapour is larger as  the temperature increases.    By ignoring these considerations, errors of 3 or 4 per cent. are easily  made; but, fortunately, the corrections are simple, and it is easy to  construct a piece of apparatus by means of which they may be reduced to  a simple calculation by the rule of three.    The volume of a gas is, in practice, usually reduced to that which it  would be at a temperature of 0° C., when the column of mercury in the  barometer is 760 mm. high. But, although convenient, this practice is  not always necessary. The only thing required is some way of checking  the variations in volume, and of calculating what the corrected volume  would be under certain fixed conditions.    Suppose that at the time a series of standardisings is being made, 100  c.c. of air were confined in a graduated tube over moist mercury. These  100 c.c. would vary in volume from day to day, but it would always be  true of them that they would measure 100 c.c. under the same conditions  as those under which the standardisings were made. If, then, in making  an actual assay, 35.4 c.c. of gas were obtained, and the air in the tube  measured 105 c.c., we should be justified in saying, that if the  conditions had been those of the standardising, the 105 c.c. would have  measured 100 c.c., and the 35.4 c.c. would have been 33.7; for 105:  100:: 35.4: 33.7. The rule for using such a piece of apparatus for  correcting volumes is:--_Multiply the c.c. of gas obtained by 100, and  divide by the number of c.c. of air in the apparatus._    If it is desired to calculate the volumes under standard conditions  (that is, the gas dry, at 0° C. and 760 mm. barometric pressure) the  calculations are easily performed, but the temperature and pressure must  be known.    _Correction for Moisture._--The \"vapour tension\" of water has been  accurately determined for various temperatures, and it may be looked  upon as counteracting the barometric pressure. For example, at 15° C.  the vapour tension equals 12.7 millimetres of mercury; if the barometer  stood at 750 mm., the correction for moisture would be made by  subtracting 12.7 from 750, and taking 737.3 mm. to be the true  barometric pressure.    The vapour tensions for temperatures from 0° C. to 20° C. are as  follows:--      -------+----------++-------+----------++-------+----------     Temp. | Tension. || Temp. | Tension. || Temp. | Tension.    -------+----------++-------+----------++-------+----------       0°  | 4.6 mm.  ||   7°  |  7.5 mm. ||  14°  | 11.9 mm.       1°  | 4.9 mm.  ||   8°  |  8.0 mm. ||  15°  | 12.7 mm.       2°  | 5.3 mm.  ||   9°  |  8.6 mm. ||  16°  | 13.5 mm.       3°  | 5.7 mm.  ||  10°  |  9.2 mm. ||  17°  | 14.4 mm.       4°  | 6.1 mm.  ||  11°  |  9.8 mm. ||  18°  | 15.3 mm.       5°  | 6.5 mm.  ||  12°  | 10.5 mm. ||  19°  | 16.3 mm.       6°  | 7.0 mm.  ||  13°  | 11.2 mm. ||  20°  | 17.4 mm.    -------+----------++-------+----------++-------+-----------    The _correction for pressure_ is:--Multiply the volume by the actual  pressure and divide by 760.    The _correction for temperature_:--Multiply the volume by 273 and divide  by the temperature (in degrees Centigrade) added to 273.    For all three corrections the following rules hold good. _To reduce to  0° C. and 760 mm. dry._                            Volume × 0.3592 × (Pressure-tension)    Corrected volume = --------------------------------------                                Temperature + 273    To find the volume, which a given volume under standard conditions would  assume, if those conditions are altered.                          Volume × 2.784 × (Temperature + 273)    Resulting volume =  ------------------------------------                                 Pressure - tension    As an example, we will suppose that it is desired to enclose in the  apparatus referred to on p. 45, a volume of air, which, when dry (at 0°  C. and 760 mm.), shall measure 100 c.c., whilst the actual temperature  is 15° C., and the pressure 750 mm.    The second formula is the one to be used, and we get 108.7 c.c.                           100 c.c.×2.784×288    Required volume =  ----------------------                             750-12.7                        80179.2                    = -------                       737.3                      = 108.7 c.c.

WEIGHING AND MEASURING.      ~Weighing.~--The system of weights and measures which we have adopted is  the French or metric system; in this the gram (15.43 grains) is the unit  of weight; the only other weight frequently referred to is the  milligram, which is 0.001, or 1/1000 gram. The unit of volume is the  cubic centimetre, which is approximately the volume of 1 gram of water,  and which thus bears to the gram the same relation as grain-measures  bear to grains.

In this way then faith  is said to be the \"substance of things to be hoped for,\" for the  reason that in us the first beginning of things to be hoped for is  brought about by the assent of faith, which contains virtually all  things to be hoped for. Because we hope to be made happy through  seeing the unveiled truth to which our faith cleaves, as was made  evident when we were speaking of happiness (I-II, Q. 3, A. 8; I-II,  Q. 4, A. 3).    The relationship of the act of faith to the object of the intellect,  considered as the object of faith, is indicated by the words,  \"evidence of things that appear not,\" where \"evidence\" is taken for  the result of evidence. For evidence induces the intellect to adhere  to a truth, wherefore the firm adhesion of the intellect to the  non-apparent truth of faith is called \"evidence\" here. Hence another  reading has \"conviction,\" because to wit, the intellect of the  believer is convinced by Divine authority, so as to assent to what it  sees not. Accordingly if anyone would reduce the foregoing words to  the form of a definition, he may say that \"faith is a habit of the  mind, whereby eternal life is begun in us, making the intellect  assent to what is non-apparent.\"    In this way faith is distinguished from all other things pertaining to  the intellect. For when we describe it as \"evidence,\" we distinguish  it from opinion, suspicion, and doubt, which do not make the intellect  adhere to anything firmly; when we go on to say, \"of things that  appear not,\" we distinguish it from science and understanding, the  object of which is something apparent; and when we say that it is \"the  substance of things to be hoped for,\" we distinguish the virtue of  faith from faith commonly so called, which has no reference to the  beatitude we hope for.    Whatever other definitions are given of faith, are explanations of  this one given by the Apostle. For when Augustine says (Tract. xl in  Joan.: QQ. Evang. ii, qu. 39) that \"faith is a virtue whereby we  believe what we do not see,\" and when Damascene says (De Fide Orth.  iv, 11) that \"faith is an assent without research,\" and when others  say that \"faith is that certainty of the mind about absent things  which surpasses opinion but falls short of science,\" these all amount  to the same as the Apostle's words: \"Evidence of things that appear  not\"; and when Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii) that \"faith is the solid  foundation of the believer, establishing him in the truth, and showing  forth the truth in him,\" comes to the same as \"substance of things to  be hoped for.\"    Reply Obj. 1: \"Substance\" here does not stand for the supreme genus  condivided with the other genera, but for that likeness to substance  which is found in each genus, inasmuch as the first thing in a genus  contains the others virtually and is said to be the substance thereof.    Reply Obj. 2: Since faith pertains to the intellect as commanded by  the will, it must needs be directed, as to its end, to the objects of  those virtues which perfect the will, among which is hope, as we  shall prove further on (Q. 18, A. 1). For this reason the definition  of faith includes the object of hope.    Reply Obj. 3: Love may be of the seen and of the unseen, of the  present and of the absent. Consequently a thing to be loved is not so  adapted to faith, as a thing to be hoped for, since hope is always of  the absent and the unseen.    Reply Obj. 4: \"Substance\" and \"evidence\" as included in the  definition of faith, do not denote various genera of faith, nor  different acts, but different relationships of one act to different  objects, as is clear from what has been said.    Reply Obj. 5: Evidence taken from the proper principles of a thing,  make[s] it apparent, whereas evidence taken from Divine authority  does not make a thing apparent in itself, and such is the evidence  referred to in the definition of faith.  _______________________    SECOND ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 4, Art. 2]    Whether Faith Resides in the Intellect?    Objection 1: It would seem that faith does not reside in the  intellect. For Augustine says (De Praedest. Sanct. v) that \"faith  resides in the believer's will.\" Now the will is a power distinct  from the intellect. Therefore faith does not reside in the intellect.    Obj. 2: Further, the assent of faith to believe anything, proceeds  from the will obeying God. Therefore it seems that faith owes all its  praise to obedience. Now obedience is in the will. Therefore faith is  in the will, and not in the intellect.    Obj. 3: Further, the intellect is either speculative or practical.  Now faith is not in the speculative intellect, since this is not  concerned with things to be sought or avoided, as stated in _De  Anima_ iii, 9, so that it is not a principle of operation, whereas  \"faith . . . worketh by charity\" (Gal. 5:6). Likewise, neither is  it in the practical intellect, the object of which is some true,  contingent thing, that can be made or done. For the object of faith  is the Eternal Truth, as was shown above (Q. 1, A. 1). Therefore  faith does not reside in the intellect.    _On the contrary,_ Faith is succeeded by the heavenly vision,  according to 1 Cor. 13:12: \"We see now through a glass in a dark  manner; but then face to face.\" Now vision is in the intellect.  Therefore faith is likewise.    _I answer that,_ Since faith is a virtue, its act must needs be  perfect. Now, for the perfection of an act proceeding from two active  principles, each of these principles must be perfect: for it is not  possible for a thing to be sawn well, unless the sawyer possess the  art, and the saw be well fitted for sawing. Now, in a power of the  soul, which is related to opposite objects, a disposition to act well  is a habit, as stated above (I-II, Q. 49, A. 4, ad 1, 2, 3).  Wherefore an act that proceeds from two such powers must be perfected  by a habit residing in each of them. Again, it has been stated above  (Q. 2, AA. 1, 2) that to believe is an act of the intellect inasmuch  as the will moves it to assent. And this act proceeds from the will  and the intellect, both of which have a natural aptitude to be  perfected in this way. Consequently, if the act of faith is to be  perfect, there needs to be a habit in the will as well as in the  intellect: even as there needs to be the habit of prudence in the  reason, besides the habit of temperance in the concupiscible faculty,  in order that the act of that faculty be perfect. Now, to believe is  immediately an act of the intellect, because the object of that act  is \"the true,\" which pertains properly to the intellect. Consequently  faith, which is the proper principle of that act, must needs reside  in the intellect.    Reply Obj. 1: Augustine takes faith for the act of faith, which is  described as depending on the believer's will, in so far as his  intellect assents to matters of faith at the command of the will.    Reply Obj. 2: Not only does the will need to be ready to obey but  also the intellect needs to be well disposed to follow the command of  the will, even as the concupiscible faculty needs to be well disposed  in order to follow the command of reason; hence there needs to be a  habit of virtue not only in the commanding will but also in the  assenting intellect.    Reply Obj. 3: Faith resides in the speculative intellect, as  evidenced by its object. But since this object, which is the First  Truth, is the end of all our desires and actions, as Augustine proves  (De Trin. i, 8), it follows that faith worketh by charity just as  \"the speculative intellect becomes practical by extension\" (De Anima  iii, 10).  _______________________    THIRD ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 4, Art. 3]    Whether Charity Is the Form of Faith?    Objection 1: It would seem that charity is not the form of faith.  For each thing derives its species from its form. When therefore two  things are opposite members of a division, one cannot be the form of  the other. Now faith and charity are stated to be opposite members of  a division, as different species of virtue (1 Cor. 13:13). Therefore  charity is not the form of faith.    Obj. 2: Further, a form and the thing of which it is the form are in  one subject, since together they form one simply. Now faith is in the  intellect, while charity is in the will. Therefore charity is not the  form of faith.    Obj. 3: Further, the form of a thing is a principle thereof. Now  obedience, rather than charity, seems to be the principle of  believing, on the part of the will, according to Rom. 1:5: \"For  obedience to the faith in all nations.\" Therefore obedience rather  than charity, is the form of faith.    _On the contrary,_ Each thing works through its form. Now faith works  through charity. Therefore the love of charity is the form of faith.    _I answer that,_ As appears from what has been said above (I-II, Q.  1, A. 3; I-II, Q. 18, A. 6), voluntary acts take their species from  their end which is the will's object. Now that which gives a thing  its species, is after the manner of a form in natural things.  Wherefore the form of any voluntary act is, in a manner, the end to  which that act is directed, both because it takes its species  therefrom, and because the mode of an action should correspond  proportionately to the end. Now it is evident from what has been said  (A. 1), that the act of faith is directed to the object of the will,  i.e. the good, as"]]]
