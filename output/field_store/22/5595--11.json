[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],[0,"The English Gipsies and Their Language (#13)"],[1,"the  present day to any Gipsies whom I have met.  Again, it should be  remembered that the pronunciation of Rommany differs widely with  individuals; thus the word which is given as _cumbo_, a hill, by Bryant,  I have heard very distinctly pronounced _choomure_.    I believe that to Mr Borrow is due the discovery that the word JOCKEY is  of Gipsy origin, and derived from _chuckni_, which means a whip.  For  nothing is more clearly established than that the jockey-whip was the  original term in which this word first made its appearance on the turf,  and that the _chuckni_ was a peculiar form of whip, very long and heavy,  first used by the Gipsies.  \"Jockeyism,\" says Mr Borrow, \"properly means  _the management of a whip_, and the word jockey is neither more nor less  than the term, slightly modified, by which they designate the formidable  whips which they usually carry, and which are at present in general use  among horse-traffickers, under the title of jockey-whips.\"  In Hungary  and Germany the word occurs as _tschuckini_ or _chookni_, and _tschupni_.    Many of my readers are doubtless familiar with the word to TOOL as  applied to dexterously managing the reins and driving horses.  'To tool  the horses down the road,' is indeed rather a fine word of its class,  being as much used in certain clubs as in stables, and often denotes  stylish and gentlemanly driving.  And the term is without the slightest  modification, either of pronunciation or meaning, directly and simply  Gipsy, and is used by Gipsies in the same way.  It has, however, in  Rommany, as a primitive meaning--to hold, or to take.  Thus I have heard  of a feeble old fellow that \"he could not tool himself togetherus\"--for  which last word, by the way, _kettenus_ might have been more correctly  substituted.    COVE is not an elegant, though a very old, word, but it is well known,  and I have no doubt as to its having come from the Gipsy.  In Rommany,  all the world over, _cova_ means \"a thing,\" but it is almost indefinite  in its applicability.  \"It is,\" says Pott, \"a general helper on all  occasions; is used as substantive and adjective, and has a far wider  scope than the Latin _res_.\"  Thus _covo_ may mean \"that man;\" _covi_,  \"that woman;\" and _covo_ or _cuvvo_, as it very often does in English,  \"that, there.\"  It sometimes appears in the word _acovat_, or _this_.  There is no expression more frequent in a Gipsy's mouth, and it is  precisely the one which would be probably overheard by \"Gorgios\" and  applied to persons.  I believe that it first made its appearance in  English slang as _covey_, and was then pronounced _cuvvy_, being  subsequently abbreviated into cove.    Quite a little family of words has come into English from the Rommany,  _Hocben_, _huckaben_, _hokkeny_, or _hooker_, all meaning a lie, or to  lie, deception and _humbug_.  Mr Borrow shows us that _hocus_, to  \"bewitch\" liquor with an opiate, and _hoax_, are probably Rommany from  this root, and I have no doubt that the expression, \"Yes, with a _hook_,\"  meaning \"it is false,\" comes from the same.  The well-known \"Hookey\" who  corresponds so closely with his untruthful and disreputable pal \"Walker,\"  is decidedly of the streets--gipsy.  In German Gipsy we find _chochavav_  and _hochewawa_, and in Roumanian Gipsy _kokao_--a lie.  Hanky-panky and  Hocus-pocus are each one half almost pure Hindustani. {81}    A SHINDY approaches so nearly in sound to the Gipsy word _chingaree_,  which means precisely the same thing, that the suggestion is at least  worth consideration.  And it also greatly resembles _chindi_, which may  be translated as \"cutting up,\" and also quarrel.  \"To cut up shindies\"  was the first form in which this extraordinary word reached the public.  In the original Gipsy tongue the word to quarrel is _chinger-av_, meaning  also (Pott, _Zigeuner_, p. 209) to cut, hew, and fight, while to cut is  _chinav_.  \"Cutting up\" is, if the reader reflects, a very unmeaning word  as applied to outrageous or noisy pranks; but in Gipsy, whether English,  German, or Oriental, it is perfectly sensible and logical, involving the  idea of quarrelling, separating, dividing, cutting, and stabbing.  What,  indeed, could be more absurd than the expression \"cutting up shines,\"  unless we attribute to _shine_ its legitimate Gipsy meaning of _a piece  cut off_, and its cognate meaning, a noise?    I can see but little reason for saying that a man _cut away_ or that he  _shinned_ it, for run away, unless we have recourse to Gipsy, though I  only offer this as a mere suggestion.    \"Applico\" to shindy we have the word ROW, meaning nearly the same thing  and as nearly Gipsy in every respect as can be.  It is in Gipsy at the  present day in England, correctly, _rov_, or _roven_--to cry--but _v_ and  _w_ are so frequently transposed that we may consider them as the same  letter.  _Raw_ or _me rauaw_, \"I howl\" or \"cry,\" is German Gipsy.  _Rowan_  is given by Pott as equivalent to the Latin _ululatus_, which constituted  a very respectable _row_ as regards mere noise.  \"Rowdy\" comes from \"row\"  and both are very good Gipsy in their origin.  In Hindustani _Rao mut_ is  \"don't cry!\"    CHIVVY is a common English vulgar word, meaning to goad, drive, vex,  hunt, or throw as it were here and there.  It is purely Gipsy, and seems  to have more than one root.  _Chiv_, _chib_, or _chipe_, in Rommany, mean  a tongue, inferring scolding, and _chiv_ anything sharp-pointed, as for  instance a dagger, or goad or knife.  But the old Gipsy word _chiv-av_  among its numerous meanings has exactly that of casting, throwing,  pitching, and driving.  To _chiv_ in English Gipsy means as much and more  than to _fix_ in America, in fact, it is applied to almost any kind of  action.    It may be remarked in this connection, that in German or continental  Gipsy, which represents the English in a great measure as it once was,  and which is far more perfect as to grammar, we find different words,  which in English have become blended into one.  Thus, _chib_ or _chiv_, a  tongue, and _tschiwawa_ (or _chiv_-ava), to lay, place, lean, sow, sink,  set upright, move, harness, cover up, are united in England into _chiv_,  which embraces the whole.  \"_Chiv it apre_\" may be applied to throwing  anything, to covering it up, to lifting it, to setting it, to pushing it,  to circulating, and in fact to a very great number of similar verbs.    There is, I think, no rational connection between the BUNG of a barrel  and an eye which has been closed by a blow.  One might as well get the  simile from a knot in a tree or a cork in a flask.  But when we reflect  on the constant mingling of Gipsies with prizefighters, it is almost  evident that the word BONGO may have been the origin of it.  A _bongo  yakko_ or _yak_, means a distorted, crooked, or, in fact, a bunged eye.  It also means lame, crooked, or sinister, and by a very singular figure  of speech, _Bongo Tem_ or the Crooked Land is the name for hell. {83}    SHAVERS, as a quaint nick-name for children, is possibly inexplicable,  unless we resort to Gipsy, where we find it used as directly as possible.  _Chavo_ is the Rommany word for child all the world over, and the English  term _chavies_, in Scottish Gipsy _shavies_, or shavers, leaves us but  little room for doubt.  I am not aware to what extent the term \"little  shavers\" is applied to children in England, but in America it is as  common as any cant word can be.    I do not know the origin of the French word CLICHY, as applied to the  noted prison of that name, but it is perhaps not undeserving the comment  that in Continental Gipsy it means a key and a bolt.    I have been struck with the fact that CALIBAN, the monster in \"The  Tempest,\" by Shakespeare, has an appellation which literally signifies  blackness in Gipsy.  In fact, this very word, or Cauliban, is given in  one of the Gipsy vocabularies for \"black.\"  Kaulopen or Kauloben would,  however, be more correct.    \"A regular RUM 'un\" was the form in which the application of the word  \"rum\" to strange, difficult, or distinguished, was first introduced to  the British public.  This, I honestly believe (as Mr Borrow indicates),  came from _Rum_ or _Rom_, a Gipsy.  It is a peculiar word, and all of its  peculiarities might well be assumed by the sporting Gipsy, who is always,  in his way, a character, gifted with an indescribable self-confidence, as  are all \"horsey\" men characters, \"sports\" and boxers, which enables them  to keep to perfection the German eleventh commandment, \"Thou shall not  let thyself be _bluffed_!\"--_i.e_., abashed.    PAL is a common cant word for brother or friend, and it is purely Gipsy,  having come directly from that language, without the slightest change.  On  the Continent it is _prala_, or _pral_.  In England it sometimes takes  the form \"_pel_.\"    TRASH is derived by Mr Wedgwood (Dictionary of English Etymology, 1872)  from the old word _trousse_, signifying the clipping of trees.  But in  old Gipsy or in the German Gipsy of the present day, as in the Turkish  Rommany, it means so directly \"fear, mental weakness and worthlessness,\"  that it may possibly have had a Rommany origin.  Terror in Gipsy is  _trash_, while thirst is _trush_, and both are to be found in the  Hindustani.  _Tras_, which means _thirst_ and _alarm_ or _terror_.    It should be observed that in no instance can these Gipsy words have been  borrowed from English slang.  They are all to be found in German Gipsy,  which is in its turn identical with the Rommany language of India--of the  Nats, Bhazeghurs, Doms, Multanee or Banjoree, as I find the primitive  wandering Gipsies termed by different writers.    I am aware that the word CAD was applied to the conductor of an omnibus,  or to a non-student at Universities, before it became a synonym for  vulgar fellow, yet I believe that it was abbreviated from cadger, and  that this is simply the Gipsy word Gorgio, which often means a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16360"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 561, October 2, 1886 (#13)"],[1,"         |    Molec.

JONES, M.P.S.           *       *       *       *       *          THE CATASTROPHE AT CHANCELADE.      The Chancelade quarries near Perigneux, which caved in Oct. 22, 1885,  under circumstances that are still fresh in the minds of all, have  gained a celebrity that renders it unnecessary for us to revert to the  details of the catastrophe. It will suffice to recall the fact that  after the accident a private committee was formed for the purpose of  making an attempt to save the five victims who had been surprised in  the drifts, and who happened to be in the bottom levels.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--PHOTOGRAPHIC EXPLORING APPARATUS.]    The Lippmann establishment at once offered to make a boring by means  of which it would be possible to communicate with the galleries in  which the men were imprisoned, but, despite the most active efforts,  success was found impossible. In order to satisfy public opinion, the  committee resolved to bore a well 12 inches in diameter to a depth of  23 feet, that should permit of reaching the gallery; but this did not  render the latter accessible. How was it to be seen what had occurred,  how was it to be made certain that the men were dead, and that all  hope of rescue must be abandoned? To Mr. Langlois, a Parisian  photographer, was confided an order to construct a special apparatus  which might be let down to the bottom of the well by a cord, and  which, being capable of operating from a distance, should furnish the  required information through sensitized plates. As may be seen, this  operation presented peculiar difficulties, although Mr. Langlois was  enabled to overcome these with much skill.    The photographic apparatus that the ingenious operator constructed was  contained in a metallic case that could be let down into the bore  hole. The upper and lower parts of the contrivance were provided with  incandescent lamps, that could be lighted or extinguished from a  distance, by means of conductors. The photographic apparatus, properly  so called, formed of an objective and camera with its sensitized  plate, was inclosed in a cylinder 31/2 inches in diameter. By means of a  cord drawn at the mouth of the well, the apparatus could be made to  issue from its vertical sheath, and to pivot around its axis so as  take views in different directions (Fig. 1).    The entire affair was suspended by twelve-foot iron rods, connected  with each other end for end.    In using the apparatus, the operating was done in a shanty, which  served as a dark room. The device was let down into the bore well  until it touched bottom. At this moment a cord was pulled so as to  raise the camera, and then a few moments were allowed to elapse in  order that the apparatus might become immovable. As the objective was  all the time in the dark, it had neither cap nor shutter, but was  unmasked from the beginning of the operation.    In order to form an impression on the plate, it was only necessary to  give light; this being easily done by passing an electric current by  means of a commutator, so as to light the incandescent lamps. At the  end of the exposure, the lamps were extinguished and the entire  apparatus was immersed in darkness. The mean time of exposure was from  four to five minutes. The apparatus was then hauled up, and the  negative developed.    The experiments could be renewed as often as necessary, and the  apparatus be pointed in all directions by turning it a certain number  of degrees by means of a lever attached to the upper rod. In this way  were obtained various views of the inaccessible gallery in different  planes.    [Illustration: FIGS. 2 AND 3.--REPRODUCTION OF PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN IN  THE INACCESSIBLE GALLERIES.]    We reproduce herewith two of Mr. Langlois' most interesting  photographs. One of these shows the head of the corpse of a young  miner whose face stands out in relief against the side of the gallery  (Fig. 2) the other shows a wheel and a lot of debris heaped up  pell-mell (Fig. 3).    The series of proofs obtained from small negatives, two inches square,  gave the completest sort of information in regard to the aspect of the  subterranean gallery.    The exact place where the boring had been done and the entire and  broken pillars were recognized, as was also the presence of two  corpses, thus showing that it was indeed here that it would have been  necessary to act in order to render aid to the unfortunates.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--FAULT THAT CAUSED THE ACCIDENT.]    In Fig. 4 is shown the appearance of the great fault that caused the  accident at Chancelade. It seems to us that this method of  photographing inaccessible subterranean galleries ought to receive  numerous applications in the future.--_La Nature._           *       *       *       *       *          SOMZEE'S NEW GAS-BURNERS.
