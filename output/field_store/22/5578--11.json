A double paddle was fashioned from a board 1 inch thick, 6  inches wide and 6 feet long. The blades were shaved down to a thickness  of 3/8 of an inch at the edges.    It will be observed that we used no iron in the construction of this  boat. Uncle Ed has warned us not to, because iron rusts out so easily  and is apt to damage both the canvas and the wood with which it is in  contact.    [Illustration: Fig. 120. The Double Paddle.]    A canoe is rather a tipsy thing to sail in, as we soon learned, and it  was lucky that we could all swim, else our vacation might have ended  very tragically; for the very first time Bill and I tried the boat an  unexpected gust of wind struck us and over we went. We were very poor  sailors at first, but it didn't take us long to catch on.      LEE BOARDS    One thing that bothered us greatly in sailing was the keel of our canoe.  It was forever getting twisted, particularly when we tried to make a  landing. There were only a few places along the island where the water  was deep enough to permit our coming right up to shore without striking  the keel. The fastening was not very strong, and every once and awhile  it would be wrenched loose. The matter was made the subject of a special  letter to Uncle Ed, and in due time his answer was received. As usual,  he offered a first-class solution of the difficulty. \"Don't use a keel,\"  he wrote; \"lee boards are much better.\" Then he went on to explain what  was meant by lee boards: \"The leeward side of a boat is the opposite of  the windward side; that is, that side of the boat which is sheltered  from the wind. Lee boards, then, are boards which are hung over the lee  side of a boat to prevent it from drifting to leeward, and they serve to  take the place of a keel or centerboard.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 121. A Lee Board.]    [Illustration: Fig. 122. Section of the Canoe, Showing Lee Board.]    [Illustration: Fig. 123. The Lee Boards in Use on Canoe.]    Following Uncle Ed's direction we fastened a strip of wood across the  canoe about six feet from the bow, nailing it firmly to the gunwales.  This provided a support to which the lee boards were secured. The lee  boards were paddle-shaped affairs of the form and dimensions shown in  Fig. 121. Each paddle near the top was hinged to the end of a board  three inches wide and a foot long. The paddle was held at right angles  to the board by means of a hook. Each board was fastened with door  hinges to a baseboard which extended the width of the boat and was  attached to the crosspiece of the canoe by means of a couple of bolts.  The bolt heads were countersunk, so that the hinged boards could lie  flat over them. To the top of each lee board two ropes were attached,  one passing forward around a pulley and thence back to a cleat within  easy reach of the occupant of the canoe, and the other passing directly  back to this cleat. By pulling the former rope the lee board was lifted  out of the water, while the latter rope was used to swing the board into  working position. When tacking to port (left), the board on the left  side of the canoe was lowered and the other was raised, as shown in Fig.  123, and when tacking to the starboard (right) the board on the right  side was lowered, while the left one was raised.    [Illustration: The Indian Canoe Fitted with Lanteen Sail and Lee Boards.]      THE INDIAN PADDLING CANOE.    [Illustration: Fig. 124. Center Form.]    [Illustration: Fig. 125. Intermediate Form.]    [Illustration: Fig. 126. The Stem Piece.]    [Illustration: Fig. 127. Skeleton Frame of Canoe.]    [Illustration: Fig. 128. Section at Center of Canoe.]    Our sailing canoe proved such a good one that we decided to build a  second. This was to be much lighter, for paddling only, and of the true  Indian shape, with wide, bulging sides and raised stem and stern. The  dimension of the forms used are given in Figs. 124 and 125. These forms,  it will be observed, were notched to receive the keelson and gunwales.  The keelson was formed of 1-inch spruce 3 inches wide and 10 feet long.  The stem and stern, which were both of the same shape, were cut from a  12-inch board to the form shown in Fig. 126, and were firmly secured to  the keelson. This made the boat 12 feet long. The forms were then set in  place on the keelson, one at the center and the others three feet each  side. The gunwales were formed of 3/4-inch by 2-1/2-inch spruce, and the  twelve rib bands used were of the size used in our first boat. As none  of these forms was to remain in the boat, nails were driven very lightly  into them, with heads projecting so that they could easily be withdrawn  when it was time to remove the forms. The cross ribs were passed under  the keelson inside of the rib bands and outside of the gunwales, as  shown in Fig. 128. After they were set in place and firmly secured with  copper tacks, a band was nailed to the keelson to form the keel. To  produce the raised stem and stern, four wedge-shaped pieces were nailed  to the tops of the gunwales, as indicated in Fig. 129. The forms were  then removed and were replaced with cross sticks braced between the  gunwales. The center cross stick was provided with two corner pieces, as  shown in Fig. 130, adapted to fit under the gunwales and against the rib  bands. The canvas was then applied in the manner described before, but  was tacked to the upper edge of the gunwale instead of the outer side,  and the tacks were covered by a half-round molding which extended around  the entire boat. After the lacing was cut the edge of the canvas was  secured to the under edges of the gunwales. The canoe was then completed  by fastening on a 1-inch square keel and treating the boat with two  coats of paint. The paddle was a duplicate of the one described in  connection with the sailing canoe.    [Illustration: Fig. 129. Wedge Pieces at the Ends.]    I remember that we eventually equipped our paddling canoe with a sail  and a pair of lee boards, though no record of this fact appears in the  chronicles of the society.    [Illustration: Fig. 130. The Cross Braces.]          CHAPTER XI.    HOUSE BUILDING.      One afternoon Fred, who had waded over to Lumberville after some  provisions, came splashing back holding aloft a large square envelope.  It was from Uncle Ed and contained a photograph of a group of Wichita  Indians building a large grass lodge. In a brief explanatory letter  Uncle Ed suggested that we build a similar hut on our Island.      THE GRASS HUT.    [Illustration: Fig. 131. Making the Frame of the Straw Hut.]    [Illustration: Fig. 132. Doorway of the Hut.]    The grass lodge appealed to us as very picturesque, and we set to work  immediately on its construction. We made our hut much smaller, however,  only 12 feet in diameter, and 8 or 9 feet high. First we procured two  dozen light poles between 10 and 12 feet long. These we set up about 18  inches apart in a circle like a stockade, the sticks being buried in the  ground to a depth of 12 inches. At one side a space of 3 feet was  allowed for a doorway. Inside the stockade we erected a working platform  of planks supported on barrels, and standing on this we took two  opposite poles, bent them inward and lashed their upper ends together.  Then a second pair of opposite poles were similarly bent inward and  tied, and so we proceeded until the entire stockade had been converted  into a dome-shaped cage. Around these poles we laid lighter sticks, or  bands, tying them at the points of intersection. At the doorway two  posts were set firmly in the ground, projecting upward to a height of 4  feet. A lintel nailed across the top of the posts completed the door  frame. Sticks were nailed to the lintel and to the side posts, extending  to the main frame of the hut, to which they were tied. We were now ready  to thatch our hut. Reddy and Dutchy went over to Lumberville for several  bales of straw. We tied the straw in bunches and applied it to the  frame, copying, as best we could, the process illustrated in the  photograph.    But for its location the hut would have proved a very serviceable  habitation. In order to have a good, dry dwelling without laying down a  board flooring, we had selected for its site the sandy shore at Point  Lookout. This part of the island was not sheltered with trees, and the  hot sun beat down on our hut so strongly that we found the quarters very  uncomfortable indeed. It was this fact that led to the construction of a  tree hut--a building that would be perfectly dry and yet shaded and  cool. Bill had read of such houses in the Philippines and felt confident  that we could build one. We couldn't decide at first where to locate our  hut until Dutchy moved that we build it in the gnarled oak tree  overlooking the \"Goblins' Dancing Platform.\" Immediately the motion was  seconded and unanimously carried.      THE GOBLINS' DANCING PLATFORM.    Just above the town of Lumberville there was a cliff which rose sheer  200 feet above the level of the river. So perpendicular was the cliff  that a stone dropped from the overhanging ledge at the top would fall  straight down to the railroad track below without touching a twig in its  course. Back of this broad ledge there was a very peculiar formation. A  column of stone rose abruptly 40 feet higher and was topped with a large  slab about 12 feet in diameter. This was known all over that region as  the Goblins' Dancing Platform. The only possible way of gaining the  summit of the column was by climbing a scraggly oak tree which grew on  the high ground back of the pillar, crawling out on an overhanging limb,  and then dropping down to the platform below. It was in this oak that we  decided to build our house. It was a very inaccessible spot, and to  reach it we had to make a wide detour around the back of the hill, and  through the fields of a cranky farmer, who more than once threatened to  fill"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15839"],[0,"The Rebel of the School (#13)"],[1,"the  tea-table was laid. Kathleen gave Maria sixpence for the washing of an  extra cloth, and the well-spread table looked quite fresh and  wonderfully like a school-feast.    When Mrs. Tennant returned (she came in looking very hot and tired), it  was to see the room tidy, Kathleen seated in her own special chair  cobbling the boys' socks as hard as she could, and an appetizing tea on  the table.    \"What does this mean?\" said Mrs. Tennant.    \"It means,\" said Kathleen, jumping up, \"that you are to plant yourself  just here, and you are not to stir. Oh, I know you are _dead_ tired. I  will take off your shoes, poor dear; I have brought your slippers down  on purpose, and you are to have your tea at this little table. Now what  will you have? Hot sausages?--They are done to a turn, aren't they,  Maria?\"    \"That they are, miss.\"    \"A nice hot sausage on toast, and a lovely cup of tea with cream in it.\"    \"But--but,\" said Mrs. Tennant, \"what will Alice say?\"    \"Maria and I don't care twopence what Alice says. This is my tea, and  Maria fetched it. Now then, dear tired one, eat and rest.\"    Mrs. Tennant looked at Kathleen with loving eyes.    \"Did you buy these things?\" she said.    \"That she did, ma'am,\" cried Maria. \"I never did see a more thoughtful  young lady.\"    \"My dear child,\" said Mrs. Tennant, \"you are too good.\"    Kathleen laughed.    \"If there is one thing I am, it is not that,\" she said. \"I am not a bit  good. I am as wild and naughty and----Oh, but don't let us talk about  me. I am so hungry. You know I didn't much like your dinner to-day. I am  not fond of those watery stews. Of course, I can eat anything, but I  don't specially like them; so if you don't mind I will have a sausage,  too, and a plateful of shrimps afterwards, and some sardines. And isn't  this water-cress nice? The leaves are not quite so brown as I should  like. Oh, we did have such lovely water-cress in the stream at home!  Mrs. Tennant, you must come back with me to Carrigrohane some day, and  then you will have a real rest.\"    Mrs. Tennant, feeling very much like a naughty child herself, enjoyed  her tea. She and Kathleen laughed over the shrimps, exclaimed at the fun  of eating the water-cress, enjoyed the sausages, and each drank four  cups of tea. It was when the meal had come to an end that Kathleen said  calmly:    \"Three or four, or perhaps five, ladies called while Maria was out.\"    \"Who were they, dear?\"    \"I don't know. They left messages, and I have forgotten them. One lady  was dressed in what I should call a very loud style. She was quite old.  Her face was all over wrinkles. She was stout, and she wore a short  jacket and a big--very big--picture-hat.\"    \"You don't mean,\" said Mrs. Tennant, \"that Mrs. Dalzell has called? She  is one of my most important friends. She promised to help me with regard  to David's future. What did she say--can't you remember?\"    \"I am ever so sorry, but I can't. I kept staring at her hat all the  time. I don't remember anything about her except that she was old and  had wrinkles and a big picture-hat--the sort of hat that Ruth Craven  would look pretty in.\"    Mrs. Tennant began to find the remembrance of her delightful tea a  little depressing, for, question Kathleen as she might, she did not  remember anything about the ladies except a few fugitive descriptions.  As far as Mrs. Tennant could make out, people who were of the greatest  importance to her had left messages, and yet none of the messages could  be attended to.    \"I can't even imagine who the other ladies can be,\" she said. \"But as to  Mrs. Dalzell, she must not be neglected; I must go out and see her at  once.\"    \"Then you will be more tired than ever, and I have not done a scrap of  good.\"    \"You meant very kindly, my dear child, and have given me a delicious and  strengthening tea. Only don't do it again, darling, for it is my place  to give you tea, not yours to give it to me.\"          CHAPTER VII.    THE QUEEN AND HER SECRET SOCIETY.      Mrs. Tennant had not been out more than a minute or two before David and  Ben came in. Kathleen saw them from the window; she tapped on the window  with her knuckles, nodded to them, kissed her hand, and looked radiant  with delight. Some boys at the opposite side of the street saw her and  burst out laughing. David's face grew red.    \"I wish the little Irish girl wouldn't make us figures of fun,\" said  Ben, speaking in an annoyed tone.    The next instant David had opened the door with his latchkey, and  Kathleen was waiting for them in the hall.    \"Sausages,\" she said, bringing out the word with great gusto, \"and  shrimps, and water-cress, and sardines, besides bread-and-butter galore,  and nice hot tea. Maria is making fresh tea now in the kitchen. Come  along in--do; you must be ravenous.\"    The boys stared at her. Ben forgot his anger; he was schoolboy enough to  thoroughly enjoy the delicious meal which Kathleen had prepared.    When it came to an end David jumped up impatiently.    \"Where are you going, Dave?\" asked Kathleen in an interested voice. She  wanted him to help her. She had hoped that he and she would go away to  the old loft together, and talk as they had done the night before. But  David was firm.    \"I am going to the church,\" he said, \"to practice on the organ. I only  get the chance three times a week, and I must not neglect it.\"    \"David hopes to be no end of a swell some day,\" remarked Ben. \"He thinks  he can make the instrument speak.\"    \"And so can I,\" said Kathleen. \"May I come with you, Dave?\"    \"Some day,\" he replied, looking at her kindly, \"but not to-day. I'll be  back as soon as I can.\"    David did not notice her disappointed face; he went out immediately,  without even going upstairs first. Ben and Kathleen were now alone.  Kathleen looked at him attentively.    \"I wonder--\" she said slowly.    \"What are you staring at me for?\" said Ben.    \"I have been wondering what sort you are. I have got cousins at home,  and they do anything in the world I like. I wonder if you would.\"    Ben had been very cross with Kathleen when she had knocked to him and  David from the dining-room window, but he was not cross now. He was only  thirteen, and up to the present no pretty girl had ever taken the  slightest notice of him. He was a plain, sandy-haired boy, with a  freckled face, a wide mouth, and good-humored blue eyes.    \"You make me laugh whenever I look at you,\" was Kathleen's next candid  remark.    \"I didn't know that I was so comical,\" was his answer.    \"Perhaps you don't like it.\"    \"I can't say I do.\"    \"Well, this is the Palace of Home Truths,\" said Kathleen, laughing. \"I  asked your darling, saintly sister just now which was the most  wicked--to tell a polite lie, or a frightfully rude home truth. She said  that a polite lie was an awful sin, so in this house I must cleave to  the home truths. I could tell you, you know, that you have quite a  fascinating smile, and a very taking voice, and a delightful and  polished manner; but I prefer to tell you that you are comical, which  means that I feel inclined to burst out laughing whenever I look at  you.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Ben, who could be very sulky when he liked. \"Then I  will take my objectionable presence out of your sight. I have got my  lessons to do.\"    Kathleen raised her brows and gave a slow smile. Ben got as far as the  door.    \"Benny,\" she said then in a most seductive whisper.    He turned.    \"I am so glad you are in.\"    \"I should not have thought so.\"    \"But I am. It is awfully lonely for a girl like me, who has got dozens  of cousins at home, and uncles and aunts and all the rest of the goodly  fry, to be stranded. I like David. I am quite smitten with David; and I  like you, too. You can be a _great_ friend of mine.\"    \"Oh, I don't mind,\" said Ben.    He thought it would be very good fun to tell the other fellows about  the charming Irish girl who liked him so much.    \"I wonder if you'd help me, Ben.\"    \"What can I do?\" asked Ben.    \"Sit down, and let's be cozy. I will sit in the tired one's chair, and  you can sit on that little stool at my feet. Now isn't that nice?\"    \"Who do you mean by the tired one?\"    \"Your mother, silly boy, of course.\"    \"It is a very ridiculous name to call her.\"    \"It belongs to the Palace of Home Truths. Your mother is tired, and  you--you lazy omadhauns--\"    \"Well, go on,\" said Ben. \"I see by your manner that you want me to do  something. I suppose it's something a little bit--a little bit not quite  good.\"    \"It is perfectly good. I'll love you ever so much if you will do it.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"I am going out this evening. I may not be in until late. If the others  are in bed, will you come and unlock the door for me when I throw gravel  up at your window? You must tell me which is your window.\"    \"I sleep in the north attic. It doesn't look out on to the street; and I  can't--I can't possibly do it.\"    \"You can come down and wait for me in the hall.\"    \"How can I?\"    \"When the tired one goes to bed, you can come down. She goes to bed at  ten, I know, and I shall not be in until about half-past ten. I don't  want Dave to know--well, because I don't. I don't want Alice to know,  because I dislike Alice very much.\"    \"Really, Kathleen, you ought not to speak like that.\"    \"Well, I do, and I can't help myself. Will you do what I want? Here, do  you think you'd like this in your possession?\"    As Kathleen spoke she held out a golden sovereign in the palm of her  little hand.    \"I don't want to be bribed.\"    \"It isn't bribery really; it is paying you for giving me a great  convenience. I must go out on important business. I want to help those  who are down-trodden and distressed. Will you do what I want, Ben--will  you, dear Ben? You know I like you so much. Will you--will you?\"    Of course, Ben fought against Kathleen's rather wicked suggestion; of  course in the end he yielded. When he finally got up to"]]]
