Wherefore, just as matter cannot receive a form, unless it be  duly disposed thereto, so nothing gains an end, except it be duly  ordained thereto. And therefore none can obtain Happiness, without  rectitude of the will. Concomitantly, because as stated above (Q. 3,  A. 8), final Happiness consists in the vision of the Divine Essence,  Which is the very essence of goodness. So that the will of him who  sees the Essence of God, of necessity, loves, whatever he loves, in  subordination to God; just as the will of him who sees not God's  Essence, of necessity, loves whatever he loves, under the common  notion of good which he knows. And this is precisely what makes the  will right. Wherefore it is evident that Happiness cannot be without  a right will.    [Reply Obj. 1: Augustine is speaking of knowledge of truth that is  not the essence of goodness itself.]    Reply Obj. 2: Every act of the will is preceded by an act of the  intellect: but a certain act of the will precedes a certain act of  the intellect. For the will tends to the final act of the intellect  which is happiness. And consequently right inclination of the will is  required antecedently for happiness, just as the arrow must take a  right course in order to strike the target.    Reply Obj. 3: Not everything that is ordained to the end, ceases with  the getting of the end: but only that which involves imperfection,  such as movement. Hence the instruments of movement are no longer  necessary when the end has been gained: but the due order to the end  is necessary.  ________________________    FIFTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 4, Art. 5]    Whether the Body Is Necessary for Man's Happiness?    Objection 1: It would seem that the body is necessary for Happiness.  For the perfection of virtue and grace presupposes the perfection of  nature. But Happiness is the perfection of virtue and grace. Now the  soul, without the body, has not the perfection of nature; since it is  naturally a part of human nature, and every part is imperfect while  separated from its whole. Therefore the soul cannot be happy without  the body.    Obj. 2: Further, Happiness is a perfect operation, as stated above  (Q. 3, AA. 2, 5). But perfect operation follows perfect being: since  nothing operates except in so far as it is an actual being. Since,  therefore, the soul has not perfect being, while it is separated from  the body, just as neither has a part, while separate from its whole;  it seems that the soul cannot be happy without the body.    Obj. 3: Further, Happiness is the perfection of man. But the soul,  without the body, is not man. Therefore Happiness cannot be in the  soul separated from the body.    Obj. 4: Further, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vii, 13) \"the  operation of bliss,\" in which operation happiness consists, is \"not  hindered.\" But the operation of the separate soul is hindered;  because, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35), the soul \"has a  natural desire to rule the body, the result of which is that it is  held back, so to speak, from tending with all its might to the  heavenward journey,\" i.e. to the vision of the Divine Essence.  Therefore the soul cannot be happy without the body.    Obj. 5: Further, Happiness is the sufficient good and lulls desire.  But this cannot be said of the separated soul; for it yet desires to  be united to the body, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35).  Therefore the soul is not happy while separated from the body.    Obj. 6: Further, in Happiness man is equal to the angels. But the  soul without the body is not equal to the angels, as Augustine says  (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35). Therefore it is not happy.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Apoc. 14:13): \"Happy [Douay:  'blessed'] are the dead who die in the Lord.\"    _I answer that,_ Happiness is twofold; the one is imperfect and is had  in this life; the other is perfect, consisting in the vision of God.  Now it is evident that the body is necessary for the happiness of this  life. For the happiness of this life consists in an operation of the  intellect, either speculative or practical. And the operation of the  intellect in this life cannot be without a phantasm, which is only in  a bodily organ, as was shown in the First Part (Q. 84, AA. 6, 7).  Consequently that happiness which can be had in this life, depends, in  a way, on the body. But as to perfect Happiness, which consists in the  vision of God, some have maintained that it is not possible to the  soul separated from the body; and have said that the souls of saints,  when separated from their bodies, do not attain to that Happiness  until the Day of Judgment, when they will receive their bodies back  again. And this is shown to be false, both by authority and by reason.  By authority, since the Apostle says (2 Cor. 5:6): \"While we are in  the body, we are absent from the Lord\"; and he points out the reason  of this absence, saying: \"For we walk by faith and not by sight.\" Now  from this it is clear that so long as we walk by faith and not by  sight, bereft of the vision of the Divine Essence, we are not present  to the Lord. But the souls of the saints, separated from their bodies,  are in God's presence; wherefore the text continues: \"But we are  confident and have a good will to be absent . . . from the body, and  to be present with the Lord.\" Whence it is evident that the souls of  the saints, separated from their bodies, \"walk by sight,\" seeing the  Essence of God, wherein is true Happiness.    Again this is made clear by reason. For the intellect needs not the  body, for its operation, save on account of the phantasms, wherein it  looks on the intelligible truth, as stated in the First Part (Q. 84,  A. 7). Now it is evident that the Divine Essence cannot be seen by  means of phantasms, as stated in the First Part (Q. 12, A. 3).  Wherefore, since man's perfect Happiness consists in the vision of  the Divine Essence, it does not depend on the body. Consequently,  without the body the soul can be happy.    We must, however, notice that something may belong to a thing's  perfection in two ways. First, as constituting the essence thereof;  thus the soul is necessary for man's perfection. Secondly, as  necessary for its well-being: thus, beauty of body and keenness of  perfection belong to man's perfection. Wherefore though the body does  not belong in the first way to the perfection of human Happiness, yet  it does in the second way. For since operation depends on a thing's  nature, the more perfect is the soul in its nature, the more  perfectly it has its proper operation, wherein its happiness  consists. Hence, Augustine, after inquiring (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35)  \"whether that perfect Happiness can be ascribed to the souls of the  dead separated from their bodies,\" answers \"that they cannot see the  Unchangeable Substance, as the blessed angels see It; either for some  other more hidden reason, or because they have a natural desire to  rule the body.\"    Reply Obj. 1: Happiness is the perfection of the soul on the part of  the intellect, in respect of which the soul transcends the organs of  the body; but not according as the soul is the natural form of the  body. Wherefore the soul retains that natural perfection in respect  of which happiness is due to it, though it does not retain that  natural perfection in respect of which it is the form of the body.    Reply Obj. 2: The relation of the soul to being is not the same as  that of other parts: for the being of the whole is not that of any  individual part: wherefore, either the part ceases altogether to be,  when the whole is destroyed, just as the parts of an animal, when the  animal is destroyed; or, if they remain, they have another actual  being, just as a part of a line has another being from that of the  whole line. But the human soul retains the being of the composite  after the destruction of the body: and this because the being of the  form is the same as that of its matter, and this is the being of the  composite. Now the soul subsists in its own being, as stated in the  First Part (Q. 75, A. 2). It follows, therefore, that after being  separated from the body it has perfect being and that consequently it  can have a perfect operation; although it has not the perfect  specific nature.    Reply Obj. 3: Happiness belongs to man in respect of his intellect:  and, therefore, since the intellect remains, it can have Happiness.  Thus the teeth of an Ethiopian, in respect of which he is said to be  white, can retain their whiteness, even after extraction.    Reply Obj. 4: One thing is hindered by another in two ways. First, by  way of opposition; thus cold hinders the action of heat: and such a  hindrance to operation is repugnant to Happiness. Secondly, by way of  some kind of defect, because, to wit, that which is hindered has not  all that is necessary to make it perfect in every way: and such a  hindrance to operation is not incompatible with Happiness, but  prevents it from being perfect in every way. And thus it is that  separation from the body is said to hold the soul back from tending  with all its might to the vision of the Divine Essence. For the soul  desires to enjoy God in such a way that the enjoyment also may  overflow into the body, as far as possible. And therefore, as long as  it enjoys God, without the fellowship of the body, its appetite is at  rest in that which it has, in such a way, that it would still wish  the body to attain to its share.    Reply Obj. 5: The desire of the separated soul is entirely at rest,  as regards the thing desired; since, to wit, it has that which  suffices its appetite. But it is not wholly at rest, as regards the  desirer, since it does not possess that good in every way that it  would wish to possess it. Consequently, after the body has been  resumed, Happiness increases not in intensity, but in extent.

Boiling is done in pieces of bamboo about 4 inches in diameter  and about 15 or 18 inches long. They fill these with water, put the  food into them, and then place or hold the bamboo stems in a slanting  position in the flames. This method is specially used for cooking sweet  potatoes, but it is their only method of boiling anything. Water, which  they keep stored and carry in bamboo receptacles and hollow pumpkins,  is boiled in bamboo stems in the same way. The bamboo storage vessels  are generally from 2 to 5 feet long, the intersecting nodes, other  than that at one end, having been removed. The pumpkins (Plate 52,  Figs. 2 and 3) are similar to those used by the Roro coast people and  in Mekeo, except that the usual form, instead of being rather short  and broad with a narrow opening, is longer and narrower, some of them  being, say, 3 feet long, and often very curved and crooked in shape.    Their only eating utensils are wooden dishes and small pieces of wood,  or sometimes of cassowary or kangaroo bone, which are used as forks,  and pieces of split bamboo, which are used for cutting meat; but these  latter are used for other purposes, and rather come within the list  of ordinary implements, and will be there described. They also use  prepared pig-bones as forks; but these again are largely used for  other purposes, and will be described under the same heading.    The dishes (Plate 52, Fig. 1) are made out of the trunk of a tree  called _ongome_. The usual length of a dish, without its handles,  is between 1 and 2 feet; its width varies from 9 inches to 1 foot,  and its depth from 3 to 6 inches. It is rudely carved out of the  tree-trunk, [50] the work being done with stone adzes--unless they  happen to possess European axes--and it generally has a handle at one  or both ends. It is not decorated with carving in any way. The common  form of handle is merely a simple knob about 3 inches long and 1 1/2  inches wide. But it is sometimes less simple, and I have a dish one  of the handles of which is divided into two projecting pieces about  7 1/2 inches long and joined to each other at the end. The handle  is always carved out of the same piece of wood as is the dish;  never made separately and afterwards attached. The wooden forks  are simply bits cut from trees and sharpened at one end, and they  are without prongs. Their use is only temporary, and they are not  permanently stored as household utensils. The cassowary and kangaroo  bone implements (Plate 25, Fig. 3) are also merely roughly pointed  unpronged pieces of bone, and otherwise without special form. When  eating _en famille_ they do not always use these pointed wooden and  bone sticks, but very commonly take the food out of the dish with  their hands only; but if the family had guests with them they would  probably use the sticks more, and their hands less. The men and women  often eat together, sitting round the dish and helping themselves  out of it, though, if there are too many to do this conveniently,  pieces will be handed out to some of them.      Various Implements.    Besides the cooking and eating implements above described and  other things, such as weapons of war and of hunting and fishing,  and implements for manufacture, agriculture and music, which will be  dealt with under their own headings, there are a few miscellaneous  things which may be conveniently described here.    Bamboo knives (Plate 51, Fig. 5). These are simple strips made out of  a special mountain form of bamboo, and are generally 8 to 10 inches  long and about 1 inch wide. One edge is left straight for its whole  length, and the other is cut away near the end, very much as we cut  away one side of a quill pen, so as to produce a sharp point. The  side edge which is used for cutting is the one which is not cut away  at the end; and when it gets blunt it is renewed by simply peeling  off a length of fibre, thus producing a new edge, bevelled inwards  towards the concave side of the implement, and making a hard and  very sharp fresh cutting edge. The point can of course be sharpened  at any time in the obvious way.    Pig-bone implements (Plate 51, Fig. 2). These are the implements  which are often used as forks, but they have straight edges also  with which they are used as scraping knives, and they are utilised  for many other purposes. The implement, which is, I think, similar  to what is commonly found in Mekeo and on the coast, is made out of  the leg-bone of a pig, and is generally from 5 to 8 inches long. One  side of the bone is ground away, so as to make the implement flattish  in section, one side (the outside unground part of the bone) being  somewhat convex, and the other (where the bone has been ground away)  being rather concave. Some of the joint end of the bone is left to  serve as a handle; and from this the bone is made to narrow down to  a blunt, rather flattish and rounded point, somewhat like that of  a pointed paper-cutter. The side edge is used for scraping, and the  point for sticking into things.    Smoking pipes are in the ordinary well-known form of Mekeo and the  coast, being made of sections of bamboo stem in which the natural  intersecting node near the mouthpiece end is bored and the node at the  other end is left closed, and between these two nodes, near to the  closed one, is a flute-like hole, in which is placed the cigarette  of tobacco wrapped up in a leaf. They are, however, generally not  ornamented; or, if they are so, it is merely in a simple geometric  pattern of straight lines. I obtained one pipe (Plate 51, Fig. 1) of  an unusual type, being much smaller than is usual. A special feature  of this pipe is its decoration, which includes groups of concentric  circles. This is the only example of a curved line which I ever met  with among the Mafulu villages, and it is probable that it had not  been made there.    Boring drills (Plate 51, Fig. 4) are also similar to those of Mekeo  and the coast, except that there the fly-wheel is, I think, usually  a horizontal circular disc, through the centre of which the upright  shaft of the implement passes, whereas in the Mafulu boring instrument  the fly-wheel, through which the shaft passes, is a rudely cut flat  horizontal piece of wood about 9 or 10 inches long, 2 inches broad,  and half an inch or less thick, and also that in Mafulu the native  point, made out of a pointed fragment of the stone used for making  club-heads, adze blades and cloth-beaters, is not generally replaced  by a European iron point, as is so commonly the case in Mekeo and  near the coast. These drills are used for boring dogs' teeth and  shells and other similar hard-substanced things, but are useless  for boring articles of wood or other soft substances, in which the  roughly formed point would stick. [51]    Fire-making. This is a question of process, rather than of implement,  but may be dealt with here. To produce fire, the Mafulu native  takes two pieces of very dry and inflammable wood, one larger than  the other, and some dry bark cloth fluff. He then holds the smaller  piece of wood and the fluff together, and rubs them on the larger  piece of wood. After four or five minutes the fluff catches fire,  without bursting into actual flame, upon which the native continues the  rubbing process, blowing gently upon the fluff, until the two pieces  of wood begin to smoulder, and can then be blown into a sufficient  flame for lighting a fire.    Carrying bags. These are all made of network. I shall say something  about the mode of netting and colouring them hereafter, and will here  only deal with the bags and their use. They are of various sizes,    (1) There are the large bags used by women for carrying heavy objects,  such as firewood, vegetables and fruit, which they bring back to  the village on their return in the afternoon from the gardens and  bush. These bags are carried in the usual way, the band over the  opening of the bag being passed across the front of the head above the  forehead, and the bag hanging over the back behind. They are curved  in shape, the ends of the bag being at both its top and bottom edges  higher than are the centres of those edges, so that, when a bag is  laid out flat, its top line is a concave one and its bottom line is a  convex one. The network at the two ends of the top line is continued  into the loop band by means of which the bag is carried. The usual  dimensions of one of these bags, as it lies flat and unstretched  on a table (the measurements being made along the curved lines)  are as follows--top line about 2 feet, bottom line about 3 feet,  and side lines about 18 inches. But when filled with vegetables,  firewood, etc., they expand considerably, especially those made of  \"Mafulu network,\" of which I shall speak hereafter. These bags are  uncoloured. (2) There are similar, but somewhat smaller, bags, in  which the women carry lighter things, and which in particular they  use for carrying their babies. They frequently carry this bag and  the larger one together; and you will often see a woman with a big  bag heavily laden with vegetables or firewood or both, and another  smaller bag (perhaps also slung behind over the top of the big one,  or hanging from her head at her side, or over her breast), which  contains her baby, apparently rolled up into a ball. These bags also  are uncoloured. (3) There are other bags, similar perhaps in size to  No. 2, used for visiting and at feasts, dances and similar occasions,  and also sometimes used for carrying babies. The top line of one of  these is generally about 2 feet long, the bottom line a trifle longer,  and the side lines about 1 foot. These are coloured in decorative  patterns. (4) There are small bags of various sizes carried by men  slung over their shoulders or arms, and used to hold their betel-nut,  pepper and tobacco and various little"]]]
