Oh why should you ever have thought of me so?\"    Dropping his valise, his whole manner changing, he turned to her with  passionate vehemence. \"Because I couldn't help it! Even as a boy I gave up  my whole heart to you, and I cannot call it back. Oh, Elsie, why did I  ever see you?\" and he seized both her hands in a grasp that almost forced  a cry of pain from her white, quivering lips. \"Life is worthless without  you. I'd rather die knowing that you loved me than live to see you in the  possession of another.\"    \"Harold, Harold, a sister's love I can, I do give you; and can you not be  content with that?\"    \"A sister's love!\" he repeated scornfully. \"Offer a cup with a drop of  water in it, to a man perishing, dying with thirst. Yes, I'm going away, I  care not whither; all places are alike to him who has lost all interest in  life.\"    He threw her hands from him almost with violence, half turned away, then  suddenly catching her in his arms, held her close to his heart, kissing  passionately, forehead, cheek, and lips. \"Oh, Elsie, Elsie, light of my  eyes, core of my heart, why did we ever meet to part like this? I don't  blame you. I have been a fool. Good-bye, darling.\" And releasing her, he  was gone ere she could recover breath to speak. It had all been so sudden  she had had no power, perhaps no will, to resist, so sore was the tender,  loving heart for him.    He was barely in time to hail the boat as it passed, and at the instant he  was about to step aboard, Mr. Dinsmore rode up, and springing from the  saddle, throwing the reins to his servant, cried out in astonishment,  \"Harold! you are not leaving us? Come, come, what has happened to hurry  you away? Must you go?\"    \"Yes, I must,\" he answered with half-averted face. \"Don't call me a  scoundrel for making such a return for your hospitality. I couldn't help  it. Good-bye. Try to forget that I've been here at all; for Rose's sake,  you know.\"    He sprang into the boat; it pushed off, and was presently lost to sight  among the trees shading the bayou on either hand.    Mr. Dinsmore stood for a moment as if spellbound; then turned and walked  thoughtfully towards the house. \"What did it all mean?\" he asked himself;  \"of what unkind return of his or Elsie's hospitality could the lad have  been guilty? Elsie! ha! can it be possible?\" and quickened his pace,  glancing from side to side in search of her as he hurried on.    Entering the hall, the sound of a half-smothered sob guided him to a  little parlor or reception-room seldom used. Softly he opened the door.  She was there half-reclining upon a sofa, her face buried in the cushions.  In a moment he had her in his arms, the weary, aching head on his breast,  while he tenderly wiped away the fast-falling tears.    \"My poor darling, my poor little pet, don't take it so to heart. It is  nothing; he will probably get over it before he is a month older.\"    \"Papa, is it my fault? did I give him undue encouragement? am I a  coquette?\" she sobbed.    \"Far from it! did he dare to call you that?\"    \"No, no, oh, no; he said he did not blame me; it was all his own folly.\"    \"Ah! I think the better of him for that; though 'twas no more than just.\"    \"I thought he knew of my engagement.\"    \"So did I. And the absurdity of the thing! Such a mixture of relationships  as it would have been! I should never have entertained the thought for a  moment. And he ought to have spoken to me first, and spared you all this.  No, you needn't fret; he deserves all he suffers, for what he has  inflicted upon you, my precious one.\"    \"I hardly think that, papa; he was very generous to take all the blame to  himself; but oh, you have eased my heart of half its load. What should I  ever do without you, my own dear, dear father!\"    The pleasure of our friends, during the rest of their stay at Viamede, was  somewhat dampened by this unfortunate episode, though Elsie, for her  father's sake, did her best to rally from its effect on her spirits, and  to be cheerful and gay as before.    Long, bright, loving letters from home, and Ion coming the next day, were  a great help. Then the next day brought a chaplain, who seemed in all  respects so well suited to his place as to entirely relieve her mind in  regard to the future welfare of her people. He entered into all her plans  for them, and promised to carry them out to the best of his ability.    So it was with a light heart, though not without some lingering regrets  for the sad ones and the loveliness left behind, that she and her father  set out on their homeward way.    Mr. Dinsmore's man John, Aunt Chloe, and Uncle Joe, went with them; and it  was a continual feast for master and mistress to see the happiness of the  poor old couple, especially when their grandchild Dinah, their only living  descendant so far as they could learn, was added to the party; Elsie  purchasing her, according to promise, as they passed through New Orleans  on their return trip.    Dinah was very grateful to find herself installed as assistant to her  grandmother, who, Elsie said, must begin to take life more easily now in  her old age. Yet that Aunt Chloe found it hard to do, for she was very  jealous of having any hands but her own busied about the person of her  idolized young mistress.    A glad welcome awaited them at home, where they arrived in due season for  Adelaide's wedding.    Sophie and Harry Carrington had returned from their wedding trip, and were  making their home with his parents, at Ashlands; Richard, Fred, and May  Allison, came with their brother Edward; but Harold, who was to meet them  at Roselands, was not there. He had engaged to act as second groomsman,  Richard being first, and there was much wondering over his absence; many  regrets were expressed, and some anxiety was felt.    But Elsie and her father kept their own counsel, and breathed no word of  the episode at Viamede, which would have explained all.    Harold's coming was still hoped for by the others until the last moment,  when Fred took his place, and the ceremony passed off as satisfactorily as  if there had been no failure on the part of any expected, to participate  in it.    It took place in the drawing-room at Roselands, in presence of a crowd of  aristocratic guests, and was considered a very grand affair. A round of  parties followed for the next two weeks, and then the happy pair set sail  for Europe.          CHAPTER NINTH.        \"My plots fall short, like darts which rash hands throw       With an ill aim, and have too far to go.\"                                         --SIR ROBERT HOWARD.      \"I'm so glad it's all over at last!\"    \"What, my little friend?\" and Mr. Travilla looked fondly into the sweet  face so bright and happy, where the beauties of rare intellect and moral  worth were as conspicuous as the lesser ones of exquisite contour and  coloring.    \"The wedding and all the accompanying round of dissipation. Now I hope we  can settle down to quiet home pleasures for the rest of the winter.\"    \"So do I, and that I shall see twice as much of you as I have of late. You  can have no idea how I missed you while you were absent. And I am more  than half envious of our bride and groom. Shall our trip be to Europe,  Elsie?\"    \"Are we to take a trip?\" she asked with an arch smile.    \"That will be as you wish, dearest, of course.\"    \"I don't wish it now, nor do you, I know; but we shall have time enough to  settle all such questions.\"    \"Plenty; I only wish we had not so much. Yet I don't mean to grumble; the  months will soon slip away and bring the time when I may claim my prize.\"    They were riding towards the Oaks; the sun had just set, and the moon was  still below the horizon.    Elsie suddenly reined in her horse, Mr. Travilla instantly doing likewise,  and turned a pale, agitated face upon him. \"Did you hear that?\" she asked  low and tremulously.    \"What, dear child? I heard nothing but the sound of our horses' hoofs, the  sighing of the wind in the tree-tops, and our own voices.\"    \"I heard another; a muttered oath and the words, 'You shall never win her.  I'll see to that.' The tones were not loud but deep, and the wind seemed  to carry the sounds directly to my ear,\" she whispered, laying a trembling  little hand on his arm, and glancing nervously from side to side.    \"A trick of the imagination, I think, dearest; but from whence did the  sounds seem to come?\"    \"From yonder thicket of evergreens and--I knew the voice for that of your  deadly foe, the man from whom you and papa rescued me in Landsdale.\"    \"My child, he is expiating his crime in a Pennsylvania penitentiary.\"    \"But may he not have escaped, or have been pardoned out? Don't, oh don't,  I entreat you!\" she cried, as he turned his horse's head in the direction  of the thicket. \"You will be killed.\"    \"I am armed, and a dead shot,\" he answered, taking a revolver from his  breast pocket.    \"But he is in ambush, and can shoot you down before you can see to aim at  him.\"    \"You are right, if there is really an enemy concealed there,\" he  answered, returning the revolver to its former resting-place; \"but I feel  confident that it was either a trick of the imagination with you, or that  some one is playing a practical joke upon us. So set your tears at rest,  dear child, and let us hasten on our way.\"    Elsie yielded to his better judgment, trying to believe it nothing worse  than a practical joke; but had much ado to quiet her agitated nerves and  recover her composure before a brisk canter brought them to the Oaks, and  she must meet her father's keen eye.    They found Arthur in the drawing-room, chatting with Rose. He rose with a  bland, \"Good-evening,\" and gallantly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14875"],[0,"Elsie's children (#13)"],[1,"good doctor!\" cried the child, clasping her  hands in delight.    The next day brought Sally, but they scarcely recognized her, she had  grown so plump and rosy, and there was so glad a light in the eyes that  looked curiously at them through glasses clear as crystal.    Mrs. Travilla took her by both hands and kissed her.    \"Welcome, Sally; I am glad to see you, but should scarcely have known  you, had we met in a crowd;--you are looking so well and happy.\"    \"And so I am, my dear kind friend,\" the girl answered with emotion; \"and I  can see! see to read fine print that is all a blur to me without these  glasses; and all the pain is gone, the fear, the distress of body and  mind. Oh, the Lord has been good, good to me! and the doctor so kind and  interested! I shall be grateful to him and to you as long as I live!\"    \"Oh, did he make you those glasses? what did he do to you?\" asked the  eager, curious children. \"Tell us all about it, please.\"    But mamma said, \"No, she is too tired now; she must go to her room and lie  down and rest till tea-time.\"    Little Elsie showed her the way, saw that nothing was wanting that could  contribute to her comfort, then left her to her repose.    It was needed after all the excitement and the hot dusty ride in the cars;  but she came down from it quite fresh, and as ready to pour out the whole  story of the experiences of the past two weeks as the children could  desire.    When tea was over, they clustered round her on the cool breezy veranda  overlooking the restless murmuring sea, and by her invitation, questioned  her to their heart's content.    \"Is he a nice kind old man, like our doctor at Ion?\" began little Harold.    \"Quite as nice and kind I should think, but not very old.\"    \"Did he hurt you very much?\" asked Elsie, who had great sympathy for  suffering, whether mental or physical.    \"Oh, no, not at all! He said directly that the eyes were not diseased; the  trouble was malformation and could be remedied by suitable glasses; and  oh, how glad I was to hear it!\"    \"I thought mamma read from your letter that he put medicine in your eyes.\"    \"Yes, belladonna, but that was only to make them sick, so that he could  examine them thoroughly, and measure them for the glasses.\"    Turning to Mrs. Travilla, \"He is very kind and pleasant to every one; so  far as I could see making no difference between rich and poor, but deeply  interested in each case in turn; always giving his undivided attention to  the one he has in hand at the moment; putting his whole heart and mind  into the work.\"    \"Which is doubtless one great reason why he is so successful,\" remarked  Mrs. Travilla, adding, \"Remember that, my children; half-hearted work  accomplishes little for this world or the next.\"    \"Weren't you afraid the first time you went?\" asked timid little Elsie.    \"My heart beat pretty fast,\" said Sally smiling. \"I am rather bashful you  see, and worse than that, I was afraid the doctor would say like the  others, that it was the nerve and I would have to go blind, or that some  dreadful operation would be necessary; but after I had seen him and found  out how kind and pleasant he was, and that I'd nothing painful or  dangerous to go through, and might hope for good sight at last, I didn't  mind going at all.    \"It was a little tedious sitting there in the outer office among strangers  with no one to speak to, and nothing to do for hours at a time, but that  was nothing compared to what I was to gain by it.\"    Then the children wanted to know what the doctor measured eyes with, and  how he did it, and Sally amused them very much by telling how she had to  say her letters every day and look at the gaslight and tell what shape it  was, etc., etc.    \"The doctor told me,\" she said, addressing Mrs. Travilla, \"that I would  not like the glasses at first, hardly any one does; but I do, though not  so well, I dare say, as I shall after a while when I get used to them.\"    Mrs. Gibson's health was improving so that she was in a fair way to  recover and as she was well taken care of and did not need her daughter,  Sally felt at liberty to stay with these kind friends and enjoy herself.    She resolved to put away care and anxiety for the future, and take the  full benefit of her present advantages. Yet there was one trouble that  would intrude itself and rob her of half her enjoyment. Tom, her only and  dearly loved brother, was fast traveling the downward road, seeming wholly  given up to the dominion of the love of strong drink and kindred vices.    It was long since she had seen or heard from him and she knew not where he  was. He had been in the habit of leaving their poor home on the Hudson  without deigning to give her or his mother any information as to whither  he was bound or when he would return; sometimes coming back in a few  hours, and again staying away for days, weeks or months.    One day Elsie saw Sally turn suddenly pale while glancing over the morning  paper and there was keen distress in the eyes she lifted to hers as the  paper fell from her nerveless hand.    \"Poor child; what is it?\" Elsie asked compassionately, going to her and  taking the cold hand in hers, \"anything that I can relieve or help you to  bear?\"    \"Tom!\" and Sally burst into almost hysterical weeping.    He had been arrested in Philadelphia for drunkenness and disorderly  conduct, fined and sent to prison till the amount should be paid.    Elsie did her best to comfort the poor sister, who was in an agony of  shame and grief. \"Oh,\" she sobbed, \"he is such a dear fellow if only he  could let drink alone! but it's been his ruin, his ruin! He must feel so  disgraced that all his self-respect is gone and he'll never hold up his  head again or have the heart to try to do better.\"    \"Don't despair, poor child!\" said Elsie, \"he has not fallen too far for  the grace of God to reclaim him; 'Behold the Lord's hand is not shortened,  that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear.'\"    \"And oh, I cry day and night to him for my poor Tom, so weak, so beset  with temptations!\" exclaimed the girl, \"and will he not hear me at last?\"    \"He will if you ask in faith pleading the merits of his Son,\" returned her  friend in moved tones.    \"He must be saved!\" Mr. Travilla said with energy, when Elsie repeated to  him this conversation with Sally. \"I shall take the next train for  Philadelphia and try to find him.\"    Tom was found, his fine paid, his release procured, his rags exchanged for  neat gentlemanly attire, hope of better things for this world and the next  set before him, and with self-respect and manhood partially restored by  all this and the kindly considerate, brotherly manner of his benefactor,  he was persuaded to go with the latter to share with Sally for a few  weeks, the hospitality of that pleasant seaside home.    He seemed scarcely able to lift his eyes from the ground as Mr. Travilla  led him into the veranda where the whole family were gathered eagerly  awaiting their coming; but in a moment Sally's arms were round his neck,  her kisses and tears warm on his cheek, as she sobbed out in excess of  joy, \"O Tom, dear Tom, I'm so glad to see you!\"    Then Mrs. Travilla's soft white hand grasped his in cordial greeting, and  her low sweet voice bade him welcome; and the children echoed her words,  apparently with no other thought of him than that he was Sally's brother  and it was perfectly natural he should be there with her.    So he was soon at ease among them; but felt very humble, kept close by  Sally and used his eyes and ears far more than his tongue.    His kind entertainers exerted themselves to keep him out of the way of  temptation and help him to conquer the thirst for intoxicating drink, Mrs.  Travilla giving Sally carte blanche to go into the kitchen and prepare him  a cup of strong coffee whenever she would.    \"Sally,\" he said to his sister, one evening when they sat alone together  on the veranda, \"what a place this is to be in! It's like a little heaven  below; there is so much of peace and love; the moral atmosphere is so  sweet and pure: I feel as though I had no business here, such a fallen  wretch as I am!\" he concluded with a groan, hiding his face in his hands.    \"Don't, Tom, dear Tom!\" she whispered, putting her arms about his neck and  laying her head on his shoulder. \"You've given up that dreadful habit?  you're never going back to it?\"    \"I don't want to! God knows I don't!\" he cried as in an agony of fear,  \"but that awful thirst--you don't know what it is! and I--I'm weak as  water. Oh if there was none of the accursed thing on the face of the  earth, I might hope for salvation! Sally, I'm afraid of myself, of the  demon that is in me!\"    \"O, Tom, fly to Jesus!\" she said, clinging to him. \"He says, 'In me is  thine help.' 'Fear not; I will help thee,' and he never yet turned a deaf  ear to any poor sinner that cried to him for help. Cast yourself wholly on  him and he will give you strength; for 'every one that asketh, receiveth;  and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be  opened.'\"    There was a moment of silence, in which Sally's heart was going up in  earnest prayer for him; then Mr. Travilla joined them and addressing Tom  said, \"My wife and I have been talking about your future; indeed Sally's  also; for we suppose you would like to keep together.\"    \"That we should,\" they said.    \"Well, how would you like to emigrate to Kansas and begin life anew; away  from all old associates? I need not add that if you decide to go the means  shall not be wanting.\"    \"Thank you, sir; you have been the best of friends to us both, and to our  mother, you and Mrs. Travilla,\" said Tom, with emotion: \"and this is just  what Sally and I have been wishing we could do. I understand something of  farming and should like to take up a claim out there in some good location  where land is given to those who will settle on it."]]]
