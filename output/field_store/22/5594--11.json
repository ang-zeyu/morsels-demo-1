How many make       themselves cheap by these occasions, whom we had valued highly       if they had frequented us less! And how many frequent persons       who laugh at that simplicity which the addresser admires in       himself as wit, and yet both recreate themselves with double       laughters!         In solitude, he addresses his friend:--\"My dear Celador, enter       into your own breast, and there survey the several operations       of your own soul, the progress of your passions, the       strugglings of your appetite, the wanderings of your fancy, and       ye will find, I assure you, more variety in that one piece than       there is to be learned in all the courts of Christendom.       Represent to yourself the last age, all the actions and       interests in it, how much this person was infatuated with zeal,       that person with lust; how much one pursued honour, and another       riches; and in the next thought draw that scene, and represent       them all turned to dust and ashes!\"    I cannot close this subject without the addition of some anecdotes,  which may be useful. A man of letters finds solitude necessary, and for  him solitude has its pleasures and its conveniences; but we shall find  that it also has a hundred things to be dreaded.    Solitude is indispensable for literary pursuits. No considerable work  has yet been composed, but its author, like an ancient magician, retired  first to the grove or the closet, to invocate his spirits. Every  production of genius must be the production of enthusiasm. When the  youth sighs and languishes, and feels himself among crowds in an irksome  solitude,--that is the moment to fly into seclusion and meditation.  Where can he indulge but in solitude the fine romances of his soul?  where but in solitude can he occupy himself in useful dreams by night,  and, when the morning rises, fly without interruption to his unfinished  labours? Retirement to the frivolous is a vast desert, to the man of  genius it is the enchanted garden of Armida.    Cicero was uneasy amidst applauding Rome, and he has designated his  numerous works by the titles of his various villas, where they were  composed. Voltaire had talents, and a taste for society, yet he not only  withdrew by intervals, but at one period of his life passed five years  in the most secret seclusion and fervent studies. Montesquieu quitted  the brilliant circles of Paris for his books, his meditations, and for  his immortal work, and was ridiculed by the gay triflers he  relinquished. Harrington, to compose his Oceana, severed himself from  the society of his friends, and was so wrapped in abstraction, that he  was pitied as a lunatic. Descartes, inflamed by genius, abruptly breaks  off all his friendly connexions, hires an obscure house in an  unfrequented corner at Paris, and applies himself to study during two  years unknown to his acquaintance. Adam Smith, after the publication of  his first work, throws himself into a retirement that lasted ten years;  even Hume rallied him for separating himself from the world; but the  great political inquirer satisfied the world, and his friends, by his  great work on the Wealth of Nations.    But this solitude, at first a necessity, and then a pleasure, at length  is not borne without repining. I will call for a witness a great genius,  and he shall speak himself. Gibbon says, \"I feel, and shall continue to  feel, that domestic solitude, however it may be alleviated by the world,  by study, and even by friendship, is a comfortless state, which will  grow more painful as I descend in the vale of years.\" And afterwards he  writes to a friend, \"Your visit has only served to remind me that man,  however amused and occupied in his closet, was not made to live alone.\"    I must therefore now sketch a different picture of literary solitude  than some sanguine and youthful minds conceive.    Even the sublimest of men, Milton, who is not apt to vent complaints,  appears to have felt this irksome period of life. In the preface to  Smectymnuus, he says, \"It is but justice, not to defraud of due esteem  the _wearisome labours_ and _studious watchings,_ wherein I have spent  and _tired_ out almost a whole youth.\"    Solitude in a later period of life, or rather the neglect which awaits  the solitary man, is felt with acuter sensibility. Cowley, that  enthusiast for rural seclusion, in his retirement calls himself \"The  melancholy Cowley.\" Mason has truly transferred the same epithet to  Gray. Bead in his letters the history of solitude. We lament the loss of  Cowley's correspondence, through the mistaken notion of Sprat; he  assuredly had painted the sorrows of his heart. But Shenstone has filled  his pages with the cries of an amiable being whose soul bleeds in the  dead oblivion of solitude. Listen to his melancholy expressions:--\"Now I  am come from a visit, every little uneasiness is sufficient to  introduce my whole train of melancholy considerations, and to make me  utterly dissatisfied with the life I now lead, and the life I foresee I  shall lead. I am angry, and envious, and dejected, and frantic, and  disregard all present things, as becomes a madman to do. I am infinitely  pleased (though it is a gloomy joy) with the application of Dr. Swift's  complaint, that he is forced to die in a rage, like a poisoned rat in a  hole.\" Let the lover of solitude muse on its picture throughout the  year, in the following stanza by the same poet:--        Tedious again to curse the drizzling day,        Again to trace the wintry tracks of snow!      Or, soothed by vernal airs, again survey        The self-same hawthorns bud, and cowslips blow!    Swift's letters paint in terrifying colours a picture of solitude, and  at length his despair closed with idiotism. The amiable Gresset could  not sport with the brilliant wings of his butterfly muse, without  dropping some querulous expression on the solitude of genius. In his  \"Epistle to his Muse,\" he exquisitely paints the situation of men of  genius:        ----Je les vois, victimes du genie,      Au foible prix d'un eclat passager,      Vivre isoles, sans jouir de la vie!    And afterwards he adds,        Vingt ans d'ennuis, pour quelques jours de gloire!    I conclude with one more anecdote on solitude, which may amuse. When  Menage, attacked by some, and abandoned by others, was seized by a fit  of the spleen, he retreated into the country, and gave up his famous  Mercuriales; those Wednesdays when the literati assembled at his house,  to praise up or cry down one another, as is usual with the literary  populace. Menage expected to find that tranquillity in the country which  he had frequently described in his verses; but as he was only a poetical  plagiarist, it is not strange that our pastoral writer was greatly  disappointed. Some country rogues having killed his pigeons, they gave  him more vexation than his critics. He hastened his return to Paris. \"It  is better,\" he observed, \"since we are born to suffer, to feel only  reasonable sorrows.\"          LITERARY FRIENDSHIPS.      The memorable friendship of Beaumont and Fletcher so closely united  their labours, that we cannot discover the productions of either; and  biographers cannot, without difficulty, compose the memoirs of the one,  without running into the life of the other. They pourtrayed the same  characters, while they mingled sentiment with sentiment; and their days  were as closely interwoven as their verses. Metastasio and Farinelli  were born about the same time, and early acquainted. They called one  another _Gemello_, or The Twin, both the delight of Europe, both lived  to an advanced age, and died nearly at the same time. Their fortune  bore, too, a resemblance; for they were both pensioned, but lived and  died separated in the distant courts of Vienna and Madrid. Montaigne and  Charron were rivals, but always friends; such was Montaigne's affection  for Charron, that he permitted him by his will to bear the full arms of  his family; and Charron evinced his gratitude to the manes of his  departed friend, by leaving his fortune to the sister of Montaigne, who  had married. Forty years of friendship, uninterrupted by rivalry or  envy, crowned the lives of Poggius and Leonard Aretin, two of the  illustrious revivers of letters. A singular custom formerly prevailed  among our own writers, which was an affectionate tribute to our literary  veterans by young writers. The former adopted the latter by the title of  sons. Ben Jonson had twelve of these poetical sons. Walton the angler  adopted Cotton, the translator of Montaigne.    Among the most fascinating effusions of genius are those little pieces  which it consecrates to the cause of friendship. In that poem of Cowley,  composed on the death of his friend Harvey, the following stanza  presents a pleasing picture of the employments of two young students:--        Say, for you saw us, ye immortal lights,      How oft unwearied have we spent the nights!      Till the Ledaean stars, so famed for love,      Wondered at us from above.      We spent them not in toys, in lust, or wine,         But search of deep philosophy,         Wit, eloquence, and poetry,      Arts which I loved, for they, my friend, were thine.    Milton has not only given the exquisite Lycidas to the memory of a  young friend, but in his _Epitaphium Damonis_, to that of Deodatus, has  poured forth some interesting sentiments. It has been versified by  Langhorne. Now, says the poet,        To whom shall I my hopes and fears impart,      Or trust the cares and follies of my heart?    The elegy of Tickell, maliciously called by Steele \"prose in rhyme,\" is  alike inspired by affection and fancy; it has a melodious languor, and a  melancholy grace. The sonnet of Gray to the memory of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16351"],[0,"Critical and Historical Essays (#13)"],[1,"ucius,  Aeschylus, Sophocles, Sappho, Pindar, Phidias, and Herodotus as  contemporaries--and this list might be vastly extended--it seems  as if some strange wave of ideality had poured over mankind.  In Greece, however, Pythagoras's theory of metempsychosis  (doctrine of the supposed transmigration of the soul from  one body to another) was not strong enough to make permanent  headway, and his scientific theories unhappily turned music  from its natural course into the workshop of science, from  which Aristoxenus in vain attempted to rescue it.    At that time Homer's hexameter had begun to experience many  changes, and from the art of rhythm developed that of rhyme and  form. The old lyre, from having four strings, was developed by  Terpander, victor in the first musical contest at the feast  of Apollo Carneius, into an instrument of seven strings, to  which Pythagoras[05] added an eighth, Theophrastus a ninth,  and so on until the number of eighteen was reached.    Flute and lyre playing had attained a high state of excellence,  for we hear that Lasus, the teacher of the poet Pindar  (himself the son of a Theban flute player), introduced into  lyre playing the runs and light passages which, until that time,  it had been thought possible to produce only on the flute.    The dance also had undergone a wonderful development  rhythmically; for even in Homer's time we read in \"The Odyssey\"  of the court of Alcinoues at Phocaea, how two princes danced  before Ulysses and played with a scarlet ball, one throwing  it high in the air, the other always catching it with his  feet off the ground; and then changing, they flung the ball  from one to the other with such rapidity that it made the  onlookers dizzy. During the play, Demidocus chanted a song,  and accompanied the dance with his lyre, the players never  losing a step. As Aristides (died 468 B.C.), speaking of  Greek music many centuries later said: \"Metre is not a thing  which concerns the ear alone, for in the dance it is to be  _seen_.\" Even a statue was said to have silent rhythm, and  pictures were spoken of as being musical or unmusical.    Already in Homer's time, the Cretans had six varieties of  [5/4] time to which they danced:      [4 8 4 | 4 8 8 8 | 8 4 8 8 | 8 8 4 8 | 8 8 8 4 | 8 8 8 8 8]    [- ' - | - ' ' ' | ' - ' ' | ' ' - ' | ' ' ' - | ' ' ' ' ']    The first was known as the Cretic foot, being in a way the model  or type from which the others were made; but the others were  called paeons. The \"Hymn to Apollo\" was called a paeon or paean,  for the singers danced in Cretic rhythms as they chanted it.    There were many other dances in Greece, each having its  characteristic rhythm. For instance, the Molossian dance  consisted of three long steps, [- - -] ([3/2]); that of the  Laconians was the dactyl, [- ' '] ([4/4]), which was sometimes  reversed [' ' -] ([4/4]). In the latter form it was also the  chief dance of the Locrians, the step being called anapaest.  From Ionia came the two long and two short steps, [- - ' '],  ([3/4: 4 4 8 8]), or [' ' - -] ([3/4: 8 8 4 4]), which were  called Ionic feet. The Doric steps consisted primarily of a  trochee and a spondee, [- ' - -] or [7/8] time. These values,  however, were arranged in three other different orders, namely,  [' - - - | - - ' - | - - - '] and were called the first,  second, third, or fourth epitrite, according to the positions  of the short step. The second epitrite was considered the most  distinctly Doric.    The advent of the Dionysian[06] festivals in Greece threatened  to destroy art, for those wild Bacchic dances, which are to  be traced back to that frenzied worship of Bel and Astarte  in Babylon, wild dances amenable only to the impulse of the  moment, seemed to carry everything before them. Instead of that,  however, the hymns to Bacchus, who was called in Phoenicia  the flute god, from which the characteristics of his worship  are indicated, were the germs from which tragedy and comedy  developed, and the mad bacchanalian dances were tamed into  dithyrambs. For the Corybantes, priests of the goddess Cybele,  brought from Phrygia, in Asia Minor, the darker form of this  worship; they mourned for the death of Bacchus, who was supposed  to die in winter and to come to life again in the spring. When  these mournful hymns were sung, a goat was sacrificed on the  altar; thus the origin of the word \"tragedy\" or \"goat song\"  (_tragos_, goat, and _odos_, singer). As the rite developed,  the leader of the chorus would chant the praises of Dionysus,  and sing of his adventures, to which the chorus would make  response. In time it became the custom for the leader,  or coryphaeus, to be answered by one single member of the  chorus, the latter being thus used merely for the chanting  of commentaries on the narrative. The answerer was called  \"hypocrite,\" afterward the term for actor.    This was the material from which Aeschylus created the  first tragedy, as we understand the term. Sophocles (495-406  B.C.) followed, increasing the number of actors, as did also  Euripides (480-406 B.C.).    Comedy (_komos_, revel, and _odos_, singer) arose from the  spring and summer worship of Bacchus, when everything was a  jest and Nature smiled again.    The dithyramb (_dithyrambos_ or Bacchic step, [- ' ' -])  brought a new step to the dance and therefore a new element  into poetry, for all dances were choric, that is to say they  were sung as well as danced.    Arion was the first to attempt to bring the dithyramb into  poetry, by teaching the dancers to use a slower movement and to  observe greater regularity in their various steps. The Lydian  flute, as may be supposed, was the instrument which accompanied  the dithyramb, associated with all kinds of harsh, clashing  instruments, such as cymbals, tambourines, castanets. These  Arion tried to replace by the more dignified Grecian lyre;  but it was long before this mad dance sobered down to regular  rhythm and form. From Corinth, where Arion first laboured,  we pass to Sicyon, where the taming of the dithyramb into an  art form was accomplished by Praxilla, a poetess who added a  new charm to the lilt of this Bacchic metre, namely, rhyme.    And this newly acquired poetic wealth was in keeping with  the increasing luxury and magnificence of the cities, for  we read in Athenaeus and Diodorus that Agrigentum sent to  the Olympic games three hundred chariots, drawn by white  horses. The citizens wore garments of cloth of gold, and even  their household ornaments were of gold and silver; in their  houses they had wine cellars which contained three hundred  vats, each holding a hundred hogsheads of wine. In Sybaris  this luxury reached its height, for the Sybarites would not  allow any trade which caused a disagreeable sound, such as  that of the blacksmith, carpenter, or mason, to be carried on  in their city limits. They dressed in garments of deep purple,  tied their hair in gold threads, and the city was famed for  its incessant banqueting and merrymaking. It was such luxury  as this that Pindar found at the court of Hiero, at Syracuse,  whither Aeschylus had retired after his defeat by Sophocles  at the Dionysian Festival at Athens.    The worship of Bacchus being at its height at that time, it may  be imagined that wine formed the principal element of their  feasts. And even as the dithyramb had been pressed into the  service of poetry, so was drinking made rhythmic by music. For  even the wine was mixed with water according to musical ratios;  for instance, the paeonic or 3 to 2, [' ' ' -] = [8 8 8 4];  the iambic or 2 to 1, [- '] = [4 8]; dactylic or 2 to 2,  [- ' '] = [4. 8 8]. The master of the feast decided the ratio,  and a flute girl played a prescribed melody while the toast  to good fortune, which commenced every banquet, was being  drunk. By the time the last note had sounded, the great cup  should have gone round the table and been returned to the  master. And then they had the game of the cottabos, which  consisted of throwing the contents of a wine cup high in the  air in such a manner that the wine would fall in a solid mass  into a metal basin. The winner was the one who produced the  clearest musical sound from the basin.    We see from all this that music was considered rather  a beautiful plaything or a mere colour. By itself it was  considered effeminate; therefore the early Greeks always had the  flute player accompanied by a singer, and the voice was always  used with the lyre to prevent the latter appealing directly  to the senses. The dance was corrected in the same manner;  for when we speak of Greek dances, we always mean _choric_  dances. Perhaps the nearest approach to the effect of what  we call music was made by Aeschylus, in the last scene of his  \"Persians,\" when Xerxes and the chorus end the play with one  continued wail of sorrow. In this instance the words take  second place, and the actual sound is depended upon for the  dramatic effect.    The rise and fall of actual instrumental music in Greece may  be placed between 500 and 400 B.C. After the close of the  Peloponnesian War (404 B.C.), when Sparta supplanted Athens as  the leader of Greece, art declined rapidly, and at the time  of Philip of Macedon (328 B.C.) may be said to have been  practically extinct. Then, in place of the dead ashes of art,  the cold fire of science arose; for we have such men as Euclid  (300 B.C.) and his school applying mathematics to musical  sounds, and a system of cold calculation to an art that had  needed all the warmth of emotional enthusiasm to keep it alive.  Thus music became a science. Had it not been for the little  weeds of folk song which managed with difficulty to survive at  the foot of this arid dust heap, and which were destined to be  transformed and finally to bloom into such lovely flowers in  our times, we might yet have been using the art to illustrate  mathematical calculations.    The teaching of Pythagoras was the "]]]
