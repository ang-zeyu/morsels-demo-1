The internal construction of the \"Second Pyramid\" is less elaborate than  that of the Third, but not very different. Two passages lead from the  outer air to a sepulchral chamber almost exactly under the apex of the  pyramid, and exactly at its base, one of them commencing about fifty  feet from the base midway in the north side, and the other commencing a  little outside the base, in the pavement at the foot of the pyramid. The  first passage was carried through the substance of the pyramid for a  distance of a hundred and ten feet at a descending angle of 25 deg. 55',  after which it became horizontal, and was tunnelled through the native  rock on which the pyramid was built. The second passage was wholly in  the rock. It began with a descent at an angle of 21 deg. 40', which  continued for a hundred feet; it was then horizontal for fifty feet;  after which it ascended gently for ninety-six feet, and joined the first  passage about midway between the sepulchral chamber and the outer air.  The sepulchral chamber was carved mainly out of the solid rock below the  pyramid, but was roofed in by some of the basement stones, which were  sloped at an angle. The chamber measured forty-six feet in length and  sixteen feet in breadth; its height in the centre was twenty-two feet.  It contained a plain granite sarcophagus, without inscription of any  kind, eight feet and a half in length, three feet and a half in breadth,  and in depth three feet. There was no coffin in the sarcophagus at the  time of its discovery, and no inscription on any part of the pyramid or  of its contents. The tradition, however, which ascribed it to the  immediate predecessor of Men-kau-ra, may be accepted as sufficient  evidence of its author.    [Illustration: SARCOPHAGUS OF MYCERINUS.]    [Illustration: SECTION OF THE SECOND PYRAMID.]    Come we now to the \"Great Pyramid,\" \"which is still,\" says Lenormant,  \"at least in respect of its mass, _the most prodigious of all human  constructions_,\" The \"Great Pyramid,\" or \"First Pyramid of Ghizeh,\" as  it is indifferently termed, is situated almost due north-east of the  \"Second Pyramid,\" at the distance of about two hundred yards. The length  of each side at the base was originally seven hundred and sixty-four  feet, or fifty-seven feet more than that of the sides of the \"Second  Pyramid.\" Its original perpendicular height was something over four  hundred and eighty feet, its cubic contents exceeded eighty-nine million  feet, and the weight of its mass 6,840,000 tons. In height it thus  exceeded Strasburg Cathedral by above six feet, St. Peter's at Rome by  above thirty feet, St. Stephen's at Vienna by fifty feet St. Paul's,  London, by a hundred and twenty feet, and the Capitol at Washington by  nearly two hundred feet. Its area was thirteen acres, one rood, and  twenty-two poles, or nearly two acres more than the area of the \"Second  Pyramid.\" which was fourfold that of the \"Third Pyramid,\" which, as we  have seen, was that of an ordinary London square. Its cubic contents  would build a city of twenty-two thousand such houses as were above  described, and laid in a line of cubic squares would reach a distance of  nearly seventeen thousand miles, or girdle two-thirds of the earth's  circumference at the equator. Herodotus says that its construction  required the continuous labour of a hundred thousand men for the space  of twenty years, and moderns do not regard the estimate as exaggerated.    The \"Great Pyramid\" presents, moreover, many other marvels besides its  size. First, there is the massiveness of the blocks of which it is  composed. The basement stones are in many cases thirty feet long by  five feet high, and four or five wide: they must contain from six  hundred to seven hundred and fifty cubic feet each, and weigh from  forty-six to fifty-seven tons. The granite blocks which roof over the  upper sepulchral chamber are nearly nineteen feet long, by two broad and  from three to four deep. The relieving stones above the same chamber,  and those of the entrance passage, are almost equally massive. Generally  the external blocks are of a size with which modern builders scarcely  ever venture to deal, though the massiveness diminishes as the pyramid  is ascended. The bulk of the interior is, however, of comparatively  small stones; but even these are carefully hewn and squared, so as to  fit together compactly.    [Illustration: SECTION OF THE GREAT PYRAMID.]    [Illustration: KING'S CHAMBER AND CHAMBERS OF CONSTRUCTION, GREAT  PYRAMID.]    Further, there are the passages, the long gallery, the ventilation  shafts, and the sepulchral chambers all of them remarkable, and some of  them simply astonishing. The \"Great Pyramid\" guards three chambers. One  lies deep in the rock, about a hundred and twenty feet beneath the  natural surface of the ground, and is placed almost directly below the  apex of the structure. It measures forty-six feet by twenty-seven, and  is eleven feet high. The access to it is by a long and narrow passage  which commences in the north side of the pyramid, about seventy feet  above the original base, and descends for forty yards through the  masonry, and then for seventy more in the same line through the solid  rock, when it changes its direction, becoming horizontal for nine yards,  and so entering the chamber itself. The two other chambers are reached  by an ascending passage, which branches off from the descending one at  the distance of about thirty yards from the entrance, and mounts up  through the heart of the pyramid for rather more than forty yards, when  it divides into two. A low horizontal gallery, a hundred and ten feet  long, leads to a chamber which has been called \"the Queen's\"--a room  about nineteen feet long by seventeen broad, roofed in with sloping  blocks, and having a height of twenty feet in the centre. Another longer  and much loftier gallery continues on for a hundred and fifty feet in  the line of the ascending passage, and is then connected by a short  horizontal passage with the upper-most or \"King's Chamber.\" Here was  found a sarcophagus believed to be that of King Khufu, since the name of  Khufu was scrawled in more than one place on the chamber walls.    [Illustration: GALLERY IN THE GREAT PYRAMID.]    The construction of this chamber--the very kernel of the whole  building--is exceedingly remarkable. It is a room of thirty-four feet in  length, with a width of seventeen feet, and a height of nineteen,  composed wholly of granite blocks of great size, beautifully polished,  and fitted together with great care. The construction of the roof is  particularly admirable. First, the chamber is covered in with nine huge  blocks, each nearly nineteen feet long and four feet wide, which are  laid side by side upon the walls so as to form a complete ceiling. Then  above these blocks is a low chamber similarly covered in, and this is  repeated four times; after which there is a fifth opening,  triangular, and roofed in by a set of huge sloping blocks, which meet at  the apex and support each other. The object is to relieve the chamber  from any superincumbent weight, and prevent it from being crushed in by  the mass of material above it; and this object has been so completely  attained that still, at the expiration of above forty centuries, the  entire chamber, with its elaborate roof, remains intact, without crack  or settlement of any kind.    Further, from the great chamber are carried two ventilation-shafts, or  air-passages, northwards and southwards, which open on the outer surface  of the pyramid, and are respectively two hundred and thirty-three and  one hundred and ninety-four feet long. These passages are square, or  nearly so, and have a diameter varying between six and nine inches. They  give a continual supply of pure air to the chamber, and keep it dry at  all seasons.    The Great Gallery is also of curious construction. Extending for a  distance of one hundred and fifty feet, and rising at an angle of 26 deg.  18', it has a width of five feet at the base and a height of above  thirty feet. The side walls are formed of seven layers of stone, each  projecting a few inches over that below it. The gallery thus gradually  contracts towards the top, which has a width of four feet only, and is  covered in with stones that reach across it, and rest on the walls at  either side. The exact object of so lofty a gallery has not been  ascertained; but it must have helped to keep the air of the interior  pure and sweet, by increasing the space through which it had to  circulate.    The \"Pyramid Builders,\" or kings who constructed the three monuments  that have now been described, were, according to a unanimous tradition,  three consecutive monarchs, whose native names are read as Khufu,  Shafra, and Menkaura. These kings belonged to Manetho's fourth dynasty;  and Khufu, the first of the three, seems to have been the immediate  successor of Sneferu. Theorists have delighted to indulge in  speculations as to the objects which the builders had in view when they  raised such magnificent constructions. One holds that the Great Pyramid,  at any rate, was built to embody cosmic discoveries, as the exact length  of the earth's diameter and circumference, the length of an arc of the  meridian, and the true unit of measure. Another believes the great work  of Khufu to have been an observatory, and the ventilating passages to  have been designed for \"telescopes,\" through which observations were to  be made upon the sun and stars; but it has not yet been shown that there  is any valid foundation for these fancies, which have been spun with  much art out of the delicate fabric of their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15665"],[0,"New Latin Grammar (#13)"],[1,"TER.    _Nom._  qui         quae       quod       qui         quae       quae    _Gen._  cujus       cujus      cujus      quorum      quarum     quorum    _Dat._  cui         cui        cui        quibus[26]  quibus     quibus    _Acc._  quem        quam       quod       quos        quas       quae    _Abl._  quo[27]     qua[27]    quo        quibus[26]  quibus     quibus           *       *       *       *       *    VII. INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS.    90. The Interrogative Pronouns are quis, _who?_ (substantive) and qui,  _what? what kind of?_ (adjective).    1. Quis, _who_?                        SINGULAR.               PLURAL.            MASC. AND FEM.   NEUTER    _Nom._  quis             quid             The rare Plural    _Gen._  cujus            cujus            follows the declension    _Dat._  cui              cui              of the Relative Pronoun.    _Acc._  quem             quid    _Abl._  quo              quo    2. Qui, _what? what kind of?_ is declined precisely like the Relative  Pronoun; viz. qui, quae, quod, etc.      a. An old Ablative qui occurs, in the sense of _how? why?_      b. Qui is sometimes used for quis in Indirect Questions.      c. Quis, when limiting words denoting persons, is sometimes an adjective.    But in such cases quis homo = _what man?_ whereas qui homo = _what sort    of man?_      d. Quis and qui may be strengthened by adding -nam. Thus:--      Substantive:    quisnam, _who, pray?_ quidnam, _what, pray?_    Adjective:      quinam, quaenam, quodnam, _of what kind, pray?_           *       *       *       *       *    VIII. INDEFINITE PRONOUNS.    91. These have the general force of _some one_, _any one_.          SUBSTANTIVES.                 ADJECTIVES.    M. AND F.               NEUT.         MASC.       FEM.        NEUT.    quis,                   quid,         qui,        quae, qua,  quod,    _any one_, _anything_.               _any_.    aliquis,                aliquid,      aliqui,     aliqua,     aliquod,         _some one_,                     _any_.         _something_.    quisquam,               quidquam,     quisquam,               quidquam,    _any one_, _anything_.            _any_ (rare)    quispiam,               quidpiam,     quispiam,   quaepiam,   quodpiam,    _any one_, _anything_.               _any_.    quisque,                quidque,      quisque,    quaeque,    quodque,           _each_.                      _each_.    quivis,     quaevis,    quidvis,      quivis,     quaevis,    quodvis,    quilibet,   quaelibet,  quidlibet     quilibet,   quaelibet,  quodlibet,    _any one_ (_anything_)           _any you wish_          _you wish_    quidam,     quaedam,    quiddam,      quidam,     quaedam,    quoddam,    _a certain person_, or            _a certain_           _thing_.    1. In the Indefinite Pronouns, only the pronominal part is declined. Thus:  Genitive Singular alicujus, cujuslibet, etc.    2. Note that aliqui has aliqua in the Nominative Singular Feminine, also in  the Nominative and Accusative Plural Neuter. Qui has both qua and quae in  these same cases.    3. Quidam forms Accusative Singular quendam, quandam; Genitive Plural  quorundam, quarundam; the m being assimilated to n before d.    4. Aliquis may be used adjectively, and (occasionally) aliqui  substantively.    5. In combination with ne, si, nisi, num, either quis or qui may stand as a  Substantive. Thus: si quis or si qui.    6. Ecquis, _any one_, though strictly an Indefinite, generally has  interrogative force. It has both substantive and adjective  forms,--substantive, ecquis, ecquid; adjective, ecqui, ecquae and ecqua,  ecquod.    7. Quisquam is not used in the Plural.    8. There are two Indefinite Relatives,--quicumque and quisquis, _whoever_.  Quicumque declines only the first part; quisquis declines both but has only  quisquis, quidquid, quoquo, in common use.           *       *       *       *       *    PRONOMINAL ADJECTIVES.    92. The following adjectives, also, frequently have pronominal force:--      1.  alius, _another;_                    alter, _the other;_      uter, _which of two?_ (interr.);     neuter, _neither;_      _whichever of two_ (rel.);      unus, _one_;                         nullus, _no one_ (in oblique                                           cases)    2. The compounds,--      uterque, utraque, utrumque, _each of two;_    utercumque, utracumque, utrumcumque, _whoever of two;_    uterlibet, utralibet, utrumlibet, _either one you please;_    utervis, utravis, utrumvis, _either one you please;_    alteruter, alterutra, alterutrum, _the one or the other_.    In these, uter alone is declined. The rest of the word remains unchanged,  except in case of alteruter, which may decline both parts; as,--      _Nom._  alteruter       altera utra     alterum utrum    _Gen._  alterius utrius, etc.           *       *       *       *       *    CHAPTER II.--_Conjugation._    93. A Verb is a word which asserts something; as, est, _he is_; amat, _he  loves_. The Inflection of Verbs is called Conjugation.    94. Verbs have Voice, Mood, Tense, Number, and Person:--      1. Two Voices,--Active and Passive.      2. Three Moods,--Indicative, Subjunctive, Imperative.      3. Six Tenses,--        Present,         Perfect,      Imperfect,       Pluperfect,      Future,          Future                       Perfect.      But the Subjunctive lacks the Future and Future Perfect; while the    Imperative employs only the Present and Future.      4. Two Numbers,--Singular and Plural.      5. Three Persons,--First, Second, and Third.    95. These make up the so-called _Finite Verb_. Besides this, we have the  following Noun and Adjective Forms:--      1. Noun Forms,--Infinitive, Gerund, and Supine.      2. Adjective Forms,--Participles (including the Gerundive).    96. The Personal Endings of the Verb are,--                  Active.                       Passive.    _Sing_. 1.  -o; -m; -i (Perf. Ind.);      -r.            2.  -s; -sti (Perf Ind.);         -ris, -re;                -to or wanting (Impv.);       -re, -tor (Impv.).            3.  -t; -to (Impv.);              -tur; -tor (Impv.).     _Plu_. 1.  -mus;                         -mur.            2.  -tis; -stis (Perf. Ind.);     -mini.                -te, -tote (Impv.);            3.  -nt; -erunt (Perf Ind.);      -ntur; -ntor (Impv.).                -nto (Impv.);    VERB STEMS.    97. Conjugation consists in appending certain endings to the Stem. We  distinguish three different stems in a fully inflected verb,--      I. Present Stem, from which are formed--        1. Present, Imperfect, and Future Indicative,        2. Present and Imperfect Subjunctive,        3. The Imperative,        4. The Present Infinitive,        - (Active and Passive.)        5. The Present Active Participle, the Gerund, and Gerundive.    II. Perfect Stem, from which are formed--        1. Perfect, Pluperfect, and Future Perfect Indicative,        2. Perfect and Pluperfect Subjunctive,        3. Perfect Infinitive,        - (Active.)    III. Participial Stem, from which are formed--        1. Perfect Participle,        2. Perfect, Pluperfect, and Future Perfect Indicative,        3. Perfect and Pluperfect Subjunctive,        4. Perfect Infinitive,        - (Passive.)    Apparently from the same stem, though really of different origin, are the  Supine, the Future Active Participle, the Future Infinitive Active and  Passive.    THE FOUR CONJUGATIONS.    98. There are in Latin four regular Conjugations, distinguished from each  other by the vowel of the termination of the Present Infinitive Active, as  follows:--             INFINITIVE   DISTINGUISHING    CONJUGATION.  TERMINATION.      VOWEL.      I.      -are            a     II.      -ere            e    III.      -ere            e     IV.      -ire            i    99. PRINCIPAL PARTS. The Present Indicative, Present Infinitive, Perfect  Indicative, and the Perfect Participle[28] constitute the Principal Parts  of a Latin verb,--so called because they contain the different stems, from  which the full conjugation of the verb may be derived.           *       *       *       *       *    CONJUGATION OF SUM.    100. The irregular verb sum is so important for the conjugation of all  other verbs that its inflection is given at the outset.                                 PRINCIPAL PARTS.       PRES. IND.
