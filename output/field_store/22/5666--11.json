[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17615"],[0,"In Search of the Okapi (#13)"],[1,"in showing a light, and  accordingly the lantern was hung amidships, the spirit-lamp lit, to  prepare a nourishing and at the same time \"filling\" soup. They made  a hearty meal, got into warmer clothing, oiled the rifle-barrels,  arranged their rugs, and prepared for the night, which came on them  with a rush, heralded by the noise of birds seeking their accustomed  roosting-places. Such an uproar the boys had not before heard. It  seemed as if the Zoological Gardens had emptied its noisiest  inhabitants.  Parrots flew across the river, every one talking at  the top of its voice, while colonies of ibis croaked out the news of  the day in gruff, discordant notes; cranes flying laboriously, with  long legs trailing, emitted their deep \"honks;\" frogs lifted up  their voices from out the reeds, and at intervals came the booming  cry of the shovel-beaked bittern, and the harsh, baboon-like bark of  the green-crested toucan. The noise of the home-going of the winged  multitudes ceased as the night drew its black mantle over the river.    Out of the spell of silence there grew presently other voices, soft  whisperings, deep sighings; mysterious sounds telling of things  stealthy and oppressed by the stillness; abrupt splashings that  startled by their suddenness: grunts, rumblings, and the roar of  bull crocodiles. It must not, however, be supposed that there was a  continuous succession  of sounds. Each noise had its own place, and  there would be often long intervals between one sound and another.    Venning, who had the first watch, found this out. He would hear a  startling splash, followed by a snort and the snap of jaws; then all  would be quiet for several minutes, when, from another direction,  would come perhaps a heavy sigh; then another interval of silence,  again a splash, and so on until the impression grew on him that the  beasts and reptiles who made the noises were working slowly towards  him in a circle.    It was his first night on guard in the wilderness, and he felt the  uneasiness of the hunter who discovers how limited are his senses  compared with those of the wild creatures about him. Man, himself  the most secret, the most cunning, the most deadly, and, if truth  must be told, the most bloodthirsty, for he kills too often for the  love of killing, is the most helpless in the dark. His sense of  hearing, of sight, and of smell, fail him--thanks to a wise  provision of Nature in the interests of her other children--for if  man had the eyes of a cat, the nose of a wolf, and the hearing of a  deer, he would have cleared the earth of its creatures, who would  have had no rest night or day.    All the time, too, the river talked, as it rolled its great flood  along, sending up a soft volume of song from the innumerable sounds  produced as it washed along the islands and foamed against the rocks  of the shores. Presently, down the narrow channel, there came a rush  of water which rocked the boat, and next Venning heard close at hand  a strange noise, which he took to be made by a large animal cropping  at the river-grass. He looked about for a weapon, and, picking up  the long boat-hook, lashed his hunting-knife to the iron hook at the  top, converting it into a lance. He had read of hippos swamping  boats by seizing the narrow bows or keel in their vast jaws, and he  wished to be prepared for a possible attack. Presently the boat  again rocked as another animal took to the water, then the new-comer  dislodged the other with a snap of the jaws, and the first, with a  complaining grunt, surged down the channel. Venning could see  nothing in the inky blackness, but he knew the beast had seen the  Okapi from the short note of alarm it sounded. Immediately the alarm  was repeated. Snorts and splashes arose from all sides. Some great  beast who had been standing unnoticed within a few yards of the  boat, crashed through the bushes into the water with an uproar that  woke the sleepers.    \"What is it?\" cried Compton.    Mr. Hume made a dart for his rifle.    The Okapi rocked and heaved, was lifted at the bows to fall back  with a splash.    \"Hippo,\" gasped Venning, making a drive with his weapon through the  mosquito curtains. \"Got him!--no!--missed!\"    \"What's that you've got there, Venning?\"    \"Sort of harpoon.\"    \"By gum!\" said Mr. Hume, taking the weapon, \"I'm glad you missed the  beggar. I would not give much for our chances if he turned crusty in  this place.\"    The hippo reappeared aft with a snort, and, much to their relief,  continued down the channel into the wider waters.    \"Find the watch pleasant?\" asked Compton, sleepily, as Mr. Hume  turned in.    \"Awfully cheerful,\" said Venning, earnestly; \"but I'm not selfish,  and you can take your turn at it on the tick of the hour.\"    Compton dived for his rugs, and Venning once more returned to his  duties with his harpoon over his knees, and a string of winged  visitors entering joyously by the hole he had made in the curtain.  He pinned his handkerchief  over the rent to stop further free  entrance, then made war on those which had entered--an amusement  which carried him well into the fourth and last hour of the first  watch.  Then he sat up to listen for the old sounds--the groans and  the snorts--but they had ceased. A mist, like a wet blanket, had  settled down over the Okapi, over the islands and the river; and,  though any sounds made on the water were startlingly distinct,  confined as the sound-waves were by the mist, the creatures had  evidently gone to sleep. There was, however, one visitor faithful to  him. The light of the lantern, which showed the rolling wreaths of  the mist, just reached the water, and in the reflection he saw two  greenish points. After long looking, he made out that these were the  eyes of a crocodile, whose body was half in and half out of the  water, the tail end of him being anchored on the little island. At  eleven o'clock he roused Compton by dragging at his ankle.    Compton sat up, rubbed his eyes, and drew his rug over his  shoulders.    \"What's the countersign, comrade?\" he asked, with a yawn.    \"Countersign?\"    \"Yes; when the watch is relieved he has to say something or other,  as a guide to the new man.\"    \"Oh, I see. Well, let me introduce you to the companion of  your  watch. See those green points out there?\"    \"Yes--like dull glass.\"    \"That's your new chum. He's been there an hour without moving, and  it's no good trying to stare him down.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"Crocodile. Good night. Wish you joy;\" and Venning crept  under his  waterproof sheet with a sigh of relief.    Neither of the two boys smoked, taking the advice of Mr. Hume, who  persuaded them that tobacco acted as a poison when used too early,  and spoiled good hunting. It lowered the action of the heart,  affected the hearing and the sense of smell. In place of a pipe,  therefore, Compton found comfort in chewing, not tobacco, but a meat  lozenge. As he chewed he watched the two little dull green spots,  and the crocodile watched him with the deadly patience that so often  brings grist to the mill, or, rather, food to his jaws.    It was not a pleasant companionship, and Compton, after a long  attempt to stare the reptile down, turned his back to it and watched  the efforts of several large moths to get at the light through the  mosquito curtains. He could not so much see them as hear them, from  the way they bumped into the net, and the little soft splash they  made as they dropped into the water. By-and-by there came another  sound, made by some large fish, who had also been attracted by the  light, and then by the fat moths.    The news that these were good eating quickly spread under water, and  presently there was quite a gathering about the boat. Then Compton  turned to look at his unwelcome watcher. He was still at his post,  his eyes still fixed in an unwinking stare, but seemingly brighter  than before. Yes, he was evidently nearer. He was moving! Compton  picked up the boat-hook with its dagger-ended spear, and prepared  for the attack. Slowly, almost without a ripple, the reptile  slithered into the water; then came a rush, a snap of jaws, a swirl  of waters, and something heavy and wet came right through the  mosquito nets, landing in the well of the boat with a tremendous  whack.    \"Look out,\" yelled Compton; \"keep out of his reach.\"    \"What the dickens is it now?\" roared Mr. Hume, as a series of  resounding thwacks arose out of the well.    Compton drove his harpoon into the well, and held on like grim  death, as the impaled thing lashed out to free itself.    \"A crocodile!\" he shouted. \"I can't hold him down much longer.\"    \"Crocodile be blowed!\" shouted Mr. Hume, unhooking the  lantern and  directing its light into the well. \"It's a fish.\"    \"But,\" said Compton, \"I saw the crocodile. It came straight for the  boat. Venning saw it too.\"    \"It was over there,\" said Venning, peering into the dark.    \"Then the fish must have jumped aboard to escape the crocodile.  Anyway, we can have fish-steak for  breakfast,\" and Mr. Hume quieted  the fish with a blow on the head.    \"I made sure it was the crocodile,\" said Compton, in an aggrieved  tone. \"Look at the hole in the curtains; there'll be tons of  skeeters aboard.\"    \"You turn in and I'll smoke,\" said the hunter, who smoked enough for  three; and, with his pipe filled and lit, he took up the watch.    Once more the little party settled down to pass the night, and this  time there was no disturbance until, in the chill of the early  morning, the sleepers were awakened to get in the awning, to make  all shipshape aboard, and to prepare breakfast. The fish was not  handsome-looking, but he cut up into really good steaks, which were  grilled on a gridiron fitted over the stove, and, with hot coffee  and a biscuit apiece, they ate a meal which made them proof against  the depressing surroundings.    Both Compton and Venning, as soon as there was light enough,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17636"],[0,"The Mystery at Putnam Hall: The School Chums' Strange Discovery (#13)"],[1," were in bed, and one  after another lost himself in the land of dreams.    The day had been a particularly strenuous one for Jack and the young  major slept soundly until the rising-bell rang loudly. Then he rubbed  his eyes sleepily and stretched himself.    \"Wish I didn't have to get up just yet,\" he murmured. \"I could sleep  another hour without half trying.\"    \"Same here,\" responded Pepper.    \"I never feel awake until after I've had a wash,\" came from Andy, who  had just leaped up.    Soon all of the cadets in the dormitory were dressing, and one by one  they washed up and went below. Andy and Jack were the last to leave.    \"What's the matter?\" asked the acrobatic youth, as he saw the young  major searching around for something.    \"I'm looking for my watch and chain, Andy.\"    \"Where did you put it?\"    \"Where I always do--on the stand at the head of my bed.\"    \"Maybe it fell on the floor.\"    \"If it did, it isn't there now.\" Jack got down on his knees to look  around, and then turned over the bedclothes and some other things.    \"Maybe Pepper played a joke on you, Jack.\"    \"That may be so. I'll go down and ask him about it.\"    The young major looked through his clothing and all over the dormitory,  and then hurried below. As it was Sunday morning, there was no drill,  and the cadets were gathering in the mess-hall for breakfast.    \"Pepper, did you see my watch?\" asked Jack, coming up to his chum.    \"Your watch? No,\" was the ready reply.    \"You didn't?\" cried the young major, and now he was more concerned than  ever.    \"Saw it last night, when you put it on the stand as usual.\"    \"You didn't hide it? Come, now, tell the truth.\"    \"Honor bright; the last I saw of it was when you placed it on the stand  when you went to bed.\"    \"It's gone; and the chain with it.\"    \"You don't mean it, Jack! Did you look all around?\"    \"Everywhere.\"    \"Did you ask the other fellows about it?\"    \"No; but I will, right away.\"    The young major walked to one roommate after another and asked about his  watch and chain. All denied knowing anything about the timepiece.  Several had seen him place the watch on the stand at the head of the  bed, but that was all.    \"Well, it's a mystery what has become of it, that's sure,\" was Jack's  comment. \"It certainly couldn't walk off by itself.\"    \"Well, a good watch knows how to run,\" remarked Pepper, dryly, for he  couldn't help having his joke. \"But, seriously, Jack, do you think  somebody stole the watch and chain?\"    \"I don't know what to think.\"    \"I don't imagine anybody in our dormitory would do such a thing.\"    \"Neither do I. But the watch and chain are gone. The question is,  Where?\"    \"Hadn't you better report the matter to Captain Putnam?\"    \"I will, after I have taken another look around,\" answered the young  major, and left the mess-room just as the bell rang for breakfast.    \"Why did Major Ruddy leave?\" asked Josiah Crabtree, harshly, as he saw  that the young officer was missing.    \"He had something of importance to attend to,\" answered Pepper.    \"Humph! It is his duty to be at the table on time, if he wants his  breakfast,\" muttered the dictatorial teacher.    Jack did not come back for the best part of half an hour. By that time  the breakfast was nearly over.    \"Major Ruddy, what does this mean?\" demanded Josiah Crabtree.    \"A matter of importance, Mr. Crabtree,\" answered the young officer.    \"I cannot permit cadets to come in late to breakfast.\"    \"This couldn't be helped, sir. I will explain to you and to Captain  Putnam directly after I have finished.\"    \"Very well. If it is of real importance I will let it pass. But  otherwise I shall mark you for being tardy,\" returned Josiah Crabtree,  harshly.    Jack merely bowed and then he sat down and ate his breakfast. While he  was doing so, Pepper leaned over to him.    \"Find the watch?\" he whispered.    \"No--not the least trace of it,\" answered Jack.    The young major did not feel much like eating. The watch was a gold one  and the chain was also of gold, and both were valuable. They had been a  birthday gift from his parents.    \"Say, Jack, this is as bad as my loss,\" came from Andy, in a low tone.  \"What are you going to do about it?\"    \"I don't know. I want to talk the matter over with Captain Putnam  first,\" answered the young officer.          CHAPTER XII    AN INVITATION ACCEPTED      Captain Putnam looked very grave when Jack reported the loss of the gold  watch and chain.    \"You are certain you left them on the stand when you went to sleep?\" he  questioned.    \"Yes, sir. Pepper Ditmore saw me put them there, and Dale Blackmore saw  it, too.\"    \"And you have looked everywhere for them?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I will go up and look around with you.\"    \"All right, sir. But it will do no good,\" answered the young major.    \"You say that all your roommates deny taking the watch and chain.\"    \"Yes, sir. They say they didn't see the watch at all after we went to  bed.\"    \"Major Ruddy, do you suspect anybody of this crime?\" demanded the owner  of the school, looking Jack full in the face.    \"No, sir,\" was the prompt answer. \"It's a complete mystery to me. All I  know about it is, that I left the watch and chain on the stand at the  head of my bed when I went to sleep and this morning they were gone.\"    \"Did any of the other cadets enter your dormitory during the night?\"    \"Not that I know of.\"    \"They may have been skylarking and may have carried the watch and chain  off by--accident, let us say,\" finished the captain, significantly.    \"If anybody came in, nobody who sleeps in our room seems to be aware of  it.\"    Captain Putnam and Jack passed up to the dormitory, followed by Josiah  Crabtree. They were soon joined by Pepper and the other occupants of the  apartment. Another search was made, but the gold watch and chain were  not found, nor were any clues concerning the timepiece unearthed.    \"What were the watch and chain worth?\" asked Fred.    \"I don't know; maybe fifty or sixty dollars,\" answered Jack.    \"Then if they were stolen, the thief made quite a haul.\"    \"Do you think they were stolen, Century?\" demanded the owner of the  school.    \"Doesn't it look like it, sir?\"    \"But if they were stolen, who is guilty?\" asked Josiah Crabtree, glaring  around from one cadet to another.    For the moment nobody spoke.    \"I don't suspect any of my roommates,\" said Jack, quickly. \"I think it  was done by some outsider.\"    \"Some other cadet?\" asked Crabtree.    \"Possibly; or else by some of the help.\"    \"Gracious, Ruddy, I--er--I hope you don't suspect me!\" stammered the  teacher.    \"No, sir; I meant some of the servants.\"    \"Ah, I see!\" Josiah Crabtree looked relieved. \"You may be right. Perhaps  some of the new colored help took the watch,\" he went on, to Captain  Putnam.    \"I will start an investigation,\" returned the owner of the school.    Captain Putnam was as good as his word, and over an hour was spent in  questioning the help, and the other cadets, but without results. The  investigation was continued Monday morning. But not the first trace of  the missing watch and chain was discovered anywhere.    \"It assuredly is a mystery,\" said Captain Putnam at last. \"What do you  make of it, Mr. Strong?\" he asked of his second assistant.    \"It is a very unfortunate occurrence,\" answered George Strong. \"If  there is a thief in Putnam Hall we ought to locate him. As long as he  remains undetected none of us will be safe.\"    \"How are you going to catch him?\"    \"I don't know. We might try to trace up the watch and chain through the  authorities.\"    \"I hate to let the authorities know anything has been stolen in the  school. It gives us a bad name in public.\" The two men were alone, so  they could speak freely.    \"It will give the school a worse name if we don't get the watch and  chain back. I am afraid Major Ruddy can hold you for the worth of them.\"    \"He can, and I expect to pay for them if we don't get them back. I will  think it over, and perhaps I'll report the loss.\"    Later on, the authorities were notified that a watch and chain were  missing. No details were given, but the police were asked to look out  for the watch and chain in pawnbroking establishments and elsewhere.    \"I shall also offer a reward,\" said the owner of the school, and the  next day a bulletin was posted, offering a reward of ten dollars for  information leading to the recovery of the timepiece and conviction of  the thief.    \"It's tough to go without your watch, Jack,\" said Pepper.    \"Captain Putnam is going to loan me one for the present,\" was the young  major's reply. \"It's only a silver affair, but he says it keeps good  time, and that's the main thing.\"    A day or two after the reward was offered, Jack, Pepper and Andy  received an invitation to take dinner at Point View Lodge with the Fords  and spend the evening there. The weather was now growing colder and the  Fords expected before long to close up their summer home and move to the  city for the winter.    \"Say, this is all to the merry!\" cried Pepper, as he read the  invitation. \"Of course we'll go.\"    \"If Captain Putnam will let us,\" added Andy, anxiously.    \"I think he will,\" returned Jack. \"He is so cut up over this watch  affair I think he will do almost anything for me.\"    The three went to the captain and showed the invitation, and were told  that they could go to Point View Lodge, but that they must be back at  Putnam Hall by ten o'clock.    \"It's lucky we can go in our uniforms,\" said Pepper. \"Otherwise I  suppose we'd have to go in full dress, eh?\"    \"Sure thing.\"    \"How are we going to get to the Lodge? We can't walk.\"    \"Might hire a carriage for once.\"    \"Too slow. The Lodge is so far off. We could make better time on our  bicycles.\"    \"But if it rains--or snows?\"    \"Then we'll have to take a carriage.\"    The three cadets watched the weather anxiously. It remained clear and  cool up to the afternoon of the day"]]]
