To Him also belong such names as lay hid within  Thy stainless tabernacles, in Thine invisible world and Thy sanctified  cities.    Magnify Thou, moreover, such as have believed in Him and in His signs and  have turned towards Him, from among those that have acknowledged Thy unity  in His Latter Manifestation--a Manifestation whereof He hath made mention  in His Tablets, and in His Books, and in His Scriptures, and in all the  wondrous verses and gem-like utterances that have descended upon Him. It  is this same Manifestation Whose covenant Thou hast bidden Him establish  ere He had established His own covenant. He it is Whose praise the Bayan  hath celebrated. In it His excellence hath been extolled, and His truth  established, and His sovereignty proclaimed, and His Cause perfected.  Blessed is the man that hath turned unto Him, and fulfilled the things He  hath commanded, O Thou Who art the Lord of the worlds and the Desire of  all them that have known Thee!    Praised be Thou, O my God, inasmuch as Thou hast aided us to recognize and  love Him. I, therefore, beseech Thee by Him and by Them Who are the  Day-Springs of Thy Divinity, and the Manifestations of Thy Lordship, and  the Treasuries of Thy Revelation, and the Depositories of Thine  inspiration, to enable us to serve and obey Him, and to empower us to  become the helpers of His Cause and the dispersers of His adversaries.  Powerful art Thou to do all that pleaseth Thee. No God is there beside  Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the One Whose help is sought by all  men!            LVII: \"GOD TESTIFIETH TO THE UNITY OF HIS GODHOOD AND TO...\"      God testifieth to the unity of His Godhood and to the singleness of His  own Being. On the throne of eternity, from the inaccessible heights of His  station, His tongue proclaimeth that there is none other God but Him. He  Himself, independently of all else, hath ever been a witness unto His own  oneness, the revealer of His own nature, the glorifier of His own essence.  He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the Beauteous.    He is supreme over His servants, and standeth over His creatures. In His  hand is the source of authority and truth. He maketh men alive by His  signs, and causeth them to die through His wrath. He shall not be asked of  His doings and His might is equal unto all things. He is the Potent, the  All-Subduing. He holdeth within His grasp the empire of all things, and on  His right hand is fixed the Kingdom of His Revelation. His power, verily,  embraceth the whole of creation. Victory and overlordship are His; all  might and dominion are His; all glory and greatness are His. He, of a  truth, is the All-Glorious, the Most Powerful, the Unconditioned.            LVIII: \"PRAISE BE TO THEE, TO WHOM THE TONGUES OF ALL...\"      Praise be to Thee, to Whom the tongues of all created things have, from  eternity, called, and yet failed to attain the heaven of Thine eternal  holiness and grandeur. The eyes of all beings have been opened to behold  the beauty of Thy radiant countenance, yet none hath succeeded in gazing  on the brightness of the light of Thy face. The hands of them that are  nigh unto Thee have, ever since the foundation of Thy glorious sovereignty  and the establishment of Thy holy dominion, been raised suppliantly  towards Thee, yet no one hath been able to touch the hem of the robe that  clotheth Thy Divine and sovereign Essence. And yet none can deny that Thou  hast ever been, through the wonders of Thy generosity and bounty, supreme  over all things, art powerful to do all things, and art nearer unto all  things than they are unto themselves.    Far be it, then, from Thy glory that anyone should gaze on Thy wondrous  beauty with any eye save Thine own eye, or hear the melodies proclaiming  Thine almighty sovereignty with any ear except Thine own ear. Too high art  Thou exalted for the eye of any creature to behold Thy beauty, or for the  understanding of any heart to scale the heights of Thine immeasurable  knowledge. For should the birds of the hearts of them that are nigh unto  Thee be ever enabled to soar as long as Thine own overpowering sovereignty  can endure, or to ascend as long as the empire of Thy Divine holiness can  last, they shall, in no wise, be able to transcend the limitations which a  contingent world hath imposed upon them, nor pass beyond its confines.  How, then, can he whose very creation is restricted by such limitations,  attain unto Him Who is the Lord of the Kingdom of all created things, or  ascend into the heaven of Him Who ruleth the realms of loftiness and  grandeur?    Glorified, immeasurably glorified art Thou, my Best-Beloved! Inasmuch as  Thou hast ordained that the utmost limit to which they who lift their  hearts to Thee can rise is the confession of their powerlessness to enter  the realms of Thy holy and transcendent unity, and that the highest  station which they who aspire to know Thee can reach is the acknowledgment  of their impotence to attain the retreats of Thy sublime knowledge I,  therefore, beseech Thee, by this very powerlessness which is beloved of  Thee, and which Thou hast decreed as the goal of them that have reached  and attained Thy court, and by the splendors of Thy countenance that have  encompassed all things, and by the energies of Thy Will whereby the entire  creation hath been generated, not to deprive them that have set their  hopes in Thee of the wonders of Thy mercy, nor to withhold from such as  have sought Thee the treasures of Thy grace. Ignite, then, within their  hearts the torch of Thy love, that its flame may consume all else except  their wondrous remembrance of Thee, and that no trace may be left in those  hearts except the gem-like evidences of Thy most holy sovereignty, so that  from the land wherein they dwell no voice may be heard except the voice  that extolleth Thy mercifulness and might, that on the earth on which they  walk no light may shine except the light of Thy beauty, and that within  every soul naught may be discovered except the revelation of Thy  countenance and the tokens of Thy glory, that haply Thy servants may show  forth only that which shall please Thee and shall conform wholly unto Thy  most potent will.    Glory be to Thee, O my God! The power of Thy might beareth me witness! I  can have no doubt that should the holy breaths of Thy loving-kindness and  the breeze of Thy bountiful favor cease, for less than the twinkling of an  eye, to breathe over all created things, the entire creation would perish,  and all that are in heaven and on earth would be reduced to utter  nothingness. Magnified, therefore, be the marvelous evidences of Thy  transcendent power! Magnified be the potency of Thine exalted might!  Magnified be the majesty of Thine all-encompassing greatness, and the  energizing influence of Thy will! Such is Thy greatness that wert Thou to  concentrate the eyes of all men in the eye of one of Thy servants, and to  compress all their hearts within his heart, and wert Thou to enable him to  behold within himself all the things Thou hast created through Thy power  and fashioned through Thy might, and were he to ponder, throughout  eternity, over the realms of Thy creation and the range of Thy handiwork,  he would unfailingly discover that there is no created thing but is  overshadowed by Thine all-conquering power, and is vitalized through Thine  all-embracing sovereignty.    Behold me, then, O my God, fallen prostrate upon the dust before Thee,  confessing my powerlessness and Thine omnipotence, my poverty and Thy  wealth, mine evanescence and Thine eternity, mine utter abasement and  Thine infinite glory. I recognize that there is none other God but Thee,  that Thou hast no peer nor partner, none to equal or rival Thee. In Thine  unapproachable loftiness Thou hast, from eternity, been exalted above the  praise of any one but Thee, and shalt continue for ever, in Thy  transcendent singleness and glory, to be sanctified from the glorification  of any one except Thine own Self.    I swear by Thy might, O my Beloved! To make mention of any created thing  beseemeth not Thy most exalted Self, and to bestow any praise upon any one  of Thy creatures would be wholly unworthy of Thy great glory. Nay, such a  mention would be but blasphemy uttered within the court of Thy holiness,  and such praise would amount to no less than a transgression in the face  of the evidences of Thy Divine sovereignty. For the mere mention of any  one of Thy creatures would in itself imply an assertion of their existence  before the court of Thy singleness and unity. Such an assertion would be  naught but open blasphemy, an act of impiety, the essence of profanity and  a wanton crime.    Wherefore, I bear witness with my soul, my spirit, my entire being, that  should They Who are the Day-Springs of Thy most holy unity and the  Manifestations of Thy transcendent oneness be able to soar so long as  Thine own sovereignty endureth and Thine all-compelling authority can  last, they will fail in the end to attain unto even the precincts of the  court wherein Thou didst reveal the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16985"],[0,"The Proclamation of Bahá'u'lláh (#13)"],[1,"nd.    Know ye from what heights your Lord, the All-Glorious is calling? Think ye  that ye have recognized the Pen wherewith your Lord, the Lord of all  names, commandeth you? Nay, by My life! Did ye but know it, ye would  renounce the world, and would hasten with your whole hearts to the  presence of the Well-Beloved. Your spirits would be so transported by His  Word as to throw into commotion the Greater World--how much more this small  and petty one! Thus have the showers of My bounty been poured down from  the heaven of My loving-kindness, as a token of My grace; that ye may be  of the thankful....    Beware lest the desires of the flesh and of a corrupt inclination provoke  divisions among you. Be ye as the fingers of one hand, the members of one  body. Thus counselleth you the Pen of Revelation, if ye be of them that  believe.    Consider the mercy of God and His gifts. He enjoineth upon you that which  shall profit you, though He Himself can well dispense with all creatures.  Your evil doings can never harm Us, neither can your good works profit Us.  We summon you wholly for the sake of God. To this every man of  understanding and insight will testify.          \"THE world's equilibrium hath been upset through the...\"      THE world's equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating influence of  this most great, this new World Order. Mankind's ordered life hath been  revolutionized through the agency of this unique, this wondrous System--the  like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed.    Immerse yourselves in the ocean of My words, that ye may unravel its  secrets, and discover all the pearls of wisdom that lie hid in its depths.  Take heed that ye do not vacillate in your determination to embrace the  truth of this Cause--a Cause through which the potentialities of the might  of God have been revealed, and His sovereignty established. With faces  beaming with joy, hasten ye unto Him. This is the changeless Faith of God,  eternal in the past, eternal in the future. Let him that seeketh, attain  it; and as to him that hath refused to seek it--verily, God is  Self-Sufficient, above any need of His creatures.    Say: This is the infallible Balance which the Hand of God is holding, in  which all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth are weighed,  and their fate determined, if ye be of them that believe and recognize  this truth. Say: Through it the poor have been enriched, the learned  enlightened, and the seekers enabled to ascend unto the presence of God.  Beware, lest ye make it a cause of dissension amongst you. Be ye as firmly  settled as the immovable mountain in the Cause of your Lord, the Mighty,  the Loving.          \"O YE peoples of the world! Know assuredly that My...\"      O YE peoples of the world! Know assuredly that My commandments are the  lamps of My loving providence among My servants, and the keys of My mercy  for My creatures. Thus hath it been sent down from the heaven of the Will  of your Lord, the Lord of Revelation. Were any man to taste the sweetness  of the words which the lips of the All-Merciful have willed to utter, he  would, though the treasures of the earth be in his possession, renounce  them one and all, that he might vindicate the truth of even one of His  commandments, shining above the Dayspring of His bountiful care and  loving-kindness.    From My laws the sweet smelling savour of My garment can be smelled, and  by their aid the standards of victory will be planted upon the highest  peaks. The Tongue of My power hath, from the heaven of My omnipotent  glory, addressed to My creation these words: 'Observe My commandments, for  the love of My beauty.' Happy is the lover that hath inhaled the divine  fragrance of his Best-Beloved from these words, laden with the perfume of  a grace which no tongue can describe. By My life! He who hath drunk the  choice wine of fairness from the hands of My bountiful favour, will circle  around My commandments that shine above the Dayspring of My creation.    Think not that We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. Nay, rather,  We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers of might and power. To  this beareth witness that which the Pen of Revelation hath revealed.  Meditate upon this, O men of insight!...    Whenever My laws appear like the sun in the heaven of Mine utterance, they  must be faithfully obeyed by all, though My decree be such as to cause the  heaven of every religion to be cleft asunder. He doth what He pleaseth. He  chooseth; and none may question His choice. Whatsoever He, the  Well-Beloved, ordaineth, the same is, verily, beloved. To this He Who is  the Lord of all creation beareth Me witness. Whoso hath inhaled the sweet  fragrance of the All-Merciful, and recognized the Source of this  utterance, will welcome with his own eyes the shafts of the enemy, that he  may establish the truth of the laws of God amongst men. Well is it with  him that hath turned thereunto, and apprehended the meaning of His  decisive decree.          \"THIS is the Day in which God's most excellent favours...\"      THIS is the Day in which God's most excellent favours have been poured out  upon men, the Day in which His most mighty grace hath been infused into  all created things. It is incumbent upon all the peoples of the world to  reconcile their differences, and, with perfect unity and peace, abide  beneath the shadow of the Tree of His care and loving-kindness. It  behoveth them to cleave to whatsoever will, in this Day, be conducive to  the exaltation of their stations, and to the promotion of their best  interests. Happy are those whom the all-glorious Pen was moved to  remember, and blessed are those men whose names, by virtue of Our  inscrutable decree, We have preferred to conceal.    Beseech ye the one true God to grant that all men may be graciously  assisted to fulfil that which is acceptable in Our sight. Soon will the  present-day order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead.  Verily, thy Lord speaketh the truth, and is the Knower of things unseen."]]]
