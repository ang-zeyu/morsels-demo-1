The quantity of tatting or crochet cotton used by an average worker is  found to be two yards to the square inch with a single shuttle; three  yards to the square inch with two shuttles.           *       *       *       *       *          EMBROIDERY      INSTRUCTIONS.      The art of embroidering with cotton on linen, muslin, cambric, pique,  &c., is very easy to learn by strictly attending to the following  instructions.    The size of the thread and needle must correspond to that of the  material on which you embroider; the needle must not be too long, and  the cotton must be soft. Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s embroidery  cotton is the best. Skilful embroiderers never work over anything,  because when you tack the material on paper or cloth each stitch shows,  and if the material is very fine, leaves small holes; but for those that  are learning we should advise them to tack the material to be  embroidered upon a piece of _toile ciree_. If you work without this,  place the material straight over the forefinger of the left hand; the  material must never be held slantways. The three other fingers of the  left hand hold the work; the thumb remains free to give the right  position to each stitch. The work must always, if possible, lie so that  the outline of the pattern is turned towards the person who works. For  the sake of greater clearness one part of the following illustrations is  given in larger size than nature. Preparing the patterns is one of the  most important things in embroidery, for the shape of the patterns is  often spoiled merely because they have not been prepared with sufficient  care.      [Illustration: 66.--Scallop.]    ILLUSTRATION 66 shows how to prepare a scallop. Take thicker cotton than  that with which you work; never commence with a knot, and do not take a  thread longer than sixteen or eighteen inches. The outlines of the  scallops are first traced with short straight stitches. In the corners  particularly the stitches must be short. The space between the outlines  is filled with chain stitches, as can be seen from illustration; they  must not be too long, otherwise the embroidery will look coarse. It is  in this way that every pattern to be worked in button-hole or satin  stitch is to be prepared.      [Illustration: 67.--Double Overcast Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATION 67 shows the double overcast stitch or button-hole stitch  in a straight line. After having traced the outline begin to work from  left to right; fasten the cotton with a few stitches, hold it with the  thumb of the left hand under the outline, insert the needle downwards  above the outline, draw it out under the same above the cotton which you  hold in the left hand, and draw it up. Repeat for all the stitches in  the same manner; they must be regular and lie close to one another.  Great care should be taken that the material on which you embroider is  not puckered.      [Illustration: 68.--Overcast Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATION 68 (_Overcast Stitch_).--The double overcast and the  button-hole stitches are worked from left to right, whilst back  stitches, knotted and satin stitches are worked from right to left. The  stitch is worked in the same way as the double overcast, only the needle  must never be drawn out _above_, but _below_, the cotton with which you  work, and which you keep down with the thumb of the left hand.      [Illustration: 69.--Slanting Overcast Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATION 69.--The slanting overcast stitch is worked without tracing  the outline, always inserting the needle downwards--that is, from top to  bottom. The needle must be inserted in the manner shown in  illustration--that is, not straight, but slanting; insert it a little  farther than the last stitch, and draw it out close to it. The wrong  side of the work must show back stitches. This sort of stitch is used  for the fine outlines in patterns or letter.      [Illustration: 70.--Back Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATION 70.--This shows the back stitch, the working of which is  well known; it is worked in several rows close to each other.      [Illustration: 71.--Point Croise.]    [Illustration: 72.--Point Croise.]    ILLUSTRATIONS 71 & 72 show another kind of back stitch, called _point  croise_, which is only used on very thin and transparent materials. This  stitch forms on the wrong side a sort of darned pattern, which is seen  by transparence on the right side, and gives the embroidered pattern a  thicker appearance, contrasting with the rest of the work (see the lower  leaves of the flower on illustration 110). For this stitch insert the  needle into the material as for the common back stitch, draw it out  underneath the needle on the opposite outline of the pattern, so as to  form on the wrong side a slanting line. Insert the needle again as for  common back stitch; draw it out slanting at the place marked for the  next stitch on the opposite outline, as shown in illustration 71.      [Illustration: 73--- Knotted Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATION 73 shows the knotted stitch; the simplest way of working it  is to work two back stitches at a short distance from each other over  the same thread.      The knotted stitch seen in ILLUSTRATION 74 is worked thus:--Take about  four threads of the material on the needle, draw the needle half out,  wind the cotton twice round the point of the needle, hold it tight with  the thumb, draw the needle out carefully and insert it at the place  where the stitch was begun, and draw it out at the place where the next  stitch is to be worked.    [Illustration: 74.--Knotted Stitch.]      [Illustration: 75.--Knotted Stitch]    The knotted stitch seen on ILLUSTRATION 75 is worked in nearly the same  manner as the preceding one. Before drawing the cotton out of the  material hold it tight with the left-hand thumb; leave the needle in the  same position, wind the cotton twice round it, turn the needle from left  to right, so (follow the direction of the arrow) that its point arrives  where the cotton was drawn out (marked by a cross in illustration),  insert the needle there, and draw it out at the place of the next  stitch.      ILLUSTRATIONS 76 & 77.--Raised satin stitch is principally used for  blossoms, flowers, leaves, letters, &c. After having traced the outlines  of the pattern, fill the space left between them with chain stitches in  a direction different from that in which the pattern is to be  embroidered; begin at the point of the leaf, working from right to left,  make short straight stitches, always    [Illustration: 76.--Raised Satin Stitch.]    inserting the needle close above the outline and drawing it out below.  The leaves on the flowers, as well as on the branches, must be begun  from the point, because they thus acquire a better shape. If you wish to  work a leaf divided in the middle, as seen in illustration 77, you must  trace the veining before you fill it with chain stitches, then begin at  one point of the leaf and work first one half and then the other.    [Illustration: 77.--Raised Satin Stitch.]      [Illustration: 78.--Point de Plume.]    ILLUSTRATION 78 shows the so-called _point de plume_ on a scalloped  leaf. It is worked like the satin stitch, only the needle is drawn  through the material in a slanting direction.      [Illustration: 79.--Point de Minute.]    ILLUSTRATION 79 (_Point de Minute_).--This stitch is often used instead  of satin stitch when the patterns must appear raised. Wind the cotton  several times round the point of the needle, which is inserted into the  material half its length (the number of times the cotton is to be wound  round the needle depends on the length of the pattern), hold fast the  windings with the thumb of the left hand, draw the needle and the cotton  through the windings, insert the needle into the material at the same  place, and draw it out at the place where the next stitch is to begin.      [Illustration: 80.--Ladder Stitch.]    [Illustration: 81.--Ladder Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATIONS 80 & 81 show the _ladder stitch_, often used in ornamental  embroidery. Trace first the outlines as seen in illustrations; mark also  the cross stitches between the outlines, so that the first touch the  outlines only at both ends. The outlines are embroidered in overcast  stitch or double overcast; the material is cut away underneath the  ladder stitch between the outlines.    We have now shown the different kinds of stitches used in embroidery;  the following illustrations show them used for different patterns.      [Illustration: 82.--Button-hole Stitch Scallop.]    [Illustration: 83.--Button-hole Stitch Scallop.]    [Illustration: 84.--Button-hole Stitch Scallop.]    [Illustration: 85.--Button-hole Stitch Scallop.]    ILLUSTRATIONS 82 TO 85 (_Different Button-hole Stitch Scallops_).--These  scallops are prepared as above described. Take care to have the stitches  even and regular; the scallops must be wide in the centre and very fine  at both ends.      ILLUSTRATIONS 86 & 87 (_Button-holes and Eyelets_).--This kind of  embroidery is used only in round or long patterns. Trace first the  outline of the hole, cut away a small round piece of material, not too  close to the outlines (when the button-hole is very small merely insert  the point of the scissors or a stiletto into the material), fold the  edge of the material back with the needle, and work the hole in overcast  stitch, inserting the needle into the empty place in the centre and  drawing it out under the outline. Some button-holes are worked  separately; sometimes they are in a row; if so, take care to begin to  work each button-hole at the place where it touches the next. In the  following button-holes the outside must be traced double, so as to reach  as far as the next one, but each button-hole is finished at once.  Illustration 86 "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15154"],[0,"Psychology and Industrial Efficiency (#13)"],[1," processes are  necessary in the typical case, and even then it is presupposed that  the telephone girl understood the exchange and number correctly. It is  a common experience of the companies that these demands cannot be  satisfactorily fulfilled when a telephone girl has to handle more than  225 calls in an hour. The official statistics show that this figure is  exceeded in not infrequent cases,[13] in extreme cases the number may  even rise beyond 300. Moreover, in short periods of reinforced demands  it may happen that for a few minutes even the rapidity of 10 calls in  a minute is reached. Normally the burden is divided among the  employees in such a way that about 150 calls fall to each one in an  hour, and that this figure is passed considerably only in one morning  and one evening hour. A skillful distribution of pauses and ample  arrangements for rest, usually together with very excellent hygienic  conditions, make it possible for the fit persons to be able to carry  on this work without over-fatigue from 8 to 9 hours a day. On the  other hand, it is only natural that such rapid and yet subtle activity  under such high tension, where especially the quick localization of  the correct hole is a difficult and yet indispensable part, can be  carried out only by a relatively small number of human nervous  systems. The inability to keep attention at such a high point for a  long while, or to perform such rapid movements, or to retain the  numbers correctly, does not lead to fatal accidents like those in the  case of the unfit motormen, but it does lead to fatigue and finally to  a nervous breakdown of the employees and to confusion in the service.  The result is that the company is continually obliged to dismiss a  considerable proportion of those who have entered the service and who  have spent some months in going through the training school of the  company. As one single company, the Bell Telephone Company, employs  16,000 operators, the problem is an expansive one, and it has bearing  on the health of the employees as well as on the patience of the  subscribers. But above all it refers to the economic interests of the  company, inasmuch as every girl who satisfies the entrance conditions  of hearing and sight, of school education and general personal  appearance, receives some salary throughout the months of training in  the telephone school. Since during the first half-year, in which the  employee still works entirely under supervision, more than a third of  those who had originally entered leave, partly on account of  unfitness, and inability, partly on account of over-fatigue or similar  reasons, the economic disadvantage to the company is evidently a very  great one. The candidates are paid for months of mere training, and  they themselves waste their energy and time with practice in a kind of  labor which cannot be serviceable to them in any other economic  activity. Under these circumstances it is not surprising that one  city system approached me with the question whether it would not  interest me from a scientific point of view to examine how far the  mental fitness of the employees could be determined beforehand through  experimental means.    After carefully observing the service in the central office for a  while, I came to the conviction that it would not be appropriate here  to reproduce the activity at the switchboard in the experiment, but  that it would be more desirable to resolve that whole function into  its elements and to undertake the experimental test of a whole series  of elementary mental dispositions. Every one of these mental acts can  then be examined according to well-known laboratory methods without  giving to the experiments any direct relation to the characteristic  telephone operation as such. I carried on the first series of  experiments with about thirty young women who a short time before had  entered into the telephone training school, where they are admitted  only at the age between seventeen and twenty-three years. I examined  them with reference to eight different psychophysical functions. In  saying this, I abstract from all those measurements and tests which  had somewhat anthropometric character, such as the measurement of the  length of the fingers, the rapidity of breathing, the rapidity of  pulse, the acuity of vision and of hearing, the distinctness of the  pronunciation, and so on. A part of the psychological tests were  carried on in individual examinations, but the greater part with the  whole class together.    These common tests referred to memory, attention, intelligence,  exactitude, and rapidity. I may characterize the experiments in a few  words. The memory examination consisted of reading to the whole class  at first two numbers of 4 digits, then two of 5 digits, then two of 6  digits, and so on up to figures of 12 digits, and demanding that they  be written down as soon as a signal was given. The experiments on  attention, which in this case of the telephone operators seemed to me  especially significant, made use of a method the principle of which  has frequently been applied in the experimental psychology of  individual differences and which I adjusted to our special needs. The  requirement is to cross out a particular letter in a connected text.  Every one of the thirty women in the classroom received the same first  page of a newspaper of that morning. I emphasize that it was a new  paper, as the newness of the content was to secure the desired  distraction of the attention. As soon as the signal was given, each  one of the girls had to cross out with a pencil every \"a\" in the text  for six minutes. After a certain time, a bell signal was given and  each then had to begin a new column. In this way we could find out,  first, how many letters were correctly crossed out in those six  minutes, secondly, how many letters were overlooked, and, thirdly, how  the recognition and the oversight were distributed in the various  parts of the text. In every one of these three directions strong  individual differences were indeed noticeable. Some persons crossed  out many, but also overlooked many, others overlooked hardly any of  the \"a's,\" but proceeded very slowly so that the total number of the  crossed-out letters was small. Moreover, it was found that some at  first do poor work, but soon reach a point at which their attention  remains on a high level; others begin with a relatively high  achievement, but after a short time their attention flags, and the  number of crossed-out letters becomes smaller or the number of  unnoticed, overlooked letters increases. Fluctuations of attention,  deficiencies, and strong points can be discovered in much detail.    The third test which was tried with the whole class referred to the  intelligence of the individuals. Discussion of the question how to  test intelligence in general would quickly lead us into as yet  unsettled controversies. It is a chapter of the psychology of tests  which, especially in the service of pedagogy but to a certain degree  also in the service of medicine, has been more carefully elaborated  than any other. Often it has been contested whether we have any right  to speak of one general central intelligence factor, and whether this  apparently unified activity ought not to be resolved into a series of  mere elementary processes. The newer pedagogical investigations,  however, speak in favor of the view that besides all special  processes, or rather, above all of them, an ability must be recognized  which cannot be divided any further, and by which the individual  adjusts his knowledge, his experiences, and his dispositions to the  changing purposes of life. The grading of the pupils in a class  usually expresses this differentiation of the intelligence; and while  the differences of industry or of mere memory and similar secondary  features may sometimes interfere, it remains after all not difficult  for an observant teacher to grade the pupils of his class, whom he  knows well, according to their general intelligence. The psychological  experiments carried on in the schoolroom have demonstrated that this  ability can be tested by the measurement of some very simple mental  activities. The best method would be the one which would allow the  experimenter, on the basis of a single experiment, to grade the  individuals in the same order in which they appear in the record of  the teacher. Among the various proposed schemes for this purpose the  figures suggest that the most reliable one is the following method,  the results of which show the highest agreement between the rank order  based on the experiments and the rank order of the teachers.[14] The  experiment consists in reading to the pupils a long series of pairs of  words of which the two members of the pair always logically belong  together. Later, one word of each pair will be read to them and they  have to write down the word which belonged with it in the pair. This  is not a simple experiment on memory. The tests have shown that if  instead of logically connected words simply disconnected chance words  are offered and reproduced, no one can keep such a long series of  pairs in mind, while with the words which have related meaning, the  most intelligent pupils can master the whole series. The very  favorable results which this method had yielded in the classroom made  me decide to try it in this case too. I chose for an experiment 24  pairs of words from the sphere of experience of the girls to be  tested. Two further class experiments belonged rather to the periphery  of psychology. The exactitude of space-perception was measured by  demanding that each divide first the long and then the short edge of a  folio sheet into two equal halves by a pencil mark. And finally, to  measure the rapidity of movement, it was demanded that every one make  with a pencil on the paper zigzag movements of a particular size  during the ten seconds"]]]
