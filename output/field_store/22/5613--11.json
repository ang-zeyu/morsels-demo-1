It is usually found  inclosed within very hard stones; sometimes growing on their outside,  and sometimes detached from them.         _Fibrous_, full of fibres or threads.      What are its qualities?    It is insipid; will not dissolve in water; and exposed to the fire, it  neither consumes nor calcines. The industry of mankind has found a  method of working upon this untoward mineral and employing it in  making cloth and paper; the process is, however, difficult.         _Insipid_, without taste.      Was not this curious mineral better known to the ancients than it is  at present?    The linen made from it was highly esteemed by them; it was not only  better known, but more common, than among us, being equally valuable  with the richest pearls; but the superiority of all other cloths to  this in every respect, except the resistance to fire, has caused  incombustible cloth to be regarded in modern times merely as a  curiosity, but it is still employed in chemical preparations.         _Incombustible_, remaining undestroyed in fire.      To what use did they put it?    In royal funerals, it formed the shroud to wrap the body in that its  ashes might be prevented from mingling with the wood, &c., that  composed the pile. Some of the ancients made themselves clothes of it,  particularly the Brahmins among the Hindoos; it formed wicks for their  perpetual lamps; thread, ropes, nets, and paper were also made of it.  Pliny, the Roman naturalist, says he has seen napkins of asbestus  taken soiled from the table after a feast, which were thrown into the  fire, and by that means better scoured than if they had been washed  with water.         _Naturalist_, a person who studies nature, especially in       what relates to minerals, vegetables, and animals.         _Brahmins_, Hindoo priests.      Where is the Asbestus found?    This mineral is found in the greatest quantity in the silver mines of  Saxony; at Bleyburg, in Carinthia; in Sweden, Corsica, and sometimes  in France, England, and the United States; also in Tartary and  Siberia.      What method is used in preparing the Asbestus?    The stone is laid in warm water to soak, then opened and divided by  the hands, that the earthy matter may be washed out. This washing is  several times repeated, and the flax-like filaments collected and  dried; these are easily spun with the addition of flax. The cloth when  woven is best preserved by oil from breaking or wasting; on exposure  to the fire, the flax and the oil burn out, and the cloth remains of a  pure white. The shorter threads, which separate on washing the stone,  may be made into paper in the usual manner.      What is Salt?    A saline crystallization of a sharp, pungent taste, and cleansing  quality, used to season flesh, fish, butter, &c., and other things  that are to be kept. It is distinguished, with reference to the  general sources from which it is most plentifully derived, into three  different sorts, namely, fossil, or rock salt; sea, or marine salt;  and spring salt, or that drawn from briny springs and wells.         _Marine_, belonging to the sea.         _Saline_, consisting of salt.         _Briny_, consisting of brine; which means water tasting of       salt; it is used to signify the waters of the sea, or any       salt water.      What is Fossil or Rock Salt?    That which is found in large beds in the bowels of the earth, and  which has not undergone any artificial preparation; it is sometimes  colorless, but more frequently red, yellow, or blue, and mixed with  earthy impurities; this salt was entirely unknown to the ancients, who  by rock salt meant that which adheres to the rocks above high-water  mark, being lodged there by the spray of the sea, which is evaporated  by the heat of the sun; this is the purest salt, and is to be found on  the rocks of Sicily, and several islands of the West Indies.         _Artificial_, produced by art, and the labor of man.         _Evaporated_, converted into vapor and dissipated.      What is Marine Salt?    That which is made from sea-water, concentrated by repeated  evaporations, and at length crystallized.      What is Spring Salt?    That salt which is not made from sea-water, but from the water of salt  wells or springs; large quantities of this salt are made in the United  States, in some parts of which saline springs are numerous.      In what manner is it obtained?    The means employed for extracting the salt from the water vary  according to circumstances. In hot countries, the water is merely  exposed to the action of the sun, until the water is evaporated; the  salt procured in this manner is considered the best.      What method is usually employed in countries where the sun's heat is  not sufficiently powerful?    In climates where the rays of the sun do not afford sufficient heat,  the water, which has been partly evaporated in large shallow  reservoirs formed in the earth, called salt-pans, is poured into  enormous coppers and boiled for four or five hours: when the contents  of the copper are wasted to half the quantity, the liquid begins to be  crystallized; the vessel is again filled up, and the brine again  boiled and purified: this is repeated three or four times. After the  last purifying the fire is kept very low for twelve or fourteen hours,  and when the moisture is nearly evaporated the salt is removed, and,  after the remaining brine has drained off, is placed in the  store-houses.      In what countries is Salt generally found?    This substance, so necessary to the comfort of mankind, is widely  distributed over the face of the earth, and nothing, except, perhaps,  the air we breathe, is more easily placed within our reach. The ocean  is an exhaustless store-house of this valuable article. Those nations  of the earth which are placed at a distance from the sea, find  themselves provided with magazines of salt, either in solid masses, or  dissolved in the waters of inland lakes, or issuing from the solid  rocks in springs of brine. At Salina, Syracuse, and other places in  Onondaga Co., New York, salt springs are remarkably abundant, and  yield annually several millions of bushels; immense quantities are  also obtained from the salt-wells on the Great and Little Kanawha, and  other places in Western Virginia; it is also extensively manufactured  in the western part of Pennsylvania, and throughout the Western  States.      Name the countries most noted for mines of Salt.    Poland, Upper Hungary, and the mountains of Catalonia, have extensive  salt mines; those in the village of Wieliczca, in Poland, about five  leagues from Cracow, are of a surprising depth and size. In the  interior of Hindostan, there is a remarkable salt lake; and in several  parts of the globe there are spots of ground impregnated entirely with  this substance: an island of the East Indies contains a singular kind  of fossil, or native dry salt; the soil there is in general very  fruitful, but in certain parts of the island, there are spots of  ground entirely barren, without the appearance of anything vegetable  upon them; these spots taste very much of salt, and abound with it in  such quantities, as to supply not only the whole island, but the  greater part of the adjacent continent. In Utah Territory, especially  in the neighborhood of the Mormon city, at the Great Salt Lake, are  found extensive plains thus impregnated with salt, which is procured  in great abundance.         _Fossil_, the remains of minerals or shells dug from the       earth.         _Impregnated_, filled, saturated.         _Catalonia_, a considerable province of Spain, situated to       the north-east.         _Adjacent_, adjoining, lying near, or contiguous.      To what use did the ancient inhabitants of Africa and Arabia put this  substance?    The large slabs of rock salt, with which their country abounds, were  employed by them instead of stones, in building their dwellings, the  pieces being easily cemented together by sprinkling the joints with  water, which, melting the parts of the two surfaces that opposed each  other, formed the whole, when dry, into one solid block.      Does Rock Salt undergo any preparation before it is used?    Yes; when taken from the earth it is dissolved in cold water, and  afterwards drawn off into salt-pans, and refined in the same manner as  the sea salt.      What is Coal?    A hard, black, sulphurous and inflammable substance, dug out of the  earth, serving in many countries as fuel. It is common in most of the  countries of Europe and America. In some parts of the United States,  it is found in beds having an area of several thousand square miles.      From what is Coal supposed to have originated?    Its origin is supposed to be derived from gigantic trees which  flourished in the swamps and forests of the primeval earth. These  having been torn away from their native bed, by storms and  inundations, were transported into some adjacent lake, river, or sea.  Here they floated on the waters until, saturated with them, they sank  to the bottom, and being buried in the lower soil of adjacent lands,  became transformed into a new state among the members of the mineral  kingdom. A long interment followed, during which a course of chemical  changes, and new combinations of their vegetable elements, converted  them to the mineral condition of coal.         _Primeval_, original, existing before the flood.         _Gigantic_, extremely large, greater than the usual size.         _Interment_, burial under the ground.         _Elements_, the several parts or principles of which bodies       are composed.      What is a Coal Mine?    A subterraneous excavation, from which coal is obtained.      Do the terms Coal and Charcoal signify the same substance?    No; Charcoal is an artificial fuel, made in imitation of coal, by  burning wood covered with earth so as partially to exclude the air. It  is used for various purposes, as the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16737"],[0,"International Language, Past, Present & Future (#13)"],[1,"n.    (7) It is doomed to failure--look at Volapük!    (8) There are quite enough languages already.    (9) You have to learn three or four languages in order to understand  Esperanto.    (10) You cannot know it without learning it.    (11) You have to wear a green star.    Pains have been taken to make this list exhaustive. If any reader can  think of another objection, he is requested to communicate with the  author.    Most of the serious arguments have been already dealt with, so that not  many words need be said here. As regards No. VII. (Technical), this is  not the place to deal with actual criticisms of the language (Esperanto)  that holds the field. The reader will not be in a position to judge of  them till he has learnt it. Suffice it to say that they can all be met,  and some of the points criticised as vices are, in reality, virtues in  an artificial language.    As for Nos. II. and IV. (Sentimental and Literary), most of these  objections are due to the old heresy of the literary man, that an  artificial language claims to compete with natural languages _as a  language_. Once realize that it is primarily a labour-saving device,  and therefore to be judged like any other modern invention such as  telegraphy or shorthand, and most of these objections fall to the  ground.    A good many of the objections cannot be taken seriously (though they  have all been seriously made), or refute themselves or each other. No.  VIII. (10) sounds like a fake, but this was the criticism of a scholar  and linguist who had been persuaded to look at Esperanto. He complained  that though he, knowing Latin, French, Italian, German, and English,  could read it without ever having learnt it, ordinary Englishmen could  not. It is usual to judge an invention by efficiency compared to cost,  but if an appliance is to be condemned because it needs some trouble to  master it, then not many inventions will survive.    No. VIII. (9) is of course a mistake. It is like saying that you must  practice looping the loop or circus-riding in order to keep your balance  on a bicycle. The greater, of course, includes the less; but it is  better in both cases to begin with the less. It is much more reasonable  to reverse the argument and say: If you begin by learning Esperanto,  you will possess a valuable aid towards learning three or four national  languages.    No. VIII. (5) is absurd. It is the hardest thing in the world to  extirpate a national language; and all the forces of organized  repression (e.g. in unhappy Poland) are finding the task too much for  them. What inducement have the common people, who form the bulk of the  population in every land, to substitute in their home intercourse for  their own language one that they have to learn, if at all, artificially  at school? Only those who have much international intercourse will ever  become really at home in international language--i.e. sufficiently at  home to make it possible to use it indifferently as a substitute for  their mother-tongue; and people who engage in prolonged and continuous  international intercourse, though numerous, will always be in a  minority.                                        XVI                 THE WIDER COSMOPOLITANISM--THE COMING OF ASIA    In the civilized West, where pleasure, business, and science are daily  forging new ties of common interests between the nations, those engaged  in such pursuits have clearly much to gain from the simplification of  their pursuits by a common language. But let us look ahead a little  further still. It may well be that the outstanding feature of the  twentieth century in history will be the coming into line of the peoples  of Asia with their pioneer brethren of the West. Look where you will,  everywhere the symptoms are plain for those who can read them. Japan has  led the way. China is following, and will not be far behind; eventually,  as the Japanese themselves foresee, she will probably outstrip Japan, if  not the world. There seems to be no ground, ethnological or otherwise,  for thinking that the lagging behind of Asia in modern civilization  corresponds to a real inferiority of powers, mental or physical, in the  individual Asiatic. Experience shows that under suitable conditions the  Asiatic can efficiently handle all the white man's tools and weapons;  the complete coming up to date is largely a matter of organization,  education, and the possession of a few really able men at the head of  affairs. Given these, progress may be astonishingly quick. Europeans do  not yet seem to have grasped at all adequately the real significance of  the last fifty years of Japanese history. Do they really think that the  Chinaman is inferior to the Japanese? If so, let them ask any residents  in the Far East. Can it be maintained that a generation ago the peasant  of Eastern Europe was ahead of the country Chinaman? But the last few  years have shown how swiftly modern civilization spreads, both in Europe  and America, from the comparatively small group of nations which in the  main have worked it out to the others, till lately considered backward  and semi-barbarous. And this is the case not merely with the material  products of civilization, the railway and the telegraph, but also as  regards its divers manifestations in all that concerns the life of the  people--constitutional government with growth of representative, elected  authorities and democracy; universal education with universal power of  reading and consequent birth of a cheap press; rise of industry and  consequent growth of towns; universal military service and discipline,  now in force in most lands; rise of a moneyed and leisured class and  consequent growth of sport, and of all kinds of clubs and societies for  promoting various interests, social, sporting, political, religious,  educational, philanthropic, and so forth. In fact, the more the material  side of life is \"modernized,\" the more closely do the citizens of all  lands approximate to one another in their interests and activities,  which ultimately rest upon and grow out of their material conditions.  Meantime wealth and consequently foreign travel everywhere increase,  fresh facilities of communication are constantly provided, men from  different countries are more and more thrown together, and all this  makes for the further strengthening of mutual interests and the growth  of fresh ones in common.    Now if (1) under the stress of \"modernization\" life is already becoming  so similar in the lands of the West, and if (2) the Asiatic is not  fundamentally inferior in mental and physical endowments, then it  follows as a certainty that the Asiatic world will, under the same  stress, enter the comity of nations, and approximate to the world-type  of interest and activity. It is only a question of time. In economic  history nothing is more certain than that science, organization,  cheapness, and efficiency must ultimately prevail over sporadic,  unorganized local effort based on tradition and not on scientific  exploitation of natural advantages. Thus the East will adopt the  material civilization of the West; and through the same organization  of industrial and commercial life and generally similar economic  conditions, the same type of moneyed class will grow up, with the same  range of interests on the intellectual and social side, diverse indeed,  but in their very diversity conforming more and more to the world-type.    Concurrently with this new tendency to uniformity proceeds the weakening  of the two most powerful disintegrating influences of primitive  humanity--religion and tradition. In the earlier stages of society  these are the two most powerful agents for binding together into groups  men already associated by the ties of locality and common ancestry,  and fettering them in the cast-iron bonds of custom and ceremonial  observance. While the members of each group are thus held together by  the ideas which appeal most profoundly to unsophisticated mankind, the  various groups are automatically and by the same process held apart by  the full force of those ideas. Thus are produced castes, with their  deadening opposition to all progress; and thus arise crusades, wars of  religion and persecutions. Religion and tradition are then at once the  mightiest integrants within each single community, and the mightiest  disintegrants as between different communities.    But this narrow and dissevering spirit of caste dies back before the  spread of knowledge. The tendency to regard a man as unclean or a  barbarian, simply because he does not believe or behave as one's own  people, is merely a product of isolation and ignorance, and disappears  with education and the general opening up of a country. The inquisitor  can no longer boast of \"strained relations\"--strained physically on the  rack, owing to differences of religious opinion. The state of things  which made it possible for sepoys to revolt because rifle bullets were  greased with the fat of a sacred animal, or for yellow men to tear  up railway tracks because the magic desecrated the tombs of their  ancestors, is rapidly passing away, as Orientals realize the profits to  be made from scientific methods.    Thus the levelling influence is at work, and the checks upon it are  diminishing. The end can be but one. There will be a greater and greater  similarity of life and occupation the world over, and more and more  actual and potential international intercourse.    Now, the further we move in this direction, the greater will be the  impatience of vexatious restraints upon the freedom of intercourse;  and of these restraints the difference of language is one of the most  vexatious, because it is one of the easiest to remove. If we devote  millions of pounds to annihilating the barriers of space, can we not  devote a few months to the comparatively modest effort necessary to  annihilate the barriers of language?    A real cosmopolitanism, "]]]
