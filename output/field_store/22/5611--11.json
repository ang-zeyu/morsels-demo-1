Hubert successfully withstood  this rash proposal, and also Fulk's fatal suggestion that Henry should  divide his army and send two hundred knights for the invasion of  Normandy. Before long the English marched through Brittany to Nantes,  where they wasted six weeks. At last, on the advice of Hubert, they  journeyed south into Poitou. The innate Poitevin instability had again  brought round the Lusignans, the house of Thouars, and their kind to the  French side, and Henry found that his own mother did her best to  obstruct his progress. He was too strong to make open resistance safe,  and his long progress from Nantes to Bordeaux was only once checked by  the need to fight his way. This opposition came from the little town and  castle of Mirambeau, situated in Upper Saintonge, rather more than  half-way between Saintes and Blaye.[1] From July 21 to 30 Mirambeau  stoutly held out, but Henry's army was reinforced by the chivalry of  Gascony, and by a siege-train borrowed from Bordeaux and the loyal lords  of the Garonne. Against such appliances of warfare Mirambeau could not  long resist. On its capitulation Henry pushed on to Bordeaux.        [1] E. Berger, _Bibl. Ecole des Chartes_, 1893, _pp. 35-36_,      shows that Mirambeau, not Mirebeau, was besieged by Henry; see      also his _Blanche de Castille_ (1895).    Useless as the march through Poitou had been, it was then repeated in  the reverse way. With scarcely a week's rest, Henry left the Gascon  capital on August 10, and on September 15 ended his inglorious campaign  at Nantes. Although he was unable to assert himself against the  faithless Poitevins, the barons of the province were equally impotent  to make head against him. On reaching Brittany, Hubert once more  stopped further military efforts. After a few days' rest at Nantes,  Henry made his way by slow stages through the heart of Brittany. It was  said that his army had no better occupation than teaching the local  nobles to drink deep after the English fashion. The King had wasted all  his treasure, and the poorer knights were compelled to sell or pawn  their horses and arms to support themselves. The farce ended when the  King sailed from St. Pol de Leon, and late in October landed at  Portsmouth. He left a portion of his followers in Brittany, under the  Earls of Chester and Pembroke. Randolph himself, as a former husband of  Constance of Brittany, had claims to certain dower lands which  appertained to Count Peter's mother-in-law. He was put in possession of  St. James de Beuvron, and thence he raided Normandy and Anjou. By this  time the coalition against the count of Champagne had broken down, and  Blanche was again triumphant. It was useless to continue a struggle so  expensive and disastrous, and on July 4, 1231, a truce for three years  was concluded between France, Brittany, and England. Peter des Roches,  then returning through France from his crusade, took an active part in  negotiating the treaty. Just as the king was disposed to make the  justiciar the scapegoat of his failure, Hubert's old enemy appeared  once more upon the scene. The responsibility for blundering must be  divided among the English magnates, and not ascribed solely to their  monarch. If Hubert saved Henry from reckless adventures, he certainly  deserves a large share of the blame for the Poitevin fiasco.    The grave situation at home showed the folly of this untimely revival  of an active foreign policy. The same years that saw the collapse of  Henry's hopes in Normandy and Poitou, witnessed troubles both in  Ireland and in Wales. In both these regions the house of the Marshals  was a menace to the neighbouring chieftains, and Hugh de Lacy, Earl of  Ulster, and Llewelyn ap Iorwerth, made common cause against it and  vigorously attacked their rivals both in Leinster and in South Wales.  Nor was this the only disturbance. The summons of the Norman chieftains  of Ireland to Poitou gave the king of Connaught a chance of attacking  the justiciar of Ireland, Geoffrey Marsh, who ultimately drove the  Irish back with severe loss. Llewelyn was again as active and hostile  as ever. Irritated by the growing strength of the new royal castle of  Montgomery, he laid siege to it in 1228. Hubert de Burgh, then  castellan of Montgomery, could only save his castle by summoning the  levies of the kingdom. At their head Hubert went in person to hold the  field against Llewelyn, taking the king with him. The Welsh withdrew as  usual before a regular army, and Hubert and the king, late in  September, marched a few miles westwards of Montgomery to the vale of  Kerry, where they erected a castle. But Llewelyn soon made the English  position in Kerry untenable. Many of the English lords were secretly in  league with him, and the army suffered severely from lack of food. In  the fighting that ensued the Welsh got the better of the English,  taking prisoner William de Braose, the heir of Builth, and one of the  greatest of the marcher lords. At last king and justiciar were glad to  agree to demolish the new castle on receiving from Llewelyn the  expenses involved in the task. The dismantled ruin was called \"Hubert's  folly\". \"And then,\" boasts the Welsh chronicler, \"the king returned to  England with shame.\"    In 1230 Llewelyn inflicted another slight upon his overlord. William de  Braose long remained the Welsh prince's captive, and only purchased his  liberty by agreeing to wed his daughter to Llewelyn's son, and  surrendering Builth as her marriage portion. The captive had employed  his leisure in winning the love of Llewelyn's wife, Joan, Henry's  half-sister. At Easter, Llewelyn took a drastic revenge on the  adulterer. He seized William in his own castle at Builth, and on May 2  hanged him on a tree in open day in the presence of 900 witnesses.  Finding that neither the king nor the marchers moved a finger to avenge  the outrage done to sister and comrade, Llewelyn took the aggressive in  regions which had hitherto been comparatively exempt from his assaults.  In 1231 he laid his heavy hand on all South Wales, burning down  churches full of women, as the English believed, and signalling out for  special attack the marshal's lands in Gwent and Pembroke. Once more the  king penetrated with his barons into Mid Wales, while the pope and  archbishop excommunicated Llewelyn and put his lands under interdict.  Yet neither temporal nor spiritual arms were of avail against the  Welshman. Henry's only exploit in this, his second Welsh campaign, was  to rebuild Maud's Castle in stone. He withdrew, and in December agreed  to conclude a three years' truce, and procure Llewelyn's absolution.  Hubert once more bore the blame of his master's failure.    On July 9, 1228, Stephen Langton died. Despite their differences as to  the execution of the charters, his removal lost the justiciar a  much-needed friend. Affairs were made worse by the unteachable folly of  the monks of Christ Church. Regardless of the severe warning which they  had received in the storms that preceded the establishment of Langton's  authority, the chapter forthwith proceeded to the election of their  brother monk, Walter of Eynsham. The archbishop-elect was an ignorant  old monk of weak health and doubtful antecedents, and Gregory IX.  wisely refused to confirm the election. On the recommendation of the  king and the bishops, Gregory himself appointed as archbishop Richard,  chancellor of Lincoln, an eloquent and learned secular priest of  handsome person, whose nickname of \"le Grand\" was due to his tall  stature. The first Archbishop of Canterbury since the Conquest directly  nominated by the pope--for even in Langton's case there was a form of  election--Richard le Grand at once began to quarrel with the justiciar,  demanding that he should surrender the custody of Tunbridge castle on  the ground of some ancient claim of the see of Canterbury. Failing to  obtain redress in England, Richard betook himself to Rome in the spring  of 1231. There he regaled the pope's ears with the offences of Hubert,  and of the worldly bishops who were his tools. In August, Richard's  death in Italy left the Church of Canterbury for three years without a  pastor.    While Gregory IX. did more to help Henry against Louis than Honorius  III., the inflexible character and lofty hierarchical ideals of this  nephew of Innocent III. made his hand heavier on the English Church  than that of his predecessor. Above all, Gregory's expenses in pursuing  his quarrel with Frederick II. made the wealth of the English Church a  sore temptation to him. With his imposition of a tax of one-tenth on  all clerical property to defray the expenses of the crusade against the  emperor, papal taxation in England takes a newer and severer phase. The  rigour with which Master Stephen, the pope's collector, extorted the  tax was bitterly resented. Not less loud was the complaint against the  increasing numbers of foreign ecclesiastics forced into English  benefices by papal authority, and without regard for the rights of the  lawful patrons and electors. A league of aggrieved tax-payers and  patrons was formed against the Roman agents. At Eastertide, 1232, bands  of men, headed by a knight named Robert Twenge, who took the nickname  of William Wither, despoiled the Romans of their gains, and distributed  the proceeds to the poor. These doings were the more formidable from  their excellent organisation, and the strong sympathy everywhere  extended to them. Hubert, who hated foreign interference, did nothing  to stop Twenge and his followers. His inaction further precipitated his  ruin. Archbishop Richard had already poisoned the pope's mind against  him, and his suspected connivance with the anti-Roman movement  completed his disfavour. Bitter letters of complaint arrived in England  denouncing the outrages inflicted on the friends of the apostolic see."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16702"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol. 1, January 9, 1915 (#13)"],[1,"claim may sound strange in the ears of those who have just  witnessed and will never forget the suffering of that beautiful little  country, Belgium. They hold that, since Germany invaded Belgium, it is  Germany who broke a treaty and who is to blame.    Mr. Beck considers this to be so self-evident that he deems it  unnecessary to advance any proof. He quotes the Chancellor's speech,  and, moving for a quick verdict, declares his motion of guilty carried.  The matter, however, is not quite so simple for the man who is seeking  for the whole truth. Let us look at the facts.    Belgium was a neutral country, just as any country has the right to  declare itself neutral, with this difference: that in 1839 she had  promised to five powers--Great Britain, France, Russia, Austria, and  Prussia--that she would remain perpetually neutral. These five powers in  their turn had promised to guarantee her neutrality. She was, however, a  sovereign State, and as such had the undoubted right to cease being  neutral whenever she chose by abrogating the Treaty of 1839. If the  other high contracting parties did not agree with her, it was their  right to try to coerce Belgium to keep to her pledges, although this  would undoubtedly have been an infringement of her sovereignty.    The Treaty of 1839 contains the word \"perpetual,\" but so does the treaty  between France and Germany, in which Alsace and Lorraine are ceded by  France to be perpetually an integral part of the German Empire. Does  this mean that France, if the Allies should win, could not retake these  provinces? Nobody probably will believe this.    The Treaty of 1839 was a treaty just like the Treaty of 1871, with this  difference, that the latter treaty was concluded between two powers, and  the earlier one between five powers on one side and Belgium and Holland  on the other. This gave certain rights to all the signatory powers, any  one of whom had the right to feel itself sufficiently aggrieved to go to  war if any other power disregarded the treaty.      Rights of Neutrals.    There was once another neutral State, the city and district of Cracow,  also established by a treaty to which Great Britain was a signatory.  Three of the signers considered the conditions developing in Cracow to  be so threatening that they abolished Cracow as an independent State.  Great Britain sent a polite note of protest, and dropped the matter.    Since that time, however, two Hague Conferences have been held and  certain rules agreed upon concerning the rights and duties of neutrals.  The Belgian status of inviolability rests on these rules, called  conventions, rather than on the Treaty of 1839. During the  Franco-Prussian War of 1870 Mr. Gladstone very clearly stated that he  did not consider the Treaty of 1839 enforceable. Great Britain,  therefore, made two new treaties, one with France and one with Prussia  (quoted and discussed in Boston Evening Transcript, Oct. 14, 1914) in  which she promised to defend Belgian neutrality, by the side of either  France or Prussia, against that one of them who should infringe the  neutrality.    These treaties were to terminate one year after peace had been  concluded between the contestants. A treaty, like the one of 1839,  however, which was considered unenforceable in 1870, can hardly be  claimed to have gained new rights in 1914. In calm moments nobody will  claim that a greater sanctity attaches to it than to the treaty in which  Alsace and Lorraine are ceded forever to Germany.    No, it is The Hague Conventions to which we must look. The first  convention (1899) contained no rules forbidding belligerents from  entering neutral territory. In the second conference it was thought  desirable to formulate such rules, because it was felt that in war  belligerents are at liberty to do what is not expressly forbidden. At  the request of France, therefore, a new set of rules was suggested, to  which Great Britain and Belgium offered valuable amendments. The rules  were finally accepted, and are today parts of international law. They  read; \"Article I. The territory of neutral powers is inviolable. Article  II. Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either  munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral power.\"    These articles, together with the whole convention called \"Rights and  duties of neutral powers and persons in case of war on land,\" have been  ratified and therefore accepted as law by the United States of America,  Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, and Russia and other minor  powers. Great Britain experienced a change of heart, and, although her  own delegates had moved these articles, she refused to ratify them, when  she ratified most of the other conventions on Nov. 27, 1909. (A table  showing the ratifications of conventions has been published by The World  Peace Foundation, Boston.)      The Case of Belgium.    Since Great Britain did not accept these articles as law, she was not  bound by them, for the principle of The Hague Conferences is that a  nation is bound only by those laws which it accepts. The remarkable  fact, therefore, appears that the only one of the big nations which had  refused to accept these articles, and which, therefore, might have moved  her troops across a neutral country and have claimed that she could do  so with a clear conscience because she broke no law which was binding on  her, was Great Britain. And the world now sees the spectacle of Great  Britain claiming to have gone to war because another power did what she  herself could have done, according to her own interpretation, with  impunity. Japan has broken the international law by infringing the  neutrality of China, but Great Britain can claim that she did not break  a law by doing exactly what Japan did.    It is not asserted here that the citizens of Great Britain are not  absolutely sincere in their belief of the causes which have allied them  with the Russians and the Japanese, and the Indians and the Zouaves, and  the negroes and the French and the Belgians against Germany. Their  Government, however, should have known that the presumption of  insincerity exists when one charges against others a crime which one  would have felt at liberty to commit one's self. Yet, more, the British  Government knew better than anybody else that Germany had not even  committed this crime; for, according to all laws of justice, no person  or nation can claim the inviolability of a neutral when he has committed  \"hostile acts against a belligerent, or acts in favor of a belligerent.\"  (Article XVII. of The Hague Conference of 1907.)    The question, therefore, arises, \"Did Belgium commit acts in favor of  one of Germany's opponents, if not actually hostile acts against  Germany?\" In order to understand Germany's charge that Belgium had  committed such acts, attention must be directed to one of the most  unfortunate stipulations of the Treaty of 1839, which compelled Belgium  to maintain several fortresses. This meant that a small neutral people,  sandwiched in between two great powers, had to keep itself informed on  military affairs. Instead of being able to foster a peaceful state of  mind, which is the surest guarantee of neutrality, the Belgians were  forced to think military thoughts.    [Illustration: ANDREW CARNEGIE    _(Photo (c) by Underwood & Underwood.)_    _See Page 415_]    [Illustration: JACOB H. SCHIFF    _(Photo by American Press Assn.)_    _See Page 459_]    In the eighties and early nineties they suspected France of designs on  their integrity. Since then a change in the popular feeling has taken  place and in recent years the instruction of the Belgian artillery, for  instance, was intrusted to French officers in active service. These  officers were constantly at home and very properly concerned with  solving military problems such as a future war with Germany might  present. What was more natural than that these same officers, when they  were detached for a few months or years to Liege or Namur or Huy, taught  their Belgian charges to prepare against a German attack, and to look  upon the French as their friends and the Germans as their enemies? If  conditions had been different, and German officers had been in charge of  Belgian fortresses, the Belgian guns in practice would always have been  trained on imaginary French invaders.      French Officers in Belgian Forts.    If this is understood it will be seen that in the case of war the actual  neutrality of the Belgian garrisons would naturally be determined by the  position taken by that nation whose officers had been in charge of the  Belgian fortresses. And this might be entirely independent of the  professed wishes of the Belgian people or their Government. If French  officers in active service remained in the several fortresses, or even  only in one after the beginning of hostilities, and if the French  campaign plans contemplated an attack through Belgium, then Belgium had  committed an \"act in favor of France\" by not forcing the French officers  to leave, and had forfeited the rights and privileges granted by The  Hague Convention of 1907 to a neutral State.    Did French officers remain in Liege or in any other Belgian fortress  after hostilities had begun, and did France plan to go through Belgium?  Germany has officially made both claims. The first can easily be  substantiated by the Supreme Court of Civilization by an investigation  of the prisoners of war taken in Belgium. Until an impartial  investigation becomes possible no further proof than the claim made by  the German Government can be produced.    The second charge is contained in No. 157 of the English \"White Paper\"  in these words of instruction from the German Foreign Secretary to the  German Ambassador in London: \"Please impress upon Sir Edward Grey that  German Army could not be exposed to French attack across Belgium, which  was planned according to absolutely"]]]
