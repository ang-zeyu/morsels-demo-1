Huyeron veloces--cual nubes que el viento arrebata--    Los breves momentos de dicha que el cielo me dio...    ?Por que mi existencia, ya inutil, su curso dilata,    Si el termino ansiado a su espalda perdido dejo?    Some recent poets have attempted to write ternary  Alexandrine verse. Thus, the Peruvian poet, Jose S.  Chocano (1867-):          Los Estados Unidos, como argolla de bronce,    contra un clavo sujetan de la America un pie;    y la America debe, si pretende ser libre,    imitarles primero, e igualarles despues.                                                                page lxxx    Imitemos ioh Musa! las crujientes estrofas    que en el Norte se arrastran con la gracia de un tren,    y que giren las rimas como ruedas veloces    y que caigan los versos como varas de riel.            (_La epopeya del Pacifico_)      STROPHES    There are certain conventional combinations of line and  rime known by special names. Those used in modern Spanish  may best be considered under the heads (I) Assonance, (II)  Consonantal Rime, and (III) No Rime.    I. (1) The _romance_ is the most characteristic and  national of all Spanish meters. The proper _romance_  consists of 8-syllable lines with assonance in alternate  lines[43] (cf. pp. 1-8, 42, etc.). The structure of the  _romance_ line has already been treated (p. lxi). In the  old _romances_ there was no division into stanzas, but  poets from the end of the sixteenth century on regularly  employ a pause after every fourth line, thereby creating  a series of quatrains (pp. 42, 60, etc.), except in the  drama (p. 19).    [Footnote 43: Historically, of i6-syllable lines, all  assonating.]    (2) Alternate assonance may be employed with lines of  any length. With 11-syllable lines the verse is called  _romance heroico_ or _real_. Lines of seven syllables make  _versos anacreonticos_. The name _endecha_ is given to  some assonated verse of either six (p. 124) or seven  syllables. When the first three lines of a stanza are  of seven syllables and the last of eleven, the verse is  called _endecha real_. For examples of alternate assonance  in lines of various lengths, see pp. 122 (2 examples),  123, 137, 160, 177.    An _estribillo_, or refrain, may be used in any assonating  verse (p. 45).                                                               page lxxxi  (3) The use of alternate assonance in lines of fourteen  syllables (pp. 211, 212) is a none too happy device of the  author.    (4) The _seguidilla_ is usually a stanza of seven lines of  seven and five syllables in length, in this order: 7, 5,  7, 5; 5, 7, 5. There is usually a pause after the fourth  line; lines 2 and 4 have one assonance and lines 5 and 7  another. The assonances change from one stanza to another.  See pp. 112 and 120. In some _seguidillas_ the stanzas  consist only of the first four lines described.    II. The native Spanish strophes are usually combinations  of 8-syllable or shorter lines. The 11-syllable line,  itself an importation from Italy, brought with it many  well-known Italian strophes. In none of the pure Italian  forms are lines ending in _agudos_ or _esdrujulos_  permissible.    (1) The _redondilla mayor_ consists of four 8-syllable  lines with the rime-scheme _abba_ (pp. 149, 167), or,  less commonly, _abab_ (p. 136). It is a common and  characteristic Spanish meter. The _redondilla menor_  has the same form expressed in lines of less than eight  syllables. The same rime-schemes are found with lines of  seven or of eleven (pp. 117, 207) syllables, and with  combinations of eleven and seven (p. 134), or eleven and  five (p. 86) syllables; but they are not properly called  _redondillas_.    (2) The _quintilla_ is a 5-line strophe, usually of  8-syllable lines. Only two rimes are used in one stanza,  and not more than two lines having the same rime should  stand together (pp. 26, 114). _Quintillas_ are sometimes  written with lines of other lengths. Examples with eleven  and seven syllables are found on pp. 128, 133 and 148. The  stanza used in _Vida retirada_ (p. 9) is termed _lira_:  cf. _Introduction_, p. xxiii.                                                              page lxxxii  (3) The _decima_ (or _espinela_) is a 10-line strophe  of 8-syllable lines which may be considered as two  _quintillas_; but there should be a pause after the  fourth line, and the rime-scheme is usually as follows:  _abbaaccddc_.    (4) The _arte mayor_ line has already been described (p.  lxxv). The _copla de arte mayor_ is a stanza of eight such  lines, usually having the rime-scheme _abbaacca_.    (5) The _octava rima_ (Ital. _ottava rima_) is an Italian  form. Each stanza has eight 11-syllable lines with the  rime-scheme _abababcc_. Examples are found of octaves  employing short lines. A variety of the _octava rima_ is  the _octava bermudina_ with the rime-scheme _abbcdeec_,  the lines in _c_ ending in _agudos_.    (6) The _soneto_ (sonnet) is formed of fourteen  11-syllable lines. In the Siglo de Oro it appears as  a much stricter form than the English sonnet of the  corresponding period. The quatrains have the regular  construction _abba_, and the tiercets almost always follow  one of two types: either _cde, cde,_ or _cdcdcd_. See pp.  14, 18, 148, etc.    (7) _Tercetos_ (Italian _terza rima_), the verse used by  Dante in the _Divina Commedia_, are formed of 11-syllable  lines in groups of three, with the rime-scheme _aba, bcb,  cdc_, etc., ending _yzyz_. See p. 15.    (8) The term _cancion_, which means any lyrical  composition, is also applied specifically to a verse  form in which the poet invents a typical strophe, with a  certain length of line and order of rimes, and adheres to  this type of stanza throughout the whole poem. The lines  are of eleven and seven syllables,--the Italian structure.  Of such nature are the poems on pp. 8, 20, 71, 137  (bottom), 174, 190.    The same procedure is employed with lines of any length,   page lxxxiii  but the poem is not then called _cancion_.  For strophes in 10-syllable lines, see p. 199; in  8-syllable lines, pp. 16, 51, 83, 151; in 7-syllables, p.  202.    (9) The _silva_ is a free composition of 11-and 7-syllable  lines. Most of the lines rime, but without any fixed  order, and lines are often left unrimed. See pp. 46, 54,  152, 214 (bottom), etc. A similar freely riming poem in  lines of seven syllables is Villegas' _Cantilena_ (p. 17).    (10) The Asclepiadean verse (p. lxviii) and the Sapphic  (p. lxiv) and Alcaic (p. lxix) strophes have already been  described. These may be rimed, or in blank verse.    (11) Numerous conventional names are given to poems for  some other characteristic than their metrical structure.  Thus a _glosa_ (gloss) is a poem \"beginning with a text, a  line of which enters into each of the stanzas expounding  it.\" A _letra_ may be a short gloss. The name _letrilla_  is applied sometimes to a little poem in short lines which  may be set to music (p. 9), and sometimes to a strophic  poem with a refrain (p. 16). A _madrigal_ is a short  _silva_ upon a light topic, an expanded conceit. The term  _cantilena_ is given to any short piece of verse intended  to be set to music (p. 17). _Serranillas_, in which is  described the meeting of a gentleman with a rustic maiden,  are famous for the examples written by Juan Ruiz and the  Marquis of Santillana. A _villancico_ is a popular poem  with a refrain, usually dealing with an episode celebrated  in a church festival (p. 13).    III. _Versos sueltos, libres_ or _blancos_ (blank verse)  are formed, as in English, of 11-syllable lines, with  occasionally a shorter line thrown in. There is no rime,  but sometimes a couplet may mark the close of an idea. See  pp. 38 and 144, and cf. also p. lx.

Canst thou not get from thy daughter an inkling of what  passed between them, good Foster?\"    \"I tell you plain, Master Varney,\" said Foster, \"my daughter shall not  enter our purposes or walk in our paths. They may suit me well enough,  who know how to repent of my misdoings; but I will not have my child's  soul committed to peril either for your pleasure or my lord's. I may  walk among snares and pitfalls myself, because I have discretion, but I  will not trust the poor lamb among them.\"    \"Why, thou suspicious fool, I were as averse as thou art that thy  baby-faced girl should enter into my plans, or walk to hell at her  father's elbow. But indirectly thou mightst gain some intelligence of  her?\"    \"And so I did, Master Varney,\" answered Foster; \"and she said her lady  called out upon the sickness of her father.\"    \"Good!\" replied Varney; \"that is a hint worth catching, and I will work  upon it. But the country must be rid of this Tressilian. I would have  cumbered no man about the matter, for I hate him like strong poison--his  presence is hemlock to me--and this day I had been rid of him, but that  my foot slipped, when, to speak truth, had not thy comrade yonder come  to my aid, and held his hand, I should have known by this time whether  you and I have been treading the path to heaven or hell.\"    \"And you can speak thus of such a risk!\" said Foster. \"You keep a stout  heart, Master Varney. For me, if I did not hope to live many years, and  to have time for the great work of repentance, I would not go forward  with you.\"    \"Oh! thou shalt live as long as Methuselah,\" said Varney, \"and amass  as much wealth as Solomon; and thou shalt repent so devoutly, that thy  repentance shall be more famous than thy villainy--and that is a bold  word. But for all this, Tressilian must be looked after. Thy ruffian  yonder is gone to dog him. It concerns our fortunes, Anthony.\"    \"Ay, ay,\" said Foster sullenly, \"this it is to be leagued with one who  knows not even so much of Scripture, as that the labourer is worthy of  his hire. I must, as usual, take all the trouble and risk.\"    \"Risk! and what is the mighty risk, I pray you?\" answered Varney. \"This  fellow will come prowling again about your demesne or into your house,  and if you take him for a house-breaker or a park-breaker, is it not  most natural you should welcome him with cold steel or hot lead? Even  a mastiff will pull down those who come near his kennel; and who shall  blame him?\"    \"Ay, I have a mastiff's work and a mastiff's wage among you,\" said  Foster. \"Here have you, Master Varney, secured a good freehold estate  out of this old superstitious foundation; and I have but a poor lease of  this mansion under you, voidable at your honour's pleasure.\"    \"Ay, and thou wouldst fain convert thy leasehold into a copyhold--the  thing may chance to happen, Anthony Foster, if thou dost good service  for it. But softly, good Anthony--it is not the lending a room or two of  this old house for keeping my lord's pretty paroquet--nay, it is not  the shutting thy doors and windows to keep her from flying off that may  deserve it. Remember, the manor and tithes are rated at the clear annual  value of seventy-nine pounds five shillings and fivepence halfpenny,  besides the value of the wood. Come, come, thou must be conscionable;  great and secret service may deserve both this and a better thing. And  now let thy knave come and pluck off my boots. Get us some dinner, and  a cup of thy best wine. I must visit this mavis, brave in apparel,  unruffled in aspect, and gay in temper.\"    They parted and at the hour of noon, which was then that of dinner, they  again met at their meal, Varney gaily dressed like a courtier of the  time, and even Anthony Foster improved in appearance, as far as dress  could amend an exterior so unfavourable.    This alteration did not escape Varney. Then the meal was finished, the  cloth removed, and they were left to their private discourse--\"Thou  art gay as a goldfinch, Anthony,\" said Varney, looking at his host;  \"methinks, thou wilt whistle a jig anon. But I crave your pardon,  that would secure your ejection from the congregation of the zealous  botchers, the pure-hearted weavers, and the sanctified bakers of  Abingdon, who let their ovens cool while their brains get heated.\"    \"To answer you in the spirit, Master Varney,\" said Foster, \"were--excuse  the parable--to fling sacred and precious things before swine. So I will  speak to thee in the language of the world, which he who is king of the  world, hath taught thee, to understand, and to profit by in no common  measure.\"    \"Say what thou wilt, honest Tony,\" replied Varney; \"for be it according  to thine absurd faith, or according to thy most villainous practice,  it cannot choose but be rare matter to qualify this cup of Alicant.  Thy conversation is relishing and poignant, and beats caviare, dried  neat's-tongue, and all other provocatives that give savour to good  liquor.\"    \"Well, then, tell me,\" said Anthony Foster, \"is not our good lord and  master's turn better served, and his antechamber more suitably filled,  with decent, God-fearing men, who will work his will and their own  profit quietly, and without worldly scandal, than that he should be  manned, and attended, and followed by such open debauchers and ruffianly  swordsmen as Tidesly, Killigrew, this fellow Lambourne, whom you have  put me to seek out for you, and other such, who bear the gallows in  their face and murder in their right hand--who are a terror to peaceable  men, and a scandal to my lord's service?\"    \"Oh, content you, good Master Anthony Foster,\" answered Varney; \"he that  flies at all manner of game must keep all kinds of hawks, both short and  long-winged. The course my lord holds is no easy one, and he must  stand provided at all points with trusty retainers to meet each sort of  service. He must have his gay courtier, like myself, to ruffle it in  the presence-chamber, and to lay hand on hilt when any speaks in  disparagement of my lord's honour--\"    \"Ay,\" said Foster, \"and to whisper a word for him into a fair lady's  ear, when he may not approach her himself.\"    \"Then,\" said Varney, going on without appearing to notice the  interruption, \"he must have his lawyers--deep, subtle pioneers--to draw  his contracts, his pre-contracts, and his post-contracts, and to find  the way to make the most of grants of church-lands, and commons, and  licenses for monopoly. And he must have physicians who can spice a cup  or a caudle. And he must have his cabalists, like Dec and Allan, for  conjuring up the devil. And he must have ruffling swordsmen, who would  fight the devil when he is raised and at the wildest. And above  all, without prejudice to others, he must have such godly, innocent,  puritanic souls as thou, honest Anthony, who defy Satan, and do his work  at the same time.\"    \"You would not say, Master Varney,\" said Foster, \"that our good lord  and master, whom I hold to be fulfilled in all nobleness, would use such  base and sinful means to rise, as thy speech points at?\"    \"Tush, man,\" said Varney, \"never look at me with so sad a brow. You trap  me not--nor am I in your power, as your weak brain may imagine, because  I name to you freely the engines, the springs, the screws, the tackle,  and braces, by which great men rise in stirring times. Sayest thou our  good lord is fulfilled of all nobleness? Amen, and so be it--he has the  more need to have those about him who are unscrupulous in his service,  and who, because they know that his fall will overwhelm and crush them,  must wager both blood and brain, soul and body, in order to keep him  aloft; and this I tell thee, because I care not who knows it.\"    \"You speak truth, Master Varney,\" said Anthony Foster. \"He that is head  of a party is but a boat on a wave, that raises not itself, but is moved  upward by the billow which it floats upon.\"    \"Thou art metaphorical, honest Anthony,\" replied Varney; \"that velvet  doublet hath made an oracle of thee. We will have thee to Oxford to take  the degrees in the arts. And, in the meantime, hast thou arranged all  the matters which were sent from London, and put the western chambers  into such fashion as may answer my lord's humour?\"    \"They may serve a king on his bridal-day,\" said Anthony; \"and I promise  you that Dame Amy sits in them yonder as proud and gay as if she were  the Queen of Sheba.\"    \"'Tis the better, good Anthony,\" answered Varney; \"we must found our  future fortunes on her good liking.\"    \"We build on sand then,\" said Anthony Foster; \"for supposing that she  sails away to court in all her lord's dignity and authority, how is she  to look back upon me, who am her jailor as it were, to detain her here  against her will, keeping her a caterpillar on an old wall, when she  would fain be a painted butterfly in a court garden?\"    \"Fear not her displeasure, man,\" said Varney. \"I will show her all thou  hast done in this matter was good service, both to my lord and her;  and when she chips the egg-shell and walks alone, she shall own we have  hatched her greatness.\"    \"Look to yourself, Master Varney,\" said Foster, \"you may misreckon  foully in this matter. She gave you but a frosty reception this morning,  and, I think, looks on you, as well as me, with an evil eye.\"    \"You mistake her, Foster--you mistake her utterly. To me she is bound  by all the ties which can secure her to one who has been the means of  gratifying both her love and ambition. Who was it that took the obscure  Amy Robsart, the daughter of an impoverished and dotard knight--the  destined bride of a moonstruck, moping enthusiast, like Edmund  Tressilian, from her lowly fates, and held"]]]
