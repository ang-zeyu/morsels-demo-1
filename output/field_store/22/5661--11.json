In Box Five on the pit  tier, which is just inside the first exit from the stalls on the left,  they found nothing worth mentioning either.    \"Those people are all making fools of us!\"  Firmin Richard ended by  exclaiming.  \"It will be FAUST on Saturday:  let us both see the  performance from Box Five on the grand tier!\"        Chapter VII  Faust and What Followed      On the Saturday morning, on reaching their office, the joint managers  found a letter from O. G. worded in these terms:    MY DEAR MANAGERS:    So it is to be war between us?    If you still care for peace, here is my ultimatum.  It consists of the  four following conditions:    1.  You must give me back my private box; and I wish it to be at my  free disposal from henceforward.    2.  The part of Margarita shall be sung this evening by Christine Daae.  Never mind about Carlotta; she will be ill.    3.  I absolutely insist upon the good and loyal services of Mme. Giry,  my box-keeper, whom you will reinstate in her functions forthwith.    4.  Let me know by a letter handed to Mme. Giry, who will see that it  reaches me, that you accept, as your predecessors did, the conditions  in my memorandum-book relating to my monthly allowance.  I will inform  you later how you are to pay it to me.    If you refuse, you will give FAUST to-night in a house with a curse  upon it.    Take my advice and be warned in time.  O. G.    \"Look here, I'm getting sick of him, sick of him!\" shouted Richard,  bringing his fists down on his office-table.    Just then, Mercier, the acting-manager, entered.    \"Lachenel would like to see one of you gentlemen,\" he said.  \"He says  that his business is urgent and he seems quite upset.\"    \"Who's Lachenel?\" asked Richard.    \"He's your stud-groom.\"    \"What do you mean?  My stud-groom?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" explained Mercier, \"there are several grooms at the Opera  and M. Lachenel is at the head of them.\"    \"And what does this groom do?\"    \"He has the chief management of the stable.\"    \"What stable?\"    \"Why, yours, sir, the stable of the Opera.\"    \"Is there a stable at the Opera?  Upon my word, I didn't know.  Where  is it?\"    \"In the cellars, on the Rotunda side.  It's a very important  department; we have twelve horses.\"    \"Twelve horses!  And what for, in Heaven's name?\"    \"Why, we want trained horses for the processions in the Juive, The  Profeta and so on; horses 'used to the boards.'  It is the grooms'  business to teach them.  M. Lachenel is very clever at it.  He used to  manage Franconi's stables.\"    \"Very well ... but what does he want?\"    \"I don't know; I never saw him in such a state.\"    \"He can come in.\"    M. Lachenel came in, carrying a riding-whip, with which he struck his  right boot in an irritable manner.    \"Good morning, M. Lachenel,\" said Richard, somewhat impressed.  \"To  what do we owe the honor of your visit?\"    \"Mr. Manager, I have come to ask you to get rid of the whole stable.\"    \"What, you want to get rid of our horses?\"    \"I'm not talking of the horses, but of the stablemen.\"    \"How many stablemen have you, M. Lachenel?\"    \"Six stablemen!  That's at least two too many.\"    \"These are 'places,'\" Mercier interposed, \"created and forced upon us  by the under-secretary for fine arts.  They are filled by protegees of  the government and, if I may venture to ...\"    \"I don't care a hang for the government!\" roared Richard.  \"We don't  need more than four stablemen for twelve horses.\"    \"Eleven,\" said the head riding-master, correcting him.    \"Twelve,\" repeated Richard.    \"Eleven,\" repeated Lachenel.    \"Oh, the acting-manager told me that you had twelve horses!\"    \"I did have twelve, but I have only eleven since Cesar was stolen.\"    And M. Lachenel gave himself a great smack on the boot with his whip.    \"Has Cesar been stolen?\" cried the acting-manager. \"Cesar, the white  horse in the Profeta?\"    \"There are not two Cesars,\" said the stud-groom dryly.  \"I was ten  years at Franconi's and I have seen plenty of horses in my time.  Well,  there are not two Cesars.  And he's been stolen.\"    \"How?\"    \"I don't know.  Nobody knows.  That's why I have come to ask you to  sack the whole stable.\"    \"What do your stablemen say?\"    \"All sorts of nonsense.  Some of them accuse the supers.  Others  pretend that it's the acting-manager's doorkeeper ...\"    \"My doorkeeper?  I'll answer for him as I would for myself!\" protested  Mercier.    \"But, after all, M. Lachenel,\" cried Richard, \"you must have some idea.\"    \"Yes, I have,\" M. Lachenel declared.  \"I have an idea and I'll tell you  what it is.  There's no doubt about it in my mind.\" He walked up to the  two managers and whispered.  \"It's the ghost who did the trick!\"    Richard gave a jump.    \"What, you too!  You too!\"    \"How do you mean, I too?  Isn't it natural, after what I saw?\"    \"What did you see?\"    \"I saw, as clearly as I now see you, a black shadow riding a white  horse that was as like Cesar as two peas!\"    \"And did you run after them?\"    \"I did and I shouted, but they were too fast for me and disappeared in  the darkness of the underground gallery.\"    M. Richard rose.  \"That will do, M. Lachenel.  You can go ...  We will  lodge a complaint against THE GHOST.\"    \"And sack my stable?\"    \"Oh, of course!  Good morning.\"    M. Lachenel bowed and withdrew.  Richard foamed at the mouth.    \"Settle that idiot's account at once, please.\"    \"He is a friend of the government representative's!\" Mercier ventured  to say.    \"And he takes his vermouth at Tortoni's with Lagrene, Scholl and  Pertuiset, the lion-hunter,\" added Moncharmin.  \"We shall have the  whole press against us!  He'll tell the story of the ghost; and  everybody will be laughing at our expense!  We may as well be dead as  ridiculous!\"    \"All right, say no more about it.\"    At that moment the door opened.  It must have been deserted by its  usual Cerberus, for Mme. Giry entered without ceremony, holding a  letter in her hand, and said hurriedly:    \"I beg your pardon, excuse me, gentlemen, but I had a letter this  morning from the Opera ghost.  He told me to come to you, that you had  something to ...\"    She did not complete the sentence.  She saw Firmin Richard's face; and  it was a terrible sight.  He seemed ready to burst.  He said nothing,  he could not speak.  But suddenly he acted.  First, his left arm seized  upon the quaint person of Mme. Giry and made her describe so unexpected  a semicircle that she uttered a despairing cry.  Next, his right foot  imprinted its sole on the black taffeta of a skirt which certainly had  never before undergone a similar outrage in a similar place.  The thing  happened so quickly that Mme. Giry, when in the passage, was still  quite bewildered and seemed not to understand.  But, suddenly, she  understood; and the Opera rang with her indignant yells, her violent  protests and threats.    About the same time, Carlotta, who had a small house of her own in the  Rue du Faubourg St. Honore, rang for her maid, who brought her letters  to her bed.  Among them was an anonymous missive, written in red ink,  in a hesitating, clumsy hand, which ran:    If you appear to-night, you must be prepared for a great misfortune at  the moment when you open your mouth to sing ... a misfortune worse than  death.    The letter took away Carlotta's appetite for breakfast.  She pushed  back her chocolate, sat up in bed and thought hard.  It was not the  first letter of the kind which she had received, but she never had one  couched in such threatening terms.    She thought herself, at that time, the victim of a thousand jealous  attempts and went about saying that she had a secret enemy who had  sworn to ruin her.  She pretended that a wicked plot was being hatched  against her, a cabal which would come to a head one of those days; but  she added that she was not the woman to be intimidated.    The truth is that, if there was a cabal, it was led by Carlotta herself  against poor Christine, who had no suspicion of it.  Carlotta had never  forgiven Christine for the triumph which she had achieved when taking  her place at a moment's notice.  When Carlotta heard of the astounding  reception bestowed upon her understudy, she was at once cured of an  incipient attack of bronchitis and a bad fit of sulking against the  management and lost the slightest inclination to shirk her duties.  From that time, she worked with all her might to \"smother\" her rival,  enlisting the services of influential friends to persuade the managers  not to give Christine an opportunity for a fresh triumph.  Certain  newspapers which had begun to extol the talent of Christine now  interested themselves only in the fame of Carlotta.  Lastly, in the  theater itself, the celebrated, but heartless and soulless diva made  the most scandalous remarks about Christine and tried to cause her  endless minor unpleasantnesses.    When Carlotta had finished thinking over the threat contained in the  strange letter, she got up.    \"We shall see,\" she said, adding a few oaths in her native Spanish with  a very determined air.    The first thing she saw, when looking out of her window, was a hearse.  She was very superstitious; and the hearse and the letter convinced her  that she was running the most serious dangers that evening.  She  collected all her supporters, told them that she was threatened at that  evening's performance with a plot organized by Christine Daae and  declared that they must play a trick upon that chit by filling the  house with her, Carlotta's, admirers.  She had no lack of them, had  she?  She relied upon them to hold themselves prepared for any  eventuality and to silence the adversaries, if, as she feared, they  created a disturbance.    M. Richard's private secretary called to ask after the diva's health  and returned with the assurance that she was perfectly well and that,  \"were she dying,\" she would sing the part of Margarita that evening.

The bambino's such a darling little  thing with such a sweet look in its face. That's St. Agnes outside  the wall--I saw two dear little baby lambs blessed on the altar there  on St. Agnes's day. One was all covered with red garlands and the  other with green. Oh, they were such sweethearts! They were going to  use the fleece to make some garment for the pope. That's Santa Maria  della Salute--they call it Santa Maria della _Volute_ instead of  _Salute_ because it's all covered with volutes.\" Maida smiled  sunnily into Mrs. Lathrop's face as if expecting sympathy with this  architectural joke.    But Mrs. Lathrop did not smile. She looked a little staggered. She  studied Maida for a long time out of her shrewd, light eyes.    \"Whose family did you travel with?\" she asked at last.    Maida felt a little embarrassed. If Mrs. Lathrop asked her certain  questions, it would place her in a very uncomfortable position. On  the one hand, Maida could not tell a lie. On the other, her father  had told her to tell nobody that she was his daughter.    \"The family of Mr. Jerome Westabrook,\" she said at last.    \"Oh!\" It was the \"oh\" of a person who is much impressed. \"'Buffalo'  Westabrook?\" Mrs. Lathrop asked.    \"Yes.\"    \"Did your grandmother, Mrs. Flynn, go with you?\"    \"Yes.\"    Mrs. Lathrop continued to look very hard at Maida. Her eyes wandered  over the little blue frock--simple but of the best materials--over the  white \"tire\" of a delicate plaided nainsook, trimmed with  Valenciennes lace, the string of blue Venetian beads, the soft,  carefully-fitted shoes.    \"Mr. Westabrook has a little girl, hasn't he?\" Mrs. Lathrop said.    Maida felt extremely uncomfortable now. But she looked Mrs. Lathrop  straight in the eye. \"Yes,\" she answered.    \"About your age?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"She is an invalid, isn't she?\"    \"She _was_,\" Maida said with emphasis.    Mrs. Lathrop did not ask any more questions. She went presently into  the back library. An old gentleman sat there, reading.    \"That little girl who keeps the store at the corner is in there,  playing with Laura, father,\" she said. \"I guess her grandmother was  a servant in 'Buffalo' Westabrook's family, for they traveled abroad  a year with the Westabrook family. Evidently, they give her all the  little Westabrook girl's clothes--she's dressed quite out of keeping  with her station in life. Curious how refinement rubs off--the child  has really a good deal of manner. I don't know that I quite like to  have Laura playing with her, though.\"    The two little girls returned after awhile to the playroom.    \"How would you like to have me dance for you?\" Laura asked abruptly.  \"You know I take fancy dancing.\"    \"Oh, Laura,\" Maida said delightedly \"will you?\"    \"Of course I will,\" Laura said with her most beaming expression.  \"You wait here while I go downstairs and get into my costume. Watch  that door, for I shall make my entrance there.\"    Maida waited what seemed a long time to her. Then suddenly Laura  came whirling into the room. She had put on a little frock of  pale-blue liberty silk that lay, skirt, bodice and tiny sleeves, in  many little pleats--\"accordion-pleated,\" Laura afterwards described it.  Laura's neck and arms were bare. She wore blue silk stockings and  little blue-kid slippers, heelless and tied across the ankles with  ribbons. Her hair hung in a crimpy torrent to below her waist.    \"Oh, Laura, how lovely you do look!\" Maida said, \"I think you're  perfectly beautiful!\"    Laura smiled. Lifting both arms above her head, she floated about  the room, dancing on the very tips of her toes. Turning and smiling  over her shoulder, she bent and swayed and attitudinized. Maida  could have watched her forever.    In a few moments she disappeared again. This time she came back in a  red-silk frock with a little bolero jacket of black velvet, hung  with many tinkling coins. Whenever her fingers moved, a little  pretty clapping sound came from them--Maida discovered that she  carried tiny wooden clappers. Whenever her heels came together, a  pretty musical clink came from them--Maida discovered that on her  shoes were tiny metal plates.    Once again Laura went out. This time, she returned dressed like a  little sailor boy. She danced a gay little hornpipe.    \"I never saw anything so marvelous in my life,\" Maida said, her eyes  shining with enjoyment. \"Oh, Laura how I wish I could dance like  that. How did you ever learn? Do you practice all the time?\"    \"Oh, it's not so very hard--for me,\" Laura returned. \"Of course,  everybody couldn't learn. And I suppose you, being lame, could never  do anything at all.\"    This was the first allusion that had been made in Primrose Court to  Maida's lameness. Her face shadowed a little. \"No, I'm afraid I  couldn't,\" she said regretfully. \"But--oh--think what a lovely dancer  Rosie would make.\"    \"I'm afraid Rosie's too rough,\" Laura said. She unfolded a little  fan and began fanning herself languidly. \"It's a great bother  sometimes,\" she went on in a bored tone of voice. \"Everybody is  always asking me to dance at their parties. I danced at a beautiful  May party last year. Did you ever see a May-pole?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" Maida said. \"My birthday comes on May Day and last year  father gave me a party. He had a May-pole set up on the lawn and all  the children danced about it.\"    \"My birthday comes in the summer, too. I always have a party on our  place in Marblehead,\" Laura said. \"I had fifty children at my party  last year. How many did you have?\"    \"We sent out over five hundred invitations, I believe. But not quite  four hundred accepted.\"    \"Four hundred,\" Laura repeated. \"Goodness, what could so many  children do?\"    \"Oh, there were all sorts of things for them to do,\" Maida answered.  \"There was archery and diabolo and croquet and fishing-ponds and a  merry-go-round and Punch and Judy on the lawn and a play in my  little theater--I can't remember everything.\"    Laura's eyes had grown very big. \"Didn't you have a perfectly  splendiferous time?\" she asked.    \"No, not particularly,\" Maida said. \"Not half such a good time as  I've had playing in Primrose Court. I wasn't very well and then,  somehow, I didn't care for those children the way I care for Dicky  and Rosie and the court children.\"    \"Goodness!\" was all Laura could say for a moment. But finally she  added, \"I don't believe that, Maida!\"    Maida stared at her and started to speak. \"Oh, there's the clock  striking four?\" was all she said though. \"I must go. Thank you for  dancing for me.\"    She flew into her coat and hat. She could not seem to get away quick  enough. Nobody had ever doubted her word before. She could not  exactly explain it to herself but she felt if she talked with Laura  another moment, she would fly out of her skin.                            ----------------------    \"Mother,\" Laura said, after Maida had gone, \"Maida Flynn told me  that her father gave her a birthday party last year and invited five  hundred children to it and they had a theater and a Punch and Judy  show and all sorts of things. Do you think it's true?\"    Mrs. Lathrop set her lips firmly. \"No, I think it is probably not  true. I think you'd better not play with the little Flynn girl any  more.\"                            ----------------------    The next afternoon, Maida went, as she had promised, to see Dicky.    She could see at a glance that Mrs. Dore was having a hard struggle  to support her little family. In the size and comfort of its  furnishings, the place was the exact opposite of the Lathrop home.  But, somehow, there was a wonderful feeling of home there.    \"Dicky, how do you manage to keep so clean here?\" Maida asked in  genuine wonder.    And indeed, hard work showed everywhere. The oilcloth shone like  glass. The stove was as clean as a newly-polished shoe. The rows of  pans on the wall fairly twinkled. Delicious smells were filling the  air. Maida guessed that Dicky was making one of the Irish stews that  were his specialty.    \"See that little truck over there?\" Dicky said. \"That helps a lot.  Arthur Duncan made that for me. You see we have to keep our coal in  that closet, way across the room. I used to get awful tired filling  the coal-hod and lugging it over to the stove. But now you see I  fill that truck at the closet, wheel it over to the stove and I  don't have to think of coal for three days.\"    \"Arthur must be a very clever boy,\" Maida said thoughtfully.    \"You bet he is. See that tin can in the sink? Well, I wanted a  soap-shaker but couldn't afford to get one. Arthur took that can and  punched the bottom full of holes. I keep it filled up with all the  odds and ends of soap. When I wash the dishes, I just let the  boiling water from the kettle flow through it. It makes water grand  and soapy. Arthur made me that iron dish-rag and that dish-mop.\"    A sleepy cry came from the corner. Dicky swung across the room.  Balancing himself against the cradle there, he lifted the baby to  the floor. \"She can't walk yet but you watch her go,\" he said  proudly.    Go! The baby crept across the room so fast that Maida had to run to  keep up with her. \"Oh, the love!\" she said, taking Delia into her  arms. \"Think of having a whole baby to yourself.\"    \"Can't leave a thing round where she is,\" Dicky said proudly, as if  this were the best thing he could say about her. \"Have to put _my_  work away the moment she wakes up. Isn't she a buster, though?\"    \"I should say she was!\" And indeed, the baby was as fat as a little  partridge. Maida wondered how Dicky could lift her. Also Delia was  as healthy-looking as Dicky was sickly. Her cheeks showed a pink  that was almost purple and her head looked like a mop, so thickly  was it overgrown with tangled, red-gold curls.    \"Is she named after your mother?\" Maida asked.    \"No--after my grandmother in Ireland. But of course we don't call her  anything but 'ba"]]]
