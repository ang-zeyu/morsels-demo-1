A long while elapsed, and no command was issued; until matters reached  such a state that it was to be feared that sedition might suddenly break  out and the blood of many be shed. Of necessity, for the protection of the  servants of God, a certain number [of the Babis] appealed to the governor  of 'Iraq. If [the King] will consider what has happened with just regard,  it will become clear in the mirror of his luminous heart that what  occurred was [done] from considerations of expediency, and that there was  apparently no resource save this. The Royal Personage can bear witness and  testify to this, that in whatever land there were some few of this sect  the fire of war and conflict was wont to be kindled by reason of the  aggression of certain governors. But this Transient One after His arrival  in 'Iraq withheld all from sedition and strife; and the witness of this  Servant is His action, for all are aware and will testify that the  multitude of this faction in Persia at that time was more than [it had  been] before, yet, notwithstanding this, none transgressed his proper  bounds nor assailed anyone. It is nigh on fifteen years that all continue  tranquil, looking unto God and relying on Him, and bear patiently what  hath come upon them, casting it on God. And after the arrival of this  Servant in this city which is called Adrianople certain of this community  enquired concerning the meaning of 'victory.' Diverse answers were sent in  reply, one of which answers will be submitted on this page, so that it may  become clear before the [Royal] Presence that this Servant hath in view  naught save peace and reform. And if some of the divine favors, which,  without merit [on My part], have been graciously bestowed [on Me], do not  become evident and apparent, this much [at least] will be known, that  [God], in [His] abounding grace and undeserved mercy, hath not deprived  this Oppressed One of the ornament of reason. The form of words which was  set forth on the meaning of 'victory' is this:    \"'He is God, exalted is He. \"'It hath been known that God (glorious is His  mention) is sanctified from the world and what is therein, and that the  meaning of \"victory\" is not this, that anyone should fight or strive with  anyone. The Lord of He doeth what He will(29) hath committed the kingdom  of creation, both land and sea, into the hand of kings, and they are the  manifestations of the Divine Power according to the degrees of their rank:  verily He is the Potent, the Sovereign. But that which God (glorious is  His mention) hath desired for Himself is the hearts of His servants, which  are treasures of praise and love of the Lord and stores of divine  knowledge and wisdom. The will of the Eternal King hath ever been to  purify the hearts of [His] servants from the promptings of the world and  what is therein, so that they may be prepared for illumination by the  effulgences of the Lord of the Names and Attributes. Therefore must no  stranger find his way into the city of the heart, so that the Incomparable  Friend may come unto His own place--that is, the effulgence of His Names  and Attributes, not His Essence (exalted is He), for that Peerless King  hath been and will be holy for everlasting above ascent or descent.  Therefore today \"victory\" neither hath been nor will be opposition to  anyone, nor strife with any person; but rather what is well-pleasing is  that the cities of [men's] hearts, which are under the dominion of the  hosts of selfishness and lust, should be subdued by the sword of the Word,  of Wisdom, and of Exhortation. Everyone, then, who desireth \"victory\" must  first subdue the city of his own heart with the sword of spiritual truth  and of the Word, and must protect it from remembering aught beside God:  afterwards let him turn his regards towards the cities of [others']  hearts. This is what is intended by \"victory\": sedition hath never been  nor is pleasing to God, and that which certain ignorant persons formerly  wrought was never approved. If ye be slain for His good pleasure verily it  is better for you than that ye should slay. Today the friends of God must  appear in such fashion amidst [God's] servants that by their actions they  may lead all unto the pleasure of the Lord of Glory. I swear by the Sun of  the Horizon of Holiness that the friends of God never have regarded nor  will regard the earth or its transitory riches. God hath ever regarded the  hearts of [His] servants, and this too is by reason of [His] most great  favor, that perchance mortal souls may be cleansed and sanctified from  earthly states and may attain unto everlasting places. But that Real King  is in Himself sufficient unto Himself [and independent] of all: neither  doth any advantage accrue to Him from the love of contingent beings, nor  doth any hurt befall Him from their hatred. All earthly places appear  through Him and unto Him return, and God singly and alone abideth in His  own place which is holy above space and time, mention and utterance, sign,  description, and definition, height and depth. And none knoweth this save  Him and whosoever hath knowledge of the Book. There is no God but Him, the  Mighty, the Bountiful.' Finis.    \"But good deeds depend on this, that the Royal Person should himself look  into that [matter] with just and gracious regard, and not be satisfied  with the representations of certain persons unsupported by proof or  evidence. We ask God to strengthen the King unto that which He willeth:  and what He willeth should be the wish of the worlds.    \"Afterwards they summoned this Servant to Constantinople. We reached that  city along with a number of poor unfortunates, and after Our arrival did  not hold intercourse with a single soul, for We had naught to say [unto  them], and there was no wish save that it should be clearly demonstrated  by proof to all that this Servant had no thought of sedition and had never  associated with the seditious. And, by Him in praise of Whose spirit the  tongues of all things speak, to turn in any direction was difficult in  consideration of certain circumstances; but these things were done for the  protection of lives. Verily My Lord knoweth what is in My soul, and verily  He is witness unto what I say. The just king is the shadow of God in the  earth; all should take refuge under the shadow of his justice and rest in  the shade of his favor. This is not the place for personalities, or  censures [directed] specially against some apart from others; for the  shadow tells of him who casteth the shadow. God (glorious is His mention)  hath called Himself the Lord of the worlds for that He hath nurtured and  doth nurture all; exalted is His favor which hath preceded contingent  beings and His mercy which hath preceded the worlds.    \"This is sufficiently clear, that, [whether] right or wrong according to  the imagination of the people, this community have accepted as true and  adopted the religion for which they are notorious, and that on this  account they have foregone what they had, seeking after what is with God.  And this same renunciation of life in the way of love for the Merciful  [God] is a faithful witness and an eloquent attest unto that whereunto  they lay claim. Hath it [ever] been beheld that a reasonable man renounced  his life without proof or evidence [of the truth of that for which he  died]? And if it be said, 'This people are mad,' this [too] is very  improbable, for it is not [a thing] confined to one or two persons, but  rather have a great multitude of every class, inebriated with the  Kaw_th_ar of divine wisdom, hastened with heart and soul to the place of  martyrdom in the way of the Friend. If these persons, who for God have  foregone all save Him, and who have poured forth life and wealth in His  way, can be belied, then by what proof and evidence shall the truth of  that which others assert concerning that wherein they are be established  in the presence of the King?    \"The late Haji Siyyid Muhammad (may God exalt his station and overwhelm  him in the depth of the ocean of His mercy and forgiveness), although he  was of the most learned of the doctors of the age and the most pious and  austere of his contemporaries, and although the splendor of his worth was  of such a degree that the tongues of all creatures spoke in praise and  eulogy of him and confidently asserted his asceticism and godliness, did  nevertheless in the war against the Russians forego much good and turn  back after a little contest, although he himself had decreed a holy war,  and had set out from his native country with conspicuous ensign in support  of the Faith. O would that the covering might be withdrawn, and that what  is hidden from [men's] eyes might appear!    \"But as to this sect, it is twenty years and more that they have been  tormented by day and by night with the fierceness of the Royal anger, and  that they have been cast each one into a [different] land by the blasts of  the tempests of the King's wrath. How many children have been left  fatherless! How many fathers have become childless! How many mothers have  not dared, through fear and dread, to mourn over their slaughtered  children! Many [were] the servants [of God] who at eve were in the utmost  wealth and opulence, and at dawn were beheld in the extreme of poverty and  abasement! There is no land but hath been dyed with their blood and no air  whereunto their groanings have not arisen. And during these few years the  arrows of affliction have rained down without intermission from the clouds  of fate. Yet, notwithstanding all these visitations and afflictions, the  fire of divine love is in such fashion kindled in their hearts that, were  they all to be hewn in pieces,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19312"],[0,"Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas (#13)"],[1,"utmost  brilliancy and splendor from the horizon of the everlasting gift. If he is  alloyed with the slightest trace of passion, desire, ostentation or  self-interest, it is certain that the results of all efforts will prove  fruitless, and he will become deprived and hopeless.    O ye Cohorts of God! Praise be to God! --that the Blessed Perfection hath  freed the necks from the bonds and fetters and released all from racial  attachments by proclaiming, \"Ye are all the fruits of one tree and the  leaves of one branch.\" Be ye kind to the human world, and be ye  compassionate to the race of man, deal with the strangers as you deal with  the friends, be ye gentle toward the outsiders as you are toward the  beloved ones, know the enemy as the friend, look upon the satan as upon  the angel, receive the unjust with the utmost love like unto a faithful  one, and diffuse far and wide the fragrances of the musk of the gazelles  of Kheta and Khotan(35) to the nostrils of the ravenous wolves.    Become ye a shelter and asylum to the fearful ones, be ye a cause of  tranquillity and cease to the souls and hearts of the agitated ones,  impart ye strength to the helpless ones, be ye a remedy and antidote to  the afflicted ones, and a physician and nurse to the sick ones. Serve ye  for the promotion of peace and concord and establishe in this transitory  world the foundation of friendship, fidelity, reconciliation and  truthfulness.    O ye Cohorts of God! Strive ye that this human world may be changed into a  luminous realm and this mound of earth become the Paradise of ABHA.  Darkness hath environed the world upon all sides. Savage tempers and  inclination predominate. The human world has become the battlefield of the  rapacious savages and the arena of the heedless and ignorant ones. The  souls are either bloodthirsty wolves or beasts with degenerate reason.  They are either deadly poison, or worthless plants. There are a few souls  who in reality have some humanitarian intentions and are thinking of the  well-being and prosperity of human kind. You must in this instance (that  is, service to humanity) sacrifice your lives, and in sacrificing your  lives celebrate happiness and beatitude.    O ye Cohorts of God! His Highness, the Supreme(36)--may my life be a  sacrifice to Him! --hath given up His life, and at every moment the Blessed  Perfection(37) in His own life sacrificed hundreds of lives, endured dire  calamities and oppressions. Laden with fetters He was thrown into the dark  dungeon, He was exiled and banished to distant lands and finally passed  His days in the Most Great Prison(38) . Likewise a multitude of friends  drank the sweet chalice of martyrdom and sacrificed soul, possession,  family and relatives for the Cause. How many houses were overthrown! How  many residences were pillaged and rapined! How many magnificent palaces  were turned into a desolate tomb! All these phenomena transpired only that  the world of humanity may become a luminous realm; ignorance be changed  into wisdom, human souls become merciful, warfare and bloodshed be  destroyed to their very foundation, and the Kingdom of Peace become  paramount over all men. Now strive ye, that perchance this Beloved of  Hopes appear in the assemblage of the world and this Providence become a  realized fact.    O ye Cohorts of God! Beware lest ye offend the feelings of anyone, or  sadden the heart of any person, or move the tongue in reproach of and  finding fault with anybody, whether he is friend or stranger, believer or  enemy. Pray in behalf of all and entreat God for forgiveness and bounty  for all. Beware, beware that any soul take revenge or retaliate over  another even if he be a bloodthirsty enemy. Beware, beware that any one  rebuke or reproach a soul, though he may be an ill-wisher and an ill-doer.  Do ye not look upon the creature, advance ye toward the Creator. Behold ye  not the rebellious people, turn your faces toward the Lord of Hosts. Look  ye not upon the ground, raise your eyes to the world-illuminating Sun,  which hath transformed every atom of the gloomy soil into bright and  luminous substance.    O ye Cohorts of God! In the moment of catastrophe, find ye patience,  resignation and submission.    The more the calamities are intensified the less become ye disturbed.  Withstand ye, with perfect assurance, the flood of trials and calamities,  through the power of His Highness, the Almighty.    Last year some of the known and unknown, friends and strangers, slandered,  calumniated and presented false accusations against these exiled ones,  before the throne of His Imperial Majesty, the Padeshah of the Ottomans;  while these oppressed ones were entirely free from those calumnies. The  government, conformable with prudent measures, arose to investigate these  calumnies and dispatched some commissioners (or examiners) to this city.  Therefore it is evident that the field which was found by the ill-wishers  and the flood which was brought about by them, can neither be written nor  explained. However, relying upon God, we conducted ourselves with the  utmost patience and submission, resignation and calmness; so much so that  if one did not know anything about these matters, he would have thought  that we were in perfect ease of soul, enjoying the tranquillity of heart  and mind, and were engaged in happiness and felicity. The matters reached  to such an issue that the plaintiffs and calumniators entered into  alliance and intrigue with the officials, in regard to the carrying out of  the work of investigation. Consequently, the plaintiff, the magistrate and  the witness became as one single soul. Therefore it is clear what things  transpired! But here one witnesses the fairness and impartiality of His  Imperial Majesty, the Padeshah of the Ottomans, who so far has not given  any consideration to these slanders, statements, stories and calumnies,  but has dealt with the utmost justice and equity. Truly, I say, if there  had been any other person except this Padeshah, no trace of these exiled  ones would remain. This is the truth! We must not overlook justice. In  reality today in the Asiatic world, the Padeshah of the Ottoman Empire and  the Shah of Persia, Mozeffer-Eddin, are peerless and have no equals. If  you could realize the degree of the malignity of the enemies, and the  wickedness and mischief done by the ill-wishers, especially by the unkind  brother, both here and in Persia, and that notwithstanding these seditions  and villainies, these two kings have treated us with tranquillity and  mildness, ye would undoubtedly feel sure that both are just. If they were  like kings of bygone ages, unquestionably every day thousands of souls  would have been deprived of life in Persia. Therefore pray ye earnestly in  behalf of these two kings, beseech for them protection and confirmation in  the threshold of the Almighty, and ask for them, from God, victory and  triumph; especially for the Padeshah of the Ottoman Empire, who has dealt  at all times in justice with these exiled ones.    O Thou Omnipotent God! Perfume the nostrils of the friends in the Occident  with the breaths of the Holy Spirit; and illumine the horizon of the West  with the light of guidance. Make the remote ones the near ones, change the  strangers into compassionate friends, awaken those who are asleep, and  make heedful those who are heedless.    O Thou Glorious Lord! Confirm and assist these noble friends with Thy good  pleasure, suffer them to become the well-wishers of the known and unknown,  enter them in the world of the everlasting Kingdom, confer upon them a  share from the outpouring of the Realm of Might, make them real Bahais and  sincere godly ones, deliver them from superficiality and establish them in  Truth, make them the signs of the Kingdom and brilliant stars in the  horizon of the world, make them the cause of the prosperity and composure  of the world of humanity and the servants of the universal peace,  intoxicate all of them with the wine of Thy commands and exhortations and  grant to all good morals and conduct in the path of Thy teachings.    O my God! The desire of this Servant of the Threshold is to see that the  friends of the West have embraced the beloved of the East, and the  individuals of the world of humanity are with the utmost kindness the  members of one assemblage, the drops of one ocean, the birds of one  rose-garden, the pearls of one sea, the leaves of one tree and the rays of  one sun.          \"O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!...\"      O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!    Verily, I received thy letter which proved thy yearning to the Kingdom of  God, thy exceeding desire to the Beauty of God and thy great attachment  unto the Word of God.

Regarding thy presence, at this time, in this Brilliant Spot(39)--it is not  in accord with the wisdom revealed in the Book. But I pray God to make  thee a manifestation of His hidden favors, so that thou be with me in His  Sublime Kingdom.    We send for thee and thy revered wife, stones of the Greatest Name.(40)          \"O thou who art advancing unto God!...\"      O thou who art advancing unto God!    Verily I pray to God to make thee and thy revered husband--under the shadow  of His Greatest Name--confirmed in all conditions, aided in the service of  the Cause of God with a confirmation on the part of the Merciful Lord.    O my God! O my God! I ask thee to protect these two birds in the orchard  of Thy mercy, confirmed in joy and happiness in the garden of Thy  bounties, warbling with the best melodies in the wood (garden) of Thy  knowledge. Verily Thou art the Precious, the Mighty, the Protecting!          \"O ye two accepted ones in the Kingdom of God!...\"      O ye two(41) accepted ones in the Kingdom of God!    Your"]]]
