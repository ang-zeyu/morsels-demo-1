The sun is vanquished  by cloud and storm, but shines forth again in vigour. Vegetation dies,  but undergoes a yearly renewal. So in myth the immortal gods are wounded  and slain in strife. But we must not push too far the analogy of the  apparent strife of the elements and the wars of the gods. The one  suggested the other, especially where the gods were elemental powers.  But myth-making man easily developed the suggestion; gods were like men  and \"could never get eneuch o' fechtin'.\" The Celts knew of divine  combats before their arrival in Ireland, and their own hostile powers  were easily assimilated to the hostile gods of the aborigines.    The principal Fomorians are described as kings. Elatha was son of Net,  described by Cormac as \"a battle god of the heathen Gael,\" i.e. he is  one of the Tuatha De Danann, and has as wives two war-goddesses, Badb  and Nemaind.[187] Thus he resembles the Fomorian Tethra whose wife is a  _badb_ or \"battle-crow,\" preying on the slain.[188] Elatha's name,  connected with words meaning \"knowledge,\" suggests that he was an  aboriginal culture-god.[189] In the genealogies, Fomorians and Tuatha De  Danann are inextricably mingled. Bres's temporary position as king of  the Tuatha Dea may reflect some myth of the occasional supremacy of the  powers of blight. Want and niggardliness characterise his reign, and  after his defeat a better state of things prevails. Bres's consort was  Brigit, and their son Ruadan, sent to spy on the Tuatha De Danann, was  slain. His mother's wailing for him was the first mourning wail ever  heard in Erin.[190] Another god, Indech, was son of Dea Domnu, a  Fomorian goddess of the deep, i.e. of the underworld and probably also  of fertility, who may hold a position among the Fomorians similar to  that of Danu among the Tuatha De Danann. Indech was slain by Ogma, who  himself died of wounds received from his adversary.    Balor had a consort Cethlenn, whose venom killed Dagda. His one eye had  become evil by contact with the poisonous fumes of a concoction which  his father's Druids were preparing. The eyelid required four men to  raise it, when his evil eye destroyed all on whom its glance fell. In  this way Balor would have slain Lug at Mag-tured, but the god at once  struck the eye with a sling-stone and slew him.[191] Balor, like the  Greek Medusa, is perhaps a personification of the evil eye, so much  feared by the Celts. Healthful influences and magical charms avert it;  hence Lug, a beneficent god, destroys Balor's maleficence.    Tethra, with Balor and Elatha, ruled over Erin at the coming of the  Tuatha De Danann. From a phrase used in the story of Connla's visit to  Elysium, \"Thou art a hero of the men of Tethra,\" M. D'Arbois assumes  that Tethra was ruler of Elysium, which he makes one with the land of  the dead. The passage, however, bears a different interpretation, and  though a Fomorian, Tethra, a god of war, might be regarded as lord of  all warriors.[192] Elysium was not the land of the dead, and when M.  D'Arbois equates Tethra with Kronos, who after his defeat became ruler  of a land of dead heroes, the analogy, like other analogies with Greek  mythology, is misleading. He also equates Bres, as temporary king of the  Tuatha De Danann, with Kronos, king of heaven in the age of gold.  Kronos, again, slain by Zeus, is parallel to Balor slain by his grandson  Lug. Tethra, Bres, and Balor are thus separate fragments of one god  equivalent to Kronos.[193] Yet their personalities are quite distinct.  Each race works out its mythology for itself, and, while parallels are  inevitable, we should not allow these to override the actual myths as  they have come down to us.    Professor Rh[^y]s makes Bile, ancestor of the Milesians who came from  Spain, a Goidelic counterpart of the Gaulish Dispater, lord of the dead,  from whom the Gauls claimed descent. But Bile, neither a Fomorian nor of  the Tuatha De Danann, is an imaginary and shadowy creation. Bile is next  equated with a Brythonic Beli, assumed to be consort of Don, whose  family are equivalent to the Tuatha De Danann.[194] Beli was a mythic  king whose reign was a kind of golden age, and if he was father of Don's  children, which is doubtful, Bile would then be father of the Tuatha De  Danann. But he is ancestor of the Milesians, their opponents according  to the annalists. Beli is also equated with Elatha, and since Don,  reputed consort of Beli, was grandmother of Llew, equated with Irish  Lug, grandson of Balor, Balor is equivalent to Beli, whose name is  regarded by Professor Rh[^y]s as related etymologically to Balor's.[195]  Bile, Balor, and Elatha are thus Goidelic equivalents of the shadowy  Beli. But they also are quite distinct personalities, nor are they ever  hinted at as ancestral gods of the Celts, or gods of a gloomy  underworld. In Celtic belief the underworld was probably a fertile  region and a place of light, nor were its gods harmful and evil, as  Balor was.    On the whole, the Fomorians came to be regarded as the powers of nature  in its hostile aspect. They personified blight, winter, darkness, and  death, before which men trembled, yet were not wholly cast down, since  the immortal gods of growth and light, rulers of the bright other-world,  were on their side and fought against their enemies. Year by year the  gods suffered deadly harm, but returned as conquerors to renew the  struggle once more. Myth spoke of this as having happened once for all,  but it went on continuously.[196] Gods were immortal and only seemed to  die. The strife was represented in ritual, since men believe that they  can aid the gods by magic, rite, or prayer. Why, then, do hostile  Fomorians and Tuatha De Danann intermarry? This happens in all  mythologies, and it probably reflects, in the divine sphere, what takes  place among men. Hostile peoples carry off each the other's women, or  they have periods of friendliness and consequent intermarriage. Man  makes his gods in his own image, and the problem is best explained by  facts like these, exaggerated no doubt by the Irish annalists.    The Tuatha De Danann, in spite of their euhemerisation, are more than  human. In the north where they learned magic, they dwelt in four cities,  from each of which they brought a magical treasure--the stone of Fal,  which \"roared under every king,\" Lug's unconquerable spear, Nuada's  irresistible sword, the Dagda's inexhaustible cauldron. But they are  more than wizards or Druids. They are re-born as mortals; they have a  divine world of their own, they interfere in and influence human  affairs. The euhemerists did not go far enough, and more than once their  divinity is practically acknowledged. When the Fian Caoilte and a woman  of the Tuatha De Danann appear before S. Patrick, he asks, \"Why is she  youthful and beautiful, while you are old and wrinkled?\" And Caoilte  replies, \"She is of the Tuatha De Danann, who are unfading and whose  duration is perennial. I am of the sons of Milesius, that are perishable  and fade away.\"[197]    After their conversion, the Celts, sons of Milesius, thought that the  gods still existed in the hollow hills, their former dwellings and  sanctuaries, or in far-off islands, still caring for their former  worshippers. This tradition had its place with that which made them a  race of men conquered by the Milesians--the victory of Christianity over  paganism and its gods having been transmuted into a strife of races by  the euhemerists. The new faith, not the people, conquered the old gods.  The Tuatha De Danann became the _Daoine-sidhe_, a fairy folk, still  occasionally called by their old name, just as individual fairy kings or  queens bear the names of the ancient gods. The euhemerists gave the  Fomorians a monstrous and demoniac character, which they did not always  give to the Tuatha De Danann; in this continuing the old tradition that  Fomorians were hostile and the Tuatha De Danann beneficent and mild.    The mythological cycle is not a complete \"body of divinity\"; its  apparent completeness results from the chronological order of the  annalists. Fragments of other myths are found in the _Dindsenchas_;  others exist as romantic tales, and we have no reason to believe that  all the old myths have been preserved. But enough remains to show the  true nature of the Tuatha De Danann--their supernatural character, their  powers, their divine and unfailing food and drink, their mysterious and  beautiful abode. In their contents, their personages, in the actions  that are described in them, the materials of the \"mythological cycle,\"  show how widely it differs from the Cuchulainn and Fionn cycles.[198]  \"The white radiance of eternity\" suffuses it; the heroic cycles, magical  and romantic as they are, belong far more to earth and time.

These antagonisms are mutually related by  the hidden principle of the Tao (Sec.Sec. 2, 27). Nothing is independent or  capable of existing save through its opposite. The good man and bad man  are equally necessary to each other (Sec. 27). To desire aright is not to  desire (Sec. 64). The saint can do great things because he does not attempt  to do them (Sec. 63). The unwarlike man conquers.[19] He who submits to  others controls them. By this negation of all things we come into  possession of all things (Sec. 68). _Not to act_ is, therefore, the secret of  all power (Sec.Sec. 3, 23, 38, 43, 48, 63).    We find here the same doctrine of opposites which appears in the Phaedo,  and which has come up again and again in philosophy. We shall find  something like it in the Sankhya-karika of the Hindoos. The Duad, with the  Monad brooding behind it, is the fundamental principle of the Avesta.    The result, thus far, is to an active passivity. Lao teaches that not to  act involves the highest energy of being, and leads to the greatest  results. By not acting one identifies himself with the Tao, and receives  all its power. And here we cannot doubt that the Chinese philosopher was  pursuing the same course with Sakya-Muni. The Tao of the one is the  Nirvana of the other. The different motive in each mind constitutes the  difference of their career. Sakya-Muni sought Nirvana, or the absolute,  the pure knowledge, in order to escape from evil and to conquer it. Lao  sought it, as his book shows, to attain power. At this point the two  systems diverge. Buddhism is generous, benevolent, humane; it seeks to  help others. Tao-ism seeks its own. Hence the selfish morality which  pervades the Book of Rewards and Punishments. Every good action has its  reward attached to it. Hence also the degradation of the system into pure  magic and spiritism. Buddhism, though its course runs so nearly parallel,  always retains in its scheme of merits a touch of generosity.    We find thus, in the Tao-te-king, the element afterwards expanded into the  system of utilitarian and eudaemonic ethics in the Book of Rewards and  Punishments. We also can trace in it the source of the magical tendency in  Tao-ism. The principle, that by putting one's self into an entirely  passive condition one can enter into communion with the unnamed Tao, and  so acquire power over nature, naturally tends to magic. Precisely the same  course of thought led to similar results in the case of Neo-Platonism. The  ecstatic union with the divine element in all nature, which Plotinus  attained four times in his life, resulted from an immediate sight of God.  In this sight is all truth given to the soul. The unity, says Plotinus,  which produces all things, is an essence behind both substance and form.  Through this essential being all souls commune and interact, and magic is  this interaction of soul upon soul through the soul of souls, with which  one becomes identified in the ecstatic union. A man therefore can act on  demons and control spirits by theurgic rites. Julian, that ardent  Neo-Platonician, was surrounded by diviners, hierophants, and  aruspices.[20]    In the Tao-te-king (Sec.Sec. 50, 55, 56, etc.) it is said that he who knows the  Tao need not fear the bite of serpents nor the jaws of wild beasts, nor  the claws of birds of prey. He is inaccessible to good and to evil. He  need fear neither rhinoceros nor tiger. In battle he needs neither cuirass  nor sword. The tiger cannot tear him, the soldier cannot wound him. He is  invulnerable and safe from death.[21]    If Neo-Platonism had not had for its antagonist the vital force of  Christianity, it might have established itself as a permanent form of  religion in the Roman Empire, as Tao-ism has in China. I have tried to  show how the later form of this Chinese system has come naturally from its  principles, and how a philosophy of the absolute may have degenerated into  a system of necromancy.        Sec. 6. Religious Character of the \"Kings.\"      We have seen that, in the philosophy of the Confucians, the ultimate  principle is not necessarily identical with a living, intelligent, and  personal God. Nor did Confucius, when he speaks of Teen, or Heaven,  express any faith in such a being. He neither asserted nor denied a  Supreme God. His worship and prayer did not necessarily imply such a  faith. It was the prayer of reverence addressed to some sacred,  mysterious, unknown power, above and behind all visible things. What that  power was, he, with his supreme candor, did not venture to intimate. But  in the She-King a personal God is addressed. The oldest books recognize a  Divine person. They teach that there is one Supreme Being, who is  omnipresent, who sees all things, and has an intelligence which nothing  can escape,--that he wishes men to live together in peace and brotherhood.  He commands not only right actions, but pure desires and thoughts, that we  should watch all our behavior, and maintain a grave and majestic demeanor,  \"which is like a palace in which virtue resides\"; but especially that we  should guard the tongue. \"For a blemish may be taken out of a diamond by  carefully polishing it; but, if your words have the least blemish, there  is no way to efface that.\" \"Humility is the solid foundation of all the  virtues.\" \"To acknowledge one's incapacity is the way to be soon prepared  to teach others; for from the moment that a man is no longer full of  himself, nor puffed up with empty pride, whatever good he learns in the  morning he practices before night.\" \"Heaven penetrates to the bottom of  our hearts, like light into a dark chamber. We must conform ourselves to  it, till we are like two instruments of music tamed to the same pitch. We  must join ourselves with it, like two tablets which appear but one. We  must receive its gifts the very moment its hand is open to bestow. Our  irregular passions shut up the door of our souls against God.\"    Such are the teachings of these Kings, which are unquestionably among the  oldest existing productions of the human mind. In the days of Confucius  they seem to have been nearly forgotten, and their precepts wholly  neglected. Confucius revised them, added his own explanations and  comments, and, as one of the last acts of his life, called his disciples  around him and made a solemn dedication of these books to Heaven. He  erected an altar on which he placed them, adored God, and returned thanks  upon his knees in a humble manner for having had life and health granted  him to finish this undertaking.        Sec. 7. Confucius and Christianity. Character of the Chinese.      It were easy to find defects in the doctrine of Confucius. It has little  to teach of God or immortality. But if the law of Moses, which taught  nothing of a future life, was a preparation for Christianity; if, as the  early Christian Fathers asserted, Greek philosophy was also schoolmaster  to bring men to Christ; who can doubt that the truth and purity in the  teachings of Confucius were providentially intended to lead this great  nation in the right direction? Confucius is a Star in the East, to lead  his people to Christ. One of the most authentic of his sayings is this,  that \"in the West the true Saint must be looked for and found.\" He has a  perception, such as truly great men have often had, of some one higher  than himself, who was to come after him. We cannot doubt, therefore, that  God, who forgets none of his children, has given this teacher to the  swarming millions of China to lead them on till they are ready for a  higher light. And certainly the temporal prosperity and external virtues  of this nation, and their long-continued stability amid the universal  changes of the world, are owing in no small decree to the lessons of  reverence for the past, of respect for knowledge, of peace and order, and  especially of filial piety, which he inculcated. In their case, if in no  other, has been fulfilled the promise of the divine commandment, \"Honor  thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the  Lord thy God giveth thee.\"    In comparing the system of Confucius with Christianity, it appears at once  that Christianity differs from this system, as from most others, in its  greater completeness. Jesus says to the Chinese philosopher, as he said to  the Jewish law, \"I have not come to destroy, but to fulfil.\" He fulfils  the Confucian reverence for the past by adding hope for the future; he  fulfils its stability by progress, its faith in man with faith in God, its  interest in this world with the expectation of another, its sense of time  with that of eternity. Confucius aims at peace, order, outward prosperity,  virtue, and good morals. All this belongs also to Christianity, but  Christianity adds a moral enthusiasm, a faith in the spiritual world, a  hope of immortal life, a sense of the Fatherly presence of God. So that  here, as before, we find that Christianity does not exclude other  religions, but includes them, and is distinguished by being deeper,  higher, broader, and more far-reaching than they.    A people with such institutions and such a social life as we have  described cannot be despised, and to call them uncivilized is as absurd in  us as it is in them to call Europeans barbarians. They are a good,  intelligent, and happy people. Lieutenant Forbes, who spent five years in  China,--from 1842 to 1847,--says: \"I found myself in the midst of as  amiable, kind, and hospitable a population as any on the face of the  earth, as far ahead of us in some things as behind us in others.\" As to  the charge of dishonesty brought against them by those who judge the whole  nation by the degraded population of the suburbs of Canton, Forbes says,  \"My own property suffered more in landing in England and passing the  British frontier than in my whole sojourn in China.\"    \"There is no nation,\" says the"]]]
