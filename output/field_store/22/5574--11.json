Yet only a few tried to escape  conscription by taking refuge in the colonies. For the military regime  gradually penetrated into these colonies as well. The Jewish colonist  was subject to the grim tutelage of Russian \"curators\" and  \"superintendents,\" retired army men, who watched his every step and  punished the slightest carelessness by conscription or expulsion.    In 1836 the Government conceived the idea of enlarging the area of  Jewish agricultural colonization. By an imperial rescript certain lands  in Siberia, situated in the government of Tobolsk and in the territory  of Omsk, were set aside for this purpose. Within a short time 1317 Jews  declared their readiness to settle on the new lands; many had actually  started on their way in batches. But in January, 1837, the Tzar quite  unexpectedly changed his mind. After reading the report of the Council  of Ministers on the first results of the immigration, he put down the  resolution: \"The transplantation of Jews to Siberia is to be stopped.\" A  few months later orders were issued to intercept those Jews who were on  their way to Siberia and transfer them to the Jewish colonies in the  government of Kherson. The unfortunate emigrants were seized on the way  and conveyed, like criminals, under a military escort into places in  which they were not in the least interested. Legislative whims of this  kind, coupled with an uncouth system of tutelage, were quite sufficient  to crush in many Jews the desire of turning to the soil.    Nevertheless, the colonization made slow progress, gradually spreading  from the government of Kherson to the neighboring governments of  Yekaterinoslav and Bessarabia. Stray Jewish agricultural settlements  also appeared in Lithuania and White Russia. But a comparative handful  of some ten thousand \"Jewish peasants\" could not affect the general  economic make-up of millions of Jews. In spite of all shocks, the  economic structure of Russian Jewry remained essentially the same. As  before, the central place in this structure was occupied by the liquor  traffic, though modified in a certain measure by the introduction of a  more extensive system of public leases. Above the rank and file of  tavern keepers, both rural and urban, there had arisen a class of  wealthy tax-farmers, who kept a monopoly on the sale of liquor or the  collection of excise in various governments of the Pale. They functioned  as the financial agents of the exchequer, while the Jewish employees in  their mills, store-houses, and offices acted as their sub-agents,  forming a class of \"officials\" of their own. The place next in  importance to the liquor traffic was occupied by retail and wholesale  commerce. The crafts and the spiritual professions came last. Pauperism  was the inevitable companion of this economic organization, and \"people  without definite occupations\" were counted by the hundreds of thousands.      6. THE RITUAL MURDER TRIAL OF VELIZH    The \"ordinary\" persecutions under which the Jews in Russia were groaning  were accompanied by afflictions of an extraordinary kind. The severest  among these were the ritual murder trials which became of frequent  occurrence, tending to deepen the medieval gloom of that period. True,  ritual murder cases had occurred during the reign of Alexander I., but  it was only under Nicholas that they assumed a malign and dangerous  form. In the year 1816, shortly before Passover, a dead body was found  in the vicinity of Grodno and identified as that of the four year old  daughter of a Grodno resident, Mary Adamovich. Rumors were spread among  the superstitious Christian populace to the effect that the girl had  been killed for ritual purposes, and the police, swayed by these rumors,  set about to find the culprit among the Jews. Suspicion fell on a member  of the Grodno Kahal, Shalom Lapin, whose house adjoined that of the  Adamovich family. The only \"evidence\" against him were a hammer and a  pike found in his house. A sergeant, named Savitzki, a converted Jew,  appeared as a material witness before the Commission of Inquiry, and  delivered himself of a statement full of ignorant trash, which was  intended to show that \"Christian blood is exactly what is needed  according to the Jewish religion\"--here the witness referred to the  Bible story of the Exodus and to two mythical authorities, \"the  philosopher Rossie and the prophet Azariah.\" He further deposed that  \"every rabbi is obliged to satisfy the whole Kahal under his  jurisdiction by smearing with same (with Christian blood) the lintels of  every house on the first day of the feast of Passover.\" Prompted by  greed and by the desire to distinguish himself, the sergeant declared  himself ready to substantiate his testimony from Jewish literature, \"if  the chief Government will grant him the necessary assistance.\"    The results of this \"secret investigation\" were laid before the governor  of Grodno and reported by him to St. Petersburg. In reply, Alexander I.  issued a rescript in February, 1817, ordering that the \"secret  investigation be cut short and the murderer be found out\" intimating  thereby that search be made for the criminal and not for the tenets of  the Jewish religion. However, all efforts to discover the culprit  failed, and the case was dismissed.    This favorable issue was in no small measure due to the endeavors of the  \"Deputies of the Jewish People,\" [1] in particular to Sonnenberg, the  deputy from Grodno. These deputies, who were present in St. Petersburg  at that time, addressed themselves to Golitzin, the Minister of  Ecclesiastical Affairs, protesting against the ritual murder libel. The  trial at Grodno and the ritual murder accusations which simultaneously  cropped up in the Kingdom of Poland made the Minister of Ecclesiastical  Affairs realize that there was in the Western region a dangerous  tendency of making the Jews the scapegoats for every mysterious murder  case and of fabricating lawsuits of the medieval variety by bringing  popular superstition into play. Golitzin, a Christian pietist, who was  nevertheless profoundly averse to narrow ecclesiastic fanaticism,  decided to strike at the root of this superstitious legend which was  disgracing Poland in her period of decay and was about to fall as a dark  stain upon Russia. He succeeded in impressing this conviction upon his  like-minded sovereign Alexander I. In the same month in which the ukase  concerning \"the Society of Israelitish Christians\" was published [2]  Golitzin sent out the following circular to the governors, dated March  6, 1817:    [Footnote 1: See Vol. I, p. 394.]    [Footnote 2: Compare Vol. I, p. 396.]      In view of the fact that in several of the provinces acquired from    Poland, cases still occur in which the Jews are falsely accused of    murdering Christian children for the alleged purpose of obtaining    blood, his Imperial Majesty, taking into consideration that similar    accusations have on previous numerous occasions been refuted by    impartial investigations and royal charters, has been graciously    pleased to convey to those at the head of the governments his    Sovereign will: that henceforward the Jews shall not be charged with    murdering Christian children, without any evidence and purely as a    result of the superstitious belief that they are in need of    Christian blood.    One might have thought that this emphatic rescript would suffice to put  a stop to the efforts of ignorant adventurers to resuscitate the bloody  myth. And, for several years, indeed, the sinister agitation kept quiet.  But towards the end of Alexander's reign it came to life again, and gave  rise to the monstrous Velizh case.    In the year 1823, on the first day of the Christian Passover, a boy of  three years, Theodore Yemelyanov, the son of a Russian soldier,  disappeared in the city of Velizh, in the government of Vitebsk. Ten  days later the child's body was found in a swamp beyond the town,  stabbed all over and covered with wounds. The medical examination and  the preliminary investigation were influenced by the popular belief that  the child had been tortured to death by the Jews. This belief was  fostered by two Christian fortune-tellers, a prostitute beggar-woman,  called Mary Terentyeva, and a half-witted old maid, by the name of  Yeremyeyeva, who by way of divination made the parents of the child  believe that its death was due to the Jews. At the judicial inquiry,  Terentyeva implicated two of the most prominent Jews of Velizh, the  merchant Shmerka [1] Berlin, and Yevzik [2] Zetlin, a member of the  local town council.    [Footnote 1: A popular form of the name Shemariah.]    [Footnote 2: The Russian form of _Yozel_, a variant of the name Joseph.]    Protracted investigations failed to substantiate the fabrications of  Terentyeva, and in the autumn of 1884 the Supreme Court of the  government of Vitebsk rendered the following verdict:      To leave the accidental death of the soldier boy to the will of God;    to declare all the Jews, against whom the charge of murder has been    brought on mere surmises, free from all suspicion; to turn over the    soldier woman Terentyeva, for her profligate conduct, to a priest    for repentance.    However, in view of the exceptional gravity of the crime, the Court  recommended to the gubernatorial administration to continue its  investigations.    Despite the verdict of the court, the dark forces among the local  population, prompted by hatred of the Jews, bent all their efforts on  putting the investigation on the wrong track. The low, mercenary  Terentyeva became their ready tool. When in September, 1825, Alexander  I. was passing through Velizh, she submitted a petition to him,  complaining about the failure of the authorities to discover the  murderer of little Theodore, whom she unblushingly designated as her own  child and declared to have been tortured to death by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15767"],[0,"The Texan Scouts: A Story of the Alamo and Goliad (#13)"],[1,"was made weeks and weeks ago,\" replied Ned confidently, \"and the  men who made it were Mexicans. They were soldiers, the army of Cos, that  we took at San Antonio, and which we allowed to retire on parole into  Mexico.\"    \"There's no doubt you're right,\" said the Panther. \"There's no other  force in this part of the world big enough to make such a wide an'  lastin' trail. An' I think it's our business to follow these tracks.  What do you say, Obed?\"    \"It's just the one thing in the world that we're here to do,\" said the  Maine man. \"Broad is the path and straight is the way that leads before  us, and we follow on.\"    \"Do we follow them down into Mexico?\" said Ned.    \"I don't think it likely that we'll have to do it,\" replied the Panther,  glancing at Obed.    Ned caught the look and he understood.    \"Do you mean,\" he asked, \"that Cos, after taking his parole and pledging  his word that he and his troops would not fight against us, would stop  at the Rio Grande?\"    \"I mean that an' nothin' else,\" replied the Panther. \"I ain't talkin'  ag'in Mexicans in general. I've knowed some good men among them, but I  wouldn't take the word of any of that crowd of generals, Santa Anna,  Cos, Sesma, Urrea, Gaona, Castrillon, the Italian Filisola, or any of  them.\"    \"There's one I'd trust,\" said Ned, with grateful memory, \"and that's  Almonte.\"    \"I've heard that he's of different stuff,\" said the Panther, \"but it's  best to keep out of their hands.\"    They were now riding swiftly almost due southward, having changed their  course to follow the trail, and they kept a sharp watch ahead for  Mexican scouts or skirmishers. But the bare country in its winter brown  was lone and desolate. The trail led straight ahead, and it would have  been obvious now to the most inexperienced eye that an army had passed  that way. They saw remains of camp fires, now and then the skeleton of a  horse or mule picked clean by buzzards, fragments of worn-out clothing  that had been thrown aside, and once a broken-down wagon. Two or three  times they saw little mounds of earth with rude wooden crosses stuck  upon them, to mark where some of the wounded had died and had been  buried.    They came at last to a bit of woodland growing about a spring that  seemed to gush straight up from the earth. It was really an open grove  with no underbrush, a splendid place for a camp. It was evident that  Cos's force had put it to full use, as the earth nearly everywhere had  been trodden by hundreds of feet, and the charred pieces of wood were  innumerable. The Panther made a long and critical examination of  everything.    \"I'm thinkin',\" he said, \"that Cos stayed here three or four days. All  the signs p'int that way. He was bound by the terms we gave him at San  Antonio to go an' not fight ag'in, but he's shorely takin' his time  about it. Look at these bones, will you? Now, Ned, you promisin' scout  an' skirmisher, tell me what they are.\"    \"Buffalo bones,\" replied Ned promptly.    \"Right you are,\" replied the Panther, \"an' when Cos left San Antonio he  wasn't taking any buffaloes along with him to kill fur meat. They staid  here so long that the hunters had time to go out an' shoot game.\"    \"A long lane's the thief of time,\" said Obed, \"and having a big march  before him, Cos has concluded to walk instead of run.\"    \"'Cause he was expectin' somethin' that would stop him,\" said the  Panther angrily. \"I hate liars an' traitors. Well, we'll soon see.\"    Their curiosity became so great that they rode at a swift trot on the  great south trail, and not ten miles further they came upon the  unmistakable evidences of another big camp that had lasted long.    \"Slower an' slower,\" muttered the Panther. \"They must have met a  messenger. Wa'al, it's fur us to go slow now, too.\"    But he said aloud:    \"Boys, it ain't more'n twenty miles now to the Rio Grande, an' we can  hit it by dark. But I'm thinkin' that we'd better be mighty keerful now  as we go on.\"    \"I suppose it's because Mexican scouts and skirmishers may be watching,\"  said Ned.    \"Yes, an' 'specially that fellow Urrea. His uncle bein' one of Santa  Anna's leadin' gen'rals, he's likely to have freer rein, an', as we  know, he's clever an' active. I'd hate to fall into his hands again.\"    They rode more slowly, and three pairs of eyes continually searched the  plain for an enemy. Ned's sight was uncommonly acute, and Obed and the  Panther frequently appealed to him as a last resort. It flattered his  pride and he strove to justify it.    Their pace became slower and slower, and presently the early twilight of  winter was coming. A cold wind moaned, but the desolate plain was broken  here and there by clumps of trees. At the suggestion of the Panther  they rode to one of these and halted under cover of the timber.    \"The river can't be much more than a mile ahead,\" said the Panther, \"an'  we might run into the Mexicans any minute. We're sheltered here, an'  we'd better wait a while. Then I think we can do more stalkin'.\"    Obed and Ned were not at all averse, and dismounting they stretched  themselves, easing their muscles. Old Jack hunted grass and, finding  none, rubbed Ned's elbow with his nose suggestively.    \"Never mind, old boy,\" said Ned, patting the glossy muzzle of his  faithful comrade. \"This is no time for feasting and banqueting. We are  hunting Mexicans, you and I, and after that business is over we may  consider our pleasures.\"    They remained several hours among the trees. They saw the last red glow  that the sun leaves in the west die away. They saw the full darkness  descend over the earth, and then the stars come trooping out. After that  they saw a scarlet flush under the horizon which was not a part of the  night and its progress. The Panther noted it, and his great face  darkened. He turned to Ned.    \"You see it, don't you? Now tell me what it is.\"    \"That light, I should say, comes from the fires of an army. And it can  be no other army than that of Cos.\"    \"Right again, ain't he, Obed?\"    \"He surely is. Cos and his men are there. He who breaks his faith when  he steals away will have to fight another day. How far off would you say  that light is, Panther?\"    \"'Bout two miles, an' in an hour or so we'll ride fur it. The night will  darken up more then, an' it will give us a better chance for lookin' an  listenin'. I'll be mightily fooled if we don't find out a lot that's  worth knowin'.\"    True to Obed's prediction, the night deepened somewhat within the hour.  Many of the stars were hidden by floating wisps of cloud, and objects  could not be seen far on the dusky surface of the plain. But the  increased darkness only made the scarlet glow in the south deepen. It  seemed, too, to spread far to right and left.    \"That's a big force,\" said the Panther. \"It'll take a lot of fires to  make a blaze like that.\"    \"I'm agreeing with you,\" said Obed. \"I'm thinking that those are the  camp fires of more men than Cos took from San Antonio with him.\"    \"Which would mean,\" said Ned, \"that another Mexican army had come north  to join him.\"    \"Anyhow, we'll soon see,\" said the Panther.    They mounted their horses and rode cautiously toward the light.          CHAPTER V    SANTA ANNA'S ADVANCE      The three rode abreast, Ned in the center. The boy was on terms of  perfect equality with Obed and the Panther. They treated him as a man  among men, and respected his character, rather grave for one so young,  and always keen to learn.    The land rolled away in swells as usual throughout a great part of  Texas, but they were not of much elevation and the red glow in the south  was always in sight, deepening fast as they advanced. They stopped at  last on a little elevation within the shadow of some myrtle oaks, and  saw the fires spread before them only four or five hundred yards away,  and along a line of at least two miles. They heard the confused murmur  of many men. The dark outlines of cannon were seen against the  firelight, and now and then the musical note of a mandolin or guitar  came to them.    \"We was right in our guess,\" said the Panther. \"It's a lot bigger force  than the one that Cos led away from San Antonio, an' it will take a heap  of rippin' an' t'arin' an' roarin' to turn it back. Our people don't  know how much is comin' ag'in 'em.\"    The Panther spoke in a solemn tone. Ned saw that he was deeply impressed  and that he feared for the future. Good cause had he. Squabbles among  the Texan leaders had reduced their army to five or six hundred men.    \"Don't you think,\" said Ned, \"that we ought to find out just exactly  what is here, and what this army intends?\"    \"Not a doubt of it,\" said Obed. \"Those who have eyes to see should not  go away without seeing.\"    The Panther nodded violently in assent.    \"We must scout about the camp,\" he said. \"Mebbe we'd better divide an'  then we can all gather before day-break at the clump of trees back  there.\"    He pointed to a little cluster of trees several hundred yards back of  them, and Ned and Obed agreed. The Panther turned away to the right,  Obed to the left and Ned took the center. Their plan of dividing their  force had a great advantage. One man was much less likely than three to  attract undue attention.    Ned went straight ahead a hundred yards or more, when he was stopped by  an arroyo five or six feet wide and with very deep banks. He looked  about, uncertain at first what to do. Obed and the Panther had already  disappeared in the dusk. Before him glowed the red light, and he heard  the distant sound of many voices.    Ned quickly decided. He remembered how they had escaped up the bed of  the creek when they were besieged by Urrea, and if one could leave by an  arroyo, one could also approach by it. He rode to the group of trees  that had been designated as the place of meeting, and left his horse  there. He noticed considerable grass within the ring of trunks, and he  was quite confident "]]]
