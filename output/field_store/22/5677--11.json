Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and    statist policies, the economy in the late 1980s was plagued with huge    external debts and recurring bouts of hyperinflation. Elected in 1989,    in the depths of recession, President MENEM has implemented a    comprehensive economic restructuring program that shows signs of    putting Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable growth. Argentina's    currency has traded at par with the US dollar since April 1991, and    inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20 years. Argentines have    responded to the relative price stability by repatriating flight    capital and investing in domestic industry. Growth slowed somewhat in    1993 but Argentina still registered an impressive 6% advance, fueled    largely by inflows of foreign capital and strong domestic consumption    spending. The government's major short term objective is encouraging    exports, e.g., by reducing domestic costs of production. Much remains    to be done in the 1990s in dismantling the old statist barriers to    growth and in solidifying the recent economic gains.

She could never again  be content with the old rut. Miss Harmon's dull lessons would be  intolerable, and life without Garnet's friendship would seem a blank.  The companionship of her three little sisters was totally inadequate for  a girl who was fast growing up. She shrank from speculating how her  mother would receive the bad news. Mrs. Woodward was one of those  parents who expect their children to gain the prizes which they were  incapable of winning for themselves. She had claimed a kind of  second-hand credit in her daughter's triumph. Winona knew from past  experience that so keen a disappointment would involve a string of  reproaches, regrets and fretting. She would probably never hear the  last of it. The family hopes had been pinned upon her success, and to  frustrate them was to court utter disgrace. For the present she must  live with this sword of Damocles hanging over her head, but she hoped  the Governors would decide the matter speedily, and put her out of her  misery.    There is one virtue in a supreme trouble--it dwarfs all minor griefs.  Percy's secret, which had been felt as a continual burden, seemed to  sink into comparative obscurity, and the worry of school work and the  dread of Miss Huntley's sarcasm were mere flies in the ointment. Winona  never quite knew how she got through the week that followed. It stayed  afterwards in her memory as a period of black darkness, a valley of  humiliation, in which her old childish self slipped away, and a new,  stronger and more capable personality was born to face the future. She  had resigned herself so utterly to the inevitable, that when at last  Miss Bishop's summons came, she was able to walk quite calmly into the  study. The Principal was seated as usual at her bureau; Winona's  entrance examination papers lay before her. Her manner was  non-committal; her blue eyes looked even more penetrating than usual.    \"You will have been wondering what was going to happen about the matter  of the scholarship,\" she began.    \"Yes, Miss Bishop,\" answered Winona meekly. She did not add that she had  spent eight days in a mental purgatory.    \"I of course placed the facts before the Governors, and we at once  communicated with the parents of Marjorie Kaye. We find, however, that  in the meantime she has been elected a scholar of the Maria Harvey  Foundation, and will therefore be unable to accept this scholarship. Her  papers and those of Garnet Emerson were the only ones of outstanding  merit. In re-examining the remaining eighteen we find a uniform level of  mediocrity. As regards your set of papers, the general standard is low,  with one exception. We consider that your essay on Lady Jane Grey shows  an originality and a capacity for thought which may be worthy of  training. On the strength of this--and this alone--the Governors have  decided to allow you to retain your scholarship. In so doing they are  perfectly within their rights. They did not undertake to grant free  tuition to the candidate who scored the highest number of marks, but to  the one who, in their opinion, was most likely to benefit by the school  course. It was a matter to be settled entirely at their discretion. I  have carefully re-read your papers, and compared them with your form  record, and I come to the conclusion that you are backward and  ill-instructed in many subjects, but that you are not idle or stupid. I  shall make arrangements for you to have special coaching in mathematics,  Latin and chemistry until you can keep up with the rest of the Form. I  find your reports for history and English literature are good, which  confirms my opinion that you do not lack ability. You will need to work  very hard, especially at those subjects in which you are so deficient,  but I trust you will soon show a marked improvement, and thus justify  the decision of the Governors. Are you prepared to try?\"    \"I don't know how to thank you--I'll do my very best!\" stammered Winona,  quite overcome by this unexpected _denouement_.    \"Then that is all that need be said. Miss Lever will take you every day  from 3.30 to 4.15 for private tuition. Mark that on your time-table, and  go to her this afternoon in the Preparatory Room. You may tell Miss  Garside that I am disengaged now, and at liberty to speak to her.\"    Winona left the study with very different feelings from those with which  she had entered. Her spirits were so high that she wanted to dance along  the corridor. She could hardly believe her good fortune. Those great and  important gentlemen, the Governors, had actually approved of her essay  to the extent of allowing it to stand as her qualification for the  Scholarship! She blessed Lady Jane Grey, and Edgar Allan Poe, and  Browning, and Andre de Chenier, and the happy chance that had made her  combine them all. She was glad she had paid that visit to Hampton Court,  and that she had seen Lady Jane Grey's portrait, and had been able to  describe both. Life was going to be a very exhilarating business, now  her position in the school was once more secure.    \"I'll show them how I can work,\" she thought. \"They shan't be sorry that  they let me stay after all! Oh, I am in luck! Yes, I'm the luckiest girl  in the school!\"          CHAPTER VII    An Autumn Foray      Winona felt that she now started life at the High School on an entirely  new basis. Miss Bishop and Miss Huntley understood her limitations and  judged her accordingly. It was not by any means that they lowered their  standard, but that they appreciated her difficulty in keeping up with  the Form and gave her credit for her hard work. And hard work it  undoubtedly was. She would get up early in the morning to revise her  lessons before breakfast, and would sit toiling over books and exercises  in the evenings till even Aunt Harriet--indefatigable worker  herself--would tell her to stop, and wax moral on the folly of burning  the candle at both ends. The coaching from Miss Lever was of inestimable  value. It supplied just the gaps in which she was deficient, and gave  her an adequate grasp of her three toughest subjects. Slowly she began  to make headway, she saw light in mathematical problems that had before  been meaningless formulae, chemistry was less of a hopeless tangle, and  Vergil's lines construed into understandable sentences instead of utter  nonsense. It was only gradual progress, however. She had much ground to  cover before she caught up the Form. She was plodding, but not a  brilliant all-round scholar like Garnet. The fact was that Winona was  only clever in one direction: in the realm of imagination her mind ran  like a racehorse, but harnessed to heavy intellectual burdens it proved  but a sorry steed.    It was fortunate for both her health and her spirits that head work did  not represent the only side of school activities. Miss Bishop was wise  enough to lay much stress on physical development. A ten minutes' drill  was part of the daily routine, a gymnasium practice was held twice a  week, and Wednesday afternoons were devoted to hockey. In addition to  this the girls played tennis on the asphalt courts during the winter and  spring terms, whenever the weather was suitable, and basket ball was  constantly going on in the playground. Athletics was decidedly the  fashionable cult of the school. Kirsty Paterson, as Games Captain, made  it her business to see that nobody slacked without justifiable cause.  She would break up knots of chatting idlers, and cajole them forth to  \"cultivate muscle\" as she expressed it, while her keen eye was quick to  note anybody's \"points\" and employ them for the general benefit.  Kirsty's jolly, breezy manner and strict sense of justice made her an  admirable captain. She was highly popular with juniors as well as  seniors, for she took the trouble to organize the games of the little  girls as carefully as those of their elders.    \"It's insane short-sighted policy to neglect the kids,\" was her creed.  \"Now's the time to be training them. Get them thoroughly well in hand  and make them understand what's expected from them, and in four or five  years' time they'll be crack players. Yes, I know it's looking far  ahead, and we prefects won't be here to see the result, but the school  will reap the benefit some day and that's the main thing to aim at. I'm  proud of my cadets and, in the future, when they're winning laurels for  the Seaton High, perhaps they'll remember I started them on the right  track. 'Keep up the standard all round' is going to be the motto while  I'm Captain.\"    To Winona athletics and organized games came as a revelation. She had a  slim wiry little figure and was a good runner, with a capacity for  keeping her breath, and had also a considerable power of spring, all of  which stood her in good stead both in the hockey field and in the  gymnasium. Though Kirsty said little, she could feel her efforts were  being watched and approved, and the knowledge gave her a tingling sense  of satisfaction. It was delightful to feel that she was a factor in this  big school, and that she was doing her bit--however insignificant--to  help up the athletic standard. In physical agility Winona was superior  to Garnet. She could beat her easily at tennis, and there was already a  wide gap between their gymnastic achievements. It was a fortunate  circumstance, for it just balanced their friendship, and put them on a  footing of equality which would have been otherwise absent. Garnet, so  manifestly first in Form work, possessed of greater confidence and  _savoir faire_ in school life and older in experience for her years than  Winona, might have monopolized the lead too entirely, had she not been  obliged to yield the palm of outdoor sports to her friend.    Garnet was, in truth, just a trifle inclined to \"boss.\" She liked  Winona, and wanted her for a chum, but she loved to lay down the law and  to constitute "]]]
