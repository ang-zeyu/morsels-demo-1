Generally speaking he does not encourage the erection of buildings in  memory to individual believers at the present time. But as those at  Yerrinbool serve a useful purpose and that the memory of dear Father Dunn  commemorates the life of the man who brought the Faith to the Continent of  Australia, we may welcome it in the spirit it was given.    As to what uses should be made of the building purchased by the S.A. of  Adelaide, he leaves the decision to your body and that Assembly. He hopes  that at a future date it can be used as a Summer School.    It is the duty of the N.S.A. to exercise the greatest wisdom, forbearance  and tact in handling the affairs of the Cause. Many of the differences  which arise between the believers are due to their immaturity, their  extreme zeal and sincerity.    He will pray for you all in the Holy Shrines, that the Beloved may assist  and strengthen you in the discharge of your sacred duties to the Faith and  its adherents in Australia and New Zealand.    With Baha'i love,  R. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Read and approved,    Shoghi.            LETTER OF AUG. 8TH, 1945      Haifa, Aug. 8th, 1945.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    The beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer your letters dated June  12th, 15th and 25th, and to acknowledge receipt of the numerous enclosures  you forwarded with them.    As he has already expressed to you in his recent messages he greatly  regretted the tone of certain recent communications from the N.S.A.    He cannot too strongly point out to you all that any condition of  inharmony places in jeopardy the wonderful achievements recently made in  the spread and consolidation of the Cause in Australia and New Zealand.  The beloved Master pointed out over and over again that unity and love  among the friends promotes harmony and the rapid spread of the Faith, and  that when these are sacrificed and disputes, anger and violent criticism  take their place, the Cause cannot move forward.    The N.S.A.s the world over, owing to the spiritual immaturity of the  believers, must at the present time exert the greatest patience in dealing  with the friends; otherwise, as seems to be rapidly becoming the case in  Australia, the friends will take sides, bitterness will increase and what  started out as a small thing, (however unjustified and regrettable a  departure from the Baha'i spirit) will become a menace to the progress of  the Faith and definitely retard its progress.    He feels that Mrs. ... and Miss ... , both of whom love their religion and  are devoted to its promotion, should be called upon to forget and forgive  the past, and concentrate on serving the Faith. These are the ways in  which the Baha'is can demonstrate true spiritual nobility and detachment.  In such delicate and complicated cases, the N.S.A. should appeal to the  believers to put the interests of the Cause first, regardless of any  personal sacrifice of feelings this may require.    He assures you he will pray ardently for the speedy and satisfactory  solution of this entire matter.    With warm Baha'i greetings,  R. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    It is my fervent hope and prayer that the members of the Baha'i  communities of Australia and New Zealand, will, now that the machinery of  the Administrative Order of their Faith has been erected, redouble their  efforts to proclaim, with one voice and in a most effective manner, those  vital and healing principles for which the great mass of their war-weary  and much tested countrymen are hungering. This supreme issue must have  precedence over all other considerations, must be given immediate and  anxious attention, must be faced courageously and continually, and be  regarded by individual believers as well as their elected representatives  as the supreme objective of the manifold administrative institutions they  have reared and are still labouring to establish. Complete harmony, mutual  understanding, unity of purpose, coordination of efforts, prayerful  consideration of, and mature deliberation on, all the aspects and  requirements of this great and sacred objective can alone ensure its  triumphant consummation during these years of stress and peril through  which mankind is passing. May the national elected representatives of both  communities set a superb example to their fellow-workers throughout that  far-off continent, and enable them to win memorable victories in the  service of their glorious Faith and its God-given institutions.    Your true brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF MARCH 25TH, 1946      Haifa, March 25th, 1946.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    Your letters, written on behalf of the N.S.A. and dated June 15th, and  16th, July 26th and Sep. 15th, 1945, and Jan. 7th, 1946, together with  their enclosures, have been received, and the beloved Guardian has  instructed me to answer them on his behalf.    He is very pleased to see the progress the Cause is making in Australia  and New Zealand and hopes that the N.S.A. will not only inspire and  encourage the believers in their teaching activities, but will also  constantly impress on them the need for the greatest love and unity to  prevail in their midst; the masses will only really turn to the Faith when  they see that in it true religion is practiced as well as preached!    The recent articles attacking the Cause are a sign that its influence is  sufficiently felt to be feared--a great compliment to the progress you are  making in spreading the message!    Concerning the various points raised in your letters: He noticed, from  your letter of Jan. 7th, that you were planning to hold the annual  Convention in May, and cabled you that it must be held in the Ridvan  period--as are all the other National Baha'i Conventions the world  over,--even though some other date might be more convenient locally.    He feels that the Yerrinbool Summer School should hold longer sessions; in  this respect the friends cannot do better than to pattern themselves on  the American Summer Schools, some of which now hold two or three Summer  sessions, and even a \"Winter Session\". Although such a large number of  sessions may be premature for Australia at present, the goal should be  kept in mind as you seek to expand your school.    There can be no schism in the Baha'i Faith because the Guardianship is  established on an unassailable foundation, supported by a signed, sealed  document--the Will. Schism can only flourish where there is ambiguity or no  specific proof. The New History Society is like a branch that has no  roots, and will soon dry up and wither. It has not caused, nor can it  cause, a breach among the believers.    He was very happy to see you are now establishing Regional Teaching  Com.'s, and hopes you will concentrate all your resources, and the energy  of the friends, on establishing new Assemblies and groups.    He assures you, one and all, that his loving prayers will be offered for  your guidance and for the success of your important work.    With warm Baha'i greetings,  R. Rabbani.    P.S. He was very pleased to see the article on the Faith in \"Truth\". The  Cause is certainly getting very good publicity out there!    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The activities initiated by the dearly beloved friends in Australia and  New Zealand, and so diligently promoted by them all are highly  meritorious; and will, no doubt, bear abundant fruit in the days to come.  The utmost effort should be exerted by individuals as well as local  assemblies to increase the number of the active supporters of the Faith  and to enable them to disperse as widely as possible, to multiply the  groups that must sooner or later evolve into assemblies, to achieve  greater publicity for the Faith through the radio and the press, to extend  the range of the activities of the Baha'i Faith, to foster the institution  of the summer-school, and to consolidate and enlarge the scope of the  Haziratu'l-Quds. These are the main objectives that demand the  concentrated attention of the Australian and New Zealand believers during  the months that lie immediately ahead. No sacrifice is too great to ensure  the realisation of these noble aims. All must arise and unitedly endeavour  to carry to a successful conclusion these vital tasks, with which the  immediate destinies of the Faith are so closely linked. That the Beloved  may guide and sustain you in all your undertakings, that He may crown your  assiduous labours with magnificent success is my dearest wish and ardent  prayer.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF MAY 25TH, 1946      Haifa, May 25th, 1946.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    Your letter dated April 27th has been received and the beloved Guardian  has instructed me to answer it on his behalf. He also acknowledges receipt  of the enclosures forwarded with it.    He trusts that by the time this letter reaches you the complications which  arose at Convention, about the election, will have been satisfactorily  straightened out; as he already cabled you, this was a question for the  out-going N.S.A. to decide.    He feels that the National Spiritual Assembly during the coming year  should focus both its and the believers' attention on the all-important  teaching work, and the necessity of increasing the number of groups and  assemblies throughout Australia and New Zealand. The friends should be  urged and encouraged to arise both as pioneers and travelling teachers,  and they should receive, in cases where they cannot afford it themselves,  financial aid from the National Fund. Such measures are at the present  time absolutely necessary, as the believers are few, the hour very  pressing, and most of them not sufficiently well-off to do "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19275"],[0,"God Passes By (#13)"],[1,"brother of Muhammad _Sh_ah, had left behind  in his headlong flight from his camp. We cannot but esteem the passionate  sincerity with which Mulla Husayn pleaded with the Prince, and the formal  assurance he gave him, disclaiming, in no uncertain terms, any intention  on his part or that of his fellow-disciples of usurping the authority of  the _Sh_ah or of subverting the foundations of his state. We cannot but  view with contempt the conduct of that arch-villain, the hysterical, the  cruel and overbearing Sa'idu'l-'Ulama', who, alarmed at the approach of  those same companions, flung, in a frenzy of excitement, and before an  immense crowd of men and women, his turban to the ground, tore open the  neck of his shirt, and, bewailing the plight into which Islam had fallen,  implored his congregation to fly to arms and cut down the approaching  band. We are struck with wonder as we contemplate the super-human prowess  of Mulla Husayn which enabled him, notwithstanding his fragile frame and  trembling hand, to slay a treacherous foe who had taken shelter behind a  tree, by cleaving with a single stroke of his sword the tree, the man and  his musket in twain. We are stirred, moreover, by the scene of the arrival  of Baha'u'llah at the Fort, and the indefinable joy it imparted to Mulla  Husayn, the reverent reception accorded Him by His fellow-disciples, His  inspection of the fortifications which they had hurriedly erected for  their protection, and the advice He gave them, which resulted in the  miraculous deliverance of Quddus, in his subsequent and close association  with the defenders of that Fort, and in his effective participation in the  exploits connected with its siege and eventual destruction. We are amazed  at the serenity and sagacity of that same Quddus, the confidence he  instilled on his arrival, the resourcefulness he displayed, the fervor and  gladness with which the besieged listened, at morn and at even-tide, to  the voice intoning the verses of his celebrated commentary on the Sad of  Samad, to which he had already, while in Sari, devoted a treatise thrice  as voluminous as the Qur'an itself, and which he was now, despite the  tumultuary attacks of the enemy and the privations he and his companions  were enduring, further elucidating by adding to that interpretation as  many verses as he had previously written. We remember with thrilling  hearts that memorable encounter when, at the cry \"Mount your steeds, O  heroes of God!\" Mulla Husayn, accompanied by two hundred and two of the  beleaguered and sorely-distressed companions, and preceded by Quddus,  emerged before daybreak from the Fort, and, raising the shout of \"Ya  Sahibu'z-Zaman!\", rushed at full charge towards the stronghold of the  Prince, and penetrated to his private apartments, only to find that, in  his consternation, he had thrown himself from a back window into the moat,  and escaped bare-footed, leaving his host confounded and routed. We see  relived in poignant memory that last day of Mulla Husayn's earthly life,  when, soon after midnight, having performed his ablutions, clothed himself  in new garments, and attired his head with the Bab's turban, he mounted  his charger, ordered the gate of the Fort to be opened, rode out at the  head of three hundred and thirteen of his companions, shouting aloud \"Ya  Sahibu'z-Zaman!\", charged successively the seven barricades erected by the  enemy, captured every one of them, notwithstanding the bullets that were  raining upon him, swiftly dispatched their defenders, and had scattered  their forces when, in the ensuing tumult, his steed became suddenly  entangled in the rope of a tent, and before he could extricate himself he  was struck in the breast by a bullet which the cowardly Abbas-Quli  _Kh_an-i-Larijani had discharged, while lying in ambush in the branches of  a neighboring tree. We acclaim the magnificent courage that, in a  subsequent encounter, inspired nineteen of those stout-hearted companions  to plunge headlong into the camp of an enemy that consisted of no less  than two regiments of infantry and cavalry, and to cause such  consternation that one of their leaders, the same Abbas-Quli _Kh_an,  falling from his horse, and leaving in his distress one of his boots  hanging from the stirrup, ran away, half-shod and bewildered, to the  Prince, and confessed the ignominious reverse he had suffered. Nor can we  fail to note the superb fortitude with which these heroic souls bore the  load of their severe trials; when their food was at first reduced to the  flesh of horses brought away from the deserted camp of the enemy; when  later they had to content themselves with such grass as they could snatch  from the fields whenever they obtained a respite from their besiegers;  when they were forced, at a later stage, to consume the bark of the trees  and the leather of their saddles, of their belts, of their scabbards and  of their shoes; when during eighteen days they had nothing but water of  which they drank a mouthful every morning; when the cannon fire of the  enemy compelled them to dig subterranean passages within the Fort, where,  dwelling amid mud and water, with garments rotting away with damp, they  had to subsist on ground up bones; and when, at last, oppressed by gnawing  hunger, they, as attested by a contemporary chronicler, were driven to  disinter the steed of their venerated leader, Mulla Husayn, cut it into  pieces, grind into dust its bones, mix it with the putrified meat, and,  making it into a stew, avidly devour it.    Nor can reference be omitted to the abject treachery to which the impotent  and discredited Prince eventually resorted, and his violation of his  so-called irrevocable oath, inscribed and sealed by him on the margin of  the opening surih of the Qur'an, whereby he, swearing by that holy Book,  undertook to set free all the defenders of the Fort, pledged his honor  that no man in his army or in the neighborhood would molest them, and that  he would himself, at his own expense, arrange for their safe departure to  their homes. And lastly, we call to remembrance, the final scene of that  sombre tragedy, when, as a result of the Prince's violation of his sacred  engagement, a number of the betrayed companions of Quddus were assembled  in the camp of the enemy, were stripped of their possessions, and sold as  slaves, the rest being either killed by the spears and swords of the  officers, or torn asunder, or bound to trees and riddled with bullets, or  blown from the mouths of cannon and consigned to the flames, or else being  disemboweled and having their heads impaled on spears and lances. Quddus,  their beloved leader, was by yet another shameful act of the intimidated  Prince surrendered into the hands of the diabolical Sa'idu'l-'Ulama' who,  in his unquenchable hostility and aided by the mob whose passions he had  sedulously inflamed, stripped his victim of his garments, loaded him with  chains, paraded him through the streets of Barfuru_sh_, and incited the  scum of its female inhabitants to execrate and spit upon him, assail him  with knives and axes, mutilate his body, and throw the tattered fragments  into a fire.    This stirring episode, so glorious for the Faith, so blackening to the  reputation of its enemies--an episode which must be regarded as a rare  phenomenon in the history of modern times--was soon succeeded by a parallel  upheaval, strikingly similar in its essential features. The scene of  woeful tribulations was now shifted to the south, to the province of Fars,  not far from the city where the dawning light of the Faith had broken.  Nayriz and its environs were made to sustain the impact of this fresh  ordeal in all its fury. The Fort of _Kh_ajih, in the vicinity of the  _Ch_inar-Su_kh_tih quarter of that hotly agitated village became the  storm-center of the new conflagration. The hero who towered above his  fellows, valiantly struggled, and fell a victim to its devouring flames  was that \"unique and peerless figure of his age,\" the far-famed Siyyid  Yahyay-i-Darabi, better known as Vahid. Foremost among his perfidious  adversaries, who kindled and fed the fire of this conflagration was the  base and fanatical governor of Nayriz, Zaynu'l-Abidin _Kh_an, seconded by  'Abdu'llah _Kh_an, the _Sh_uja'u'l-Mulk, and reinforced by Prince Firuz  Mirza, the governor of _Sh_iraz. Of a much briefer duration than the  Mazindaran upheaval, which lasted no less than eleven months, the  atrocities that marked its closing stage were no less devastating in their  consequences. Once again a handful of men, innocent, law-abiding,  peace-loving, yet high-spirited and indomitable, consisting partly, in  this case, of untrained lads and men of advanced age, were surprised,  challenged, encompassed and assaulted by the superior force of a cruel and  crafty enemy, an innumerable host of able-bodied men who, though  well-trained, adequately equipped and continually reinforced, were  impotent to coerce into submission, or subdue, the spirit of their  adversaries.    This fresh commotion originated in declarations of faith as fearless and  impassioned, and in demonstrations of religious enthusiasm almost as  vehement and dramatic, as those which had ushered in the Mazindaran  upheaval. It was instigated by a no less sustained and violent outburst of  uncompromising ecclesiastical hostility. It was accompanied by  corresponding manifestations of blind religious fanaticism. It was  provoked by similar acts of naked aggression on the part of both clergy  and people. It demonstrated afresh the same purpose, was animated  throughout by the same spirit, and rose to almost the same height of  superhuman heroism, of fortitude, courage, and renunciation. It revealed a  no less shrewdly calculated coordination of plans and efforts between the  civil and ecclesiastical authorities designed to challenge and overthrow a  common enemy. It was preceded by a similar"]]]
