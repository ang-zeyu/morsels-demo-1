The recent war[131] had served to inflame the long-standing             65  quarrel between Lugdunum and Vienne.[132] Much damage was done on both  sides, and the frequency and animosity of their conflicts proved that  they were not merely fighting for Nero and Galba. Galba had made his  displeasure an excuse for confiscating to the Treasury the revenues of  Lugdunum, while on Vienne he had conferred various distinctions. The  result was a bitter rivalry between the towns, and the Rhone between  them only formed a bond of hatred. Consequently the inhabitants of  Lugdunum began to work on the feelings of individual Roman soldiers,  and to urge them to crush Vienne. They reminded them how the Viennese  had laid siege to Lugdunum, a Roman colony, had assisted the efforts  of Vindex, and had lately raised troops to defend Galba. Having  supplied a pretext for bad feeling, they went on to point out the rich  opportunity for plunder. Not content with private persuasion, they  presented a formal petition that the army would march to avenge them,  and destroy the head-quarters of the Gallic war. Vienne, they urged,  was thoroughly un-Roman and hostile, while Lugdunum was a Roman  colony,[133] contributing men to the army and sharing in its victories  and reverses. They besought them in the event of adverse fortune not  to leave their city to the fury of its enemies.    By these arguments and others of the same nature they brought           66  matters to such a pass, that even the generals and party leaders  despaired of cooling the army's indignation. However, the Viennese  realized their danger. Arrayed in veils and fillets,[134] they met the  approaching column and, seizing their hands and knees and the soles of  their feet in supplication, succeeded in appeasing the troops. Valens  made each of the soldiers a present of three hundred sesterces.[135]  They were thus persuaded to respect the antiquity and high standing of  the colony, and to listen with patience to their general's speech, in  which he commended to them the lives and property of the Viennese.  However, the town was disarmed, and private individuals had to assist  the army with various kinds of provisions. There was, however, a  persistent rumour that Valens himself had been bought with a heavy  bribe. He had long been in mean circumstances and ill concealed his  sudden accession of wealth. Prolonged poverty had whetted his  inordinate desires, and the needy youth grew into an extravagant old  man.    He next led the army by slow stages through the country of the  Allobroges and Vocontii,[136] bribes to the general determining the  length of each day's march and the choice of a camp. For Valens struck  disgraceful bargains with the landowners and municipal authorities,  often applying violent threats, as, for instance, at Lucus,[137] a  township of the Vocontii, which he threatened to burn, until he was  appeased with money. Where it was impossible to get money, he was  mollified by appeals to his lust. And so it went on until the Alps  were reached.    FOOTNOTES:        [124] Metz.

THE MARCH OF CAECINA'S COLUMN    There was even more looting and bloodshed on Caecina's march. The       67  Helvetii, a Gallic tribe[138] once famous as fighting men and still  distinguished by the memory of their past, having heard nothing of  Galba's murder, refused to acknowledge the authority of Vitellius.  This exasperated Caecina's headstrong nature. Hostilities broke out  owing to the greed and impatience of the Twenty-first legion, who had  seized a sum of money which was being sent to pay the garrison of a  fort in which the Helvetii used to keep native troops at their own  expense.[139] The Helvetii, highly indignant at this, intercepted a  dispatch from the German army to the Pannonian legions, and kept a  centurion and some men in custody. Greedy for battle, Caecina hastened  to take immediate vengeance without giving them time for second  thoughts. Promptly breaking up his camp, he proceeded to harry the  country, and sacked a charming and much-frequented watering-place,[140]  which had grown during the long peace into the size and importance of  a town. Instructions were sent to the Raetian auxiliaries to attack  the Helvetii in the rear, while their attention was occupied with the  legion.    Full of spirit beforehand, the Helvetii were terrified in the face      68  of danger. At the first alarm they had chosen Claudius Severus  general, but they knew nothing of fighting or discipline and were  incapable of combined action. An engagement with the Roman veterans  would be disastrous; and the walls, dilapidated by time, could not  stand a siege. They found themselves between Caecina and his powerful  army on the one side, and on the other the Raetian auxiliaries, both  horse and foot, and the whole fighting force of Raetia as well,  trained soldiers well used to fighting.[141] Their country was given  over to plunder and massacre. Flinging away their arms, they wandered  miserably between two fires. Wounded and scattered, most of them took  refuge on the Boetzberg.[142] But some Thracian auxiliaries were  promptly sent to dislodge them. The German army, aided by the  Raetians, pursued them through the woods, and cut them to pieces in  their hiding-places. Many thousands were killed and many sold as  slaves. Having completed the work of destruction, the army advanced in  hostile array against Aventicum,[143] their capital town, and were met  by envoys offering surrender. The offer was accepted. Caecina executed  Julius Alpinus, one of their chief men, as the prime instigator of the  revolt. The rest he left to experience the clemency or cruelty of  Vitellius.    It is hard to say whether these envoys found Vitellius or the army the  more implacable. The soldiers clamoured for the destruction of the  town,[144] and shook their fists and weapons in the envoys' faces:  even Vitellius indulged in threatening language. Ultimately, however,  Claudius Cossus, one of the envoys, a noted speaker who greatly  enhanced the effect of his eloquence by concealing his skill under a  well-timed affectation of nervousness, succeeded in softening the  hearts of the soldiers. A mob is always liable to sudden changes of  feeling, and the men were as sensible to pity as they had been  extravagant in their brutality. Thus with streams of tears and  importunate prayers for a better answer the envoys procured a free  pardon for Aventicum.[145]    Caecina halted for a few days in Helvetian territory until he           70  could get news of Vitellius' decision. Meantime, while carrying on his  preparations for crossing the Alps, he received from Italy the joyful  news that 'Silius' Horse',[146] stationed at Padua, had come over to  Vitellius. The members of this troop had served under Vitellius when  pro-consul in Africa. They had subsequently been detached under orders  from Nero to precede him to Egypt, and had then been recalled, owing  to the outbreak of the war with Vindex. They were now in Italy. Their  officers, who knew nothing of Otho and were attached to Vitellius,  extolled the strength of the approaching column and the fame of the  German army. So the troop went over to Vitellius, bringing their new  emperor a gift of the four strongest towns of the Transpadane  district, Milan, Novara, Eporedia,[147] and Vercelli. Of this they  informed Caecina themselves. But one troop of horse could not garrison  the whole of the widest part of Italy. Caecina accordingly hurried  forward the Gallic, Lusitanian, and British auxiliaries, and some  German detachments, together with 'Petra's Horse',[148] while he  himself hesitated whether he should not cross the Raetian Alps[149]  into Noricum and attack the governor, Petronius Urbicus, who, having  raised a force of irregulars and broken down the bridges, was supposed  to be a faithful adherent of Otho. However, he was afraid of losing  the auxiliaries whom he had sent on ahead, and at the same time he  considered that there was more glory in holding Italy, and that,  wherever the theatre of the war might be, Noricum was sure to be among  the spoils of victory. So he chose the Pennine route[150] and led his  legionaries and the heavy marching column across the Alps, although  they were still deep in snow.[151]    FOOTNOTES:        [138] In Western Switzerland.

The most  victorious King William approved and confirmed this decision.\"            Chapter 5    The Times: 1100-1154    King Henry I, son of William of Normandy, furthered peace between  the Normans and native English by his marriage to a niece of  King Edward the Confessor called Matilda. She married him on  condition that he grant a charter of rights undoing some  practices of the past reigns of William I and William II. Peace  was also furthered by the fact that Henry I had been born in  England and English was his native tongue. Private wars were now  replaced by mock battles.    Henry was a shrewd judge of character and of the course of  events, cautious before taking action, but decisive in carrying  out his plans. He was faithful and generous to his friends. He  showed a strong practical element of calculation and foresight.  He was intelligent and a good administrator. He had an efficient  intelligence gathering network and an uncanny knack of detecting  hidden plans before they became conspiratorial action. He made  many able men of inferior social position nobles, thus creating  a class of career judges and administrators in opposition to the  extant hereditary aristocracy. He loved books and built a palace  at Oxford to which he invited scholars for lively discussion.    Queen Matilda served as regent in Henry's absence. She was  literate and a literary patron. Her compassion was great and her  charities extensive. She founded a care-giving hospital and had  new roads and bridges built.    Henry issued charters restoring customs which had been  subordinated to royal impositions by previous Kings, which set a  precedent for later Kings. His coronation charter describes  certain property rights he restored after the oppressive reign  of his brother.    \"Henry, King of the English, to Samson the bishop, and Urse of  Abbetot, and to all his barons and faithful vassals, both French  and English, in Worcestershire, greeting.    [1.] Know that by the mercy of God and by the common counsel of  the barons of the whole kingdom of England I have been crowned  king of this realm. And because the kingdom has been oppressed  by unjust exactions, I now, being moved by reverence towards God  and by the love I bear you all, make free the Church of God; so  that I will neither sell nor lease its property; nor on the death  of an archbishop or a bishop or an abbot will I take anything  from the demesne of the Church or from its vassals during the  period which elapses before a successor is installed. I abolish  all the evil customs by which the kingdom of England has been  unjustly oppressed. Some of those evil customs are here set  forth.    [2.] If any of my barons or of my earls or of any other of my  tenants shall die his heir shall not redeem his land as he was  wont to do in the time of my brother [William II (Rufus)], but  he shall henceforth redeem it by means of a just and lawful  'relief`. Similarly the men of my barons shall redeem their  lands from their lords by means of a just and lawful 'relief`.    [3.] If any of my barons or of my tenants shall wish to give in  marriage his daughter or his sister or his niece or his cousin,  he shall consult me about the matter; but I will neither seek  payment for my consent, nor will I refuse my permission, unless  he wishes to give her in marriage to one of my enemies. And if,  on the death of one of my barons or of one of my tenants, a  daughter should be his heir, I will dispose of her in marriage  and of her lands according to the counsel given me by my barons.  And if the wife of one of my tenants shall survive her husband  and be without children, she shall have her dower and her  marriage portion [that given to her by her father], and I will  not give her in marriage unless she herself consents.    [4.] If a widow survives with children under age, she shall have  her dower and her marriage portion, so long as she keeps her  body chaste; and I will not give her in marriage except with her  consent. And the guardian of the land, and of the children,  shall be either the widow or another of their relations, as may  seem more proper. And I order that my barons shall act likewise  towards the sons and daughters and widows of their men.    [5.] I utterly forbid that the common mintage [a forced levy to  prevent loss to the King from depreciation of the coinage],  which has been taken from the towns and shires, shall henceforth  be levied, since it was not so levied in the time of King Edward  [the Confessor, before the Norman conquest]. If any moneyer or  other person be taken with false money in his possession, let  true justice be visited upon him.    [6.] I forgive all pleas and all debts which were owing to my  brother [William II], except my own proper dues, and except  those things which were agreed to belong to the inheritance of  others, or to concern the property which justly belonged to  others. And if anyone had promised anything for his heritage, I  remit it, and I also remit all 'reliefs` which were promised for  direct inheritance.    [7.] If any of my barons or of my men, being ill, shall give away  or bequeath his movable property, I will allow that it shall be  bestowed according to this desires. But if, prevented either by  violence or through sickness, he shall die intestate as far as  concerns his movable property, his widow or his children, or his  relatives or one his true men shall make such division for the  sake of his soul, as may seem best to them.    [8.] If any of my barons or of my men shall incur a forfeit, he  shall not be compelled to pledge his movable property to an  unlimited amount, as was done in the time of my father [William  I] and my brother; but he shall only make payment according to  the extent of his legal forfeiture, as was done before the time  of my father and in the time of my earlier predecessors.  Nevertheless, if he be convicted of breach of faith or of crime,  he shall suffer such penalty as is just.    [9.] I remit all murder-fines which were incurred before the day  on which I was crowned King; and such murder-fines as shall now  be incurred shall be paid justly according to the law of King  Edward [by sureties].    [10.] By the common counsel of my barons I have retained the  forests in my own hands as my father did before me.    [11.] The knights, who in return for their estates perform  military service equipped with a hauberk [long coat] of mail,  shall hold their demesne lands quit of all gelds [money  payments] and all work; I make this concession as my own free  gift in order that, being thus relieved of so great a burden,  they may furnish themselves so well with horses and arms that  they may be properly equipped to discharge my service and to  defend my kingdom.    [12.] I establish a firm peace in all my kingdom, and I order  that this peace shall henceforth be kept.    [13.] I restore to you the law of King Edward together with such  emendations to it as my father [William I] made with the counsel  of his barons.    [14.] If since the death of my brother, King William [II], anyone  shall have seized any of my property, or the property of any  other man, let him speedily return the whole of it. If he does  this no penalty will be exacted, but if he retains any part of  it he shall, when discovered, pay a heavy penalty to me.

At London when I was crowned. Farewell.\"    Henry took these promises seriously, which resulted in peace and  justice. Royal justice became a force to be reckoned with by the  multiplication of justices. Henry had a great respect for  legality and the forms of judicial action. He became known as  the \"Lion of Justice\".    The center of government was a collection of tenants-in-chief  whose feudal duty included attendance when summoned and certain  selected household servants of the King. When it met for  financial purposes, Henry called it the Exchequer and it became  a separate body. It received yearly from the sheriffs of the  counties taxes, fines, treasure trove, goods from wrecks,  deodands, and movable property of felons, of persons executed,  of fugitives, and of outlaws due to the Crown. The payments in  kind, such as grain or manual services, from the royal demesnes  had been turned into money payments. This income from royal  estates was also received by the Exchequer and then commingled  with the other funds. Each payment was indicated by notches on a  stick, which was then split so that the payer and the receiver  each had a half showing the notches. The Chancellor managed the  domestic matters of the Crown's castles and lands. Henry brought  sheriffs under his strict control, free from influence by the  barons.    A woman could inherit a fief if she married. The primary way for  a man to acquire land was to marry an heiress. If a man were in  a lower station than she was, he had to pay for his new social  status as well as have royal permission. A man could also be  awarded land which had escheated to the King. If a noble woman  wanted to hold land in her own right, she had to make a payment  to the King. Many widows bought their freedom from guardianship  or remarriage from the King. Women whose husbands were at war  also ran the land of their husbands.    Barons were lords of large holdings of farmland called \"manors\".  Many of the lesser barons left their dark castles to live in  semi-fortified stone houses, which usually were of two rooms  with rug hangings for drafts, as well as the sparse furniture  that had been common to the castle. There were shuttered windows  to allow in light, but which also let in the wind and rain when  open. The roof was of"]]]
