As a rule the red corpuscles are absent from  the lymph, but the white corpuscles are present and in about the same  numbers as in the blood.    The physical properties of the lymph are also similar to those of the  blood. Like the blood, the lymph is denser than water and also coagulates,  but it coagulates more slowly than does the blood. The most noticeable  difference between these liquids is that of color, the lymph being  colorless. This is due to the absence of red corpuscles. The quantity of  lymph is estimated to be considerably greater than that of the blood.    *Lymph Vessels.*--Most of the lymph lies in minute cavities surrounding the  cells and in close relations with the capillaries (Figs. 27 and 30). These  are called _lymph spaces_. Connecting with the lymph spaces on the one  hand, and with certain blood vessels on the other, is a system of tubes  that return the lymph to the blood stream. The smallest of these, and the  ones in greatest abundance, are called _lymphatics_. They consist of  slender, thin-walled tubes, which resemble veins in structure, and, like  the veins, have valves. They differ from veins, however, in being more  uniform in size and in having thinner walls.                                    [Fig. 28]       Fig. 28--*Diagram of drainage system for the lymph.* 1. Thoracic duct. 2.   Right lymphatic duct. 3. Left subclavian vein. 4. Right subclavian vein.   5. Superior vena cava. 6. Lacteals. 7. Lymphatic glands. The small tubes      connecting with the lymph spaces in all parts of the body are the                                 lymphatics.      The lymphatics in different places gradually converge toward, and empty  into, the two main lymph tubes of the body. The smaller of these tubes,  called the _right lymphatic duct_, receives the lymph from the lymphatics  in the right arm, the right side of the head, and the region of the right  shoulder. It connects with, and empties its contents into, the right  subclavian vein at the place where it is joined by the right jugular vein  (Fig. 28).    The larger of the lymph tubes is called the _thoracic duct_. This receives  lymph from all parts of the body not drained by the right lymphatic duct,  and empties it into the left subclavian vein. Connection is made with the  subclavian vein on the upper side at the place where it is joined by the  left jugular vein. The thoracic duct has a length of from sixteen to  eighteen inches, and is about as large around as a goose quill. The lower  end terminates in an enlargement in the abdominal cavity, called the  _receptacle of the chyle_. It is provided with valves throughout its  course, in addition to one of considerable size which guards the opening  into the blood vessel.    The lymphatics which join the thoracic duct from the small intestine are  called the _lacteals_ (Fig. 28). These do not differ in structure from the  lymphatics in other parts of the body, but they perform a special work in  absorbing the digested fat (Chapter XI).    *Lymphatic Glands.*--The lymphatic glands, sometimes called lymph nodes,  are small and somewhat rounded bodies situated along the course of the  lymphatic tubes. They vary in size, some of them being an inch or more in  length. The lymph vessels generally open into them on one side and leave  them on the other (Figs. 28 and 30). They are not glands in function, but  are so called because of their having the general form of glands. They  provide favorable conditions for the development of white corpuscles (page  29). They also separate harmful germs and poisonous wastes from the lymph,  thereby preventing their entrance into the blood.    *Relations of the Lymph, the Blood, and the Cells.*--While the blood is  necessary as a carrying, or transporting, agent in the body, the lymph is  necessary for transferring materials from the blood to the cells and _vice  versa_. Serving as a physiological \"go between,\" or medium of exchange,  the lymph enables the blood to minister to the needs of the cells. But the  lymph and the blood, everything considered, can hardly be looked upon as  two separate and distinct liquids. Not only do they supplement each other  in their work and possess striking similarities, but each is made in its  movements to pass into the vessels occupied by the other, so that they are  constantly mixing and mingling. For these and other reasons, they are more  properly regarded as two divisions of a single liquid--one which, by  adapting itself to different purposes,(27) supplies all the conditions of  a nutrient fluid for the cells.    *Movements of the Lymph.*--As compared with the blood, the lymph must be  classed as a quiet liquid. But, as already suggested, it has certain  movements which are necessary to the purposes which it serves. A careful  study shows it to have three well-defined movements as follows:    1. A movement from the capillaries toward the cells.    2. A movement from the cells toward the capillaries.    3. A movement of the entire body of lymph from the lymph spaces into the  lymphatics and along these channels to the ducts through which it enters  the blood.    By the first movement the cells receive their nourishment. By the second  and third movements the lymph, more or less laden with impurities, is  returned to the blood stream. (See Figs. 28 and 30.)    *Causes of the Lymph Movements.*--Let us consider first the movement  through the lymph tubes. No pump, like the heart, is known to be connected  with these tubes and to supply the pressure necessary for moving the  lymph. There are, however, several forces that indirectly aid in its flow.  The most important of these are as follows:    1. _Blood Pressure at the Capillaries._--The plasma which is forced through  the capillary walls by pressure from the heart makes room for itself by  pushing a portion of the lymph out of the lymph spaces. This in turn  presses upon the lymph in the tubes which it enters. In this way pressure  from the heart is transmitted to the lymph, forcing it to move.    2. _Variable Pressure on the Walls of the Lymph Vessels._--Pressure exerted  on the sides of the lymph tubes by contracting muscles tends to close them  up and to push the lymph past the valves, which, by closing, prevent its  return (Fig. 29). Pressure at the surface of the body, provided that it is  variable, also forces the lymph along. The valves in the lymph vessels  serve the same purpose as those in the veins.                                    [Fig. 29]      Fig. 29--*Diagram* to show how the muscles pump lymph. _A._ Relaxed muscle        beside which is a lymphatic tube. _B._ Same muscle in state of                                 contraction.      3. _The Inspiratory Force._--When the thoracic cavity is enlarged in  breathing, the unbalanced atmospheric pressure is exerted from all  directions towards the thoracic space. This not only causes the air to  flow into the lungs (Chapter VII), but also causes a movement of the blood  and lymph in such of their tubes as enter this cavity. It will be noted  that both of the large lymph ducts terminate where their contents may be  influenced by the respiratory movements. (See Practical Work.)    *Where the Lymph enters the Blood.*--The fact that the lymph is poured into  the blood at but two places, and these very close to each other, requires  a word of explanation. As a matter of fact, it is impossible for the lymph  to flow into blood vessels at most places on account of the blood  pressure. This would force the blood into the lymph vessels, instead of  allowing the lymph to enter the blood. The lymph can enter only at some  place where the blood pressure is less than the pressure that moves the  lymph. Such a place is found in the thoracic cavity. As already pointed  out (page 54), the blood pressure in the veins entering this cavity  becomes, with each expansion of the chest, negative, i.e., less than the  pressure of the atmosphere on the outside of the body. This, as we have  seen, aids in the flow of the blood into the right auricle. It also aids  in the passage of lymph into the blood vessels. The lymph is said to be  \"sucked in,\" which means that it is forced in by the unbalanced pressure  of the atmosphere.(28) Some advantage is also gained by the lymph duct's  entering the subclavian vein on the upper side and at its union with the  jugular vein. Everything considered, it is found that the lymph flows into  the blood vessels where it can be \"drawn in\" by the movements of breathing  and where it meets with no opposition from the blood stream itself (Fig.  30).                                    [Fig. 30]        Fig. 30--*Diagram* showing general movement of lymph from the place of   relatively high pressure at the lymph spaces to the place of relatively                     low pressure in the thoracic cavity.      *Lymph Movements at the Cells.*--The double movement of the lymph from the  capillaries toward the cells and from the cells toward the capillaries is  not entirely understood. Blood pressure in the capillaries undoubtedly has  much to do in forcing the plasma through the capillary walls, but this  tends to prevent the movement of the lymph in the opposite direction.  Movements between the blood and the lymph are known to take place in part  according to a general principle, known as _osmosis_, or dialysis.                                    [Fig. 31]        Fig. 31--*Vessel* with an upright membranous partition for illustrating                                   osmosis.      *Osmosis.*--The term \"osmosis\" is used to designate the passage of liquids  through some partition which separates them. Thus, if a vessel with an  upright membranous partition be filled on the one side with pure water and  on the other with water containing salt, an exchange of materials will  take place through the membrane until the same proportion of salt exists  on the two sides (Fig. 31). The cause of osmosis is the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18790"],[0,"The Insect Folk (#13)"],[1,"front legs.    See, they were folded up, somewhat like the front legs of the mantis,  only these could fold close together, being threadlike.    So the long threads are antennae after all.    Now it has raised its head, which we easily see is quite round, with  tiny eyes, and the antennae are growing out from the front of it.    What is it? A walking stick? A mantis?    [Illustration]    Why! why! There it goes, sailing off in the air with a queer little  fluttering motion of its whole body.    It has wings!    John has caught it and brought it back.    Now let us see those wings, you strange little creature.    You will have to look close, but there they are, narrow, short, such  tiny wings! How _do_ you suppose it flies with them?    You seem queerer and queerer the more we look at you, little  what-shall-we-call-you.    But we know you are not a walking stick because our walking sticks have  no wings.    The truth is you are a--bug!    Yes, this little threadlike creature belongs to the same order as the  big flat giant water bug.    It grasps its victim, in its fore feet like the mantis, but instead of  biting its prey it sucks out the juices.    You would hardly expect such a delicate creature to catch and kill other  insects, yet such is the case.    No, I do not think it will pierce your finger with its beak. I have  often handled them, and have never been stung by one. We often see them  walking about in the grass and along paths.          THE WELL DRESSED LACE BUG    [Illustration: HAWTHORN TWIG.]      IF we pay a visit to that hawthorn bush we shall probably find  a bug to our liking. Yes, here is one.    It is a tiny thing, I know, but wait until you see it under the  microscope.    Ah, I thought you would be pleased!    Nell says it looks as though it had on a lace party dress.    Is it not a dainty fairy!    We call it the lace bug.    It does not suck the juices of other insects, but instead it sucks the  juices of plants.    Its eggs are very curious. It lays them on leaves and glues them fast.  They look like little out-growths of the leaf.    The young lace bugs are like their parents in form, only, of course,  they have no wings and so they are not pretty.    [Illustration]    Fairy lace bug, we are glad to make your acquaintance.          A BAD BUG    [Illustration]      Now, here is a bug we all loathe. It is round and flat, and reddish  brown in color, and it has a disgusting odor.    But though we hate this bug, it is very fond of us. It has a short,  sharp tube folded down under its head, and this tube it likes to raise  up and stick into the skin of people, and suck out their blood.    It has no wings, only a pair of little scales where its wings should be.  Yes, May, these scales are rudimentary wings, and they are good for  nothing. It once had wings, but it preferred to go slipping about in  cracks and hiding in beds, until in course of time no wings grew, which  served it right.    It has antennae and eyes and spiracles; indeed, it has everything a bug  should have but wings and good manners.    We call it the bed bug because its favorite home is in beds, so that it  can sally forth at night and feast upon its sleeping victims.    It lays its eggs in cracks and crevices, and each egg is like a little  jar with a rim and a lid at the top. When the young one hatches it  pushes off the lid. The young are in shape like their parents, only they  are very light colored, and almost transparent. They look like ghosts of  bugs, but they are very voracious ghosts indeed, and they eat and moult  and grow and become darker colored until they reach maturity.    One strange thing about them is that they can live a very long time with  nothing to eat, so that houses long vacated may still contain these  nuisances, that sally forth, eager to round out their emaciated forms at  the expense of the new occupants of the house.    The barn swallow is sadly afflicted by a species of these unwelcome  visitors to its nest, and the poor bats are also victimized by a species  of bed bug.    The bad odor comes from a liquid poured out of the back of young bugs,  and from the under side of old ones.    These insects are very undesirable acquaintances, and they breed so fast  that even one, brought into a house, may cause it to become generally  infested in a few weeks.    Eternal vigilance and great cleanliness are the housekeeper's only  safeguards.    There are some species of bugs that closely resemble the bed bugs, only  they have wings, and live on flowers or in the cracks of the bark of  trees.          THE TROUBLESOME RED BUG    [Illustration]      There are a great many kinds of bugs on the leaves and flowers in  summer, and some of them do much damage by eating the vegetation.    One of the most troublesome of these is the red bug. Here is a picture  of one.    Its wings look as if they had an X drawn on them.    Let us spread out one of the wings.    Why do you all laugh?    Sure enough, Ned, how _can_ we spread out the wings of a bug in a  picture?    [Illustration]    But there is a way out of that difficulty.    Yes, another picture.    Only the upper wings are spread out.    You see, the half of the wing next the body is stiff like a wing cover,  and the other half is thin and silky, and folds up under the stiff part.  When the insect flies it spreads out the under wings, too, for there is  a pair of thin, flying wings folded on the body under these upper wings.    These upper wings, that are half wing cover and half flying wing, are  characteristic of the bug order.    Not all the bugs have them, but a great many have.    The name of the bug order is HEM-IP-TERA, meaning half-wing.  You see why.    Yes, John, the word \"hemiptera\" comes from two Greek words, _hemi_,  meaning half, and, as you know, _pteron_, meaning a wing.    The young red bugs are like the old ones, excepting in color.    What do we call the young of insects, little Nell?    Yes, we call them larvae. These red bug larvae are bright red with black  legs.    They pierce the cotton plants in the South, and suck out the juices.    Of course, they grow and moult until they arrive at the adult form.    What, John? You do not know what \"adult\" means? Adult means \"grown-up.\"    It is a short way of saying grown-up; and after this, when we mean a  grown-up insect, let us say an adult insect.    To return to the red bug. When it reaches the adult state, it is not  such a bright red, but rather of a reddish color with brownish wings  striped with light yellow.    Beside eating the juices of the cotton plants and thus injuring or even  killing them, the red bugs stain the white cotton and spoil it.    They are also troublesome in some parts of Florida, where they pierce  the skins of the oranges, and cause the fruit to decay.    [Illustration]          THE RAVENOUS CHINCH BUGS      There are a great many bugs injurious to vegetation, among them the  little chinch bugs.    They are so small, each one no larger than a plant louse, that you would  not think they could do much harm.    One of them could not, but when they appear in millions, then they are  terrible.    Here is one magnified to show the white wing covers with black markings.    [Illustration]    Would you believe that this tiny insect has destroyed millions of  dollars' worth of grain in the United States?    What, Charlie? you should think they could be killed out? That is a very  difficult task. You see they are so small, and they breed so fast. There  are two broods of them in one year, and when they have eaten one grain  field they start off, millions strong, to another.    Of course a great many methods have been tried for getting rid of them,  and one very curious method you will like to hear about.    You know insects are subject to diseases.    What, Nell, you never heard of a sick bug?    Yet it seems they are sick sometimes, and certain diseases kill them.  Chinch bugs are not as healthy in some places as in others.    There is a contagious disease that kills them off in very great numbers.    Ned says he can guess what remedy the people apply to the healthy chinch  bugs that are eating their grain.    Yes, they introduce diseased chinch bugs into the grain fields with the  healthy ones. The contagion spreads and the bugs die!    There is another way of getting rid of some kinds of troublesome  insects. That is, to introduce an insect not injurious to vegetation,  that will prey upon the injurious ones.          THE WELL PROTECTED STINK BUG      One of the bugs we know the best and like the least is the stink bug.    It deserves its name.    John says he had one on his hand this morning.    How did you like it, John?    Did any of you ever pick berries where these bugs were?    See what a face Mollie is making! It is very evident that _she_ has.    [Illustration: RED RASPBERRY.]    What a nasty taste they give the delicious fruit.    Even the flavor of the red raspberry is spoiled if one of these bugs  pollutes it.    What makes them smell so? May is asking.    The disgusting odor is caused by a liquid that is ejected out of little  pores on the under side of the thorax.    The bug can eject this liquid when it pleases.    Most members of the bug order can eject a disagreeable liquid, though  few of them do it so successfully as the stink bug.    If the stink bug is not disturbed, it does not give forth the bad odor;  but when we jostle the bushes in getting the berries, that startles it,  and we get the benefit of its alarm.    Yes, undoubtedly the bugs make a bad odor for the same reason the  grasshoppers make molasses. They wish to repel their enemies.    Very few birds ever touch a stink bug.    Nell thinks a bird would be crazy to eat a stink bug.    Mollie says if it were not crazy when it began, it surely would be  before it got through!    Not only the bugs make these disagreeable odors.    Many other insects do.    The cockroaches, as we know, and one"]]]
