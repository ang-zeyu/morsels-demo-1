Some  photographers have been led to think that by underexposing they retain  the distance, but they sacrifice the foreground; besides, it does not  produce an orthochromatic effect.    But it is a good idea to expose longer on the foreground than you do  on the distance. This can be done by raising the cap of the lens  skyward and gradually shut off, giving the foreground more exposure.    Plates are prepared for orthochromatic work as follows: Take any  ordinary rapid dry plate, place it in a bath containing      Distilled water                    200 c.c.    Strong liquid ammonia                2 c.c.    Rock it for two minutes, work as dark as you possibly can. Now take it  out, and place it in the second bath for one and one-fourth minutes  and keep it rocking. Have on hand for use a stock solution of      Distilled water                       1,000 parts.    Erythrosine \"Y\" brand                     1 part.    Prepare second bath as follows:      Erythrosine stock solution               25 c.c.    Distilled water                         175 c.c.    Strong water ammonia                      4 c.c.    After removing the plate, dip it again face down to rinse off any  particles of scum, etc., that may get in the bath accidentally. This  bath may be used for one dozen 8 by 10, when it should be thrown away  and fresh bath used.    After the plates come out of the last bath, they should be stood on  clean blotting paper to absorb the excess of solution. I would also  advise to use clean fingers. Pyro. or hypo. on the fingers is a  drawback to success.    After plates have been drained, place them in a cleaned rack in an  absolutely light-tight closet, with air holes so constructed as to  admit air but no light; the plates will dry in from eight to twelve  hours. They are best prepared in the evening, and, if the closet is  good, will be dry in the morning.    After the plates are dry they may be packed face to face with nothing  between them, in a double-cover paper box, and put in a dark closet  free from sulphureted hydrogen gas, until ready for use. I have kept  plates for three months in this way, and they were in good condition.  Great care should be used in developing these plates, as they are  sensitive to the red; get used to developing in a dark part of the  dark room; occasionally you may look at the process of development in  a little stronger light.    The exposure through the yellow screen with an erythrosine plate is  about the same as if you had no orthochromatic plate--a plain plate  instead--provided you are not using too dark a yellow on your screen.  This can only be determined by experience. I will give to a common  plate about four seconds, an orthochromatic plate under the same  conditions five seconds.    The yellow glass screen is prepared as follows: Take a piece of best  plate glass--common cannot be used--clean it nicely; take another  large plate glass, or anything that is level and true, level it with a  small spirit-level. Now take the cleaned piece of glass and coat it  with    AURENTIA COLLODION.      Ether                                  5 oz.    Alcohol                                5 oz.    Cotton                                60 grs.    The aurentia to be added to suit your judgment; it takes a very small  quantity to make an intense yellowish-red collodion. Pour it on the  center of the glass, flow it to the edges, and before it sets place it  on the level glass and allow it to set; when set put it in a rack to  dry.    Should it dry in ridges, the collodion may be too thick, and it must  be thinned down with equal parts of alcohol and ether. A single piece  of plate glass, about one-eighth inch thick, coated with aurentia  collodion, is all that is required with an erythrosine plate. Or,  after a piece has been successfully coated, another piece of the same  plate glass, and the same size, may be cemented together with balsam,  having the coated aurentia side between the two glasses; the edges may  then be bound with paper.    In using different colored solutions, collodion, etc., I have found  that one will change the focus and the other not. With some screens  you must focus with them in their positions; take away the screen, and  the picture appears out of focus. I cannot fully explain why it is,  and for this reason will not make the attempt; experience alone can  teach it.    Another thing that has been tried lately is to do away with the yellow  screen by substituting a yellow coating direct on the plate. No doubt  the focus on an object that requires absolute sharpness is somewhat  affected by the use of a glass. We have been successful, on a small  scale, to coat the plate with the following yellow solution:    Place in a tray enough of a saturated solution of tropaeolin in wood  alcohol to cover the plate; allow it to remain ten seconds. It is  necessary that the plate should be bathed previously in erythrosine  and dried. Before applying the tropaeolin, which, being in alcohol,  dries in a few minutes, have some blotting paper on hand, as the  solution gathers in a pool and leaves bad marks on the end of the  plate.    The plate can be developed in the usual way. Try it and see the  results.--_Reported in the Beacon._           *       *       *       *       *          PLATINOTYPE PRINTING.[1]       [Footnote 1: A communication to the North London Photographic     Society.]      Platinotype, which may be considered to be the most artistic of  photographic printing processes, may be separated into its three  modifications--the hot bath and cold bath, in which a faintly visible  image is developed, and the Pizzighelli printing-out paper. The hot  bath process, again, may be divided into the black and white and sepia  papers. I intend to give you a rough outline of the preparation of the  paper and working of these modifications, concluding by demonstrating  the hot bath method, and handing around prints by it.    Platinotype may almost be styled an iron printing process, for, while  no trace of iron or its salts is found in the finished print, certain  salts of iron are mixed with the platinum salt, which is platinum  combined with two atoms of chlorine (PtCl2), as a means for readily  reducing it; this, however, cannot be effected without the presence of  neutral oxalate of potash, hence the use of the oxalate bath. There is  no platinum in the paper for the cold bath process, it being coated  with ferric oxalate mixed with a very small quantity of chloride of  mercury--somewhere about one grain to an ounce of ferric oxalate  solution. When dry it is ready for exposure, which is about three  times less than with silver printing.    It is absolutely necessary to store all papers for platinum printing  in an air-tight tin containing chloride of calcium, which must be  dried by heating from time to time. For the cold bath, however, it is  important to have moisture present during printing, or it may be after  printing and before development. If the paper is left in a dampish  room for fifteen minutes, it should be sufficient. Prints made by  exposing damp paper, or damping dry paper just before development,  must be developed within one hour if the maximum of vigor is desired;  by delaying the development some hours, the prints in the meantime  being stored in a drawer so that they may retain their moisture, an  increase of half tone and warmth of color will be obtained. If it  should be necessary to delay development for a day or two, the prints  must be dried before a fire soon after being removed from the frames,  and then stored in a calcium tube until wanted for development.    While printing, the lemon color of the paper receives a grayish  colored image, which, although faint, can, with practice, be judged as  easily as silver printing.    The developer consists of oxalate of potash and potassic  chloro-platinite--about thirty grains of the platinum salt to half an  ounce of oxalate forming about six ounces of solution; a great many  variations, however, may be made in the proportions of platinum salt  and oxalate, and different effects secured. Development is effected by  sliding the print face downward on to the developer, which must be  rocked after the development of each print to avoid scum marks. To  clear the prints they are washed in three or four baths of a weak  solution of hydrochloric acid after leaving the developer, to remove  all traces of the iron salts, and finally washed for a quarter of an  hour in three changes of water; they are then finished, and may be  dried between clean blotting paper.    Pizzighelli's process differs from the above in being one that prints  fully out in the frame without development; the paper contains the  platinum and iron salts as well as the developer, and so prints and  develops at the same time. Although excellent prints can be produced  with it, for general work the results of the paper, as at present  made, will not compare with the hot and cold bath processes. It is,  however, excellent for printing from very dense negatives, and  occasional negatives that seem extremely suitable for it. The paper  should be breathed on before printing, as if it is quite dry the  printing will be very slow and irregular. The best conditions for the  preparation of the paper have scarcely been decided upon yet, and it  is not quite fair to judge the process. The prints are cleared in the  acid baths and washed for about a quarter of an hour.    The sepia and black hot bath processes are much alike in the general  treatment. There are, however, some special precautions to be observed  with the sepia paper, the chief being to protect it from any but the  faintest rays of light; the prints, unlike the black ones, may be  affected by light when in the acid bath. A special solution must be  added to the developer to keep"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16983"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Íqán (#13)"],[1,"invariably and specifically referred to that sovereignty with which the  promised Manifestation must needs be invested. This is attested by the  records of the scriptures of the past. This sovereignty hath not been  solely and exclusively attributed to the Qa'im. Nay rather, the attribute  of sovereignty and all other names and attributes of God have been and  will ever be vouchsafed unto all the Manifestations of God, before and  after Him, inasmuch as these Manifestations, as it hath already been  explained, are the Embodiments of the attributes of God, the Invisible,  and the Revealers of the divine mysteries.    Furthermore, by sovereignty is meant the all-encompassing, all-pervading  power which is inherently exercised by the Qa'im whether or not He appear  to the world clothed in the majesty of earthly dominion. This is solely  dependent upon the will and pleasure of the Qa'im Himself. You will  readily recognize that the terms sovereignty, wealth, life, death,  judgment and resurrection, spoken of by the scriptures of old, are not  what this generation hath conceived and vainly imagined. Nay, by  sovereignty is meant that sovereignty which in every dispensation resideth  within, and is exercised by, the person of the Manifestation, the Day-star  of Truth. That sovereignty is the spiritual ascendancy which He exerciseth  to the fullest degree over all that is in heaven and on earth, and which  in due time revealeth itself to the world in direct proportion to its  capacity and spiritual receptiveness, even as the sovereignty of Muhammad,  the Messenger of God, is today apparent and manifest amongst the people.  You are well aware of what befell His Faith in the early days of His  dispensation. What woeful sufferings did the hand of the infidel and  erring, the divines of that age and their associates, inflict upon that  spiritual Essence, that most pure and holy Being! How abundant the thorns  and briars which they have strewn over His path! It is evident that  wretched generation, in their wicked and satanic fancy, regarded every  injury to that immortal Being as a means to the attainment of an abiding  felicity; inasmuch as the recognized divines of that age, such as  'Abdu'llah-i-Ubayy, Abu-'Amir, the hermit, Ka'b-Ibn-i-Ashraf, and  Nadr-Ibn-i-Harith, all treated Him as an impostor, and pronounced Him a  lunatic and a calumniator. Such sore accusations they brought against Him  that in recounting them God forbiddeth the ink to flow, Our pen to move,  or the page to bear them. These malicious imputations provoked the people  to arise and torment Him. And how fierce that torment if the divines of  the age be its chief instigators, if they denounce Him to their followers,  cast Him out from their midst, and declare Him a miscreant! Hath not the  same befallen this Servant, and been witnessed by all?    For this reason did Muhammad cry out: \"No Prophet of God hath suffered  such harm as I have suffered.\" And in the Qur'an are recorded all the  calumnies and reproaches uttered against Him, as well as all the  afflictions which He suffered. Refer ye thereunto, that haply ye may be  informed of that which hath befallen His Revelation. So grievous was His  plight, that for a time all ceased to hold intercourse with Him and His  companions. Whoever associated with Him fell a victim to the relentless  cruelty of His enemies.    We shall cite in this connection only one verse of that Book. Shouldst  thou observe it with a discerning eye, thou wilt, all the remaining days  of thy life, lament and bewail the injury of Muhammad, that wronged and  oppressed Messenger of God. That verse was revealed at a time when  Muhammad languished weary and sorrowful beneath the weight of the  opposition of the people, and of their unceasing torture. In the midst of  His agony, the Voice of Gabriel, calling from the Sadratu'l-Muntaha, was  heard saying: \"But if their opposition be grievous to Thee--if Thou canst,  seek out an opening into the earth or a ladder into heaven.\"(78) The  implication of this utterance is that His case had no remedy, that they  would not withhold their hands from Him unless He should hide Himself  beneath the depths of the earth, or take His flight unto heaven.    Consider, how great is the change today! Behold, how many are the  Sovereigns who bow the knee before His name! How numerous the nations and  kingdoms who have sought the shelter of His shadow, who bear allegiance to  His Faith, and pride themselves therein! From the pulpit-top there  ascendeth today the words of praise which, in utter lowliness, glorify His  blessed name; and from the heights of minarets there resoundeth the call  that summoneth the concourse of His people to adore Him. Even those Kings  of the earth who have refused to embrace His Faith and to put off the  garment of unbelief, none the less confess and acknowledge the greatness  and overpowering majesty of that Day-star of loving kindness. Such is His  earthly sovereignty, the evidences of which thou dost on every side  behold. This sovereignty must needs be revealed and established either in  the lifetime of every Manifestation of God or after His ascension unto His  true habitation in the realms above. What thou dost witness today is but a  confirmation of this truth. That spiritual ascendency, however, which is  primarily intended, resideth within, and revolveth around Them from  eternity even unto eternity. It can never for a moment be divorced from  Them. Its dominion hath encompassed all that is in heaven and on earth.    The following is an evidence of the sovereignty exercised by Muhammad, the  Day-star of Truth. Hast thou not heard how with one single verse He hath  sundered light from darkness, the righteous from the ungodly, and the  believing from the infidel? All the signs and allusions concerning the Day  of Judgment, which thou hast heard, such as the raising of the dead, the  Day of Reckoning, the Last Judgment, and others have been made manifest  through the revelation of that verse. These revealed words were a blessing  to the righteous who on hearing them exclaimed: \"O God our Lord, we have  heard, and obeyed.\" They were a curse to the people of iniquity who, on  hearing them affirmed: \"We have heard and rebelled.\" Those words, sharp as  the sword of God, have separated the faithful from the infidel, and  severed father from son. Thou hast surely witnessed how they that have  confessed their faith in Him and they that rejected Him have warred  against each other, and sought one another's property. How many fathers  have turned away from their sons; how many lovers have shunned their  beloved! So mercilessly trenchant was this wondrous sword of God that it  cleft asunder every relationship! On the other hand, consider the welding  power of His Word. Observe, how those in whose midst the Satan of self had  for years sown the seeds of malice and hate became so fused and blended  through their allegiance to this wondrous and transcendent Revelation that  it seemed as if they had sprung from the same loins. Such is the binding  force of the Word of God, which uniteth the hearts of them that have  renounced all else but Him, who have believed in His signs, and quaffed  from the Hand of glory the Kawthar of God's holy grace. Furthermore, how  numerous are those peoples of divers beliefs, of conflicting creeds, and  opposing temperaments, who, through the reviving fragrance of the Divine  springtime, breathing from the Ridvan of God, have been arrayed with the  new robe of divine Unity, and have drunk from the cup of His singleness!    This is the significance of the well-known words: \"The wolf and the lamb  shall feed together.\"(79) Behold the ignorance and folly of those who,  like the nations of old, are still expecting to witness the time when  these beasts will feed together in one pasture! Such is their low estate.  Methinks, never have their lips touched the cup of understanding, neither  have their feet trodden the path of justice. Besides, of what profit would  it be to the world were such a thing to take place? How well hath He  spoken concerning them: \"Hearts have they, with which they understand not,  and eyes have they with which they see not!\"(80)    Consider how with this one verse which hath descended from the heaven of  the Will of God, the world and all that is therein have been brought to a  reckoning with Him. Whosoever acknowledged His truth and turned unto Him,  his good works outweighed his misdeeds, and all his sins were remitted and  forgiven. Thereby is the truth of these words concerning Him made  manifest: \"Swift is He in reckoning.\" Thus God turneth iniquity into  righteousness, were ye to explore the realms of divine knowledge, and  fathom the mysteries of His wisdom. In like manner, whosoever partook of  the cup of love, obtained his portion of the ocean of eternal grace and of  the showers of everlasting mercy, and entered into the life of faith--the  heavenly and everlasting life. But he that turned away from that cup was  condemned to eternal death. By the terms \"life\" and \"death,\" spoken of in  the scriptures, is intended the life of faith and the death of unbelief.  The generality of the people, owing to their failure to grasp the meaning  of these words, rejected and despised the person of the Manifestation,  deprived themselves of the light of His divine guidance, and refused to  follow the example of that immortal Beauty.    When the light of Qur'anic Revelation was kindled within the chamber of  Muhammad's holy heart, He passed upon the people the verdict of the Last  Day, the verdict of resurrection, of judgment, of life, and of death.  Thereupon the standards of revolt were hoisted, and the doors of derision  opened. Thus hath He, the Spirit of God, recorded, as spoken by the  infidels: \"And if thou shouldst say, 'After death ye shall surely be  raised again,' the infidels will certainly exclaim, 'This is nothing"]]]
