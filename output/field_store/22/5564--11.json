As Steele had abandoned his search, I had nothing to do now but let the  others decide what disposition was to be made of Snecker.    \"Wright, what'll you do with him?\" I queried, as if uncertain, now the  capture was made. I let Snecker go and sheathed my weapon.    That seemed a signal for him to come to life. I guessed he had not much  fancied the wide and somewhat variable sweep of that cocked gun.    \"I'll see to that,\" replied Wright gruffly, and he pushed Snecker in  front of him into the hall. I followed them out into the court at the  back of the house.    As I had very little further curiosity I did not wait to see where they  went, but hurried back to relieve Miss Sampson and Sally.    I found them as I had left them--Sally quiet, pale, Miss Sampson nervous  and distressed. I soon calmed their fears of any further trouble or  possible disturbance. Miss Sampson then became curious and wanted to  know who the rustler was.    \"How strange he should come here,\" she said several times.    \"Probably he'd run this way or thought he had a better chance to hide  where there was dancing and confusion,\" I replied glibly.    I wondered how much longer I would find myself keen to shunt her mind  from any channel leading to suspicion.    \"Would papa have arrested him?\" she asked.    \"Colonel Sampson might have made it hot for him,\" I replied frankly,  feeling that if what I said had a double meaning it still was no lie.    \"Oh, I forgot--the Ranger!\" she exclaimed suddenly. \"That awful  sight--the whole front of him bloody! Russ, how could he stand up under  such a wound? Do you think it'll kill him?\"    \"That's hard to say. A man like Steele can stand a lot.\"    \"Russ, please go find him! See how it is with him!\" she said, almost  pleadingly.    I started, glad of the chance and hurried down toward the town.    There was a light in the little adobe house where he lived, and  proceeding cautiously, so as to be sure no one saw me, I went close and  whistled low in a way he would recognize. Then he opened the door and I  went in.    \"Hello, son!\" he said. \"You needn't have worried. Sling a blanket over  that window so no one can see in.\"    He had his shirt off and had been in the act of bandaging a wound that  the bullet had cut in his shoulder.    \"Let me tie that up,\" I said, taking the strips of linen. \"Ahuh! Shot  you from behind, didn't he?\"    \"How else, you locoed lady-charmer? It's a wonder I didn't have to tell  you that.\"    \"Tell me about it.\"    Steele related a circumstance differing little from other attempts at  his life, and concluded by saying that Snecker was a good runner if he  was not a good shot.    I finished the bandaging and stood off, admiring Steele's magnificent  shoulders. I noted, too, on the fine white skin more than one scar made  by bullets. I got an impression that his strength and vitality were like  his spirit--unconquerable!    \"So you knew it was Bill Snecker's son?\" I asked when I had told him  about finding the rustler.    \"Sure. Jim Hoden pointed him out to me yesterday. Both the Sneckers are  in town. From now on we're going to be busy, Russ.\"    \"It can't come too soon for me,\" I replied. \"Shall I chuck my job? Come  out from behind these cowboy togs?\"    \"Not yet. We need proof, Russ. We've got to be able to prove things.  Hang on at the ranch yet awhile.\"    \"This Bo Snecker was scared stiff till he recognized Wright. Isn't that  proof?\"    \"No, that's nothing. We've got to catch Sampson and Wright red-handed.\"    \"I don't like the idea of you trailing along alone,\" I protested.  \"Remember what Neal told me. I'm to kick. It's time for me to hang round  with a couple of guns. You'll never use one.\"    \"The hell I won't,\" he retorted, with a dark glance of passion. I was  surprised that my remark had angered him. \"You fellows are all wrong. I  know _when_ to throw a gun. You ought to remember that Rangers have a  bad name for wanting to shoot. And I'm afraid it's deserved.\"    \"Did you shoot at Snecker?\" I queried.    \"I could have got him in the back. But that wouldn't do. I shot three  times at his legs--tried to let him down. I'd have made him tell  everything he knew, but he ran. He was too fast for me.\"    \"Shooting at his legs! No wonder he ran. He savvied your game all right.  It's funny, Vaughn, how these rustlers and gunmen don't mind being  killed. But to cripple them, rope them, jail them--that's hell to them!  Well, I'm to go on, up at the ranch, falling further in love with that  sweet kid instead of coming out straight to face things with you?\"    Steele had to laugh, yet he was more thoughtful of my insistence.    \"Russ, you think you have patience, but you don't know what patience is.  I won't be hurried on this job. But I'll tell you what: I'll hang under  cover most of the time when you're not close to me. See? That can be  managed. I'll watch for you when you come in town. We'll go in the same  places. And in case I get busy you can stand by and trail along after  me. That satisfy you?\"    \"Fine!\" I said, both delighted and relieved. \"Well, I'll have to rustle  back now to tell Miss Sampson you're all right.\"    Steele had about finished pulling on a clean shirt, exercising care not  to disarrange the bandages; and he stopped short to turn squarely and  look at me with hungry eyes.    \"Russ, did she--show sympathy?\"    \"She was all broken up about it. Thought you were going to die.\"    \"Did she send you?\"    \"Sure. And she said hurry,\" I replied.    I was not a little gleeful over the apparent possibility of Steele being  in the same boat with me.    \"Do you think she would have cared if--if I had been shot up bad?\"    The great giant of a Ranger asked this like a boy, hesitatingly, with  color in his face.    \"Care! Vaughn, you're as thickheaded as you say I'm locoed. Diane  Sampson has fallen in love with you! That's all. Love at first sight!  She doesn't realize it. But I know.\"    There he stood as if another bullet had struck him, this time straight  through the heart. Perhaps one had--and I repented a little of my  overconfident declaration.    Still, I would not go back on it. I believed it.    \"Russ, for God's sake! What a terrible thing to say!\" he ejaculated  hoarsely.    \"No. It's not terrible to _say_ it--only the fact is terrible,\" I went  on. I may be wrong. But I swear I'm right. When you opened your coat,  showed that bloody breast--well, I'll never forget her eyes.    \"She had been furious. She showed passion--hate. Then all in a second  something wonderful, beautiful broke through. Pity, fear, agonized  thought of your death! If that's not love, if--if she did not betray  love, then I never saw it. She thinks she hates you. But she loves you.\"    \"Get out of here,\" he ordered thickly.    I went, not forgetting to peep out at the door and to listen a moment,  then I hurried into the open, up toward the ranch.    The stars were very big and bright, so calm, so cold, that it somehow  hurt me to look at them. Not like men's lives, surely!    What had fate done to Vaughn Steele and to me? I had a moment of  bitterness, an emotion rare with me.    Most Rangers put love behind them when they entered the Service and  seldom found it after that. But love had certainly met me on the way,  and I now had confirmation of my fear that Vaughn was hard hit.    Then the wildness, the adventurer in me stirred to the wonder of it all.  It was in me to exult even in the face of fate. Steele and I, while  balancing our lives on the hair-trigger of a gun, had certainly fallen  into a tangled web of circumstances not calculated in the role of  Rangers.    I went back to the ranch with regret, remorse, sorrow knocking at my  heart, but notwithstanding that, tingling alive to the devilish  excitement of the game.    I knew not what it was that prompted me to sow the same seed in Diane  Sampson's breast that I had sown in Steele's; probably it was just a  propensity for sheer mischief, probably a certainty of the truth and a  strange foreshadowing of a coming event.    If Diane Sampson loved, through her this event might be less tragic.  Somehow love might save us all.    That was the shadowy portent flitting in the dark maze of my mind.    At the ranch dancing had been resumed. There might never have been any  interruption of the gaiety. I found Miss Sampson on the lookout for me  and she searched my face with eyes that silenced my one last qualm of  conscience.    \"Let's go out in the patio,\" I suggested. \"I don't want any one to hear  what I say.\"    Outside in the starlight she looked white and very beautiful. I felt her  tremble. Perhaps my gravity presaged the worst. So it did in one  way--poor Vaughn!    \"I went down to Steele's 'dobe, the little place where he lives.\" I  began, weighing my words. \"He let me in--was surprised. He had been shot  high in the shoulder, not a dangerous wound. I bandaged it for him. He  was grateful--said he had no friends.\"    \"Poor fellow! Oh, I'm glad it--it isn't bad,\" said Miss Sampson.  Something glistened in her eyes.    \"He looked strange, sort of forlorn. I think your words--what you said  hurt him more than the bullet. I'm sure of that, Miss Sampson.\"    \"Oh, I saw that myself! I was furious. But I--I meant what I said.\"    \"You wronged Steele. I happen to know. I know his record along the Rio  Grande. It's scarcely my place, Miss Sampson, to tell you what you'll  find out for yourself, sooner or later.\"    \"What shall I find out?\" she demanded.    \"I've said enough.\"    \"No. You mean my father and cousin George are misinformed or wrong about  Steele? I've feared it this last hour. It was his look. That pierced me.  Oh, I'd hate to be unjust. You say I wronged him, Russ? Then you take  sides with him against my father?\"    \"Yes,\" I replied very low.    She was keenly hurt and seemed, despite an effort, to shrink from me.    \"It's only natural you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15586"],[0,"India, Old and New (#13)"],[1,"Hindu and Mahomedan  conceptions in many other domains than that of architecture? Even if the  Arabs did not originate the pointed arch, it has always been one of the  most beautiful and characteristic features of Mahomedan architecture.  The Hindu, on the other hand, has never built any such arch except  under compulsion.    To unite India under Mahomedan rule and attempt to bridge the gulf that  divided the alien race of Mahomedan conquerors from the conquered Hindus  required more stedfast hands and a loftier genius than those Mahomedan  _condottieri_ possessed. A new power more equal to the task was already  storming at the northern gates of India. On a mound thirty-five miles  north of Delhi, near the old bed of the Jumna, there still stands a  small town which has thrice given its name to one of those momentous  battles that decide the fate of nations. It is Panipat. There, on April  21, 1526, Baber the Lion, fourth in descent from Timur, overthrew the  last of the Lodis. Like his terrible ancestor, he had fought his way  down from Central Asia at the head of a great army of Tartar horsemen;  but, unlike Timur, he fought not for mere plunder and slaughter, but for  empire. He has left us in his own memoirs an incomparable picture of his  remarkable and essentially human personality, and it was his  statesmanship as much as his prowess that laid the rough foundations  upon which the genius of his grandson Akbar was to rear the great fabric  of the Moghul Empire as it was to stand for two centuries. Though it was  at Delhi that, three days after the battle of Panipat, Baber proclaimed  himself Emperor, no visible monument of his reign is to be seen there  to-day. But the white marble dome and lofty walls and terraces of his  son Humayun's mausoleum, raised on a lofty platform out of a sea of dark  green foliage, are, next to the Kutub Minar, the most conspicuous  feature in the plain of Delhi. Endowed with many brilliant and amiable  qualities, Humayun was not made of the same stuff as either his father  or his son. Driven out of India by the Afghans, whom Baber had defeated  but not subdued, he had, it is true, in a great measure reconquered it,  when a fall from the top of the terraced roof of his palace at Delhi  caused his death at the early age of forty-eight. But would he have  been able to retain it? He had by no means crushed the forces of  rebellion which the usurper Sher Shah had united against Moghul rule,  and which were still holding the field under the leadership of the  brilliant Hindu adventurer Hemu. Delhi itself was lost within a few  months of Humayun's death, and it was again at Panipat, just thirty  years after his grandfather's brilliant victory, that the boy Akbar had  in his turn to fight for the empire of Hindustan. He too fought and won,  and when he entered Delhi on the very next day, the empire was his to  mould and to fashion at the promptings of his genius.    Akbar was not yet fourteen, but, precocious even for the East, he was  already a student and a thinker as well as an intrepid fighter. He  showed whither his meditations were leading him as soon as he took the  reins of government into his own hands. There had been great conquerors  before him in India, men of his own race and creed--the blood of Timur  flowed in his veins--and men of other races and of other creeds. They  too had founded dynasties and built up empires, but their dynasties had  passed away, their empires had crumbled to pieces. What was the reason?  Was it not that they had established their dominion on force alone, and  that when force ceased to be vitalised by their own great personalities  their dominion, having struck no root in the soil, withered away and  perished? Akbar, far ahead of his times, determined to try another and a  better way by seeking the welfare of the populations he subdued, by  dispensing equal justice to all races and creeds, by courting loyal  service from Hindus as well as Mahomedans, by giving them a share on  terms of complete equality in the administration of the country, by  breaking down the social barriers between them, even those which hedge  in the family. He was a soldier, and he knew when and how to use force,  but he never used force alone. He subdued the Rajput states, but he won  the allegiance of their princes and himself took a consort from among  their daughters. With their help he reduced the independent Mahomedan  kings of Middle India, from Gujerat in the West to Bengal in the East.  He created a homogeneous system of civil administration which our own  still in many respects resembles, the revenue system especially, which  was based on ancient Hindu custom, having survived with relatively  slight modifications to the present day.    Political uniformity had been achieved, at least over a very large area  of India. A great stride had been made towards real unity and social  fusion. Nevertheless Akbar felt that, so long as the fierce religious  exclusivism of Islam on the one hand, and the rigidity of the Hindu  caste system on the other, were not fundamentally modified there could  be no security for the future against the revival of the old and  deep-seated antagonism between the two races and creeds. He was himself  learned in Islamic doctrine; he caused some of the Brahmanical sacred  books to be translated into Persian--the cultured language of his  court--so that he could study them for himself; and he invited  Christians and Zoroastrians, as well as Hindus and Mahomedans of  different schools of thought, to confer with him and discuss in his  presence the relative merits of their religious systems. The deserted  palaces of Fatehpur Sikri, which he planned out and built with all his  characteristic energy as a royal residence, only about twenty-two miles  distant from the imperial city of Agra, still stand in a singularly  perfect state of preservation that enables one to reconstruct with  exceptional vividness the life of the splendid court over which the  greatest of the Moghul Emperors--the contemporary of our own great Queen  Elizabeth--presided during perhaps the most characteristic years of his  long reign. Within the enceinte of his palace were grouped the chief  offices of the State, the Treasury, the Record Office, the Council  Chamber, the Audience Hall, some of them monuments of architectural  skill and of decorative taste, more often bearing the impress of Hindu  than of Mahomedan inspiration. For his first wife, Sultana Rakhina, who  was also his first cousin, Akbar built the Jodh Bai palace, whilst over  against it, in the beautiful \"Golden House,\" dwelt his Rajput consort,  Miriam-uz-Zemani, who bore him the future Emperor Jehanghir. Nor did he  forget his favourite friends and counsellors. Upon no building in  Fatehpur has such a wealth of exquisite ornamentation been lavished as  upon the dainty palace of Raja Birbal, the most learned and illustrious  Hindu, who gave his spiritual as well as his political allegiance to  Akbar. The Mahomedan brothers Abul Fazl and Faizi, whose conversation,  untrammelled by orthodoxy, so largely influenced his religious  evolution, had their house close to the great mosque, sacred to the  memory of a Mahomedan saint who, according to popular legend, sacrificed  the life of his own infant son in order that Akbar's should live. In the  great hall of the Ibadat Khaneh, built by him for the purpose, Akbar  himself took part in the disputations of learned men of all  denominations in search of religious truth. The spirit which inspired  Akbar during that period of his life breathes nowhere more deeply than  in one of the inscriptions which he chose for the \"Gate of Victory,\" the  lofty portal, perhaps the most splendid in India, leading up to the  spacious mosque quadrangle: \"Jesus, on whom be peace, said: 'The world  is a bridge. Pass over it, but build not upon it. The world endures but  an hour; spend that hour in devotion.'\"    It was at Fatehpur that Akbar sought to set the seal upon his conquests  in peace and in war by evolving from a comparative study of all the  religions of his empire some permanent remedy for the profound  denominational and racial discords by which, unless he could heal them,  he foresaw that his life's work would assuredly some day be wrecked. Did  he despair of any remedy unless he took the spiritual law, as he had  already taken the civil law, into his own hands? Or was even as noble a  mind as his not proof against the overweening _hubris_ to which a  despotic genius has so often succumbed? One momentous evening, in the  Hall of Disputations, he caused, or allowed, his devoted friend and  confidant, Abul Fazl, to proclaim the Emperor's infallibility in the  domain of faith. From claiming the right to explain away the Koran,  which is the corner-stone of Islam, its alpha and omega, to repudiating  it altogether, there was but a short step. Akbar very soon took it. He  promulgated a new religion, which he called the Din-i-Ilahi, and a new  profession of faith, which, instead of the old Islamic formula, \"There  is no God but God, and Mahomed is his prophet,\" proclaimed indeed in the  same words the unity of God, but declared Akbar to be the one Viceregent  of God. The new religion, theistic in doctrine, not only borrowed its  prayers chiefly from the Parsees and its ritual from the Hindus, but  practically abolished all Mahomedan observances. The orthodox Mahomedans  naturally held up their hands in horror, and many preferred honourable  exile to conformity. But the awe which Akbar inspired, and perhaps the  acknowledged elevation of his motives, generally compelled at least  outward acceptance during his lifetime. His Mahomedan subjects had,  moreover, to admit that his desire to conciliate Hinduism did not blind  him to its most perverse features. Whilst he abolished the capitation  tax on Hindus and the tax upon Hindu pilgrims, he forbade infant  marriages and, short of"]]]
