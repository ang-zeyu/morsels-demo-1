By quickly raising the tongue toward the back, it  is taken out of the way of the larynx, and the mass of the tongue is  cleared from the throat. In the middle range, where the tongue or the  larynx might be too high or too low, the furrow, which is of so much  importance, is formed, in order to lead the vocalized breath first  against the front of the palate beneath the nose, then slowly along  the nose and behind it. Then when the highest point (the peak, which  is extremely extensible) is reached, the pillars of the fauces are  lowered, in order to leave the way for the head tones to the head  cavities entirely free. In doing this, the sides of the tongue are  raised high. Every tongue should occupy only so much space as it can  occupy without being a hindrance to the tone.    The bad, bad tongue! one is too thick, another too thin, a third too  long, a fourth much too short.    _Ladies and gentlemen, these are nothing but the excuses of the  lazy!_    [Illustration: Red lines denote that with the inspiration of breath:  I, the diaphragm is sensibly stretched backward; II, enlarges the  capacity of the chest by the drawing down of its floor; III, and so  forms the supply chamber for the breath; IV, indicates the pressure of  the breath against the chest tension muscles; V, the attack.]          SECTION XXIII    PREPARATION FOR SINGING      No one can sing properly without first preparing for it, mentally and  physically, with all the organs concerned in the production of the  voice.    We have in this to perform three functions, simultaneously:--    _First_, to draw breath quietly, not too deeply; to force the breath  against the chest and hold it there firmly till the upward and outward  streaming--that is, singing--begins. (See plate, The Path of the  Breath.)    _Second_, to raise the soft palate at the same time toward the nose,  so that the breath remains stationary until the singing begins.    _Third_, to jerk the tongue backward at the same time, its back being  thus raised, and elastic, ready to meet all the wishes of the  singer,--that is, the needs of the larynx. The larynx must not be  pressed either too low or too high, but must work freely. The breath  is enabled to stream forth from it like a column, whose form is  moulded above the larynx by the base of the tongue.    When these three functions have been performed, all is ready. Now the  pitch of the tone is to be considered, as the singing begins.    The consummation (Hoehepunkt) of the tone, above the palate, gives the  point of attack itself, under the palate.    Now further care must be given that the point of attack on the  palate--that is, the focal point of the breath--be not subjected to  pressure, and that the entire supply of breath be not expended upon  the palatal resonance.    For this the palate must remain elastic, for it has a twofold duty to  perform. It must not only furnish resistance for the focal point of  the breath,--except in the very highest head tones,--around which it  can be diffused; the same resistance, which stands against the stream  of breath from below, must also afford a firm, pliant, and elastic  floor for the overtones, which, soaring above the palate, shift, as is  needed, to or above the hard and soft palate, or are divided in the  nose, forehead, and head cavities. It can easily be seen how any  pressure in singing can be dangerous everywhere, and how careful the  singer is forced to be to avoid such mistakes.          SECTION XXIV    THE POSITION OF THE MOUTH (CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES OF SPEECH)      What must my sensations be with the muscles of speech? How shall I  control them?    The best position of the mouth, the means of securing the proper use  of the muscles of speech and of the vocal organs, is established by  pronouncing the vowel _[=a]_, not too sharply, in the middle range of  the voice, and trying to retain the position of the muscles after the  sound has ceased.    This cannot be done without a _smiling_ position of the mouth,  consequently with a strong contraction of the muscles of the mouth,  tongue, and throat, which can be felt to be drawn up as far as the  ears.    In doing so the tongue--as far as the tip--lies of a pretty nearly  even height to the back [Illustration], the soft palate soars without  arching, but rather somewhat depressed over it.    In pronouncing the vowels _[=a]_ and _[=e]_, the bright vowels, the  full stream of the breath, in the given position, can only partly pass  between the tongue and the palate. The other part is forced--unless  the larynx stands too high and can choke it off--above the palate into  the nasal cavities, to seek its opportunity for resonance.    The path for _[=a]_ and _[=e]_ above the palate is worthy of all  attention as a place for the overtones of the middle voice. If the  soft palate, in the lower middle tones, is forced too far toward the  hard palate, the covered tones are without vibrancy. One must needs  secure the help of the nose especially, when the palate is sunk  beneath the nose, by inflating the nostrils and letting air stream in  and out of them.    I repeat the warning, not to force several tones upon the same  resonating point, but to see that upon each tone the form necessary  for succeeding tones is prepared. Neglect of this will sooner or later  be paid for dearly.    Notwithstanding the strong muscular contraction that the vocal organs  must undergo in pronouncing the vowel _[=a]_, the breath must be able  to flow gently and without hindrance through its form, in order  completely to fill up its resonance chambers. Again, and always,  attention must be given that in singing, and in speaking as well,  nothing shall be cramped or held tense, except the pressure of the  breath against the chest. It is of the utmost importance to maintain  this position for _all_ vowels, with the least possible perceptible  modifications.    How can this be done? _A_ and _e_ are bright vowels, must be sung with  a pleasant, almost smiling, position of the mouth. _U_ and _o_, on the  contrary, are dark vowels, for which the lips must be drawn into a  sort of spout. Look at the position of the throat in these vowels: (1)  as they are usually sung and spoken; (2) as I feel it, in singing, as  I sing them, and as they must be sung and felt.          SECTION XXV    CONNECTION OF VOWELS      How do I connect them with each other? If I wish to connect closely  together two vowels that lie near to or far from each other, I must  first establish the muscular contractions for _[=a]_, and introduce  between the two vowels, whether they lie near together or far apart, a  very well-defined _y_. Then (supposing, for instance, that I want to  connect _[=a]_ and _[=e]_) I must join the _[=a]_ closely to the _y_,  and the _y_ closely to the _[=e]_, so that there is not the least  resonating space between the two that is not filled during the changes  in the position of the organs, however carefully this is undertaken.  There must be no empty space, no useless escape of breath, between any  two of the sounds.    [Illustration:    oo [=e] o [=a] ah    oo o [=e] y ah y [=a] y]    [Illustration:    Bad. oo [=e] o [=a] ah    Good. oo o [=e] ah [=a]]    [Illustration:    Wrong. oo [=e] o [=a] ah    Right. oo o [=e] ah [=a]]    At first only two, then three and four, and then all the vowels in  succession must be so practised:--    _A-ye, a-ye-yu, a-ye-yoo-yue, a-ye-yo-yue-yu-ye-yah._    But there must be never more than so much breath at hand as is needed  to make the vowel and the tone perfect. The more closely the vowels  are connected with the help of the _y_, the less breath is emitted  from the mouth unused, the more intimate is the connection of tone,  and the less noticeable are the changes of the position of the organs  in relation to each other.    When I pass from _y[=a]-y[=e]_ to _yoo_, I am compelled to develop  very strongly the muscular contraction of the lips, which are formed  into a long projecting spout; and this movement cannot be sufficiently  exaggerated. With every new _y_ I must produce renewed muscular  contractions of the vocal organs, which gradually, through continuous  practice, are trained to become almost like the finest, most pliable  steel, upon which the fullest reliance may be placed. From _yoo_ it  is best to go to _yue_, that lies still farther forward and requires of  the lips an iron firmness; then to _yo_, touching slightly on the _e_  that lies above the _o_; then return to _y[=a]_, and not till then  going to _ye-ah_, which must then feel thus:--        e  oo-o ah-[=a]      y    The _y_ is taken under the _ah_, that the word may not slide under;  for usually the thought of _ah_ relaxes all the organs: the tongue  lies flat, the larynx becomes unsteady, is without definite position,  and the palate is not arched and is without firmness. In this way _ah_  becomes the most colorless and empty vowel of the whole list.    With every change of vowel, or of any other letter, there are changes  in the position of the organs, since tongue, palate, and larynx must  take different positions for different sounds.    With _[=a]_ and _[=e]_ the larynx stands higher, the palate is sunk,  or in its normal position.    With _oo_, _o_, and _ah_ the larynx stands low, the palate is arched.    With _a_, _e_, and _ah_ the lips are drawn back.    With _oo_, _o_, _ue_, and _oe_ they are extended far forward.    The auxiliary sound _y_ connects them all with each other, so that the  transitions are made quite imperceptibly. Since it is pronounced with  the tongue drawn high against the palate, it prevents the base of the  tongue from falling down again.    This should be practised very slowly, that the sensations may be  clearly discerned, and that no vibration that gives the vowel its  pitch and duration may escape attention.    The muscular contraction described comprises the chief"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19138"],[0,"Resonance in Singing and Speaking (#13)"],[1,"when he  would wish them hidden. Mental conditions tinged with impatience, with  fear, or with anything that begets tension of any sort are reflected  instantly in the voice, robbing it of its better qualities and  inducing stiffness in the throat.    Reduced to its lowest terms voice culture to-day is a struggle with  throat stiffness.    The causes indicate the remedy. Foremost, then, is dropping all throat  consciousness, all thought of the throat, all drawing of attention to  it. The larynx must be left uncramped, unhindered to do its work in  free unconsciousness, which it will do if not disturbed by tension in  its neighborhood, or by misdirected thought.    The stream of consciousness must in singing be directed to the  breathing which is below the throat, and to resonance and  pronunciation which are above it. These functions are more or less  consciously controlled until at last mastery makes their action  automatic.    I would once more emphasize the fact that the free use of all the  resonance chambers, and the recognition of the great function of  resonance, will do more than anything else to set the voice free and  emancipate the singer from all interfering rigidity.          CHAPTER X    SOME GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS      THE NATURAL VOICE    Pupils are constantly urged to sing and speak naturally, because the  \"natural\" tone is correct. This is exceedingly indefinite. It is  natural for a child to imitate the first sound it hears, whether it be  correct or incorrect. In either case the child imitates it, and for  that child it becomes the natural tone. The child reared in the  wilderness, beyond the hearing of a human voice, will imitate the  notes of the whip-poor-will, the chatter of the monkey, and the hoot  of the owl, and for him they are natural tones.    To be natural is the hardest lesson to learn and it is only the result  of imitation or prolonged discipline. Untrained naturalness is the  perfection of awkwardness. The involuntary functions of organic life  are the only ones naturally performed correctly. Nature's method of  breathing, circulation, and digestion can be depended upon until  disarranged by subsequent conditions, but unless proper vocalization  is established by imitation and discipline this function is sure to be  corrupted by false examples.      AGE TO BEGIN    After the child begins to talk, the sooner his vocal education begins  the better. Even at that early age he can be made to understand the  merits of head vibrations and by simple exercises produce them, and  once taught will never forget them. Vocalizing, like every other art,  is most easily learned by imitation, and the advantage of the early  years, when that faculty is most active, should not be lost. In olden  times the importance of this was fully realized. More than three  centuries ago, old Roger Ascham wrote: \"All languages, both learned  and mother tongues, are begotten and gotten solely by imitation. For  as ye used to hear so ye learn to speak. If ye hear no other, ye speak  not yourself; and of whom ye only hear, of them ye only learn.\"  Nineteen centuries ago Quintillian wrote: \"Before all let the nurses  speak properly. The boy will hear them first and will try to shape his  words by imitating them.\"    If the right way of using the voice is early taught it will be a guard  against the contraction of bad habits which can only be corrected  later with infinite trouble. It certainly would be unwise to put a  young child under continued training; but even in the kindergarten the  right method of voice production can and should be taught. Teachers of  kindergarten and primary schools should be familiar with the  principles of voice training and be able to start the pupils at once  on the right road.      IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS    The sooner this branch of education is made a part of the curriculum  of our common schools, the sooner shall we produce a race of good  speakers and singers.    If, during the pupil's school life, proper attention is paid to these  primary principles and to _correct articulation_, a large majority of  students will graduate from our common schools prepared to advance in  the art of elocution or of singing without being obliged first to  unlearn a vast amount of error and to correct a long list of bad  habits.    If each day in the public schools a few minutes only are devoted to  the subject by a teacher who understands it and who will call the  attention of the pupils to the proper applications of the principles  in their daily recitations, it will be found amply sufficient to  develop and establish a good speaking and singing voice.      ARTISTRY    If artistry is to be attained, every organ must be individually well  trained. Yet, during performance, no one part should be given undue  prominence. The voice should be the product of all the organs equally  well developed. Continued practice will enable the performer to  correlate the whole--blend the strength of all in one.    It goes without saying that no one in singing or speaking should  appear to be governed by a \"method.\" During the early stages of  education, pupils should be amenable to rules and methods, but they  must not expect to be acceptable performers until able to forget their  lessons and simply and unconsciously make use of all the advantages of  their training. Even when the education is finished, and the _prima  donna_ has made her successful debut, continued daily repetition of  primary exercises is necessary to maintain excellence and insure the  progress that every performer desires. Our best singers to-day are as  diligent students of the technique of the voice as are the tyros  struggling with the first elements.      LIFE'S PERIODS    Human life is divided into three periods: _first_, that of effort to  get an education; _second_, of effort to maintain it; and _third_, of  effort to resist the natural decline which comes with advancing years.  The singer and speaker must drill to develop the voice, must drill to  keep it in condition, and must drill to resist the encroachments of  senility. Eternal vigilance is the price of vocal success.      APPLICATION OF ESSENTIALS    The application of the principles here discussed will show that a  musical voice is not the product of mysterious systems, but a matter  of scientific certainty. The essentials are good breathing, good  focusing, good resonance, and good articulation. These four elements  are so interdependent that one cannot be perfected without the other.  With these attained, the intellect, the sentiment, and the emotion of  the performer will culminate in artistic excellence.      REPOSE AS A PREPARATION FOR VOCAL EXERCISE    The nervousness or fear which manifests itself in constraint and  rigidity of the muscles and sometimes in stage fright is a serious  hindrance to progress. The effectual offset to this painful condition  is repose.    The art of inducing a condition of repose can be readily acquired by  any one who will carefully and faithfully do as follows: Place  yourself in an easy lying or lounging position in a quiet place, with  fresh air. Physical repose prepares for and invites mental repose. Now  allow the mind to work care free at its own sweet will without any  attempt to control it. Close the eyes and _breathe slowly, gently, and  deeply, with steady rhythm_. In two or three minutes a sensation of  quiet restful repose will be experienced, which may be continued for  several minutes or may even lead to a natural sound sleep.    This result may not be attained at the first or the second trial, but  a few repetitions of the exercise will insure success in almost every  case. After the art is attained in this formal way, ability to induce  the same repose when sitting upright, or while standing, will be  quickly developed.    This repose is the fitting preparation for a lesson or a performance  and may be induced during the progress of either, to allay any  trepidation incident to the situation. A mastery of this simple art  will make progress in the work of voice development much more rapid,  and make attainable a degree of discipline that is impossible without  it. It will prove for the beginner a sure prevention of stage fright  and a great relief to the most chronic sufferer from this malady.      THE VIBRATO    The _vibrato_ is a rhythmic pulsation of the voice. It often appears  in untrained voices; in others it appears during the process of  cultivation. Some have thought it the perfection of sympathetic  quality; others esteem it a fault.    The vibrato is caused by an undulating variation of pitch or power,  often both. The voice does not hold steadily and strictly to the  pitch, and according to the amount of the variation a corresponding  vibrato, or tremolo, is produced.    The action of stringed instruments illustrates this statement. The  finger of the violinist vibrates on the string by rocking rapidly back  and forth and the vibrato is the result.    The same is true of the human instrument. By variation of the tension,  the vocal apparatus sends forth several tones in alternation, of a  slightly different pitch, which together produce the effect.    Three sources are ascribed for the vibrato; one is a rapid, spasmodic  vibration of the diaphragm, causing variation of breath pressure;  another is the alternate tension and relaxation of the larynx and  vocal cords; a third is that commonest of faults--throat stiffness.  Either cause is possible, and variation in the pitch or intensity of  the tone is the result. Sufficient investigations have not been made  to make the matter certain, but tremolo, trembling of the vocal  organs, and muscular stiffness, or unnatural tension, seem to go  together.    It is quite possible in the early stages of culture so to train the  voice as to use the vibrato or not at will, but if not early  controlled this, like other bad habits, gains the mastery. Excessive  vibrato has spoiled "]]]
