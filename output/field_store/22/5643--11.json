These  contracted dwellings, filled day and night with human beings, are another  point dangerous alike to the morals and the health of the inhabitants.\"  And how greatly these cottages are crowded, the Report on the Health of  the Working-Classes, quoted above, bears testimony: \"In Leeds we found  brothers and sisters, and lodgers of both sexes, sharing the parents'  sleeping-room, whence arise consequences at the contemplation of which  human feeling shudders.\"    So, too, Bradford, which, but seven miles from Leeds at the junction of  several valleys, lies upon the banks of a small, coal-black,  foul-smelling stream.  On week-days the town is enveloped in a grey cloud  of coal smoke, but on a fine Sunday it offers a superb picture, when  viewed from the surrounding heights.  Yet within reigns the same filth  and discomfort as in Leeds.  The older portions of the town are built  upon steep hillsides, and are narrow and irregular.  In the lanes,  alleys, and courts lie filth and _debris_ in heaps; the houses are  ruinous, dirty, and miserable, and in the immediate vicinity of the river  and the valley bottom I found many a one, whose ground-floor, half-buried  in the hillside, was totally abandoned.  In general, the portions of the  valley bottom in which working-men's cottages have crowded between the  tall factories, are among the worst built and dirtiest districts of the  whole town.  In the newer portions of this, as of every other factory  town, the cottages are more regular, being built in rows, but they share  here, too, all the evils incident to the customary method of providing  working-men's dwellings, evils of which we shall have occasions to speak  more particularly in discussing Manchester.  The same is true of the  remaining towns of the West Riding, especially of Barnsley, Halifax and  Huddersfield.  The last named, the handsomest by far of all the factory  towns of Yorkshire and Lancashire, by reason of its charming situation  and modern architecture, has yet its bad quarter; for a committee  appointed by a meeting of citizens to survey the town, reported August  5th, 1844: \"It is notorious that in Huddersfield whole streets and many  lanes and courts are neither paved nor supplied with sewers nor other  drains; that in them refuse, _debris_, and filth of every sort lies  accumulating, festers and rots, and that, nearly everywhere, stagnant  water accumulates in pools, in consequence of which the adjoining  dwellings must inevitably be bad and filthy, so that in such places  diseases arise and threaten the health of the whole town.\"    If we cross Blackstone Edge or penetrate it with the railroad, we enter  upon that classic soil on which English manufacture has achieved its  masterwork and from which all labour movements emanate, namely, South  Lancashire with its central city Manchester.  Again we have beautiful  hill country, sloping gently from the watershed westwards towards the  Irish Sea, with the charming green valleys of the Ribble, the Irwell, the  Mersey, and their tributaries, a country which, a hundred years ago  chiefly swamp land, thinly populated, is now sown with towns and  villages, and is the most densely populated strip of country in England.  In Lancashire, and especially in Manchester, English manufacture finds at  once its starting point and its centre.  The Manchester Exchange is the  thermometer for all the fluctuations of trade.  The modern art of  manufacture has reached its perfection in Manchester.  In the cotton  industry of South Lancashire, the application of the forces of Nature,  the superseding of hand labour by machinery (especially by the power-loom  and the self-acting mule), and the division of labour, are seen at the  highest point; and, if we recognise in these three elements that which is  characteristic of modern manufacture, we must confess that the cotton  industry has remained in advance of all other branches of industry from  the beginning down to the present day.  The effects of modern manufacture  upon the working-class must necessarily develop here most freely and  perfectly, and the manufacturing proletariat present itself in its  fullest classic perfection.  The degradation to which the application of  steam-power, machinery and the division of labour reduce the working-man,  and the attempts of the proletariat to rise above this abasement, must  likewise be carried to the highest point and with the fullest  consciousness.  Hence because Manchester is the classic type of a modern  manufacturing town, and because I know it as intimately as my own native  town, more intimately than most of its residents know it, we shall make a  longer stay here.    The towns surrounding Manchester vary little from the central city, so  far as the working-people's quarters are concerned, except that the  working-class forms, if possible, a larger proportion of their  population.  These towns are purely industrial and conduct all their  business through Manchester upon which they are in every respect  dependent, whence they are inhabited only by working-men and petty  tradesmen, while Manchester has a very considerable commercial  population, especially of commission and \"respectable\" retail dealers.  Hence Bolton, Preston, Wigan, Bury, Rochdale, Middleton, Heywood, Oldham,  Ashton, Stalybridge, Stockport, etc., though nearly all towns of thirty,  fifty, seventy to ninety thousand inhabitants, are almost wholly working-  people's districts, interspersed only with factories, a few thoroughfares  lined with shops, and a few lanes along which the gardens and houses of  the manufacturers are scattered like villas.  The towns themselves are  badly and irregularly built with foul courts, lanes, and back alleys,  reeking of coal smoke, and especially dingy from the originally bright  red brick, turned black with time, which is here the universal building  material.  Cellar dwellings are general here; wherever it is in any way  possible, these subterranean dens are constructed, and a very  considerable portion of the population dwells in them.    Among the worst of these towns after Preston and Oldham is Bolton, eleven  miles north-west of Manchester.  It has, so far as I have been able to  observe in my repeated visits, but one main street, a very dirty one,  Deansgate, which serves as a market, and is even in the finest weather a  dark, unattractive hole in spite of the fact that, except for the  factories, its sides are formed by low one and two-storied houses.  Here,  as everywhere, the older part of the town is especially ruinous and  miserable.  A dark-coloured body of water, which leaves the beholder in  doubt whether it is a brook or a long string of stagnant puddles, flows  through the town and contributes its share to the total pollution of the  air, by no means pure without it.    There is Stockport, too, which lies on the Cheshire side of the Mersey,  but belongs nevertheless to the manufacturing district of Manchester.  It  lies in a narrow valley along the Mersey, so that the streets slope down  a steep hill on one side and up an equally steep one on the other, while  the railway from Manchester to Birmingham passes over a high viaduct  above the city and the whole valley.  Stockport is renowned throughout  the entire district as one of the duskiest, smokiest holes, and looks,  indeed, especially when viewed from the viaduct, excessively repellent.  But far more repulsive are the cottages and cellar dwellings of the  working-class, which stretch in long rows through all parts of the town  from the valley bottom to the crest of the hill.  I do not remember to  have seen so many cellars used as dwellings in any other town of this  district.    A few miles north-east of Stockport is Ashton-under-Lyne, one of the  newest factory towns of this region.  It stands on the slope of a hill at  the foot of which are the canal and the river Tame, and is, in general,  built on the newer, more regular plan.  Five or six parallel streets  stretch along the hill intersected at right angles by others leading down  into the valley.  By this method, the factories would be excluded from  the town proper, even if the proximity of the river and the canal-way did  not draw them all into the valley where they stand thickly crowded,  belching forth black smoke from their chimneys.  To this arrangement  Ashton owes a much more attractive appearance than that of most factory  towns; the streets are broad and cleaner, the cottages look new, bright  red, and comfortable.  But the modern system of building cottages for  working-men has its own disadvantages; every street has its concealed  back lane to which a narrow paved path leads, and which is all the  dirtier.  And, although I saw no buildings, except a few on entering,  which could have been more than fifty years old, there are even in Ashton  streets in which the cottages are getting bad, where the bricks in the  house-corners are no longer firm but shift about, in which the walls have  cracks and will not hold the chalk whitewash inside; streets, whose  dirty, smoke-begrimed aspect is nowise different from that of the other  towns of the district, except that in Ashton, this is the exception, not  the rule.    A mile eastward lies Stalybridge, also on the Tame.  In coming over the  hill from Ashton, the traveller has, at the top, both right and left,  fine large gardens with superb villa-like houses in their midst, built  usually in the Elizabethan style, which is to the Gothic precisely what  the Anglican Church is to the Apostolic Roman Catholic.

Should they hide Me  away in the depths of the earth, yet would they find Me riding aloft on  the clouds, and calling out unto God, the Lord of strength and of might. I  have offered Myself up in the way of God, and I yearn after tribulations  in My love for Him, and for the sake of His good pleasure. Unto this bear  witness the woes which now afflict Me, the like of which no other man hath  suffered. Every single hair of Mine head calleth out that which the  Burning Bush uttered on Sinai, and each vein of My body invoketh God and  saith: \"O would I had been severed in Thy path, so that the world might be  quickened, and all its peoples be united!\" Thus hath it been decreed by  Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.    143 Know of a truth that your subjects are God's trust amongst you. Watch  ye, therefore, over them as ye watch over your own selves. Beware that ye  allow not wolves to become the shepherds of the fold, or pride and conceit  to deter you from turning unto the poor and the desolate. Wert thou to  quaff the mystic Wine of everlasting life from the chalice of the words of  thy Lord, the All-Merciful, thou wouldst be enabled to forsake all that  thou dost possess and to proclaim My Name before all mankind. Cleanse then  thy soul with the waters of detachment. Verily, this is the Remembrance  that hath shone forth above the horizon of creation, which shall purge thy  soul from the dross of the world. Abandon thy palaces to the people of the  graves, and thine empire to whosoever desireth it, and turn, then, unto  the Kingdom. This, verily, is what God hath chosen for thee, wert thou of  them that turn unto Him. They that have failed to turn unto the  Countenance of God in this Revelation are indeed bereft of life. They move  as bidden by their own selfish desires, and are in truth accounted among  the dead. Shouldst thou desire to bear the weight of thy dominion, bear it  then to aid the Cause of thy Lord. Glorified be this station which whoever  attaineth thereunto hath attained unto all good that proceedeth from Him  Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    144 Arise thou, in My name, above the horizon of renunciation, and set,  then, thy face towards the Kingdom, at the bidding of thy Lord, the Lord  of strength and of might. Through the power of My sovereignty stand before  the inhabitants of the world and say: \"O people! The Day is come, and the  fragrances of God have been wafted over the whole of creation. They that  have turned away from His Face are the helpless victims of their corrupt  inclinations. They are indeed of them that have gone astray.\"    145 Adorn the body of Thy kingdom with the raiment of My name, and arise,  then, to teach My Cause. Better is this for thee than that which thou  possessest. God will, thereby, exalt thy name among all the kings. Potent  is He over all things. Walk thou amongst men in the name of God, and by  the power of His might, that thou mayest show forth His signs amidst the  peoples of the earth. Burn thou brightly with the flame of this undying  Fire which the All-Merciful hath ignited in the midmost heart of creation,  that through thee the heat of His love may be kindled within the hearts of  His favoured ones. Follow in My way and enrapture the hearts of men  through remembrance of Me, the Almighty, the Most Exalted.    146 Say: He from whom, in this day, the sweet savours of the remembrance  of His Lord, the All-Merciful, have not been diffused, is indeed unworthy  of the station of man. He, verily, is of them that have followed their own  desires, and shall erelong find himself in grievous loss. Doth it behove  you to relate yourselves to Him Who is the God of mercy, and yet commit  the things which the Evil One hath committed? Nay, by the Beauty of Him  Who is the All-Glorified! could ye but know it. Purge your hearts from  love of the world, and your tongues from calumny, and your limbs from  whatsoever may withhold you from drawing nigh unto God, the Mighty, the  All-Praised. Say: By the world is meant that which turneth you aside from  Him Who is the Dawning-Place of Revelation, and inclineth you unto that  which is unprofitable unto you. Verily, the thing that deterreth you, in  this day, from God is worldliness in its essence. Eschew it, and approach  the Most Sublime Vision, this shining and resplendent Seat. Blessed is he  who alloweth nothing whatsoever to intervene between him and his Lord. No  harm, assuredly, can befall him if he partaketh with justice of the  benefits of this world, inasmuch as We have created all things for such of  Our servants as truly believe in God.    147 Should your words, O people, be at variance with your deeds, what then  shall distinguish you from those who profess their faith in the Lord,  their God, and yet, when He came down to them overshadowed with clouds,  rejected Him and waxed proud before God, the Incomparable, the Omniscient?  Shed not the blood of anyone, O people, neither judge ye anyone unjustly.  Thus have ye been commanded by Him Who knoweth, Who is informed of all.  They that commit disorders in the land after it hath been well ordered,  these indeed have outstepped the bounds that have been set in the Book.  Wretched shall be the abode of the transgressors!    148 God hath prescribed unto everyone the duty of teaching His Cause.  Whoever ariseth to discharge this duty, must needs, ere he proclaimeth His  Message, adorn himself with the ornament of an upright and praiseworthy  character, so that his words may attract the hearts of such as are  receptive to his call. Without it, he can never hope to influence his  hearers. Thus doth God instruct you. He, verily, is the Ever-Forgiving,  the Most Compassionate.    149 They who exhort others unto justice, while themselves committing  iniquity, stand accused of falsehood by the inmates of the Kingdom and by  those who circle round the throne of their Lord, the Almighty, the  Beneficent, for that which their tongues have uttered. Commit not, O  people, that which dishonoureth your name and the fair name of the Cause  of God amongst men. Beware lest ye approach that which your minds abhor.  Fear God and follow not in the footsteps of them that are gone astray.  Deal not treacherously with the substance of your neighbour. Be ye  trustworthy on earth, and withhold not from the poor the things given unto  you by God through His grace. He, verily, will bestow upon you the double  of what ye possess. He, in truth, is the All-Bounteous, the Most Generous.    150 Say: We have ordained that our Cause be taught through the power of  utterance. Beware lest ye dispute idly with anyone. Whoso ariseth wholly  for the sake of his Lord to teach His Cause, the Holy Spirit shall  strengthen him and inspire him with that which will illumine the heart of  the world, how much more the hearts of those who seek Him. O people of  Baha! Subdue the citadels of men's hearts with the swords of wisdom and of  utterance. They that dispute, as prompted by their desires, are indeed  wrapped in a palpable veil. Say: The sword of wisdom is hotter than summer  heat, and sharper than blades of steel, if ye do but understand. Draw it  forth in My name and through the power of My might, and conquer then with  it the cities of the hearts of them that have secluded themselves in the  stronghold of their corrupt desires. Thus biddeth you the Pen of the  All-Glorious, whilst seated beneath the swords of the wayward.    151 If ye become aware of a sin committed by another, conceal it, that God  may conceal your own sin. He, verily, is the Concealer, the Lord of grace  abounding. O ye rich ones on earth! If ye encounter one who is poor, treat  him not disdainfully. Reflect upon that whereof ye were created. Every one  of you was created of a sorry germ.(18) It behoveth you to observe  truthfulness, whereby your temples shall be adorned, your names uplifted,  your stations exalted amidst men, and a mighty recompense assured for you  before God.    152 Give ear, O peoples of the earth, unto that which the Pen of the Lord  of all nations commandeth you. Know ye of a certainty that the  Dispensations of the past have attained their highest, their final  consummation in the Law that hath branched out from this Most Great Ocean.  Haste ye thereunto at Our behest. We, verily, ordain as We please. Regard  ye the world as a man's body, which is afflicted with divers ailments, and  the recovery of which dependeth upon the harmonizing of all of its  component elements. Gather ye around that which We have prescribed unto  you, and walk not in the ways of such as create dissension.    153 All feasts have attained their consummation in the two Most Great  Festivals, and in two other Festivals that fall on the twin days--the first  of the Most Great Festivals being those days whereon God shed the  effulgent glory of His most excellent Names upon all who are in heaven and  on earth, and the second being that day on which We raised up the One Who  announced unto the people the glad tidings of this Great Announcement.(19)  Thus hath it been set down in the Book by Him Who is the Mighty, the  Powerful. On other than these four consummate days, engage ye in your  daily occupations, and withhold yourselves not from the pursuit of your  trades and crafts. Thus hath the command been issued and the law gone  forth from Him Who is your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    154 Say: O concourse of priests and monks! Eat ye of that which God hath  made lawful unto you and do not shun meat. God hath, as a token of His  grace, granted you leave to partake thereof save during a brief period.  He, verily, is the Mighty, the Beneficent. Forsake all that ye possess and  hold fast unto that which God hath purposed. This is that which profiteth  you, if ye be of them that comprehend."]]]
