This Act may be cited for all purposes as the Natives' Land Act, 1913.  ==    The foregoing result of a legislative jumble is \"the law\",  and this law, like Alexander the coppersmith, \"hath done us much harm\".  Mr. Sauer carried his Bill less by reason than by sheer force of numbers,  and partly by promises which he afterwards broke.  Among these broken promises  was the definite assurance he gave Parliament that the Bill  would be referred to the Select Committee on Native Affairs,  so that the Natives, who are not represented in Parliament,  their European friends and the Missionary bodies on behalf of the Natives,  could be able at the proper time to appear before this committee and state  any objection which they might have to the Bill.  But when that time came,  the Minister flatly refused to refer it to the committee.  This change of front is easily explained, because the weight of evidence  which could have been given before any Parliamentary committee  would have imperilled the passage of the Bill.    As might have been expected, the debate on the Bill created the greatest alarm  amongst the native population, for they had followed its course  with the keenest interest.  Nothing short of a declaration of war against them  could have created a similar excitement, although the hope was entertained  in some quarters, that a body of men like the Ministerialists in Parliament  (a majority of whom are never happier than when attesting  the Christian character of their race) would in course of days  attend the Holy Communion, remember the 11th Commandment,  and do unto others as they would that men should do unto them.  Our people, in fact a number of them, said amongst themselves  that even Dutchmen sing Psalms -- all the Psalms, including the 24th;  and, believing as they did that Dutchmen could have no other religion  besides the one recommended in the New Testament and preached by  the predikants of the Dutch Reformed Church, were prepared  to commend their safety to the influence of that sweet and peaceable religion.  However, some other Natives, remembering what took place before  the South African war, took a different view of these religious incidents.  Those Natives, especially of the old Republics, knew that  the only dividing fence between the Transvaal Natives and complete slavery  was the London Convention; they, therefore, now that the London Convention  in fact had ceased to exist, had evil forebodings regarding  the average Republican's treatment of the Natives, which was seldom influenced  by religious scruples, and they did not hesitate to express their fears.    Personally we must say that if any one had told us at the beginning of 1913,  that a majority of members of the Union Parliament were capable of passing  a law like the Natives' Land Act, whose object is to prevent the Natives  from ever rising above the position of servants to the whites,  we would have regarded that person as a fit subject for the lunatic asylum.  But the passing of that Act and its operation have rudely  forced the fact upon us that the Union Parliament is capable of producing  any measure that is subversive of native interests; and that  the complete arrest of native progress is the object aimed at  in their efforts to include the Protectorates in their Union.  Thus we think that their sole reason for seeking to incorporate Basutoland,  Swaziland and Bechuanaland is that, when they have definitely eliminated  the Imperial factor from South Africa, as they are unmistakably trying to do,  they may have a million more slaves than if the Protectorates were excluded.    In this connexion, the realization of the prophecy of an old Basuto  became increasingly believable to us.  It was to this effect, namely:  \"That the Imperial Government, after conquering the Boers,  handed back to them their old Republics, and a nice little present  in the shape of the Cape Colony and Natal -- the two English Colonies.  That the Boers are now ousting the Englishmen from the public service,  and when they have finished with them, they will make a law  declaring it a crime for a Native to live in South Africa,  unless he is a servant in the employ of a Boer, and that from this  it will be just one step to complete slavery.\"  This is being realized,  for to-day we have, extended throughout the Union of South Africa,  a \"Free\" State law which makes it illegal for Natives  to live on farms except as servants in the employ of Europeans.  There is another \"Free\" State law, under which no Native  may live in a municipal area or own property in urban localities.  He can only live in town as a servant in the employ of a European.  And if the followers of General Hertzog are permitted  to dragoon the Union Government into enforcing \"Free\" State ideals  against the Natives of the Union, as they have successfully done  under the Natives' Land Act, it will only be a matter of time  before we have a Natives' Urban Act enforced throughout South Africa.  Then we will have the banner of slavery fully unfurled (of course,  under another name) throughout the length and breadth of the land.    When the Natives' Land Bill was before Parliament, meetings were held  in many villages and locations in protest against the Ministerial surrender  to the Republicans, of which the Bill was the outcome.  At the end of March, 1913, the Native National Congress met in Johannesburg,  and there a deputation was appointed to go to Capetown  and point out to the Government some, at least, of the harm  that would follow legislation of the character mapped out in Parliament  on February 28 when the Land Act was first announced.  They were to urge  that such a measure would be exploitation of the cruelest kind, that it  would not only interfere with the economic independence of the Natives,  but would reduce them for ever to a state of serfdom, and degrade them  as nothing has done since slavery was abolished at the Cape.  Missionaries also, and European friends of the Natives, did not sit still.  Resolution after resolution, telegraphic and other representations,  were made to Mr. Sauer, from meetings in various parts of the country,  counselling prudence.  Even such societies as the Transvaal Landowners,  who had long been crying for a measure to separate whites from blacks,  and vice versa, urged that the Bill should not be passed during  the same session in which it was introduced, that the country should be given  an opportunity to digest it, in order, if necessary, to suggest amendments.  The Missionary bodies, too, represent a following of Natives  numbering hundreds of thousands of souls, on whose behalf  they pleaded for justice.  These bodies urged that before passing a law,  prohibiting the sale and lease of land to Natives, and expelling squatters  from their homes, the Government should provide locations  to which the evicted Natives could go.  But all these representations  made no impression upon the Government, who, instead, preferred to act  upon the recommendation of thirteen diminutive petitions  (signed in all by 304 Dutchmen in favour of the Bill)* than to be guided  by the overwhelming weight of public opinion that was against its passage.  Thus it became clear that the Native's position in his own country  was not an enviable one, for once a law was made prohibiting  the sale of landed property to Natives, it would be almost impossible  to get a South African Parliament to amend it.    --  * One of these thirteen petitions had only four signatures,    which was but one better than that of the Tooley Street tailors.  --    The Government, which at the beginning assured Parliament of their  humane intentions, proceeded to delete the mildest clauses of the measure  and to insert some very harsh ones; and almost each time  that the Bill came before the House, one or two fresh drastic clauses  were added.  But it is comforting to note that even Parliament  was not entirely satisfied with this, its heroic piece of legislation.  Thus Mr. Meyler of Natal did, as only a lawyer could with a view  to recasting the Bill, some very useful work in pointing out  the possible harm with which the Bill was fraught.  We wish that  his clever speeches and observations (much of which have come true),  might yet be sifted out of the big Parliamentary Reports,  and published in a concise little pamphlet.

Still let us go back in memory, back in the living presence of the past.  The two days flew so swiftly that I was agitated, as the happiness of  seeing her again drew nearer and nearer.  As the carriages and horsemen  arrived on the first day from the city, I saw that the castle was alive  with gaily-dressed visitors.  Banners fluttered from the roof, music  sounded through the castle-yard.  In the evening, the lake swarmed with  pleasure-boats.  The moennerchors sounded over the waves, and I could not  but listen, for I fancied she also listened to these songs from the  window.  Everything was stirring, also, on the second day, and early in  the afternoon the guests prepared for departure.  Late in the evening I  saw the Hofrath's carriage also going back alone to the city.  I could  not restrain myself any longer, I knew she was alone.  I knew she thought  of me, and longed for me.  Should I allow one night to pass without at  least pressing her hand, without saying to her that the separation was  over, that the next morning would waken us to new rapture.  I still saw a  light in her window--why should she be alone?  Why should I not, for one  moment at least, feel her sweet presence?  Already I stood at the castle;  already I was about to pull the bell--then suddenly I stopped and said:  \"No! no weakness!  You should be ashamed to stand before her like a thief  in the night.  Early in the morning go to her like a hero, returning from  battle, for whom she is now weaving the crown of love, which she will  place upon thy head in the morning.\"    And the morning came--and I was with her, really with her.  Oh, speak not  of the spirit as if it could exist without the body.  Complete existence,  consciousness, and enjoyment, can only be where body and soul are one--an  embodied spirit, a spiritualized body.  There is no spirit without body,  else it would be a ghost: there is no body without spirit, else it would  be a corpse.  Is the flower in the field without spirit? Does it not  appear in a divine will, in a creative thought which preserves it, and  gives it life and existence?  That is its soul--only it is silent in the  flower, while it manifests itself in man by words.  Real life is, after  all, the bodily and spiritual life; real consciousness is, after all, the  bodily and spiritual consciousness; real being together is, after all,  bodily and spiritually being together, and the whole world of memory in  which I had lived so happily for two days, disappeared like a shadow,  like a nonentity, as I stood before her, and was really with her.  I  could have laid my hands upon her brow, her eyes, and her cheeks, to  know, to unmistakably know, if it were really she--not only the image  which had hovered before my soul day and night, but a being who was not  mine, and still could and would be mine; a being in whom I could believe  as in myself; a being far from me and yet nearer to me than my own self;  a being without whom my life was no life, death was no death; without  whom my poor existence would dissolve into infinity like a sigh.  I felt,  as my thoughts and glances rested upon her, that now, in this very  instant, the happiness of my existence was complete--and a shudder crept  over me as I thought of death--but it seemed no longer to have any terror  for me; for death could not destroy this love; it would only purify;  ennoble, and immortalize it.    It was so beautiful to be silent with her.  The whole depth of her soul  was reflected in her countenance, and as I looked upon her I saw and  heard her every thought and emotion.  \"You make me sad,\" she seemed on  the point of saying, and yet would not, \"Are we not together again at  last?  Be quiet!  Complain not!  Ask not!  Speak not!  Be welcome to me!  Be not bad to me!\"  All this looked from her eyes, and still we did not  venture to disturb the peace of our happiness with a word.    \"Have you received a letter from the Hofrath?\" was the first question,  and her voice trembled with each word.    \"No,\" I replied.    She was silent for a time, and then said:    \"Perhaps it is better it has happened thus, and that I can tell you  everything myself.  My friend, we see each other to-day for the last  time.  Let us part in peace, without complaint and without anger.  I feel  that I have done you a great wrong.  I have intruded upon your life  without thinking that even a light breath often withers a flower.  I know  so little of the world that I did not believe a poor suffering being like  myself could inspire anything but pity.  I welcome you in a frank and  friendly way because I had known you so long, because I felt so well in  your presence--why should I not tell all?--because I loved you.  But the  world does not understand or tolerate this love.  The Hofrath has opened  my eyes.  The whole city is talking about us.  My brother, the Regent,  has written to the Prince, and he requests me never to see you again.  I  deeply regret that I have caused you this sorrow.  Tell me you forgive  me--and then let us separate as friends.\"    Her eyes had filled with tears, and she closed them that I should not see  her weeping.    \"Marie,\" said I, \"for me there is but one life which is with you; but for  you there is one will which is your own.  Yes, I confess, I love you with  the whole fire of love, but I feel I am not worthily yours.  You stand  far above me in nobility, sublimity and purity, and I can scarcely  understand the thought of ever calling you my wife.  And, yet, there is  no other road on which we could travel through life together.  Marie, you  are wholly free; I ask for no sacrifice.  The world is great, and if you  wish it, we shall never see each other again.  But if you love me, if you  feel you are mine, oh, then, let us forget the world and its cold  verdict.  In my arms I will bear you to the altar, and on my knees I will  swear to be yours in life and in death.\"    \"My friend,\" said she, \"we must never wish for the impossible.  Had it  been God's will that such a tie should unite us in this life, would He,  forsooth, have imposed these burdens upon me which make me incapable of  being else than a helpless child?  Do not forget that what we call Fate,  Circumstance, Relations, in life, is in reality only the work of  Providence.  To resist it is to resist God himself, and were it not so  childish one might call it presumptuous.  Men wander on earth like the  stars in heaven.  God has indicated the paths upon which they meet, and  if they are to separate, they must.  Resistance were useless, otherwise  it would destroy the whole system of the world.  We cannot understand it,  but we can submit to it.  I cannot myself understand why my inclination  towards you was wrong.  No!  I cannot, will not call it wrong.  But it  cannot be, it is not to be.  My friend, this is enough--we must submit in  humility and faith.\"    Notwithstanding the calmness with which she spoke, I saw how deeply she  suffered; and yet I thought it wrong to surrender so quickly in this  battle of life.  I restrained myself as much as I could, so that no  passionate word should increase her trouble, and said:    \"If this is the last time we are to meet in this life, let us see clearly  to whom we offer this sacrifice.  If our love violated any higher law  whatsoever, I would, as you say, bow myself in humility.  It were a  forgetfulness of God to oppose one's self to a higher will.  It may seem  at times as if men could delude God, as if their small sense had gained  some advantage over the Divine wisdom.  This is frenzy--and the man who  commences this Titanic battle; will be crushed and annihilated.  But what  opposes our love? Nothing but the talk of the world.  I respect the  customs of human society.  I even respect them when, as in our time, they  are over-refined and confused.  A sick body needs artificial medicines,  and without the barriers, the respect and the prejudices of society, at  which we smile, it were impossible to hold mankind together as at present  existing, and to accomplish the purpose of our temporal co-existence.  We  must sacrifice much to these divinities.  Like the Athenians, we send  every year a heavy boatload of youths and maidens as tribute to this  monster which rules the labyrinth of our society.  There is no longer a  heart that has not broken; there is no longer a man of true feelings who  has not been obliged to break the wings of his love before he came into  the cage of society for rest.  It must be so.  It cannot be otherwise.  You know not life, but thinking only of my friends, I can tell you many  volumes of tragedy.    \"One loved a maiden, and the love was returned; but he was poor, she was  rich.  The fathers and relatives wrangled and sneered, and two hearts  were broken.  Why?  Because the world looked upon it as a misfortune for  a woman to wear a dress made of the wool of a shrub in America, and not  of the fibres of a worm in China.    \"Another loved a maiden, and was loved in return; but he was a  Protestant, she was a Catholic.  The mothers and the priests bred  mischief, and two hearts were broken.  Why?  On account of a political  game of chess which Charles V and Henry VIII played together, three  hundred years ago.    \"A third loved a maiden, and was loved in return; but he was a noble, she  a peasant.  The sisters were angry, and quarreled, and two hearts were  broken.  Why?  Because, a hundred years ago, one soldier slew another in  battle, who threatened the life of his king.  This gave him title and  honors, and his great grandson expiated the blood shed at that time, with  a disappointed life.    \"The statisticians say a heart is broken every hour, and I believe it.  But why?  In almost every case, because the world does not recognize love  between 'strange people,' unless it be between man and wife.  If two  maidens love the same man--the one must fall as a"]]]
