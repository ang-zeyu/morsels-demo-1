But such is not the case. There is not a single hymn  addressed independently to Dyaus, nor is there any hint of especial  preeminence of Dyaus in the half-dozen hymns that are sung to Heaven  and Earth together. The word _dyaus_ is used hundreds of times, but  generally in the meaning sky (without personification). There is, to  be sure, a formal acknowledgment of the fatherhood of Dyaus (among  gods he is father particularly of Dawn, the Acvins, and Indra), as  there is of the motherhood of Earth, but there is no further  exaltation. No exaggeration--the sign of Hindu enthusiasm--is  displayed in the laudation, and the epithet 'father' is given to half  a dozen Vedic gods, as in Rome Ma(r)spiter stands beside Jup(p)iter.  Certain functions are ascribed to Heaven and Earth, but they are of  secondary origin. Thus they bring to the god he sacrifice,[54] as does  Agni, and one whole hymn may thus be epitomized: 'By the ordinance of  Varuna made firm, O Heaven and Earth, give us blessings. Blest with  children and wealth is he that adores you twain. Give us sweet food,  glory and strength of heroes, ye who are our father and mother.'[55]    The praise is vague and the benevolence is the usual 'bestowal of  blessings' expected of all the gods in return for praise. Other hymns  add to this something, from which one sees that these deities are not  regarded as self-created; for the seers of old, or, according to one  poet some wonderful divine artisan, \"most wondrous worker of the  wonder-working gods,\" created them. Their chief office is to exercise  benign protection and bestow wealth. Once they are invited to come to  the sacrifice \"with the gods,\" but this, of course, is not meant to  exclude them from the list of gods[56].    The antithesis of male and female, to Bergaigne's insistence on which  reference was made above (p. 43), even here in this most obvious of  forms, common to so many religions, shows itself so faintly that it  fails utterly to support that basis of sexual dualism on which the  French scholar lays so much stress. Dyaus does, indeed, occasionally  take the place of Indra, and as a bellowing bull impregnate earth, but  this is wholly incidental and not found at all in the hymns directly  lauding Heaven and Earth. Moreover, instead of \"father and mother\"  Heaven and Earth often are spoken of as \"the two mothers,\" the  significance of which cannot be nullified by the explanation that to  the Hindu 'two mothers' meant two parents, and of two parents one must  be male,--Bergaigne's explanation. For not only is Dyaus one of the  'two mothers,' but when independently used the word Dyaus is male or  female indifferently. Thus in X. 93. I: \"O Heaven and Earth be wide  outstretched for us, (be) like two young women.\" The position of  Heaven and Earth in relation to other divinities varies with the fancy  of the poet that extols them. They are either created, or they create  gods, as well as create men. In accordance with the physical reach of  these deities they are exhorted to give strength whereby the  worshipper shall \"over-reach all peoples\"; and, as parents, to be the  \"nearest of the gods,\" to be \"like father and mother in kindness.\" (I.  159; 160. 2, 5.)    One more attribute remains to be noticed, which connects Dyaus morally  as well as physically with Savitar and Varuna. The verse in which this  attribute is spoken of is also not without interest from a  sociological point of view: \"Whatsoever sin we have committed against  the gods, or against a friend, or against the chief of the clan  (family)[57] may this hymn to Heaven and Earth avert it.\" It was shown  above that Savitar removes sin. Here, as in later times, it is the  hymn that does this. The mystery of these gods' origin puzzles the  seer: \"Which was first and which came later, how were they begotten,  who knows, O ye wise seers? Whatever exists, that they carry.\"[58] But  all that they do they do under the command of Mitra.[59]    The most significant fact in connection with the hymns to Heaven and  Earth is that most of them are expressly for sacrificial intent. \"With  sacrifices I praise Heaven and Earth\" (I. 159. 1); \"For the sake of  the sacrifice are ye come down (to us)\" (IV. 56. 7). In VI. 70 they  are addressed in sacrificial metaphors; in VII. 53. 1 the poet says:  \"I invoke Heaven and Earth with sacrifices,\" etc. The passivity of the  two gods makes them yield in importance to their son, the active  Savitar, who goes between the two parents. None of these hymns bears  the impress of active religious feeling or has poetic value. They all  seem to be reflective, studied, more or less mechanical, and to belong  to a period of theological philosophy. To Earth alone without Heaven  are addressed one uninspired hymn and a fragment of the same  character: \"O Earth be kindly to us, full of dwellings and painless,  and give us protection.\"[60] In the burial service the dead are  exhorted to \"go into kindly mother earth\" who will be \"wool-soft, like  a maiden.\"[61] The one hymn to Earth should perhaps be placed  parallel with similar meditative and perfunctory laudations in the  Homeric hymns:      To EARTH (V. 84).      In truth, O broad extended earth,    Thou bear'st the render of the hills,[62]    Thou who, O mighty mountainous one,    Quickenest created things with might.    Thee praise, O thou that wander'st far,    The hymns which light accompany,    Thee who, O shining one, dost send    Like eager steeds the gushing rain.    Thou mighty art, who holdest up    With strength on earth the forest trees,    When rain the rains that from thy clouds    And Dyaus' far-gleaming lightning come.[62]    On the bearing of these facts, especially in regard to the secondary  greatness of Dyaus, we shall touch below. He is a god exalted more by  modern writers than by the Hindus!      VARUNA.    Varuna has been referred already in connection with the sun-god and  with Heaven and Earth. It is by Varuna's power that they stand firm.  He has established the sun 'like a tree,' i.e., like a support, and  'made a path for it.'[63] He has a thousand remedies for ills; to his  realm not even the birds can ascend, nor wind or swift waters attain.  It is in accordance with the changeless order[64] of Varuna that the  stars and the moon go their regular course; he gives long life and  releases from harm, from wrong, and from sin.[65]    Varuna is the most exalted of those gods whose origin is physical. His  realm is all above us; the sun and stars are his eyes; he sits above  upon his golden throne and sees all that passes below, even the  thoughts of men. He is, above all, the moral controller of the  universe.      To VARUNA (i. 25).      Howe'er we, who thy people are,    O Varuna, thou shining god,    Thy order injure, day by day,    Yet give us over nor to death,    Nor to the blow of angry (foe),    Nor to the wrath of (foe) incensed.[66]    Thy mind for mercy we release--    As charioteer, a fast-bound steed--    By means of song, O Varuna.             *       *       *       *       *      ('Tis Varuna) who knows the track    Of birds that fly within the air,    And knows the ships upon the flood;[67]    Knows, too, the (god) of order firm,    The twelve months with their progeny,    And e'en which month is later born;[68]    Knows, too, the pathway of the wind,    The wide, the high, the mighty (wind),    And knows who sit above (the wind).      (God) of firm order, Varuna    His place hath ta'en within (his) home    For lordship, he, the very strong.[69]    Thence all the things that are concealed    He looks upon, considering    Whate'er is done and to be done.    May he, the Son of Boundlessness,    The very strong, through every day    Make good our paths, prolong our life.      Bearing a garment all of gold,    In jewels clothed, is Varuna,    And round about him sit his spies;    A god whom injurers injure not,    Nor cheaters cheat among the folk,    Nor any plotters plot against;    Who for himself 'mid (other) men    Glory unequalled gained, and gains    (Such glory) also 'mid ourselves.      Far go my thoughts (to him), as go    The eager cows that meadows seek,    Desiring (him), the wide-eyed (god).    Together let us talk again,    Since now the offering sweet I bring,    By thee beloved, and like a priest    Thou eat'st.      I see the wide-eyed (god):    I see his chariot on the earth,    My song with joy hath he received.      Hear this my call, O Varuna,    Be merciful to me today,    For thee, desiring help, I yearn.      Thou, wise one, art of everything,    The sky and earth alike, the king;    As such upon thy way give ear,    And loose from us the (threefold) bond;    The upper bond, the middle, break,    The lower, too, that we may live.    In the portrait of such a god as this one comes very near to  monotheism. The conception of an almost solitary deity, recognized as  watcher of wrong, guardian of right, and primitive creator, approaches  more closely to unitarianism than does the idea of any physical power  in the Rig Veda.    To the poet of the Rig Veda Varuna is the enveloping heaven;[70] that  is, in distinction from Dyaus, from whom he  differs _toto caelo_, so to speak, the invisible world, which embraces  the visible sky. His home is there where lives the Unborn, whose place  is unique, above the highest heaven.[71]    But it is exactly this loftiness of character that should make one shy  of interpreting Varuna as being originally the god that is presented  here. Can this god, 'most august of Vedic deities,' as Bergaigne and  others have called him, have belonged as such to the earliest stratum  of Aryan belief?    There are some twelve hymns in the Rig Veda in Varuna's honor. Of  these, one in the tenth book celebrates Indra as opposed to Varuna,  and generally it is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14515"],[0,"The Nervous Child (#13)"],[1,"and persistence, and when signs of irritation ensue if  gratification is not obtained, that we are justified in classing it  among the symptoms of mental unrest.    The second of these actions, thigh rubbing, is found for the most  part in little girls, and inasmuch as it consists of a stimulation of  the sexual organs sometimes causes much distress to the parents. It is  in reality a habit of small importance unless exercised with very  great frequency. It is, of course, not associated in the child's mind  with any sexual ideas, and is of precisely the same significance as  the other two actions of the same class. Children who can speak will  refer to it openly without any sense of shame. As a rule the action is  performed in a half-dream state, that condition between sleeping and  waking which is found when the child is lying in the morning in her  cot or in her perambulator after the midday nap. The child's attention  should not be focused on the symptom. She should lie on a hard  mattress, and when she wakes in the morning she should either leave  her cot at once or she should be roused into complete wakefulness by  encouraging her to play with her toys. Little children should be  taught to sleep with their hands folded and placed beside the cheek.  If the movement occurs on going to sleep, it is best left alone and  completely neglected. As a rule each child has his or her own  favourite action of this class, and they are seldom combined in the  same child. If thigh rubbing is very constant and obstinate and does  not yield to the measures suggested, it may even sometimes be a  successful manoeuvre to substitute the thumb-sucking habit in the  expectation that this less distressing habit may eject the other more  objectionable action. As a rule, however, a wise neglect and careful  watching during the drowsy condition that follows sleep in a warm bed  will succeed in stopping the practice of thigh rubbing before the end  of the second or third year. Apparatus designed to restrain movement  of the child's legs or blistering the opposed surfaces of the thighs  are both of no effect. They have indeed the positive disadvantage that  they focus the child's attention on the practice. The habit ceases  only when the child has forgotten all about it, and these devices  serve only to keep it in remembrance. The same may be said of any  system of punishments. Further, we cannot always have the child under  observation, and at some time or other opportunity will be found for  gratification. Of older children, in whom self-control and a sense of  honour can be cultivated, I am not here speaking.    Air swallowing is less common than thigh rubbing, but belongs to the  same group of actions and takes place in the same drowsy condition.  The child will rapidly gulp down air which distends the stomach, and  is then regurgitated with a loud sound. Thumb sucking seldom  distresses the mother to the same extent, and the proper attitude of  tolerance is adopted towards it. If much is made of it, it is  astonishing how persistent the habit may become, surviving all  attempts to forbid it, to break it by rewards or punishments, or to  render it distasteful by the application of a variety of ill-tasting  substances smeared on the offending digit.    PICA AND DIRT EATING    Certain other bad habits will become ingrained if attention is called  to them, because of that curious spirit of opposition which  characterises little children, and because of their susceptibility to  suggestion. Some children will constantly pluck out hairs and eat  them, or will devour particles of fluff drawn from the blankets.  Others will seize every opportunity to eat unpleasant things, such as  earth, sand, mud, or dirt of any sort. All tricks of this sort are  best neglected and treated by attracting the child's attention to  other things. In adult life they are associated with serious mental  disturbance, in early childhood they are of little account, or at most  suggest a certain nervousness which may be due to nervous irritation  from faults of management which we must strive to correct.      CONSTIPATION    As has been already mentioned, much of the common constipation of the  nursery is due to neurosis. The excessive concentration of the nurse's  thoughts on this daily question communicates itself to the child. The  difficulty is emphasised, and an attempt is made to substitute will  power for forces of suggestion which are at once inhibited by  concentration of the mind upon the process. Here also, just as in the  refusal of food, a further stage of \"negativism,\" that is, of active  resistance with crying and struggling, is reached, so that complaint  may be made by the mother that defaecation is painful. The same  negativism may be shown in micturition, and mothers will give  distressing accounts of the suffering of the child during the passing  of water.      BREATH-HOLDING AND LARYNGISMUS STRIDULUS    In some children, in the first two years of life, we find a definite  and measurable increase in the irritability and conductivity of the  peripheral nerves. The strength of current necessary to produce by  direct stimulation of the nerve a minimal twitch of the corresponding  muscle may be many times less than the normal. Of this heightened  irritability of the nervous system, to which the name \"spasmophilia\"  has been given in America and on the Continent, the most striking  symptom is a liability alike to tetany or carpo-pedal spasm, to  generalised convulsions, and to laryngismus stridulus. In addition, in  most cases it is generally possible to demonstrate the presence of  Chvostek's sign and of Trousseau's sign. Chvostek's sign consists in a  visible twitch of the facial musculature, especially of the  orbicularis palpebrarum or of the orbicularis oris, in response to a  gentle tap administered over the facial nerve in front of the ear.  Trousseau's sign is the production of tetany by applying firm and  prolonged pressure to the brachial nerve in the upper arm. The  aetiology of spasmophilia is still a matter for dispute, but the  evidence which we possess is in favour of the view that we have here  to deal with a disturbance of calcium metabolism. The calcium content  both of the blood and of the central nervous system has been shown to  be much lowered. It is in keeping with this that clinically we note  how frequently spasmophilia and rickets occur in the same child. In  some families the condition recurs through many generations.    For our present purpose--the examination of some common neuroses of  nursery life--it would be out of place to enter into a detailed  consideration of this disorder of spasmophilia as a whole. The symptom  of laryngismus stridulus--the so-called breath-holding--alone need  concern us, and that for a special reason. The spasm of the glottis is  produced under the influence of any strong emotion--in anger, for  example, or in fear, in excitement or in crying for any reason. To  control or prevent it we must direct attention not only to the  condition of spasmophilia, but also to the management of the children  who are always excitable and emotional. In these children every burst  of crying, however produced, whether by a fall, by a fright, by the  entrance of a stranger, or by a visit to a doctor, is apt to be  ushered in by a long period of apnoea, due to spasm of the glottis  and of the diaphragm. The first few expirations are not followed by  any inspiration. For several seconds the silence may be complete,  while the child steadily becomes more and more cyanosed, or the body  may be shaken by incomplete expiratory movements and strangled cries  which are suppressed because the chest is already in a position of  almost complete expiration. In the worst cases, when the apnoea  lasts a very long time, there may be convulsive twitching of the  muscles of the face, or the attack may even terminate in general  convulsions. Very occasionally the spasm is actually fatal. In all  fatal cases which have come to my notice the child at the moment of  death had been alone in the room. I have met with no fatal case where  the baby could be picked up and assisted. As a rule, therefore, the  cause and mode of death must be conjectural, but when an infant is  found dead in its cot unexpectedly, it would seem likely that it has  waked from sleep with a sudden start, become excited, and, about to  cry, has been seized by the fatal spasm. In two instances reported to  me a cat had been found in the room with the dead child, and it was  suggested that the animal had lain upon the child's face. Both these  children, however, were vigorous and capable of powerful movements of  resistance. I think it more likely that the cat may have awakened them  in fright, and that the emotional excitement, giving rise to the  spasm, was the cause of the suffocation. That the apnoea in these  extremely rare instances should end fatally produces a difficult  position for the doctor. It need hardly be said that the seizures are  alarming to the parents. For the sake of great accuracy in the  statement of our prognosis are we to add a hundred times to the  mother's alarm by stating the possibility of death? In each case we  must use our own judgment. I believe that in a child over a year old  the risk is almost negligible.    Fortunately in all save the rarest possible instances the apnoea  yields and a deep inspiratory movement follows. As the air rushes past  the glottis, which is still partially closed, a sound recalling the  whoop of pertussis is heard. Often this recurs throughout all the  burst of crying which follows, and each inspiration is accompanied by  a shrill stridulous sound. With the re-establishment of respiration  the cyanosis rapidly fades, to be succeeded in some cases by pallor  and perspiration.    It need hardly be said that we should do all in our power to prevent  these alarming and distressing attacks. Each "]]]
