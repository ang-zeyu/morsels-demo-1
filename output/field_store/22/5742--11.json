The long prayer which is the most elaborate of the three has to be recited  once in every twenty-four hours, and at any time one feels inclined to do  so.    \"The believer is entirely free to choose any one of those three prayers  but is under the obligation of reciting one of them, and in accordance  with any specific directions with which they may be accompanied.    \"These daily obligatory prayers, together with a few other specific ones,  such as the Healing Prayer, the Tablet of Ahmad, have been invested by  Baha'u'llah with a special potency and significance, and should therefore  be accepted as such and be recited by the believers with unquestioned  faith and confidence, that through them they may enter into a much closer  communion with God, and identify themselves more fully with His Laws and  precepts.\"            161: PRAYERS (HEALING)      \"The healing prayers revealed by Baha'u'llah can be effective even though  used by non-believers. But their effectiveness is of course greater in the  case of those who fully accept the Revelation.\"            162: PRAYERS (TO BE READ AS REVEALED)      \"Regarding your question as to the changing of pronouns in Baha'i prayers:  The Guardian does not approve of such changes, either in the specific  prayers or in any others. They should be read as printed without changing  a single word.\"            163: PREJUDICES (RACIAL)      \"Regarding the solution of the racial problem; the believers should of  course realize that the principle of the oneness of mankind which is the  cornerstone of the message of Baha'u'llah is wholly incompatible with all  forms of racial prejudice. Loyalty to this foundation principle of the  Faith is the paramount duty of every believer and should be therefore  wholehearted and unqualified. For a Baha'i, racial prejudice, in all its  forms, is simply a negation of Faith, an attitude wholly incompatible with  the very spirit and actual teachings of the Cause.    \"But while the friends should faithfully and courageously uphold this  Baha'i principle of the essential unity of all human races, yet in the  methods they adopt for its application and further realization on the  social plane they should act with tact, wisdom and moderation. These two  attitudes are by no means exclusive. Baha'is do not believe that the  spread of the Cause and its principles and teachings can be effected by  means of radical and violent methods. While they are loyal to all those  teachings, yet they believe in the necessity of resorting to peaceful and  friendly means for the realization of their aims.    \"As regards the meaning of the passage on page 188 of the Gleanings it is  an emphasis by Baha'u'llah on the importance of maintaining differences of  station and classes in society and does not refer to the question of  race.\"            164: PROPHETS (MANY WILL APPEAR)      \"After Baha'u'llah many Prophets will, no doubt, appear but they will be  under His Shadow. Although they may abrogate the laws of this Dispensation  in accordance with the needs and requirements of the age in which they  appear, they nevertheless draw their spiritual force from this mighty  Revelation. The Faith of Baha'u'llah constitutes, indeed, the stage of  maturity in the development of mankind. His appearance has released such  spiritual forces which will continue to animate, for many long years to  come, the world in its development. Whatever progress may be achieved, in  later ages, after the unification of the whole human race is achieved,  will be but improvement in the machinery of the world. For the machinery  itself has been already created by Baha'u'llah. The task of continually  improving and perfecting this machinery is one which later Prophets will  be called upon to achieve. They will thus move and work within the orbit  of the Baha'i Cycle.\"            165: PSYCHIATRY      \"There is nothing in our teachings about Freud and his method. Psychiatry  treatment in general is no doubt an important contribution to medicine,  but we must believe it is still a growing rather than a perfected science.  As Baha'u'llah has urged us to avail ourselves of the help of good  physicians Baha'is are certainly not only free to turn to psychiatry for  assistance but should, when available, do so. This does not mean  psychiatrists are always wise or always right; it means we are free to  avail ourselves of the best medicine has to offer us.\"            166: PSYCHIC PHENOMENA      \"With reference to psychic phenomena referred to in your letter; these, in  most cases, are an indication of a deep psychological disturbance. The  friends should avoid as much as possible giving undue consideration to  such matters.\"            167: PURE SOULS      \"Those who have never had any opportunity of hearing of the Faith but who  lived good lives will no doubt be treated with the greatest love and mercy  in the next world, and reap their full rewards.\"            168: PYRAMID PROPHECIES      \"We have nothing in our Baha'i Writings about the so-called Prophecies of  the Pyramids; so he (the Guardian) does not think you need attach any  importance to them.\"            169: PROMINENT FIGURES (LETTERS TO GOVERNMENT HEADS)      \"The Guardian feels that any communications addressed to international  figures of this nature, particularly in connection with political  proposals of any one group, should not be written unless approved by him.  He feels matters of this type so important that he does not wish such  communications sent without his prior consideration and approval. It may  lead to quite difficult and embarrassing situations, especially when the  letters are made public...\"            170: QUR'AN ('SALES' TRANSLATION RECOMMENDED)      \"As to the question raised by the Spiritual Assembly of Los Angeles  concerning the best English translation of the Qur'an, the Guardian would  recommend 'Sales' translation which is the most accurate rendering  available, and is the most widespread.\"            171: QUR'AN--STUDY OF (CONCERNING SCHOOL PROGRAM)      \"With regard to the school's program (Louhelen) for the next summer; the  Guardian would certainly advise, and even urge the friends to make a  thorough study of the Qur'an, as the knowledge of this sacred Scripture is  absolutely indispensable for every believer who wishes to adequately  understand and intelligently read, the writings of Baha'u'llah. Although  there are very few persons among Western Baha'is who are capable of  handling such a course in a scholarly way, the mere lack of such competent  teachers should encourage and stimulate the believers to get better  acquainted with the Sacred Scriptures of Islam. In this way, there will  gradually appear some distinguished Baha'is who will be so well versed in  the teachings of Islam as to be able to guide the believers in their study  of that religion.\"            172: QUR'AN, SURIHS OF THE      \"It is certainly most difficult to thoroughly grasp all the Surihs of the  Qur'an, as it requires a detailed knowledge of the social, religious and  historical background of Arabia at the time of the appearance of the  Prophet. The believers can not possibly hope, therefore, to understand the  Surihs after the first or even second or third reading. They have to study  them again and again, ponder over their meaning, with the help of certain  commentaries and explanatory notes as found, for instance, in the  admirable translation made by SALE, endeavor to acquire as clear and  correct understanding of their meaning and import as possible. This is  naturally a slow process, but future generations of believers will  certainly come to grasp it. For the present, the Guardian agrees, that it  would be easier and more helpful to study the Book according to subjects,  and note verse by verse and also in the light of the Bab, Baha'u'llah and  'Abdu'l-Baha's interpretation which throw such floods of light on the  whole of the Qur'an.\"            173: RELIGIOUS ASSOCIATIONS, NON-BAHA'I      \"Concerning membership in non-Baha'i religious associations, the Guardian  wishes to re-emphasize the general principle already laid down in his  communications to your Assembly and also to the individual believers that  no Baha'i who wishes to be a whole hearted and sincere upholder of the  distinguishing principles of the Cause can accept full membership in any  non-Baha'i ecclesiastical organization. For such an act would necessarily  imply only a partial acceptance of the Teachings and Laws of the Faith,  and an incomplete recognition of its independent status, and would thus be  tantamount to an act of disloyalty to the verities it enshrines. For it is  only too obvious that in most of its fundamental assumptions the Cause of  Baha'u'llah is completely at variance with outworn creeds, ceremonies, and  institutions. To be a Baha'i and at the same time accept membership in  another religious body is simply an act of contradiction that no sincere  and logically-minded person can possibly accept. To follow Baha'u'llah  does not mean accepting some of His teachings and rejecting the rest.  Allegiance to His Cause must be uncompromising and whole-hearted. During  the days of the Master the Cause was still in a stage that made such an  open and sharp disassociation between it and other religious  organizations, and particularly the Muslim Faith not only inadvisable but  practically impossible to establish. But since His passing, events  throughout the Baha'i World and particularly in Egypt where the Muslim  religious courts have formally testified to the independent character of  the Faith, have developed to a point that have made such an assertion of  the independence of the Cause not only highly desirable but absolutely  essential.\"            174: RESURRECTION (EXPLAINS THE PASSAGE ON PAGE 231 OF THE"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19271"],[0,"Dawn of a New Day (#13)"],[1,"for the unity, efficiency and zeal with which you  are labouring for the consolidation of the Administration throughout India  and Burma. He is convinced that your sustained and collective efforts in  this connection will soon result in ushering in a new era in the history  of the Cause in that country.          Correspondence with the Guardian      The N.S.A. should, indeed, advise the believers to lessen their  correspondence with the Guardian. But under no circumstances it can  prevent them from writing to him. For this is a sacred right and a supreme  privilege which every believer can rightly claim to possess, as through it  alone he can get in direct touch with his Guardian. If individuals feel,  after the advice of the N.S.A. to lessen correspondence, an inner urge to  write to the Guardian they should not be prevented or discouraged.          \"New-Era\" in Sindhi & Bengali Printed      Shoghi Effendi is delighted to learn that the Sindhi and the Bengali  translations of the \"New Era\" have been already sent to the press. He  hopes that the Hindi version will also be completed very soon. He is also  very pleased that the N.S.A. is taking the necessary steps for presenting  to the authorities the pamphlet regarding various laws and ordinances of  the Cause on matters of personal status. He sincerely hopes that the bill  you are planning to submit to the government will be approved. He is  eagerly awaiting to read the text himself.          Union With Loved Ones in the Next World      ...the possibility of securing union with his beloved in the next world is  one which the Baha'i Teachings are quite clear about. According to  Baha'u'llah the soul retains its individuality and consciousness after  death, and is able to commune with other souls. This communion, however,  is purely spiritual in character, and is conditioned upon the  disinterested and selfless love of the individuals for each other. Effort  in the Field of Teaching Urgently Required    [From the Guardian:]    The evidences of the rise, the consolidation, and expansion of the  Administrative Order of our beloved Faith in India and Burma are highly  significant and most encouraging. The incorporation of several local  Assemblies is of historic importance. Reproduction of all the Certificates  of Incorporation will adorn the pages of the forthcoming Biennial. Now  that the basis of Baha'i institutions has been firmly laid, an  unprecedented effort in the field of teaching is urgently required. Such  an effort is of vital and paramount importance. May the Almighty sustain,  inspire and guide you in this meritorious endeavour.    March 10, 1936    ...He would also appeal to all the friends to lend full and continued  support to the Cause of teaching throughout India. He would suggest that  those believers who have the means and the necessary physical  requirements, to settle in those localities where the light of the Cause  has not yet penetrated, with the view of establishing a new group. This,  he feels, is a very effective way of spreading the Cause in a vast and  exceptionally varied country like India.          Voting is Sacred Obligation      Regarding voting; it is not only the right but the sacred obligation of  every member of any Baha'i administrative body, whether permanent, or  temporary like the Convention, to fully and freely exercise this function.  Abstention from voting is, as a rule, not advisable, as it implies a  shirking of responsibility which every loyal and conscientious believer  should consider it a privilege to shoulder.          It is But a Beginning      [From the Guardian:]    The work thus far achieved, in both the teaching and administrative  spheres of Baha'i service, is highly reassuring and truly meritorious in  the sight of God. It is but a beginning however. Much remains to be  achieved. A systematic effort, aiming at the settlement of individual  believers in those states and provinces of India where the banner of the  Faith has not yet been hoisted, must be deliberately exerted and  vigorously sustained. Southern India particularly, the island of Ceylon  and other outlying centres on the fringe of the Indian Empire as well as  within its very heart should be won over, through your strenuous, constant  and devoted labours, to the ever-advancing Cause of Baha'u'llah. To extend  the outposts of our far-flung Faith should be your immediate objective.    May 31, 1936          Daidanaw Baha'i School      Much as he realizes the heavy and ever-increasing expenses which your  Assembly is incurring, particularly in these hard times, he feels  nevertheless the urge to impress upon you the vital necessity for the  Indian and Burmese believers to help in maintaining this Baha'i school in  Daidanaw which, in addition to the educational advantages it offers to the  Baha'is, can be of great help in promoting the cause of teaching  throughout Burma.    In view of that the Guardian wishes you to lay this matter before the  N.S.A. and to urge them to give it their careful consideration. He himself  is sending through the care of Siyyid Mustafa Roumie, thirty pounds as his  contribution towards the upkeep of the school at Daidanaw.    July 10, 1936          Two Main Principles to Follow      With regard to the problems confronting the believers; these, the Guardian  fully realizes, are by no means easy to solve. But the friends should be  confident that the very progress of the Cause will enable them to find the  necessary solution to the difficulties which appear now to so seriously  puzzle their minds.    There are two main principles which the Guardian wishes the friends to  always bear in mind and to conscientiously and faithfully follow. First is  the principle of unqualified and whole-hearted loyalty to the revealed  Word. The believers should be careful not to deviate, even a hair-breadth,  from the Teachings. Their supreme consideration should be to safeguard the  purity of the principles, tenets and laws of the Faith. It is only by this  means that they can hope to maintain the organic unity of the Cause. There  can and should be no liberals or conservatives, no moderates or extremes  in the Cause. For they are all subject to the one and the same law which  is the Law of God. This law transcends all differences, all personal or  local tendencies, moods and aspirations.    Next is the principle of complete, and immediate obedience to the  Assemblies, both local and national. It is the responsibility of these  Baha'i administrative bodies to enable the community to acquire, and  increasingly deepen in the knowledge and understanding of the Cause.  Doctrinal unity and administrative unity, these are the two chief pillars  that sustain the edifice of the Cause, and protect it from the storms of  opposition which so severely rage against it.    September 5, 1936          Visit of Mr. Schopflocher to India      I am addressing you these few lines on behalf of our beloved Guardian to  ask you to kindly inform your fellow-members in the Indian N.S.A. of the  happy news of the projected visit of dear Mr. Siegfried Schopflocher to  India, and to request you to take any step that your Assembly deems  advisable in order to make his journey as fruitful and abundant in its  results as possible.    Mr. Siegfried Schopflocher is not in need of any introduction, as his long  and manifold services to the Cause in America and particularly his  generous and unfailing support of the local, national as well as  international Baha'i funds, have endeared him to all the friends, whether  in the East or in the West.    For many years he has been a member of the American N.S.A. and he  contributed no small part in the steady development and consolidation of  the Administration ever since the early days of its establishment in the  States. He is indeed an outstanding champion of the Administration not  only in America but also in the West, and has proved in deeds his profound  attachment and loyalty to all its principles, laws and institutions.    His name will be ever associated with the beloved Temple in Wilmette. Had  it not been for the continued and whole-hearted support, both financial  and moral, which he so generously extended to it, that edifice could have  never been reared so steadily and efficiently. The friends will always  remember with deep gratitude the eminent services he has rendered the  Faith in this connection.    In view of these labours so devotedly accomplished, the Guardian wishes  your Assembly to urge the friends to draw full benefit from Mr.  Schopflocher's visit to India. He is confident that you will extend to him  a most hearty welcome, and will, through association with him, draw fresh  strength and inspiration in your arduous labours for the Cause.    September 25, 1936 Systematized and Nation-wide Teaching Campaign    Our beloved Guardian has read with intense interest and deepest  satisfaction your most welcome letter of the fifth October conveying to  him the joyful news of the teaching travels undertaken by Prof. Pritam  Singh and Dr. G.Y. Chitnis throughout India. He wishes you to congratulate  most warmly on his behalf these two distinguished friends upon their  determination to carry the Message to those numerous and varied sections  of the Indian population who have not received as yet the blessings which  the knowledge of the Cause confers. He is deeply grateful to them, and to  those who have, whether directly or indirectly, assisted them in the  pursuit of this truly noble aim.    The Guardian wishes also to express his heartfelt thanks to the Indian  N.S.A. for its splendid efforts for the extension of the teaching work  throughout India. The evidences of its warm and effective response to his  earnest appeal for the inauguration of a new systematized and nation-wide  teaching campaign in that country are indeed such as to give him fresh  hopes concerning the future expansion and"]]]
