Thus does Allah make clear His  communications for men that they may guard (against evil).    002.188  Y: And do not eat up your property among yourselves for vanities, nor  use it as bait for the judges, with intent that ye may eat up  wrongfully and knowingly a little of (other) people's property.    P: And eat not up your property among yourselves in vanity, nor seek by  it to gain the hearing of the judges that ye may knowingly devour a  portion of the property of others wrongfully.    S: And do not swallow up your property among yourselves by false means,  neither seek to gain access thereby to the judges, so that you may  swallow up a part of the property of men wrongfully while you know.    002.189  Y: They ask thee concerning the New Moons. Say: They are but signs to  mark fixed periods of time in (the affairs of) men, and for Pilgrimage.  It is no virtue if ye enter your houses from the back: It is virtue if  ye fear Allah. Enter houses through the proper doors: And fear Allah:  That ye may prosper.    P: They ask thee, (O Muhammad), of new moons, say: They are fixed  seasons for mankind and for the pilgrimage. It is not righteousness  that ye go to houses by the backs thereof (as do the idolaters at  certain seasons), but the righteous man is he who wardeth off (evil).  So go to houses by the gates thereof, and observe your duty to Allah,  that ye may be successful.    S: They ask you concerning the new moon. Say: They are times appointed  for (the benefit of) men, and (for) the pilgrimage; and it is not  righteousness that you should enter the houses at their backs, but  righteousness is this that one should guard (against evil); and go into  the houses by their doors and be careful (of your duty) to Allah, that  you may be successful.    002.190  Y: Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not  transgress limits; for Allah loveth not transgressors.    P: Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but  begin not hostilities. Lo! Allah loveth not aggressors.    S: And fight in the way of Allah with those who fight with you, and do  not exceed the limits, surely Allah does not love those who exceed the  limits.    002.191  Y: And slay them wherever ye catch them, and turn them out from where  they have Turned you out; for tumult and oppression are worse than  slaughter; but fight them not at the Sacred Mosque, unless they (first)  fight you there; but if they fight you, slay them. Such is the reward  of those who suppress faith.    P: And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places  whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter. And  fight not with them at the Inviolable Place of Worship until they first  attack you there, but if they attack you (there) then slay them. Such  is the reward of disbelievers.    S: And kill them wherever you find them, and drive them out from whence  they drove you out, and persecution is severer than slaughter, and do  not fight with them at the Sacred Mosque until they fight with you in  it, but if they do fight you, then slay them; such is the recompense of  the unbelievers.    002.192  Y: But if they cease, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.    P: But if they desist, then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.    S: But if they desist, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.    002.193  Y: And fight them on until there is no more Tumult or oppression, and  there prevail justice and faith in Allah; but if they cease, Let there  be no hostility except to those who practise oppression.    P: And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for  Allah. But if they desist, then let there be no hostility except  against wrong-doers.    S: And fight with them until there is no persecution, and religion  should be only for Allah, but if they desist, then there should be no  hostility except against the oppressors.    002.194  Y: The prohibited month for the prohibited month,- and so for all things  prohibited,- there is the law of equality. If then any one transgresses  the prohibition against you, Transgress ye likewise against him. But  fear Allah, and know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves.    P: The forbidden month for the forbidden month, and forbidden things in  retaliation. And one who attacketh you, attack him in like manner as he  attacked you. Observe your duty to Allah, and know that Allah is with  those who ward off (evil).    S: The Sacred month for the sacred month and all sacred things are  (under the law of) retaliation; whoever then acts aggressively against  you, inflict injury on him according to the injury he has inflicted on  you and be careful (of your duty) to Allah and know that Allah is with  those who guard (against evil).    002.195  Y: And spend of your substance in the cause of Allah, and make not your  own hands contribute to (your) destruction; but do good; for Allah  loveth those who do good.    P: Spend your wealth for the cause of Allah, and be not cast by your own  hands to ruin; and do good. Lo! Allah loveth the beneficent.    S: And spend in the way of Allah and cast not yourselves to perdition  with your own hands, and do good (to others); surely Allah loves the  doers of good.    002.196  Y: And complete the Hajj or 'umra in the service of Allah. But if ye are  prevented (From completing it), send an offering for sacrifice, such as  ye may find, and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches the  place of sacrifice. And if any of you is ill, or has an ailment in his  scalp, (Necessitating shaving), (He should) in compensation either  fast, or feed the poor, or offer sacrifice; and when ye are in peaceful  conditions (again), if any one wishes to continue the 'umra on to the  hajj, He must make an offering, such as he can afford, but if he cannot  afford it, He should fast three days during the hajj and seven days on  his return, Making ten days in all. This is for those whose household  is not in (the precincts of) the Sacred Mosque. And fear Allah, and  know that Allah Is strict in punishment.    P: Perform the pilgrimage and the visit (to Makka) for Allah. And if ye  are prevented, then send such gifts as can be obtained with ease, and  shave not your heads until the gifts have reached their destination.  And whoever among you is sick or hath an ailment of the head must pay a  ransom of fasting or almsgiving or offering. And if ye are in safety,  then whosoever contenteth himself with the visit for the pilgrimage  (shall give) such gifts as can be had with ease. And whosoever cannot  find (such gifts), then a fast of three days while on the pilgrimage,  and of seven when ye have returned; that is, ten in all. That is for  him whoso folk are not present at the Inviolable Place of Worship.  Observe your duty to Allah, and know that Allah is severe in  punishment.    S: And accomplish the pilgrimage and the visit for Allah, but if, you  are prevented, (send) whatever offering is easy to obtain, and do not  shave your heads until the offering reaches its destination; but  whoever among you is sick or has an ailment of the head, he (should  effect) a compensation by fasting or alms or sacrificing, then when you  are secure, whoever profits by combining the visit with the pilgrimage  (should take) what offering is easy to obtain; but he who cannot find  (any offering) should fast for three days during the pilgrimage and for  seven days when you return; these (make) ten (days) complete; this is  for him whose family is not present in the Sacred Mosque, and be  careful (of your duty) to Allah, and know that Allah is severe in  requiting (evil).    002.197  Y: For Hajj are the months well known. If any one undertakes that duty  therein, Let there be no obscenity, nor wickedness, nor wrangling in  the Hajj. And whatever good ye do, (be sure) Allah knoweth it. And take  a provision (With you) for the journey, but the best of provisions is  right conduct. So fear Me, O ye that are wise.    P: The pilgrimage is (in) the well-known months, and whoever is minded  to perform the pilgrimage therein (let him remember that) there is (to  be) no lewdness nor abuse nor angry conversation on the pilgrimage. And  whatsoever good ye do Allah knoweth it. So make provision for  yourselves (hereafter); for the best provision is to ward off evil.  Therefore keep your duty unto Me, O men of understanding.    S: The pilgrimage is (performed in) the well-known months; so whoever  determines the performance of the pilgrimage therein, there shall be no  intercourse nor fornication nor quarrelling amongst one another; and  whatever good you do, Allah knows it; and make provision, for surely  the provision is the guarding of oneself, and be careful (of your duty)  to Me, O men of understanding.    002.198  Y: It is no crime in you if ye seek of the bounty of your Lord (during  pilgrimage). Then when ye pour down from (Mount) Arafat, celebrate the  praises of Allah at the Sacred Monument, and celebrate His praises as  He has directed you, even though, before this, ye went astray.    P: It is no sin for you that ye seek the bounty of your Lord (by  trading). But, when ye press on in the multitude from 'Arafat, remember  Allah by the sacred monument. Remember Him as He hath guided you,  although before ye were of those astray.    S: There is no blame on you in seeking bounty from your Lord, so when  you hasten on from \"Arafat\", then remember Allah near the Holy  Monument, and remember Him as He has guided you, though before that you  were certainly of the erring ones.    002.199  Y: Then pass on at a quick pace from the place whence it is usual for  the multitude so to do, and ask for Allah's forgiveness. For Allah is  Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.    P: Then hasten onward from the place whence the multitude hasteneth"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16957"],[0,"Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tour (#13)"],[1," Mr. Sponge's (a docked dressing-gown), but wanting the outside  seaming, back strapping, and general strength that characterized Mr.  Sponge's. His waistcoat, of course, was a worked one--heart's-ease mingled  with foxes' heads, on a true blue ground, the gift of--we'll not say  who--his leathers were of the finest doe-skin, and his long-topped,  pointed-toed boots so thin as to put all idea of wet or mud out of the  question.    Such was the youth who now cantered up and took off his cap to the rank,  beauty, and fashion, assembled at Whirleypool Windmill. He then proceeded  to pay his respects in detail. At length, having exhausted his 'nothings,'  and said the same thing over again in a dozen different ways to a dozen  different ladies, he gave a slight jerk of the head to Tom Towler, who  forthwith whistled his hounds together, and attended by the whips, bustled  from the scene.    [Illustration: CAPTAIN GREATGUN]    Epping Hunt, in its most palmy days could not equal the exhibition that now  took place. Some of the more lively of the horses, tired of waiting,  perhaps pinched by the cold, for most of them were newly clipped, evinced  their approbation of the move, by sundry squeals and capers, which being  caught by others in the neighbourhood, the infection quickly spread, and in  less than a minute there was such a scene of rocking, and rearing, and  kicking, and prancing, and neighing and shooting over heads, and rolling  over tails, and hanging on by manes, mingled with such screamings from the  ladies in the flys, and such hearty-sounding kicks against splash boards  and fly bottoms, from sundry of the vicious ones in harness, as never was  witnessed. One gentleman, in a bran-new scarlet, mounted on a flourishing  piebald, late the property of Mr. Batty, stood pawing and fighting the air,  as if in the saw-dust circle, his unfortunate rider clinging round his  neck, expecting to have the beast back over upon him. Another little wiry  chestnut, with abundance of rings, racing martingale, and tackle generally,  just turned tail on the crowd and ran off home as hard as ever he could lay  legs to the ground; while a good steady bay cob, with a barrel like a butt,  and a tail like a hearth-brush, having selected the muddiest, dirtiest  place he could find, deliberately proceeded to lie down, to the horror of  his rider, Captain Greatgun, of the royal navy, who, feeling himself  suddenly touch mother earth, thought he was going to be swallowed up alive,  and was only awoke from the delusion by the shouts of the foot people,  telling him to get clear of his horse before he began to roll.    [Illustration]    Hercules would fain have joined the truant set, and, at the first  commotion, up went his great back, and down went his ears, with a single  lash out behind that meant mischief, but Mr. Sponge was on the alert, and  just gave him such a dig with his spurs as restored order, without exposing  anything that anybody could take notice of.    The sudden storm was quickly lulled. The spilt ones scrambled up; the loose  riders got tighter hold of their horses; the screaming fair ones sank  languidly in their carriages; and the late troubled ocean of equestrians  fell into irregular line _en route_ for the cover.    Bump, bump, bump; trot, trot, trot; jolt, jolt, jolt; shake, shake, shake;  and carriages and cavalry got to Ribston Wood somehow or other. It is a  long cover on a hill-side, from which parties, placing themselves in the  green valley below, can see hounds 'draw,' that is to say, run through with  their noses to the ground, if there are any men foolish enough to believe  that ladies care for seeing such things. However, there they were.    'Eu leu, in!' cries old Tom, with a wave of his arm, finding he can no  longer restrain the ardour of the pack as they approach, and thinking to  save his credit, by appearing to direct. 'Eu leu, in!' repeats he, with a  heartier cheer, as the pack charge the rotten fence with a crash that  echoes through the wood. The whips scuttle off to their respective points,  gentlemen feel their horses' girths, hats are thrust firmly on the head,  and the sherry and brandy flasks begin to be drained.    'Tally ho!' cries a countryman at the top of the wood, hoisting his hat on  a stick. At the magic sound, fear comes over some, joy over others, intense  anxiety over all. What commotion! What indecision! What confusion! 'Which  way?--Which way?' is the cry.    'Twang, twang, twang,' goes old Tom's horn at the top of the wood, whither  he seems to have flown, so quick has he got there.    A dark-coated gentleman on a good family horse solves the important  question--'Which way?'--by diving at once into the wood, crashing along  till he comes to a cross-road that leads to the top, when the scene opening  to 'open fresh fields and pastures new,' discloses divers other sections  struggling up in long drawn files, following other leaders, all puffing,  and wheezing and holding on by the manes, many feeling as if they had had  enough already--'Quick!' is the word, for the tail-hounds are flying the  fence out of the first field over the body of the pack, which are running  almost mute at best pace beyond, looking a good deal smaller than is  agreeable to the eyes of a sportsman.    'F--o--o--r--rard!' screams old Tom, flying the fence after them, followed  by jealous jostling riders in scarlet and colours, some anxious, some easy,  some wanting to be at it, some wanting to look as if they did, some wishing  to know if there was anything on the far side.    Now Tom tops another fence, rising like a rocket and dropping like a bird;  still 'F--o--o--r--rard!' is the cry--away they go at racing pace.    The field draws out like a telescope, leaving the largest portion at the  end, and many--the fair and fat ones in particular--seeing the hopelessness  of the case, pull up their horses, while yet on an eminence that commands a  view. Fifteen or twenty horsemen enter for the race, and dash forward,  though the hounds rather gain on old Tom, and the further they go the  smaller the point of the telescope becomes. The pace is awful; many would  give in but for the ladies. At the end of a mile or so, the determined ones  show to the front, and the spirters and 'make-believes' gladly avail  themselves of their pioneering powers.    Mr. Sponge, who got well through the wood, has been going at his ease, the  great striding brown throwing the large fields behind him with ease, and  taking his leaps safely and well. He now shows to the front, and old Tom,  who is still 'F--o--o--r--rarding' to his hounds, either rather falls back  to the field or the field draws upon him. At all events they get together  somehow. A belt of Scotch fir plantation, with a stiffish fence on each  side, tries their mettle and the stoutness of their hats: crash they get  through it, the noise they make among the thorns and rotten branches  resembling the outburst of a fire. Several gentlemen here decline under  cover of the trees.    'F--o--o--r--rard!' screams old Tom, as he dives through the stiff fence  and lands in the field outside the plantation. He might have saved his  breath, for the hounds were beating him as it was. Mr. Sponge bores through  the same place, little aided, however, by anything old Tom has done to  clear the way for him, and the rest follow in his wake.    The field is now reduced to six, and two of the number, Mr. Spareneck and  Caingey Thornton, become marked in their attention to our hero. Thornton is  riding Mr. Waffles' crack steeple-chaser 'Dare-Devil,' and Mr. Spareneck is  on a first-rate hunter belonging to the same gentleman, but they have not  been able to get our friend Sponge into grief. On the contrary, his horse,  though lathered goes as strong as ever, and Mr. Sponge, seeing their  design, is as careful of him as possible, so as not to lose ground. His  fine, strong, steady seat, and quiet handling, contrasts well with  Thornton's rolling bucketing style, who has already begun to ply a heavy  cutting whip, in aid of his spurs at his fences, accompanied with a half  frantic 'g--u--r--r--r along!' and inquires of the horse if he thinks he  stole him?    The three soon get in front; fast as they go, the hounds go faster, and  fence after fence is thrown behind them, just as a girl throws her  skipping-rope.    Tom and the whips follow, grinning with their tongues in their cheeks, Tom  still screeching 'F--o--o--o--rard!--F--o--o--o--rard!' at intervals.    A big stone wall, built with mortar, and coped with heavy blocks of stone,  is taken by the three abreast, for which they are rewarded by a gallop up  Stretchfurrow pasture, from the summit of which they see the hounds  streaming away to a fine grass country below, with pollard willows dotted  here and there in the bottom.    'Water!' says our friend Sponge to himself, wondering whether Hercules  would face it. A desperate black bullfinch, so thick that they could hardly  see through it, is shirked by consent, for a gate which a countryman opens,  and another fence or two being passed, the splashing of some hounds in the  water, and the shaking of others on the opposite bank, show that, as  usual, the willows are pretty true prophets.    Caingey, grinning his coarse red face nearly double, and getting his horse  well by the head, rams in the spurs, and flourishes his cutting whip high  in air, with a 'g--u--u--ur along! do you think I'--the 'stole you' being  lost under water just as Sponge clears the brook a little lower down.  Spareneck then pulls up.    When Nimrod had Dick Christian under water in the Whissendine in his  Leicestershire run, and someone more humane than the rest of the field  observed, as they rode on,    'But he'll be drowned.'    'Shouldn't wonder,' exclaimed another.    'But the pace,' Nimrod added, 'was too good to inquire.'    Such, however, was not the case with our watering-place cock, Mr. Sponge. "]]]
