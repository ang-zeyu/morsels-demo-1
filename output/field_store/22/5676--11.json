[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17928"],[0,"The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany (#13)"],[1,"ond. 1876, p. 105) is the subject of  the poem \"Des Buessers Laeuterungswahn,\" p. 285. The selfish greed of the  Brahmans (cf. _Manu_, vii. 133, 144; xi. 40) is referred to in two poems  on p. 287. The supposed powers of _cintamani_, the Hindu wishing-stone,  suggested the poem on p. 275 (cf. Bhartrhari, _Vair._ 33). Of other  poems of this sort we may mention \"Die Gottverehrung des Stammes  Karian,\" p. 322 (Ritter, _Erdk._ iv. 1. p. 187), \"Vom Genuss der Fruechte  nach Dschainas Lehre,\" p. 307 (ibid. iv. p. 749), and \"Die Schuhe im  Tempel Madhuras,\" p. 301 (ibid. iv. 2. p. 4).           *       *       *       *       *    Again, many poems belong to the realm of physical and descriptive  geography. Their source, in most cases, was undoubtedly the great  geographical work of Ritter. To it may be referred the majority of the  purely descriptive poems, e.g., \"Das ewige Fruehlingsland der Tudas,\" p.  301 (op. cit. iv. 1. 951), \"Das Fruehlingsland Kaschmir,\" p. 315 (ibid.  ii. 1142 and 630), \"Die Kokospalme,\" p. 304 (ibid. iv. 1. 834 seq., 838,  851, 852). The sun and moon lotuses, so famous through Heine's beautiful  songs (see p. 58), are described on p. 343. Animal-life also comes in  for its share, e.g. the ichneumon in \"Instinctive Heilkunde der Tiere,\"  p. 336.           *       *       *       *       *    Lastly, we come to the historical group, poems relating to the history  of India. The poem on the burning of Keteus' wife, p. 382, is evidently  inspired by the reading of Diodorus Siculus (xix. 33). On page 311 we  have a poem celebrating the valor of the Raja Pratap Singh, who held out  so bravely against Akbar in the mountain fastnesses of Citor, 1567.[184]  The heroic queen-regent of Ahmadnagar, Chand Bibi, and the romantic  story of her struggle against Akbar, in 1596, is the subject of the poem  on p. 353. Only the bright side is, however, presented; the tragic fate  which overtook the unfortunate princess three years later is not  referred to.[185] The famous battle of Samugarh, 1658, by which  Aurangzib gained the Mogul Empire, is narrated on p. 310, according to  the account of Bernier.[186] In this connection we may also mention \"Das  Mikroskop,\" p. 370, the familiar anecdote of the Brahman who refused to  drink water, after the microscope had revealed to him the existence  therein of countless animalcules (Ritter, _Erdk._ iv. 1. p. 749).           *       *       *       *       *    Besides the poems falling under the groups discussed above there are  many of purely didactic or moralizing tendency, embodying general  reflections. It would take us too far, were we to attempt to discuss  them, even if their interest were sufficiently great to repay the  trouble. We must, however, point out that even the Sanskrit vocabulary  is impressed into service to furnish material for such poems. Thus the  fact that the word _pada_ may mean either \"foot,\" \"step,\" or \"ray of  the moon or sun,\" is utilized for the last lines of \"Vom Monde,\" p. 368.  The meaning of the term _bakravratin_, \"acting like a crane,\" applied to  a hypocrite, is used for a poem on p. 363. Similarly the threefold  signification of _dvipa_ as \"brahman,\" \"bird,\" and \"tooth\" suggests  \"Zweigeboren,\" p. 423, and more instances might be adduced. It is not to  be wondered at that such poetizing should often degenerate into the most  inane trifling, so that we get such rhyming efforts as that on p. 326  with its pun on the similarity of _hima_ \"winter\" with _hema_ \"gold,\"  _Himalaya_ and _himavat_ with _Himmel_ and _Heimat_, or that on p. 385  with its childish juxtaposition of the Vedantic term _maya_, the Greek  name _Maia_, and the German word _Magie_.           *       *       *       *       *    If the poems discussed in the preceding pages were found to be largely  didactic and gnomic in character, the great collection called _Die  Weisheit des Brahmanen_ is entirely so. The poems composing this bulky  work appeared in installments during the period 1836-1839, and, while  many of them, as will be shown below, are the outcome of Rueckert's  Oriental studies, the majority simply embody general reflections on  anything and everything that happened to engage the poet's attention.  \"Es muss alles hinein, was ich eben lese: vor acht Wochen Spinoza, vor  vierzehn Tagen Astronomie, jetzt Grimms ueberschwenglich gehaltreiche  Deutsche Mythologie, alles unter der nachlaessig vorgehaltenen  Brahmanenmaske....\"[187] These are the author's own words and render  further detailed characterization of the work superfluous. It is well  known that the sources for the great didactic collection, even for that  part of it which is not composed of reflections on matters of  contemporary history, politics and literature, or relating to questions  of family and friendship, are more Occidental than Oriental.[188] In  fact, the Brahmanic character of the wisdom here expounded consists  mainly in the contemplative spirit of reposeful didacticism which  pervades the entire collection. Nor is there anything Oriental about  the form of the poems,--the rhymed Alexandrine reigning supreme with  wearisome monotony.    A detailed discussion of the _Weisheit_, therefore, even if it were  possible within the limits of this dissertation, will not be attempted;  the less so, as such a discussion, so far as the Oriental side, at  least, is concerned, would be very much of the same nature as that given  of the _Brahmanische Erzaehlungen_. A general Oriental influence,  especially of the _Bhagavadgita_-philosophy or of Rumi's pantheism, is  noticeable enough in many places,[189] but particular instances of such  influence are not hard to find. We shall adduce only a few, taken from  the fifth division or _Stufe_, called _Leben_. Of these there are taken  from the _Hitopadesa_ Nos. 25 (_Hit._ i. couplet 179; tr. Hertel, 141),  26 (ib. i. 178; tr. Hertel, 140), 111 (ib. i. couplet 80; Wilkins' tr.  p. 56). From the _Gulistan_ are taken Nos. 290 (_Gul._ i. 13; K.S. dist.  p. 42), 326 (ibid. vii. 20; K.S. dist. p. 230), 366 (ibid. vii. 20; K.S.  p. 232). No. 60 was probably suggested by the fable of the ass and the  camel in Jami's _Baharistan_ (tr. K.S. p. 179). No. 476 draws a moral  from the fact that the Persian title _mirza_ means either \"scribe\" or  \"prince,\" according to its position before or behind the person's name.  In No. 201 we recognize a Persian proverb: [Arabic] \"little goat, do not  die; spring is coming, you will eat clover.\" No. 364:        \"Herr Strauss, wenn ein Kameel du bist, so trage mir!\"      Ich bin ein Vogel. \"Flieg!\" Ich bin ein Trampeltier    is also a Persian proverb and is absolutely unintelligible, unless one  happens to know that the Persian word for \"ostrich\" is [Arabic], literally  \"camel-bird.\"    Again, to cite from other _Stufen_, Firdausi's lines, already used by  Goethe in his _Divan_ (see p. 25 above), furnish the text for a moral  poem, p. 487 (18). The Persian notion of the peacock being ashamed of  his ugly feet (cf. _Gul._ ii. 8, _qit'ah_) is put to a similar use on p.  463 (162). Some poems are moralizingly descriptive of Indic customs,  e.g., p. 157 (11), where reverence for the _guru_ or \"teacher\" is  inculcated (cf. _Manu_ ii, 71, 228) and pp. 10, 11 (18, 19), where the  conditions are set forth under which the Vedas may be read (cf. _Manu_  iv. 101-126, or _Yajn._ i. 142-151). A comparison is instituted between  the famous court of Vikramaditya and his seven gems, of which Kalidasa  was one, and that of Karl August of Weimar and his poetic circle, p. 148  (39).    Trivial and empty rhyming is of course abundant in such an uncritical  mass of verse, and we also meet with insipid puns, like that on the  Arabic word _din_, \"religion,\" and the German word _dienen_, p. 498  (48).    These examples, we believe, will suffice for our purpose. With the  philosophical part of the _Weisheit_ we are not here concerned.           *       *       *       *       *    A great many Oriental poems are scattered throughout the collection  which bears the title of _Pantheon_ (vol. vii.). We may mention \"Die  gefallenen Engel,\" p. 286, the legend of Harut and Marut, \"Wischnu auf  der Schlange,\" p. 286, \"Die nackten Weisen,\" p. 287, and others. Some  poems in this collection are in spirit akin to the _Oestliche Rosen_,  e.g. \"Becher und Wein,\" p. 291, \"Der Traum,\" p. 283, and the  \"Vierzeilen,\" pp. 481, 482. Besides this, the _gazal_-form occurs  repeatedly, e.g. \"Fruehlingshymne,\" p. 273. So fond does Rueckert seem to  have been of this form, that he employs it even for a poem on such an  unoriental subject as Easter, p. 189 (2).    This collection is furthermore of interest from the biographical side,  as often giving us Rueckert's opinions. Thus we find evidence that he was  by no means onesidedly prejudiced in favor of things Oriental. Referring  to the myth of fifty-three million Apsarases having sprung from the  sea,[190] he states (p. 24), that if he were to be the judge, these  fifty-three million nymphs bedecked with jewels would have to bow before  the one Aphrodite in her naked glory. And again in \"Rueckkehr,\" p. 51,  the poet confesses that having wandered to the East to forget his misery  and finding thorns in the rose-gardens of Persia, and demons, misshapen  gods and monkeys acting the parts of heroes in India, he is glad to  return to the Iliad and Odyssey (cf. also \"Zu den oestlichen Rosen,\" p.  153).    Rueckert was evidently aware of his tendency to overproduction. He offers  an explanation in \"Spruchartiges,\" p. 157:        Mir ist Verse zu machen und kuenstliche Vers' ein Beduerfnis,      Fehlt mir ein eigenes Lied, so uebersetz' ich mir eins.    And again to his own question, Musst du denn immer dichten?, p. 159, he  answers:        Ich denke nie ohne zu dichten,      Und dichte nie ohne zu denken.    Graf von Schack has aptly applied to Rueckert's poems the famous sentence  which a Spaniard pronounced about Lope de Vega,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],[0,"The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#13)"],[1," From his pocket the took out a knife containing a number of implements,  amongst them a hook-like contrivance.    \"Have you a button-hook, Petrie,\" he asked, \"or anything of that nature?\"    \"How will this do?\" said the Inspector, and he produced a pair of  handcuffs. \"They were not wanted,\" he added significantly.    \"Better still,\" declared Smith.    Reclosing his knife, he took the handcuffs from Weymouth, and,  returning to the sitting-room, opened them widely and inserted two  steel points in the hollows of the golden pomegranates. He pulled.  There was a faint sound of moving mechanism and the wooden lid lifted,  revealing the interior of the coffer. It contained three long bars of  lead--and nothing else!    Supporting the lid with the handcuffs--    \"Just pull the light over here, Petrie,\" said Smith.    I did as he directed.    \"Look into these two cavities where one is expected to thrust one's  fingers!\"    Weymouth and I craned forward so that our heads came into contact.    \"My God!\" whispered the Inspector, \"we know now what killed him!\"    Visible, in either little cavity against the edge of the steel  handcuff, was the point of a needle, which evidently worked in an  exquisitely made socket through which the action of raising the lid  caused it to protrude. Underneath the lid, midway between the two  pomegranates, as I saw by slowly moving the lamp, was a little  receptacle of metal communicating with the base of the hollow needles.    The action of lifting the lid not only protruded the points but also  operated the hypodermic syringe!    \"Note,\" snapped Smith--but his voice was slightly hoarse.    He removed the points of the bracelets. The box immediately reclosed  with no other sound than a faint click.    \"God forgive him,\" said Smith, glancing toward the other room, \"for  he died in my stead!--and Dr. Fu-Manchu scores an undeserved failure!\"        CHAPTER XV    ZARMI REAPPEARS      \"Come in!\" I cried.    The door opened and a page-boy entered.    \"A cable for Dr. Petrie.\"    I started up from my chair. A thousand possibilities--some of a sort  to bring dread to my heart--instantly occurred to me. I tore open the  envelope and, as one does, glanced first at the name of the sender.    It was signed \"Karamaneh!\"    \"Smith!\" I said hoarsely, glancing over the massage, \"Karamaneh is on  her way to England. She arrives by the _Nicobar_ to-morrow!\"    \"Eh?\" cried Nayland Smith, in turn leaping to his feet. \"She had no  right to come alone, unless----\"    The boy, open-mouthed, was listening to our conversation, and I  hastily thrust a coin into his hand and dismissed him. As the door  closed--    \"Unless what, Smith?\" I said, looking my friend squarely in the eyes.    \"Unless she has learnt something, or--is flying away from some one!\"    My mind set in a whirl of hopes and fears, longings and dreads.    \"What do you mean, Smith?\" I asked. \"This is the place of danger, as  we know to our cost; she was safe in Egypt.\"    Nayland Smith commenced one of his restless perambulations, glancing  at me from time to time and frequently tugging at the lobe of his ear.    \"_Was_ she safe in Egypt?\" he rapped. \"We are dealing, remember, with  the Si-Fan, which, if I am not mistaken, is a sort of Eleusinian  Mystery holding some kind of dominion over the eastern mind, and  boasting initiates throughout the Orient. It is almost certain that  there is an Egyptian branch, or group--call it what you will--of the  damnable organization.\"    \"But Dr. Fu-Manchu----\"    \"Dr. Fu-Manchu--for he lives, Petrie! my own eyes bear witness to the  fact--Dr. Fu-Manchu is a sort of delegate from the headquarters. His  prodigious genius will readily enable him to keep in touch with every  branch of the movement, East and West.\"    He paused to knock out his pipe into an ashtray and to watch me for  some moments in silence.    \"He may have instructed his Cairo agents,\" he added significantly.    \"God grant she get to England in safety,\" I whispered. \"Smith! can we  make no move to round up the devils who defy us, here in the very  heart of civilized England? Listen. You will not have forgotten the  wild-cat Eurasian Zarmi?\"    Smith nodded. \"I recall the lady perfectly!\" he snapped.    \"Unless my imagination has been playing me tricks, I have seen her  twice within the last few days--once in the neighborhood of this hotel  and once in a cab in Piccadilly.\"    \"You mentioned the matter at the time,\" said Smith shortly; \"but  although I made inquiries, as you remember, nothing came of them.\"    \"Nevertheless, I don't think I was mistaken. I feel in my very bones  that the Yellow hand of Fu-Manchu is about to stretch out again. If  only we could apprehend Zarmi.\"    Nayland Smith lighted his pipe with care.    \"If only we could, Petrie!\" he said; \"but, damn it!\"--he dashed his  left fist into the palm of his right hand--\"we are doomed to remain  inactive. We can only await the arrival of Karamaneh and see if she  has anything to tell us. I must admit that there are certain theories  of my own which I haven't yet had an opportunity of testing. Perhaps  in the near future such an opportunity may arise.\"    How soon that opportunity was to arise neither of us suspected then;  but Fate is a merry trickster, and even as we spoke of these matters  events were brewing which were to lead us along strange paths.    With such glad anticipations as my pen cannot describe, their gladness  not unmixed with fear, I retired to rest that night, scarcely  expecting to sleep, so eager was I for the morrow. The musical voice  of Karamaneh seemed to ring in my ears; I seemed to feel the touch  of her soft hands and to detect, as I drifted into the borderland  betwixt reality and slumber, that faint, exquisite perfume which from  the first moment of my meeting with the beautiful Eastern girl, had  become to me inseparable from her personality.    It seemed that sleep had but just claimed me when I was awakened by  some one roughly shaking my shoulder. I sprang upright, my mind alert  to sudden danger. The room looked yellow and dismal, illuminated as it  was by a cold light of dawn which crept through the window and with  which competed the luminance of the electric lamps.    Nayland Smith stood at my bedside, partially dressed!    \"Wake up, Petrie!\" he cried; \"you instincts serve you better than my  reasoning. Hell's afoot, old man! Even as you predicted it, perhaps in  that same hour, the yellow fiends were at work!\"    \"What, Smith, what!\" I said, leaping out of bed; \"you don't mean----\"    \"Not that, old man,\" he replied, clapping his hand upon my shoulder;  \"there is no further news of _her_, but Weymouth is waiting outside.  Sir Baldwin Frazer has disappeared!\"    I rubbed my eyes hard and sought to clear my mind of the vapors of  sleep.    \"Sir Baldwin Frazer!\" I said, \"of Half-Moon Street? But what----\"    \"God knows _what_,\" snapped Smith; \"but our old friend Zarmi, or so it  would appear, bore him off last night, and he has completely vanished,  leaving practically no trace behind.\"    Only a few sleeping servants were about as we descended the marble  stairs to the lobby of the hotel where Weymouth was awaiting us.    \"I have a cab outside from the Yard,\" he said. \"I came straight here  to fetch you before going on to Half-Moon Street.\"    \"Quite right!\" snapped Smith; \"but you are sure the cab is from the  Yard? I have had painful experience of strange cabs recently!\"    \"You can trust this one,\" said Weymouth, smiling slightly. \"It has  carried me to the scene of many a crime.\"    \"Hem!\" said Smith--\"a dubious recommendation.\"    We entered the waiting vehicle and soon were passing through the  nearly deserted streets of London. Only those workers whose toils  began with the dawn were afoot at that early hour, and in the misty  gray light the streets had an unfamiliar look and wore an aspect of  sadness in ill accord with the sentiments which now were stirring  within me. For whatever might be the fate of the famous mental  specialist, whatever the mystery before us--even though Dr. Fu-Manchu  himself, malignantly active, threatened our safety--Karamaneh would  be with me again that day--Karamaneh, my beautiful wife to be!    So selfishly occupied was I with these reflections that I paid little  heed to the words of Weymouth, who was acquainting Nayland Smith with  the facts bearing upon the mysterious disappearance of Sir Baldwin  Frazer. Indeed, I was almost entirely ignorant upon the subject when  the cab pulled up before the surgeon's house in Half-Moon Street.    Here, where all else spoke of a city yet sleeping or but newly  awakened, was wild unrest and excitement. Several servants were  hovering about the hall eager to glean any scrap of information that  might be obtainable; wide-eyed and curious, if not a little fearful.  In the somber dining-room with its heavy oak furniture and gleaming  silver, Sir Baldwin's secretary awaited us. He was a young man,  fair-haired, clean-shaven and alert; but a real and ever-present  anxiety could be read in his eyes.    \"I am sorry,\" he began, \"to have been the cause of disturbing you at  so early an hour, particularly since this mysterious affair may prove  to have no connection with the matters which I understand are at  present engaging your attention.\"    Nayland Smith raised his hand deprecatingly.    \"We are prepared, Mr. Logan,\" he replied, \"to travel to the uttermost  ends of the earth at all times, if by doing so we can obtain even a  meager clue to the enigma which baffles us.\"    \"I should not have disturbed Mr. Smith,\" said Weymouth, \"if I had not  been pretty sure that there was Chinese devilry at work here: nor  should I have told you as much as I have, Mr. Logan,\" he added, a  humorous twinkle creeping into his blue eyes, \"if I had thought you  could not be of use to us in unraveling our case!\"    \"I quite understand that,\" said Logan, \"and now, since you have voted  for the"]]]
