It is remarkable that amongst  nearly all nations, either alcohol in some form or one of the stronger  alkaloids is in common use. From this fact it is sometimes argued that  stimulants must supply a physiological need. The same method of reasoning  will apply with greater force to the use of condiments. Such conclusions  appear to us to be scarcely warranted. If the extensive or even universal  practice of a thing proves its necessity, then has there been  justification, either now or in the past, for war, lying, avarice and  other vices. It is strange that drugs differing so greatly in their  immediate and obvious effects as, for example, alcohol and opium, or  coffee and tobacco should be used. Should it he said that only some of the  much used stimulants are useful, there is an end to the argument based on  their universal use. There is no doubt that the use of stimulants in more  than very small quantities is distinctly injurious, and it is difficult to  see what physiological advantage there can be in their habitual use, to  what is vaguely called a moderate extent. Sometimes they are taken for a  supposed medical necessity, and where taste attracts, little evidence  satisfies. Those in the habit of taking them, if honest, must confess that  it is chiefly on account of the apparent enjoyment. The ill-nourished and  the depressed in body and mind crave most for stimulants. A food creates  energy in the body, including the nervous system, and this is the only  legitimate form of stimulation. A mere stimulant does not create but draws  on the reserve forces. What was latent energy--to become in the natural  course gradually available--under stimulation is rapidly set free; there  is consequently, subsequent depletion of energy. There may occasionally be  times when a particular organ needs a temporary stimulus to increased  action, notwithstanding it may suffer an after depression; but such cases  are so rare that they may be left out of our present argument, and  stimulants should only be used, like other powerful drugs, under medical  advice. In the last 25 years the use of alcohol by the medical profession  has steadily diminished, its poisonous properties having become more  evident.    There is a general similarity in the effects of stimulants on the  digestive and nervous systems. The most largely used stimulant is ethyl  alcohol, and as its action is best known, it may be useful to name the  principal effects. Alcohol in the form of wine and spirits, in small  quantities, first stimulates the digestive organs. Large quantities  inflame the stomach and stop digestion. (Beer, however, retards digestion,  altogether out of proportion to the alcohol it contains.) Alcohol  increases the action of the heart, increases the blood pressure, and  causes the vessels of the whole body to dilate, especially those of the  skin; hence there is a feeling of warmth. It the person previously felt  cold he now feels warm. The result of the increased circulation through  the various organs is that they work with greater vigour, hence the mental  faculties are brightened for a time, and the muscular strength seems  increased. The person usually feels the better for it, though this is not  always the case; some have a headache or feel very sleepy. It has been  repeatedly proved that these good results are but transitory. The heart,  although at first stimulated, is more exhausted after the action of the  alcohol has passed away than it was at first. This is true of all the  organs of the body which were stimulated. In consequence of the dilatation  of the blood vessels of the skin, an unusual quantity of heat is lost and  the body is cooled. After taking alcohol persons are less able to stand  cold. When overtaken by snowstorms or subjected to excessive or prolonged  cold, it has often happened that those who resorted to spirit drinking  have succumbed, whilst the others have survived. Insurance statistics  have conclusively shown that teetotallers are longer livers than the  so-called moderate drinkers. The terrible effects on both body and mind of  the excessive drinking of alcohol, or the use of other strong stimulants  or narcotics, are too obvious to need allusion to here; we are only  concerned with what is vaguely called their moderate use.    The stimulation produced by tea and coffee is in some respects like that  of alcohol. The heart is stimulated and the blood pressure rises. The  kidneys are strongly affected in those unaccustomed to the drug, but this  ceases after a week or more of use. Their chief effect is on the brain and  nervous system.    Many have boasted that they can take of what they call the good things of  life to their full, without any bad effect, and looking over a few years,  or even many years, it seems a fact. Some of us have known of such men,  who have been esteemed for their joviality and good nature, who have  suddenly broken down at what should have been a hearty middle life. On the  other hand there are men who were badly equipped for the battle of life,  with indifferent constitutions, who never had the buoyancy and overflow of  animal spirits, but who with care have long outlived all their formerly  more robust but careless companions.    Simple versus Highly-flavoured Foods.--It is very difficult to decide to  what extent condiments and flavourings should be used. These have  stimulating properties, although differing from the more complex  properties of alcohol and the alkaloids. The great differences in the  dietetic practices of nations does not appear to be in conformity with any  general rule. It varies with opportunity, climate and national  temperament; though doubtless the national temperament is often due in  part to the dietetic habits. Some races are content with the simplest  foods, large numbers subsist chiefly on rice, others on the richer  cereals, wheat, oatmeal, etc., and fruit. On the other hand there are  races who enjoy stronger flavoured food, including such things as garlic,  curry, pickles, pepper, strong cheese, meat extracts, rancid fats, dried  and smoked fish, high game or still more decomposed flesh, offal and  various disgusting things. The Greenlanders will eat with the keenest  appetite, the half-frozen, half-putrid head and fins of the seal, after  it has been preserved under the grass of summer. In Burmah and Sumatra a  mess is made by pounding together prawns, shrimps, or any cheap fish; this  is frequently allowed to become partially putrid. It is largely used as a  condiment for mixing with their rice. Numerous examples of this sort could  be given. There is scarcely anything that it is possible to eat, but has  been consumed with relish by some tribe or other. The strongest flavoured,  and to our minds most disgusting foods are eaten by the least intelligent  and most brutal races. It is hunger that compels the poor African bushman  to eat anything he can get, and the Hottentot not only the flesh, but the  entrails of cattle which die naturally, and this last he has come to think  exquisite when boiled in beast-blood. All this shows a wonderful range of  adaptability in the human body, but it would not be right to say that all  such food is equally wholesome. The most advanced and civilised races,  especially the more delicately organised of them are the most fastidious,  whilst it is the most brutal, that take the most rank and strongly  flavoured foods. Even amongst the civilised there are great differences.  The assimilative and nervous systems can be trained to tolerate injurious  influences to a remarkable degree. A striking example is seen in the  nausea commonly produced by the first pipe of tobacco, and the way the  body may in time be persuaded, not only to tolerate many times such a  quantity without manifesting any unpleasant feelings, but to receive  pleasure from the drug. Opium or laudanum may be taken in gradually  increasing quantities, until such a dose is taken as would at first have  produced death, yet now without causing any immediate or very apparent  harm. Nearly all drugs loose much of their first effect on continued use.  Not only is this so, but a sudden discontinuance of a drug may cause  distress, as the body, when free from the artificial stimulation to which  it has become habituated, falls into a sluggish or torpid condition. For  the enjoyment of food two things are equally necessary, a healthy and keen  appetite and suitable food; without the first no food, however good and  skilfully prepared, will give satisfaction. The sense of taste resides in  certain of the papilloe of the tongue, and to a much less degree in the  palate. Tastes may be classified into sweet, bitter, acid and saline.  Sweet tastes are best appreciated by the tip, acid by the side, and bitter  by the back of the tongue. Hot or pungent substances produce sensations of  general feeling, which obscure any strictly gustatory sensations which may  be present at the same time. To affect the taste the food must enter into  solution. Like the other senses, taste may be rendered more delicate by  cultivation. Flavours are really odours, and the word smell would be more  appropriate. For example, what we call the taste of an onion, the flavour  of fruit, etc. (independent of the sweetness or sourness of the fruit) is  due to the nose.    Much has been written on the necessity of making food tasty, so as to  stimulate the appetite and digestion. It is urged that unless this is done  food will not be eaten in sufficient quantity. Innumerable receipts (some  very elaborate) have been published for this purpose. All this is supposed  to increase the enjoyment of food. The Anglo-Saxon race--the race whose  dietary is the most elaborate--is especially subject to digestive  derangements, and without good digestion and the consequent healthy  appetite, no food will give full gustatory"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15240"],[0,"A Journal of a Tour in the Congo Free State (#13)"],[1,"on is a forest through which runs a narrow native tract. This  demonstrates well the extreme indolence of the native. If a small branch  of a tree falls across the path, he steps over it, if a large one, he  walks round it. Time is no object, so the length of the road is  immaterial. No attempt is made to form bridges, for the streams are not  deep and are easily fordable, nor even to break off the branches of  trees which obstruct the way. It is easier to stoop and pass beneath.  The forest paths have indeed been made simply by the pressure of bare  feet on the soil and undergrowth. A few monkeys and parrots chatter  overhead and an occasional pigeon coos, but the chief forms of animal  life here, are thousands of the most lovely butterflies. These are  coloured to suit the surroundings and are therefore usually of subdued  tints. Occasionally however, a great insect nearly as large as one's  hand, flies by exhibiting the most vivid greens, reds, and blues.  Bananas, rubber plants, palms and acacias crowd each other in the forest  through which we walk for three or four miles, until we reach a native  village consisting of a few square huts in a clearing. A handsome  looking fellow comes up to us, salutes and desires to know if we wish to  buy anything. Having neither mitakos, salt, nor cloth except the  pyjamas we are wearing, we cannot deal and leave the man wondering  probably--if the native ever does wonder--why we walked all that  distance if we did not require anything.    On August 8th we visit the Botanical Gardens at Eala, which is about  three miles from Coquilhatville. Mr. Pinard, the Director of the  Gardens, shows us the various plants indigenous and imported which he  has collected, and although the place has only been formed for three  years, almost everything which could possibly grow has been planted. The  soil is sandy, the altitude about 1100 feet above sea level and the  temperature is about 90 deg. F. Numerous varieties of rubber plants are  arranged here for experimental purposes, and gutta percha also is slowly  attaining maturity. Bushes which yield acid, suitable for coagulating  the milk of the rubber plant, grow alongside. Cotton does not do well  here owing to the scarcity of rain, but coffee and tea flourish. All the  palms, many ferns and orchids and nearly every fruit and vegetable,  European as well as tropical, grow in great profusion while the melons,  vegetable marrows, beans, peas, potatoes, lettuces, cucumbers and  tomatoes look healthy. Croton, belladonna and other medicinal herbs are  cultivated and there are many beautiful flowers, whose use is chiefly  ornamental. The gardens are of great extent, well laid out and  beautifully kept, so that it is difficult to believe that four years ago  this site was wild forest.    Adjoining the gardens is a large farm in which cattle, resembling those  of the Lower Congo, look well. It is however, unfortunate that the cows  only give sufficient milk to rear their calves. Horses, asses and pigs  live healthily and the native sheep thrive, but are very thin. Although  wheat will not grow, maize is easily raised and the grass, if coarse  looking, is good for grazing. The farm buildings are kept most  scrupulously clean, for the slightest neglect would probably occasion an  epidemic of trichinosis among the pigs.    The villages in the neighbourhood of Coquilhatville seem very populous  and prosperous. Any morning early whole families can be met--father,  mother and children, with bundles of manioc fastened on their backs by  broad grass fibres--going to the town. Everywhere the natives seem  contented and happy. When not working, they sit in the roads and dye  their skins or have their hair dressed, while the children play around  with bows and arrows or other pugnacious kind of toys. The wealthy wear  heavy brass rings extending from the ankle to the knee and the  discomfort must be very great, but as is proved by the tatouage, the  natives will bear much pain in order to beautify themselves. Before  leaving Coquilhatville, we send for the boy Epondo, who was rendered  famous as an example of an atrocity by Mr. Casement, the late British  Consul at Boma. Epondo is now employed as a gardener by the Commissaire  of the District and is always at hand when visitors desire to see him.  Four inches below the elbow joint of the left arm there are two deeps  scars, three inches apart, which could certainly have been produced by  the bite of an animal of about the size of a wild boar. The stump of the  forearm is covered with irregular scars, such as would remain if the  hand had become gangrenous and fallen away. It was useless asking him  questions, as he had already told two distinct stories which have been  related above.    On August 10th, we leave Coquilhatville and steam down the river to  Irebu, which we reach after a few hours hot journey. Mr. Jeniaux, the  Commandant, has spared no pains to make the camp not only beautiful but  attractive in every way and it has well earned its reputation as one of  the show places of the Congo. Lord Mountmorres is lodged in a spare  house used for guests and Lieutenant Hoyer kindly lends me his during  our stay. The Mess is very comfortably arranged, and the dinner based on  antelope and wild pig is excellent.    Next day I go hunting with Mr. Hoyer in a canoe propelled by twenty  paddlers. These at first keep up a kind of chant to the time of the  paddles which is quite musical and pleasant. As we approach the game  grounds however, they become quite silent. After travelling up stream  for about a mile, we land in a kind of bog which is full of a species of  duck, somewhat resembling a wood-cock. A sergeant of the Force Publique  acts as guide and hunter, and it soon becomes apparent that the native  is in the habit of stalking even birds and shooting them sitting. This  is natural enough for formerly they were armed with bows and arrows, and  now the army of course use only rifles. Shot guns, therefore, are only  known to the boys of the white men, some of whom are very good shots.  The hunter seems quite annoyed because I only shoot at birds on the  wing, but is delighted when one falls. So far indeed, the only  enthusiasm a native has shown, has been while hunting after a successful  shot. The paddlers at once re-enact the scene, put imaginary guns to  their shoulders give a loud bang and then describe circles with their  hands to give a dumb show of the bird falling, laughing and shouting  all the time. They are really just like young children and are easily  pleased by trifles. After walking some distance the sergeant becomes  wildly excited and clutches me violently by the arm but makes no noise.  Looking up I see a large monkey but signify that I will not shoot those  beasts. He then asks permission to fire his rifle and brings it down  with a shot through the head. After this we paddle on to the hippo  ground. After the very first shot at a head fifty yards away, the canoe  suddenly gives a great lurch and as nearly as possible capsizes. Another  great beast had evidently chosen that moment to come up just under it  and if we had not been a heavy load, would undoubtedly have thrown it  high in the air. As it was, beyond a shaking, no one was damaged and we  had excellent sport for a few minutes until the animals made for the  bank and hid themselves in the long grass.    Behind Irebu is a plain, where the grass is really green, the green that  is only seen in the tropics. Here and there are clumps of palms and  patches of forest, the whole giving the appearance of a well kept park.  There are antelope and wild pig here but they are very difficult to  stalk owing to the open character of the ground. There are also a few  red-legged partridges and many pigeons so that one always found  something to shoot.    The native camp here consists of a large square shut off by a wooden  fence. Inside are large huts in which the soldiers live, and oddly  enough, they all prefer to have separate establishments, each woman  preparing the food for her husband. These women also work in the  plantation when they are not concerned with the business of maternity,  which judging by the number of children about, must be very seldom. The  native cemetery is a curious-looking place, for on each grave is placed  the clothes of the dead one and any other belongings he has. No one  knows the origin or object of this custom. They are not for the journey  to the happy hunting ground apparently, for missionaries say they have  never heard the natives speak of any kind of a future state. It may be  that these articles are merely to show the wealth of the departed; they  are however, all broken or torn to shreds, so that no robber should be  tempted to take them. Many of the tribes are said to eat their dead,  except those of high position and those who die of infectious diseases,  and others used to throw the corpses in the river. Some tribes however,  have a very elaborate funeral with much wailing and lamenting and the  departed is interred beneath his own hut, which is never occupied again.    At Irebu, the narrow river from Lake Tumba joins the Congo, and from its  small size is known usually as the canal. The current sometimes flows up  and sometimes down, according to the height of water in the Congo, but  it is obvious that the general direction must be down, as many small  streams flow into the Lake, and all their water is certainly not  dispersed by evaporation. Many crocodiles pass up and down the canal and  it would be easy to shoot them from the windows or verandah of my house,  but it seems to be rather a waste of cartridges which, like most other  things, must be carried the whole tour, for none can be procured in the  Congo. I do not therefore, care to run the risk of running short when  the hunting grounds of Uele are reached.    Sunday is usually a very busy day in Irebu. No work is done, but all "]]]
