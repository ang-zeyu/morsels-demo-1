The old British pioneer may have  whelped a few million good fighting stock in his time, but this class of  animal is no lion's whelp; it is a thing all mouth and no manners, a  shallow-brained, cowardly creature, always howling about the Boer, but too  discreet to go out and fight him, though ready at all times to malign him,  to ridicule him as a farmer or a fighter, and it is a perfect bear's feast  to this hybrid animal to get hold of a gullible newspaper correspondent to  tell him gruesome tales relative to Boer fighting laagers.    I had one of this peculiar species at me the other day in Burghersdorp, and  he painted a Boer laager so vividly, between nips at my flask, that if I  had not seen a few laagers myself I should have felt bad over the matter.  He pictured the smell of that laager in language so intense, with gestures  so graphic, that some of his auditors had to hold their nostrils with  handkerchiefs, whilst they stirred the circumambient atmosphere with  cardboard fans, and I could not help wondering, if the portrait of the  smell was so awful, what the thing itself must be like. Flushed with  success, the narrator pursued his subject to the bitter extremity. He  conjured up scenes of half-buried men lying amongst the rocks surrounding  the laager: here a leg, there an arm, further on a ghastly human head  protruding from amidst the scattered boulders, until I had only to close my  eyes to fancy I was in a charnel-house, where Goths and Huns were holding  devilish revelry. The B.R. paused, and dropped his voice two octaves lower,  and the crowd on the balcony craned their heads further forward, so that  they might not miss a single word. He told of the women in the laagers, the  wild, unholy mirth of women, who moved from camp fire to camp fire, with  dishevelled hair streaming down their backs, with tossing arms, bare to the  shoulders, and blood besmeared, not the blood of goats or kine, but the  blood of soldiers--our soldiers. Thomas Atkins defunct, and done for by the  she-furies.    He waded in again when the shudder which shook the crowd had died away, and  hinted, as that class of shallow-souled creature loves to hint, of orgies  under the dim light of the stars, or between the flickering light of  smoking camp fires, until the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah seemed to be  crowding all around us in a peculiarly beastly and uncomfortable fashion.  Then he lay back in his chair and sighed; but anon he sprang upright, and,  with flashing eyes and extended arms, wanted to know what the ---- Roberts  meant by offering peace with honour to such a people. \"Mow them down!\" he  yelled. \"Shoot them on sight--no quarter for such devils! Kill 'em off!  kill 'em off! kill 'em off!\" and he half sobbed, half sighed himself into  silence, whilst the audience gazed on him as on one who knew what war,  wild, red, carmine war, was. I broke in on his stillness, as newspaper men  who know the game are apt to do, for I wanted data, I wanted facts, and I  had not swallowed his yarn as freely as he had swallowed my whisky.    \"Born in this country?\" I asked.    \"Yorkshire,\" he answered laconically.    \"Been in Africa long?\"    \"'Bout five years.\"    \"Where did you put in most of your time before  the war?\"    \"Johannesburg.\"    \"Mines?\"    \"No.\"    \"Merchant?\"    \"No.\"    \"Hotel-keeper, perhaps?\"    \"No.\"    \"Shopkeeper?\"    \"No.\"    \"What was your calling, or profession, or business, or means of  livelihood?\"    \"General agent, sharebroker, correspondent for some local papers.\"    H'm; I knew the class of animal well--general jackal; do the dirty work of  any trade, and master of none.    \"Where were you when the war broke out?\"    He scowled savagely: \"Johannesburg.\"    \"Have the same hatred for the Boers before the war as you have now?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Why didn't you pick up a rifle and have a hand in the fighting?\"    \"I'm not a blessed 'Tommy,' sir! Do you take me for a d---- 'Tommy,' sir?\"    \"No; oh, no, I assure you I did nothing of the kind. But--er, have you been  in the hands of the Boers since the war started?\"    \"Yes, until our troops marched in here a day or two ago.\"    \"H'm. Did they rob you?\"    \"No.\"    \"Did they ill-treat you--knock you about, and that sort of thing?\"    \"No.\"    \"Why do you hate them so bitterly, then?\"    \"Oh, I can't stand a cursed Boer at any price. Thinks he's as good as a  Britisher all the time, and puts on side; and he's a cursed tyrant in his  heart, and would rub us out if he could.\"    \"Yes, the Boer thought himself as good a man as the Britishers he met out  this way,\" I replied, \"and he backed his opinion with his life and his  rifle. Why didn't you do the same if you reckoned yourself a better man?\"    \"Why should I; don't we pay 'Tommy' to do that for us?\"    \"Perhaps we do; but, concerning those Boer laagers you have been telling us  about: where, when, and how did you see them; what was the name of the  place; who was the Boer general in command, or the field cornet, or  landdrost? I did not know the Boers gave British refugees the free run of  their war laagers, and I'm interested in the matter, being a scribe myself  and a man of peace. Just give me a few names and dates and facts, will  you?\"    \"No, I won't,\" he snarled. \"You seem to doubt my word, you do, and I'm as  good a Britisher as you are any day, and you think you can come along and  pump information out of me for nothing; but I'm too fly for that--they  don't breed fools in Yorkshire.\"    \"Well, sir, as it seems to suit your temper,\" I said as sweetly as I could,  \"I'll make it a business proposition. I'll bet you fifty pounds to five you  have never put your head inside a Boer laager in war time in your life. If  you have, just name it and give me a few facts.\"    The B.R. rose wrathfully and muttered something about it being a d---- good  job for me that I was a wounded man and had one arm in a sling, or he'd  show me a heap of things in the fistic line which I should remember for the  rest of my life; but as I only laughed he slouched off, and now, when we  meet in the street, we pass without speaking. But I got his history, all  the same, from one of the Cape Police, who told me the beggar had refused  to join a volunteer regiment when the war broke out, and had remained the  whole time in a quiet little Boer village as a British refugee, and had not  seen the outside, let alone the inside, of a Boer fighting laager in all  his lying life. Yet such cravens at times help to make history--of a kind.    Possibly it may interest Englishmen--and women, too, for that matter--to  know what a fighting laager is like, and as I have seen half a dozen of  them from the enemies' side of the wall, a rough pen and ink sketch may not  be amiss. In war time the Boer never, under any circumstances, makes his  laager in the open country if there are any kopjes about. No matter how  secure he may fancy himself from attack, no matter if there is not a foe  within fifty miles of him, the Boer commander always pitches his laager in  a place of safety between two parallel lines of hills, so that no attack  can be made upon him, either front or rear, without giving him an immense  advantage over the attacking force, even if the enemy is ten times as  strong in numbers. By this means the Boers make their laagers almost  impregnable. If they have a choice of ground, they pick a narrow ravine, or  gully, with a line of hills front and rear, covered with small rocky  boulders and bushes. They drive their waggons along the ravine, and make a  sort of rude breastwork across the gully with the waggons. In between these  waggons the women are placed for safety, for it is a noticeable fact that  very large numbers of women have followed their husbands and fathers to the  war, not to act as viragoes, not to play the wanton, not to unsex  themselves, not to handle the rifle, but to nurse the wounded, to comfort  the dying, and to lay out the dead. I have heard them singing round the  camp fires in the starlight, but it was hymns that they sang, not ribald  songs. I have seen them kneeling by the side of men in the moonlight, not  in wantonness, but in mercy, and many a man who wears the British uniform  to-day can bear me witness that I speak the truth.    The Boer never, if he can help it, allows himself to be separated from his  horse; and these hardy little animals, mostly about fifteen hands high, and  very lightly framed, are picketed close to the spot where the rider  deposits his rifle and blankets. If they allow them to graze on the  hillsides during the day, they run a rope through the halter near the  horse's muzzle, and tie it close above the knee-joint of the near fore-leg.  By this means the horse can graze in comfort, but cannot move away at any  pace beyond a slow walk, and so are easily caught and saddled if required  in a hurry. The oxen and sheep to be used for slaughtering purposes are  driven up close to the camp; a waggon or two is drawn across the ravine  above and below them, and they cannot then stampede if frightened by  anything, unless they climb the rocky heights on either side of them, which  they have small chance of doing, as the Kaffir herdsmen sleep on the hills  above them. Having pitched his laager, the commander sends out his scouts;  some amble off on horseback at a pace they call a \"tripple\"--a gait which  all the Boers educate their nags to adopt. It is not exactly an amble, but  a cousin to it, marvellously easy to the rider, whilst it enables the nag  to get over a wonderful lot of ground without knocking up. It also allows  the horse to pick his way amongst rocky ground, and so save his legs, where  an English, Indian, or Australian horse would be apt to cripple himself in  very short order.

For she dares not go to sleep  even for a single moment, knowing that the Blindworm is ever ready to  pounce upon her and take away the eyes which she is now enjoying.          MRS. PARTRIDGE'S BABIES      Long, long ago, when the world was very young indeed, the Birds and  Animals used to send their children to school, to Mother Magpie's  kindergarten. All the morning long the babies learned their lessons  which it was needful for them to know. And when the noon hour came their  various mammas came to the school bringing lunches for the children. You  can imagine how gladly they were received by the hungry little scholars.    One day Mrs. Partridge was very busy with her house-cleaning, and when  the noontime came she could not leave her work to go to the school with  her babies' lunch.    \"Dear me,\" she said, looking out of the nest, \"here it is noon and the  little Partridges will be so very hungry. But I really cannot leave home  now. What shall I do? If only some other mamma were going that way.\"    She craned her neck and looked eagerly in every direction. And finally  she spied Madame Tortoise plodding along towards the school, with the  lunch for her little Turtlets.    \"Oho, neighbor, oho! Stop a minute!\" cried Mrs. Partridge, waving a wing  at Tortoise. \"Are you going schoolward, as I think? Oh, dear Madame  Tortoise, if you knew how busy I am to-day. I don't think any one was  ever so busy as I am with my house-cleaning. Will you do me a favor,  please?\"    The Tortoise sniffed. \"Well, I am a busy woman myself,\" she said, \"but I  am willing to oblige a neighbor. What is it you wish, ma'am?\"    \"Oh, thank you so much!\" cried the Partridge. \"Dear Madame Tortoise, I  shall never forget your kindness. Now, will you take this bunch of nice  wiggly worms to my little ones for their lunch? I shall be so very  grateful.\"    \"Don't mention it,\" snapped the Tortoise, who was rather tired of  hearing Mrs. Partridge's shrill thanks. \"I'm perfectly willing to take  the lunch, since I am going to the same place. But I don't know your  babies. What do they look like, ma'am?\"    \"Oh, that is easily told,\" cried Mrs. Partridge. \"They are the most  beautiful little creatures in the school. They are said greatly to  resemble me. You will have no trouble in recognizing them. When you  come to the school just look around at all the children, and pick out  the three most beautiful of all. Those are certain to be mine. Give them  the wiggly worms, please, with my love. And oh, _thank_ you, Madame  Tortoise, so very much! Some time I will do as much for you. So  neighborly! Thank you!\"    [Illustration: _Here are some nice fat wiggly worms!_]    \"Don't mention it!\" snapped the Tortoise again, very much bored by all  this chatter. She sniffed as she moved slowly along towards the school,  with the second lunch carried carefully on her broad shell-back. \"They  are nice fat worms,\" she said.    Now when the Tortoise came to the school it was high noon, and all the  children were waiting open-mouthed for their mammas and the lunches  which they expected. Such rows and rows of wide hungry mouths! Madame  Tortoise moved slowly up and down and round and round, eyeing the  various children who begged for the nice wiggly worms. \"H'm!\" she said  to herself, \"hungry children seem to look considerably alike, and none  of them are so wondrously beautiful when their mouths are wide open  greedily. I wonder which are Mrs. Partridge's children. She told me to  give this lunch to the handsomest babies here. Well, I will, and if I  make a mistake it will not be my fault. Hello! Here are my dear little  Turtlets! Bless the babies, how pretty they are! Why, I declare, I never  realized that they were so handsome. Certainly, they are the  best-looking children in the school. Then I must give them Mrs.  Partridge's luncheon, for so I promised. Yes, my little ones, here is  your lunch which I brought for you. And when you have finished that,  here is another, some nice, fat, wiggly worms which mother collected on  the way,--a prize for the handsomest children in the school.\"    So the little Turtlets fared wonderfully well that day; but the poor  little Partridges went hungry, and had dreadful headaches, and went home  peeping sadly to their silly mother. And Mrs. Partridge had no more  sense than to be angry with Madame Tortoise, which I think was very  unfair, don't you? For the latter had only done as she was bidden by her  silly and conceited neighbor.    But after that the Tortoise and the Partridge never spoke to each other,  and their children would not play together at school.          THE EARLY GIRL      There were once two girls who were very dear friends, Zaica and  Tourtourelle. One morning Zaica woke up and said, \"O Tourtourelle! Last  night I had such a strange dream!\"    \"And so did I!\" cried Tourtourelle. \"Let us tell each other the dreams.  But you first, Zaica.\"    Zaica began to laugh. \"I dreamed I was a pretty bird with a tuft of  feathers on my head. I could fly, and, O Tourtourelle! it was great fun!  But the most amusing thing of all was that I could sing so finely, and  mock all the birds of the forest. Nay, I could even imitate the sounds  of animals. I cannot help laughing when I think what a jolly time I  had.\"    \"Why, Zaica!\" cried Tourtourelle, wondering, \"I dreamed the very same  thing. I too was a pretty little bird, and I too could imitate all kinds  of sounds as I fluttered in the tree-tops. Surely, the dream will come  true for one of us. How fine that would be!\"    \"Yes, let it be for the one of us who first rises to-morrow morning,\"  said Zaica. And so the two friends agreed.    Now when it came night-time Zaica went to bed very early, like a wise  little girl who wants to rise with the sun. But Tourtourelle said to  herself, \"I know what I will do, I will not go to sleep. I will sit up  all night, and then I am sure to be the first to rise.\"    So Tourtourelle perched herself on a high-backed chair and stretched her  eyes wide open. For hours and hours she sat there, growing more sleepy  every minute. Towards morning she began to nod; she could hardly keep  her eyes open, though she tried to prop the lids with her finger tips.  Finally, whether she would or no, she fell fast asleep, poor little  Tourtourelle, worn out with her long vigil.    When the first morning sunbeam peeped into the chamber Zaica opened her  eyes, refreshed and smiling. She sat up in bed remembering the dream,  and then jumped lightly to the floor. As she did so she glanced at her  feet, which felt queer. Wonderful! They were little bird claws! She  looked down at herself. She was covered with soft feathers. She tried to  move her arms, and when she did so she rose lightly from the floor and  skimmed out of the window into the garden. Zaica had become a pretty  little bird, just as she had dreamed. Oh, how happy she was! She heard a  Lark singing far up in the sky. Opening her mouth, she warbled and  trilled as well as he, until he dropped down quickly to the earth,  thinking it must be his mate who sang so sweetly. She spied a Chicken  strayed too far from the mother Hen; and chuckling to herself  mischievously she imitated the warning cry of a Hawk, till the Chick ran  squawking back to the shelter of his mother's wing. She heard a hound  baying afar off, and with little trouble echoed the sound so perfectly  that a groom came running out of the stable, whistling for the dog which  he feared was straying from the kennel. Zaica found that as in her dream  she could imitate all the sounds which she heard; and she was so pleased  that she sang and sang and sang, hopping from tree to tree, teasing the  other birds with her mockery, and puzzling them, too.    As for poor Tourtourelle, when she waked it was very late. She yawned  and rubbed her eyes languidly, for she was still sleepy. Then looking  across to Zaica's bed she saw that it was empty. Her heart gave a great  thump, for she longed and longed to be a bird, but now she feared that  she was too late. In her white gown she ran out into the garden looking  for Zaica. But first she saw an old man leading his cow to the pasture.  And to the cow he said, \"Coo-roo, coo-roo!\" coaxing her to hasten.    \"Coo-roo, coo-roo!\" cried Tourtourelle, imitating him, she knew not why.  And as she said it she wondered at the strange feeling which came over  her. For her body felt very light and it seemed as if she could fly. She  looked down and saw that she was no longer covered with a little white  gown but with soft feathers of ashy gray, while wings sprouted from her  shoulders.    \"Oh, I have become a bird!\" she tried to say, but all she uttered  was--\"Coo-roo, coo-roo!\" For Tourtourelle was become a beautiful  Turtle-Dove, and that is all a Turtle-Dove can say.    \"Coo-roo, coo-roo!\" mocked a voice from the tree. And cocking her little  reddish eye Tourtourelle saw a brilliant Jay hopping in the branches,  imitating a Dove. Then it was the song of a Wren that she heard, then a  Lark, then a Thrush, then a Sparrow-Hawk,--all these sounds coming from  the one little throat of the happy bird on that bough. Tourtourelle  tried to do likewise, but all she could sing was \"Coo-roo! coo-roo!\" And  she said mournfully to herself:--    \"It is Zaica. She was wiser than I, and earlier, and the dream came  true for her. Oh dear! Oh dear!\" And to this day Turtle-Dove flies about  sadly uttering her monotonous cry, and listening with a longing that  would be envy, were she not so good a little bird, to the chatter of her  friend the Jay.    For Zaica the Jay is always merry, hopping from tree to tree, playing  her jokes upon the other birds whom she deceives with her wonderful  voice. And she leads a life so gay and exciting that she never finds  time to be sad, even over the disappointment of her dear friend, poor  little Tourtourelle.
