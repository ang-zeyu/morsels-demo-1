Going a little further he came upon a  sort of window barred with iron, and looking within beheld a vast number  of miserable captives.    \"Alas! Alack!\" they cried on seeing him. \"Art come, young man, to join  us in this dreadful prison?\"    \"That depends,\" quoth Jack: \"but first tell me wherefore you are thus  held imprisoned?\"    \"Through no fault,\" they cried at once. \"We are captives of the cruel  giants and are kept here and well nourished until such time as the  monsters desire a feast. Then they choose the fattest and sup off them.\"    On hearing this Jack straightway unlocked the door of the prison and set  the poor fellows free. Then, searching the giants' coffers, he divided  the gold and silver equally amongst the captives as some redress for  their sufferings, and taking them to a neighbouring castle gave them a  right good feast.      VI    Now as they were all making merry over their deliverance, and praising  Jack's prowess, a messenger arrived to say that one Thunderdell, a huge  giant with two heads, having heard of the death of his kinsman, was on  his way from the northern dales to be revenged, and was already within a  mile or two of the castle, the country folk with their flocks and herds  flying before him like chaff before the wind.    [Illustration: On his way ... to be revenged]    Now the castle with its gardens stood on a small island that was  surrounded by a moat twenty feet wide and thirty feet deep, having very  steep sides. And this moat was spanned by a drawbridge. This, without a  moment's delay, Jack ordered should be sawn on both sides at the middle,  so as to only leave one plank uncut over which he in his invisible coat  of darkness passed swiftly to meet his enemy, bearing in his hand the  wonderful sword of strength.    Now though the giant could not, of course, see Jack, he could smell him,  for giants have keen noses. Therefore Thunderdell cried out in a voice  like his name:      \"Fee, fi, fo, fum!     I smell the blood of an Englishman.     Be he alive, or be he dead,     I'll grind his bones to make my bread!\"    [Illustration: The country folk flying before him like chaff before the  wind]    \"Is that so?\" quoth Jack, cheerful as ever. \"Then art thou a monstrous  miller for sure!\"    On this the giant, peering round everywhere for a glimpse of his foe,  shouted out:    \"Art thou, indeed, the villain who hath killed so many of my kinsmen?  Then, indeed, will I tear thee to pieces with my teeth, suck thy blood,  and grind thy bones to powder.\"    \"Thou'lt have to catch me first,\" quoth Jack, laughing, and throwing off  his coat of darkness and putting on his slippers of swiftness, he began  nimbly to lead the giant a pretty dance, he leaping and doubling light  as a feather, the monster following heavily like a walking tower, so  that the very foundations of the earth seemed to shake at every step.  At this game the onlookers nearly split their sides with laughter, until  Jack, judging there had been enough of it, made for the drawbridge, ran  neatly over the single plank, and reaching the other side waited in  teasing fashion for his adversary.    On came the giant at full speed, foaming at the mouth with rage, and  flourishing his club. But when he came to the middle of the bridge his  great weight, of course, broke the plank, and there he was fallen  headlong into the moat, rolling and wallowing like a whale, plunging  from place to place, yet unable to get out and be revenged.    The spectators greeted his efforts with roars of laughter, and Jack  himself was at first too overcome with merriment to do more than scoff.  At last, however, he went for a rope, cast it over the giant's two  heads, so, with the help of a team of horses, drew them shorewards,  where two blows from the sword of strength settled the matter.      VII    After some time spent in mirth and pastimes, Jack began once more to  grow restless, and taking leave of his companions set out for fresh  adventures.    He travelled far and fast, through woods, and vales, and hills, till at  last he came, late at night, on a lonesome house set at the foot of a  high mountain. Knocking at the door, it was opened by an old man whose  head was white as snow.    \"Father,\" said Jack, ever courteous, \"can you lodge a benighted  traveller?\"    \"Ay, that will I, and welcome to my poor cottage,\" replied the old man.    Whereupon Jack came in, and after supper they sate together chatting in  friendly fashion. Then it was that the old man, seeing by Jack's belt  that he was the famous Giant-Killer, spoke in this wise:    \"My son! You are the great conqueror of evil monsters. Now close by  there lives one well worthy of your prowess. On the top of yonder high  hill is an enchanted castle kept by a giant named Galligantua, who, by  the help of a wicked old magician, inveigles many beautiful ladies and  valiant knights into the castle, where they are transformed into all  sorts of birds and beasts, yea, even into fishes and insects. There they  live pitiably in confinement; but most of all do I grieve for a duke's  daughter whom they kidnapped in her father's garden, bringing her hither  in a burning chariot drawn by fiery dragons. Her form is that of a white  hind; and though many valiant knights have tried their utmost to break  the spell and work her deliverance, none have succeeded; for, see you,  at the entrance to the castle are two dreadful griffins who destroy  every one who attempts to pass them by.\"    Now Jack bethought him of the coat of darkness which had served him so  well before, and he put on the cap of knowledge, and in an instant he  knew what had to be done. Then the very next morning, at dawn-time, Jack  arose and put on his invisible coat and his slippers of swiftness. And  in the twinkling of an eye there he was on the top of the mountain! And  there were the two griffins guarding the castle gates--horrible  creatures with forked tails and tongues. But they could not see him  because of the coat of darkness, so he passed them by unharmed.    And hung to the doors of the gateway he found a golden trumpet on a  silver chain, and beneath it was engraved in red lettering:      Whoever shall this trumpet blow    Will cause the giant's overthrow.    The black enchantment he will break,    And gladness out of sadness make.    No sooner had Jack read these words than he put the horn to his lips and  blew a loud                    \"Tantivy! Tantivy! Tantivy!\"    Now at the very first note the castle trembled to its vast foundations,  and before he had finished the measure, both the giant and the magician  were biting their thumbs and tearing their hair, knowing that their  wickedness must now come to an end. But the giant showed fight and took  up his club to defend himself; whereupon Jack, with one clean cut of the  sword of strength, severed his head from his body, and would doubtless  have done the same to the magician, but that the latter was a coward,  and, calling up a whirlwind, was swept away by it into the air, nor  has he ever been seen or heard of since. The enchantments being thus  broken, all the valiant knights and beautiful ladies, who had been  transformed into birds and beasts and fishes and reptiles and insects,  returned to their proper shapes, including the duke's daughter, who,  from being a white hind, showed as the most beauteous maiden upon whom  the sun ever shone. Now, no sooner had this occurred than the whole  castle vanished away in a cloud of smoke, and from that moment giants  vanished also from the land.    [Illustration: The giant Galligantua and the wicked old magician  transform the duke's daughter into a white hind]    So Jack, when he had presented the head of Galligantua to King Arthur,  together with all the lords and ladies he had delivered from  enchantment, found he had nothing more to do. As a reward for past  services, however, King Arthur bestowed the hand of the duke's daughter  upon honest Jack the Giant-Killer. So married they were, and the whole  kingdom was filled with joy at their wedding. Furthermore, the King  bestowed on Jack a noble castle with a magnificent estate belonging  thereto, whereon he, his lady, and their children lived in great joy and  content for the rest of their days.          [Illustration: Headpiece--The Three Sillies]    THE THREE SILLIES      Once upon a time, when folk were not so wise as they are nowadays, there  lived a farmer and his wife who had one daughter. And she, being a  pretty lass, was courted by the young squire when he came home from his  travels.    Now every evening he would stroll over from the Hall to see her and stop  to supper in the farm-house, and every evening the daughter would go  down into the cellar to draw the cider for supper.    So one evening when she had gone down to draw the cider and had turned  the tap as usual, she happened to look up at the ceiling, and there she  saw a big wooden mallet stuck in one of the beams.    It must have been there for ages and ages, for it was all covered with  cobwebs; but somehow or another she had never noticed it before, and at  once she began thinking how dangerous it was to have the mallet just  there.    \"For,\" thought she, \"supposing him and me was married, and supposing we  was to have a son, and supposing he were to grow up to be a man, and  supposing he were to come down to draw cider like as I'm doing, and  supposing the mallet were to fall on his head and kill him, how dreadful  it would be!\"    And with that she put down the candle she was carrying and, seating  herself on a cask, began to cry. And she cried and cried and cried.    Now, upstairs, they began to wonder why she was so long drawing the  cider; so after a time her mother went down to the cellar to see what  had come to her, and found her, seated on the cask, crying ever so hard,  and the cider running all over the floor.    \"Lawks a mercy me!\" cried her mother, \"whatever"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17071"],[0,"Folk-Lore and Legends: Scotland (#13)"],[1,"power  of this hag, and when she bade him take leave of the sun, and of the leaf  that grew on the tree, he felt himself under the necessity of obeying  her.  A cavern received them, in which, following his frightful guide, he  for three days travelled in darkness, sometimes hearing the booming of a  distant ocean, sometimes walking through rivers of blood, which crossed  their subterranean path.  At length they emerged into daylight, in a most  beautiful orchard.  Thomas, almost fainting for want of food, stretched  out his hand towards the goodly fruit which hung around him, but was  forbidden by his conductress, who informed him that these were the fatal  apples which were the cause of the fall of man.  He perceived also that  his guide had no sooner entered this mysterious ground and breathed its  magic air than she was revived in beauty, equipage, and splendour, as  fair or fairer than he had first seen her on the mountain.  She then  proceeded to explain to him the character of the country.    \"Yonder right-hand path,\" she says, \"conveys the spirits of the blest to  paradise.  Yon downward and well-worn way leads sinful souls to the place  of everlasting punishment.  The third road, by yonder dark brake,  conducts to the milder place of pain, from which prayer and mass may  release offenders.  But see you yet a fourth road, sweeping along the  plain to yonder splendid castle?  Yonder is the road to Elfland, to which  we are now bound.  The lord of the castle is king of the country, and I  am his queen; and when we enter yonder castle, you must observe strict  silence, and answer no question that is asked you, and I will account for  your silence by saying I took your speech when I brought you from middle  earth.\"    Having thus instructed him, they journeyed on to the castle, and,  entering by the kitchen, found themselves in the midst of such a festive  scene as might become the mansion of a great feudal lord or prince.    Thirty carcasses of deer were lying on the massive kitchen board, under  the hands of numerous cooks, who toiled to cut them up and dress them,  while the gigantic greyhounds which had taken the spoil lay lapping the  blood, and enjoying the sight of the slain game.  They came next to the  royal hall, where the king received his loving consort; knights and  ladies, dancing by threes, occupied the floor of the hall; and Thomas,  the fatigue of his journey from the Eildon Hills forgotten, went forward  and joined in the revelry.  After a period, however, which seemed to him  a very short one, the queen spoke with him apart, and bade him prepare to  return to his own country.    \"Now,\" said the queen, \"how long think you that you have been here?\"    \"Certes, fair lady,\" answered Thomas, \"not above these seven days.\"    \"You are deceived,\" answered the queen; \"you have been seven years in  this castle, and it is full time you were gone.  Know, Thomas, that the  archfiend will come to this castle to-morrow to demand his tribute, and  so handsome a man as you will attract his eye.  For all the world would I  not suffer you to be betrayed to such a fate; therefore up, and let us be  going.\"    This terrible news reconciled Thomas to his departure from Elfinland; and  the queen was not long in placing him upon Huntly Bank, where the birds  were singing.  She took leave of him, and to ensure his reputation  bestowed on him the tongue which _could not lie_.  Thomas in vain  objected to this inconvenient and involuntary adhesion to veracity, which  would make him, as he thought, unfit for church or for market, for king's  court or for lady's bower.  But all his remonstrances were disregarded by  the lady; and Thomas the Rhymer, whenever the discourse turned on the  future, gained the credit of a prophet whether he would or not, for he  could say nothing but what was sure to come to pass.    Thomas remained several years in his own tower near Ercildoun, and  enjoyed the fame of his predictions, several of which are current among  the country people to this day.  At length, as the prophet was  entertaining the Earl of March in his dwelling, a cry of astonishment  arose in the village, on the appearance of a hart and hind, which left  the forest, and, contrary to their shy nature, came quietly onward,  traversing the village towards the dwelling of Thomas.  The prophet  instantly rose from the board, and acknowledging the prodigy as the  summons of his fate, he accompanied the hart and hind into the forest,  and though occasionally seen by individuals to whom he has chosen to show  himself, he has never again mixed familiarly with mankind.          FAIRY FRIENDS.      It is a good thing to befriend the fairies, as the following stories  show:--    There have been from time immemorial at Hawick, during the two or three  last weeks of the year, markets once a week, for the disposal of sheep  for slaughter, at which the greater number of people, both in the middle  and poorer classes of life, have been accustomed to provide themselves  with their _marts_.  A poor man from Jedburgh who was on his way to  Hawick for the purpose of attending one of these markets, as he was  passing over that side of Rubislaw which is nearest the Teviot, was  suddenly alarmed by a frightful and unaccountable noise.  The sound, as  he supposed, proceeded from an immense number of female voices, but no  objects whence it could come were visible.  Amidst howling and wailing  were mixed shouts of mirth and jollity, but he could gather nothing  articulate except the following words--    \"O there's a bairn born, but there's naething to pit on 't.\"    The occasion of this elfish concert, it seemed, was the birth of a fairy  child, at which the fairies, with the exception of two or three who were  discomposed at having nothing to cover the little innocent with, were  enjoying themselves with that joviality usually characteristic of such an  event.  The astonished rustic finding himself amongst a host of invisible  beings, in a wild moorland place, and far from any human assistance,  should assistance be required, full of the greatest consternation,  immediately on hearing this expression again and again vociferated,  stripped off his plaid, and threw it on the ground.  It was instantly  snatched up by an invisible hand, and the wailings immediately ceased,  but the shouts of mirth were continued with increased vigour.  Being of  opinion that what he had done had satisfied his invisible friends, he  lost no time in making off, and proceeded on his road to Hawick, musing  on his singular adventure.  He purchased a sheep, which turned out a  remarkably good bargain, and returned to Jedburgh.  He had no cause to  regret his generosity in bestowing his plaid on the fairies, for every  day afterwards his wealth multiplied, and he continued till the day of  his death a rich and prosperous man.    * * * * *    About the beginning of harvest, there having been a want of meal for  _shearers_' bread in the farmhouse of Bedrule, a small quantity of barley  (being all that was yet ripe) was cut down, and converted into meal.  Mrs.  Buckham, the farmer's wife, rose early in the morning to bake the bread,  and, while she was engaged in baking, a little woman in green costume  came in, and, with much politeness, asked for a loan of a capful of meal.  Mrs. Buckham thought it prudent to comply with her request.  In a short  time afterwards the woman in green returned with an equal quantity of  meal, which Mrs. Buckham put into the _meal-ark_.  This meal had such a  lasting quality, that from it alone the gudewife of Bedrule baked as much  bread as served her own family and the reapers throughout the harvest,  and when harvest was over it was not exhausted.          THE SEAL-CATCHER'S ADVENTURE.      There was once upon a time a man who lived upon the northern coasts, not  far from \"Taigh Jan Crot Callow\" (John-o'-Groat's House), and he gained  his livelihood by catching and killing fish, of all sizes and  denominations.  He had a particular liking for the killing of those  wonderful beasts, half dog half fish, called \"Roane,\" or seals, no doubt  because he got a long price for their skins, which are not less curious  than they are valuable.  The truth is, that the most of these animals are  neither dogs nor cods, but downright fairies, as this narration will  show; and, indeed, it is easy for any man to convince himself of the fact  by a simple examination of his _tobacco-spluichdan_, for the dead skins  of those beings are never the same for four-and-twenty hours together.  Sometimes the _spluichdan_ will erect its bristles almost  perpendicularly, while, at other times, it reclines them even down; one  time it resembles a bristly sow, at another time a _sleekit cat_; and  what dead skin, except itself, could perform such cantrips?  Now, it  happened one day, as this notable fisher had returned from the  prosecution of his calling, that he was called upon by a man who seemed a  great stranger, and who said he had been despatched for him by a person  who wished to contract for a quantity of seal-skins, and that the fisher  must accompany him (the stranger) immediately to see the person who  wished to contract for the skins, as it was necessary that he should be  served that evening.  Happy in the prospect of making a good bargain, and  never suspecting any duplicity, he instantly complied.  They both mounted  a steed belonging to the stranger, and took the road with such velocity  that, although the direction of the wind was towards their backs, yet the  fleetness of their movement made it appear as if it had been in their  faces.  On reaching a stupendous precipice which overhung the sea, his  guide told him they had now reached their destination.    \"Where is the person you spoke of!\" inquired the astonished seal-killer.    \"You shall see that presently,\" replied the guide.  With that they  immediately alighted, and, without allowing the"]]]
