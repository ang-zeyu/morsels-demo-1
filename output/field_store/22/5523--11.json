[Sensation.]    The necessary result was to establish the rule of violence--force,  instead of the rule of law and reason; to perpetuate and spread slavery,  and, in time, to make it general. We see it at both ends of the line. In  Washington, on the very spot where the outrage was started, the fearless  Sumner is beaten to insensibility, and is now slowly dying; while  senators who claim to be gentlemen and Christians stood by,  countenancing the act, and even applauding it afterward in their places  in the Senate. Even Douglas, our man, saw it all and was within helping  distance, yet let the murderous blows fall unopposed. Then, at the other  end of the line, at the very time Sumner was being murdered, Lawrence  was being destroyed for the crime of Freedom. It was the most prominent  stronghold of liberty in Kansas, and must give way to the all-dominating  power of slavery. Only two days ago, Judge Trumbull found it necessary  to propose a bill in the Senate to prevent a general civil war and to  restore peace in Kansas.    We live in the midst of alarms; anxiety beclouds the future; we expect  some new disaster with each newspaper we read. Are we in a healthful  political state? Are not the tendencies plain? Do not the signs of the  times point plainly the way in which we are going? [Sensation.]    In the early days of the Constitution slavery was recognized, by South  and North alike, as an evil, and the division of sentiment about it was  not controlled by geographical lines or considerations of climate, but  by moral and philanthropic views. Petitions for the abolition of slavery  were presented to the very first Congress by Virginia and Massachusetts  alike. To show the harmony which prevailed, I will state that a fugitive  slave law was passed in 1793, with no dissenting voice in the Senate,  and but seven dissenting votes in the House. It was, however, a wise  law, moderate, and, under the Constitution, a just one. Twenty-five  years later, a more stringent law was proposed and defeated; and  thirty-five years after that, the present law, drafted by Mason of  Virginia, was passed by Northern votes. I am not, just now, complaining  of this law, but I am trying to show how the current sets; for the  proposed law of 1817 was far less offensive than the present one. In  1774 the Continental Congress pledged itself, without a dissenting vote,  to wholly discontinue the slave trade, and to neither purchase nor  import any slave: and less than three months before the passage of the  Declaration of Independence, the same Congress which adopted that  declaration unanimously resolved \"that _no slave be imported into any of  the thirteen United Colonies_.\" [Great applause.]    On the second day of July, 1776, the draft of a Declaration of  Independence was reported to Congress by the committee, and in it the  slave trade was characterized as \"an execrable commerce,\" as \"a  piratical warfare,\" as the \"opprobrium of infidel powers,\" and as \"a  cruel war against human nature.\" [Applause.] All agreed on this except  South Carolina and Georgia, and in order to preserve harmony, and from  the necessity of the case, these expressions were omitted. Indeed,  abolition societies existed as far south as Virginia; and it is a  well-known fact that Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Lee, Henry, Mason,  and Pendleton were qualified abolitionists, and much more radical on  that subject than we of the Whig and Democratic parties claim to be  to-day. On March 1, 1784, Virginia ceded to the confederation all its  lands lying northwest of the Ohio River. Jefferson, Chase of Maryland,  and Howell of Rhode Island, as a committee on that and territory  thereafter _to be ceded_, reported that no slavery should exist after  the year 1800. Had this report been adopted, not only the Northwest, but  Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi also would have been free;  but it required the assent of nine States to ratify it. North Carolina  was divided, and thus its vote was lost; and Delaware, Georgia, and New  Jersey refused to vote. In point of fact, as it was, it was assented to  by six States. Three years later, on a square vote to exclude slavery  from the Northwest, only one vote, and that from New York, was against  it. And yet, thirty-seven years later, five thousand citizens of  Illinois out of a voting mass of less than twelve thousand,  deliberately, after a long and heated contest, voted to introduce  slavery in Illinois; and, to-day, a large party in the free State of  Illinois are willing to vote to fasten the shackles of slavery on the  fair domain of Kansas, notwithstanding it received the dowry of freedom  long before its birth as a political community. I repeat, therefore, the  question, Is it not plain in what direction we are tending? [Sensation.]  In the colonial time, Mason, Pendleton, and Jefferson were as hostile to  slavery in Virginia as Otis, Ames, and the Adamses were in  Massachusetts; and Virginia made as earnest an effort to get rid of it  as old Massachusetts did. But circumstances were against them and they  failed; but not that the good-will of its leading men was lacking. Yet  within less than fifty years Virginia changed its tune, and made  negro-breeding for the cotton and sugar States one of its leading  industries. [Laughter and applause.]    In the Constitutional Convention, George Mason of Virginia made a more  violent abolition speech than my friends Lovejoy or Codding would desire  to make here to-day--a speech which could not be safely repeated  anywhere on Southern soil in this enlightened year. But while there were  some differences of opinion on this subject even then, discussion was  allowed; but as you see by the Kansas slave code, which, as you know, is  the Missouri slave code, merely ferried across the river, it is a felony  to even express an opinion hostile to that foul blot in the land of  Washington and the Declaration of Independence. [Sensation.]    In Kentucky--my State--in 1849, on a test vote, the mighty influence of  Henry Clay and many other good men there could not get a symptom of  expression in favour of gradual emancipation on a plain issue of  marching toward the light of civilization with Ohio and Illinois; but  the State of Boone and Hardin and Henry Clay, with a _nigger_ under each  arm, took the black trail toward the deadly swamps of barbarism. Is  there--can there be--any doubt about this thing? And is there any doubt  that we must all lay aside our prejudices and march, shoulder to  shoulder, in the great army of Freedom? [Applause.]    Every Fourth of July our young orators all proclaim this to be \"the land  of the _free_ and the home of the brave!\" Well, now, when you orators  get that off next year, and, may be, this very year, how would you like  some old grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it? [Laughter.]  How would you like that? But suppose Kansas comes in as a slave State,  and all the \"border ruffians\" have barbecues about it, and free-State  men come trailing back to the dishonoured North, like whipped dogs with  their tails between their legs, it is--ain't it?--evident that this is  no more the \"land of the free;\" and if we let it go so, we won't dare to  say \"home of the brave\" out loud. [Sensation and confusion.]    Can any man doubt that, even in spite of the people's will, slavery will  triumph through violence, unless that will be made manifest and  enforced? Even Governor Reeder claimed at the outset that the contest in  Kansas was to be fair, but he got his eyes open at last; and I believe  that, as a result of this moral and physical violence, Kansas will soon  apply for admission as a slave State. And yet we can't mistake that the  people don't want it so, and that it is a land which is free both by  natural and political law. _No law is free law!_ Such is the  understanding of all Christendom. In the Somerset case, decided nearly a  century ago, the great Lord Mansfield held that slavery was of such a  nature that it must take its rise in _positive_ (as distinguished from  _natural_) law; and that in no country or age could it be traced back to  any other source. Will some one please tell me where is the _positive_  law that establishes slavery in Kansas? [A voice: \"The _bogus_ laws.\"]  Aye, the _bogus_ laws! And, on the same principle, a gang of Missouri  horse-thieves could come into Illinois and declare horse-stealing to be  legal [Laughter], and it would be just as legal as slavery is in Kansas.  But by express statute, in the land of Washington and Jefferson, we may  soon be brought face to face with the discreditable fact of showing to  the world by our acts that we prefer slavery to freedom--darkness to  light! [Sensation.]    It is, I believe, a principle in law that when one party to a contract  violates it so grossly as to chiefly destroy the object for which it is  made, the other party may rescind it. I will ask Browning if that ain't  good law. [Voices: \"Yes!\"] Well, now if that be right, I go for  rescinding the whole, entire Missouri Compromise and thus turning  Missouri into a free State; and I should like to know the  difference--should like for any one to point out the difference--between  _our_ making a free State of Missouri and _their_ making a slave State  of Kansas. [Great applause.] There ain't one bit of difference, except  that our way would be a great mercy to humanity. But I have never  said--and the Whig party has never said--and those who oppose the  Nebraska bill do not as a body say, that they have any intention of  interfering with slavery in the slave States. Our platform says just the  contrary. We allow slavery to exist in the slave States--not because  slavery is right or good, but from the necessities of our Union. We  grant a fugitive slave law because it is so \"nominated in the bond;\"  because our fathers so stipulated--had to--and we are bound to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14742"],[0,"Vanishing England (#13)"],[1,"whitewashed and have thatched roofs, except  when Horsham slates or tiles are used. Thatch as a roofing material  will soon have altogether vanished with other features of vanishing  England. District councils in their by-laws usually insert regulations  prohibiting thatch to be used for roofing. This is one of the  mysteries of the legislation of district councils. Rules, suitable  enough for towns, are applied to the country villages, where they are  altogether unsuitable or unnecessary. The danger of fire makes it  inadvisable to have thatched roofs in towns, or even in some villages  where the houses are close together, but that does not apply to  isolated cottages in the country. The district councils do not compel  the removal of thatch, but prohibit new cottages from being roofed  with that material. There is, however, another cause for the  disappearance of thatched roofs, which form such a beautiful feature  in the English landscape. Since mowing-machines came into general use  in the harvest fields the straw is so bruised that it is not fit for  thatching, at least it is not so suitable as the straw which was cut  by the hand. Thatching, too, is almost a lost art in the country.  Indeed ricks have to be covered with thatch, but \"the work for this  temporary purpose cannot compare with that of the old roof-thatcher,  with his 'strood' or 'frail' to hold the loose straw, and his  spars--split hazel rods pointed at each end--that with a dexterous  twist in the middle make neat pegs for the fastening of the straw rope  that he cleverly twists with a simple implement called a 'wimble.' The  lowest course was finished with an ornamental bordering of rods with a  diagonal criss-cross pattern between, all neatly pegged and held down  by the spars.\"[12]      [12] _Old West Surrey_, by Gertrude Jekyll, p. 206.    [Illustration: Missbrook Farm. Capel, Surrey.]    Horsham stone makes splendid roofing material. This stone easily  flakes into plates like thick slates, and forms large grey flat slabs  on which \"the weather works like a great artist in harmonies of moss  lichen and stain. No roofing so combines dignity and homeliness, and  no roofing, except possibly thatch (which, however, is short-lived),  so surely passes into the landscape.\"[13] It is to be regretted that  this stone is no longer used for roofing--another feature of vanishing  England. The stone is somewhat thick and heavy, and modern rafters are  not adapted to bear their weight. If you want to have a roof of  Horsham stone, you can only accomplish your purpose by pulling down an  old cottage and carrying off the slabs. Perhaps the small Cotswold  stone slabs are even more beautiful. Old Lancashire and Yorkshire  cottages have heavy stone roofs which somewhat resemble those  fashioned with Horsham slabs.      [13] _Highways and Byways in Sussex_, by E.V. Lucas.    The builders and masons of our country cottages were cunning men, and  adapted their designs to their materials. You will have noticed that  the pitch of the Horsham-slated roof is unusually flat. They observed  that when the sides of the roof were deeply sloping, as in the case of  thatched roofs, the heavy stone slates strained and dragged at the  pegs and laths and fell and injured the roof. Hence they determined  to make the slope less steep. Unfortunately the rain did not then  easily run off, and in order to prevent the water penetrating into the  house they were obliged to adopt additional precautions. Therefore  they cemented their roofs and stopped them with mortar.    [Illustration: Cottage at Capel, Surrey ]    Very lovely are these South Country cottages, peaceful, picturesque,  pleasant, with their graceful gables and jutting eaves, altogether  delightful. Well sang a loyal Sussex poet:--            If I ever become a rich man,            Or if ever I grow to be old,          I will build a house with deep thatch[14]            To shelter me from the cold;          And there shall the Sussex songs be sung            And the story of Sussex told.      [14] I fear the poet's plans will never be passed by the rural    district council.    We give some good examples of Surrey cottages at the village of Capel  in the neighbourhood of Dorking, a charming region for the study of  cottage-building. There you can see some charming ingle-nooks in the  interior of the dwellings, and some grand farm-houses. Attached to the  ingle-nook is the oven, wherein bread is baked in the old-fashioned  way, and the chimneys are large and carried up above the floor of the  first storey, so as to form space for curing bacon.    [Illustration: Farm-house, Horsmonden, Kent]    Horsmonden, Kent, near Lamberhurst, is beautifully situated among  well-wooded scenery, and the farm-house shown in the illustration is a  good example of the pleasant dwellings to be found therein.    East Anglia has no good building-stone, and brick and flint are the  principal materials used in that region. The houses built of the  dark, dull, thin old bricks, not of the great staring modern  varieties, are very charming, especially when they are seen against a  background of wooded hills. We give an illustration of some cottages  at Stow Langtoft, Suffolk.    [Illustration: Seventeenth-century Cottages, Stow Langtoft, Suffolk]    The old town of Banbury, celebrated for its cakes, its Cross, and its  fine lady who rode on a white horse accompanied by the sound of bells,  has some excellent \"black and white\" houses with pointed gables and  enriched barge-boards pierced in every variety of patterns, their  finials and pendants, and pargeted fronts, which give an air of  picturesqueness contrasting strangely with the stiffness of the  modern brick buildings. In one of these is established the old Banbury  Cake Shop. In the High Street there is a very perfect example of these  Elizabethan houses, erected about the year 1600. It has a fine oak  staircase, the newels beautifully carved and enriched with pierced  finials and pendants. The market-place has two good specimens of the  same date, one of which is probably the front of the Unicorn Inn, and  had a fine pair of wooden gates bearing the date 1684, but I am not  sure whether they are still there. The Reindeer Inn is one of the  chief architectural attractions of the town. We see the dates 1624 and  1637 inscribed on different parts of the building, but its chief glory  is the Globe Room, with a large window, rich plaster ceiling, good  panelling, elaborately decorated doorways and chimney-piece. The  courtyard is a fine specimen of sixteenth-century architecture. A  curious feature is the mounting-block near the large oriel window. It  must have been designed not for mounting horses, unless these were of  giant size, but for climbing to the top of coaches. The Globe Room is  a typical example of Vanishing England, as it is reported that the  whole building has been sold for transportation to America. We give an  illustration of some old houses in Paradise Square, that does not  belie its name. The houses all round the square are thatched, and the  gardens in the centre are a blaze of colour, full of old-fashioned  flowers. The King's Head Inn has a good courtyard. Banbury suffered  from a disastrous fire in 1628 which destroyed a great part of the  town, and called forth a vehement sermon from the Rev. William  Whateley, of two hours' duration, on the depravity of the town, which  merited such a severe judgment. In spite of the fire much old work  survived, and we give an illustration of a Tudor fire-place which you  cannot now discover, as it is walled up into the passage of an  ironmonger's shop.    [Illustration: The \"Fish House,\" Littleport, Cambs]    The old ports and harbours are always attractive. The old fishermen  mending their nets delight to tell their stories of their adventures,  and retain their old customs and usages, which are profoundly  interesting to the lovers of folk-lore. Their houses are often  primitive and quaint. There is the curious Fish House at Littleport,  Cambridgeshire, with part of it built of stone, having a gable and  Tudor weather-moulding over the windows. The rest of the building was  added at a later date.    [Illustration: Sixteenth-century Cottage, formerly standing in Upper  Deal, Kent]    In Upper Deal there is an interesting house which shows Flemish  influence in the construction of its picturesque gable and octagonal  chimney, and contrasted with it an early sixteenth-century cottage  much the worse for wear.    We give a sketch of a Portsmouth row which resembles in narrowness  those at Yarmouth, and in Crown Street there is a battered,  three-gabled, weather-boarded house which has evidently seen better  days. There is a fine canopy over the front door of Buckingham House,  wherein George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, was assassinated by John  Felton on August 23rd, 1628.    [Illustration: Gable, Upper Deal, Kent]    The Vale of Aylesbury is one of the sweetest and most charmingly  characteristic tracts of land in the whole of rural England,  abounding with old houses. The whole countryside literally teems with  picturesque evidences of the past life and history of England. Ancient  landmarks and associations are so numerous that it is difficult to  mention a few without seeming to ignore unfairly their equally  interesting neighbours. Let us take the London road, which enters the  shire from Middlesex and makes for Aylesbury, a meandering road with  patches of scenery strongly suggestive of Birket Foster's landscapes.  Down a turning at the foot of the lovely Chiltern Hills lies the  secluded village of Chalfont St. Giles. Here Milton, the poet, sought  refuge from plague-stricken London among a colony of fellow Quakers,  and here remains, in a very perfect state, the cottage in which he  lived and was visited by Andrew Marvel. It is said that his neighbour  Elwood, one of the Quaker fraternity, suggested the idea"]]]
