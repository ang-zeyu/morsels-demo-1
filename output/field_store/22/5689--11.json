To this assortment of disobliging  creatures let us add two horrors: the silky Epeirus, whose disc-shaped  scalloped abdomen is as big as a shilling, and the crowned Epeirus,  which is horribly hairy and corpulent.    I cannot doubt that the Mantis attacks such adversaries in a state of  nature when I see it, under my wire-gauze covers, boldly give battle to  whatever is placed before it. Lying in wait among the bushes it must  profit by the prizes bestowed upon it by hazard, as in its cage it  profits by the wealth of diet due to my generosity. The hunting of such  big game as I offer, which is full of danger, must form part of the  creature's usual life, though it may be only an occasional pastime,  perhaps to the great regret of the Mantis.    Crickets of all kinds, butterflies, bees, large flies of many species,  and other insects of moderate size: such is the prey that we habitually  find in the embrace of the murderous arms of the Mantis. But in my cages  I have never known the audacious huntress to recoil before any other  insect. Grey cricket, Decticus, Epeirus or Truxalis, sooner or later all  are harpooned, held motionless between the saw-edges of the arms, and  deliciously crunched at leisure. The process deserves a detailed  description.    At the sight of a great cricket, which thoughtlessly approaches along  the wire-work of the cover, the Mantis, shaken by a convulsive start,  suddenly assumes a most terrifying posture. An electric shock would not  produce a more immediate result. The transition is so sudden, the  mimicry so threatening, that the unaccustomed observer will draw back  his hand, as though at some unknown danger. Seasoned as I am, I myself  must confess to being startled on occasions when my thoughts have been  elsewhere. The creature spreads out like a fan actuated by a spring, or  a fantastic Jack-in-the-box.    The wing-covers open, and are thrust obliquely aside; the wings spring  to their full width, standing up like parallel screens of transparent  gauze, forming a pyramidal prominence which dominates the back; the end  of the abdomen curls upwards crosier-wise, then falls and unbends itself  with a sort of swishing noise, a _pouf! pouf!_ like the sound emitted by  the feathers of a strutting turkey-cock. One is reminded of the puffing  of a startled adder.    Proudly straddling on its four hind-claws, the insect holds its long  body almost vertical. The murderous fore-limbs, at first folded and  pressed against one another on the thorax, open to their full extent,  forming a cross with the body, and exhibiting the axillae ornamented with  rows of pearls, and a black spot with a central point of white. These  two eyes, faintly recalling those of the peacock's tail, and the fine  ebony embossments, are part of the blazonry of conflict, concealed upon  ordinary occasions. Their jewels are only assumed when they make  themselves terrible and superb for battle.    Motionless in its weird position, the Mantis surveys the acridian, its  gaze fixed upon it, its head turning gently as on a pivot as the other  changes place. The object of this mimicry seems evident; the Mantis  wishes to terrorise its powerful prey, to paralyse it with fright; for  if not demoralised by fear the quarry might prove too dangerous.    Does it really terrify its prey? Under the shining head of the Decticus,  behind the long face of the cricket, who is to say what is passing? No  sign of emotion can reveal itself upon these immovable masks. Yet it  seems certain that the threatened creature is aware of its danger. It  sees, springing up before it, a terrible spectral form with talons  outstretched, ready to fall upon it; it feels itself face to face with  death, and fails to flee while yet there is time. The creature that  excels in leaping, and might so easily escape from the threatening  claws, the wonderful jumper with the prodigious thighs, remains  crouching stupidly in its place, or even approaches the enemy with  deliberate steps.[2]    It is said that young birds, paralysed with terror by the gaping mouth  of a serpent, or fascinated by its gaze, will allow themselves to be  snatched from the nest, incapable of movement. The cricket will often  behave in almost the same way. Once within reach of the enchantress, the  grappling-hooks are thrown, the fangs strike, the double saws close  together and hold the victim in a vice. Vainly the captive struggles;  his mandibles chew the air, his desperate kicks meet with no resistance.  He has met with his fate. The Mantis refolds her wings, the standard of  battle; she resumes her normal pose, and the meal commences.    In attacking the Truxalis and the Ephippigera, less dangerous game than  the grey cricket and the Decticus, the spectral pose is less imposing  and of shorter duration. It is often enough to throw forward the talons;  this is so in the case of the Epeirus, which is seized by the middle of  the body, without a thought of its venomous claws. With the smaller  crickets, which are the customary diet in my cages as at liberty, the  Mantis rarely employs her means of intimidation; she merely seizes the  heedless passer-by as she lies in wait.    When the insect to be captured may present some serious resistance, the  Mantis is thus equipped with a pose which terrifies or perplexes,  fascinates or absorbs the prey, while it enables her talons to strike  with greater certainty. Her gins close on a demoralised victim,  incapable of or unready for defence. She freezes the quarry with fear or  amazement by suddenly assuming the attitude of a spectre.    The wings play an important part in this fantastic pose. They are very  wide, green on the outer edge, but colourless and transparent elsewhere.  Numerous nervures, spreading out fan-wise, cross them in the direction  of their length. Others, transversal but finer, cut the first at right  angles, forming with them a multitude of meshes. In the spectral  attitude the wings are outspread and erected in two parallel planes  which are almost in contact, like the wings of butterflies in repose.  Between the two the end of the abdomen rapidly curls and uncurls. From  the rubbing of the belly against the network of nervures proceeds the  species of puffing sound which I have compared to the hissing of an  adder in a posture of defence. To imitate this curious sound it is  enough rapidly to stroke the upper face of an outstretched wing with the  tip of the finger-nail.    In a moment of hunger, after a fast of some days, the large grey  cricket, which is as large as the Mantis or larger, will be entirely  consumed with the exception of the wings, which are too dry. Two hours  are sufficient for the completion of this enormous meal. Such an orgy is  rare. I have witnessed it two or three times, always asking myself where  the gluttonous creature found room for so much food, and how it  contrived to reverse in its own favour the axiom that the content is  less than that which contains it. I can only admire the privileges of a  stomach in which matter is digested immediately upon entrance, dissolved  and made away with.    The usual diet of the Mantis under my wire cages consists of crickets of  different species and varying greatly in size. It is interesting to  watch the Mantis nibbling at its cricket, which it holds in the vice  formed by its murderous fore-limbs. In spite of the fine-pointed muzzle,  which hardly seems made for such ferocity, the entire insect disappears  excepting the wings, of which only the base, which is slightly fleshy,  is consumed. Legs, claws, horny integuments, all else is eaten.  Sometimes the great hinder thigh is seized by the knuckle, carried to  the mouth, tasted, and crunched with a little air of satisfaction. The  swollen thigh of the cricket might well be a choice \"cut\" for the  Mantis, as a leg of lamb is for us!    The attack on the victim begins at the back of the neck or base of the  head. While one of the murderous talons holds the quarry gripped by the  middle of the body, the other presses the head downwards, so that the  articulation between the back and the neck is stretched and opens  slightly. The snout of the Mantis gnaws and burrows into this undefended  spot with a certain persistence, and a large wound is opened in the  neck. At the lesion of the cephalic ganglions the struggles of the  cricket grow less, and the victim becomes a motionless corpse. Thence,  unrestricted in its movements, this beast of prey chooses its mouthfuls  at leisure.          CHAPTER VI    THE MANTIS.--COURTSHIP      The little we have seen of the customs of the Mantis does not square  very well with the popular name for the insect. From the term  _Prego-Dieu_ we should expect a peaceful placid creature, devoutly  self-absorbed; and we find a cannibal, a ferocious spectre, biting open  the heads of its captives after demoralising them with terror. But we  have yet to learn the worst. The customs of the Mantis in connection  with its own kin are more atrocious even than those of the spiders, who  bear an ill repute in this respect.    To reduce the number of cages on my big laboratory table, to give myself  a little more room, while still maintaining a respectable menagerie, I  installed several females under one cover. There was sufficient space in  the common lodging and room for the captives to move about, though for  that matter they are not fond of movement, being heavy in the abdomen.  Crouching motionless against the wire work of the cover, they will  digest their food or await a passing victim.
