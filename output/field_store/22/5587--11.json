If the altered  waypoint had been adopted as a better position why was it then thought  that it had to be discarded?      Correction of co-ordinates    It was not until 14th November 1979 that any question arose about the  McMurdo waypoint. On that day Captain Simpson had taken the second  November 1979 sightseeing flight to the Antarctic and something  persuaded him to raise the matter of the southern waypoint with Captain  Johnson, the Flight Manager Line Operations. There is a difference of  opinion as to precisely what was said by Captain Simpson to Captain  Johnson but according to the evidence of those in the navigation section  they thought that when they checked up-to-date records of the  co-ordinates at McMurdo Station against the original NV90 flight plan  what had been brought forward for notice was the small difference of 10  minutes of longitude to which reference has been made. They said this  represented the recent relocation of the tactical air navigation system  (the TACAN) at Williams Field. Accordingly Mr Brown of the navigation  section wrote into his worksheet a corrected position of 77 deg. 52.7' S  and 166 deg. 58' E and entered those figures into the system on 16th  November. But the amendment was not made in the live flight planning  system until the early hours of 28th November. According to the members  of the navigation section all this was done without knowledge that the  effect of introducing the amended figures would be to override \"164 deg.  48'\" and so alter the co-ordinate by 2 deg. 10' rather than 10'.    The Commissioner rejected the explanations he had heard to the effect  that Captain Simpson's information seemed to point to quite a minor  movement to the up-dated position of the TACAN. He stated that there  appeared to have been clear advice by Captain Simpson that the \"false\"  waypoint was 27 miles west of it. In addition he rejected the possible  explanation that the advice had been misinterpreted by Captain Johnson  to whom it had been given, and he adopted instead what in paragraph 245  he described as \"the second explanation\":         \"(b) The second explanation is that both Captain Johnston and the       Navigation Section knew quite well that the McMurdo waypoint lay 27       miles to the west of the TACAN and that since his track had not       officially been approved by the Civil Aviation Division it should       therefore be realigned with the TACAN and then someone forgot to       ensure that Captain Collins was told of the change. Such an       interpretation means that the evidence as to the alleged belief of       a displacement of only 2.1 miles is untrue.\"         Then in paragraph 255 (d) he said this:         \"If, as I have held, the Navigation Section knew the actual       position of the McMurdo waypoint as being 27 miles to the west of       the TACAN, then why did they not submit to Captain Johnson, or to       flight Operations Division, that the waypoint should remain where       it was? One view is that the Flight Operations Division expected,       in terms of Captain Johnson's letter to the Director of Civil       Aviation dated 17 October 1979, that the next edition of the Ross       Sea chart NZ-RNC4 would contain the official Air New Zealand flight       path to McMurdo, and that the safest course would be to put the       destination point back to the approximate location at which Civil       Aviation Division had thought it had always been.\"    That last suggestion was not put to any of the navigation witnesses at  the Inquiry. It implies that although those in the navigation section  believed the airline had been using a computer track to the west of Ross  Island for the past year because it was the better route they  nevertheless suddenly became uneasy lest knowledge of the matter would  now reach the Civil Aviation Division which had not given its official  blessing to the change. The idea apparently is that because the airline  might receive an official rebuke the officers in the section made their  own independent decision that the route must once again be directed back  over Mt. Erebus.    There was no evidence at all before the Royal Commission that the  approval of the Civil Aviation Division was needed for a change from the  direct Cape Hallett/McMurdo route. An affidavit in support of the  present application for review indicates that if the matter had been  raised at the Inquiry members of the navigation section would have  wished to present evidence from the Civil Aviation Division that \"a  change of route from the direct route to the McMurdo Sound route would  not have required CAD approval and therefore could have been lawfully  accomplished by the airline without reference to CAD\". That situation  may have been anticipated by the Commissioner himself for by reference  to the false waypoint and the earlier consequential movement of the  computer flight track down McMurdo Sound to the west he said that  although approval of the route by the Civil Aviation Division should  have been obtained it \"would have been automatic\" (paragraph 150).    In paragraph 255 (f) of the Report the explanation from all four members  of the navigation section is described in the following way:         \"In my opinion this explanation that the change in the waypoint was       thought to be minimal in terms of distance is a concocted story       designed to explain away the fundamental mistake, made by someone,       in failing to ensure that Captain Collins was notified that his       aircraft was now programmed to fly on a collision course with Mt.       Erebus.\"    That finding is one of those directly challenged in the present  proceedings.      Advice of the Change    A different matter was considered by the Commissioner in relation to the  change made in November 1979 to move the waypoint back to the TACAN at  Williams Field. As usual a signal was sent to the United States base at  McMurdo with advice that the aircraft was to fly to the Antarctic on  28th November and the flight plan for the journey. And in the list of  waypoints appears the word \"McMurdo\" in lieu of the geographical  co-ordinates which had appeared in the equivalent signal for the flight  three weeks earlier. The message had been prepared by Mr Brown, one of  the four officers in the navigation section.    The use of the word \"McMurdo\" was the subject of an idea put by the  Commissioner to Mr Hewitt, who was the second of the witnesses from the  navigation section. The Commissioner asked:         \"I know you have explained to me how that happened but someone may       suggest to me before the enquiry is over that the object was to       thats (sic) not to reveal there had been this long standing error       in the co-ordinates and that is why the word McMurdo was relayed to       them. I take you would not agree with that\"         Mr Hewitt said:         \"Certainly not sir.\"    The suggestion had not been raised earlier at the Inquiry and it was not  mentioned by anybody subsequently. In particular it was not put to Mr  Brown himself when the latter was called to give evidence three months  later. However the Commissioner expressed his view upon the matter in  the following way. In paragraph 255 (e) he said this--         \"In my opinion, the introduction of the word 'McMurdo' into the Air       Traffic Control flight plan for the fatal flight was deliberately       designed to conceal from the United States authorities that the       flight path had been changed, and probably because it was known       that the United States Air Traffic Control would lodge an objection       to the new flight path.\"    It will be observed that the last few words are qualified by \"probably\".  It appears that the Commissioner was told during a visit to Antarctica  that the United States authorities would not have approved a flight path  over Ross Island. But there was no evidence that Air New Zealand had  ever received an intimation from the United States authorities to that  effect or that the navigation section had reason to think they would so  object. The qualification seems to reflect that position. In the result,  when the findings in the two sub-paragraphs 255 (e) and (f) are put  together they reveal the theory that at one at the same time the  navigation section felt obliged to conceal from officials in Wellington  the use of a flight track down McMurdo Sound that was regarded  favourably by officials at McMurdo Station and from officials at McMurdo  Station a flight track over Ross Island that was regarded favourably by  officials in Wellington.      Whiteout    In relation to the cover-up allegations that have been made against the  executive officers some reference should be made to their knowledge or  otherwise of the freak meteorological condition known as \"the whiteout  phenomenon\". Did they know or suspect that such a condition must have  been an explanation for what happened and yet still be determined as the  Commissioner found, to promote pilot error as the cause of the crash?    It is something that can be mentioned quite briefly. The Royal  Commission Report has made it clear the phenomenon can result in a loss  of horizon definition and depth perception and is a great hazard for  those who fly in arctic or antarctic conditions. The Commissioner found  that at the critical time \"air crew had been deceived into believing  that the rising white terrain ahead was in fact quite flat and that it  extended on"]]]
