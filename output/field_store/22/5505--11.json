Large sums of  money often change hands at these meetings, as the native is a born  gambler, and understands this primitive method of racing better than the  more complicated systems of the regular course. Owing to this, and to  the competitors' efforts to cheat one another, not infrequently knives  are drawn during the heated discussion which follows the race.    The ponies are, for the most part, taken straight off the camp, though  in some cases they have been fed on maize and trained. They are ridden  either bareback or with the native \"recado,\" and catch-weights: as may  be gathered from the method, it is usually \"owners up.\"    Between these two extreme classes of racing in this country are the  English camp race-meetings, which are held by all the larger polo clubs  once or twice a year. Being of rare occurrence, and as some, if not all,  of the faces are open to members of other clubs, these are among the  chief social gatherings in camp life: in many cases there is a small  polo tournament attached, as it is the best opportunity for those who  come from a distance, and could not come twice. Therefore it usually  means a two or three days' holiday, and often a dance, or some  entertainment in the evenings. Old friends exchange reminiscences, and  new acquaintances are formed; while the ladies also make the best of the  opportunity to put on their smartest frocks and hats.    The races themselves, too, are the source of considerable talk and  excitement: both horses and jockeys are well known by sight or  reputation to the chief part of the company, and any \"dark horse\" or new  arrival, is inspected with care and anxiety by his rivals.    The class of horse entered varies between the three-quarter bred and the  \"criollo\" with no pretence to breeding at all, who often carries off the  short polo pony sprints. Occasionally there may be a thoroughbred  entered who has been found wanting at Palermo or Hurlingham, but these  are few and not always successful, as the longest races do not often  exceed about a mile and a-half. As the weights correspond to  steeplechase weights at home the jockeys are practically always  amateurs, and a large percentage of \"owners up\" is always found. Young  mayor-domos who have never ridden at a meeting before often find  themselves ranged alongside of Grand National riders at the start, and  some amusing incidents have occurred, though there is some very good  amateur riding to be seen as well.    The betting is on a smaller scale generally than at the native meeting,  and is often conducted by someone setting up as a public bookmaker; at  other times a \"sport\" is formed after the fashion of Palermo. Also the  auction of all entries before the start of the races in the American way  is a great favourite; the total receipts for each race are divided  proportionately between those who bought the winner and \"placed\" horses.    There is opportunity for a little horse-dealing too, and many good polo  ponies to send home or play in the tournaments have been picked up in  this way. The shorter races for ponies under polo height give an  opportunity to the polo player, and the mayor-domo who cannot train his  ponies for longer distances, to try the mettle of their mounts against  outside and purer blood.    Nowadays most of the entries are trained to some extent, though not  many go to regular training establishments. To have a reasonable chance  of running well in the longer races, however, it is necessary to have  your mounts in stable exercised regularly and fed on corn. It is only  quite lately, however, that even so much training has been adopted at  all generally. In the old pioneer days of English estancias, when these  clubs were formed, they raced ponies taken straight off grass and kept  fit by riding the regular rounds of camp and stock.    There are many tales of the great \"rags\" that happened in those days,  and curious incidents of racing, too. On one occasion a winner of a polo  pony race was objected to as over height. The measurement was to be  taken after the end of the meeting; and it must be remembered that all  ponies out in the camp are unshod. The man who had come in second went  round to the stables before the measuring and noticed in the winner's  stall a number of large pieces of hoof recently chopped off. The pony  passed with an inch off his forefeet and nothing was said, though it had  been obviously over height. That evening at bridge the owner happened to  win considerably from the man who had lodged the complaint, who, when  the score was to be settled, threw down some pieces of hoof on the table  saying, \"Take back your dirty chips.\"    Nowadays, of course, things are not quite so rough and ready, and most  of the clubs are affiliated, and run under Hurlingham or the Jockey Club  rules, so that good sport and good feeling prevail. In fact the camp man  looks forward to these occasions as the best bits of sport and amusement  that he will get during the year.          SUNDAYS IN CAMP.            SUNDAYS IN CAMP.      In no place is Sunday more looked forward to and enjoyed than in camp.  Holidays on the estancia come but seldom, and were it not for the  welcome break that gives the campman a day of rest every week, his life  would be a round of work, and probably make him the proverbial \"dull  boy.\" All the busy working-days are so filled with the various duties  that when evening comes and dinner is over the tired worker has little  inclination for reading or any other relaxation, the thought of that  early bell which rouses him before sunrise makes him take advantage of  every hour's sleep he can. At an hour when the townman is thinking of  beginning the evening's amusement at theatre or concert, the campman is  sleeping the sound sleep that fresh air combined with hard work never  denies. But on one evening an exception is made to these early hours,  and that is Saturday. With the pleasant feeling of a week's work  completed and the morrow's rest before them, our campmen begin their  weekly holiday by an extra hour or two at billiards or music, or perhaps  a rubber of bridge, turning in with a fervid \"Thank goodness,  to-morrow's Sunday.\" Then the pleasure of waking at the usual hour (4  a.m. or even earlier in summer) and remembering that it is the blessed  Day of Rest, and having time to enjoy the extra hours, then the luxury  of dressing at one's leisure, choosing the collar and most becoming tie  and adjusting them with care, and coming out in spotless white duck or  smart riding breeches, ready to enjoy whatever sport is in season;  tennis is mostly played all the year round; and when birds are plentiful  a shoot on the lagunas attracts the sportsman, the \"bag\" making a  welcome variety to the dinner table; snipe, partridge, hares, and many  varieties of duck are common in a season that has not been too dry.  Then, to those lucky ones who have a polo club within reach, Sunday  during the winter season is a day of real enjoyment.    The game, which in England can only be played by men of means, can on  the estancia be enjoyed by all at little expense, the useful little  Argentine horses being easily trained to the game. Sometimes one finds a  few enterprising golfers who, with not a little trouble, make a few  \"greens\" and do a couple of rounds just to keep their hand in, but it is  not a general camp game. It will be seen, however, that the Day of Rest  is not one of idleness, but rather a healthful and beneficial change of  exercise.    Church service enters but seldom into the camp Sunday--such privileges  are rare, although now camp parsons are more numerous than a few years  ago--but at best one can only count on one or two services a year. When  a Church service _is_ held he would be a carping critic indeed who is  not satisfied and pleased with the earnest attention with which the  service is followed and the vigorous singing of hymns and chants in  which all the boys join so lustily; it is a reminder of Home to them,  and the familiar service is thoroughly enjoyed.    The Day of Rest, so essential to one's well-being, seems to come round  with such surprising rapidity that we may say truly it proves that  estancia life, with its long hours of hard work, so far from being  monotonous or wearisome, is a happy life. Where time flies past quickly  it means it passes happily, and amongst the most pleasant of the days we  spend in this land of sunshine we must count the Sundays in camp.    [Illustration: \"A Day of Real Enjoyment.\"]    THE SERVANT PROBLEM IN ARGENTINA.          THE SERVANT PROBLEM IN ARGENTINA.      We often hear complaints from friends at home about the trouble they  experience over obtaining and keeping good servants, and there is no  doubt that the servant problem is a serious one in England, and is  getting worse every year; but it pales into insignificance when compared  with the trials and tribulations of those who live in the Argentine and  have to keep house.    From all one hears, those living in Buenos Aires and the larger towns  have a terrible time of it with their servants, especially if they are  not overburdened with the good things of this world in the shape of hard  cash; but my experiences have been confined to the camp, so that of the  town side of the question I cannot speak.    I have been three years in the province of Cordoba, and all the servants  I have met with except one were Argentines from the foothills of the  Cordoba Sierras.    They were without exception quite untrained as far as the English idea  goes, and the first thing to do with them was usually to teach them the  primitive ideas of cleanliness. The first servant I had was an ancient  female named Andrea, about forty years old, and it proved quite  impossible to get her to see the necessity of keeping anything in the  kitchen clean, as she seemed imbued with the idea that it was great  waste of time washing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14368"],[0,"Hebraic Literature; Translations from the Talmud, Midrashim and Kabbala (#13)"],[1,"Chayim_, chap. 29.    The whole world once believed that the souls of men were perishable, and  that man had no pre-eminence above a beast, till Abraham came and  preached the doctrine of immortality and transmigration.    Ibid., fol. 171, col. 1.    A good son delivers his father from the punishment of hell, for thus we  find that Abraham our father delivered Terah, as it is said in Gen. xv.  15, \"And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace.\" This implies that God  had communicated to him the tidings that his father had a portion in the  world to come and was now \"in peace\" there.    _Pesikta Zotarta_, fol. 3, col. 2.    Before Abraham was circumcised God spake to him in the Chaldee language,  that the angels should not understand it. (This is proved from Gen. xv.  1.)    _Yalkut Chadash_, fol. 117.    Rabbi Levi said Abraham sits at the gate of hell and does not permit any  circumcised Israelite to enter. But if any appear who happen to have  sinned unduly, these he (by an indescribable contrivance) causes to  become uncircumcised and lets pass without scruple into the region of  torment; and this is what is said in Ps. lv. 20, \"He hath put forth his  hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his  covenant.\"    _Yalkut Shimoni_, fol. 33, col. 2, sec. 18.    Abraham was circumcised on the Day of Atonement, and God looks that day  annually on the blood of the covenant of our father Abraham's  circumcision as atoning for all our iniquities, as it is said in Lev.  xvi. 30, \"For on that day shall he make an atonement for you, to cleanse  you from all your sins.\"    _Yalkut Chadash_, fol. 121, col. 1, sec. 3.    \"And it came to pass that when Abram was come into Egypt\" (Gen. xii.  14). And where was Sarah? He confined her in a chest, into which he  locked her, lest any one should gaze on her beauty. When he came to the  receipt of custom, he was summoned to open the chest, but declined, and  offered payment of the duty. The officers said, \"Thou carriest  garments;\" and he offered duty for garments. \"Nay, it is gold thou  carriest;\" and he offered the impost laid on gold. Then they said, \"It  is costly silks, belike pearls, thou concealest;\" and he offered the  custom on such articles. At length the Egyptian officers insisted, and  he opened the box. And when he did so, all the land of Egypt was  illumined by her beauty.    _Bereshith Rabba_, chap. 40.    The question may naturally be asked why Abraham hid his wife from the  gaze of others first then and not before. The reply is to be deduced  from the following double rendering of Gen. xii. 11:--\"Behold now I know  that thou art a fair woman.\" As if to say, \"Usually people lose their  good looks on a long journey, but thou art as beautiful as ever.\" The  second explanation is this:--Abraham was so piously modest that in all  his life he never once looked a female in the face, his own wife not  excepted. As he approached Egypt and was crossing some water, he saw in  it the reflection of her face, and it was then that he exclaimed,  \"Behold now I know that thou art a fair woman.\" As the Egyptians are  swarthy, Abraham at once perceived the magnitude of the danger, and  hence his precaution to hide her beauty in a chest.    _Zeenah Ureenah_ (1877 in Russia), fol. 28, col. 1.    When Abraham came to the cave of Machpelah to bury Sarah, Adam and Eve  rose from their grave and protested against his committing her to the  dust in that receptacle. \"For,\" said they, \"we are ever ashamed in the  presence of the Holy One--blessed be He!--on account of the sin which we  committed, and now comest thou to add to our shame by the contrast  therewith of the good works which ye two have done.\" On Abraham's  assurance that he would intercede with God on their behalf that they  should not bear the shame any longer, Adam immediately retired to his  sepulchre, but Eve being still unwilling to do so, Abraham took her by  the hand and led her back to the side of Adam; and then he buried Sarah.    _Yalkut Chadash_, fol. 14, col. 3, sec. 68.    Abraham's father, Terah, was both an idolater, a manufacturer of idols,  and a dealer in them. Once when Terah had some engagement elsewhere he  left his son Abraham to attend to his business. When a customer came to  purchase an idol, Abraham asked him, \"How old art thou?\" \"Lo! so many  years,\" was the ready reply. \"What,\" exclaimed Abraham, \"is it possible  that a man of so many years should desire to worship a thing only a day  old?\" The customer, being ashamed of himself, went his way; and so did  all other customers, who underwent a similar inquisition. Once an old  woman brought a measure of fine flour and wished to present it as an  offering to the gods. This so enraged Abraham that he took a staff and  broke all the images, excepting the largest, into whose hands he fixed  the staff. When his father came and questioned him about the destruction  of the gods, he replied, \"An old woman placed an offering of flour  before them, which immediately set them all by the ears, for every one  was hungrier than another, but the biggest god killed all the rest with  this staff which thou now seest he still holds in his hands.\"  Superstition, especially when combined with mercenary motives, knows  neither reason nor human affection, therefore the father handed over his  son Abraham to the inquisition of Nimrod, who threw him into the fiery  furnace, as recorded elsewhere in this Miscellany. This is an historical  fact, to the truth of which the whole orthodox Jewish world will bear  testimony, and is solemnly recorded in _Shalsheleth Hakkabalah_ fol. 2,  col 1.    There are three graces:--The grace of a place in the eyes of its  inhabitants; the grace of a woman in the eyes of her husband; the grace  of a purchase in the eyes of the buyer.    _Soteh_, fol. 47, col. 1.    A man should divide his capital into three parts, and invest one-third  in land, employ one-third in merchandise, and reserve one-third in ready  money.    _Bava Metzia_, fol. 42, col. 1.    All who go down to hell shall come up again, except these three:--He who  commits adultery; he who shames another in public; and he who gives  another a bad name.    Ibid., fol. 58, col. 2.    These three complain, but no one sympathizes with them:--He who lends  money without witnesses; he who buys to himself a master; and he who is  lorded over by his wife.    Ibid., fol. 75, col. 2.    There are three things on which the world stands:--The law, the temple  service, and benevolence.    _Avoth_, chap. 1.    If three eat at one table and do not converse together on the law of the  Lord, it is as if they ate from the sacrifices for the dead; but they,  on the contrary, are as if they partook from a table of the Lord's own  furnishing who, while they sit down to meat, season their talk with its  holy precepts.    _Avoth_, chap. 3.    There are three crowns:--The crown of the law, the crown of the  priesthood, and the crown of royalty; but the crown of a good name  surpasses them all.    Ibid., chap. 4.    He who possesses these three virtues is a disciple of Abraham our  father, and he who possesses the three contrary vices is a son of Balaam  the wicked. The disciples of our father Abraham have a kindly eye, a  loyal spirit, and a lowly mind. The disciples of Balaam the wicked have  an evil eye, a proud spirit, and a grasping soul.    Ibid., chap. 5.    Three things are said respecting the children of men:--He who gives alms  brings a blessing on himself; he who lends does better; he who gives  away half of what he hath to spare does best of all.    _Avoth d'Rab. Nathan_, chap. 41.    There are three classes of disciples, and among them three grades of  worth:--He ranks first who asks and answers when asked; he who asks but  does not answer ranks next; but he who neither asks nor answers ranks  lowest of all.    Ibid.    Over these three does God weep every day:--Over him who is able to study  the law but neglects it; over him who studies it amid difficulties hard  to overcome; and over the ruler who behaves arrogantly toward the  community he should protect.    _Chaggigah_, fol. 5, col. 2.    Rabbi Yochanan says there are three keys in the hands of the Holy  One!--blessed be He!--which He never intrusts to the disposal of a  messenger, and they are these:--(1.) The key of rain, (2.) the key of  life, and (3.) the key of reviving the dead. The key of rain, for it is  written (Deut. xxviii. 12), \"The Lord shall open unto thee His good  treasure, the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in season;\" the key  of life, as it is written (Gen. xxx. 22), \"God hearkened unto her, and  opened her womb;\" the key of reviving the dead, for it is written (Ezek.  xxxvii. 13), \"When I have opened your graves, and brought you up out of  your graves, and shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live,\" etc.    _Taanith_, fol. 2, cols, 1, 2.    A disciple of the wise who makes light of the washing of hands is  contemptible; but more contemptible is he who begins to eat before his  guest; more contemptible is that guest who invites another guest; and  still more contemptible is he who begins to eat before a disciple of the  wise; but contemptible before all these three put together is that guest  which troubles another guest.    _Derech Eretz Zuta_, chap. viii.    A roll of the law which has two mistakes to a column should be  corrected; but if there be three, it should be stowed away altogether.    _Menachoth_, fol. 29, col. 2.    The wolf, the lion, the bear, the leopard, the panther, the elephant,  and the sea-cat, each bear three years.    Ibid.    Rav Yehudah says, in the name of Rav, \"The butcher is bound to have  three knives; one to slaughter with, one for cutting up the carcass, and  one to cut away the suet. Suet being as unlawful for food as pork.\"    _Chullin_, fol. 8, col. 2.    Three classes of ministering angels raise a song of praise every day.  One class says, Holy! the second responds, "]]]
