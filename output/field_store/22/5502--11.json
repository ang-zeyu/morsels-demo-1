He was called upon to supervise the guns and stores for the  Army of Italy, and also to inspect the fortifications and artillery of  the coast. At Marseilles his zeal outstripped his discretion. He  ordered the reconstruction of the fortress which had been destroyed  during the Revolution; but when the townsfolk heard the news, they  protested so vehemently that the work was stopped and an order was  issued for Buonaparte's arrest. From this difficulty the friendship of  the younger Robespierre and of Salicetti, the Commissioners of the  Convention, availed to rescue him; but the incident proves that his  services at Toulon were not so brilliant as to have raised him above  the general level of meritorious officers, who were applauded while  they prospered, but might be sent to the guillotine for any serious  offence.    In February, 1794, he was appointed at Nice general in command of the  artillery of the Army of Italy, which drove the Sardinian troops from  several positions between Ventimiglia and Oneglia. Thence, swinging  round by passes of the Maritime Alps, they outflanked the positions of  the Austro-Sardinian forces at the Col di Tenda, which had defied all  attack in front. Buonaparte's share in this turning operation seems to  have been restricted to the effective handling of artillery, and the  chief credit here rested with Massena, who won the first of his  laurels in the country of his birth. He was of humble parentage;  yet his erect bearing, proud animated glance, curt penetrating speech,  and keen repartees, proclaimed a nature at once active and wary, an  intellect both calculating and confident. Such was the man who was to  immortalize his name in many a contest, until his glory paled before  the greater genius of Wellington.    Much of the credit of organizing this previously unsuccessful army  belongs to the younger Robespierre, who, as Commissioner of the  Convention, infused his energy into all departments of the service.  For some months his relations to Buonaparte were those of intimacy;  but whether they extended to complete sympathy on political matters  may be doubted. The younger Robespierre held the revolutionary creed  with sufficient ardour, though one of his letters dated from Oneglia  suggests that the fame of the Terror was hurtful to the prospects of  the campaign. It states that the whole of the neighbouring inhabitants  had fled before the French soldiers, in the belief that they were  destroyers of religion and eaters of babies: this was inconvenient, as  it prevented the supply of provisions and the success of forced loans.  The letter suggests that he was a man of action rather than of ideas,  and probably it was this practical quality which bound Buonaparte in  friendship to him. Yet it is difficult to fathom Buonaparte's ideas  about the revolutionary despotism which was then deluging Paris with  blood. Outwardly he appeared to sympathize with it. Such at least is  the testimony of Marie Robespierre, with whom Buonaparte's sisters  were then intimate. \"Buonaparte,\" she said, \"was a republican: I will  even say that he took the side of the Mountain: at least, that was the  impression left on my mind by his opinions when I was at Nice.... His  admiration for my elder brother, his friendship for my younger  brother, and perhaps also the interest inspired by my misfortunes,  gained for me, under the Consulate, a pension of 3,600 francs.\"[29]  Equally noteworthy is the later declaration of Napoleon that  Robespierre was the \"scapegoat of the Revolution.\" [30] It appears  probable, then, that he shared the Jacobinical belief that the Terror  was a necessary though painful stage in the purification of the body  politic. His admiration of the rigour of Lycurgus, and his dislike of  all superfluous luxury, alike favour this supposition; and as he  always had the courage of his convictions, it is impossible to  conceive him clinging to the skirts of the terrorists merely from a  mean hope of prospective favours. That is the alternative explanation  of his intimacy with young Robespierre. Some of his injudicious  admirers, in trying to disprove his complicity with the terrorists,  impale themselves on this horn of the dilemma. In seeking to clear  him from the charge of Terrorism, they stain him with the charge of  truckling to the terrorists. They degrade him from the level of St.  Just to that of Barrere.    A sentence in one of young Robespierre's letters shows that he never  felt completely sure about the young officer. After enumerating to his  brother Buonaparte's merits, he adds: \"He is a Corsican, and offers  only the guarantee of a man of that nation who has resisted the  caresses of Paoli and whose property has been ravaged by that  traitor.\" Evidently, then, Robespierre regarded Buonaparte with some  suspicion as an insular Proteus, lacking those sureties, mental and  pecuniary, which reduced a man to dog-like fidelity.    Yet, however warily Buonaparte picked his steps along the slopes of  the revolutionary volcano, he was destined to feel the scorch of the  central fires. He had recently been intrusted with a mission to the  Genoese Republic, which was in a most difficult position. It was  subject to pressure from three sides; from English men-of-war that had  swooped down on a French frigate, the \"Modeste,\" in Genoese waters;  and from actual invasion by the French on the west and by the  Austrians on the north. Despite the great difficulties of his task, the  young envoy bent the distracted Doge and Senate to his will. He  might, therefore, have expected gratitude from his adopted country;  but shortly after he returned to Nice he was placed under arrest, and  was imprisoned in a fort near Antibes.    The causes of this swift reverse of fortune were curiously complex.  The Robespierres had in the meantime been guillotined at Paris (July  28th, or Thermidor 10th); and this \"Thermidorian\" reaction alone would  have sufficed to endanger Buonaparte's head. But his position was  further imperilled by his recent strategic suggestions, which had  served to reduce to a secondary _role_ the French Army of the Alps.  The operations of that force had of late been strangely thwarted; and  its leaders, searching for the paralyzing influence, discovered it in  the advice of Buonaparte. Their suspicions against him were formulated  in a secret letter to the Committee of Public Safety, which stated  that the Army of the Alps had been kept inactive by the intrigues of  the younger Robespierre and of Ricord. Many a head had fallen for  reasons less serious than these. But Buonaparte had one infallible  safeguard: he could not well be spared. After a careful examination of  his papers, the Commissioners, Salicetti and Albitte, provisionally  restored him to liberty, but not, for some weeks, to his rank of  general (August 20th, 1794). The chief reason assigned for his  liberation was the service which his knowledge and talents might  render to the Republic, a reference to the knowledge of the Italian  coast-line which he had gained during the mission to Genoa.    For a space his daring spirit was doomed to chafe in comparative  inactivity, in supervising the coast artillery. But his faults were  forgotten in the need which was soon felt for his warlike prowess. An  expedition was prepared to free Corsica from \"the tyranny of the  English\"; and in this Buonaparte sailed, as general commanding the  artillery. With him were two friends, Junot and Marmont, who had clung  to him through his recent troubles; the former was to be helped to  wealth and fame by Buonaparte's friendship, the latter by his own  brilliant gifts.[31] In this expedition their talent was of no avail.  The French were worsted in an engagement with the British fleet, and  fell back in confusion to the coast of France. Once again Buonaparte's  Corsican enterprises were frustrated by the ubiquitous lords of the  sea: against them he now stored up a double portion of hate, for in  the meantime his inspectorship of coast artillery had been given to  his fellow-countryman, Casabianca.    The fortunes of these Corsican exiles drifted hither and thither in  many perplexing currents, as Buonaparte was once more to discover. It  was a prevalent complaint that there were too many of them seeking  employment in the army of the south; and a note respecting the career  of the young officer made by General Scherer, who now commanded the  French Army of Italy, shows that Buonaparte had aroused at least as  much suspicion as admiration. It runs: \"This officer is general of  artillery, and in this arm has sound knowledge, but has somewhat too  much ambition and intriguing habits for his advancement.\" All things  considered, it was deemed advisable to transfer him to the army which  was engaged in crushing the Vendean revolt, a service which he loathed  and was determined, if possible, to evade. Accompanied by his faithful  friends, Marmont and Junot, as also by his young brother Louis, he set  out for Paris (May, 1795).    In reality Fortune never favoured him more than when she removed him  from the coteries of intriguing Corsicans on the coast of Provence and  brought him to the centre of all influence. An able schemer at Paris  could decide the fate of parties and governments. At the frontiers men  could only accept the decrees of the omnipotent capital. Moreover, the  Revolution, after passing through the molten stage, was now beginning  to solidify, an important opportunity for the political craftsman. The  spring of the year 1795 witnessed a strange blending of the new  fanaticism with the old customs. Society, dammed up for a time by the  Spartan rigour of Robespierre, was now flowing back"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14314"],[0,"Etiquette (#13)"],[1,"a weed will grow all over the place if you  let it have half a chance. A very good resolve to make and keep, if you  would also keep any friends you make, is never to speak of anyone without,  in imagination, having them overhear what you say. One often hears the  exclamation \"I would say it to her face!\" At least be very sure that this  is true, and not a braggart's phrase and then--nine times out of ten think  better of it and refrain. Preaching is all very well in a text-book,  schoolroom or pulpit, but it has no place in society. Society is supposed  to be a pleasant place; telling people disagreeable things to their faces  or behind their backs is _not_ a pleasant occupation.    Do not be too apparently clever if you would be popular. The cleverest  woman is she who, in talking to a man, makes _him_ seem clever. This was  Mme. Recamier's great charm.      =A FEW MAXIMS FOR THOSE WHO TALK TOO MUCH--AND EASILY!=    The faults of commission are far more serious than those of omission;  regrets are seldom for what you left unsaid.    The chatterer reveals every corner of his shallow mind; one who keeps  silent can not have his depth plumbed.    Don't pretend to know more than you do. To say you have read a book and  then seemingly to understand nothing of what you have read, proves you a  half-wit. Only the very small mind hesitates to say \"I don't know.\"    Above all, stop and _think_ what you are saying! This is really the first,  last and only rule. If you \"stop\" you can't chatter or expound or flounder  ceaselessly, and if you _think_, you will find a topic and a manner of  presenting your topic so that your neighbor will be interested rather than  long-suffering.    Remember also that the sympathetic (not apathetic) listener is the delight  of delights. The person who looks glad to see you, who is seemingly eager  for your news, or enthralled with your conversation; who looks at you with  a kindling of the face, and gives you spontaneous and undivided attention,  is the one to whom the palm for the art of conversation would undoubtedly  be awarded.          CHAPTER VIII    WORDS, PHRASES AND PRONUNCIATION      =PHRASES AVOIDED IN GOOD SOCIETY=    It is difficult to explain why well-bred people avoid certain words and  expressions that are admitted by etymology and grammar. So it must be  merely stated that they have and undoubtedly always will avoid them.  Moreover, this choice of expression is not set forth in any printed guide  or book on English, though it is followed in all literature.    To liken Best Society to a fraternity, with the avoidance of certain  seemingly unimportant words as the sign of recognition, is not a fantastic  simile. People of the fashionable world invariably use certain expressions  and instinctively avoid others; therefore when a stranger uses an  \"avoided\" one he proclaims that he \"does not belong,\" exactly as a  pretended Freemason proclaims himself an \"outsider\" by giving the wrong  \"grip\"--or whatever it is by which Brother Masons recognize one another.    People of position are people of position the world over--and by their  speech are most readily known. Appearance on the other hand often passes  muster. A \"show-girl\" may be lovely to look at as she stands in a  seemingly unstudied position and in perfect clothes. But let her say \"My  Gawd!\" or \"Wouldn't that jar you!\" and where is her loveliness then?    And yet, and this is the difficult part of the subject to make clear, the  most vulgar slang like that quoted above, is scarcely worse than the  attempted elegance which those unused to good society imagine to be the  evidence of cultivation.    People who say \"I come,\" and \"I seen it,\" and \"I done it\" prove by their  lack of grammar that they had little education in their youth.  Unfortunate, very; but they may at the same time be brilliant, exceptional  characters, loved by everyone who knows them, because they are what they  seem and nothing else. But the caricature \"lady\" with the comic picture  \"society manner\" who says \"Pardon _me_\" and talks of \"retiring,\" and  \"residing,\" and \"desiring,\" and \"being acquainted with,\" and \"attending\"  this and that with \"her escort,\" and curls her little finger over the  handle of her teacup, and prates of \"culture,\" does not belong to Best  Society, and _never_ will! The offense of pretentiousness is committed  oftener perhaps by women than by men, who are usually more natural and  direct. A genuine, sincere, kindly American man--or woman--can go anywhere  and be welcomed by everyone, provided of course, that he is a man of  ability and intellect. One finds him all over the world, neither aping the  manners of others nor treading on the sensibilities of those less  fortunate than himself.    Occasionally too, there appears in Best Society a provincial in whose  conversation is perceptible the influence of much reading of the Bible.  Such are seldom if ever stilted or pompous or long-worded, but are  invariably distinguished for the simplicity and dignity of their English.    There is no better way to cultivate taste in words, than by constantly  reading the best English. None of the words and expressions which are  taboo in good society will be found in books of proved literary standing.  But it must not be forgotten that there can be a vast difference between  literary standing and popularity, and that many of the \"best sellers\" have  no literary merit whatsoever.    To be able to separate best English from merely good English needs a long  process of special education, but to recognize bad English one need merely  skim through a page of a book, and if a single expression in the left-hand  column following can be found (unless purposely quoted in illustration of  vulgarity) it is quite certain that the author neither writes best English  nor belongs to Best Society.

As examples of the very worst offenses that can be committed, the  following are offered:    \"Pray, accept my thanks for the flattering ovation you have tendered me.\"    \"Yes,\" says the preposterous bride, \"I am the recipient of many admired  and highly prized gifts.\"    \"Will you permit me to recall myself to you?\"    Speaking of bridesmaids as \"pretty servitors,\" \"dispensing hospitality,\"  asking any one to \"step this way.\"    Many other expressions are provincial and one who seeks purity of speech  should, if possible, avoid them, but as \"offenses\" they are minor:    Reckon, guess, calculate, or figure, meaning think.    Allow, meaning agree.    Folks, meaning family.    Cute, meaning pretty or winsome.    Well, I declare! 'Pon my word!    Box party, meaning sitting in a box at the theater.    Visiting with, meaning talking to.    There are certain words which have been singled out and misused by the  undiscriminating until their value is destroyed. Long ago \"elegant\" was  turned from a word denoting the essence of refinement and beauty, into  gaudy trumpery. \"Refined\" is on the verge. But the pariah of the language  is culture! A word rarely used by those who truly possess it, but so  constantly misused by those who understand nothing of its meaning, that it  is becoming a synonym for vulgarity and imitation. To speak of the proper  use of a finger bowl or the ability to introduce two people without a  blunder as being \"evidence of culture of the highest degree\" is precisely  as though evidence of highest education were claimed for who ever can do  sums in addition, and read words of one syllable. Culture in its true  meaning is widest possible education, _plus_ especial refinement and  taste.    The fact that slang is apt and forceful makes its use irresistibly  tempting. Coarse or profane slang is beside the mark, but \"flivver,\"  \"taxi,\" the \"movies"]]]
