Followed a groan of  woodwork submitted to sudden strain--and the unmistakable pad of bare  feet upon the linoleum of the top corridor.    I knew now that one of Dr. Fu-Manchu's uncanny servants had gained the  roof of the house by some means, had broken through the skylight and  had descended by means of the trap beneath on to the landing.    In such a tensed-up state as I cannot describe, nor, at this hour  mentally reconstruct, I waited for the creaking of the stairs which  should tell of the creature's descent.    I was disappointed. Removed scarce a yard from me as he was, I could  hear Nayland Smith's soft, subdued breathing; but my eyes were all for  the darkened hall-way, for the smudgy outline of the stair-rail with  the faint patterning in the background, which, alone, indicated the  wall.    It was amid an utter silence, unheralded by even so slight a sound as  those which I had acquired the power of detecting--that I saw the  continuity of the smudgy line of stair-rail to be interrupted.    A dark patch showed upon it, just within my line of sight, invisible  to Smith on the other side of the doorway, and some ten or twelve  stairs up.    No sound reached me, but the dark patch vanished--and reappeared three  feet lower down.    Still I knew that this phantom approach must be unknown to my  companion--and I knew that it was impossible for me to advise him of  it unseen by the dreaded visitor.    A third time the dark patch--the hand of one who, ghostly, silent, was  creeping down into the hall-way--vanished and reappeared on a level  with my eyes. Then a vague shape became visible; no more than a blur  upon the dim design of the wall-paper ... and Nayland Smith got his  first sight of the stranger.    The clock on the mantelpiece boomed out the half-hour.    At that, such was my state (I blush to relate it), I uttered a faint  cry!    It ended all secrecy--that hysterical weakness of mine. It might have  frustrated our hopes; that it did not do so was in no measure due to  me. But in a sort of passionate whirl, the ensuing events moved  swiftly.    Smith hesitated not one instant. With a panther-like leap he hurled  himself into the hall.    \"The lights, Petrie!\" he cried, \"the lights! The switch is near the  street door!\"    I clenched my fists in a swift effort to regain control of my  treacherous nerves, and, bounding past Smith, and past the foot of the  stair, I reached out my hand to the switch, the situation of which,  fortunately, I knew.    Around I came, in response to a shrill cry from behind me--an inhuman  cry, less a cry than the shriek of some enraged animal....    With his left foot upon the first stair, Nayland Smith stood, his lean  body bent perilously backward, his arms rigidly thrust out, and his  sinewy fingers gripping the throat of an almost naked man--a man whose  brown body glistened unctuously, whose shaven head was apish low,  whose bloodshot eyes were the eyes of a mad dog! His teeth, upper and  lower, were bared; they glistened, they gnashed, and a froth was on  his lips. With both his hands, he clutched a heavy stick, and  once--twice, he brought it down upon Nayland Smith's head!    I leapt forward to my friend's aid; but as though the blows had been  those of a feather, he stood like some figure of archaic statuary, nor  for an instant relaxed the death-grip which he had upon his  adversary's throat.    Thrusting my way up the stairs, I wrenched the stick from the hand of  the dacoit--for in this glistening brown man I recognized one of that  deadly brotherhood who hailed Dr. Fu-Manchu their Lord and Master.           *       *       *       *       *    I cannot dwell upon the end of that encounter; I cannot hope to make  acceptable to my readers an account of how Nayland Smith, glassy-eyed,  and with consciousness ebbing from him instant by instant, stood  there, a realization of Leighton's \"Athlete,\" his arms rigid as iron  bars even after Fu-Manchu's servant hung limply in that frightful  grip.    In his last moment of consciousness, with the blood from his wounded  head trickling down into his eyes, he pointed to the stick which I had  torn from the grip of the dacoit, and which I still held in my hand.    \"Not Aaron's rod, Petrie!\" he gasped hoarsely ... \"the rod of  Moses!--Slattin's stick!\"    Even in upon my anxiety for my friend, amazement intruded.    \"But,\" I began--and turned to the rack in which Slattin's favourite  cane at that moment reposed--had reposed at the time of his death.    Yes! There stood Slattin's cane; we had not moved it; we had disturbed  nothing in that stricken house; there it stood, in company with an  umbrella and a malacca.    I glanced at the cane in my hand. Surely there could not be two such  in the world?    Smith collapsed on the floor at my feet.    \"Examine the one in the rack, Petrie,\" he whispered, almost inaudibly,  \"but do not touch it. It may not be yet....\"    I propped him up against the foot of the stairs, and as the constable  began knocking violently at the street door, crossed to the rack and  lifted out the replica of the cane which I held in my hand.    A faint cry from Smith--and as if it had been a leprous thing, I  dropped the cane instantly.    \"Merciful God!\" I groaned.    Although, in every other particular, it corresponded with that which I  held--which I had taken from the dacoit--which he had come to  substitute for the cane now lying upon the floor--in one dreadful  particular it differed.    Up to the snake's head it was an accurate copy; _but the head lived_!    Either from pain, fear, or starvation, the thing confined in the  hollow tube of this awful duplicate was become torpid. Otherwise, no  power on earth could have saved me from the fate of Abel Slattin; for  the creature was an Australian death-adder.          CHAPTER XI    THE WHITE PEACOCK      Nayland Smith wasted no time in pursuing the plan of campaign which he  had mentioned to Inspector Weymouth. Less than forty-eight hours after  quitting the house of the murdered Slattin I found myself bound along  Whitechapel Road upon strange enough business.    A very fine rain was falling, which rendered it difficult to see  clearly from the windows; but the weather apparently had little effect  upon the commercial activities of the district. The cab was threading  a hazardous way through the cosmopolitan throng crowding the street.  On either side of me extended a row of stalls, seemingly established  in opposition to the more legitimate shops upon the inner side of the  pavement.    Jewish hawkers, many of them in their shirt-sleeves, acclaimed the  rarity of the bargains which they had to offer; and, allowing for the  difference of costume, these tireless Israelites, heedless of climatic  conditions, sweating at their mongery, might well have stood, not in  a squalid London thoroughfare, but in an equally squalid market-street  of the Orient.    They offered linen and fine raiment; from foot-gear to hair-oil their  wares ranged. They enlivened their auctioneering with conjuring tricks  and witty stories, selling watches by the aid of legerdemain, and  fancy vests by grace of a seasonable anecdote.    Poles, Russians, Serbs, Roumanians, Jews of Hungary, and Italians of  Whitechapel mingled in the throng. Near East and Far East rubbed  shoulders. Pidgin English contested with Yiddish for the ownership of  some tawdry article offered by an auctioneer whose nationality defied  conjecture, save that always some branch of his ancestry had drawn  nourishment from the soil of Eternal Judaea.    Some wearing men's caps, some with shawls thrown over their oily  locks, and some, more true to primitive instincts, defying,  bare-headed, the unkindly elements, bedraggled women--more often than  not burdened with muffled infants--crowded the pavements and the  roadway, thronged about the stalls like white ants about some choicer  carrion.    And the fine drizzling rain fell upon all alike, pattering upon the  hood of the taxi-cab; trickling down the front windows; glistening  upon the unctuous hair of those in the street who were hatless; dewing  the bare arms of the auctioneers, and dripping, melancholy, from the  tarpaulin coverings of the stalls. Heedless of the rain above and of  the mud beneath, North, South, East and West mingled their cries,  their bids, their blandishments, their raillery, mingled their persons  in that joyless throng.    Sometimes a yellow face showed close to one of the streaming windows;  sometimes a black-eyed, pallid face, but never a face wholly sane and  healthy. This was an underworld where squalor and vice went hand in  hand through the beautiless streets, a melting-pot of the world's  outcasts; this was the shadowland which last night had swallowed up  Nayland Smith.    Ceaselessly I peered to right and left, searching amid that  rain-soaked company for any face known to me. Whom I expected to find  there, I know not, but I should have counted it no matter for surprise  had I detected amid that ungracious ugliness the beautiful face of  Karamaneh, the Eastern slave-girl, the leering yellow face of a  Burmese dacoit, the gaunt, bronze features of Nayland Smith; a hundred  times I almost believed that I had seen the ruddy countenance of  Inspector Weymouth, and once (at what instant my heart seemed to stand  still) I suffered from the singular delusion that the oblique green  eyes of Dr. Fu-Manchu peered out from the shadows between two stalls.    It was mere phantasy, of course, the sick imaginings of a mind  overwrought. I had not slept and had scarcely tasted food for more  than thirty hours; for, following up a faint clue supplied by Burke,  Slattin's man, and, like his master, an ex-officer of New York Police,  my friend, Nayland Smith, on the previous evening, had set out in  quest of some obscene den where the man called Shen-Yan--former keeper  of an opium shop-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19145"],[0,"The Time Traders (#13)"],[1,"'ll bet he's hungry.\"    He took the direct route back to the marsh, but this time no thread of  smoke spiraled into the air. Ross hesitated. That shelter on the small  island was surely the place where McNeil had holed up. Should he try to  work his way out to it now? Or had something happened to the man while  he was gone?    Again that sixth sense of impending disaster, which is perhaps bred into  some men, alerted Ross. Why he turned suddenly and backed against a  bushy willow, he could not have explained. However, because he did so  the loop of hide rope meant for his throat hit his shoulder harmlessly.  It fell to the ground, and he stamped one boot down on it. Then it was  the work of seconds to grasp it and give it a quick jerk. The surprised  man who held the other end was brought sprawling into the open.    Ross had seen that round face before. \"Lal of the town of Nodren.\" He  found words to greet the ropeman even as his knee came up against the  fellow's jaw, jarring Lal so that he dropped a flint knife. Ross kicked  it into the willows. \"What do you hunt here, Lal?\"    \"Traders!\" The voice was weak, but it held heat.    The tribesman did not try to struggle against Ross's hold, and Ross,  gripping him by the nape of the neck, moved through a screen of brush to  a hollow. Luckily there was no water cupped there, for McNeil lay in the  bottom of that dip, his arms tied tightly behind him and his ankles  lashed together with no thought for the pain of his burned leg.          CHAPTER 7      Ross whirled the rope which had been meant to bring him down around Lal.  He lashed the tribesman's arms tight to his body before he knelt to cut  loose his fellow time traveler. Lal now huddled against the far wall of  the cup, fear in every line of his small body. So apparent was this fear  that Ross felt no satisfaction at turning the tables on him. Instead he  felt increasingly uneasy.    \"What is this all about?\" he asked McNeil as he stripped off his bonds  and helped him up.    McNeil massaged his wrists, took a step or two, and grimaced with pain.  \"Our friend seeks to be an obedient servant of Lurgha.\"    Ross picked up his bow. \"The tribe is out to hunt us?\"    \"Lurgha has ordered--out of thin air again--that any traders who escaped  are to be brought in and introduced to him personally at the sacrifice  for the enrichment of the fields!\"    The old, old gift of blood and life at the spring sowing. Ross recalled  grisly details from his cram lessons. Any wandering stranger or enemy  tribesman taken in a raid before that day would meet such a fate. On  unlucky years when people were not available a deer or wolf might serve.  But the best sacrifice of all was a man. So Lurgha had decreed--from the  air--that traders were his meat? What of Ashe? Let any hunter from the  village track him down.    \"We have to move fast,\" Ross told McNeil as he took up the rope which  made a leading cord for Lal. Ashe would want to question the tribesman  about this second order from Lurgha.    Impatient as Ross was, he had to mend his pace to accommodate McNeil.  The man from the hill post was close to the end of his strength. He had  started off bravely enough, but now he wavered. Ross sent Lal ahead with  a sharp push, ordering him to stay there, while he went to McNeil's aid.  It was well into the afternoon before they came up the stream and saw  the fire before the cave.    \"Macna!\" Ashe hailed Ross's companion with the native version of his  name. \"And Lal. But what do you here, Lal of Nodren's town?\"    \"Mischief.\" Ross helped McNeil within the cave and to the pile of brush  which was his own bed. \"He was hunting traders as a present for Lurgha.\"    \"So--\" Ashe turned upon the tribesman--\"and by whose word did you go  hunting my kinsman, Lal? Was it Nodren's? Has he forgotten the blood  bond between us? For it was in the name of Lurgha himself that that bond  was made----\"    \"Aaaah--\" The tribesman squatted down against the wall where Ross had  shoved him. Unable to hide his head in his arms, he brought his face  down upon his knees so that only his shaggy topknot of hair was exposed.  Ross realized, with stupefaction, that the little man was crying like a  child, his hunched shoulders rising and falling with the force of his  sobs. \"Aaaah--\" he wailed.    Ashe allowed him a moment or two of noisy grief and then limped over to  grasp his topknot and pull up his head. Lal's eyes were screwed tightly  shut, but there were tears on his cheeks, and his mouth twisted in  another wail.    \"Be quiet!\" Ashe shook him, but not too harshly. \"Have you yet felt the  bite of my sharp knife? Has an arrow holed your skin? You are alive, and  you could be dead. Show that you are glad you live and continue to  breathe by telling us what you know, Lal.\"    The woman Cassca had displayed a measure of intelligence and ease at  their meeting upon the road. But it was very plain that Lal was of  different stuff, a simple man in whose head few ideas could find house  room at one time. And to him the present was all black. Little by little  they dragged the story out of him.    Lal was poor, so poor that he had never dared dream of owning for  himself some of the precious things the hill traders displayed to the  wealthy of Nodren's town. But he was also a follower of the Great  Mother's, rather than one who made sacrifices to Lurgha. Lurgha was the  god for warriors and great men; he was too high to concern himself with  such as Lal.    So when Nodren reported the end of the hill post under the storm fist of  Lurgha, Lal had been impressed only to a point. He was still convinced  it was none of his concern, and instead he began thinking of the  treasures which might lie hidden in the destroyed buildings. It occurred  to him that Lurgha's Wrath had been laid upon the men who had owned  them, but perhaps it would not stretch to the fine things themselves. So  he had gone secretly to the hill to explore.    What he had seen there had utterly converted him to a belief in the fury  of Lurgha and he had been frightened out of his simple wits, fleeing  without making the search he had intended. But Lurgha had seen him  there, had read his impious thoughts....    At that point Ashe interrupted the stream of Lal's story. How had Lurgha  seen Lal?    Because--Lal shuddered, began to cry again, and spoke the next few  sentences haltingly--that very morning when he had gone out to hunt wild  fowl in the marshes Lurgha had spoken to _him_, to Lal, who was less  than a flea creeping upon a worn-out fur rug.    And how had Lurgha spoken? Ashe's voice was softer, gentle.    Out of the air, even as he had spoken to Nodren, who was a chief. He  said that he had seen Lal in the hill post, and so Lal was his meat. But  not yet would he eat him, not if Lal served him in other ways. And he,  Lal, had lain flat on the ground before the bodiless voice of Lurgha and  had sworn that he would serve Lurgha to the end of his life.    Then Lurgha had told him to hunt down one of the evil traders who was  hiding in the marshes, and bind him with ropes. Then he was to call the  men of the village and together they would carry the prisoner to the  hill where Lurgha had loosed his wrath, and there they would leave him.  Later they might return and take what they found there and use it to  bless the fields at sowing time, and all would be well with Nodren's  village. And Lal had sworn that he would do as Lurgha bade, but now he  could not. So Lurgha would eat him up--he was a man without hope.    \"Yet,\" Ashe said even more gently, \"have you not served the Great Mother  all these years, giving to her a portion of the first fruits even when  the yield of your one field was small?\"    Lal stared at him, his woebegone face still smeared with tears. It took  a second or two for the question to penetrate his fear-clouded mind.  Then he nodded timidly.    \"Has she not dealt with you well in return, Lal? You are a poor man,  that is true. But you are not gaunt of belly, even though this is the  thin season when men fast before the coming of the new harvest. The  Great Mother watches over her own. And it is she who has brought you to  us now. For this I say to you, Lal, and I, Assha of the traders, speak  with a straight tongue. The Lurgha who struck our post, who spoke to you  from the air, means you no good----\"    \"Aaaah!\" wailed Lal. \"So do I know, Assha. He is of the blackness and  the wandering spirits of the dark!\"    \"Just so. Thus he is no kin to the mother, for she is of the light and  of good things, of the new grain, and the newborn lambs for your flocks,  of the maids who wed with men and bring forth sons to lift their  fathers' spears, daughters to spin by the hearth and sow the yellow  grain in the furrows. Lurgha's quarrel lies with us, Lal, not with  Nodren nor with you. And we take upon us that quarrel.\" He limped into  the outer air where the shadows of evening were beginning to creep  across the ground.    \"Hear me, Lurgha,\" he called into the coming night, \"I am Assha of the  traders, and upon myself I take your hate. Not upon Lal, nor upon  Nodren, nor upon the people who live in Nodren's town, shall your wrath  lie. Thus do I say it!\"    Ross, noticing that Ashe concealed from Lal a wave of his hand, was  prepared for some display meant to impress the tribesman. It came in a  spectacular burst of green fire beyond the stream. Lal wailed again, but  when that fire was followed by no other manifestation he ventured to  raise his head once more.    \"You have seen how Lurgha answered me, Lal. Toward me only will his  wrath be turned. Now--\" Ashe limped back and dragged out the white wolf  skin, dropping it before Lal--\"this you will give to Cassca that she may  make a curtain for the Mother's home. See, it is white and so rare that  the Mother will be pleased with such a fine gift. And you will tell her  all that has chanced and how you believe in her powers over"]]]
