I think she has actually done this, and as a sign of this identification  she has created an unfulfilled wish in reality. But what is the meaning  of this hysterical identification? To clear this up a thorough  exposition is necessary. Identification is a highly important factor in  the mechanism of hysterical symptoms; by this means patients are enabled  in their symptoms to represent not merely their own experiences, but the  experiences of a great number of other persons, and can suffer, as it  were, for a whole mass of people, and fill all the parts of a drama by  means of their own personalities alone. It will here be objected that  this is well-known hysterical imitation, the ability of hysteric  subjects to copy all the symptoms which impress them when they occur in  others, as though their pity were stimulated to the point of  reproduction. But this only indicates the way in which the psychic  process is discharged in hysterical imitation; the way in which a  psychic act proceeds and the act itself are two different things. The  latter is slightly more complicated than one is apt to imagine the  imitation of hysterical subjects to be: it corresponds to an unconscious  concluded process, as an example will show. The physician who has a  female patient with a particular kind of twitching, lodged in the  company of other patients in the same room of the hospital, is not  surprised when some morning he learns that this peculiar hysterical  attack has found imitations. He simply says to himself: The others have  seen her and have done likewise: that is psychic infection. Yes, but  psychic infection proceeds in somewhat the following manner: As a rule,  patients know more about one another than the physician knows about each  of them, and they are concerned about each other when the visit of the  doctor is over. Some of them have an attack to-day: soon it is known  among the rest that a letter from home, a return of lovesickness or the  like, is the cause of it. Their sympathy is aroused, and the following  syllogism, which does not reach consciousness, is completed in them: \"If  it is possible to have this kind of an attack from such causes, I too  may have this kind of an attack, for I have the same reasons.\" If this  were a cycle capable of becoming conscious, it would perhaps express  itself in _fear_ of getting the same attack; but it takes place in  another psychic sphere, and, therefore, ends in the realization of the  dreaded symptom. Identification is therefore not a simple imitation, but  a sympathy based upon the same etiological claim; it expresses an \"as  though,\" and refers to some common quality which has remained in the  unconscious.    Identification is most often used in hysteria to express sexual  community. An hysterical woman identifies herself most readily--although  not exclusively--with persons with whom she has had sexual relations, or  who have sexual intercourse with the same persons as herself. Language  takes such a conception into consideration: two lovers are \"one.\" In the  hysterical phantasy, as well as in the dream, it is sufficient for the  identification if one thinks of sexual relations, whether or not they  become real. The patient, then, only follows the rules of the hysterical  thought processes when she gives expression to her jealousy of her  friend (which, moreover, she herself admits to be unjustified, in that  she puts herself in her place and identifies herself with her by  creating a symptom--the denied wish). I might further clarify the  process specifically as follows: She puts herself in the place of her  friend in the dream, because her friend has taken her own place relation  to her husband, and because she would like to take her friend's place in  the esteem of her husband[2].    The contradiction to my theory of dreams in the case of another female  patient, the most witty among all my dreamers, was solved in a simpler  manner, although according to the scheme that the non-fulfillment of one  wish signifies the fulfillment of another. I had one day explained to  her that the dream is a wish of fulfillment. The next day she brought me  a dream to the effect that she was traveling with her mother-in-law to  their common summer resort. Now I knew that she had struggled violently  against spending the summer in the neighborhood of her mother-in-law. I  also knew that she had luckily avoided her mother-in-law by renting an  estate in a far-distant country resort. Now the dream reversed this  wished-for solution; was not this in the flattest contradiction to my  theory of wish-fulfillment in the dream? Certainly, it was only  necessary to draw the inferences from this dream in order to get at its  interpretation. According to this dream, I was in the wrong. _It was  thus her wish that I should be in the wrong, and this wish the dream  showed her as fulfilled._ But the wish that I should be in the wrong,  which was fulfilled in the theme of the country home, referred to a more  serious matter. At that time I had made up my mind, from the material  furnished by her analysis, that something of significance for her  illness must have occurred at a certain time in her life. She had denied  it because it was not present in her memory. We soon came to see that I  was in the right. Her wish that I should be in the wrong, which is  transformed into the dream, thus corresponded to the justifiable wish  that those things, which at the time had only been suspected, had never  occurred at all.    Without an analysis, and merely by means of an assumption, I took the  liberty of interpreting a little occurrence in the case of a friend, who  had been my colleague through the eight classes of the Gymnasium. He  once heard a lecture of mine delivered to a small assemblage, on the  novel subject of the dream as the fulfillment of a wish. He went home,  dreamt _that he had lost all his suits_--he was a lawyer--and then  complained to me about it. I took refuge in the evasion: \"One can't win  all one's suits,\" but I thought to myself: \"If for eight years I sat as  Primus on the first bench, while he moved around somewhere in the middle  of the class, may he not naturally have had a wish from his boyhood days  that I, too, might for once completely disgrace myself?\"    In the same way another dream of a more gloomy character was offered me  by a female patient as a contradiction to my theory of the wish-dream.  The patient, a young girl, began as follows: \"You remember that my  sister has now only one boy, Charles: she lost the elder one, Otto,  while I was still at her house. Otto was my favorite; it was I who  really brought him up. I like the other little fellow, too, but of  course not nearly as much as the dead one. Now I dreamt last night that  _I saw Charles lying dead before me. He was lying in his little coffin,  his hands folded: there were candles all about, and, in short, it was  just like the time of little Otto's death, which shocked me so  profoundly_. Now tell me, what does this mean? You know me: am I really  bad enough to wish my sister to lose the only child she has left? Or  does the dream mean that I wish Charles to be dead rather than Otto,  whom I like so much better?\"    I assured her that this interpretation was impossible. After some  reflection I was able to give her the interpretation of the dream, which  I subsequently made her confirm.    Having become an orphan at an early age, the girl had been brought up in  the house of a much older sister, and had met among the friends and  visitors who came to the house, a man who made a lasting impression upon  her heart. It looked for a time as though these barely expressed  relations were to end in marriage, but this happy culmination was  frustrated by the sister, whose motives have never found a complete  explanation. After the break, the man who was loved by our patient  avoided the house: she herself became independent some time after little  Otto's death, to whom her affection had now turned. But she did not  succeed in freeing herself from the inclination for her sister's friend  in which she had become involved. Her pride commanded her to avoid him;  but it was impossible for her to transfer her love to the other suitors  who presented themselves in order. Whenever the man whom she loved, who  was a member of the literary profession, announced a lecture anywhere,  she was sure to be found in the audience; she also seized every other  opportunity to see him from a distance unobserved by him. I remembered  that on the day before she had told me that the Professor was going to a  certain concert, and that she was also going there, in order to enjoy  the sight of him. This was on the day of the dream; and the concert was  to take place on the day on which she told me the dream. I could now  easily see the correct interpretation, and I asked her whether she could  think of any event which had happened after the death of little Otto.  She answered immediately: \"Certainly; at that time the Professor  returned after a long absence, and I saw him once more beside the coffin  of little Otto.\" It was exactly as I had expected. I interpreted the  dream in the following manner: \"If now the other boy were to die, the  same thing would be repeated. You would spend the day with your sister,  the Professor would surely come in order to offer condolence, and you  would see him again under the same circumstances as at that time. The  dream signifies nothing but this wish of yours to see him again, against  which you are fighting inwardly. I know that you are carrying the ticket  for to-day's concert in your bag. Your dream is a dream of impatience;  it has anticipated the meeting which is to take place to-day by several  hours.\"    In order to disguise her wish she had obviously"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1549"],[0,"Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians (#13)"],[1,", we have need of a far better  mediator than Moses or the Law. We must know that we are nothing. We  must understand that we are merely beneficiaries and recipients of the  treasures of Christ.    So far, the words of Paul were addressed to Peter. Now Paul turns to the  Galatians and makes this summary statement:        VERSE 16. For by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.    By the term \"flesh\" Paul does not understand manifest vices. Such sins  he usually calls by their proper names, as adultery, fornication, etc.  By \"flesh\" Paul understands what Jesus meant in the third chapter of  John, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh\". (John 3:6.) \"Flesh\"  here means the whole nature of man, inclusive of reason and instincts.  \"This flesh,\" says Paul, \"is not justified by the works of the law.\"    The papists do not believe this. They say, \"A person who performs this  good deed or that, deserves the forgiveness of his sins. A person who  joins this or that holy order, has the promise of everlasting life.\"    To me it is a miracle that the Church, so long surrounded by vicious  sects, has been able to survive at all. God must have been able to call  a few who in their failure to discover any good in themselves to cite  against the wrath and judgment of God, simply took to the suffering and  death of Christ, and were saved by this simple faith.    Nevertheless God has punished the contempt of the Gospel and of Christ  on the part of the papists, by turning them over to a reprobate state  of mind in which they reject the Gospel, and receive with gusto the  abominable rules, ordinances, and traditions of men in preference to the  Word of God, until they went so far as to forbid marriage. God punished  them justly, because they blasphemed the only Son of God.    This is, then, our general conclusion: \"By the works of the law shall no  flesh be justified.\"        VERSE 17. But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves    also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God    forbid.    Either we are not justified by Christ, or we are not justified by  the Law. The fact is, we are justified by Christ. Hence, we are not  justified by the Law. If we observe the Law in order to be justified,  or after having been justified by Christ, we think we must further be  justified by the Law, we convert Christ into a legislator and a minister  of sin.    \"What are these false apostles doing?\" Paul cries. \"They are turning Law  into grace, and grace into Law. They are changing Moses into Christ, and  Christ into Moses. By teaching that besides Christ and His righteousness  the performance of the Law is necessary unto salvation, they put the Law  in the place of Christ, they attribute to the Law the power to save, a  power that belongs to Christ only.\"    The papists quote the words of Christ: \"If thou wilt enter into life,  keep the commandments.\" (Matt. 19:17.) With His own words they deny  Christ and abolish faith in Him. Christ is made to lose His good  name, His office, and His glory, and is demoted to the status of a law  enforcer, reproving, terrifying, and chasing poor sinners around.    The proper office of Christ is to raise the sinner, and extricate him  from his sins.    Papists and Anabaptists deride us because we so earnestly require faith.  \"Faith,\" they say, \"makes men reckless.\" What do these law-workers know  about faith, when they are so busy calling people back from baptism,  from faith, from the promises of Christ to the Law?    With their doctrine these lying sects of perdition deface the benefits  of Christ to this day. They rob Christ of His glory as the Justifier of  mankind and cast Him into the role of a minister of sin. They are like  the false apostles. There is not a single one among them who knows the  difference between law and grace.    We can tell the difference. We do not here and now argue whether we  ought to do good works, or whether the Law is any good, or whether the  Law ought to be kept at all. We will discuss these questions some other  time. We are now concerned with justification. Our opponents refuse  to make this distinction. All they can do is to bellow that good works  ought to be done. We know that. We know that good works ought to be  done, but we will talk about that when the proper time comes. Now we are  dealing with justification, and here good works should not be so much as  mentioned.    Paul's argument has often comforted me. He argues: \"If we who have been  justified by Christ are counted unrighteous, why seek justification in  Christ at all? If we are justified by the Law, tell me, what has Christ  achieved by His death, by His preaching, by His victory over sin and  death? Either we are justified by Christ, or we are made worse sinners  by Him.\"    The Sacred Scriptures, particularly those of the New Testament, make  frequent mention of faith in Christ. \"Whosoever believeth in him is  saved, shall not perish, shall have everlasting life, is not judged,\"  etc. In open contradiction to the Scriptures, our opponents misquote,  \"He that believeth in Christ is condemned, because he has faith without  works.\" Our opponents turn everything topsy-turvy. They make Christ  over into a murderer, and Moses into a savior. Is not this horrible  blasphemy?        VERSE 17. Is therefore Christ the minister of sin?    This is Hebrew phraseology, also used by Paul in II Corinthians, chapter  3. There Paul speaks of two ministers: The minister of the letter, and  the minister of the spirit; the minister of the Law, and the minister  of grace; the minister of death, and the minister of life. \"Moses,\"  says Paul, \"is the minister of the Law, of sin, wrath, death, and  condemnation.\"    Whoever teaches that good works are indispensable unto salvation, that  to gain heaven a person must suffer afflictions and follow the example  of Christ and of the saints, is a minister of the Law, of sin, wrath,  and of death, for the conscience knows how impossible it is for a person  to fulfill the Law. Why, the Law makes trouble even for those who have  the Holy Spirit. What will not the Law do in the case of the wicked who  do not even have the Holy Spirit?    The Law requires perfect obedience. It condemns all who do not  accomplish the will of God. But show me a person who is able to render  perfect obedience. The Law cannot justify. It can only condemn according  to the passage: \"Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things  which are written in the book of the law to do them.\"    Paul has good reason for calling the minister of the Law the minister of  sin, for the Law reveals our sinfulness. The realization of sin in turn  frightens the heart and drives it to despair. Therefore all exponents of  the Law and of works deserve to be called tyrants and oppressors.    The purpose of the Law is to reveal sin. That this is the purpose of the  Law can be seen from the account of the giving of the Law as reported  in the nineteenth and twentieth chapters of Exodus. Moses brought the  people out of their tents to have God speak to them personally from a  cloud. But the people trembled with fear, fled, and standing aloof they  begged Moses: \"Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God  speak with us, lest we die.\" The proper office of the Law is to lead us  out of our tents, in other words, out of the security of our self-trust,  into the presence of God, that we may perceive His anger at our  sinfulness.    All who say that faith alone in Christ does not justify a person,  convert Christ into a minister of sin, a teacher of the Law, and a cruel  tyrant who requires the impossible. All merit-seekers take Christ for a  new lawgiver.    In conclusion, if the Law is the minister of sin, it is at the same  time the minister of wrath and death. As the Law reveals sin it fills  a person with the fear of death and condemnation. Eventually the  conscience wakes up to the fact that God is angry. If God is angry  with you, He will destroy and condemn you forever. Unable to stand the  thought of the wrath and judgment of God, many a person commits suicide.        VERSE 17. God forbid.    Christ is not the minister of sin, but the Dispenser of righteousness  and the Giver of life. Christ is Lord over law, sin and death. All who  believe in Him are delivered from law, sin and death.    The Law drives us away from God, but Christ reconciles God unto us, for  \"He is the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world.\" Now if  the sin of the world is taken away, it is taken away from me. If sin is  taken away, the wrath of God and His condemnation are also taken away.  Let us practice this blessed conviction.        VERSE 18. For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make    myself a transgressor.    \"I have not preached to the end that I build again the things which I  destroyed. If I should do so, I would not only be laboring in vain,  but I would make myself guilty of a great wrong. By the ministry of the  Gospel I have destroyed sin, heaviness of heart, wrath, and death. I  have abolished the Law, so that it should not bother your conscience any  more. Should I now once again establish the Law, and set up the rule  of Moses? This is exactly what I should be doing, if I would urge  circumcision and the performance of the Law as necessary unto salvation.  Instead of righteousness and life, I would restore sin and death.\"    By the grace of God we know that we are justified through faith in  Christ alone. We do not mingle law and grace, faith and works. We keep  them far apart. Let every true Christian mark the distinction between  law and grace, and mark it well.    We must not drag good works into the article of justification as the  monks do who maintain that not only good works, but also the punishment  which evildoers suffer for their wicked deeds, deserve everlasting life.  When a criminal is brought to the place of execution, the monks"]]]
