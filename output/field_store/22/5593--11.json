From the above explanation of this important adhikara/n/a the one given  in the Sri-bhashya differs totally. According to Ramanuja the  adhikara/n/a raises the question whether the imperfections clinging to  the individual soul (the discussion of which has now come to an end)  affect also the highest Lord who, according to Scripture, abides within  the soul as antaryamin. 'Notwithstanding the abode (of the highest Self  within the soul) (it is) not (affected by the soul's imperfections)  because everywhere (the highest Self is represented) as having twofold  characteristics (viz. being, on one hand, free from all evil,  apahatapapman, vijara, vim/ri/tyu, &c., and, on the other hand, endowed  with all auspicious qualities, satyakama, satyasa/m/kalpa, &c.)  (11).--Should it be objected that, just as the soul although essentially  free from evil--according to the Prajapativakya in the Chandogya--yet is  liable to imperfections owing to its connexion with a variety of bodies,  so the antaryamin also is affected by abiding within bodies; we deny  this because in every section of the chapter referring to the antaryamin  (in the B/ri/hadara/n/yaka) he is expressly called the Immortal, the  ruler within; which shows him to be free from the shortcomings of the  jiva (12).--Some, moreover, expressly assert that, although the Lord and  the soul are within one body, the soul only is imperfect, not the Lord  (dva supar/n/a sayuja sakhaya) (13).--Should it be said that, according  to the Chandogya, Brahman entered together with the souls into the  elements previously to the evolution of names and forms, and hence  participates in the latter, thus becoming implicated in the sa/m/sara;  we reply that Brahman, although connected with such and such forms, is  in itself devoid of form, since it is the principal element (agent;  pradhana) in the bringing about of names and forms (according to  'aka/s/o ha vai namarupayor nirvahita') (14).--But does not the passage  'satya/m/ j/n/anam anantam brahma' teach that Brahman is nothing but  light (intelligence) without any difference, and does not the passage  'neti neti' deny of it all qualities?--As in order, we reply, not to  deprive passages as the one quoted from the Taittiriya of their purport,  we admit that Brahman's nature is light, so we must also admit that  Brahman is satyasa/m/kalpa, and so on; for if not, the passages in which  those qualities are asserted would become purportless (15).--Moreover  the Taittiriya passage only asserts so much, viz. the praka/s/arupata of  Brahman, and does not deny other qualities (l6).--And the passage 'neti  neti' will be discussed later on.--The ubhayali@ngatva of Brahman in the  sense assigned above is asserted in many places /S/ruti and Sm/ri/ti  (17).--Because Brahman although abiding in many places is not touched by  their imperfections, the similes of the reflected sun, of the ether  limited by jars, &c., are applicable to it (18).--Should it be said that  the illustration is not an appropriate one, because the sun is  apprehended in the water erroneously only while the antaryamin really  abides within all things, and therefore must be viewed as sharing their  defects (19); we reply that what the simile means to negative is merely  that Brahman should, owing to its inherence in many places, participate  in the increase, decrease, and so on, of its abodes. On this view both  similes are appropriate (20).--Analogous similes we observe to be  employed in ordinary life, as when we compare a man to a lion (21).    Sutras 22-30 constitute, according to /S/a@nkara, a new adhikara/n/a  (VI), whose object it is to show that the clause 'not so, not so' (neti  neti; B/ri/hadar) negatives, not Brahman itself, but only the two forms  of Brahman described in the preceding part of the chapter. Sutras 23-26  further dwell on Brahman being in reality devoid of all distinctive  attributes which are altogether due to the upadhis. The last four Sutras  return to the question how, Brahman being one only, the souls are in so  many places spoken of as different from it, and, two explanatory  hypotheses having been rejected, the conclusion is arrived at that all  difference is unreal, due to fictitious limiting adjuncts.    According to Ramanuja, Sutras 22 ff. continue the discussion started in  Sutra 11. How, the question is asked, can the ubhayali@ngatva of Brahman  be maintained considering that the 'not so, not so' of the  B/ri/hadara/n/yaka denies of Brahman all the previously mentioned modes  (prakara), so that it can only be called that which is (sanmatra)?--The  reply given in Sutra 22 is that 'not so, not so' does not deny of  Brahman the distinctive qualities or modes declared previously (for it  would be senseless at first to teach them, and finally to deny them  again[16]), but merely denies the prak/ri/taitavattva, the previously  stated limited nature of Brahman, i.e. it denies that Brahman possesses  only the previously mentioned qualifications. With this agrees, that  subsequently to 'neti neti' Scripture itself enunciates further  qualifications of Brahman. That Brahman as stated above is not the  object of any other means of proof but Scripture is confirmed in Sutra  23, 'Scripture declares Brahman to be the non-manifest.'--And the  intuition (sakshatkkara) of Brahman ensues only upon its sa/m/radhana,  i.e. upon its being perfectly pleased by the worshipper's devotion, as  Scripture and Sm/ri/ti declare (24).--That this interpretation of 'neti'  is the right one, is likewise shown by the fact that in the same way as  praka/s/a, luminousness, j/n/ana, intelligence, &c., so also the quality  of being differentiated by the world (prapa/nk/avsish/t/ata) is intuited  as non-different, i.e. as likewise qualifying Brahman; and that  praka/s/a, and so on, characterise Brahman, is known through repeated  practice (on the part of /ri/shis like Vamadeva) in the work of  sa/m/radhana mentioned before (25).--For all these reasons Brahman is  connected with the infinite, i.e. the infinite number of auspicious  qualities; for thus the twofold indications (li@nga) met with in  Scripture are fully justified (26).--In what relation, then, does the  a/k/id vastu, i.e. the non-sentient matter, which, according to the  b/ri/hadara/n/yaka, is one of the forms of Brahman, stand to the  latter?--Non-sentient beings might, in the first place, be viewed as  special arrangements (sa/m/sthanavisesha/h/) of Brahman, as the coils  are of the body of the snake; for Brahman is designated as both, i.e.  sometimes as one with the world (Brahman is all this, &c.), sometimes as  different from it (Let me enter into those elements, &c.) (27).--Or, in  the second place, the relation of the two might be viewed as analogous  to that of light and the luminous object which are two and yet one, both  being fire (28).--Or, in the third place, the relation is like that  stated before, i.e. the material world is, like the individual souls  (whose case was discussed in II, 3, 43), a part--a/ms/a--of Brahman (29,  30).    Adhik. VII (31-37) explains how some metaphorical expressions, seemingly  implying that there is something different from Brahman, have to be  truly understood.    Adhik. VIII (38-41) teaches that the reward of works is not, as Jaimini  opines, the independent result of the works acting through the so-called  apurva, but is allotted by the Lord.      PADA III.      With the third pada of the second adhyaya a new section of the work  begins, whose task it is to describe how the individual soul is enabled  by meditation on Brahman to obtain final release. The first point to be  determined here is what constitutes a meditation on Brahman, and, more  particularly, in what relation those parts of the Upanishads stand to  each other which enjoin identical or partly identical meditations. The  reader of the Upanishads cannot fail to observe that the texts of the  different /s/akhas contain many chapters of similar, often nearly  identical, contents, and that in some cases the text of even one and the  same /s/akha exhibits the same matter in more or less varied forms. The  reason of this clearly is that the common stock of religious and  philosophical ideas which were in circulation at the time of the  composition of the Upanishads found separate expression in the different  priestly communities; hence the same speculations, legends, &c. reappear  in various places of the sacred Scriptures in more or less differing  dress. Originally, when we may suppose the members of each Vedic school  to have confined themselves to the study of their own sacred texts, the  fact that the texts of other schools contained chapters of similar  contents would hardly appear to call for special note or comment; not  any more than the circumstance that the sacrificial performances  enjoined on the followers of some particular /s/akha were found  described with greater or smaller modifications in the books of other  /s/akhas also. But already at a very early period, at any rate long  before the composition of the Vedanta-sutras in their present form, the  Vedic theologians must have apprehended the truth that, in whatever  regards sacrificial acts, one /s/akha may indeed safely follow its own  texts, disregarding the texts of all other /s/akhas; that, however, all  texts which aim at throwing light on the nature of Brahman and the  relation to it of the human soul must somehow or other be combined into  one consistent systematical whole equally valid for the followers of all  Vedic schools. For, as we have had occasion"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16331"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War from the Beginning to March (#13)"],[1,"to M. Sazonof, who continued to urge England to unconditionally  join Russia and France:         I added that you [Grey] could not promise to do anything more, and       that his Excellency was mistaken if he believed that the cause of       peace could be promoted by our telling the German Government that       they would have to deal with us as well as with Russia and France       if she supported Austria by force of arms. Their [the German]       attitude would merely be stiffened by such a menace.--(British       \"White Paper\" No. 44.)    But on this same 27th day of July, Grey, submitting to the intrigues of  Russian and French diplomacy, had committed one very fateful step  (Telegram to Buchanan, July 27):         I have been told by the Russian Ambassador that in German and       Austrian circles impression prevails that in any event we would       stand aside. His Excellency deplored the effect that such an       impression must produce. This impression ought, as I have pointed       out, to be dispelled by the orders we have given to the first fleet       which is concentrated, as it happens, at Portland not to disperse       for manoeuvre leave. But I explained to the Russian Ambassador that       my reference to it must not be taken to mean that anything more       than diplomatic action was promised.--(British \"White Paper\" No.       47.)    For Russia this order to the fleet meant very much more than a  diplomatic action. Sazonof saw that the wind in London was turning in  his favor and he made use of it. Among themselves the Russian  diplomatists seem to have for a long time been clear and open in their  discussion of their real object. You find among the documents of the  Russian \"Orange Book\" the following telegram of Sazonof of July 25 to  the Russian Ambassador in London:         In case of a new aggravation of the situation, possibly provoking       on the part of the great powers' united action, [des actions       conformes,] we count that England will not delay placing herself       clearly on the side of Russia and France, with the view to       maintaining the equilibrium of Europe, in favor of which she has       constantly intervened in the past, and which would without doubt be       compromised in the case of the triumph of Austria.--(Russian       \"Orange Paper\" No. 17.)    There is no mention of Servia here, but Austria should not triumph.  Russia's real intention, of course, was not placed so nakedly before the  British Secretary of State, hence to him the appearance was maintained  that the little State of the Sawe was the only consideration, although  the Russian Army was already being mobilized with all energy.    On the 28th he wires to the Russian Ambassador, Count Benckendorff, to  London to inform the British Government:         It seems to me that England is in a better position than any other       power to make another attempt at Berlin to induce the German       Government to take the necessary action. There is no doubt       that the key of the situation is to be found at Berlin.--(British       \"White Paper\" No. 54.)    The opinion subtly suggested upon him by Paris and Petersburg diplomacy,  namely, that he should not use any pressure upon Russia, but upon  Germany, now takes hold of Grey more and more. On July 29 he writes to  the German Ambassador as follows:         In fact, mediation was ready to come into operation by any method       that Germany thought possible if only Germany would \"press the       button in the interests of peace.\"--(British \"White Paper\" No. 84.)    Petersburg, now assured of the support of Grey, becomes more and more  outspoken for war. On the 28th Grey again expressed one of his  softhearted propositions for peace. Mr. Sazonof hardly made the effort  to hide his contempt. Buchanan telegraphs on the 29th as follows:         The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that proposal referred to in       your telegram of the 28th inst. was one of secondary importance.       Under altered circumstances of situation he did not attach weight       to it.... Minister for Foreign Affairs had given me to understand       that Russia would not precipitate war by crossing frontier       immediately, and a week or more would in any case elapse before       mobilization was completed. In order to find an issue out of a       dangerous situation it was necessary that we should in the       meanwhile all work together.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 78.)    Naivete or Cynicism?    Here it really becomes impossible to judge where the naivete of the  British Secretary of State ends and cynicism begins, for Sazonof could  not have told to him more plainly than in these lines that all Russia's  ostensible readiness for peace served no other purpose than to win time  to complete the strategical location of the Russian troops.    This point is emphasized by one document coming from a writer presumably  unbiased, but presumably distrustful of Germany, wherein the  confirmation is found that England and Russia had come to a full  agreement during these days.    On July 30 the Belgian Charge d'Affaires de l'Escaille in Petersburg  reported to the Belgian Government upon the European crisis. Owing to  the fast developing events of a warlike nature, this letter did not  reach its address by mail, and it was published later on. The Belgian  diplomatist writes:         It is undeniable that Germany tried hard here [that is, in       Petersburg] and in Vienna to find any means whatsoever in order to       forestall a general conflict....    And after M. de l'Escaille has told that Russia--what the Czar and his  War Minister with their highest assurances toward Germany had  denied--was mobilizing its own army, he continues:         Today at Petersburg one is absolutely convinced, yes, they have       even received assurances in that direction, that England and France       will stay by them. This assistance is of decisive importance and       has contributed much to the victory of the [Russian] war party.    This settles Grey's pretended \"attempts at mediation.\" The truth is that  British politics decided to prevent a diplomatic success of Germany and  Austria, now worked openly toward the Russian aim. \"The exertion of  pressure upon Berlin\" included already a certain threat, mingled with  good advice.    On July 23 Grey had only spoken of four possible powers in war; hence  when on the German side some hope of England maintaining neutrality was  indulged in, this impression rested upon Grey's own explanations. On  July 29, however, after a political conversation with Prince Lichnowsky,  German Ambassador in London, he adds an important personal bit of  information. He wires concerning it to Berlin, to Goschen:         After speaking to the German Ambassador this afternoon about the       European situation, I said that I wished to say to him, in a quite       private and friendly way, something that was on my mind. The       situation was very grave.... But if we failed in our efforts to       keep the peace, and if the issue spread so that it involved every       European interest, I did not wish to be open to any reproach from       him, that the friendly tone of all our conversations had misled him       or his Government into supposing that we should not take action....       But we knew very well that if the issue did become such that we       thought that British interests required us to intervene, we must       intervene at once and the decision would have to be very       rapid.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 89.)    But what is especially wrong is that Grey brought this warning,  which only could have any effect if it remained an absolute,  confidential secret between the English and German Governments, also to  the French Ambassador, so that the entire Entente could mischievously  look on and see whether Germany really would give in to British  pressure. Of course, in his manner of swaying to and fro, he did not  wish either that Cambon should not accept this information to the German  Ambassador as a decided taking of a position on the part of England:         I thought it necessary [speaking to M. Cambon] to say that because       as he knew we were taking all precautions with regard to our fleet       and I was about to warn Prince Lichnowsky not to count on our       standing aside, but it would not be fair that I should let M.       Cambon be misled into supposing that we had decided what to do in a       contingency that I still hoped might not arise....--(British \"White       Paper\" No. 87.)    Stirring Up Trouble.    On the German side Grey's open threat, which was presented, however,  with smooth and friendly sounding words, was received with quiet  politeness. Goschen telegraphed on the 30th concerning a talk with State  Secretary von Jagow:         His Excellency added that telegram received from Prince Lichnowsky       last night contains matter which he had heard with regret, but not       exactly with surprise, and, at all events, he thoroughly       appreciated the frankness and loyalty with which you had       spoken.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 98.)    Now the work of stirring up trouble is continued unceasingly. On July 30  the British Ambassador in Paris, Sir F. Bertie, concerning a  conversation with the President of the Republic, reports:         He [Poincare] is convinced that peace between the powers is in the       hands of Great Britain. If his Majesty's Government announced that       England would come to the aid of France in the event of a conflict       between France and Germany ... there would be no war, for Germany       would at once modify her attitude.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 99.)    Did Grey really think for one moment that the German Empire would  change its position immediately, in other words, would suddenly leave  its ally in need, or is all this only a mass of diplomatic  blandishments?
