A rain god presided over the  destinies of one community, and a god of disease and death over  another; a third exalted the war god, no doubt because raids were  frequent and the city owed its strength and prosperity to its battles  and conquests. The reputation won by a particular god throughout  Babylonia would depend greatly on the achievements of his worshippers  and the progress of the city civilization over which he presided.  Bel-Enlil's fame as a war deity was probably due to the political  supremacy of his city of Nippur; and there was probably good reason  for attributing to the sun god a pronounced administrative and legal  character; he may have controlled the destinies of exceedingly well  organized communities in which law and order and authority were held  in high esteem.    In accounting for the rise of distinctive and rival city deities, we  should also consider the influence of divergent conceptions regarding  the origin of life in mingled communities. Each foreign element in a  community had its own intellectual life and immemorial tribal  traditions, which reflected ancient habits of life and perpetuated the  doctrines of eponymous ancestors. Among the agricultural classes, the  folk religion which entered so intimately into their customs and  labours must have remained essentially Babylonish in character. In  cities, however, where official religions were formulated, foreign  ideas were more apt to be imposed, especially when embraced by  influential teachers. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that in  Babylonia, as in Egypt, there were differences of opinion regarding  the origin of life and the particular natural element which  represented the vital principle.    One section of the people, who were represented by the worshippers of  Ea, appear to have believed that the essence of life was contained in  water. The god of Eridu was the source of the \"water of life\". He  fertilized parched and sunburnt wastes through rivers and irrigating  canals, and conferred upon man the sustaining \"food of life\". When  life came to an end--        Food of death will be offered thee...      Water of death will be offered thee...    Offerings of water and food were made to the dead so that the ghosts  might be nourished and prevented from troubling the living. Even the  gods required water and food; they were immortal because they had  drunk ambrosia and eaten from the plant of life. When the goddess  Ishtar was in the Underworld, the land of the dead, the servant of Ea  exclaimed--        \"Hail! lady, may the well give me of its waters, so that I may          drink.\"    The goddess of the dead commanded her servant to \"sprinkle the lady  Ishtar with the water of life and bid her depart\". The sacred water  might also be found at a confluence of rivers. Ea bade his son,  Merodach, to \"draw water from the mouth of two streams\", and \"on this  water to put his pure spell\".    The worship of rivers and wells which prevailed in many countries was  connected with the belief that the principle of life was in moisture.  In India, water was vitalized by the intoxicating juice of the Soma  plant, which inspired priests to utter prophecies and filled their  hearts with religious fervour. Drinking customs had originally a  religious significance. It was believed in India that the sap of  plants was influenced by the moon, the source of vitalizing moisture  and the hiding-place of the mead of the gods. The Teutonic gods also  drank this mead, and poets were inspired by it. Similar beliefs  obtained among various peoples. Moon and water worship were therefore  closely associated; the blood of animals and the sap of plants were  vitalized by the water of life and under control of the moon.    The body moisture of gods and demons had vitalizing properties. When  the Indian creator, Prajapati, wept at the beginning, \"that (the  tears) which fell into the water became the air. That which he wiped  away, upwards, became the sky.\"[50] The ancient Egyptians believed  that all men were born from the eyes of Horus except negroes, who came  from other parts of his body.[51] The creative tears of Ra, the sun  god, fell as shining rays upon the earth. When this god grew old  saliva dripped from his mouth, and Isis mixed the vitalizing moisture  with dust, and thus made the serpent which bit and paralysed the great  solar deity.[52]    Other Egyptian deities, including Osiris and Isis, wept creative  tears. Those which fell from the eyes of the evil gods produced  poisonous plants and various baneful animals. Orion, the Greek giant,  sprang from the body moisture of deities. The weeping ceremonies in  connection with agricultural rites were no doubt believed to be of  magical potency; they encouraged the god to weep creative tears.    Ea, the god of the deep, was also \"lord of life\" (Enti), \"king of the  river\" (Lugal-ida), and god of creation (Nudimmud). His aid was  invoked by means of magical formulae. As the \"great magician of the  gods\" he uttered charms himself, and was the patron of all magicians.  One spell runs as follows:        I am the sorcerer priest of Ea...      To revive the ... sick man      The great lord Ea hath sent me;      He hath added his pure spell to mine,      He hath added his pure voice to mine,      He hath added his pure spittle to mine.                _R.C. Thompson's Translation._    Saliva, like tears, had creative and therefore curative qualities; it  also expelled and injured demons and brought good luck. Spitting  ceremonies are referred to in the religious literature of Ancient  Egypt. When the Eye of Ra was blinded by Set, Thoth spat in it to  restore vision. The sun god Tum, who was linked with Ra as Ra-Tum,  spat on the ground, and his saliva became the gods Shu and Tefnut. In  the Underworld the devil serpent Apep was spat upon to curse it, as  was also its waxen image which the priests fashioned.[53]    Several African tribes spit to make compacts, declare friendship, and  to curse.    Park, the explorer, refers in his _Travels_ to his carriers spitting  on a flat stone to ensure a good journey. Arabian holy men and  descendants of Mohammed spit to cure diseases. Mohammed spat in the  mouth of his grandson Hasen soon after birth. Theocritus, Sophocles,  and Plutarch testify to the ancient Grecian customs of spitting to  cure and to curse, and also to bless when children were named. Pliny  has expressed belief in the efficacy of the fasting spittle for curing  disease, and referred to the custom of spitting to avert witchcraft.  In England, Scotland, and Ireland spitting customs are not yet  obsolete. North of England boys used to talk of \"spitting their sauls\"  (souls). When the Newcastle colliers held their earliest strikes they  made compacts by spitting on a stone. There are still \"spitting  stones\" in the north of Scotland. When bargains are made in rural  districts, hands are spat upon before they are shaken. The first money  taken each day by fishwives and other dealers is spat upon to ensure  increased drawings. Brand, who refers to various spitting customs,  quotes _Scot's Discovery of Witchcraft_ regarding the saliva cure for  king's evil, which is still, by the way, practised in the Hebrides.  Like Pliny, Scot recommended ceremonial spitting as a charm against  witchcraft.[54] In China spitting to expel demons is a common  practice. We still call a hasty person a \"spitfire\", and a calumniator  a \"spit-poison\".    The life principle in trees, &c., as we have seen, was believed to  have been derived from the tears of deities. In India sap was called  the \"blood of trees\", and references to \"bleeding trees\" are still  widespread and common. \"Among the ancients\", wrote Professor Robertson  Smith, \"blood is generally conceived as the principle or vehicle of  life, and so the account often given of sacred waters is that the  blood of the deity flows in them. Thus as Milton writes:        Smooth Adonis from his native rock      Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood      Of Thammuz yearly wounded.                _Paradise Lost_, i, 450.    The ruddy colour which the swollen river derived from the soil at a  certain season was ascribed to the blood of the god, who received his  death wound in Lebanon at that time of the year, and lay buried beside  the sacred source.\"[55]    In Babylonia the river was regarded as the source of the life blood  and the seat of the soul. No doubt this theory was based on the fact  that the human liver contains about a sixth of the blood in the body,  the largest proportion required by any single organ. Jeremiah makes  \"Mother Jerusalem\" exclaim: \"My liver is poured upon the earth for the  destruction of the daughter of my people\", meaning that her life is  spent with grief.    Inspiration was derived by drinking blood as well as by drinking  intoxicating liquors--the mead of the gods. Indian magicians who drink  the blood of the goat sacrificed to the goddess Kali, are believed to  be temporarily possessed by her spirit, and thus enabled to  prophesy.[56] Malayan exorcists still expel demons while they suck the  blood from a decapitated fowl.[57]    Similar customs were prevalent in Ancient Greece. A woman who drank  the blood of a sacrificed lamb or bull uttered prophetic sayings.[58]    But while most Babylonians appear to have believed that the life  principle was in blood, some were apparently of opinion that it was in  breath--the air of life. A man died when he ceased to breathe; his  spirit, therefore, it was argued, was identical with the  atmosphere--the moving wind--and was accordingly derived from the  atmospheric or wind god. When, in the Gilgamesh epic, the hero invokes  the dead Ea-bani, the ghost rises up like a \"breath of wind\". A  Babylonian charm runs:        The gods which seize on men        Came forth from the grave;      The evil wind gusts        Have come forth from the grave,      To demand payment"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16658"],[0,"Piano and Song (#13)"],[1,"of delivery, by which the voice has been destroyed,  even before it has attained its full development. The consideration of  this fact induces me to communicate some portions from my journal, and  to unite with them a few opinions of the noted singing-master, Teschner,  of Berlin.           *       *       *       *       *    Must we again and again explain to German composers that, though we do  not require them to compose in Italian, they ought, at least, to learn  to write in German in a manner suited for singing? otherwise, in their  amazing ignorance and infatuation, they will wear out the powers of  opera singers, and torture the public, apparently without a suspicion  that it is possible to write both grand and light operas with true,  characteristic German thoroughness. Even German opera requires a  constant attention to the right use of the voice, and a methodical,  effective mode of singing. It tolerates no murderous attacks on single  male and female voices, or on the full opera company; it is opposed to  that eager searching after superficial effect, which every sincere  friend of the opera must lament.    Is it, then, so difficult to obtain the requisite knowledge of the human  voice, and to study the scores of Gluck, Haydn, Mozart, Rossini,  Bellini, and Donizetti with a special regard to this? Do our vocal  composers make too great a sacrifice to their creative genius in making  a study of those things which are essential? You consider it mortifying  to inquire of those who understand singing, and you are sensitive about  any disturbance of your vain over-estimate of your own powers; but you  are not ashamed to cause the destruction of man's noblest gift,--the  human voice! If taste, feeling, and a fine ear are, and always must be,  the chief requirements in composing for the great public, I ask you how  you can lay claim to these three trifles, when you constantly violate  them?    COMPOSER. If Mrs. N. had executed my aria to-day in as earnest and  masterly a style, and with as agreeable a voice, as she did that of  Rossini yesterday, she would have given as much satisfaction; for it is  much more interesting and expressive both musically and harmonically,  and written with more dramatic effect.    SINGER. You make a mistake, and you always will do so, as long as you  consider the study of the voice as of secondary importance, or, in fact,  pay no attention whatever to it. The latter aria, which is composed with  a regard to the voice, and to the employment of its most agreeable  tones, puts me into a comfortable mood, and gives me a feeling of  success; yours, on the contrary, into one of dissatisfaction and  anticipation of failure. Of what importance is the musical value of a  composition, if it can only be sung with doubtful success, and if the  voice is obliged to struggle with it, instead of having it under  control? You attach less importance to the free, agreeable exercise of  the voice than does the unanimous public. I do not wish to excite  compassion, but to give pleasure by a beautifully developed style of  singing. You pay some attention to adaptability to the piano or the  violin: why are you usually regardless of fitness for the voice?    Critics have often asked, Why does Jenny Lind sing so coolly? why does  she not sing grand, passionate parts? why does she not select for her  performances some of the later German or even Italian operas? why does  she always sing Amina, Lucia, Norma, Susanna, &c.? In reply to these and  similar questions, I will ask, Why does she wish always to remain Jenny  Lind? why does she endeavor to preserve her voice as long as possible?  why does she select operas in which she may use her pure, artistic,  refined mode of singing, which permits no mannerism, no hypocritical  sentiment, and which possesses an ideal beauty? why does she choose  operas in which she can give the most perfect possible image of her own  personality? why operas in which she may allow the marvellous union of  her powers of song to shine conspicuously, without doing violence to her  voice and forcing its tones, or casting doubt upon her lofty, noble, and  beautiful art? why does she first regard the singing, and only  afterwards the music, or both united? This is the answer to the same  questions which are likewise asked about Henrietta Sontag and all great  singers. Even the passionate Schroeder-Devrient seldom made an exception  to this rule, although she was not independent of the theatres.    These questions should be an urgent warning to our young female singers  not to sacrifice themselves to any of the modern screaming operas,  unsuited for singing; but to preserve and watch over their voices, and  to guard them from immoderate, continued, and often inartistic exertion;  in fact, to sing always in the voice-register with which nature has  endowed them, and never to shriek; to renounce the present, fashionable,  so-called \"singing effects,\" and the modern scene-screaming, as Jenny  Lind and Henrietta Sontag have always done. Then their voices would  remain useful for the opera, as was formerly the case, from ten to  twenty years; and they would not have to mourn, as is too common, after  a very short time, a feeble, broken voice and departed health.    Let Jenny Lind and Henrietta Sontag be placed as the finest models  before our young, gifted, ambitious singers. They are to be regarded as  miraculous phenomena; especially in our times, when the modern style of  singing has, for reasons difficult to justify, so widely deviated from  the old school which was so fruitful in brilliant results,--that of  Pistocchi, Porpora, and Bernacchi. What could show more clearly the  destructiveness of our present opera style than the sublime beauty of  their singing, combined with their noble, refined, sound voices, such  as may perhaps still be found among you?           *       *       *       *       *    The managers of our theatres are in want of tenor singers who can act.  They should consider that tenors who have any voices left have never  learned to act, and tenors who are able to act no longer have any  voices; because, as a rule, they either have studied too little, or have  studied erroneously. Unless the voice has received a correct and fine  culture, the German comic operas lead immediately to destruction of the  voice, especially of the sensitive, easily injured German tenor voice.    Here I take occasion to remark upon the universal prejudice, that \"a  tenor ought to develop the chest-tones as far as possible, that they are  the finest.\" In tenors, with very few exceptions, this mistaken  treatment has been speedily followed by the loss both of voice and  health. Nicely shaded singing, from _piano_ onwards, is thereby rendered  impossible; and tones which are always forced must remain unpleasant,  even although powers thus laboriously gained may sometimes have a fine  effect in the opera. A tenor who wishes to preserve his voice and not to  scream in the upper tones, who desires always to have a _piano_ at  command and to possess the necessary shading and lightness as well as  elegance and flexibility, should cultivate the _falsetto_, and endeavor  to bring it down as far as possible into the chest-register. This is as  indispensable as is the use of the head-tones for the soprano. When the  _falsetto_ has too striking a resemblance to the chest-voice, and is  even inferior to it in power, it is the result of want of perseverance  and prudence in its cultivation. It ought to be almost imperceptibly  connected with the chest-register by the introduction of the mixed  tones.           *       *       *       *       *    We shall probably soon be called upon to read an \"Address of Young  Female Singers to the Composers of Germany,\" as follows: \"Freedom of  thought! freedom in composition! freedom in the opera! but no  annihilation of the throat! You are hereby notified that we protest  against all operas which are repugnant to the true art of singing; for  it is not in your power to compensate us for the loss of our voices,  although it may be possible for you, after using up our talent as  quickly as possible, to look around for others, with whom you can do the  same. First learn to understand singing, or, rather, first learn to  sing, as your predecessors have done, and as Italian composers still do,  and then we will talk with you again.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"What a pedantic outcry about German want of adaptability for singing!  Pray where is there the most singing?\" It is, I agree, in Germany. \"Is  not singing taught in the public schools? And consider, too, the  innumerable singing clubs, singing societies, and singing institutions!\"    That is just the misfortune which requires a thorough investigation. How  many promising voices do these institutions annually follow to the  grave? Who is it who sing in the schools? Boys and girls from thirteen  to fifteen years old. But boys ought not to be allowed to sing while the  voice is changing; and girls, also from physical reasons, ought not to  sing at all at that age. And what kind of instructors teach singing  here? Our epistolary and over-wise age overwhelms our superintendents  and corporations with innumerable petitions and proposals; but no true  friend of humanity, of music, and of singing, has yet been found to  enlighten these authorities, and to prove to them that the most  beautiful voices and finest talents are killed in the germ by these  unsuitable so-called singing-lessons, especially in the public schools.  Girls' voices may be carefully awakened, and skilfully practised, and  made flexible and musical; but they should be used only in _mezzo-voce_,  and only until the period of their development, or up to the thirteenth  year, or a few months sooner or later. This ought also to be done with  great experience, delicacy, practical knowledge and circumspection. But  where are we "]]]
