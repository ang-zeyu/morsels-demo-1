This may then be used for  shortening, or pan broiling for meat or fish dishes, and not have the  characteristic taste of the stronger fats.    When rendering strong mutton, duck or goose fats if a small whole  onion is added the strong flavor of the fat is reduced. Remove the  onion before straining. It may be used in cooking.      TO CLARIFY FAT    Melt the fat in an equal volume of water and heat for a short time at  a moderate temperature. Stir occasionally. Cool and remove the layer  of fat which forms on the top, scraping off any bits of meat or other  material which may adhere to the other side.    Fats which have formed on top of soups, of cooked meats (such as pot  roast, stews), salt meats (such as corned beef, ham, etc.), or strong  fats, such as from boiled mutton, poultry and game, may be clarified  in this way and used alone or combined with other animal or vegetable  fats in any savory dish.      CARE OF FAT AFTER BEING USED FOR COOKING    If fat is used for deep fat frying as croquettes, doughnuts, fritters,  etc., while fat is still hot, add a few slices raw potato and allow it  to stay in the fat until it is cool. Remove potato--strain fat, allow  to harden and it is ready to use. The potato absorbs odors from fat.      HOW TO MAKE SAVORY FATS    FAT 1: To 1 pound of unrendered fat (chopped fine) add 1 slice of  onion about one-half inch thick and two inches in diameter, 1 bay  leaf, 1 teaspoonful salt, and about one-eighth teaspoonful of pepper.  Render in a double boiler and strain.    FAT 2: To 1 pound unrendered fat (chopped fine) add 2 teaspoonfuls  of thyme, 1 slice onion, about one-half inch thick and two inches  in diameter, one teaspoonful salt and about one-eighth teaspoonful  pepper. Render in a double boiler and strain.    FAT 3: To 1 pound unrendered fat (chopped fine) add 1 teaspoonful  thyme, 1 teaspoonful marjoram, one-half teaspoonful rubbed sage, 1  teaspoonful salt, and about one-eighth teaspoonful pepper. Render in a  double boiler and strain through fine cloth.      EXTENSION OF TABLE FATS      A. Butter or other fat may be extended to double its original bulk and  reduce the cost of the fat 40 per cent. A patented churn, any homemade  churn, mayonnaise mixer, or bowl and rotary beater may be used for  the purpose. To any quantity of butter heated until slightly soft add  equal quantity of milk, place in the churn, add one teaspoon salt for  each one pound of butter used. Blend thoroughly in churn, mayonnaise  mixer, or in bowl with rotary beater until of even consistency. Place  in refrigerator to harden. Vegetable coloring, such as comes with  margarine or may be purchased separately, may be added if a deeper  yellow color is desired.      B.      1 lb. butter    1 quart milk (2 pint bottles preferred)    1 tablespoon granulated gelatine    1-1/2 teaspoons salt    Soak gelatine in one-half cup of the milk. When softened, dissolve  over hot water. Let butter stand in warm place, until soft. Add  gelatine mixture, milk and salt and beat with Dover beater until  thoroughly mixed (about 15 minutes). Vegetable coloring such as comes  with margarine may be added if desired. Do not put on ice.      C.      1 lb. butter    1 quart milk (2 pint bottles preferred)    1 tablespoon granulated gelatine    1-1/2 teaspoons salt    1 cup peanut butter    Soak gelatine in one-half cup of the milk. When softened, dissolve  over hot water. Let butter stand in warm place, until soft. Add  gelatine mixture, peanut butter, milk and salt and beat with rotary  egg beater until thoroughly blended (about 15 minutes). Vegetable  coloring such as comes with margarine may be added if desired. Put in  cool place to harden but do not put on ice as the gelatine would cause  the mixture to flake. It is preferable to make up this mixture enough  for one day at a time only.      D. To 1 pound of butter or butter substitute add one cup peanut  butter. Blend thoroughly with wooden spoon or butter paddle; this may  be used in place of butter as a new and delightful variation.      E. To 1 pound softened butter add 1 pound softened butter substitute  (oleomargarine, nut margarine, vegetable margarine) or hydrogenated  fat. Blend thoroughly with butter paddle or wooden spoon and use as  butter.          SUGGESTIONS FOR PASTRY    Whole wheat makes a more tasty crust than bread flour and all rye  pastry has even better flavor than wheat flour pastry. Half wheat or  rye and the other half cornmeal (white or yellow) makes an excellent  pastry for meat or fish pie. If cornmeal is added, use this recipe:      CORNMEAL PASTRY FOR MEAT OR FISH      1/2 cup cornmeal    1/2 cup rye or wheat flour    2 tablespoons fat    1/3 cup cold or ice water    1 teaspoon baking powder    Sift dry ingredients. Cut in fat. Add water and roll out on well  floured board.        PASTRY MADE WITH DRIPPING      Well made, digestible pastry should have a minimum of fat to make a  crisp flaky crust. It should be crisp, not brittle; firm, not crumbly.  Pastry may be made in large amounts, kept in refrigerator for several  days and used as needed. Roll out only enough for one crust at a time  as the less pastry is handled, the better.      PLAIN PASTRY      1 cup flour    1/3 cup fat    1/2 teaspoon salt    About 1/4 cup cold or ice water    Mix flour and salt. Cut in fat and add just enough cold or ice water  to make the mixture into a stiff dough. Roll out. This recipe makes  one crust.      MEAT OR FISH PIE CRUST      2 cups flour    4 teaspoons baking powder    1/3 cup any kind of dripping    1 cup meat stock or milk    1 teaspoon salt    Sift dry ingredients. Cut in fat if solid, or add if liquid. Stir in  meat stock or milk to make a soft dough. Place on top of meat or  fish with gravy in greased baking dish and bake 30 to 40 minutes in  moderately hot oven.          VARIOUS USES FOR LEFTOVER FATS      CREOLE RICE      2 tablespoons savory drippings    3 tablespoons flour    1 teaspoon salt    1/2 teaspoon cayenne    1-1/2 cups tomato juice and pulp    1 teaspoon onion juice    2 tablespoons chopped green pepper    1 tablespoon chopped olives    1 cup of rice    1 cup water    Wash rice and soak in water 30 minutes. Melt fat, add dry ingredients  and gradually the tomatoes. Stir in rice and other ingredients, also  the water in which rice was soaked. Cook slowly one-half hour or until  rice is tender.      POTATOES ESPAGNOLE      2 cups pared and sliced potatoes    2 tablespoons bacon drippings    2 tablespoons minced onion    1/2 teaspoon salt    1/4 tablespoon cayenne    1-1/2 cups boiling water    1 tablespoon chopped green pepper or pimento    Melt drippings. Add onion and cook until slightly brown. Add other  seasonings and water. Pour over potatoes. Let cook slowly in oven  until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.      DUMPLINGS      2 cups flour    1 teaspoon salt    4 teaspoons baking powder    2 tablespoons drippings    1 cup water, meat stock or milk    Sift dry ingredients. Cut in fat. Gradually add liquid to make a soft  dough. Roll out, place on greased pan and steam 20 minutes, or drop  into stew and cook covered 30 minutes. Serve at once.      POTATO SALAD      2 cups freshly cooked and diced potatoes    1/3 cup bacon drippings    1/2 teaspoon salt    2 tablespoons chopped peppers    2 tablespoons vinegar    1/8 teaspoon cayenne    Mix drippings, salt, pepper, vinegar and cayenne. Add to the potatoes  and mix thoroughly. Chill and serve. Cold cooked potatoes may be used,  but the flavor is better if mixed while potatoes are hot.      SOAP      1 can lye    6 lbs. fat (Fat for soap should be fat which is no longer useful            for culinary purposes.)    1 quart cold water    To lye add water--using enamel or agate utensil. When cool add the fat  which has been heated until liquid. Stir until of consistency of honey  (about 20 minutes). Two tablespoons ammonia or two tablespoons borax  may be added for a whiter soap. If stirred thoroughly this soap will  float.    [Illustration: The illustration shows various forms of food waste--the  discarded outside leaves of lettuce and cabbage, apple cores and  parings, stale bread and drippings.]          SAVE FOOD    _REASONS WHY OUR GOVERNMENT ASKS US NOT TO WASTE FOOD, WITH PRACTICAL  RECIPES ON THE USE OF LEFTOVERS_      Elimination of food waste is to-day a patriotic service. It is also a  most effective method of solving our food problem. This country,  like all the powers at war, will undoubtedly be called upon to face  increasing prices so long as the war continues, and waste in any form  is not only needless squandering of the family income, but failure in  devotion to a great cause.    Food waste is due to poor selection of raw materials, to careless  storage and heedless preparation, to bad cooking, to injudicious  serving, and to the overflowing garbage pail.    To select food in such a way as will eliminate waste and at the same  time insure the best possible return for money spent, the housekeeper  must purchase for nutriment rather than to please her own or the  family palate.    When eggs are sixty and seventy cents a dozen their price is out of  all proportion to their food value. Tomatoes at five or ten cents  apiece in winter do not supply sufficient nutriment to warrant their  cost, nor does capon at forty-five cents a pound nourish the body  any better than the fricassee fowl at twenty-eight cents. In order  to prevent such costly purchasing, a knowledge of food values is  necessary. The simplest and easiest way to plan food values is to  divide the common food materials into five main groups and see that  each of these groups appear in each day's menu.    GROUP 1.--FOODS DEPENDED ON FOR MINERAL MATTERS, VEGETABLE ACIDS, AND  BODY-REGULATING SUBSTANCES.    FRUITS      Apples, pears, etc.,    Berries,    Melons,    Oranges, lemons, all citrus fruits.    VEGETABLES      Salads, lettuce, celery,    Potherbs or \"greens\"    Tomatoes, squash,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15478"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War, Vol 2, No. 1, April, 1915 (#13)"],[1,"   \"God punish England, brother!--      Yea! Punish her, O Lord!\"    \"What German Lutheran pastors think of the gospel of hate that is at  present being preached throughout the Fatherland may be judged from an  article on the subject written for the Vossische Zeitung of Berlin, by  Dr. Julius Schiller of Nuernberg, who describes himself as a royal  Protestant pastor,\" says The Morning Post.    \"Before the war, the pastor writes, it was considered immoral to hate;  now, however, Germans know that they not only may, but they must hate.  Herr Lissauer's 'Hymn of Hate' against England is, he declares, a  faithful expression of the feelings cherished in the depths of the  German soul.    \"'All protests against this hate,' the pastor writes, 'fall on deaf  ears; we strike down all hands that would avert it. We cannot do  otherwise; we must hate the brood of liars. Our hate was provoked, and  the German can hate more thoroughly than any one else. A feeling that  this is the case is penetrating into England, but the fear of the German  hate is as yet hidden. There is a grain of truth in Lord Curzon's  statement that the phlegmatic temperament of his countrymen is incapable  of hating as the Germans hate.    \"'We Germans do, as a matter of fact, hate differently than the sons of  Albion. We Germans hate honorably, for our hatred is based on right and  justice. England, on the other hand, hates mendaciously, being impelled  by envy, ill-will, and jealousy. It was high time that we tore the mask  from England's face, that we finally saw England as she really is.    \"'We hate with a clean conscience, although religion seems to condemn as  unaesthetic everything that is included in the word hate.' The Pastor  concludes by asserting that 'we, who are fighting for truth and right  with clean hands and a clean conscience, must have Him on our side Who  is stronger than the strongest battalions. Hence our courage and our  confidence in a fortunate outcome of the world conflagration. The dawn  will soon appear that announces that the \"Day of Harvest\" for Germany  has broken.'\"    \"The avowal that the love of good Germans for Germany is inseparable  from hatred of other countries shows how deeply the aggressiveness of  German policy has sunk into the nation's mood,\" says The Times. \"Only  by constantly viewing their own country as in a natural state of  challenge to all others can Germans have come to absorb the view that  hatred is the normal manifestation of patriotism. It is a purely  militarist conception.    \"Hate is at bottom a slavish passion, and remote from that heroic spirit  of the warrior with which the Germans represent themselves as facing a  world in arms. The hater subjects his mind to the domination of what he  hates; he loses his independence and volition and becomes the prey of  the hated idea. At last he cannot free his mind from the obsession; and  the deliberate cultivation of hate in the conscientious German manner is  a kind of mental suicide.\"          THE GREAT HOUR.    By HERMANN SUDERMANN.          Whether, O Father in Heaven, we still put our trust in You,      Whether You are but a dream of a sacred past,      See now, we swear to You, Witness of Truth,      Not we have wanted it--      This murder, this world-ending murder--      Which now, with blood-hot sighs,      Stamps o'er the shuddering earth.      True to the earth, the bread-giving earth,      Happy and cheery in business and trade,      Peaceful we sat in the oak tree's shade,      Peaceful,      Though we were born to the sword.        Circled around us, for ever and ever,      Greed, sick with envy, and nets lifted high,      Full of inherited hatred.      Every one saw it, and every one felt      The secret venom, gushing forth,      Year after year,      Heavy and breath-bated years.      But hearts did not quiver      Nor hands draw the sword.        And then it came, the hour      Of sacred need, of pregnant Fate,      And what it brings forth, we will shape,      The brown gun in our mastering hand.        Ye mothers, what ye once have borne,        In honor or in vice,      Bring forth to every sacred shrine--        Your country's sacrifice.        Ye brides, whom future happiness,        Once kissed--it but seemed true,      Bring back to fair Germania        What she has given you.        Ye women, in silks or in linen,        Offer your husbands now.      Bid them goodbye, with your children,        With smiles and a blessing vow.        Ye all are doomed to lie sleepless,        Many a desolate night,      And dream of approaching conquests        And of your hero's might.        And dream of laurel and myrtle,        Until he shall return,      Till he, your master and shepherd,        Shall make the old joys burn.        And if he fell on the Autumn heath        And fell deep into death,      He died for Germania's greatness,        He died for Germania's breath.        The Fatherland they shall let stand,        Upon his blood-soaked loam,      And ne'er again shall they approach        Our sacred, peaceful home.    --Translated by Herman J. Mankiewicz.

HAAKON VII    King of Norway    _(Photo from Underwood & Underwood)_]          The Peace of the World    A Famous Englishman's Diagnosis of the War Disease and His Prescription  for a Permanent Cure    By H.G. Wells    (COPYRIGHT, 1915, BY THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY.)    (Copyrighted in Great Britain and Ireland.)      I.    Probably there have never been before in the whole past of mankind so  many people convinced of the dreadfulness of war, nor so large a  proportion anxious to end war, to rearrange the world's affairs so that  this huge hideousness of hardship, suffering, destruction, and killing  that still continues in Europe may never again be repeated.    The present writer is one of this great majority. He wants as far as  possible to end war altogether, and contrive things so that when any  unavoidable outbreak does occur it may be as little cruel and  mischievous as it can be.    But it is one thing to desire a thing and another thing to get it. It  does not follow because this aspiration for world-peace is almost  universal that it will be realized. There may be faults in ourselves,  unsuspected influences within us and without, that may be working to  defeat our superficial sentiments. There must be not only a desire for  peace, but a will for peace, if peace is to be established forever. If  out of a hundred men ninety-nine desire peace and trouble no further,  the one man over will arm himself and set up oppression and war again.  Peace must be organized and maintained. This present monstrous  catastrophe is the outcome of forty-three years of skillful,  industrious, systematic world armament. Only by a disarmament as  systematic, as skillful, and as devoted may we hope to achieve centuries  of peace.    No apology is needed, therefore, for a discussion of the way in which  peace may be organized and established out of the settlement of this  war. I am going to set out and estimate as carefully as I can the forces  that make for a peace organization and the forces that make for war. I  am going to do my best to diagnose the war disorder. I want to find out  first for my own guidance, and then with a view to my co-operation with  other people, what has to be done to prevent the continuation and  recrudescence of warfare.    Such an inquiry is manifestly the necessary first stage in any world  pacification. So manifestly that, of course, countless others are also  setting to work upon it. It is a research. It is a research exactly like  a scientific exploration. Each of us will probably get out a lot of  truth and a considerable amount of error; the truth will be the same and  the errors will confute and disperse each other. But it is clear that  there is no simple panacea in this matter, and that only by intentness  and persistence shall we disentangle a general conception of the road  the peace-desiring multitude must follow.    Now, first be it noted that there is in every one a certain discord with  regard to war. Every man is divided against himself. On the whole, most  of us want peace. But hardly any one is without a lurking belligerence,  a lurking admiration for the vivid impacts, the imaginative appeals of  war. I am sitting down to write for the peace of the world, but  immediately before I sat down to write I was reading the morning's  paper, and particularly of the fight between the Sydney and the Emden  at Cocos Island.    I confess to the utmost satisfaction in the account of the smashing  blows delivered by the guns of the Australian. There is a sensation of  greatness, a beautiful tremendousness, in many of the crude facts of  war; they excite in one a kind of vigorous exaltation; we have that  destructive streak in us, and it is no good pretending that we have not;  the first thing we must do for the peace of the world is to control  that. And to control it one can do nothing more effective than to keep  in mind the other side of the realities of war.    As my own corrective I have at hand certain letters from a very able  woman doctor who returned last week from Calais. Lockjaw, gangrene, men  tied with filthy rags and lying bitterly cold in coaly sheds; men  unwounded, but so broken by the chill horrors of the Yser trenches as to  be near demented--such things make the substance of her picture. One  young officer talked to her rather dryly of the operations, of the  ruined towns and villages, of the stench of dead men and horses, of the  losses and wounds and mutilations among his men, of the list of pals he  had lost. \"Suddenly he began to cry. He broke down just like an  overtaxed child. And he could not stop crying. He cried and cried, and I  could do nothing to help him.\" He was a strong man and a brave man, and  to that"]]]
