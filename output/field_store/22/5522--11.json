[3]    These high pretensions gave scandal to Protestants as well as to  Catholics; and the scandal was greatly increased when the supremacy,  which Mary had resigned back to the Pope, was again annexed to the  crown, on the accession of Elizabeth. It seemed monstrous that a woman  should be the chief bishop of a Church in which an apostle had forbidden  her even to let her voice be heard. The Queen, therefore, found it  necessary expressly to disclaim that sacerdotal character which  her father had assumed, and which, according to Cranmer, had been  inseparably joined, by divine ordinance, to the regal function. When the  Anglican confession of faith was revised in her reign, the supremacy  was explained in a manner somewhat different from that which had been  fashionable at the court of Henry. Cranmer had declared, in emphatic  terms, that God had immediately committed to Christian princes the whole  cure of all their subjects, as well concerning the administration of  God's word for the cure of souls, as concerning the administration of  things political. [4] The thirty-seventh article of religion, framed  under Elizabeth, declares, in terms as emphatic, that the ministering  of God's word does not belong to princes. The Queen, however, still had  over the Church a visitatorial power of vast and undefined extent. She  was entrusted by Parliament with the office of restraining and punishing  heresy and every sort of ecclesiastical abuse, and was permitted to  delegate her authority to commissioners. The Bishops were little more  than her ministers. Rather than grant to the civil magistrate the  absolute power of nominating spiritual pastors, the Church of Rome, in  the eleventh century, set all Europe on fire. Rather than grant to the  civil magistrate the absolute power of nominating spiritual pastors, the  ministers of the Church of Scotland, in our time, resigned their livings  by hundreds. The Church of England had no such scruples. By the royal  authority alone her prelates were appointed. By the royal authority  alone her Convocations were summoned, regulated, prorogued, and  dissolved. Without the royal sanction her canons had no force. One  of the articles of her faith was that without the royal consent no  ecclesiastical council could lawfully assemble. From all her judicatures  an appeal lay, in the last resort, to the sovereign, even when the  question was whether an opinion ought to be accounted heretical, or  whether the administration of a sacrament had been valid. Nor did the  Church grudge this extensive power to our princes. By them she had been  called into existence, nursed through a feeble infancy, guarded from  Papists on one side and from Puritans on the other, protected against  Parliaments which bore her no good will, and avenged on literary  assailants whom she found it hard to answer. Thus gratitude, hope, fear,  common attachments, common enmities, bound her to the throne. All her  traditions, all her tastes, were monarchical. Loyalty became a point  of professional honour among her clergy, the peculiar badge which  distinguished them at once from Calvinists and from Papists. Both the  Calvinists and the Papists, widely as they differed in other respects,  regarded with extreme jealousy all encroachments of the temporal power  on the domain of the spiritual power. Both Calvinists and Papists  maintained that subjects might justifiably draw the sword against  ungodly rulers. In France Calvinists resisted Charles the Ninth: Papists  resisted Henry the Fourth: both Papists and Calvinists resisted Henry  the Third. In Scotland Calvinists led Mary captive. On the north of  the Trent Papists took arms against the English throne. The Church  of England meantime condemned both Calvinists and Papists, and loudly  boasted that no duty was more constantly or earnestly inculcated by her  than that of submission to princes.    The advantages which the crown derived from this close alliance with  the Established Church were great; but they were not without serious  drawbacks. The compromise arranged by Cranmer had from the first been  considered by a large body of Protestants as a scheme for serving two  masters, as an attempt to unite the worship of the Lord with the worship  of Baal. In the days of Edward the Sixth the scruples of this party had  repeatedly thrown great difficulties in the way of the government. When  Elizabeth came to the throne, those difficulties were much increased.  Violence naturally engenders violence. The spirit of Protestantism was  therefore far fiercer and more intolerant after the cruelties of Mary  than before them. Many persons who were warmly attached to the new  opinions had, during the evil days, taken refuge in Switzerland and  Germany. They had been hospitably received by their brethren in the  faith, had sate at the feet of the great doctors of Strasburg, Zurich,  and Geneva, and had been, during some years, accustomed to a more simple  worship, and to a more democratical form of church government, than  England had yet seen. These men returned to their country convinced that  the reform which had been effected under King Edward had been far less  searching and extensive than the interests of pure religion required.  But it was in vain that they attempted to obtain any concession from  Elizabeth. Indeed her system, wherever it differed from her brother's,  seemed to them to differ for the worse. They were little disposed to  submit, in matters of faith, to any human authority. They had recently,  in reliance on their own interpretation of Scripture, risen up against a  Church strong in immemorial antiquity and catholic consent. It was by no  common exertion of intellectual energy that they had thrown off the yoke  of that gorgeous and imperial superstition; and it was vain to expect  that, immediately after such an emancipation, they would patiently  submit to a new spiritual tyranny. Long accustomed, when the priest  lifted up the host, to bow down with their faces to the earth, as before  a present God, they had learned to treat the mass as an idolatrous  mummery. Long accustomed to regard the Pope as the successor of the  chief of the apostles, as the bearer of the keys of earth and heaven,  they had learned to regard him as the Beast, the Antichrist, the Man of  Sin. It was not to be expected that they would immediately transfer  to an upstart authority the homage which they had withdrawn from the  Vatican; that they would submit their private judgment to the authority  of a Church founded on private judgment alone; that they would be afraid  to dissent from teachers who themselves dissented from what had lately  been the universal faith of western Christendom. It is easy to conceive  the indignation which must have been felt by bold and inquisitive  spirits, glorying in newly acquired freedom, when an institution younger  by many years than themselves, an institution which had, under their own  eyes, gradually received its form from the passions and interest of a  court, began to mimic the lofty style of Rome.    Since these men could not be convinced, it was determined that they  should be persecuted. Persecution produced its natural effect on them.  It found them a sect: it made them a faction. To their hatred of the  Church was now added hatred of the Crown. The two sentiments were  intermingled; and each embittered the other. The opinions of the Puritan  concerning the relation of ruler and subject were widely different from  those which were inculcated in the Homilies. His favourite divines had,  both by precept and by example, encouraged resistance to tyrants  and persecutors. His fellow Calvinists in France, in Holland, and  in Scotland, were in arms against idolatrous and cruel princes. His  notions, too, respecting, the government of the state took a tinge  from his notions respecting the government of the Church. Some of the  sarcasms which were popularly thrown on episcopacy might, without much  difficulty, be turned against royalty; and many of the arguments which  were used to prove that spiritual power was best lodged in a synod  seemed to lead to the conclusion that temporal power was best lodged in  a parliament.    Thus, as the priest of the Established Church was, from interest, from  principle, and from passion, zealous for the royal prerogatives, the  Puritan was, from interest, from principle, and from passion, hostile to  them. The power of the discontented sectaries was great. They were found  in every rank; but they were strongest among the mercantile classes in  the towns, and among the small proprietors in the country. Early in  the reign of Elizabeth they began to return a majority of the House of  Commons. And doubtless had our ancestors been then at liberty to fix  their attention entirely on domestic questions, the strife between the  Crown and the Parliament would instantly have commenced. But that was  no season for internal dissensions. It might, indeed, well be doubted  whether the firmest union among all the orders of the state could avert  the common danger by which all were threatened. Roman Catholic Europe  and reformed Europe were struggling for death or life. France divided  against herself, had, for a time, ceased to be of any account in  Christendom. The English Government was at the head of the Protestant  interest, and, while persecuting Presbyterians at home, extended a  powerful protection to Presbyterian Churches abroad. At the head of the  opposite party was the mightiest prince of the age, a prince who ruled  Spain, Portugal, Italy, the East and the West Indies, whose armies  repeatedly marched to Paris, and whose fleets kept the coasts of  Devonshire and Sussex in alarm. It long seemed probable that Englishmen  would have to fight"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1470"],[0,"The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan (#13)"],[1,"the skill and enterprise of his followers and himself.  His ambition was high and bold, perhaps more so than his previous  display of abilities might well warrant. But he soon saw enough  of the weakness of the Emperor, of the treachery and low motives  of the Moghul nobles, to contract the hopes his self-confidence  had fostered. To the historian Gholam Hossain Khan he said: Â—    \"As far as I can see, there is nothing that you could call  government between Patna and Dehli. If men in the position of  Shujaa-ud-daulah would loyally join me, I could not only beat off  the English, but would undertake the administration of the  Empire.\"    The very first step in this ambitious programme was never to be  taken. Whilst the Emperor with his new adherents Â— (and a hundred  Frenchmen under even such a leader as Law were as strong as a  reinforcement of many thousand native troops under a faithless  Moghul)Â—whilst these strangely matched associates were  beleaguering Patna, Captain Knox, at the head of a small body of  infantry, of which only 200 men were European, ran across the 300  miles between Murshidabad and Patna in the space of thirteen  days, and fell upon the Imperial army, whom he utterly routed and  drove southward upon Gaya. The Imperial army was now commanded by  Kamgar Khan; for Mohammad Kuli had returned to Allahabad, and  been murdered by his unscrupulous cousin Shujaa, who seized upon  the province and fort. The Emperor, as is evident from his  retreating southward, still hoped to raise the country in his  favour, and his hopes were so far justified that he was joined by  another Moghul officer, named Khadim Hossain. Thus reinforced, he  again advanced on Patna opposed by Knox, who in his turn had been  joined by a Hindu Raja named Shatab Rai. Another defeat was the  result, and the baffled sovereign at length evacuated the  country, and fled northward, pursued by the whole united forces  of the British and the Bengal Nawab. The son of the latter,  however, being killed in a thunderstorm in July, the allied  armies retired to cantonments at Patna, and the pertinacious  Imperialists once more posted themselves between that place and  the capital, at their old station of Gaya.    1761. Â— Early next year, therefore, the Anglo-Bengali troops once  more took the field, and encountering the Imperialists at Suan,  near the city of Bihar, gave them a fresh overthrow, in which Law  was taken prisoner, fighting to the last, and refusing to  surrender his sword, which he was accordingly permitted to  retain.    Next morning the British commander paid his respects to the  Emperor, who was now quite weary of the hopeless struggle he had  been maintaining for nearly two years, and who willingly departed  towards Hindustan. He had by this time heard of the battle of  Panipat, and of the plans formed by the Abdali for the  restoration of the empire; and there is reason to believe that,  but for the jealousy of Mir Kasim, whom a late revolution  (brought about by the English) had placed in the room of Mir  Jafar, the Emperor would have been at once reinstated at Dehli  under British protection. Before he went he created Mir Kasim  Subahdar; and the fiscal administration also vested in him, the  English having so determined. The Emperor was to have an annual  tribute of Â£240,000.    1762. Â— As affairs turned out there was much to be done and  suffered by the British before they had another opportunity of  interfering in the affairs of Hindustan; and a strange series of  vicissitudes impended upon the Emperor before he was to meet them  in the palace of his fathers. On his way to the northwest he fell  into the hands of the ambitious Nawab Vazir of Audh, who had  received the Abdali's orders to render the Emperor all  assistance, and who carried out the letter of these instructions  by retaining him for some two years in an honourable confinement,  surrounded by the empty signs of sovereignty, sometimes at  Benares, sometimes at Allahabad, and sometimes at Lucknow.    1763. Â— In the meanwhile the unscrupulous heroes who were  founding the British Government of India had thought proper to  quarrel with their new instrument Mir Kasim, whom they had so  lately raised to the Masnad of Bengal. This change in their  councils had been caused by an insubordinate letter addressed to  the Court of Directors by Clive's party, which had led to their  dismissal from employ. The opposition then raised to power  consisted of all the more corrupt members of the service; and the  immediate cause of their rupture with Mir Kasim was about the  monopoly they desired to have of the local trade for their own  private advantage. They were represented at that Nawab's Court by  Mr. Ellis, the most violent of their body; and the consequence of  his proceedings was, in no long time, seen in the murder of the  Resident and all his followers, in October, 1763. The scene of  this atrocity (which remained without a parallel for nearly a  century) was at Patna, which was then threatened and soon after  stormed by the British; and the actual instrument was a  Franco-German, Walter Reinhardt by name, of whom, as we are to  hear much more hereafter, it is as well here to take note.    This European executioner of Asiatic barbarity is generally  believed to have been a native of Treves, in the Duchy of  Luxemburg, who came to India as a sailor in the French navy. From  this service he is said to have deserted to the British, and  joined the first European battalion raised in Bengal. Thence  deserting he once more entered the French service; was sent with  a party who vainly attempted to relieve Chandarnagar, and was one  of the small party who followed Law when that officer took  command of those, who refused to share in the surrender of the  place to the British. After the capture of his ill-starred chief,  Reinhardt (whom we shall in future designate by his Indian  sobriquet of \" Sumroo,\" or Sombre) took service under Gregory, or  Gurjin Khan, Mir Kasim's Armenian General.    Broome, however, adopts a somewhat different version. According  to this usually careful and accurate historian, Reinhardt was a  Salzburg man who originally came to India in the British service,  and deserted to the French at Madras, whence he was sent by Lally  to strengthen the garrison of the Bengal settlement. The details  are not very material: Sumroo had certainly learned war both in  English and French schools.    After the massacre of the British, Kasim and his bloodhound  escaped from Patna (which the British stormed and took on the 6th  of November), and found a temporary asylum in the dominions of  Shojaa-ud-daulah. That nobleman solemnly engaged to support his  former antagonist, and sent him for the present against some  enemies of his own in Bundelkand, himself marching to Benares  with his Imperial captive, as related in the preceding page.    1764. Â— In February, 1764, the avenging columns of the British  appeared upon the frontier, but the Sepoys broke into mutiny,  which lasted some time, and was with difficulty and but  imperfectly quelled by Colonel Carnac. Profiting by the delay and  confusion thus caused, the allies crossed into Bihar, and made a  furious, though ultimately unsuccessful attack upon the British  lines under the walls of Patna on the 3rd of May.  Shujaa-ud-daulah, the Nawab of Audh, temporarily retiring, the  Emperor resumed negotiations with the British commander; but  before these could be concluded, the latter was superseded by  Major (afterwards Sir Hector) Monro. This officer's arrival  changed the face of affairs. Blowing from guns twenty-four of the  most discontented of the sepoys, the Major led the now submissive  army westward to Buxar (Baksar), near the confluence of the  Karamnassa with the Ganges, where the two Nawabs (for Kasim and  the Audh Viceroy had now united their forces) encountered him to  be totally routed on the 23rd October, 1764.    The Emperor, who had taken no part in the action, came into the  camp on the evening of the following day. By the negotiations  which ultimately ensued, the British at last obtained a legal  position as administrators of the three Subahs, with the further  grant of the Benares and Ghazipur sarkars as fiefs of the Empire.  The remainder of the Subah of Allahabad was secured to the  Emperor with a pecuniary stipend which raised his income to the  nominal amount of a million a year of our money.    But the execution of these measures required considerable delay,  and some further exercise of that pertinacious vigour which  peculiarly distinguished the British in the eighteenth century.    Shujaa-ud-daulah fled first to Faizabad in his own territories;  but, hearing that Allahabad had fallen, and that the English were  marching on Lucknow, he had recourse to the Pathans of Rohilkand,  whose hospitality he afterwards repaid with characteristic  ingratitude. Not only did the chiefs of the Rohillas harbour the  Nawab Vazir's family at Bareilly, but they also lent him the aid  of 3,000 of their troops. Further supported by the restless  Mahrattas of Malhar Rao Holkar, a chief who always maintained  relations with the Musulmans, Shujaa returned to the conflict.    1765. Â— It may be easily imagined that what he failed to do with  the aid of Mir Kasim and his own territory, he did not effect  with his present friends as an exile; and Kasim having fled, and  Sumroo having entered the service of the Jats of Bhartpur, the  Vazir consented to negotiate with the English; the latter, under  strong pressure from Clive, who had lately returned to India,  showing themselves perfectly placable, now that it had become  impossible for them to insist upon the terms, so distasteful to  an Eastern chief, which required the surrender of his infamous  guests. General Carnac, who had resumed the command, gave the  Nawab and his allies a final defeat near Cawnpore, and drove the  Mahrattas across the Jamna."]]]
