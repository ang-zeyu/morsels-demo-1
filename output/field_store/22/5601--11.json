I wish to goodness that they had neglected  it, for I could not move a gun, even if I did not give the order till  midnight, but they knew it by daylight next morning. And they had their  agents, who gave them their intelligence through thick and thin. I locked  up everybody who I thought could go and tell, but somehow or other the  intelligence went on.\"    The Boer was an effective scout because he was familiar with the country,  and because his eyes were far better than those of any of the men against  whom he was pitted. The South African atmosphere is extraordinarily clear,  and every person has a long range of vision, but the Boer, who was  accustomed to the climatic conditions, could distinguish between Boer and  Briton where the stranger could barely see a moving object. Field-glasses  were almost valueless to Boer scouts, and few of them were carried by any  one except the generals and commandants, who secured them from the War  Department before the beginning of the war. There was no distinct branch  of the army whose exclusive duty it was to scout, and there was even  greater lack of organisation in the matter of securing information  concerning the movements of the enemy than in the other departments of the  army's work. When a general or commandant felt that it was necessary to  secure accurate information concerning the enemy's strength and  whereabouts he asked for volunteers to do the work. Frequently, during the  Natal campaign, no scouting was done for days, and the generals were  absolutely ignorant of everything in connection with the enemy. Later in  the campaign several scouting corps composed of foreign volunteers were  organised, and thereafter the Boers depended wholly upon the information  they secured. There was no regulation which forbade burghers from leaving  the laagers at any time, or from proceeding in any direction, and much of  the information that reached the generals was obtained from these rovers  over the veld. It was extremely difficult for a man who did not have the  appearance of a burgher to ride over the veld for more than a mile without  being hailed by a Boer who seemed to have risen out of the earth  unnoticed. \"Where are you going?\" or \"Where are you coming from?\" were his  invariable salutations, and if the stranger was unable to give a  satisfactory reply or show proper passports he was commanded, \"Hands up.\"  The burghers were constantly on the alert when they were on the veld,  whether they were merely wandering about, leaving for home, or returning  to the laager, and as soon as they secured any information which they  believed was valuable they dashed away to the nearest telegraph or  heliograph station, and reported it to their general or commandant. In  addition to this valuable attribute the Boers had the advantage of being  among white and black friends who could assist them in a hundred different  ways in securing information concerning the enemy, and all these  circumstances combined to warrant General White's estimate of the Boers'  intelligence department, which, notwithstanding its efficiency, was more  or less chimerical.    In no department or branch of the army was there any military discipline  or system, except in the two small bodies of men known as the State  Artillery of the Transvaal and the State Artillery of the Free State.  These organisations were in existence many years before the war was begun,  and had regular drills and practice which were maintained when they were  at the front. The Johannesburg Police also had a form of discipline which,  however, was not strict enough to prevent the men from becoming mutinous  when they imagined that they had fought the whole war themselves, and  wanted to have a vacation in order that they might visit their homes. The  only vestige of real military discipline that was to be found in the  entire Boer army was that which was maintained by Field-Cornet A.L.  Thring, of the Kroonstad commando, who had a roll-call and inspection of  rifles every morning. This extraordinary procedure was not relished by the  burghers, who made an indignant protest to General Christian De Wet. The  general upheld the field-cornet's action, and told the men that if all the  officers had instituted similar methods more success might have attended  the army's operations.    With the exception of the instances cited, every man was a disciplinary  law unto himself, and when he transgressed that law no one would punish  him but his conscience. There were laws on the subject of obedience in the  army, and each had penalties attached to it, but it was extremely rare  that a burgher was punished. When he endured discipline he did it because  he cared to do so, and not because he feared those who had authority over  him. He was deeply religious, and he felt that in being obedient he was  finding favour in the eyes of the Providence that favoured his cause. It  was as much his religion as his ability to aim unerringly that made the  Boer a good soldier. If the Boer army had been composed of an irreligious,  undisciplined body of men, instead of the psalm-singing farmers, it would  have been conquered by itself. The religion of the Boers was their  discipline.          CHAPTER V    THE BOER MILITARY SYSTEM      The disparity between the British and Boer armies seemed to be so great at  the time the war was begun that the patriotic Englishman could hardly be  blamed for asserting that the struggle would be of only a month's  duration. On the one side was an army every branch of which was highly  developed and specialised and kept in constant practice by many wars waged  under widely different conditions. Back of it was a great nation, with  millions of men and unlimited resources to draw upon. At the head of the  army were men who had the theory and practice of warfare as few leaders of  other armies had had the opportunities of securing them. Opposed to this  army was practically an aggregation of farmers, hastily summoned together  and utterly without discipline or training. They were unable to replace  with another a single fallen burgher and prevented from adding by  importation to their stock of ammunition a single rifle or a single pound  of powder. At the head were farmers who, perhaps, did not know that there  existed a theory of warfare and much less knew how recent wars were fought  and won. The means by which thirty thousand farmers of no military  training were enabled to withstand the opposition of several hundred  thousand well-trained soldiers for the greater part of a year must be  attributed to the military system which gave such a marvellous advantage.  Such success as attended the Boer army was undoubtedly the success of its  system of warfare against that of the British.    [Illustration: BOER COMMANDANTS READING MESSAGE FROM BRITISH OFFICERS  AFTER THE BATTLE OF DUNDEE]    The Boers themselves were not aware that they had a military system; at  least, none of the generals or men acknowledged the existence of such, and  it was not an easy matter to find evidences that battles were fought and  movements made according to certain established rules which suggested a  system. The Boers undoubtedly had a military plan of their own which was  naturally developed in their many wars with natives and with the British  troops. It might not have been a system, according to the correct  definition of the term--it might have been called an instinct for  fighting, or a common-sense way of attempting to defeat an enemy--but it  was a matter which existed in the mind of every single citizen of the two  Republics. It was not to be learned from books or teachers, nor could it  be taught to those who were not born in the country. Whatever that system  was, it was extremely rudimentary, and was never developed to any extent  by the discipline and training which any system necessarily requires in  order to make it effective. There was a natural system or manner used by  the Boers when hunting for lion or buck, and it was identically the same  which they applied against the British army. Every Boer was expert in the  use of his rifle; he had an excellent eye for country and cover; he was  able to tell at a glance whether a hill or an undulation in the ground was  suitable for fighting purposes, whether it could be defended and whether  it offered facilities for attack or retreat. Just as every Boer was a  general, so it was that every burgher had in his mind a certain military  plan fashioned after the needs and opportunities of the country, and this  was their system--a sort of national as well as natural military system.    In the British army, as well as in the other modern armies, the soldier is  supposed to understand nothing, know nothing, and do nothing but give  obedience to the commands of his officers. The trained soldier learns  little, and is supposed to learn little, of anything except the evolutions  he is taught on the drill-grounds. It is presumed that he is stupid, and  the idea appears to be to prevent him from being otherwise in order that  he may the better fulfil his part in the great machine to which a trained  army has been likened. The soldier is regarded as an animal of low mental  grade, whose functions are merely to obey the orders of the man who has  been chosen by beings of superior intelligence to lead him. When the man  who was chosen in times of peace to lead the men in times of war meets the  enemy and fails to make a display of the military knowledge which it was  presumed he possessed, then the soldiers who look to him for leadership  are generally useless, and oftentimes worse than useless, inasmuch as  their panic is likely to become infectious among neighbouring bodies of  soldiers who are equipped with better leaders. In trained armies the value  of a soldier is a mere reflection of the value"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16467"],[0,"Musicians of To-Day (#13)"],[1,"by faulty time or  want of precision. Even to-day, when our orchestras are seasoned by  years of study, I should often be unable to follow Wagner's thought  throughout a whole scene if I did not happen to know the score, for the  outline of a melody is often smothered by the accompaniment, and so its  sentiment is lost. If we still find obscurity of meaning in Wagner's  works you can imagine how much worse it was then. But what did it  matter? I used to feel myself stirred with passions that were not human:  some magnetic influence seemed to thrill me with both pleasure and pain,  and I felt invigorated and happy, for it brought me strength. It seemed  as if my child's heart were torn from me and the heart of a hero put in  its place.    Nor was I alone in the experience. On the faces of the people round  about me I saw the reflection of my own emotions. What was the meaning  of it? The audience consisted chiefly of poor and commonplace people,  whose faces were lined with the wear and tear of a life without interest  or ideals; their minds were dull and heavy, and yet here they responded  to the divine spirit of the music. There is no more impressive sight  than that of thousands of people held spellbound by a melody; it is by  turns sublime, grotesque, and touching.    What a place in my life those Sunday concerts held! All the week I lived  for those two hours; and when they were over I thought about them until  the following Sunday. The fascination of Wagner's music for youth has  often troubled people; they think it poisons the thoughts and dulls the  activities. But the generation that was then intoxicated by Wagner does  not seem to have shown signs of demoralisation since. Why do not people  understand that if we had need of that music it was not because it was  death to us, but life. Cramped by the artificiality of a town, far from  action, or nature, or any strong or real life, we expanded under the  influence of this noble music--music which flowed from a heart filled  with understanding of the world and the breath of Nature. In _Die  Meistersinger_, in _Tristan_, and in _Siegfried_, we went to find the  joy, the love, and the vigour that we so lacked.    At the time when I was feeling Wagner's seductiveness so strongly there  were always some carping people among my elders ready to quench my  admiration and say with a superior smile: \"That is nothing. One can't  judge Wagner at a concert. You must hear him in the opera-house at  Bayreuth.\" Since then I have been several times to Bayreuth; I have seen  Wagner's works performed in Berlin, in Dresden, in Munich, and in other  German towns, but I have never again felt the old intoxication. People  are wrong to pretend that closer acquaintance with a fine work adds to  one's enjoyment of it. It may throw light upon it, but it nips one's  imagination and dispels the mystery. The puzzling fragments one hears at  concerts will take on splendid proportions on account of all the mind  adds to them. That epic poem of the _Niebelungen_ was once like a forest  in our dreams, where strange and awful beings flashed before our vision  and then vanished. Later on, when we had explored all its paths, we  discovered that order and reason reigned in the midst of this apparent  jungle; and when we came to know the least wrinkle on the faces of its  inhabitants, the confusion and emotion of other days no longer filled  us.    But this may be the result of growing older; and if I do not recognise  the Wagner of other days, it is perhaps because I do not recognise my  former self. A work of art, and above all a work of musical art, changes  with ourselves. _Siegfried_, for example, is for me no longer full of  mystery. The qualities in it that strike me to-day are its cheerful  vigour, its clearness of form, its virile force and freedom, and the  extraordinary healthiness of the hero, and, indeed, of the whole work.    I sometimes think of poor Nietzsche and his passion for destroying the  things he loved, and how he sought in others the decadence that was  really in himself. He tried to embody this decadence in Wagner, and, led  away by his flights of fancy and his mania for paradox (which would be  laughable if one did not remember that his whims were not hatched in  hours of happiness), he denied Wagner his most obvious qualities--his  vigour, his determination, his unity, his logic, and his power of  progress. He amused himself by comparing Wagner's style with that of  Goncourt, by making him--with amusing irony--a great miniaturist  painter, a poet of half-tones, a musician of affectations and  melancholy, so delicate and effeminate in style that \"after him all  other musicians seemed too robust.\"[108] He has painted Wagner and his  time delightfully. We all enjoy these little pictures of the Tetralogy,  delicately drawn and worked up by the aid of a  magnifying-glass--pictures of Wagner, languishing and beautiful, in a  mournful salon, and pictures of the athletic meetings of the other  musicians, who were \"too robust\"! The amusing part is that this piece of  wit has been taken seriously by certain arbiters of elegance, who are  only too happy to be able to run counter to any current opinion,  whatever it may be.    [Footnote 108: F. Nietzsche, _Der Fall Wagner_.]    I do not say that there may not be a decadent side in Wagner, revealing  super-sensitiveness or even hysteria and other modern nervous  affections. And if this side was lacking he would not be representative  of his time, and that is what every great artist ought to be. But there  is certainly something more in him than decadence; and if women and  young men cannot see anything beyond it, it only proves their inability  to get outside themselves. A long time ago Wagner himself complained to  Liszt that neither the public nor artists knew how to listen to or  understand any side of his music but the effeminate side: \"They do not  grasp its strength,\" he said. \"My supposed successes,\" he also tells us,  \"are founded on misunderstanding. My public reputation isn't worth a  walnut-shell.\" And it is true he has been applauded, patronised, and  monopolised for a quarter of a century by all the decadents of art and  literature. Scarcely anyone has seen in him a vigorous musician and a  classic writer, or has recognised him as Beethoven's direct successor,  the inheritor of his heroic and pastoral genius, of his epic  inspirations and battlefield rhythms, of his Napoleonic phrases and  atmosphere of stirring trumpet-calls.    Nowhere is Wagner nearer to Beethoven than in _Siegfried_. In _Die  Walkuere_ certain characters, certain phrases of Wotan, of Bruennhilde,  and, especially, of Siegmund, bear a close relationship to Beethoven's  symphonies and sonatas. I can never play the recitative _con espressione  e semplice_ of the seventeenth sonata for the piano (Op. 31, No. 2)  without being reminded of the forests of _Die Walkuere_ and the fugitive  hero. But in _Siegfried_ I find, not only a likeness to Beethoven in  details, but the same spirit running through the work--both the poem and  the music. I cannot help thinking that Beethoven would perhaps have  disliked _Tristan_, but would have loved _Siegfried_; for the latter is  a perfect incarnation of the spirit of old Germany, virginal and gross,  sincere and malicious, full of humour and sentiment, of deep feeling, of  dreams of bloody and joyous battles, of the shade of great oak-trees and  the song of birds.           *       *       *       *       *    In my opinion, _Siegfried_, in spirit and in form, stands alone in  Wagner's work. It breathes perfect health and happiness, and it  overflows with gladness. Only _Die Meistersinger_ rivals it in  merriment, though even there one does not find such a nice balance of  poetry and music.    And _Siegfried_ rouses one's admiration the more when one thinks that it  was the offspring of sickness and suffering. The time at which Wagner  wrote it was one of the saddest in his life. It often happens so in art.  One goes astray in trying to interpret an artist's life by his work, for  it is exceptional to find one a counterpart of the other. It is more  likely that an artist's work will express the opposite of his life--the  things that he did not experience. The object of art is to fill up what  is missing in the artist's experience: \"Art begins where life leaves  off,\" said Wagner. A man of action is rarely pleased with stimulating  works of art. Borgia and Sforza patronised Leonardo. The strong,  full-blooded men of the seventeenth century; the apoplectic court at  Versailles (where Fagon's lancet played so necessary a part); the  generals and ministers who harassed the Protestants and burned the  Palatinate--all these loved pastorales. Napoleon wept at a reading of  _Paul et Virginie_, and delighted in the pallid music of Paesiello. A  man wearied by an over-active life seeks repose in art; a man who lives  a narrow, commonplace life seeks energy in art. A great artist writes a  gay work when he is sad, and a sad work when he is gay, almost in spite  of himself. Beethoven's symphony _To Joy_ is the offspring of his  misery; and Wagner's _Meistersinger_ was composed immediately after the  failure of _Tannhaeuser_ in Paris. People try to find in _Tristan_ the  trace of some love-story of Wagner's, but Wagner himself says: \"As in  all my life I have never truly tasted the happiness of love, I will  raise a monument to a beautiful dream of it: I have the idea of _Tristan  und Isolde_ in my head.\" And so it was with his creation of the happy  and heedless _Siegfried_.             *       *       *       *       *    The first ideas of _Siegfried_ were contemporary with the Revolution of  1848, which Wagner took part in with the same enthusiasm he put into  everything else.
