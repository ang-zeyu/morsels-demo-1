The odor of santal assimilates well with rose; and hence, prior to the  cultivation of rose-leaf geranium, it was used to adulterate otto of  roses; but is now but seldom used for that purpose.    By a \"phonetic\" error, santal is often printed \"sandal,\" and \"sandel.\"    SASSAFRAS.--Some of the perfumers of Germany use a tincture of  the wood of the _Laurus sassafras_ in the manufacture of hair-washes and  other nostrums; but as, in our opinion, it has rather a \"physicky\" smell  than flowery, we cannot recommend the German recipes. The _Eau  Athenienne_, notwithstanding, has some reputation as a hair-water, but  is little else than a weak tincture of sassafras.    SPIKE.--French oil of lavender, which is procured from the  _Lavandula spica_, is generally called oil of spike. (See Lavender.)    STORAX and TOLU are used in perfumery in the same way  as benzoin, namely, by solution in spirit as a tincture. An ounce of  tincture of storax, tolu, or benzoin, being added to a pound of any very  volatile perfume, gives a degree of permanence to it, and makes it last  longer on the handkerchief than it otherwise would: thus, when any  perfume is made by the solution of an otto in spirit, it is usual to add  to it a small portion of a substance which is less volatile, such as  extract of musk, extract of vanilla, ambergris, storax, tolu, orris,  vitivert, or benzoin; the manufacturer using his judgment and discretion  as to which of these materials are to be employed, choosing, of course,  those which are most compatible with the odor he is making.    The power which these bodies have of \"fixing\" a volatile substance,  renders them valuable to the perfumer, independent of their aroma, which  is due in many cases to benzoic acid, slightly modified by an esential  oil peculiar to each substance, and which is taken up by the alcohol,  together with a portion of resin. When the perfume is put upon a  handkerchief, the most volatile bodies disappear first: thus, after the  alcohol has evaporated, the odor of the ottos appear stronger; if it  contains any resinous body, the ottos are held in solution, as it were,  by the resin, and thus retained on the fabric. Supposing a perfume to be  made of otto only, without any \"fixing\" substance, then, as the perfume  \"dies away,\" the olfactory nerve, if tutored, will detect its  composition, for it spontaneously analyzes itself, no two ottos having  the same volatility: thus, make a mixture of rose, jasmine, and  patchouly; the jasmine predominates first, then the rose, and, lastly,  the patchouly, which will be found hours after the others have  disappeared.    SYRINGA.--The flowers of the _Philadelphus coronarius_, or  common garden syringa, have an intense odor resembling the  orange-blossom; so much so, that in America the plant is often termed  \"mock orange.\" A great deal of the pomatum sold as pommade surfin, a la  fleur d'orange, by the manufacturers of Cannes, is nothing more than  fine suet perfumed with syringa blossoms by the maceration process.  Fine syringa pomade could be made in England at a quarter the cost of  what is paid for the so-called orange pomatum.    THYME.--All the different species of thyme, but more  particularly the lemon thyme, the _Thymus serpyllum_, as well as the  marjorams, origanum, &c., yield by distillation fragrant ottos, that are  extensively used by manufacturing perfumers for scenting soaps; though  well adapted for this purpose, they do not answer at all in any other  combinations. Both in grease and in spirit all these ottos impart an  herby smell (very naturally) rather than a flowery one, and, as a  consequence, they are not considered _recherche_.    When any of these herbs are dried and ground, they usefully enter into  the composition of sachet powders.    TONQUIN, or TONKA.--The seeds of the _Dipterix  odorata_ are the tonquin or _coumarouma_ beans of commerce. When fresh  they are exceedingly fragrant, having an intense odor of newly made hay.  The _Anthoxanthum odoratum_, or sweet-smelling vernal grass, to which  new hay owes its odor, probably yields identically the same fragrant  principle, and it is remarkable that both tonquin beans and vernal  grass, while actually growing, are nearly scentless, but become rapidly  aromatic when severed from the parent stock.    Chemically considered, tonquin beans are very interesting, containing,  when fresh, a fragrant volatile otto (to which their odor is  principally due), benzoic acid, a fat oil and a neutral  principal--_Coumarin_. In perfumery they are valuable, as, when ground,  they form with other bodies an excellent and permanent sachet, and by  infusion in spirit, the tincture or extract of tonquin enters into a  thousand of the compound essences; but on account of its great strength  it must be used with caution, otherwise people say your perfume is  \"snuffy,\" owing to the predominance of the odor and its well-known use  in the boxes of those who indulge in the titillating dust.    [Illustration: Tonquin.]    EXTRACT OF TONQUIN.    Tonquin beans,              1 lb.  Rectified spirit,       1 gallon.    Digest for a month at a summer heat. Even after this maceration they are  still useful when dried and ground in those compounds known as POT  POURRI, OLLA PODRIA, &c. The extract of tonquin, like  extract of orris and extract of vanilla, is never sold pure, but is only  used in the manufacture of compound perfumes. It is the leading  ingredient in _Bouquet du Champ_--The field Bouquet--the great  resemblance of which to the odor of the hay-field, renders it a favorite  to the lovers of the pastoral.    TUBEROSE.--One of the most exquisite odors with which we are  acquainted is obtained by _enfleurage_ from the tuberose flower. It is,  as it were, a nosegay in itself, and reminds one of that delightful  perfume observed in a well-stocked flower-garden at evening close;  consequently it is much in demand by the perfumers for compounding sweet  essences.    EXTRACT OF TUBEROSE.    Eight pounds of No. 24 tuberose pomatum, cut up very fine, is to be  placed into 1 gallon of the best rectified spirit. After standing for  three weeks or a month at summer heat, and with frequent agitation, it  is fit to draw off, and being strained through cotton wool, is ready  either for sale or use in the manufacture of bouquets.    This essence of tuberose, like that of jasmine, is exceedingly volatile,  and if sold in its pure state quickly \"flies off\" the handkerchief; it  is therefore necessary to add some fixing ingredient, and for this  purpose it is best to use one ounce of extract of orris, or half an  ounce of extract of vanilla, to every pint of tuberose.    VANILLA.--The pod or bean of the _Vanilla planifolia_ yields a  perfume of rare excellence. When good, and if kept for some time, it  becomes covered with an efflorescence of needle crystals possessing  properties similar to benzoic acid, but differing from it in  composition. Few objects are more beautiful to look upon than this, when  viewed by a microscope with the aid of polarized light.    [Illustration: Vanilla.]    EXTRACT OF VANILLA.    Vanilla pods,                 1/2 lb.  Rectified spirit,           1 gallon.    Slit the pods from end to end, so as to lay open the interior, then cut  them up in lengths of about a quarter of an inch, macerate with  occasional agitation for about a month; the tincture thus formed will  only require straining through cotton to be ready for any use that is  required. In this state it is rarely sold for a perfume, but is consumed  in the manufacture of compound odors, bouquets, or nosegays, as they  are called.    Extract of Vanilla is also used largely in the manufacture of  hair-washes, which are readily made by mixing the extract of vanilla  with either rose, orange, elder, or rosemary water, and afterwards  filtering.    We need scarcely mention, that vanilla is greatly used by cooks and  confectioners for flavoring.    VERBENA, or VERVAINE.--The scented species of this  plant, the lemon verbena, _Aloysia citriodora_ (Hooker), gives one of  the finest perfumes with which we are acquainted; it is well known as  yielding a delightful fragrance by merely drawing the hand over the  plant; some of the little vessels or sacks containing the otto must be  crushed in this act, as there is little or no odor by merely smelling at  the plant.    The otto, which can be extracted from the leaves by distillation with  water, on account of its high price, is scarcely, if ever, used by the  manufacturing perfumer, but it is most successfully imitated by mixing  the otto of lemon grass, _Andropogon schoenanthus_, with rectified  spirit, the odor of which resembles the former to a nicety. The  following is a good form for making the    EXTRACT OF VERBENA.    Rectified spirit,            1 pint.  Otto of lemon grass,      3 drachms.    \"     lemon peel,            2 oz.    \"     orange peel,         1/2 oz.    After standing together for a few hours and then filtering, it is fit  for sale.    Another mixture of this kind, presumed by the public to be made from the  same plant, but of a finer quality, is composed thus--it is sold under  the title    EXTRAIT DE VERVEINE.    Rectified spirit,                   1 pint.  Otto of orange peel,                  1 oz.   \" lemon peel,                        2 oz.   \" citron,                        1 drachm.   \" lemon grass,              2-1/2 drachms.  Extrait de fleur d'orange,            7 oz.   \"           \"  tubereuse,            7 oz.  Esprit de rose,                   1/2 pint.

The effort is surely worth       making, and anything like a determined effort on the part of the       Sovereign, and Her Majesty's immediate advisers would find a most       vigorous and cordial response.         \"The idea of confederation seems to be quite dependent upon such       preliminaries, as mutual confidence, and a measure of common       necessity, in order to such a question being seriously entertained.         \"The Colonial Conference of two years ago, seems however to have       paved the way for effective development in the direction of       confederation.         \"For it must be remembered, that the somewhat complex British       constitution is not the creation of any one Monarch, or Parliament.       It has grown to its present dimensions little by little, influenced       always by the necessities of particular cases. The House of Peers       has ever been summoned by writ, and early precedents indicate, that       the Sovereign was not always limited to a particular class of       Barons, who alone could be invited to the deliberations of the       nation.         \"Although it is not admitted, it is nevertheless the fact, that, at       the present time, all who are most anxiously desirous of seeing a       way to establish a means of drawing together, in Council, the       Colonies and the Mother Country, are quite disagreed, as to what is       the best means to this end.         \"A formal confederation is desired, but all are agreed upon the       difficulties which, for the present, at any rate, stand in the way       of completing an exactly defined treaty, or definition, to       confederate as between the Mother Country, and the Colonies.         \"Perhaps a means to this much-desired end may be discovered, by way       of less formal, but almost equally effective, courses of policy as       regards Colonial possessions.         \"Every one feels the difficulty in the way of summoning Colonial       Representatives to either the House of Lords or the House of       Commons, for, while special provision would be required to increase       the numbers of the House of Commons, there are apparent and real       obstacles in the way of inviting Colonial Representatives to sit in       the House of Lords, either as ordinary, or as _Life_ Peers.         \"It does not seem too much to hope that, before long, the Crown,       may desire to see assembled in London, during some period of the       annual session of the Imperial Parliament a Council of Colonial       Delegates, meeting in a place to be assigned to them, who will have       no voice in other than Colonial Policy, just as now, the House of       Lords has no voice in the originating of Money Bills, who will be       free to discuss any measure affecting Colonial Policy in general,       or the affairs of any Colony, in particular, who will be entitled       to forward their conclusions, requests, or opinions to Her       Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, and who       will constitute a most effective means for ascertaining the current       of opinion in any particular Colony for the time being.         \"The Houses of Convocation might be referred to as an example of an       extra Parliamentary Body of recognised position in the       deliberations of the State.         \"And, to revert to South Africa, the sympathies, and probably loyal       adhesion of all the intelligent classes of every nationality, would       be elicited by nothing more than by the express personal interest       of the Sovereign, and Her family in the Cape Colony. The occasion       of the visit of Prince Alfred, when a mere child, elicited       unbounded demonstrations of enthusiastic loyalty to the Crown, and       those from Dutch and English alike. The name 'Alfred,' in honour       of His Royal Highness, is to be everywhere met with in connection       with all sorts of public bodies, Volunteer Corps, and other       Institutions.         \"Personal influence goes for more than all the defined policies of       successive administrations, or excellent theories of Government. A       Prince is of more weight than the best of official Governors, and       it is not likely that in medieval ages, or even at later periods,       such an appanage of the Crown, as we desire South Africa to become,       would be unvisited by either the Sovereign, or someone of the       Sovereign's family. The visit of their Royal Highnesses Prince       Albert Victor, and Prince George of Wales was limited to a brief       sojourn at Cape Town, and did not extend to the Colony in general.         \"The necessity for the employment, in the interests of the Empire,       to use the phrase most practical,--uncouth, however, it may       seem,--of our Royal Princes appears to be a very decided and       certain means to the end we have in view, namely, the binding       together, by means of sympathetic enthusiasm, the Colonies to the       Mother Country, but most particularly the creating of a healthy       common accord between South Africa and Great Britain.         \"Let any Colony or Dependency feel assured that it is regarded as       worthy of attention by those nearest to the Crown, and any sense of       isolation, any suspicion that the people, or their country are       regarded with any measure of contemptuous indifference must       forthwith vanish. Sympathy, encouragement, personal contact, seem       to be essential elements to the solution of what is admittedly a       problem.\"    I regard this letter of my well informed correspondent as a most  interesting and truthful expression of wide-spread opinion, among the  intelligent classes of Her Majesty's loyal subjects in South Africa.    I do not believe the South African political problem to be insoluble.  Two things are required to solve it satisfactorily. For the present,--I  quote the eloquent words of a distinguished politician with whose wise  and noble sentiments I cordially agree--\"what we ought to do in a case  of this kind is to send out a statesman of the first order of talent,  patience, and truthfulness, irrespective of politics or prejudice. For  it is an Imperial problem of the highest importance; and the powers of  true patriotism and ambition should be amply gratified in dealing with  it.\"    And for the future, let me add my own earnest conviction, that what is  wanted is Imperial Federation, as the goal to be ultimately reached, to  render South Africa politically satisfied and content.    Imperial Federation means a constitutional system, under which she would  be no longer misruled and misunderstood, by a Government, in which she  has no share, in which she places no confidence, and by whom her wants  and wishes are often ignored. It is not, as is frequently untruly  asserted by writers, and speakers, who have neither studied,  comprehended, nor understood its theory and intention, its end and aim,  that it means the subjugation of the independence of the Colonies to the  control of the Mother Country.    As one of its most earnest advocates, I emphatically protest against all  such erroneous interpretations, as a libel on the principle put forward,  as a plan for the National Government. On the contrary, the project of  Imperial Federation, without any _arriere pensee_, clearly and  distinctly involves the condition, that the Colonies themselves are to  take their adequate part, and share with the Mother Country in its  future concrete constitution. In the brief, but expressive phrase, I  have already publicly adopted, Imperial Federation means, \"the  Government of the Empire by the Empire.\" In Imperial Federation,  therefore, South Africa would be fairly and influentially represented,  along with the other Colonies of Great Britain. In union with them she  would take her part in guiding the policy, and directing the destinies  of the whole British Empire.
