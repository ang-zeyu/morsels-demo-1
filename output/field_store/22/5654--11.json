[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17388"],[0,"Andrew Marvell (#13)"],[1,", form a remarkable constellation. Old Noll,  we may be sure, had nothing to do with it. Marvell must have known  Cromwell personally; but there is nothing to show that Milton and  Cromwell ever met. The popular engraving which represents a theatrical  Lord-Protector dictating despatches to a meek Milton is highly  ludicrous. Cromwell could have as easily dictated a book of _Paradise  Lost_, on the composition of which Milton began to be engaged during the  last year of the Protectorate, as one of Milton's despatches.    In April 1657 Admiral Blake, the first great name in the annals of our  navy, performed his last feat of arms by destroying the Spanish West  Indian fleet at Santa Cruz without the loss of an English vessel. The  gallant sailor died of fever on his way home, and was buried according  to his deserts in the Abbey. His body, with that of his master, was by a  vote of Parliament, December 4, 1660, taken from the grave and drawn to  the gallows-tree, and there hanged and buried under it. Pepys, who was  to know something of naval administration under the second Charles, has  his reflections on this unpleasing incident.    Marvell's lines on Blake's victory over the Spaniards are not worthy of  so glorious an occasion, but our great doings by land and sea have  seldom been suitably recorded in verse. Drayton's _Song of Agincourt_ is  imperishable, but was composed nearly two centuries after the battle.  The wail of Flodden Field still floats over the Border; but Miss  Elliot's famous ballad was published in 1765. Even the Spanish Armada  had to wait for Macaulay's spirited fragment. Mr. Addison's _Blenheim_  stirred no man's blood; no poet sang Chatham's victories.[70:1] Campbell  at a later day did better. We must be content with what we get.    Marvell's poem contains some vigorous lines, which show he was a good  hater:--        \"Now does Spain's fleet her spacious wings unfold,      Leaves the new world, and hastens for the old;      But though the wind was fair, they slowly swum,      Freighted with acted guilt, and guilt to come;      For this rich load, of which so proud they are,      Was raised by tyranny, and raised for war.      ...      ...      For now upon the main themselves they saw      That boundless empire, where you give the law.\"    The Canary Islands are rapturously described--their delightful climate  and their excellent wine. Obviously they should be annexed:--        \"The best of lands should have the best of Kings.\"    The fight begins. \"Bold Stayner leads\" and \"War turned the temperate to  the torrid zone\":--        \"Fate these two fleets, between both worlds, had brought      Who fight, as if for both those worlds they fought.      ...      ...      The all-seeing sun ne'er gazed on such a sight,      Two dreadful navies there at anchor fight,      And neither have, or power, or will, to fly;      There one must conquer, or there both must die.\"    Blake sinks the Spanish ships:--        \"Their galleons sunk, their wealth the sea does fill,      The only place where it can cause no ill\";    and the poet concludes:--        \"Ah! would those treasures which both Indias have      Were buried in as large, and deep a grave!      War's chief support with them would buried be,      And the land owe her peace unto the sea.      Ages to come your conquering arms will bless.      There they destroyed what had destroyed their peace;      And in one war the present age may boast,      The certain seeds of many wars are lost.\"    Good politics, if but second-rate poetry. This was the last time the  Spanish war-cry _Santiago, y cierra Espana_ rang in hostility in English  ears.    Turning for a moment from war to love, on the 19th of November 1657  Cromwell's third daughter, the Lady Mary Cromwell, was married to  Viscount, afterwards Earl, Fauconberg. The Fauconbergs took revolutions  calmly and, despite the disinterment of their great relative, accepted  the Restoration gladly and lived to chuckle over the Revolution. The  forgetfulness, no less than the vindictiveness, of men is often  surprising. Marvell, who played the part of Laureate during the  Protectorate, produced two songs for the conventionally joyful  occasion. The second of the two is decidedly pretty for a November  wedding:--        \"_Hobbinol._ PHILLIS, TOMALIN, away!                   Never such a merry day,                   For the northern shepherd's son                   Has MENALCAS' daughter won.        _Phillis._   Stay till I some flowers have tied                   In a garland for the bride.        _Tomalin._   If thou would'st a garland bring,                   PHILLIS, you may wait the spring:                   They have chosen such an hour                   When she is the only flower.        _Phillis._   Let's not then, at least, be seen                   Without each a sprig of green.        _Hobbinol._  Fear not; at MENALCAS' hall                   There are bays enough for all.                   He, when young as we, did graze,                   But when old he planted bays.        _Tomalin._   Here she comes; but with a look                   Far more catching than my hook;                   'Twas those eyes, I now dare swear,                   Led our lambs we knew not where.        _Hobbinol._  Not our lambs' own fleeces are                   Curled so lovely as her hair,                   Nor our sheep new-washed can be                   Half so white or sweet as she.        _Phillis._   He so looks as fit to keep                   Somewhat else than silly sheep.        _Hobbinol._  Come, let's in some carol new                   Pay to love and them their due.        _All._  Joy to that happy pair              Whose hopes united banish our despair.              What shepherd could for love pretend,              Whilst all the nymphs on Damon's choice attend?              What shepherdess could hope to wed              Before Marina's turn were sped?              Now lesser beauties may take place              And meaner virtues come in play;                      While they                  Looking from high                      Shall grace              Our flocks and us with a propitious eye.\"    All this merriment came to an end on the 3rd of September 1658, when  Oliver Cromwell died on the anniversary of Dunbar fight and of the field  of Worcester. And yet the end, though it was to be sudden, did not at  once seem likely to be so. There was time for the poets to tune their  lyres. Waller, Dryden, Sprat, and Marvell had no doubt that \"Tumbledown  Dick\" was to sit on the throne of his father and \"still keep the sword  erect,\" and were ready with their verses.    Westminster Abbey has never witnessed a statelier, costlier funeral than  that of \"the late man who made himself to be called Protector,\" to quote  words from one of the most impressive passages in English prose, the  opening sentences of Cowley's _Discourse by way of Vision concerning the  Government of Oliver Cromwell_. The representatives of kings,  potentates, and powers crowded the aisles, and all was done that pomp  and ceremony could do. Marvell, arrayed in the six yards of mourning the  Council had voted him on the 7th of September, was, we may be sure, in  the Abbey, and it may well be that his blind colleague, to whom the same  liberal allowance had been made, leant on his arm during the service.  Milton's muse remained silent. The vote of the House of Commons ordering  the undoing of this great ceremony was little more than two years ahead.  _O caeca mens hominum!_    Among the poems first printed by Captain Thompson from the old  manuscript book was one which was written therein in Marvell's own hand  entitled \"A poem upon the Death of his late Highness the Protector.\" Its  composition was evidently not long delayed:--        \"We find already what those omens mean,      Earth ne'er more glad nor Heaven more serene.      Cease now our griefs, calm peace succeeds a war,      Rainbows to storms, Richard to Oliver.\"    The lines best worth remembering in the poem are the following:--        \"I saw him dead: a leaden slumber lies,      And mortal sleep over those wakeful eyes;      Those gentle rays under the lids were fled,      Which through his looks that piercing sweetness shed;      That port, which so majestic was and strong,      Loose, and deprived of vigour, stretched along;      All withered, all discoloured, pale and wan,      How much another thing, no more that man!      O, human glory vain! O, Death! O, wings!      O, worthless world! O, transitory things!      Yet dwelt that greatness in his shape decayed,      That still though dead, greater than Death he laid,      And in his altered face you something feign      That threatens Death, he yet will live again.\"      FOOTNOTES:    [49:1] In 1659 Clarendon, then Sir Edward Hyde, and in Brussels, writing  to Sir Richard Fanshaw, says, \"You are the secretary of the Latin tongue  and I will mend the warrant you sent, and have it despatched as soon as  I hear again from you, but I must tell you the place in itself, if it be  not dignified by the person who hath some other qualification, is not to  be valued. There is no signet belongs to it, which can be only kept by a  Secretary of State, from whom the Latin Secretary always receives orders  and prepares no despatches without his direction, and hath only a fee of  a hundred pound a year. And therefore, except it hath been in the hands  of a person who hath had some other employment, it hath fallen to the  fortune of inconsiderable men as Weckerlin was the last\" (_Hist. MSS.  Com._, _Heathcote Papers_, 1899, p. 9).    [51:1] _The Rehearsal Transprosed_.--Grosart, iii. 126.    [55:1] Even Mr. Firth can tell me nothing about this Ward of Cromwell's.

The robin was tremendously busy. He was very much pleased to see  gardening begun on his own estate. He had often wondered at Ben  Weatherstaff. Where gardening is done all sorts of delightful things to  eat are turned up with the soil. Now here was this new kind of creature  who was not half Ben's size and yet had had the sense to come into his  garden and begin at once.    Mistress Mary worked in her garden until it was time to go to her midday  dinner. In fact, she was rather late in remembering, and when she put on  her coat and hat, and picked up her skipping-rope, she could not believe  that she had been working two or three hours. She had been actually  happy all the time; and dozens and dozens of the tiny, pale green points  were to be seen in cleared places, looking twice as cheerful as they had  looked before when the grass and weeds had been smothering them.    \"I shall come back this afternoon,\" she said, looking all round at her  new kingdom, and speaking to the trees and the rose-bushes as if they  heard her.    Then she ran lightly across the grass, pushed open the slow old door and  slipped through it under the ivy. She had such red cheeks and such  bright eyes and ate such a dinner that Martha was delighted.    \"Two pieces o' meat an' two helps o' rice puddin'!\" she said. \"Eh!  mother will be pleased when I tell her what th' skippin'-rope's done  for thee.\"    In the course of her digging with her pointed stick Mistress Mary had  found herself digging up a sort of white root rather like an onion. She  had put it back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on it  and just now she wondered if Martha could tell her what it was.    \"Martha,\" she said, \"what are those white roots that look like onions?\"    \"They're bulbs,\" answered Martha. \"Lots o' spring flowers grow from 'em.  Th' very little ones are snowdrops an' crocuses an' th' big ones are  narcissusis an' jonquils an' daffydowndillys. Th' biggest of all is  lilies an' purple flags. Eh! they are nice. Dickon's got a whole lot of  'em planted in our bit o' garden.\"    \"Does Dickon know all about them?\" asked Mary, a new idea taking  possession of her.    \"Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk. Mother says he  just whispers things out o' th' ground.\"    \"Do bulbs live a long time? Would they live years and years if no one  helped them?\" inquired Mary anxiously.    \"They're things as helps themselves,\" said Martha. \"That's why poor folk  can afford to have 'em. If you don't trouble 'em, most of 'em'll work  away underground for a lifetime an' spread out an' have little 'uns.  There's a place in th' park woods here where there's snowdrops by  thousands. They're the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when th' spring  comes. No one knows when they was first planted.\"    \"I wish the spring was here now,\" said Mary. \"I want to see all the  things that grow in England.\"    She had finished her dinner and gone to her favorite seat on the  hearth-rug.    \"I wish--I wish I had a little spade,\" she said.    \"Whatever does tha' want a spade for?\" asked Martha, laughing. \"Art tha'  goin' to take to diggin'? I must tell mother that, too.\"    Mary looked at the fire and pondered a little. She must be careful if  she meant to keep her secret kingdom. She wasn't doing any harm, but if  Mr. Craven found out about the open door he would be fearfully angry and  get a new key and lock it up forevermore. She really could not bear  that.    \"This is such a big lonely place,\" she said slowly, as if she were  turning matters over in her mind. \"The house is lonely, and the park is  lonely, and the gardens are lonely. So many places seem shut up. I never  did many things in India, but there were more people to look at--natives  and soldiers marching by--and sometimes bands playing, and my Ayah told  me stories. There is no one to talk to here except you and Ben  Weatherstaff. And you have to do your work and Ben Weatherstaff won't  speak to me often. I thought if I had a little spade I could dig  somewhere as he does, and I might make a little garden if he would give  me some seeds.\"    Martha's face quite lighted up.    \"There now!\" she exclaimed, \"if that wasn't one of th' things mother  said. She says, 'There's such a lot o' room in that big place, why don't  they give her a bit for herself, even if she doesn't plant nothin' but  parsley an' radishes? She'd dig an' rake away an' be right down happy  over it.' Them was the very words she said.\"    \"Were they?\" said Mary. \"How many things she knows, doesn't she?\"    \"Eh!\" said Martha. \"It's like she says: 'A woman as brings up twelve  children learns something besides her A B C. Children's as good as  'rithmetic to set you findin' out things.'\"    \"How much would a spade cost--a little one?\" Mary asked.    \"Well,\" was Martha's reflective answer, \"at Thwaite village there's a  shop or so an' I saw little garden sets with a spade an' a rake an' a  fork all tied together for two shillings. An' they was stout enough to  work with, too.\"    \"I've got more than that in my purse,\" said Mary. \"Mrs. Morrison gave  me five shillings and Mrs. Medlock gave me some money from Mr. Craven.\"    \"Did he remember thee that much?\" exclaimed Martha.    \"Mrs. Medlock said I was to have a shilling a week to spend. She gives  me one every Saturday. I didn't know what to spend it on.\"    \"My word! that's riches,\" said Martha. \"Tha' can buy anything in th'  world tha' wants. Th' rent of our cottage is only one an' threepence an'  it's like pullin' eye-teeth to get it. Now I've just thought of  somethin',\" putting her hands on her hips.    \"What?\" said Mary eagerly.    \"In the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o' flower-seeds for a penny  each, and our Dickon he knows which is th' prettiest ones an' how to  make 'em grow. He walks over to Thwaite many a day just for th' fun of  it. Does tha' know how to print letters?\" suddenly.    \"I know how to write,\" Mary answered.    Martha shook her head.    \"Our Dickon can only read printin'. If tha' could print we could write a  letter to him an' ask him to go an' buy th' garden tools an' th' seeds  at th' same time.\"    \"Oh! you're a good girl!\" Mary cried. \"You are, really! I didn't know  you were so nice. I know I can print letters if I try. Let's ask Mrs.  Medlock for a pen and ink and some paper.\"    \"I've got some of my own,\" said Martha. \"I bought 'em so I could print a  bit of a letter to mother of a Sunday. I'll go and get it.\"    She ran out of the room, and Mary stood by the fire and twisted her thin  little hands together with sheer pleasure.    \"If I have a spade,\" she whispered, \"I can make the earth nice and soft  and dig up weeds. If I have seeds and can make flowers grow the garden  won't be dead at all--it will come alive.\"    She did not go out again that afternoon because when Martha returned  with her pen and ink and paper she was obliged to clear the table and  carry the plates and dishes down-stairs and when she got into the  kitchen Mrs. Medlock was there and told her to do something, so Mary  waited for what seemed to her a long time before she came back. Then it  was a serious piece of work to write to Dickon. Mary had been taught  very little because her governesses had disliked her too much to stay  with her. She could not spell particularly well but she found that she  could print letters when she tried. This was the letter Martha dictated  to her:              \"_My Dear Dickon:_              This comes hoping to find you well as it leaves me            at present. Miss Mary has plenty of money and will            you go to Thwaite and buy her some flower seeds            and a set of garden tools to make a flower-bed.            Pick the prettiest ones and easy to grow because            she has never done it before and lived in India            which is different. Give my love to mother and            every one of you. Miss Mary is going to tell me a            lot more so that on my next day out you can hear            about elephants and camels and gentlemen going            hunting lions and tigers.                           \"Your loving sister,                                       \"MARTHA PHOEBE SOWERBY.\"    \"We'll put the money in th' envelope an' I'll get th' butcher's boy to  take it in his cart. He's a great friend o' Dickon's,\" said Martha.    \"How shall I get the things when Dickon buys them?\" asked Mary.    \"He'll bring 'em to you himself. He'll like to walk over this way.\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Mary, \"then I shall see him! I never thought I should  see Dickon.\"    \"Does tha' want to see him?\" asked Martha suddenly, she had looked so  pleased.    \"Yes, I do. I never saw a boy foxes and crows loved. I want to see him  very much.\"    Martha gave a little start, as if she suddenly remembered something.    \"Now to think,\" she broke out, \"to think o' me forgettin' that there;  an' I thought I was goin' to tell you first thing this mornin'. I asked  mother--and she said she'd ask Mrs. Medlock her own self.\"    \"Do you mean--\" Mary began.    \"What I said Tuesday. Ask her if you might be driven over to our cottage  some day and have a bit o' mother's hot oat cake, an' butter, an' a  glass o' milk.\"    It seemed as if all the interesting things were happening in one day. To  think of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was blue!  To think of going into the cottage which held twelve children!    \"Does she think Mrs. Medlock would let me go?\" she asked, quite  anxiously.    \"Aye, she thinks she would. She knows what a tidy woman mother is and  how clean she keeps the cottage.\"    \"If I went I should see your mother as well as Dickon,\" said Mary,  thinking it over and liking the idea very much. \"She doesn't seem to be  like the mothers in India.\"    Her work in the garden and the excitement of the afternoon ended by  making her feel quiet and thoughtful."]]]
