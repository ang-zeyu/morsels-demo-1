But this childish pleasure seemed sinful to me, and I had so many  scruples that I had to go to Confession, even at Trouville.    While I was there I had an experience which did me good. My cousin  Marie often suffered from sick headaches. On these occasions my  aunt used to fondle her and coax her with the most endearing  names, but the only response was continual tears and the unceasing  cry: \"My head aches!\" I had a headache nearly every day, though I  did not say so; but one evening I thought I would imitate Marie.  So I sat down in an armchair in a corner of the room, and set to  work to cry. My aunt, as well as my cousin Jeanne, to whom I was  very devoted, hastened to me to know what was the matter. I  answered like Marie: \"My head aches.\" It would seem that  complaining was not in my line; no one would believe that a  headache was the reason of my tears. Instead of petting me as  usual, my aunt spoke to me seriously. Even Jeanne reproached me,  very kindly it is true, and was grieved at my want of simplicity  and trust in my aunt. She thought I had a big scruple, and was not  giving the real reason of my tears. At last, getting nothing for  my pains, I made up my mind not to imitate other people any more.  I thought of the fable of the ass and the little dog; I was the  ass, who, seeing that the little dog got all the petting, put his  clumsy hoof on the table to try and secure his share. If I did not  have a beating like the poor beast, at any rate I got what I  deserved--a severe lesson, which cured me once for all of the  desire to attract attention.    I must go back now to the subject of my scruples. They made me so  ill that I was obliged to leave school when I was thirteen. In  order to continue my education, Papa took me several times a week  to a lady who was an excellent teacher. Her lessons served the  double purpose of instructing me and making me associate with  other people.    Visitors were often shown into the old-fashioned room where I sat  with my books and exercises. As far as possible my teacher's  mother carried on the conversation, but still I did not learn much  while it lasted. Seemingly absorbed in my book, I could hear many  things it would have been better for me not to hear. One lady said  I had beautiful hair; another asked, as she left, who was that  pretty little girl. Such remarks, the more flattering because I  was not meant to hear them, gave me a feeling of pleasure which  showed plainly that I was full of self-love.    I am very sorry for souls who lose themselves in this way. It is  so easy to go astray in the seductive paths of the world. Without  doubt, for a soul somewhat advanced in virtue, the sweetness  offered by the world is mingled with bitterness, and the immense  void of its desires cannot be filled by the flattery of a moment;  but I repeat, if my heart had not been lifted up towards God from  the first moment of consciousness, if the world had smiled on me  from the beginning of my life, what should I have become? Dearest  Mother, with what a grateful heart do I sing \"the Mercies of the  Lord!\" Has He not, according to the words of Holy Wisdom, \"taken  me away from the world lest wickedness should alter my  understanding, or deceit beguile my soul?\"[11]    Meanwhile I resolved to consecrate myself in a special way to Our  Blessed Lady, and I begged to be enrolled among the Children of  Mary.[12] To gain this favour I had to go twice a week to the  Convent, and I must confess this cost me something, I was so shy.  There was no question of the affection I felt towards my  mistresses, but, as I said before, I had no special friend among  them, with whom I could have spent many hours like other old  pupils. So I worked in silence till the end of the lesson, and  then, as no one took any notice of me, I went to the tribune in  the Chapel till Papa came to fetch me home. Here, during this  silent visit, I found my one consolation--for was not Jesus my  only Friend? To Him alone could I open my heart; all conversation  with creatures, even on holy subjects, wearied me. It is true that  in these periods of loneliness I sometimes felt sad, and I used  often to console myself by repeating this line of a beautiful poem  Papa had taught me: \"Time is thy barque, and not thy  dwelling-place.\"    Young as I was, these words restored my courage, and even now, in  spite of having outgrown many pious impressions of childhood, the  symbol of a ship always delights me and helps me to bear the exile  of this life. Does not the Wise Man tell us--\"Life is like a ship  that passeth through the waves: when it is gone by, the trace  thereof cannot be found\"?[13]    When my thoughts run on in this way, my soul loses itself as it  were in the infinite; I seem already to touch the Heavenly Shore  and to receive Our Lord's embrace. I fancy I can see Our Blessed  Lady coming to meet me, with my Father and Mother, my little  brothers and sisters; and I picture myself enjoying true family  joys for all eternity.    But before reaching Our Father's Home in Heaven, I had to go  through many partings on this earth. The year in which I was made  a Child of Mary, Our Lady took from me my sister Marie, the only  support of my soul,[14] my oracle and inseparable companion since  the departure of Pauline. As soon as I knew of her decision, I  made up my mind to take no further pleasure in anything here  below. I could not tell you how many tears I shed. But at this  time I was much given to crying, not only over big things, but  over trifling ones too. For instance: I was very anxious to  advance in virtue, but I went about it in a strange way. I was not  accustomed to wait on myself; Celine always arranged our room, and  I never did any household work. Sometimes, in order to please Our  Lord, I used to make my bed, or, if she were out in the evening,  to bring in her plants and seedlings. As I said before, it was  simply to please Our Lord that I did these things, and so I ought  not to have expected any thanks from creatures. But, alas! I did  expect them, and, if unfortunately Celine did not seem surprised  and grateful for my little services, I was not pleased, and tears  rose to my eyes.    Again, if by accident I offended anyone, instead of taking it in  the right way, I fretted till I made myself ill, thus making my  fault worse, instead of mending it; and when I began to realise my  foolishness, I would cry for having cried.    In fact, I made troubles out of everything. Now, things are quite  different. God in His goodness has given me grace not to be cast  down by any passing difficulty. When I think of what I used to be,  my heart overflows with gratitude. The graces I have received have  changed me so completely, that I am scarcely the same person.    After Marie entered the Carmel, and I no longer had her to listen  to my scruples, I turned towards Heaven and confided them to the  four little angels who had already gone before me, for I thought  that these innocent souls, who had never known sorrow or fear,  ought to have pity on their poor little suffering sister. I talked  to them with childish simplicity, telling them that, as I was the  youngest of the family, I had always been the most petted and  loved by my parents and sisters; that if they had remained on  earth they would no doubt have given me the same proofs of their  affection. The fact that they had gone to Heaven seemed no reason  why they should forget me--on the contrary, as they were able to  draw form the treasury of Heaven, they ought to obtain for me the  grace of peace, and prove that they still knew how to love me.    The answer was not long in coming; soon my soul was flooded with  the sweetest peace. I knew that I was loved, not only on earth but  also in Heaven. From that time my devotion for these little  brothers and sisters increased; I loved to talk to them and tell  them of all the sorrows of this exile, and of my wish to join them  soon in our Eternal Home.  ______________________________    [1] Cf.

I had a constant and ardent desire to advance in virtue, but  often my actions were spoilt by imperfections. My extreme  sensitiveness made me almost unbearable. All arguments were  useless. I simply could not correct myself of this miserable  fault. How, then, could I hope soon to be admitted to the Carmel?  A miracle on a small scale was needed to give me strength of  character all at once, and God worked this long-desired miracle on  Christmas Day, 1886.    On that blessed night the sweet Infant Jesus, scarce an hour old,  filled the darkness of my soul with floods of light. By becoming  weak and little, for love of me, He made me strong and brave; He  put His own weapons into my hands, so that I went from victory to  victory, beginning, if I may say so, \"to run as a giant.\"[1] The  fountain of my tears was dried up, and from that time they flowed  neither easily nor often.

The process must not be carried too far, but as  soon as the bubbles disappear the lamp should be removed, and the plate  immersed in distilled water, and dried as before directed.    7th. COLORING THE PICTURE.--I very much doubt the propriety of coloring  the daguerreotypes, as I am of opinion, that they are little, if any,  improved by the operation, at least as it is now generally practised.    There are several things requisite in an artist to enable him to color  a head, or even a landscape effectively, and correctly, and I must say  that very few of these are possessed by our operators as a class.  These requirements are, a talent for drawing--taste--due discrimination  of effect--strict observance of the characteristic points in the  features of the subject--quick perception of the beautiful, and a  knowledge of the art of mixing colors, and blending tints.    The method now pursued, I do not hesitate to say, and have no fears of  being contradicted by those capable of critisizing is on the whole  ruinous to any daguerreotype, and to a perfect one absolutely  disgusting.  The day may come when accurate coloring may be obtained in  the camera.  Until that day, if we cannot lead taste into the right  channel, we will endeavor to give such instructions that  Daguerreotypists may proceed with this part of his work with a better  understanding of the principles involved.  For this purpose I have  prepared a short chapter on the art of coloring, which may be found in  the latter part of this volume.    To Preserve Daguerreotypes they must be well sealed and secured in a  case, or frame.  These, of course, are selected according to the taste  of the customer, the principal requisite being good glass.  Most  Daguerreotypists prefer the white French plate glass--and many think,  very erroneously, that none is good unless it is thick--but the great  desideratum is clearness and freedom from blisters; even glass a little  tinged with green or yellow is to be preferred to the French plate when  cloudy or blistered and there is very little of it comes to this market  that is not so.  It is to be hoped that some of our glass factories  will manage to manufacture an article expressly for daguerreotypes; and  I would recommend them to do so, for they would find it quite an item  of profit annually.    Before enclosing the picture in the case you should be careful to wipe  the glass perfectly clean, and blow from the picture any particles of  dust which may have fallen upon it.  Then take strips of sticking  paper, about half or three quarters of an inch wide, and firmly and  neatly secure it to the glass, having first placed a \"mat\" between them  to prevent the plate being scratched by the glass.    TO MAKE SEALING PAPER.--Dissolve one ounce of gum arabic, and a quarter  of an ounce of gum tragicanth in a pint of water; then add a  teaspoonful of benzoin.  Spread this evenly on one side of good stout  tissue paper; let it dry, and then cut it up in stripes, about half or  three quarters of an inch wide, for use.  If it becomes too soft for  summer use, add gum arabic; if too hard and cracking, add benzoin or  gum tragicanth; if it gets too thick, add water.    COLORED DAGUERREOTYPES ON COPPER.--To effect this, take a polished  plate of copper and expose it to the vapor of iodine, or bromine, or  the two substances combined; or either of them in combination with  chlorine.  This gives a sensitive coating to the surface of the plate,  which may then be submitted to the action of light in the camera.  After remaining a sufficient time in the camera, the plate is taken out  and exposed to the vapor of sulphuretted hydrogen.  This vapor produces  various colors on the plate, according to the intensity with which the  light has acted on the different parts; consequently a colored  photographic picture is obtained.  No further process is necessary as  exposure to light does not effect the picture.    By this process we have an advantage over the silvered plate, both in  economy, and in the production of the picture in colors.    INSTANTANEOUS PICTURES BY MEANS OF GALVANISM.--It will be seen by the  following valuable communication that galvanism can be successfully  applied in producing pictures instantly; a process of great importance  in securing the likeness of a child, or in taking views of animated  nature.  Colonel Whitney informs me that he once took a view of the  steeple of the St. Louis Court House after sundown by this means, and  also secured the image of a man in the act of stepping into a store,  and before he had time to place his foot, raised for that purpose, on  the door step.  Mr. Whitney is well known as the talented editor of the  Sunday Morning news.            New York, January 16, 1849.    Mr. H. H. SNELLING.    Dear Sir,--As you are about publishing a history of the Daguerreotype,  and request a description of my mode of taking pictures instantaneously  by the aid of galvanism, I comply with great pleasure.    In the year 1841, while practicing the art in St. Louis, Mo., I was at  times, during the summer, much troubled with the electric influence of  the atmosphere, especially on the approach of a thunder-storm. At such  times I found the coating of my plates much more sensitive than when  the atmosphere was comparatively free from the electric fluid, and the  effect was so irregular that no calculation could counteract the  difficulty.  This satisfied me that electricity was in some measure an  important agent in the chemical process, and it occurred to me that the  element might be turned to advantage.  I determined, therefore, to  enter on a series of experiments to test my theory.  Finding it  impossible to obtain an electric machine, and unwilling to abandon the  examination, it occurred to me, that the galvanic influence might  answer the same purpose.  I therefore proceeded to make a galvanic  battery in the following simple manner.  I obtained a piece of zinc  about two inches long, one inch wide, and an eighth of an inch thick.  On this I soldered a narrow strip of copper, about six inches long, the  soldered end laid on one side of the zinc, and extending its whole  length.  The battery was completed by placing the zinc in a glass  tumbler, two-thirds full of dilute sulphuric acid, strong enough to  produce a free action of the metals.  The upper end of the copper slip  extending above the tumbler was sharpened to a point, and bent a little  over the glass.    The method of using, was thus:--After preparing the plate in the usual  manner and placing it in the camera, in such manner as to expose the  back of the plate to view, the battery was prepared by placing the zinc  in the acid, and as soon as the galvanic fluid began to traverse (as  could be known by the effervescence of the acid, operating on the zinc  and copper) the cap of the camera was removed, and the plate exposed to  the sitter; at the same instant the point of the battery was brought  quickly against the back of the plate, and the cap replaced instantly.  If the plate is exposed more than an instant after the contact the  picture will generally be found solarized.  By this process I have  taken pictures of persons in the act of walking, and in taking the  pictures of infants and young children I found it very useful.      Very respectfully yours,    THOMAS R. WHITNEY.        CHAP. VII    PAPER DAGUERREOTYPES.--ETCHING DAGUERREOTYPES.      Mr. Hunt describes a process, discovered by himself by which the  Daguerrean art may be applied to paper.  His description is as  follows:--    \"Placing the paper on some hard body, wash it over on one side--by  means of a very soft camel's hair pencil--with a solution of sixty  grains of bromide of potassium, in two fluid ounces of distilled water,  and then dry it quickly by the fire.  Being dry, it is again washed  over with the same solution, and dried as before.  A solution of  nitrate of silver--one hundred grains to an ounce of distilled  water--is to be applied over the same surface, and the paper quickly  dried in the dark.  In this state the papers may be kept for use.    \"When they are required, the above solution of silver is to be  plentifully applied, and the paper placed wet in the camera, the  greatest care being taken that no day light--not even the faintest  gleam--falls upon it until the moment when you are prepared, by  removing the dark slide, to permit the light, radiating from the object  you wish to copy, to act in producing the picture.  After a few seconds  the light must be again shut off, and the camera removed into a dark  room.\" The necessity of removing the camera is now avoided by the use  of the dark slide, already described, covering the picture in the  holder, which alone may be removed.--Amer. Aut.    \"It will be found by taking the paper from the holder, that there is  but a very faint outline--if any--yet visible.  Place it aside, in  perfect darkness until quite dry; then place it in the mercurial vapor  box (meaning bath) and apply a very gentle heat to the bottom.  The  moment the mercury vaporizes, the picture will begin to develope  itself.  The spirit lamp must now be removed for a short time, and when  the action of the mercury appears to cease, it is to be very carefully  applied again, until a well defined picture is visible.  The  vaporization must then be suddenly stopped, and the photograph removed  from the box.  The drawing will then be very beautiful and distinct;  but much detail is still clouded, for the developement of which it is  only necessary to place it in the dark and suffer it to remain  undisturbed for some hours.  There is now an inexpressible charm about  the pictures, equaling the delicate beauty of the daguerreotype; but  being very susceptible of change, it must be viewed by the light of a  taper only.  The nitrate of silver must now be removed from the paper,  by well washing it in soft water, to which a "]]]
