O yes--I find great use in that Screen.    SIR PETER. I dare say you must--certainly--when you want to find out  anything in a Hurry.    SURFACE. Aye or to hide anything in a Hurry either--    SIR PETER. Well I have a little private Business--if we were alone--    SURFACE. You needn't stay.    SERVANT. No--Sir----         [Exit SERVANT.]    SURFACE. Here's a Chair--Sir Peter--I beg----    SIR PETER. Well--now we are alone--there IS a subject--my dear  Friend--on which I wish to unburthen my Mind to you--a Point of the  greatest moment to my Peace--in short, my good Friend--Lady Teazle's  conduct of late has made me very unhappy.    SURFACE. Indeed I'm very sorry to hear it--    SIR PETER. Yes 'tis but too plain she has not the least regard for  me--but what's worse, I have pretty good Authority to suspect that she  must have formed an attachment to another.    SURFACE. Indeed! you astonish me.    SIR PETER. Yes--and between ourselves--I think I have discover'd the  Person.    SURFACE. How--you alarm me exceedingly!    SIR PETER. Ah: my dear Friend I knew you would sympathize with me.--    SURFACE. Yes--believe me Sir Peter--such a discovery would hurt me just  as much as it would you--    SIR PETER. I am convinced of it--ah--it is a happiness to have a Friend  whom one can trust even with one's Family secrets--but have you no guess  who I mean?    SURFACE. I haven't the most distant Idea--it can't be Sir Benjamin  Backbite.    SIR PETER. O--No. What say you to Charles?    SURFACE. My Brother--impossible!--O no Sir Peter you mustn't credit the  scandalous insinuations you hear--no no--Charles to be sure has been  charged with many things but go I can never think He would meditate so  gross an injury--    SIR PETER. Ah! my dear Friend--the goodness of your own Heart misleads  you--you judge of others by yourself.    SURFACE. Certainly Sir Peter--the Heart that is conscious of its own  integrity is ever slowest to credit another's Treachery.--    SIR PETER. True--but your Brother has no sentiment[--]you never hear him  talk so.--    SURFACE. Well there certainly is no knowing what men are capable  of--no--there is no knowing--yet I can't but think Lady Teazle herself  has too much Principle----    SIR PETER. Aye but what's Principle against the Flattery of a  handsome--lively young Fellow--    SURFACE. That's very true--    SIR PETER. And then you know the difference of our ages makes it very  improbable that she should have any great affection for me--and if she  were to be frail and I were to make it Public--why the Town would only  laugh at the foolish old Batchelor, who had married a girl----    SURFACE. That's true--to be sure People would laugh.    SIR PETER. Laugh--aye and make Ballads--and Paragraphs and the Devil  knows what of me--    SURFACE. No--you must never make it public--    SIR PETER. But then again that the Nephew of my old Friend, Sir  Oliver[,] should be the Person to attempt such an injury--hurts me more  nearly--    SURFACE. Undoubtedly--when Ingratitude barbs the Dart of Injury--the  wound has double danger in it--    SIR PETER. Aye--I that was in a manner left his Guardian--in his House  he had been so often entertain'd--who never in my Life denied him my  advice--    SURFACE. O 'tis not to be credited--There may be a man capable of such  Baseness, to be sure--but for my Part till you can give me positive  Proofs you must excuse me withholding my Belief. However, if this should  be proved on him He is no longer a brother of mine I disclaim kindred  with him--for the man who can break thro' the Laws of Hospitality--and  attempt the wife of his Friend deserves to be branded as the Pest of  Society.    SIR PETER. What a difference there is between you--what noble  sentiments!--    SURFACE. But I cannot suspect Lady Teazle's honor.    SIR PETER. I'm sure I wish to think well of her--and to remove all  ground of Quarrel between us--She has lately reproach'd me more than  once with having made no settlement on her--and, in our last Quarrel,  she almost hinted that she should not break her Heart if I was  dead.--now as we seem to differ in our Ideas of Expense I have resolved  she shall be her own Mistress in that Respect for the future--and if  I were to die--she shall find that I have not been inattentive to her  Interests while living--Here my Friend are the Draughts of two Deeds  which I wish to have your opinion on--by one she will enjoy eight  hundred a year independent while I live--and by the other the bulk of my  Fortune after my Death.    SURFACE. This conduct Sir Peter is indeed truly Generous! I wish it may  not corrupt my pupil.--[Aside.]    SIR PETER. Yes I am determined she shall have no cause to complain--tho'  I would not have her acquainted with the latter instance of my affection  yet awhile.    SURFACE. Nor I--if I could help it.    SIR PETER. And now my dear Friend if you please we will talk over the  situation of your Hopes with Maria.    SURFACE. No--no--Sir Peter--another Time if you Please--[softly].    SIR PETER. I am sensibly chagrined at the little Progress you seem to  make in her affection.    SURFACE. I beg you will not mention it--What are my Disappointments when  your Happiness is in Debate [softly]. 'Sdeath I shall be ruined every  way.    SIR PETER. And tho' you are so averse to my acquainting Lady Teazle with  YOUR passion, I am sure she's not your Enemy in the Affair.    SURFACE. Pray Sir Peter, now oblige me.--I am really too much affected  by the subject we have been speaking of to bestow a thought on my own  concerns--The Man who is entrusted with his Friend's Distresses can  never----         Enter SERVANT    Well, Sir?    SERVANT. Your Brother Sir, is--speaking to a Gentleman in the Street,  and says He knows you're within.    SURFACE. 'Sdeath, Blockhead--I'm NOT within--I'm out for the Day.    SIR PETER. Stay--hold--a thought has struck me--you shall be at home.    SURFACE. Well--well--let him up.--         [Exit SERVANT.]    He'll interrupt Sir Peter, however. [Aside.]    SIR PETER. Now, my good Friend--oblige me I Intreat you--before Charles  comes--let me conceal myself somewhere--Then do you tax him on the Point  we have been talking on--and his answers may satisfy me at once.--    SURFACE. O Fie--Sir Peter--would you have ME join in so mean a Trick? to  trepan my Brother too?    SIR PETER. Nay you tell me you are SURE He is innocent--if so you do  him the greatest service in giving him an opportunity to clear  himself--and--you will set my Heart at rest--come you shall not refuse  me--here behind this Screen will be--hey! what the Devil--there seems to  be one listener here already--I'll swear I saw a Petticoat.--    SURFACE. Ha! ha! ha! Well this is ridiculous enough--I'll tell you,  Sir Peter--tho' I hold a man of Intrigue to be a most despicable  Character--yet you know it doesn't follow that a man is to be an  absolute Joseph either--hark'ee--'tis a little French Milliner--a silly  Rogue that plagues me--and having some character, on your coming she ran  behind the Screen.--    SIR PETER. Ah a Rogue--but 'egad she has overheard all I have been  saying of my Wife.    SURFACE. O 'twill never go any farther, you may depend on't.    SIR PETER. No!--then efaith let her hear it out.--Here's a Closet will  do as well.--    SURFACE. Well, go in there.--    SIR PETER. Sly rogue--sly Rogue.--    SURFACE. Gad's my Life what an Escape--! and a curious situation I'm  in!--to part man and wife in this manner.--    LADY TEAZLE. [peeps out.] Couldn't I steal off--    SURFACE. Keep close, my Angel!    SIR PETER. [Peeping out.] Joseph--tax him home.    SURFACE. Back--my dear Friend    LADY TEAZLE. [Peeping out.] Couldn't you lock Sir Peter in?--    SURFACE. Be still--my Life!    SIR PETER. [Peeping.] You're sure the little Milliner won't blab?    SURFACE. In! in! my good Sir Peter--'Fore Gad, I wish I had a key to the  Door.         Enter CHARLES    CHARLES. Hollo! Brother--what has been the matter? your Fellow wouldn't  let me up at first--What[?] have you had a Jew or a wench with you.--    SURFACE. Neither Brother I assure you.    CHARLES. But--what has made Sir Peter steal off--I thought He had been  with you--    SURFACE. He WAS Brother--but hearing you were coming He didn't chuse to  stay--    CHARLES. What[!] was the old Gentleman afraid I wanted to borrow money  of him?    SURFACE. No Sir--but I am sorry to find[,] Charles--you have lately  given that worthy man grounds for great Uneasiness.    CHARLES. Yes they tell me I do that to a great many worthy men--but how  so Pray?    SURFACE. To be plain with you Brother He thinks you are endeavouring to  gain Lady Teazle's Affections from him.    CHARLES. Who I--O Lud! not I upon my word.--Ha! ha! ha! so the old  Fellow has found out that He has got a young wife has He? or what's  worse she has discover'd that she has an old Husband?    SURFACE. This is no subject to jest on Brother--He who can laugh----    CHARLES. True true as you were going to say--then seriously I never had  the least idea of what you charge me with, upon my honour.    SURFACE. Well it will give Sir Peter great satisfaction to hear this.    CHARLES. [Aloud.] To be sure, I once thought the lady seemed to  have taken a fancy--but upon my soul I never gave her the least  encouragement.--Beside you know my Attachment to Maria--    SURFACE. But sure Brother even if Lady Teazle had betray'd the fondest  Partiality for you----    CHARLES. Why--look'ee Joseph--I hope I shall never deliberately do  a dishonourable Action--but if a pretty woman was purposely to throw  herself in my way--and that pretty woman married to a man old enough to  be her Father----    SURFACE. Well?    CHARLES.

Does not Baha'u'llah Himself allude to the progressiveness of Divine  Revelation and to the limitations which an inscrutable Wisdom has chosen  to impose upon Him? What else can this passage of the Hidden Words imply,  if not that He Who revealed it disclaimed finality for the Revelation  entrusted to Him by the Almighty? \"O Son of Justice! In the night-season  the beauty of the immortal Being hath repaired from the emerald height of  fidelity unto the Sadratu'l-Muntaha, and wept with such a weeping that the  concourse on high and the dwellers of the realms above wailed at His  lamenting. Whereupon there was asked, Why the wailing and weeping? He made  reply: As bidden I waited expectant upon the hill of faithfulness, yet  inhaled not from them that dwell on earth the fragrance of fidelity. Then  summoned to return I beheld, and lo! certain doves of holiness were sore  tried within the claws of the dogs of earth. Thereupon the Maid of Heaven  hastened forth, unveiled, and resplendent, from Her mystic mansion, and  asked of their names, and all were told but one. And when urged, the first  Letter thereof was uttered, whereupon the dwellers of the celestial  chambers rushed forth out of their habitation of glory. And whilst the  second letter was pronounced they fell down, one and all, upon the dust.  At that moment a Voice was heard from the inmost shrine: 'Thus far and no  farther.' Verily we bear witness to that which they have done and now are  doing.\"    \"The Revelation of which I am the bearer,\" Baha'u'llah explicitly  declares, \"is adapted to humanity's spiritual receptiveness and capacity;  otherwise, the Light that shines within me can neither wax nor wane.  Whatever I manifest is nothing more or less than the measure of the Divine  glory which God has bidden me reveal.\"    If the Light that is now streaming forth upon an increasingly responsive  humanity with a radiance that bids fair to eclipse the splendor of such  triumphs as the forces of religion have achieved in days past; if the  signs and tokens which proclaimed its advent have been, in many respects,  unique in the annals of past Revelations; if its votaries have evinced  traits and qualities unexampled in the spiritual history of mankind; these  should be attributed not to a superior merit which the Faith of  Baha'u'llah, as a Revelation isolated and alien from any previous  Dispensation, might possess, but rather should be viewed and explained as  the inevitable outcome of the forces that have made of this present age an  age infinitely more advanced, more receptive, and more insistent to  receive an ampler measure of Divine Guidance than has hitherto been  vouchsafed to mankind.          Necessity for a Fresh Revelation      Dearly beloved friends: Who, contemplating the helplessness, the fears and  miseries of humanity in this day, can any longer question the necessity  for a fresh revelation of the quickening power of God's redemptive love  and guidance? Who, witnessing on one hand the stupendous advance achieved  in the realm of human knowledge, of power, of skill and inventiveness, and  viewing on the other the unprecedented character of the sufferings that  afflict, and the dangers that beset, present-day society, can be so blind  as to doubt that the hour has at last struck for the advent of a new  Revelation, for a re-statement of the Divine Purpose, and for the  consequent revival of those spiritual forces that have, at fixed  intervals, rehabilitated the fortunes of human society? Does not the very  operation of the world-unifying forces that are at work in this age  necessitate that He Who is the Bearer of the Message of God in this day  should not only reaffirm that self-same exalted standard of individual  conduct inculcated by the Prophets gone before Him, but embody in His  appeal, to all governments and peoples, the essentials of that social  code, that Divine Economy, which must guide humanity's concerted efforts  in establishing that all-embracing federation which is to signalize the  advent of the Kingdom of God on this earth?    May we not, therefore, recognizing as we do the necessity for such a  revelation of God's redeeming power, meditate upon the supreme grandeur of  the System unfolded by the hand of Baha'u'llah in this day? May we not  pause, pressed though we be by the daily preoccupations which the  ever-widening range of the administrative activities of His Faith must  involve, to reflect upon the sanctity of the responsibilities it is our  privilege to shoulder?          The Station of the Bab      Not only in the character of the revelation of Baha'u'llah, however  stupendous be His claim, does the greatness of this Dispensation reside.  For among the distinguishing features of His Faith ranks, as a further  evidence of its uniqueness, the fundamental truth that in the person of  its Forerunner, the Bab, every follower of Baha'u'llah recognizes not  merely an inspired annunciator but a direct Manifestation of God. It is  their firm belief that, no matter how short the duration of His  Dispensation, and however brief the period of the operation of His laws,  the Bab had been endowed with a potency such as no founder of any of the  past religions was, in the providence of the Almighty, allowed to possess.  That He was not merely the precursor of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah,  that He was more than a divinely-inspired personage, that His was the  station of an independent, self-sufficient Manifestation of God, is  abundantly demonstrated by Himself, is affirmed in unmistakable terms by  Baha'u'llah, and is finally attested by the Will and Testament of  'Abdu'l-Baha.    Nowhere but in the Kitab-i-Iqan, Baha'u'llah's masterly exposition of the  one unifying truth underlying all the Revelations of the past, can we  obtain a clearer apprehension of the potency of those forces inherent in  that Preliminary Manifestation with which His own Faith stands  indissolubly associated. Expatiating upon the unfathomed import of the  signs and tokens that have accompanied the Revelation proclaimed by the  Bab, the promised Qa'im, He recalls these prophetic words: \"Knowledge is  twenty and seven letters. All that the Prophets have revealed are two  letters thereof. No man thus far hath known more than these two letters.  But when the Qa'im shall arise, He will cause the remaining twenty and  five letters to be made manifest.\" \"Behold,\" adds Baha'u'llah, \"how great  and lofty is His station!\" \"Of His Revelation,\" He further adds, \"the  Prophets of God, His saints and chosen ones, have either not been  informed, or in pursuance of God's inscrutable Decree, they have not  disclosed.\"    And yet, immeasurably exalted as is the station of the Bab, and marvellous  as have been the happenings that have signalized the advent of His Cause,  so wondrous a Revelation cannot but pale before the effulgence of that Orb  of unsurpassed splendor Whose rise He foretold and whose superiority He  readily acknowledged. We have but to turn to the writings of the Bab  Himself in order to estimate the significance of that Quintessence of  Light of which He, with all the majesty of His power, was but its humble  and chosen Precursor.    Again and again the Bab admits, in glowing and unequivocal language, the  preeminent character of a Faith destined to be made manifest after Him and  to supersede His Cause. \"The germ,\" He asserts in the Persian Bayan, the  chief and best-preserved repository of His laws, \"that holds within itself  the potentialities of the Revelation that is to come is endowed with a  potency superior to the combined forces of all those who follow me.\" \"Of  all the tributes,\" the Bab repeatedly proclaims in His writings, \"I have  paid to Him Who is to come after Me, the greatest is this, My written  confession, that no words of Mine can adequately describe Him, nor can any  reference to Him in my Book, the Bayan, do justice to His Cause.\"  Addressing Siyyid Yahyay-i-Darabi, surnamed Vahid, the most learned and  influential among his followers, He says: \"By the righteousness of Him  Whose power causeth the seed to germinate and Who breatheth the spirit of  life into all things, were I to be assured that in the day of His  Manifestation thou wilt deny Him, I would unhesitatingly disown thee and  repudiate thy faith.... If, on the other hand, I be told that a Christian,  who beareth no allegiance to My Faith, will believe in Him, the same will  I regard as the apple of Mine eye.\"          The Outpouring of Divine Grace      \"If all the peoples of the world,\" Baha'u'llah Himself affirms, \"be  invested with the powers and attributes destined for the Letters of the  Living, the chosen disciples of the Bab, whose station is ten thousand  times more glorious than any which the apostles of old have attained, and  if they, one and all, should, swift as the twinkling of an eye, hesitate  to recognize the Light of my Revelation, their faith shall be of no avail,  and they shall be accounted among the infidels.\" \"So tremendous,\" He  writes, \"is the outpouring of Divine grace in this Dispensation that if  mortal hands could be swift enough to record them, within the space of a  single day and night, there would stream verses of such number as to be  equivalent to the whole of the Persian Bayan.\"    Such, dearly-beloved friends, is the effusion of celestial grace  vouchsafed by the Almighty to this age, this most illumined century! We  stand too close to so colossal a Revelation to expect in this, the first  century of its era, to arrive at a just estimate of its towering grandeur,  its infinite possibilities, its transcendent beauty. Small though our  present numbers may be, however limited our capacities,"]]]
