The Indians, however, in the other parts  of the country were not discouraged, and they surrounded an escort,  and slew about eighty officers and men near the falls of Niagara. Thus  disheartened, General Amherst used the powerful influence of Sir William  Johnstone, who was enabled to detach the Indians of the Six Nations  from the confederacy, and to engage them on the side of the British,  and after various skirmishes and surprises, the rest submitted on  conditions, or retired into the depths of their native wilds and  forests. In the treaty concluded with them all occasions of future  quarrels were guarded against; the limits of their territories were  accurately defined; their past offences forgiven; and they were  re-admitted to the friendship of Great Britain: the Indians on their  part solemnly engaging to commit no more acts of violence.    These occurrences had for the most part happened in the summer and  autumn of the year 1763. But the recollection of them was, from their  very nature, strongly impressed upon the minds of the colonists, when  they heard of the system proposed for their taxation. Moreover, every  one was armed for the defence of his home and property against the  Indians, and being now freed from their terrors in that quarter, they  were bold to think that they might be used against their mother-country,  should the scheme of colonial taxation not be abandoned. Hence the  colonists made a show of resistance by passing strong resolutions  against the measure, which were transmitted to their agents in London,  to be laid before government. The province of Pennsylvania appointed a  new agent to London, in the person of the celebrated Benjamin Franklin,  who was instructed to oppose the stamp-act to the very utmost, and  indeed every other act that might be proposed to the British parliament  to tax the Americans without their consent. A more efficient agent  than Franklin could not have been chosen by the Pennsylvanians. Born in  humble life, he had, nevertheless, raised himself by genius and steady  perseverance, to be a man of property and science, a leading magistrate,  a high functionary in their state, a powerful writer, a statesman, and a  philosopher.          DOMESTIC OCCURRENCES.    The measures of the new administration were generally approved of in the  house of commons, and on dismissing the parliament the king thanked  the members of both houses for their wise and spirited exertions,  and exhorted them all to employ the present season of tranquillity in  perfecting the peace so happily commenced. There was occasion for this  exhortation. The cider-tax occasioned many turbulent meetings, which  frequently ended in riot, and a great scarcity of provisions caused  an increase of robberies and crime to a large amount. These evils were  augmented by the discharge of large bodies of soldiers and sailors,  who either could not find employment, or from their previous occupation  could not settle down into habits of industry. Moreover, country  gentlemen and landed proprietors from all parts of the United Kingdom  came to the metropolis, in order to gain posts under government, leaving  their estates to be managed by stewards and bailiffs, the results of  which were that they involved themselves in debt, and that they  raised their rents for the purpose of relieving themselves. Discontent  everywhere prevailed, and especially in Scotland and Ireland, and many  thousands emigrated to the North American provinces, that they might be  able to obtain a subsistence for their families, and at the same time  preserve their religion and the customs of their fathers.    This year was marked by many maritime discoveries. A spirit of  enterprize, fostered by the munificence of the king, was displayed,  indeed, equal to that which distinguished the 15th and 16th centuries,  and which produced advantages to the country of equal importance to  those produced by the recent war. Byron, Wallis, Carteret, Cook, and  Mulgrave, all set sail during this year, and in a few years discoveries  were made which outrivalled all which had occurred since the expeditions  of Columbus.    During this autumn Pitt broke his recently-formed league with the old  Duke of Newcastle, telling him in a letter that he resolved henceforward  to act for himself, to keep himself free from all stipulations, and to  oppose or support measures in parliament upon his own responsibility. It  is not clear why Pitt came to this resolution; but perhaps it may  have arisen from his growing infirmity of body and temper, and of his  overbearing pride. From his letter, in fact, it is made very manifest  that his pride was offended, because the system of war which he had so  long and eloquently defended was given up \"by silence\" in a full house.  Hence it was, probably, that he was induced to stand single, and dare to  appeal to his country solely upon the merits--real or supposed--of his  principles. At all events, it seems certain that his resolution did  not arise, as some have imagined, from dark and inexplicable intrigue,  though it may wear that imposing aspect. But after all, as it has been  well observed, it is next to impossible to understand the extraordinary  alternations of alliance, neutrality, and opposition, between Pitt and  the old Duke of Newcastle.    In the course of this year, the treaty of Fontainbleau was somewhat  shaken by a French ship of the line having seized Turk's Island, in the  West Indies, and making the English inhabitants prisoners. The Spaniards  also annoyed and interrupted the English logwood-cutters at Honduras,  and were supposed to have seized a ship in the Mediterranean. These  occurrences happened during the recess of parliament, but before the  houses met, both the court of France and Spain disavowed all hostile  proceedings, and gave explanations to the English cabinet, which were  deemed satisfactory. It was evident, however, that the Bourbon courts  were not satisfied with the terms of the recent peace, and that their  weakness alone prevented them from renewing the struggle: their chagrin  and enmity were but ill-concealed under the mask of friendship, which  defeat in the field of battle had compelled them to wear.

The leading topics of  the king's speech referred to continental events, from which he augured  the continuation of peace. In allusion to American taxation and American  discontents, he recommended the carrying out of Grenville's measures,  and the enforcing obedience in the colonies. He remarked:--\"The  experience I have had of your former conduct makes me rely on your  wisdom and firmness, in promoting that obedience to the laws, and  respect to the legislative authority of this kingdom, which is  essentially necessary for the safety of the whole, and in establishing  such regulations as may best connect and strengthen every part of my  dominions for their mutual benefit and support.\" In this speech, also,  his majesty announced the approaching marriage of his youngest sister,  the Princess Caroline, with the Prince Royal of Denmark: a union which  was ultimately attended with tragical consequences.    Early in this session complaints were made by the opposition that the  court of Spain had not paid the Manilla ransom, which gave rise to  an angry debate; the ministers warmly defending the conduct of the  Spaniards in this particular. An attempt was also again made by the  opposition to procure a resolution against the illegality of general  warrants, but decision on this point was eluded, and the previous  question carried. Another motion, to restrain the attorney-general in  his power of filing informations _ex officio_, which was made by the  opposition, was likewise negatived by a ministerial majority. But these  were only so many preludes to a storm which took place on the subject of  colonial taxation.          DEBATES ON COLONIAL TAXATION.    It has been seen that the measure of laying a duty on stamps had been  postponed, in order to give the colonists time to propose any other  mode of taxation in lieu of it more agreeable to their own feelings. The  agents of America, however, all replied that they were instructed not  only to oppose the stamp-tax, but every other bill which assumed as a  principle the right of taxing the colonies. They urged in reply to  the statement, that it was reasonable for America to contribute her  proportion toward the general expenses of the empire; that, \"America had  never been backward in obeying the constitutional requisitions of the  crown, and contributing liberally, in her own assemblies, towards  the expenses of wars, in which, conjointly with England, she had  been engaged; that in the course of the last memorable contest, her  patriotism had been so conspicuous, that large sums had been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19226"],[0,"The Dog's Book of Verse (#13)"],[1,"  IN MEMORY OF \"DON\"        Our Don--only a dog!    Yes, only a dog, you say;    With a large, warm heart,    And a bright, brown eye,    With an earnest bark    And a warm caress      For you and me and    The friends he loved best.    Oh, how we shall    Miss him, you and I,    His noisy welcome, and    Rough good-bye!      Some time, somewhere,    Some day, I trust,    We shall meet again;    Oh, yes, we must!    And the joy of that meeting    I dare not say.      Ay, mock, ye skeptics,    And laugh to scorn    The faith I hold    Of all life that's born;    It cannot be wasted,    Nor can it be lost.      And oh, for the faith,    And the Indian's trust,    That Don and his mistress    Will meet some day--    Just over the river    Not far away!        M.S.W.            RODERICK DHU        You are just a poor dumb brute, my Roderick Dhu,    And our scientific brethren scoff at you.    They \"reason\" and they \"think,\"    Then they set it down in ink,    And clinch it with their learned \"point of view.\"      Even some divines deny you have a soul,    And reject you from Man's final heav'nly goal:    Your presence isn't wanted    You're not of the anointed.    You're not upon the mighty Judgment Roll.      Yet the truth shines from your eyes, my faithful friend,    And your faithfulness doth that of men transcend;    You would lie right down and die,    Without even wond'ring why,    To save the man you loved--and meet your end.      When my heart was almost breaking, Roderick Dhu,    Who was it gave me sympathy, but you!    You crept so close to me,    And you licked me tenderly,    And not a human friend was half so true.      And would I, reasoning wisely, pronounce you just a beast?    Your actions \"automatic,\" not \"conscious\" in the least?    Set myself so high above you,    As not to know and love you,    And toss you but a bone while I shall feast?      My bonnie Collie, such wrong there shall not be,    Not for me to grasp at Heav'n and leave the Dark for thee,    You're nothing but a dog,    Not in Heaven's Catalogue--    But whatsoe'er thy fate, the same for me.        HELEN FITZGERALD SANDERS.            QUESTIONS          Where are you now, little wandering    Life, that so faithfully dwelt with us,    Played with us, fed with us, felt with us,      Years we grew fonder and fonder in?        You who but yesterday sprang to us,    Are we forever bereft of you?    And is this all that is left of you--      One little grave, and a pang to us?        WILLIAM HURRELL MALLOCK.            HIS EPITAPH        His friends he loves. His fellest earthly foes--    Cats--I believe he did but feign to hate.    My hand will miss the insinuated nose,    Mine eyes the tail that wagged contempt at Fate.        WILLIAM WATSON.            IN MEMORIAM        I miss the little wagging tail;    I miss the plaintive, pleading wail;    I miss the wistful, loving glance;    I miss the circling welcome-dance.      I miss the eyes that, watching, sued;    I miss her tongue of gratitude    That licked my hand, in loving mood,    When we divided cup or food.      I miss the pertinacious scratch    (Continued till I raised the latch    Each morning), waiting at my door;    Alas, I ne'er shall hear it more.      \"What folly!\" hints the cynic mind,    \"Plenty of dogs are left behind    To snap and snarl, to bark and bite,    And wake us in the gloomy night.      \"You should have sought a human friend,    Whose life eternal ne'er could end--    Whose gifts of intellect and grace    Bereavement never could efface.\"      Plenty of snarling things are left,    But I am of a friend bereft;    I seek not intellect, but heart--    'Tis not my head that feels the smart.      While loving sympathy is cherished,    While gratitude is not quite perished;    While patient, hopeful, cheerful meeting    At our return is pleasant greeting;      So long my heart will feel a void--    Grieving, my mind will be employed--    When I, returning to my door,    Shall miss what I shall find no more.      When we, at last, shall pass away,    And see no more the light of day,    Will many hearts as vacant mourn--    As truly wish for our return?      Yet love that's true will ever know    The pain of parting. Better so!    \"Better to love and lose\" than cold,    And colder still, let hearts grow old.      So let the cynic snarl or smile,    And his great intellect beguile;    My little dog, so true to me,    Will dear to heart and memory be.        HENRY WILLETT.            QUESTIONS        Is there not something in the pleading eye    Of the poor brute that suffers, which arraigns    The law that bids it suffer? Has it not    A claim for some remembrance in the book    That fills its pages with the idle words    Spoken of man? Or is it only clay,    Bleeding and aching in the potter's hand,    Yet all his own to treat it as he will,    And when he will to cast it at his feet,    Shattered, dishonored, lost for evermore?    My dog loves me, but could he look beyond    His earthly master, would his love extend    To Him who--hush! I will not doubt that He    Is better than our fears, and will not wrong    The least, the meanest of created things.        OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.            OUR DOG JOCK        A rollicksome, frolicsome, rare old cock    As ever did nothing was our dog Jock;    A gleesome, fleasome, affectionate beast,    As slow at a fight as swift at a feast;    A wit among dogs, when his life 'gan fail,    One couldn't but see the old wag in his tail,    When his years grew long and his eyes grew dim,    And his course of bark could not strengthen him.    Never more now shall our knees be pressed    By his dear old chops in their slobbery rest,    Nor our mirth be stirred at his solemn looks,    As wise, and as dull, as divinity books.    Our old friend's dead, but we all well know    He's gone to the Kennels where the good dogs go,    Where the cooks be not, but the beef-bones be,    And his old head never need turn for a flea.        JAMES PAYN.            TORY, A PUPPY        He lies in the soft earth under the grass,    Where they who love him often pass,    And his grave is under a tall young lime,    In whose boughs the pale green hop-flowers climb;    But his spirit--where does his spirit rest?    It was God who made him--God knows best.        MORTIMER COLLINS.            ON AN IRISH RETRIEVER        Ten years of loving loyalty      Unthanked should not go to earth,    And I, who had no less from thee,      Devote this tribute to thy worth.      For thou didst give to me, old friend,      Thy service while thy life did last;    Thy life and service have an end,      And here I thank thee for the past.      Trusted and faithful, tried and true,      Watchful and swift to do my will,    Grateful for care that was thy due,      To duty's call obedient still,      From ill thou knew'st thou didst refrain,      The good thou knew'st thou strove to do,    Nor dream of fame, nor greed of gain,      Man's keenest spurs, urged thee thereto.      Brute, with a heart of human love,      And speechless soul of instinct fine!    How few by reason's law who move      Deserve an epitaph like thine!        FANNY KEMBLE BUTLER.            A RETRIEVER'S EPITAPH        Beneath this turf, that formerly he pressed    With agile feet, a dog is laid to rest;    Him, as he sleeps, no well-known sound shall stir,    The rabbit's patter, or the pheasant's whir;    The keeper's \"Over\"--far, but well defined,    That speeds the startled partridge down the wind;    The whistled warning as the winged ones rise    Large and more large upon our straining eyes,    Till with a sweep, while every nerve is tense,    The chattering covey hurtles o'er the fence;    The double crack of every lifted gun,    The dinting thud of birds whose course is done--    These sounds, delightful to his listening ear,    He heeds no longer, for he cannot hear.    None stauncher, till the drive was done, defied    Temptation, rooted to his master's side;    None swifter, when his master gave the word,    Leapt on his course to track the running bird,    And bore it back--ah, many a time and oft--    His nose as faultless as his mouth was soft.    How consciously, how proudly unconcerned,    Straight to his master's side he then returned,    Wagged a glad tail, and deemed himself repaid    As in that master's hand the bird he laid,    If, while a word of praise was duly said,    The hand should stroke his smooth and honest head.    Through spring and summer, in the sportless days,    Cheerful he lived a life of simpler ways;    Chose, since official dogs at times unbend,    The household cat for confidante and friend;    With children friendly, but untaught to fawn,    Romped through the walks and rollicked on the lawn,    Rejoiced, if one the frequent ball should throw,    To fetch it, scampering gaily to and fro,    Content through every change of sportive mood    If one dear voice, one only, called him good.      Such was my dog, who now, without my aid,    Hunts through the shadowland, himself a shade,    Or crouched intent before some ghostly gate,    Waits for my step, as here he used to wait.
