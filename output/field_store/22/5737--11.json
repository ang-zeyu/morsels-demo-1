Des forêts de noirs sapins nous ombrageaient  tristement à droite. Un grand bois de chênes était à gauche au-delà du  torrent; et au-dessous de nous, cette immense plaine d'eau que le lac  forme au sein des Alpes, nous séparait des riches coteaux du pays de  Vaud, dont la cime du majestueux Jura couronnait le tableau.    Au milieu de ces grands et superbes objets, le petit terrain où nous  étions, étalait les charmes d'un séjour riant et champêtre; quelques  ruisseaux filtraient à travers les rochers, et roulaient sur la verdure  en filets de cristal. Quelques arbres fruitiers sauvages penchaient  leurs têtes sur les nôtres. La terre humide et fraîche était couverte  d'herbe et de fleurs. En comparant un si doux séjour aux objets qui  l'environnaient, il semblait que ce lieu désert dût être l'asile de deux  amants échappés seuls au bouleversement de la nature.    J.-J. Rousseau.

He spared no efforts, dedicating his life to the  promotion of the principles of the Gospel, and he solidly established the  Roman government, which in reality had been nothing but a system of  unrelieved oppression, on moderation and justice. His blessed name shines  out across the dawn of history like the morning star, and his rank and  fame among the world's noblest and most highly civilized is still on the  tongues of Christians of all denominations.    What a firm foundation of excellent character was laid down in those days,  thanks to the training of holy souls who arose to promote the teachings of  the Gospel. How many primary schools, colleges, hospitals, were  established, and institutions where fatherless and indigent children  received their education. How many were the individuals who sacrificed  their own personal advantages and \"out of desire to please the Lord\"(56)  devoted the days of their lives to teaching the masses.    When, however, the time approached for the effulgent beauty of Muhammad to  dawn upon the world, the control of Christian affairs passed into the  hands of ignorant priests. Those heavenly breezes, soft-flowing from the  regions of Divine grace, died away, and the laws of the great Evangel, the  rock-foundation on which the civilization of the world was based, turned  barren of results, this out of misuse and because of the conduct of  persons who, seemingly fair, were yet inwardly foul.    The noted historians of Europe, in describing the conditions, manners,  politics, learning and culture, in all their aspects, of early, medieval  and modern times, unanimously record that during the ten centuries  constituting the Middle Ages, from the beginning of the sixth century of  the Christian era till the close of the fifteenth, Europe was in every  respect and to an extreme degree, barbaric and dark. The principal cause  of this was that the monks, referred to by European peoples as spiritual  and religious leaders, had given up the abiding glory that comes from  obedience to the sacred commandments and heavenly teachings of the Gospel,  and had joined forces with the presumptuous and tyrannical rulers of the  temporal governments of those times. They had turned their eyes away from  everlasting glory, and were devoting all their efforts to the furtherance  of their mutual worldly interests and passing and perishable advantages.  Ultimately things reached a point where the masses were hopeless prisoners  in the hands of these two groups, and all this brought down in ruins the  whole structure of the religion, culture, welfare and civilization of the  peoples of Europe.    When the unworthy acts and thoughts and the discreditable purposes of the  leaders had stilled the sweet savors of the Spirit of God (Jesus) and they  ceased to stream across the world, and the darkness of ignorance and  bigotry and of actions that were displeasing to God, encompassed the  earth, then the dawn of hope shone out and the Divine spring drew on; a  cloud of mercy overspread the world, and out of the regions of grace the  fecund winds began to blow. In the sign of Muhammad, the Sun of Truth rose  over Ya_th_rib (Medina) and the Hijaz and cast across the universe the  lights of eternal glory. Then the earth of human potentialities was  transformed, and the words \"The earth shall shine with the light of her  Lord,\"(57) were fulfilled. The old world turned new again, and its dead  body rose into abundant life. Then tyranny and ignorance were overthrown,  and towering palaces of knowledge and justice were reared in their place.  A sea of enlightenment thundered, and science cast down its rays. The  savage peoples of the Hijaz, before that Flame of supreme Prophethood was  lit in the lamp of Mecca, were the most brutish and benighted of all the  peoples of the earth. In all the histories, their depraved and vicious  practices, their ferocity and their constant feuds, are a matter of  record. In those days the civilized peoples of the world did not even  consider the Arab tribes of Mecca and Medina as human beings. And yet,  after the Light of the World rose over them, they were--because of the  education bestowed on them by that Mine of perfections, that Focal Center  of Revelation, and the blessings vouchsafed by the Divine Law--within a  brief interval gathered into the shelter of the principle of Divine  oneness. This brutish people then attained such a high degree of human  perfection and civilization that all their contemporaries marveled at  them. Those very peoples who had always mocked the Arabs and held them up  to ridicule as a breed devoid of judgment, now eagerly sought them out,  visiting their countries to acquire enlightenment and culture, technical  skills, statecraft, arts and sciences.    Observe the influence on material situations of that training which is  inculcated by the true Educator. Here were tribes so benighted and untamed  that during the period of the Jahiliyyih they would bury their  seven-year-old daughters alive--an act which even an animal, let alone a  human being, would hate and shrink from but which they in their extreme  degradation considered the ultimate expression of honor and devotion to  principle--and this darkened people, thanks to the manifest teachings of  that great Personage, advanced to such a degree that after they conquered  Egypt, Syria and its capital Damascus, Chaldea, Mesopotamia and Iran, they  came to administer single-handedly whatever matters were of major  importance in four main regions of the globe.    The Arabs then excelled all the peoples of the world in science and the  arts, in industry and invention, in philosophy, government and moral  character. And truly, the rise of this brutish and despicable element, in  such a short interval, to the supreme heights of human perfection, is the  greatest demonstration of the rightfulness of the Lord Muhammad's  Prophethood.    In the early ages of Islam the peoples of Europe acquired the sciences and  arts of civilization from Islam as practiced by the inhabitants of  Andalusia. A careful and thorough investigation of the historical record  will establish the fact that the major part of the civilization of Europe  is derived from Islam; for all the writings of Muslim scholars and divines  and philosophers were gradually collected in Europe and were with the most  painstaking care weighed and debated at academic gatherings and in the  centers of learning, after which their valued contents would be put to  use. Today, numerous copies of the works of Muslim scholars which are not  to be found in Islamic countries, are available in the libraries of  Europe. Furthermore, the laws and principles current in all European  countries are derived to a considerable degree and indeed virtually in  their entirety from the works on jurisprudence and the legal decision of  Muslim theologians. Were it not for the fear of unduly lengthening the  present text, We would cite these borrowings one by one.    The beginnings of European civilization date from the seventh century of  the Muslim era. The particulars were these: toward the end of the fifth  century of the hegira, the Pope or Head of Christendom set up a great hue  and cry over the fact that places sacred to the Christians, such as  Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth, had fallen under Muslim rule, and he  stirred up the kings and the commoners of Europe to undertake what he  considered a holy war. His impassioned outcry waxed so loud that all the  countries of Europe responded, and crusading kings at the head of  innumerable hosts passed over the Sea of Marmara and made their way to the  continent of Asia. In those days the Fatimid caliphs ruled over Egypt and  some countries of the West, and most of the time the kings of Syria, that  is the Saljuqs, were subject to them as well. Briefly, the kings of the  West with their unnumbered armies fell upon Syria and Egypt, and there was  continuous warfare between the Syrian rulers and those of Europe for a  period of two hundred and three years. Reinforcements were always coming  in from Europe, and time and time again the Western rulers stormed and  took over every castle in Syria, and as often, the kings of Islam  delivered them out of their hands. Finally Saladin, in the year 693 A.H.,  drove the European kings and their armies out of Egypt and off the Syrian  coast. Hopelessly beaten, they went back to Europe. In the course of these  wars of the Crusades, millions of human beings perished. To sum up, from  490 A.H. until 693, kings, commanders and other European leaders  continually came and went between Egypt, Syria and the West, and when in  the end they all returned home, they introduced into Europe whatever they  had observed over two hundred and odd years in Muslim countries as to  government, social development and learning, colleges, schools and the  refinements of living. The civilization of Europe dates from that time.    O people of Persia! How long will your torpor and lethargy last? You were  once the lords of the whole earth; the world was at your beck and call.  How is it that your glory has lapsed and you have fallen from favor now,  and crept away into some corner of oblivion? You were the fountainhead of  learning, the unfailing spring of light for all the earth, how is it that  you are withered now, and quenched, and faint of heart? You who once lit  the world, how is it that you lurk, inert, bemused, in darkness now? Open  your mind's eye, see your great and present need. Rise up and struggle,  seek education, seek enlightenment. Is it meet that a foreign people  should receive from your own forbears its culture and its knowledge, and  that you, their blood, their rightful heirs, should go without? How does  it seem, when your neighbors are at work by day and night with their whole  hearts, providing for their advancement, their honor and prosperity, that  you, in your"]]]
