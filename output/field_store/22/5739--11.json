Immerse  them in the ocean of Thy mercy, and quicken them through the breaths of  the Holy Spirit.    O Lord! Bestow Thy gracious aid and confirmation upon this just  government. This country lieth beneath the sheltering shadow of Thy  protection, and this people is in Thy service. O Lord! Confer upon them  Thy heavenly bounty and render the outpourings of Thy grace and favor  copious and abundant. Suffer this esteemed nation to be held in honor, and  enable it to be admitted into Thy kingdom.    Thou art the Powerful, the Omnipotent, the Merciful, and Thou art the  Generous, the Beneficent, the Lord of grace abounding.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O Divine Providence! This assemblage is composed...\"      O Divine Providence! This assemblage is composed of Thy friends who are  attracted to Thy beauty and are set ablaze by the fire of Thy love. Turn  these souls into heavenly angels, resuscitate them through the breath of  Thy Holy Spirit, grant them eloquent tongues and resolute hearts, bestow  upon them heavenly power and merciful susceptibilities, cause them to  become the promulgators of the oneness of mankind and the cause of love  and concord in the world of humanity, so that the perilous darkness of  ignorant prejudice may vanish through the light of the Sun of Truth, this  dreary world may become illumined, this material realm may absorb the rays  of the world of spirit, these different colors may merge into one color  and the melody of praise may rise to the kingdom of Thy sanctity.    Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, and the Almighty!    --'Abdu'l-Baha          MORNING        \"O my God and my Master! I am Thy servant...\"      O my God and my Master! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I  have risen from my couch at this dawntide when the Daystar of Thy oneness  hath shone forth from the Dayspring of Thy will, and hath shed its  radiance upon the whole world, according to what had been ordained in the  Books of Thy Decree.    Praise be unto Thee, O my God, that we have wakened to the splendors of  the light of Thy knowledge. Send down, then, upon us, O my Lord, what will  enable us to dispense with anyone but Thee, and will rid us of all  attachment to aught except Thyself. Write down, moreover, for me, and for  such as are dear to me, and for my kindred, man and woman alike, the good  of this world and the world to come. Keep us safe, then, through Thine  unfailing protection, O Thou the Beloved of the entire creation and the  Desire of the whole universe, from them whom Thou hast made to be the  manifestations of the Evil Whisperer, who whisper in men's breasts. Potent  art Thou to do Thy pleasure. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Help in  Peril, the Self-Subsisting.    Bless Thou, O Lord my God, Him Whom Thou hast set over Thy most excellent  Titles, and through Whom Thou hast divided between the godly and the  wicked, and graciously aid us to do what Thou lovest and desirest. Bless  Thou, moreover, O my God, them Who are Thy Words and Thy Letters, and them  who have set their faces towards Thee, and turned unto Thy face, and  hearkened to Thy Call.    Thou art, truly, the Lord and King of all men, and art potent over all  things.    --Baha'u'llah        \"I have wakened in Thy shelter, O my God, and...\"      I have wakened in Thy shelter, O my God, and it becometh him that seeketh  that shelter to abide within the Sanctuary of Thy protection and the  Stronghold of Thy defense. Illumine my inner being, O my Lord, with the  splendors of the Dayspring of Thy Revelation, even as Thou didst illumine  my outer being with the morning light of Thy favor.    --Baha'u'llah        \"I have risen this morning by Thy grace, O my...\"      I have risen this morning by Thy grace, O my God, and left my home  trusting wholly in Thee, and committing myself to Thy care. Send down,  then, upon me, out of the heaven of Thy mercy, a blessing from Thy side,  and enable me to return home in safety even as Thou didst enable me to set  out under Thy protection with my thoughts fixed steadfastly upon Thee.    There is none other God but Thee, the One, the Incomparable, the  All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    --Baha'u'llah        \"I give praise to Thee, O my God, that Thou hast...\"      I give praise to Thee, O my God, that Thou hast awakened me out of my  sleep, and brought me forth after my disappearance, and raised me up from  my slumber. I have wakened this morning with my face set toward the  splendors of the Daystar of Thy Revelation, through Which the heavens of  Thy power and Thy majesty have been illumined, acknowledging Thy signs,  believing in Thy Book, and holding fast unto Thy Cord.    I beseech Thee, by the potency of Thy will and the compelling power of Thy  purpose, to make of what Thou didst reveal unto me in my sleep the surest  foundation for the mansions of Thy love that are within the hearts of Thy  loved ones, and the best instrument for the revelation of the tokens of  Thy grace and Thy loving-kindness.    Do Thou ordain for me through Thy most exalted Pen, O my Lord, the good of  this world and of the next. I testify that within Thy grasp are held the  reins of all things. Thou changest them as Thou pleasest. No God is there  save Thee, the Strong, the Faithful.    Thou art He Who changeth through His bidding abasement into glory, and  weakness into strength, and powerlessness into might, and fear into calm,  and doubt into certainty. No God is there but Thee, the Mighty, the  Beneficent.    Thou disappointest no one who hath sought Thee, nor dost Thou keep back  from Thee anyone who hath desired Thee. Ordain Thou for me what becometh  the heaven of Thy generosity, and the ocean of Thy bounty. Thou art,  verily, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.    --Baha'u'llah          PRAISE AND GRATITUDE        \"All praise, O my God, be to Thee Who art the...\"      All praise, O my God, be to Thee Who art the Source of all glory and  majesty, of greatness and honor, of sovereignty and dominion, of loftiness  and grace, of awe and power. Whomsoever Thou willest Thou causest to draw  nigh unto the Most Great Ocean, and on whomsoever Thou desirest Thou  conferrest the honor of recognizing Thy Most Ancient Name. Of all who are  in heaven and on earth, none can withstand the operation of Thy sovereign  Will. From all eternity Thou didst rule the entire creation, and Thou wilt  continue for evermore to exercise Thy dominion over all created things.  There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, The Most Exalted, the  All-Powerful, the All-Wise.    Illumine, O Lord, the faces of Thy servants, that they may behold Thee;  and cleanse their hearts that they may turn unto the court of Thy heavenly  favors, and recognize Him Who is the Manifestation of Thy Self and the  Dayspring of Thine Essence. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all worlds. There  is no God but Thee, the Unconstrained, the All-Subduing.    --Baha'u'llah        \"In the Name of God, the Most High! Lauded...\"      In the Name of God, the Most High! Lauded and glorified art Thou, Lord,  God Omnipotent! Thou before Whose wisdom the wise falleth short and  faileth, before Whose knowledge the learned confesseth his ignorance,  before Whose might the strong waxeth weak, before Whose wealth the rich  testifieth to his poverty, before Whose light the enlightened is lost in  darkness, toward the shrine of Whose knowledge turneth the essence of all  understanding and around the sanctuary of Whose presence circle the souls  of all mankind.    How then can I sing and tell of Thine Essence, which the wisdom of the  wise and the learning of the learned have failed to comprehend, inasmuch  as no man can sing that which he understandeth not, nor recount that unto  which he cannot attain, whilst Thou hast been from everlasting the  Inaccessible, the Unsearchable. Powerless though I be to rise to the  heavens of Thy glory and soar in the realms of Thy knowledge, I can but  recount Thy tokens that tell of Thy glorious handiwork.    By Thy Glory! O Beloved of all hearts, Thou that alone canst still the  pangs of yearning for Thee! Though all the dwellers of heaven and earth  unite to glorify the least of Thy signs, wherein and whereby Thou hast  revealed Thyself, yet would they fail, how much more to praise Thy holy  Word, the creator of all Thy tokens.    All praise and glory be to Thee, Thou of Whom all things have testified  that Thou art one and there is none other God but Thee, Who hast been from  everlasting exalted above all peer or likeness and to everlasting shalt  remain the same. All kings are but Thy servants and all beings, visible  and invisible, as naught before Thee. There is none other God but Thee,  the Gracious, the Powerful, the Most High.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Magnified be Thy name, O Lord my God!...\"      Magnified be Thy name, O Lord my God! Thou art He Whom all things worship  and Who worshipeth no one, Who is the Lord of all things and is the vassal  of none, Who knoweth all things and is known of none. Thou didst wish to  make Thyself known unto men; therefore, Thou didst, through a word of Thy  mouth, bring creation into being and fashion the universe. There is none  other God except Thee, the Fashioner, the Creator, the Almighty, the Most  Powerful.    I implore Thee, by this very word that hath shone forth above the horizon  of Thy will, to enable me to drink deep of the living waters through which  Thou hast vivified the hearts of Thy chosen ones and quickened the souls  of them that love Thee, that I may, at all times and under all conditions,  turn my face wholly towards Thee.    Thou art the God of power, of glory and bounty. No God is there beside  Thee, the Supreme Ruler, the All-Glorious, the Omniscient.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God!

I yield Thee thanks for having"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19243"],[0,"The Advent of Divine Justice (#13)"],[1,"differentiated elements of the human race,  harmoniously interwoven into the fabric of an all-embracing Baha'i  fraternity, and assimilated through the dynamic processes of a divinely  appointed Administrative Order, and contributing each its share to the  enrichment and glory of Baha'i community life, is surely an achievement  the contemplation of which must warm and thrill every Baha'i heart.  \"Consider the flowers of a garden,\" 'Abdu'l-Baha has written, \"though  differing in kind, color, form, and shape, yet, inasmuch as they are  refreshed by the waters of one spring, revived by the breath of one wind,  invigorated by the rays of one sun, this diversity increaseth their charm,  and addeth unto their beauty. How unpleasing to the eye if all the flowers  and plants, the leaves and blossoms, the fruits, the branches and the  trees of that garden were all of the same shape and color! Diversity of  hues, form and shape, enricheth and adorneth the garden, and heighteneth  the effect thereof. In like manner, when divers shades of thought,  temperament and character, are brought together under the power and  influence of one central agency, the beauty and glory of human perfection  will be revealed and made manifest. Naught but the celestial potency of  the Word of God, which ruleth and transcendeth the realities of all  things, is capable of harmonizing the divergent thoughts, sentiments,  ideas, and convictions of the children of men.\" \"I hope,\" is the wish  expressed by 'Abdu'l-Baha, \"that ye may cause that downtrodden race  [Negro] to become glorious, and to be joined with the white race to serve  the world of man with the utmost sincerity, faithfulness, love and  purity.\" \"One of the important questions,\" He also has written, \"which  affect the unity and the solidarity of mankind is the fellowship and  equality of the white and colored races.\" \"You must attach great  importance,\" writes 'Abdu'l-Baha in the Tablets of the Divine Plan, \"to  the Indians, the original inhabitants of America. For these souls may be  likened unto the ancient inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, who, prior  to the Revelation of Muhammad, were like savages. When the Muhammadan  Light shone forth in their midst, they became so enkindled that they shed  illumination upon the world. Likewise, should these Indians be educated  and properly guided, there can be no doubt that through the Divine  teachings they will become so enlightened that the whole earth will be  illumined.\" \"If it is possible,\" 'Abdu'l-Baha has also written, \"send ye  teachers to other portions of Canada; likewise, dispatch ye teachers to  Greenland and the home of the Eskimos.\" \"God willing,\" He further has  written in those same Tablets, \"the call of the Kingdom may reach the ears  of the Eskimos.... Should you display an effort, so that the fragrances of  God may be diffused among the Eskimos, its effect will be very great and  far-reaching.\" \"Praise be to God,\" writes 'Abdu'l-Baha, \"that whatsoever  hath been announced in the Blessed Tablets unto the Israelites, and the  things explicitly written in the letters of 'Abdu'l-Baha, are all being  fulfilled. Some have come to pass; others will be revealed in the future.  The Ancient Beauty hath in His sacred Tablets explicitly written that the  day of their abasement is over. His bounty will overshadow them, and this  race will day by day progress, and be delivered from its age-long  obscurity and degradation.\"    Let those who are holding administrative positions in their capacity as  members of either the National Spiritual Assembly, or of the national, the  regional, or local teaching committees, continually bear in mind the vital  and urgent necessity of insuring, within as short a time as possible, the  formation, in the few remaining states of the North American Republic and  the provinces of the Dominion of Canada, of groups, however small and  rudimentary, and of providing every facility within their power to enable  these newly formed nuclei to evolve, swiftly and along sound lines, into  properly functioning, self-sufficient, and recognized Assemblies. To the  laying of such foundations, the erection of such outposts--a work  admittedly arduous, yet sorely needed and highly inspiring--the individual  members of the American Baha'i community must lend their unstinted,  continual, and enthusiastic support. Wise as may be the measures which  their elected representatives may devise, however practical and well  conceived the plans they formulate, such measures and plans can never  yield any satisfactory results unless a sufficient number of pioneers have  determined to make the necessary sacrifices, and to volunteer to carry  these projects into effect. To implant, once and for all, the banner of  Baha'u'llah in the heart of these virgin territories, to erect the  structural basis of His Administrative Order in their cities and villages,  and to establish a firm and permanent anchorage for its institutions in  the minds and hearts of their inhabitants, constitute, I firmly believe,  the first and most significant step in the successive stages through which  the teaching campaign, inaugurated under the Seven Year Plan, must pass.  Whereas the external ornamentation of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, under  this same Plan, has now entered the final phase in its development, the  teaching campaign is still in its initial stages, and is far from having  extended effectively its ramifications to either these virgin territories,  or to those Republics that are situated in the South American continent.  The effort required is prodigious, the conditions under which these  preliminary establishments are to be made are often unattractive and  unfavorable, the workers who are in a position to undertake such tasks  limited, and the resources they can command meager and inadequate. And  yet, how often has the pen of Baha'u'llah assured us that \"should a man,  all alone, arise in the name of Baha, and put on the armor of His love,  him will the Almighty cause to be victorious, though the forces of earth  and heaven be arrayed against him.\" Has He not written: \"By God, besides  Whom is none other God! Should anyone arise for the triumph of our Cause,  him will God render victorious though tens of thousands of enemies be  leagued against him. And if his love for me wax stronger, God will  establish his ascendancy over all the powers of earth and heaven.\"  \"Consider the work of former generations,\" 'Abdu'l-Baha has written;  \"During the lifetime of Jesus Christ the believing, firm souls were few  and numbered, but the heavenly blessings descended so plentifully that in  a number of years countless souls entered beneath the shadow of the  Gospel. God has said in the Qur'an: 'One grain will bring forth seven  sheaves, and every sheaf shall contain one hundred grains.' In other  words, one grain will become seven hundred; and if God so wills He will  double these also. It has often happened that one blessed soul has become  the cause of the guidance of a nation. Now we must not consider our  ability and capacity, nay rather we must fix our gaze upon the favors and  bounties of God, in these days, Who has made of the drop a sea, and of the  atom a sun.\" Let those who resolve to be the first to hoist the standard  of such a Cause, under such conditions, and in such territories, nourish  their souls with the sustaining power of these words, and, \"putting on the  armor of His love,\" a love which must \"wax stronger\" as they persevere in  their lonesome task, arise to adorn with the tale of their deeds the most  brilliant pages ever written in their country's spiritual history.    \"Although,\" 'Abdu'l-Baha, in the Tablets of the Divine Plan, has written,  \"in most of the states and cities of the United States, praise be to God,  His fragrances are diffused, and souls unnumbered are turning their faces  and advancing toward the Kingdom of God, yet in some of the states the  Standard of Unity is not yet upraised as it should be, nor are the  mysteries of the Holy Books, such as the Bible, the Gospel, and the  Qur'an, unraveled. Through the concerted efforts of all the friends the  Standard of Unity must needs be unfurled in those states, and the Divine  teachings promoted, so that these states may also receive their portion of  the heavenly bestowals and a share of the Most Great Guidance.\" \"The  future of the Dominion of Canada,\" He, in another Tablet of the Divine  Plan, has asserted, \"is very great, and the events connected with it  infinitely glorious. The eye of God's loving-kindness will be turned  towards it, and it shall become the manifestation of the favors of the  All-Glorious.\" \"Again I repeat,\" He, in that same Tablet reaffirms His  previous statement, \"that the future of Canada, whether from a material or  a spiritual standpoint, is very great.\"    No sooner is this initial step taken, involving as it does the formation  of at least one nucleus in each of these virgin states and provinces in  the North American continent, than the machinery for a tremendous  intensification of Baha'i concerted effort must be set in motion, the  purpose of which should be the reinforcement of the noble exertions which  only a few isolated believers are now making for the awakening of the  nations of Latin America to the Call of Baha'u'llah. Not until this second  phase of the teaching campaign, under the Seven Year Plan, has been  entered can the campaign be regarded as fully launched, or the Plan itself  as having attained the most decisive stage in its evolution. So powerful  will be the effusions of Divine grace that will be poured forth upon a  valiant community that has already in the administrative sphere erected,  in all the glory of its exterior ornamentation, its chief Edifice, and in  the teaching field raised aloft, in every state and province, in the North  American continent the banner of its Faith--so great will be these"]]]
