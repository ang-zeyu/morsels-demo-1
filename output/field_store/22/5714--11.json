Though  the proportions of ash and clay are varied at the will of the maker,  and according to the quality of the bark, a superior kind of pottery  is produced by a mixture of equal parts of fine clay and ashes. All  sorts of vessels of small or large size for household or other  purposes are made of this kind of ware, as are also vases or  ornamental articles, many of which are painted and glazed. These  articles are all very durable, and are able to stand almost any amount  of heat; they are consequently much used by the natives for boiling  eggs, heating milk, and indeed for culinary purposes generally. A  brief glance at the structure of the bark will show how it comes to be  so well adapted for this purpose. The bark seldom grows more than half  an inch thick, and is covered with a skin or epidermis; when fresh, it  cuts somewhat similar to a soft sandstone, but when dry, it is very  brittle and flint like, and often difficult to break. On examination  of a section under the microscope, all the cells of the different  layers are seen to be more or less silicated, the silex forming in the  cells when the bark is still very young. In the inner bark the flint  is deposited in a very regular manner, the particles being straight  and giving off branches at right angles; that of the porous cells of  the bark, however, is very much contorted, and ramifies in all  directions. In the best varieties of the tree, those growing in rich  and dry soil, the silex can be readily detected by the naked eye; but  to test the quality of the various kinds of bark, the natives burn it  and then try its strength between their fingers; if it breaks easily  it is considered of little value, but if it requires a mortar and  pestle to break, its quality is pronounced good. From an analysis of  this singular bark, that of old trees has been found to give 30.8 per  cent of ash, and that of young 23.30 per cent. Of the different layers  of old bark, the outer gave 17.15 per cent, the middle 37.7, and the  inner 31. The wood of the tree, in comparison with the bark, is  relatively poor in silex, the duramen of an old tree giving only 2.5  per cent of silex.           *       *       *       *       *          GLASS SPONGES.      The natural history of sponges had, up to the middle of this century,  been comparatively neglected. Until 1856, when Lieberkuhn published  his treatise on sponges, very little or nothing had been written on  the subject. Later, Haeckel did much to determine their exact nature,  and it is now universally admitted that sponges form one of the  connecting links between the animal and the vegetable kingdom.    Sponges, generally considered, consist of fine porous tissue, covered,  during life, with viscid, semi-liquid protoplasm, and are held in  shape and strengthened by a more or less rigid skeleton, consisting  chiefly of lime or silica. The tissue consists of a very fine network  of threads, formed probably by gradual solidification of the threads  of protoplasm. The inorganic skeleton is formed by larger and smaller  crystals and crystalline threads. In the various families of sponges  the quantity of inorganic matter varies greatly; some sponges are  nearly devoid of an inorganic skeleton, while other families consist  chiefly of lime or silica, the organic tissue being only rudimentarily  developed.    As observed in their natural state, sponges are apparently lifeless.  When, however, a live sponge is placed in water containing some finely  powdered pigment in suspension, it will be noticed that in regular,  short intervals water is absorbed through the pores of the tissue and  ejected again through larger openings, which are called \"osculae.\"  Following up these into the interior, we find them divided into  numerous branches, the walls of which are, under the microscope, found  to be covered with minute cells, fastened at one end only and  oscillating continually. By means of these cells the sponge receives  its nourishment.    Sponges with very rigid inorganic skeletons may be divided into two  classes--calcareous and silicious--according to whether the skeleton  is chiefly composed of lime or silica.    Our engravings represent two species of the latter kind, which are, on  account of the peculiar appearance of their skeleton, called glass  sponges.    Fig. 1 represents the \"sprinkling pot sponge,\" _Eucleptella  aspergillum_. It is generally found in very deep water throughout the  Pacific. Specimens were found over fifty years ago, but, as they had  to be brought up from depths between 500 and 800 fathoms, they  remained very scarce and sold at fabulous prices.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--SPRINKLING POT SPONGE.--(_Eucleptella  aspergillum_.)]    The skeleton is formed by small crystals and long threads of vitreous  silica, cemented together, during life, by protoplasm. They are  arranged in longitudinal and annular bands so as to form a long curved  cylinder, about nine to twelve inches long, the walls of which are  about one inch in thickness. The threads and bands are interwoven with  the greatest regularity, and when the skeleton is freed from the  adhering organic matter, it looks extremely beautiful.    The mode in which the intersecting bunches of crystals are connected  is shown in Fig. 2. The upper end of the cylinder is closed by a  perforated cover, which probably has given rise to the name of the  sponge. The upper portion of the cylinder is surrounded by a few  irregular, annular masses of organic tissue, which adheres loosely  only to the skeleton. The lower end is formed by a bunch of long  threads, rooting firmly in the ground.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.--SPONGE CRYSTALS MAGNIFIED.]    Up to about ten years ago the price of specimens of this sponge was  very high. At that time, however, a colony of Eucleptellas was found  near the cities of Cebu and Manila, in the East Indies, in a depth not  exceeding 100 fathoms, and since they have appeared in larger  quantities in the market. It is remarkable that, contrary to their  habits, these organisms have immigrated into regions to which they  were totally unaccustomed. Yet it must be regarded as a greater  curiosity that they have been accompanied to their new abode by a few  animals living in equally deep water and never met with before at  depths less than three or four hundred fathoms. Among these animals is  a _Phormosoma_ (water hedgehog), noted for its long spines.    Glass sponges are not confined to tropical regions. They are met with  in latitudes as high as the Faeroee Islands, where the beautiful  _Holtenia Carpentaria_ abounds. It is represented in Fig. 3. Its  cup-shaped skeleton is similar in structure to that of the  _Eucleptella_; numerous crystalline needles protrude from the surface  of the upper part. Lately some specimens of _Holtenia_ have been found  on the coast of Florida.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--HOLTENIA CARPENTERIA.]    Glass sponges serve as dwellings for numerous animals, especially  crustaceae. A small shrimp inhabits the tubes of the _Eucleptella_, a  male and a female generally living together. They are shut up as in a  prison in their crystalline home, as they are generally too large to  pass through the meshes formed by the bundles of crystals. It was  formerly believed that these skeletons had actually been built by the  shrimps, and we can find no explanation for this curious circumstance,  other than that the shrimps entered these habitations while very small  and became too large to leave them.           *       *       *       *       *          PLANTS PROTECTED BY INSECTS.      Mr. Francis Darwin, in a lecture on \"Means of Self-Defense among  Plants,\" delivered lately at the London Institution, said that one of  the most curious forms of defense known is afforded by a recently  discovered class of plants, which, being stingless themselves, are  protected by stinging ants, which make their home in the plant and  defend it against its enemies. Of these the most remarkable is the  bull's-horn acacia (described by the late Mr. Belt in his book \"The  Naturalist in Nicaragua\"), a shrubby tree with gigantic curved thorns,  from which its name is derived. These horns are hollow and tenanted by  ants, which bore a hole in them, and the workers may be seen running  about over the green leaves. If a branch is shaken the ants swarm out  of the thorns and attack the aggressor with their stings. Their chief  service to the plant consists in defending it against leaf-cutting  ants, which are the great enemy of all vegetation in that part of  America. The latter form large underground nests, and their work of  destruction consists in gathering leaves, which they strip to form  heaps of material, which become covered over with a delicate white  fungus, on which the larvae of the ants are fed, so that literally they  are a colony of mushroom growers. The special province of the little  stinging ants, which live in the thorns of the acacia, is, therefore,  to protect the leaves of the shrub from being used by the leaf-cutters  to make mushroom beds. Certain varieties of the orange tree have  leaves which are distasteful to the leaf-cutters, this property of the  leaves thus forming a means of defense. Other plants are unaccountably  spared by them--grass, for example, which, if brought to the nest, is  at once thrown out by some ant in authority. The bull's-horn acacia,  in return for the service rendered by the stinging ants, not only  affords them shelter in its thorns, but provides them with nectar  secreted by glands at the base of its leaves, and also grows for them  small yellow pear-shaped bodies, about one twelfth of an inch in  length, at the tip of some of its leaflets, which they use as food.  These little yellow bodies are made up of cells containing protoplasm  rich in oil, and afford the insects an excellent food. When the leaf  unfolds, the ants may be seen running from one leaflet to another, to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18880"],[0,"The New York Times Current History: the European War, February, 1915 (#13)"],[1,"this tax.    All persons freed from military service within the last four years are  to pay an additional tax equal to 50 per cent. of their income tax,  provided the incomes of the parents whose sons have been freed reach  2,000 rubles ($1,000).    All persons freed from military service having incomes below 1,000  rubles ($500) are to pay a uniform tax of 6 rubles ($3). A special war  tax is to be levied in provinces where the whole population or certain  groups of the population are freed from military service.    Note: For a poor country like Russia the minimum exempt from taxation is  very high. The large number of able-bodied men in war would cut into  this tax considerably. It has been figured out that the special 6-ruble  tax on those freed from the military service would yield about  13,000,000 rubles ($6,500,000). The total revenue from this tax would  hardly reach 50,000,000 rubles. Commenting upon this bill, critics have  proposed to reduce the minimum exempt from taxation from 1,000 rubles  ($500) to 750 rubles ($375) and to cut out the special 6-ruble war tax.          PING PONG.    By BEATRICE BARRY.          Faith, hear our soldier boys a-sighin'      'Cause Major General John O'Ryan        Won't let 'em dance!

Tools of the Russian Juggernaut    By M.J. Bonn.         Prof. Bonn is Professor of Political Economy at the University       of Munich and German Visiting Professor to the University of       California. The following article by him was published on Aug.       8, 1914, in the first week of war.      As long as hostile censors muzzle truth there is no use in discussing  the European military situation. Where the ingenuity of American  newspaper men has failed it would be presumptuous for any one to try.  But the question, Why are we at war? can be answered fairly well by  anybody conversant with the facts of the European situation.    We are not at war because the Emperor, as war lord, has sent out word to  his legions to begin a war of world-wide aggression, carrying into its  vortex intellectual Germany, notwithstanding all her peaceful  aspirations.    I may fairly claim to be a representative of that intellectual Germany  which comes in now for a good deal of sympathy, but I must own that  intellectual Germany, as far as I know about her, thoroughly approves of  the Emperor's present policy.    She approves of it not on the principle merely \"Right or wrong, my  country\"; she does so because she knows that war has become inevitable,  and that we must face that ordeal when we are ready for it, not at the  moment most agreeable to our enemies. If intellectual Germany wants to  develop the moral and intellectual qualities of the German people she  can do so only if there is peace--real peace--not endangered by the fear  of some sudden and treacherous aggression.    We approve of the war because we realize that such a peace was no longer  possible. Some of our critics are trying to show that we wanted a war,  as we wanted the colonial empire of France.    We have, indeed, refused the demand made by England as the price for her  neutrality--that we should not be allowed to take any part of France's  colonial domains, even in case of complete victory.    We refused this stipulation, not because we were after those colonies,  but because a so-called neutral power tried to impose conditions upon us  she would never have dreamed of asking from France.    If we were hankering after conquest we would have made war long ago. We  would have done so during the Morocco crisis, when Russia had not yet  recovered from the Japanese war; when Turkey was still a mighty empire,  ready to take our side, overawing the Balkan States and threatening  Russia; when Rumania was our ally and when France, trying to swallow up  the independent States of Morocco, but put herself morally in the wrong.    We refrained from war not because England supported France. The  developments of the last week have shown that we are ready to face  England, too, when needs must be. We decided for peace because we were  convinced that no amount of colonial aggrandizement could compensate us  for the dangers and horrors of a big European war.    Our diplomatic methods during those days may have been brusque and  annoying, but our aim was peace. Though we are held up continually as  the disturber of European peace, driven on by a mad desire for  territorial aggrandizement, we are the only big European nation which  has not increased her territory during the last twenty-five years.    Russia tried to steal the Far East and is now going half shares with  England in Persia. England annexed the Boer republics and is playing  with Russia for the Persian States.    France has taken Morocco; Italy, Tripoli; Austria-Hungary has formally  annexed Bosnia.    Even little Servia, who is praised just now as the most just and  God-fearing nation, has succeeded in wresting a large part of Macedonia,  inhabited by Bulgarians, from her Bulgarian allies.    The only conquest we went in for was an exchange of a strip of West  Africa, which we got from France as a kind of hush money, for her  Morocco policy, England, Italy, and Spain having taken their payment in  advance.    We have led no war of aggression for new territories, and we are held up  to moral contempt by all those nations who have taken their shares.    We went to war because we had to keep faith with Austria. We do not and  we did not approve of every step our ally has taken. But our idea of a  faithful alliance is not that you can chuck your partner whenever he has  made a mistake, but that you must stick to him through good and evil.    You may upbraid him privately if you dislike his methods; you may give  him a fair warning, but as long as your bargain exists you must stick to  it.    And our alliance with Austria is not a mere piece of political strategy,  not an unholy alliance like that of republican France with despotic  Russia or Anglo-Saxon England with Mongol Japan.    Our States have a common history. We are, as far as the Austrian Germans  are concerned--about a third of the population of Austria--the same  people. We have, and that is perhaps the most decisive point in the  alliance, nearly the same position on the surface of the globe.    We are both inland empires situated in the centre of Europe, surrounded  by many different nations, all of whom may bear some grudge against us.    As long as our joint frontiers are safe we can stand back to back and  face calmly any unnatural confederation like the present one.    We concluded the alliance with Austria because we wanted to safeguard  ourselves against foreign attack; it has turned out the alliance has  involved us in war. We might have avoided the war at present if we had  broken faith with our ally.    It would not have been difficult for us to find some legal quibbles,  like those which Italy, following a policy of very sober national  egotism, is now earnestly exclaiming to all the world.    If we had done so we should have been knaves, but we should have been  fools as well. For surely nobody can believe that the forces  antagonistic to Germany would have ceased to act if we had left Austria  in the lurch.    Neither France nor Russia nor England would have changed their policy.  They might, moreover, have tried to make Austria join in some future  conspiracy against us.    There are three main causes to which the war is due:    1. The French have never forgotten their defeat in 1870 and 1871. They  have always been thirsting for revenge.    2. We are at war because Russia thinks she has a mission on behalf of  the Slavic world; she feels that mission can only be fulfilled by  smashing Germany, the bulwark of Western idea.    3. We are at war because England has returned to her old political  ideals. She means to enforce anew the balance of power and she wants to  cut down Germany to that normal dead-level which alone, she thinks, is  consistent with her own security.    As far as our antagonism to France is concerned, we have always looked  upon it as a regrettable fact which time, perhaps, might do away with.  We are just enough to understand that a country like France, with a  glorious past, a gallant spirit and an undaunted courage, cannot forget  the blow we dealt her forty-three years ago.    We think we have been right in retaking from her Alsace-Lorraine,  belonging originally to the German Empire. But we look with a kind of  envy upon her who succeeded in denationalizing the people of those  provinces to such a degree that we have not yet been able to make them  Germans once more.    We have always regretted that the two most civilized nations in  Continental Europe should be rent asunder by an unforgotten past.    We hoped that the creation of a wonderful African empire might in the  long run soothe French national feeling. We should have been always  willing to come to an understanding on the existing state of affairs,  but though there have been lucky statesmen in France who tried such a"]]]
