[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1728"],[0,"The Odyssey of Homer (#13)"],[1,"Menelaus; and he went  through the palace to bear the tidings to the shepherd of  the people, and standing near spake to him winged words:    'Menelaus, fosterling of Zeus, here are two strangers,  whosoever they be, two men like to the lineage of great  Zeus. Say, shall we loose their swift horses from under the  yoke, or send them onward to some other host who shall  receive them kindly?'    Then in sore displeasure spake to him Menelaus of the fair  hair: 'Eteoneus son of Boethous, truly thou wert not a fool  aforetime, but now for this once, like a child thou talkest  folly. Surely ourselves ate much hospitable cheer of other  men, ere we twain came hither, even if in time to come Zeus  haply give us rest from affliction. Nay go, unyoke the  horses of the strangers, and as for the men, lead them  forward to the house to feast with us.'    So spake he, and Eteoneus hasted from the hall, and called  the other ready squires to follow with him. So they loosed  the sweating horses from beneath the yoke, and fastened  them at the stalls of the horses, and threw beside them  spelt, and therewith mixed white barley, and tilted the  chariot against the shining faces of the gateway, and led  the men into the hall divine. And they beheld and marvelled  as they gazed throughout the palace of the king, the  fosterling of Zeus; for there was a gleam as it were of sun  or moon through the lofty palace of renowned Menelaus. But  after they had gazed their fill, they went to the polished  baths and bathed them. Now when the maidens had bathed them  and anointed them with olive oil, and cast about them thick  cloaks and doublets, they sat on chairs by Menelaus, son of  Atreus. And a handmaid bare water for the hands in a goodly  golden ewer, and poured it forth over a silver basin to  wash withal; and to their side she drew a polished table,  and a grave dame bare food and set it by them, and laid  upon the board many dainties, giving freely of such things  as she had by her, and a carver lifted and placed by them  platters of divers kinds of flesh, and nigh them he set  golden bowls. So Menelaus of the fair hair greeted the  twain and spake:    'Taste ye food and be glad, and thereafter when ye have  supped, we will ask what men ye are; for the blood of your  parents is not lost in you, but ye are of the line of men  that are sceptred kings, the fosterlings of Zeus; for no  churls could beget sons like you.'    So spake he, and took and set before them the fat ox-chine  roasted, which they had given him as his own mess by way of  honour. And they stretched forth their hands upon the good  cheer set before them. Now when they had put from them the  desire of meat and drink Telemachus spake to the son of  Nestor, holding his head close to him, that those others  might not hear:    'Son of Nestor, delight of my heart, mark the flashing of  bronze through the echoing halls, and the flashing of gold  and of amber and of silver and of ivory. Such like,  methinks, is the court of Olympian Zeus within, for the  world of things that are here; wonder comes over me as I  look thereon.'    And as he spake Menelaus of the fair hair was ware of him,  and uttering his voice spake to them winged words:    'Children dear, of a truth no one of mortal men may contend  with Zeus, for his mansions and his treasures are  everlasting: but of men there may be who will vie with me  in treasure, or there may be none. Yea, for after many a  woe and wanderings manifold, I brought my wealth home in  ships, and in the eighth year came hither. I roamed over  Cyprus and Phoenicia and Egypt, and reached the Aethiopians  and Sidonians and Erembi and Libya, where lambs are horned  from the birth. For there the ewes yean thrice within the  full circle of a year; there neither lord nor shepherd  lacketh aught of cheese or flesh or of sweet milk, but ever  the flocks yield store of milk continual. While I was yet  roaming in those lands, gathering much livelihood, meantime  another slew my brother privily, at unawares, by the guile  of his accursed wife. Thus, look you, I have no joy of my  lordship among these my possessions: and ye are like to  have heard hereof from your fathers, whosoever they be, for  I have suffered much and let a house go to ruin that was  stablished fair, and had in it much choice substance. I  would that I had but a third part of those my riches, and  dwelt in my halls, and that those men were yet safe, who  perished of old in the wide land of Troy, far from Argos,  the pastureland of horses. Howbeit, though I bewail them  all and sorrow oftentimes as I sit in our halls,--awhile  indeed I satisfy my soul with lamentation, and then again I  cease; for soon hath man enough of chill lamentation--yet  for them all I make no such dole, despite my grief, as for  one only, who causes me to loathe both sleep and meat, when  I think upon him. For no one of the Achaeans toiled so  greatly as Odysseus toiled and adventured himself: but to  him it was to be but labour and trouble, and to me grief  ever comfortless for his sake, so long he is afar, nor know  we aught, whether he be alive or dead. Yea methinks they  lament him, even that old Laertes and the constant Penelope  and Telemachus, whom he left a child new-born in his  house.'    So spake he, and in the heart of Telemachus he stirred a  yearning to lament his father; and at his father's name he  let a tear fall from his eyelids to the ground, and held up  his purple mantle with both his hands before his eyes. And  Menelaus marked him and mused in his mind and his heart  whether he should leave him to speak of his father, or  first question him and prove him in every word.    While yet he pondered these things in his mind and in his  heart, Helen came forth from her fragrant vaulted chamber,  like Artemis of the golden arrows; and with her came  Adraste and set for her the well-wrought chair, and Alcippe  bare a rug of soft wool, and Phylo bare a silver basket  which Alcandre gave her, the wife of Polybus, who dwelt in  Thebes of Egypt, where is the chiefest store of wealth in  the houses. He gave two silver baths to Menelaus, and  tripods twain, ad ten talents of gold. And besides all  this, his wife bestowed on Helen lovely gifts; a golden  distaff did she give, and a silver basket with wheels  beneath, and the rims thereof were finished with gold. This  it was that the handmaid Phylo bare and set beside her,  filled with dressed yarn, and across it was laid a distaff  charged with wool of violet blue. So Helen sat her down in  the chair, and beneath was a footstool for the feet. And  anon she spake to her lord and questioned him of each  thing:    'Menelaus, fosterling of Zeus, know we now who these men  avow themselves to be that have come under our roof? Shall  I dissemble or shall I speak the truth? Nay, I am minded to  tell it. None, I say, have I ever yet seen so like another,  man or woman--wonder comes over me as I look on him--as  this man is like the son of great-hearted Odysseus,  Telemachus, whom he left a new born child in his house,  when for the sake of me, shameless woman that I was, ye  Achaeans came up under Troy with bold war in your hearts.'    And Menelaus of the fair hair answered her, saying: 'Now I  too, lady, mark the likeness even as thou tracest it. For  such as these were his feet, such his hands, and the  glances of his eyes, and his head, and his hair withal.  Yea, and even now I was speaking of Odysseus, as I  remembered him, of all his woeful travail for my sake;  when, lo, he let fall a bitter tear beneath his brows, and  held his purple cloak up before his eyes.'    And Peisistratus, son of Nestor, answered him, saying:  'Menelaus, son of Atreus, fosterling of Zeus, leader of the  host, assuredly this is the son of that very man, even as  thou sayest. But he is of a sober wit, and thinketh it  shame in his heart as on this his first coming to make show  of presumptuous words in the presence of thee, in whose  voice we twain delight as in the voice of a god. Now Nestor  of Gerenia, lord of chariots, sent me forth to be his guide  on the way: for he desired to see thee that thou mightest  put into his heart some word or work. For a son hath many  griefs in his halls when his father is away, if perchance  he hath none to stand by him. Even so it is now with  Telemachus; his father is away, nor hath he others in the  township to defend him from distress.'    And Menelaus of the fair hair answered him, and said: 'Lo  now, in good truth there has come unto my house the son of  a friend indeed, who for my sake endured many adventures.  And I thought to welcome him on his coming more nobly than  all the other Argives, if but Olympian Zeus, of the  far-borne voice, had vouchsafed us a return over the sea in  our swift ships,--that such a thing should be. And in Argos  I would have given him a city to dwell in, and stablished  for him a house, and brought him forth from Ithaca with his  substance and his son and all his people, making one city  desolate of those that lie around, and are in mine own  domain. Then ofttimes would we have held converse here, and  nought would have parted us, the welcoming and the  welcomed, {*} ere the black cloud of death overshadowed us.  Howsoever, the god himself, methinks, must have been  jealous hereof, who from that hapless man alone cut off his  returning.'    {* Mr. Evelyn Abbott of Balliol College has suggested to us  that [Greek] and [Greek] are here correlatives, and denote  respectively the parts of host and of guest. This is  sufficiently borne out by the usage of the words  elsewhere.}    So spake he, and in the hearts of all he stirred the desire  of lamentation. She wept, even Argive Helen the daughter of  Zeus, and Telemachus wept, and Menelaus the son of Atreus;  nay, nor did the son of Nestor keep tearless eyes. For he  bethought him in his heart of noble Antilochus, whom the  glorious son of the bright"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17280"],[0,"Anthropology (#13)"],[1,"could  acclimatize themselves in India at the price of an immense toll of  infant lives; but it is a price which they show no signs of being willing  to pay.    What, then, are the limits of the geographical control? Where does  its influence begin and end? Situation, race and culture--to reduce  it to a problem of three terms only--which of the three, if any, in  the long run controls the rest? Remember that the anthropologist is  trying to be the historian of long perspective. History which counts  by years, proto-history which counts by centuries, pre-history which  counts by millenniums--he seeks to embrace them all. He sees the  English in India, on the one hand, and in Australia on the other. Will  the one invasion prove an incident, he asks, and the other an event,  as judged by a history of long perspective? Or, again, there are whites  and blacks and redskins in the southern portion of the United States  of America, having at present little in common save a common climate.  Different races, different cultures, a common geographical  situation--what net result will these yield for the historian of  patient, far-seeing anthropological outlook? Clearly there is here  something worth the puzzling out. But we cannot expect to puzzle it  out all at once.    In these days geography, in the form known as anthropo-geography, is  putting forth claims to be the leading branch of anthropology. And,  doubtless, a thorough grounding in geography must henceforth be part  of the anthropologist's equipment.[3] The schools of Ratzel in Germany  and Le Play in France are, however, fertile in generalizations that  are far too pretty to be true. Like other specialists, they exaggerate  the importance of their particular brand of work. The full meaning  of life can never be expressed in terms of its material conditions.  I confess that I am not deeply moved when Ratzel announces that man  is a piece of the earth. Or when his admirers, anxious to improve on  this, after distinguishing the atmosphere or air, the hydrosphere or  water, the lithosphere or crust, and the centrosphere or interior mass,  proceed to add that man is the most active portion of an intermittent  biosphere, or living envelope of our planet, I cannot feel that the  last word has been said about him.    [Footnote 3: Thus the reader of the present work should not fail to  study also Dr. Marion Newbigin's _Geography_ in this series.]    Or, again, listen for a moment to M. Demolins, author of a very  suggestive book, _Comment la route cree le type social_ (\"How the road  creates the social type\"). \"There exists,\" he says in his preface,  \"on the surface of the terrestrial globe an infinite variety of peoples.  What is the cause that has created this variety? In general the reply  is, Race. But race explains nothing; for it remains to discover what  has produced the diversity of races. Race is not a cause; it is a  consequence. The first and decisive cause of the diversity of peoples  and of the diversity of races is the road that the peoples have followed.  It is the road that creates the race, and that creates the social type.\"  And he goes further: \"If the history of humanity were to recommence,  and the surface of the globe had not been transformed, this history  would repeat itself in its main lines. There might well be secondary  differences, for example, in certain manifestations of public life,  in political revolutions, to which we assign far too great an  importance; but the same roads would reproduce the same social types,  and would impose on them the same essential characters.\"    There is no contending with a pious opinion, especially when it takes  the form of an unverifiable prophecy. Let the level-headed  anthropologist beware, however, lest he put all his eggs into one  basket. Let him seek to give each factor in the problem its due. Race  must count for something, or why do not the other animals take a leaf  out of our book and build up rival civilizations on suitable sites?  Why do men herd cattle, instead of the cattle herding the men? We are  rational beings, in other words, because we have it in us to be rational  beings. Again, culture, with the intelligence and choice it involves,  counts for something too. It is easy to argue that, since there were  the Asiatic steppes with the wild horses ready to hand in them, man  was bound sooner or later to tame the horse and develop the  characteristic culture of the nomad type. Yes, but why did man tame  the horse later rather than sooner? And why did the American redskins  never tame the bison, and adopt a pastoral life in their vast prairies?  Or why do modern black folk and white folk alike in Africa fail to  utilize the elephant? Is it because these things cannot be done, or  because man has not found out how to do them?    When all allowances, however, are made for the exaggerations almost  pardonable in a branch of science still engaged in pushing its way  to the front, anthropo-geography remains a far-reaching method of  historical study which the anthropologist has to learn how to use.  To put it crudely, he must learn how to work all the time with a map  of the earth at his elbow.    First of all, let him imagine his world of man stationary. Let him  plot out in turn the distribution of heat, of moisture, of diseases,  of vegetation, of food-animals, of the physical types of man, of  density of population, of industries, of forms of government, of  religions, of languages, and so on and so forth. How far do these  different distributions bear each other out? He will find a number  of things that go together in what will strike him as a natural way.  For instance, all along the equator, whether in Africa or South America  or Borneo, he will find them knocking off work in the middle of the  day in order to take a siesta. On the other hand, other things will  not agree so well. Thus, though all will be dark-skinned, the South  Americans will be coppery, the Africans black, and the men of Borneo  yellow.    Led on by such discrepancies, perhaps, he will want next to set his  world of man in movement. He will thereupon perceive a circulation,  so to speak, amongst the various peoples, suggestive of interrelations  of a new type. Now so long as he is dealing in descriptions of a detached  kind, concerning not merely the physical environment, but likewise  the social adjustments more immediately corresponding thereto, he will  be working at the geographical level. Directly it comes, however, to  a generalized description or historical explanation, as when he seeks  to show that here rather than there a civilization is likely to arise,  geographical considerations proper will not suffice. Distribution is  merely one aspect of evolution. Yet that it is a very important aspect  will now be shown by a hasty survey of the world according to  geographical regions.           *       *       *       *       *    Let us begin with Europe, so as to proceed gradually from the more  known to the less known. Lecky has spoken of \"the European epoch of  the human mind.\" What is the geographical and physical theatre of that  epoch? We may distinguish--I borrow the suggestion from Professor  Myres--three stages in its development. Firstly, there was the  river-phase; next, the Mediterranean phase; lastly, the present-day  Atlantic phase. Thus, to begin with, the valleys of the Nile and  Euphrates were each the home of civilizations both magnificent and  enduring. They did not spring up spontaneously, however. If the rivers  helped man, man also helped the rivers by inventing systems of  irrigation. Next, from Minoan days right on to the end of the Middle  Ages, the Mediterranean basin was the focus of all the higher life  in the world, if we put out of sight the civilizations of India and  China, together with the lesser cultures of Peru and Mexico. I will  consider this second phase especially, because it is particularly  instructive from the geographical standpoint. Finally, since the time  of the discovery of America, the sea-trade, first called into existence  as a civilizing agent by Mediterranean conditions, has shifted its  base to the Atlantic coast, and especially to that land of natural  harbours, the British Isles. We must give up thinking in terms of an  Eastern and Western Hemisphere. The true distinction, as applicable  to modern times, is between a land-hemisphere, with the Atlantic coast  of Europe as its centre, and a sea-hemisphere, roughly coinciding with  the Pacific. The Pacific is truly an ocean; but the Atlantic is becoming  more of a \"herring-pond\" every day.    Fixing our eyes, then, on the Mediterranean basin, with its Black Sea  extension, it is easy to perceive that we have here a well-defined  geographical province, capable of acting as an area of  characterization as perhaps no other in the world, once its various  peoples had the taste and ingenuity to intermingle freely by way of  the sea. The first fact to note is the completeness of the ring-fence  that shuts it in. From the Pyrenees right along to Ararat runs the  great Alpine fold, like a ridge in a crumpled table-cloth; the Spanish  Sierras and the Atlas continue the circle to the south-west; and the  rest is desert. Next, the configuration of the coasts makes for  intercourse by sea, especially on the northern side with its peninsulas  and islands, the remains of a foundered and drowned mountain-country.  This same configuration, considered in connection with the flora and  fauna that are favoured by the climate, goes far to explain that  discontinuity of the political life which encouraged independence  whilst it prevented self-sufficiency. The forest-belt, owing to the  dry summer, lay towards the snow-line, and below it a scrub-belt,  yielding poor hunting, drove men to grow their corn and olives and  vines in the least swampy of the lowlands, scattered like mere oases  amongst the hills and promontories.
