So the sparrow boy, the grasshopper and old Percival, the circus dog,  started off together to see poor sick Peetie Bow Wow, leaving Uncle  Wiggily there on the grass.    \"Give my love to Peetie!\" called the old gentleman rabbit after them,  \"and tell him that I'll come and see him as soon as I find my fortune.\"    Uncle Wiggily felt a little bit sad and lonely when his friends were gone,  but he ate another piece of cherry pie, taking care to get none of the  juice, on his blue necktie, and then he was a little happier.    \"Now to start off once more,\" he said. \"I wonder what will happen next?  But I know one thing, I'm never going to do any jumping for any squatty  old toads any more.\"    So Uncle Wiggily traveled on and on, and when it came night he didn't have  any place to sleep. But as it happened he met a kind old water snake, who  had a nice house in an old pile of wood, and there the rabbit stayed until  morning, when the water snake got him a nice breakfast of pond lilies,  with crinkly eel-grass sauce on.    Pretty soon it was nearly noon that day, and Uncle Wiggily was about to  sit down on a nice green mossy bank in the woods--not a toy bank with  money in it, you understand, but a dirt-bank, with moss on it like a  carpet. That's where he was going to sit.    \"I think I'll eat my dinner,\" said the old gentleman rabbit as he opened  his valise, and just then he heard a voice in the woods singing. And this  was the song:        \"Oh dear! I'm lost, I know I am,        I don't know what to do.      I had a big red ribbon, and        I had one colored blue.        But now I haven't got a one        Because a savage bear      Took both of them, and tied a string        Around my curly hair.        I wish I had a penny bright,        To buy a trolley car.      I'd ride home then, because, you see,        To walk it is too far.\"    \"I guess that's some one in trouble, all right,\" said Uncle Wiggily, as he  cautiously peeped through the bushes. \"Though, perhaps, it is a little  wolf boy, or a fox.\" But when he looked, whom should he see but little  Jennie Chipmunk, and she was crying as hard as she could cry, so she  couldn't sing any more.    \"Why, Jennie, what is the matter?\" kindly asked Uncle Wiggily.    \"Oh, I came out in the woods to gather acorns in a little basket for  supper,\" she said, \"and I guess I must have come too far. The first thing  I knew a big bear jumped out of the bushes at me, and he took off both my  nice, new hair ribbons and put on this old string.\"    And, sure enough, there was only just an old black shoestring on Jennie's  nice hair.    \"Where is that bear?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, quite savage like. \"Just tell  me where he is, and I'll make him give you back those ribbons, and then  I'll show you the way home.\"    \"Oh, the bear ran off after he scared me,\" said the little chipmunk girl.  \"Please don't look for him, Uncle Wiggily, or he might eat you all up.\"    \"Pooh!\" exclaimed the old gentleman rabbit. \"I'm not afraid of a bear. I  have traveled around a great deal of late, and I have had many adventures.  It takes more than a bear to scare me!\"    \"Oh, it does; does it?\" suddenly cried a growly-scowly voice, and, would  you believe me? right out from the bushes jumped that savage bear! And he  had Jennie's blue ribbon tied on his left ear, and the red one tied on his  right ear, and he looked too queer for anything. \"I can't scare you; eh?\"  he cried to the rabbit. \"Well, I'm just going to eat you, and that  chipmunk girl all up, and maybe that will scare you!\"    So he made a jump for Uncle Wiggily, but do you s'pose the rabbit  gentleman was afraid? Not a bit of it. He knew what he was going to do.    \"Quick, Jennie!\" called Uncle Wiggily. \"Get in front of me. I'll fix this  bear all right.\" So Jennie got in front, and the rabbit turned his back on  the bear, and, then Uncle Wiggily began scratching in the dirt with his  sharp claws. My! how he did make the dirt fly. It was just like a regular  rain-shower of sand and gravel.    And the dirt flew all over that bear; in his eyes and nose and mouth and  ears, it went, and he sneezed, and he couldn't see out of his eyes, and he  fairly howled. And by that time Uncle Wiggily had dug a big hole in the  ground with his feet, and he and Jennie hid there until the bear ran off  to get some water to wash the dirt off his face, and then the rabbit and  the chipmunk girl came out safely.    Then Uncle Wiggily gave Jennie some pennies to buy two new hair ribbons,  and he showed her the way home with her basket of acorns, and he himself  went on with his travels. And he had another adventure the next day. Now  in case a cowboy doesn't come along, and take my little pussy cat off to  the wild west show I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the paper  lantern.          STORY XIX    UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LANTERN      After Uncle Wiggily had taken Jennie Chipmunk home, so that the bear  couldn't get her, as I told you about in the story before this one, the  old gentleman rabbit walked on over the fields and through the woods,  seeking his fortune. He looked everywhere for it; down in hollow stumps,  behind big stones, and even in an old well, but you may be sure he didn't  jump down any more wells. No, I guess not!    \"Ha! Here is a little brook!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, after a while, as  he came to a small stream of water flowing over green, mossy stones, with  a nice gurgling sound like an ice cream soda, \"perhaps I may find my  fortune here.\"    But he looked and he looked in the water without seeing anything but a  goldfish.    \"I might sell the goldfish for money,\" thought the fortune-hunting rabbit,  \"but it wouldn't be kind to take him out of the brook, so I won't. I'll  look a little farther, on the other side.\"    Then, taking up his crutch and his valise, Uncle Wiggily gave a big jump,  and leaped safely across the water. Then, once more, he traveled on.  Pretty soon he came to a place where there was a tree, and on one branch  of this tree there hung a funny round ball, that looked as if it was made  of gray-colored paper. And there was a funny buzzing sound coming from it.    \"Ha! Do you see that?\" asked a big, fat hop-toad, as he suddenly bobbed up  out of the grass. It was the same toad who had made the rabbit jump down  in the leaf-covered well. \"Do you see that?\" asked the toad.    \"Well, if you want to find your fortune, take a stick and hit that ball.\"    \"Indeed I will not!\" cried the old gentleman rabbit. \"I know you and your  tricks! That is a hornets' nest, and if I struck it they would fly out,  and sting me. Oh, no! You can't catch me again. Now you go away, or I'll  tell a policeman dog to arrest you.\"    So the toad knew it was of no use to try to fool Uncle Wiggily again, and  he hopped away, scratching his warty back on a sharp stone.    Well, the old gentleman rabbit traveled on and on, and when it came night  he wondered where he was going to stay, for he hadn't yet found his  fortune and the weather looked as if it was going to rain. Then, all of a  sudden, he heard voices calling like this:    \"Come on, Nannie, you've got to blind your eyes now, and I'll go hide.\"    \"All right, Billie,\" was the answer. \"And after that we'll get Uncle  Butter to tell us a story.\"    \"I guess I know who those children are,\" thought Uncle Wiggily, though he  had not yet seen them. \"That's Billie and Nannie Goat talking,\" and surely  enough it was, and, most unexpectedly the rabbit had come right up to the  house where they lived, on the edge of the woods.    Well, you can just imagine how glad Billie and Nannie were to see Uncle  Wiggily.    They danced all around him, and held him by the paws, and kissed him  between his long ears, and Billie carried his satchel for him.    \"Oh, we're so glad you are here!\" they cried. \"Mamma! Papa! Uncle Butter!  Here is Uncle Wiggily!\"    Well, the whole goat family was glad to see the rabbit-traveler, and after  supper he told them of his adventures, and how he was out seeking his  fortune.    And Billie and Nannie told what they had been doing, and Nannie showed how  she could cut things out of paper, like the children do in the  kindergarten class in school. She could make little houses, with smoke  coming out of the chimney, and paper lanterns, and boxes, and, oh! ever so  many things. The lanterns she made were especially fine, just like Chinese  ones.    Then it came time to go to bed, and in the night a very strange thing  happened, and I'm going to tell you all about it.    Along about 12 o'clock, when all was still and quiet, and when the little  mice were beginning to think it was time for them to creep, creep out of  their holes, and hunt for bread and cheese; about this time there sounded  a queer noise down at the front door of the goat-house.    \"Ha! What is that?\" asked Mrs. Goat.    \"I guess it was the cats,\" said Mr. Goat, getting ready to go to sleep  again.    \"No, I'm sure it was a burglar-fox!\" said the lady goat. \"Please get up  and look.\"    Well, of course, Mr. Goat had to do so, after his wife asked him like  that. So he poked his head out of the upstairs window, over the front  door, and he called out:    \"Who is down there?\"    \"I'm a burglar-fox!\" was the answer. \"I'm coming to rob you.\"    \"Oh, my!\" cried Mrs. Goat, when she heard that. \"Get a gun, and shoot him,  Mr. Goat.\"    And at that Billie and Nannie began to cry, for they were afraid of  burglars, and Uncle Butter got up, and began looking for a whistle, with  which to call a policeman dog, but he couldn't find it.    Then the burglar-fox started in breaking down the door, so that he could  get in, and still Mr. Goat couldn't find his gun.    \"Oh, we'll all be killed!\" cried Mrs. Goat. \"Oh, if some one would only  help us!\"    \"Ha! I will help you!\" cried Uncle Wiggily"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15293"],[0,"Influences of Geographic Environment (#13)"],[1,"advantages led the early Russian merchants to build up a town  at nearby Novgorod, in easy water connection with the Baltic  commerce.[74]    [Sidenote: Economic and social effects.]    III. Geographic conditions influence the economic and social development  of a people by the abundance, paucity, or general character of the  natural resources, by the local ease or difficulty of securing the  necessaries of life, and by the possibility of industry and commerce  afforded by the environment. From the standpoint of production and  exchange, these influences are primarily the subject matter of economic  and commercial geography; but since they also permeate national life,  determine or modify its social structure, condemn it to the dwarfing  effects of national poverty, or open to it the cultural and political  possibilities resident in national wealth, they are legitimate material  also for anthropo-geography.    [Sidenote: Size of the social group.]    They are especially significant because they determine the size of the  social group. This must be forever small in areas of limited resources  or of limited extent, as in the little islands of the world and the yet  smaller oases. The desert of Chinese Turkestan supports, in certain  detached spots of river-born fertility, populations like the 60,000 of  Kashgar, and from this size groups all the way down to the single  families which Younghusband found living by a mere trickle of a stream  flowing down the southern slope of the Tian Shan. Small islands,  according to their size, fertility, and command of trade, may harbor a  sparse and scant population, like the five hundred souls struggling for  an ill-fed existence on the barren Westman Isles of Iceland; or a  compact, teeming, yet absolutely small social group, like that crowding  Malta or the Bermudas. Whether sparsely or compactly distributed, such  groups suffer the limitations inherent in their small size. They are  forever excluded from the historical significance attaching to the  large, continuously distributed populations of fertile continental  lands.    [Sidenote: Effect upon movements of peoples.]    IV. The next class belongs exclusively to the domain of geography,  because it embraces the influence of the features of the earth's surface  in directing the movements and ultimate distribution of mankind. It  includes the effect of natural barriers, like mountains, deserts,  swamps, and seas, in obstructing or deflecting the course of migrating  people and in giving direction to national expansion; it considers the  tendency of river valleys and treeless plains to facilitate such  movements, the power of rivers, lakes, bays and oceans either to block  the path or open a highway, according as navigation is in a primitive or  advanced stage; and finally the influence of all these natural features  in determining the territory which a people is likely to occupy, and the  boundaries which shall separate from their neighbors.    [Sidenote: River routes.]    The lines of expansion followed by the French and English in the  settlement of America and also the extent of territory covered by each  were powerfully influenced by geographic conditions. The early French  explorers entered the great east-west waterway of the St. Lawrence River  and the Great Lakes, which carried them around the northern end of the  Appalachian barrier into the heart of the continent, planted them on the  low, swampy, often navigable watershed of the Mississippi, and started  them on another river voyage of nearly two thousand miles to the Gulf of  Mexico. Here were the conditions and temptation for almost unlimited  expansion; hence French Canada reached to the head of Lake Superior, and  French Louisiana to the sources of the Missouri, To the lot of the  English fell a series of short rivers with fertile valleys, nearly  barred at their not distant sources by a wall of forested mountains, but  separated from one another by low watersheds which facilitated lateral  expansion over a narrow belt between mountains and sea. Here a region of  mild climate and fertile soil suited to agriculture, enclosed by strong  natural boundaries, made for compact settlement, in contrast to the wide  diffusion of the French. Later, when a growing population pressed  against the western barrier, mountain gates opened at Cumberland Gap and  the Mohawk Valley; the Ohio River and the Great Lakes became interior  thoroughfares, and the northwestern prairies lines of least resistance  to the western settler. Rivers played the same part in directing and  expediting this forward movement, as did the Lena and the Amoor in the  Russian advance into Siberia, the Humber and the Trent in the progress  of the Angles into the heart of Britain, the Rhone and Danube in the  march of the Romans into central Europe.    [Sidenote: Segregation and accessibility.]    The geographical environment of a people may be such as to segregate  them from others, and thereby to preserve or even intensify their  natural characteristics; or it may expose them to extraneous influences,  to an infusion of new blood and new ideas, till their peculiarities are  toned down, their distinctive features of dialect or national dress or  provincial customs eliminated, and the people as a whole approach to the  composite type of civilized humanity. A land shut off by mountains or  sea from the rest of the world tends to develop a homogeneous people,  since it limits or prevents the intrusion of foreign elements; or when  once these are introduced, it encourages their rapid assimilation by the  strongly interactive life of a confined locality. Therefore large or  remote islands are, as a rule, distinguished by the unity of their  inhabitants in point of civilization and race characteristics. Witness  Great Britain, Ireland, Japan, Iceland, as also Australia and New  Zealand at the time of their discovery. The highlands of the Southern  Appalachians, which form the \"mountain backyards\" of Kentucky, Tennessee  and North Carolina, are peopled by the purest English stock in the  United States, descendants of the backwoodsmen of the late eighteenth  century. Difficulty of access and lack of arable land have combined to  discourage immigration. In consequence, foreign elements, including the  elsewhere ubiquitous negro, are wanting, except along the few railroads  which in recent years have penetrated this country. Here survive an  eighteenth century English, Christmas celebrated on Twelfth Night, the  spinning wheel, and a belief in Joshua's power to arrest the course of  the sun.[75]    An easily accessible land is geographically hospitable to all  new-comers, facilitates the mingling of peoples, the exchange of  commodities and ideas. The amalgamation of races in such regions depends  upon the similarity or diversity of the ethnic elements and the duration  of the common occupation. The broad, open valley of the Danube from the  Black Sea to Vienna contains a bizarre mixture of several stocks--Turks,  Bulgarians, various families of pure Slavs, Roumanians, Hungarians, and  Germans. These elements are too diverse and their occupation of the  valley too recent for amalgamation to have advanced very far as yet. The  maritime plain and open river valleys of northern France show a complete  fusion of the native Celts with the Saxons, Franks, and Normans who have  successively drifted into the region, just as the Teutonic and scanter  Slav elements have blended in the Baltic plains from the Elbe to the  Vistula.    [Sidenote: Change of habitat.]    Here are four different classes of geographic influences, all which may  become active in modifying a people when it changes its habitat. Many of  the characteristics acquired in the old home still live on, or at best  yield slowly to the new environment. This is especially true of the  direct physical and psychical effects. But a country may work a prompt  and radical change in the social organization of an immigrant people by  the totally new conditions of economic life which it presents. These may  be either greater wealth or poverty of natural resources than the race  has previously known, new stimulants or deterrents to commerce and  intercourse, and new conditions of climate which affect the efficiency  of the workman and the general character of production. From these a  whole complex mass of secondary effects may follow.    The Aryans and Mongols, leaving their homes in the cool barren highlands  of Central Asia where nature dispensed her gifts with a miserly hand,  and coming down to the hot, low, fertile plains of the Indian rivers,  underwent several fundamental changes in the process of adaptation to  their new environment. An enervating climate did its work in slaking  their energies; but more radical still was the change wrought by the  contrast of poverty and abundance, enforced asceticism and luxury,  presented by the old and new home. The restless, tireless shepherds  became a sedentary, agricultural people; the abstemious nomads,--spare,  sinewy, strangers to indulgence--became a race of rulers, revelling in  luxury, lording it over countless subjects; finally, their numbers  increased rapidly, no longer kept down by the scant subsistence of arid  grasslands and scattered oases.    In a similar way, the Arab of the desert became transformed into the  sedentary lord of Spain. In the luxuriance of field and orchard which  his skilful methods of irrigation and tillage produced, in the growing  predominance of the intellectual over the nomadic military life, of the  complex affairs of city and mart over the simple tasks of herdsman or  cultivator, he lost the benefit of the early harsh training and  therewith his hold upon his Iberian empire.
