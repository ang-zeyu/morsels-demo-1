Little by little the manner of that Lord of hearts, what He did  and what He did not do, and the sight of His lovesome face, had its  effect; they began to thirst after the Faith and to seek His grace and  favor. They presented themselves at the door of His house, as if they were  flowers blooming there; and they were soon enamored of the light that  shone out from His brow, captives of the beauty of that dear Companion.  They needed no teacher, then; by themselves, they saw through the veils  that had blinded them before, and won the supreme desire of their hearts.    As commanded by the Blessed Beauty, Mirza Javad of Tur_sh_iz went to their  house one night. Mirza Javad had hardly opened his mouth when they  accepted the Faith. They did not hesitate for an instant, for they had  amazing receptivity. This is what is meant by the Qur'anic verse:  \"...whose oil would well nigh shine out, even though fire touched it not!  It is light upon light.\"(44) That is, this oil is so fully prepared, so  ready to be lit, that it almost catches fire of itself, though no flame be  at hand; which means that the capacity for faith, and the deserving it,  can be so great, that without the communication of a single word the light  shines forth. This is how it was with those pure-hearted men; truly they  were loyal, staunch, and devoted to God.    The eldest brother, Muhammad-Sadiq, accompanied Baha'u'llah from 'Iraq to  Constantinople, and from there to Adrianople, where he lived happily for  some time, close to his Lord. He was humble, long-suffering, thankful;  there was always a smile on his lips; he was light of heart, and his soul  was in love with Baha'u'llah. Later he was given leave to return to 'Iraq,  for his family was there, and he remained in that city for a while,  dreaming and remembering.    Then a great calamity occurred in 'Iraq, and all four brothers with their  noble uncle were taken prisoner. Victimized, captive, they were brought to  Mosul. The uncle, Aqa Muhammad-Rida, was an old man, illumined of mind,  spiritual of heart, a man detached from all worldly things. He had been  extremely rich in 'Iraq, enjoying comforts and pleasures, but now in  Hadba--Mosul--he became the chief victim among the prisoners, and suffered  dire need. He was destitute, but remained dignified, patient, content, and  thankful. Keeping to himself in an out-of-the-way place, he praised God  day and night until he died. He gave up his heart to his heart's Love,  burst from the shackles of this inconstant world and ascended to the  Kingdom that endures forever. May God immerse him in the waters of  forgiveness, make him to enter the garden of His compassion and good  pleasure, and keep him in Paradise till the end of time.    As for Muhammad-Sadiq, he too, in Mosul, was subjected to hardships on  God's path. He too was a soul at rest, well-pleased with his Lord and  well-pleasing unto Him. In the end he too replied to the voice of the King  of Glory: \"Lord, here am I!\" and came to fulfill the verses: \"O thou soul  who art well-assured, return unto thy Lord, well-pleased, and  well-pleasing unto Him. Enter thou among My servants; enter Thou My  Paradise.\"(45)    And Muhammad-'Ali, once he was freed from captivity, hastened from Mosul  to the Holy Land, to the precincts of inexhaustible grace. Here he still  lives. Although he suffers hardship, his heart is at peace. As for his  brother Ibrahim, referred to above, he also came on from Mosul to Akka,  but to a region close by. There with patience, calm, contentment, but  difficulty, he engaged in trade, meanwhile mourning the ascension of  Baha'u'llah by day and night. Lowly and contrite, with his face turned  toward the mysterious realms of God, he wore his life away. At the end,  consumed by the years, hardly able to move about, he came to Haifa, where  he found a corner of the travelers' hospice to live in, and spent his time  humbly calling upon God, entreating Him, offering praise. Little by  little, eaten away with age, his person began its dissolution, and at the  end he stripped off the garment of flesh and with his unclothed spirit  took flight to the realm of the All-Merciful. He was transported out of  this dark life into the shining air, and was plunged in a sea of lights.  May God brighten his grave with spreading rays, and lull his spirit with  the fannings of Divine compassion. Upon him be the mercy of God, and His  good pleasure.    As for Aqa Habibu'llah, he too was made a captive in 'Iraq and was  banished away to Mosul. For a long time, he lived in that city, subjected  to hardships, but remaining content, and his faith increasing day by day.  When famine came to Mosul life was harder than ever on the outsiders, but  in the remembrance of God their hearts were at rest,(46) and their souls  ate of food from Heaven. Thus they endured it all with astonishing  patience, and the people wondered at those strangers in their midst who  were neither distressed nor terrified as the others were, and who  continued to offer praise day and night. \"What amazing trust,\" the people  said, \"they have in God!\"    Habib was a man with a great store of patience and a joyous heart. He  accustomed himself to exile and he lived in a state of yearning love.  After the departure from Ba_gh_dad, the prisoners of Mosul were constantly  made mention of by Baha'u'llah; with regard to them, He expressed His  infinite favor. A few years afterward, Habib hastened away to the  encompassing mercy of God, and found a nest and refuge on the boughs of  the celestial Tree. There, in the Paradise of all delights, with wondrous  songs he poured out his praise of the bountiful Lord.            AQA MUHAMMAD-IBRAHIM      Muhammad-Ibrahim, who bore the title of Mansur--Victorious--was a  coppersmith. This man of God, yet another among the emigrants and  settlers, was a native of Ka_sh_an. In the early flowering of his youth he  recognized the newborn Light and drank deep of the holy cup that is  \"tempered at the camphor fountain.\"(47) He was a man of pleasing  disposition, full of zest and the joy of life. As soon as the light of  faith was lit in his heart, he left Ka_sh_an, journeyed to Ba_gh_dad, and  was honored with coming into the presence of Baha'u'llah.    Aqa Muhammad had a fine poetic gift, and he would create verses like  stringed pearls. In Zawra--that is, Ba_gh_dad, the Abode of Peace--he was on  amicable terms with friend and stranger alike, ever striving to show forth  loving-kindness to all. He brought his brothers from Persia to Ba_gh_dad,  and opened a shop for arts and crafts, applying himself to the welfare of  others. He, too, was taken prisoner and exiled from Ba_gh_dad to Mosul,  after which he journeyed to Haifa, where day and night, lowly and humble,  he chanted prayers and supplications and centered his thoughts on God.    He remained a long time in Haifa, successfully serving the believers  there, and most humbly and unobtrusively seeing to the travelers' needs.  He married in that city, and fathered fine children. To him every day was  a new life and a new joy, and whatever money he made he spent on strangers  and friends. After the slaying of the King of Martyrs, he wrote an elegy  to memorialize that believer who had fallen on the field of anguish, and  recited his ode in the presence of Baha'u'llah; the lines were touching in  the extreme, so that all who were there shed tears, and voices were raised  in grief.    Aqa Muhammad continued to live out his life, high of aim, unvarying as to  his inner condition, with fervor and love. Then he welcomed death,  laughing like a rose suddenly full-blown, and crying, \"Here am I!\" Thus he  quitted Haifa, exchanging it for the world above. From this narrow slip of  land he hastened upward to the Well-Beloved, soared out of this dust heap  to pitch his tent in a fair and shining place. Blessings be unto him, and  a goodly home.(48) May God sheathe him in mercies; may he rest under the  tabernacles of forgiveness and be brought into the gardens of Heaven.            ZAYNU'L-ABIDIN YAZDI      One of the emigrants who died along the way to the Holy Land was  Zaynu'l-Abidin of Yazd. When, in Man_sh_ad, this devoted man first heard  the cry of God, he was awakened to restless life. A holy passion stirred  him, his soul was made new. The light of guidance flamed from the lamp of  his heart; the love of God sparked a revolution in the country of his  inner self. Carried away by love for the Loved One's beauty, he left the  home that was dear to him and set out for the Desired Land.    As he traveled along with his two sons, gladdened by hopes of the meeting  that would be his, he paused on every hilltop, in every plain, village and  hamlet to visit with the friends. But the great distance stretching out  before him changed to a sea of troubles, and although his spirit yearned,  his body weakened, and at the end he sickened and turned helpless; all  this when he was without a home.    Sick as he was, he did not renounce the journey, nor fail in his resolve;  he had amazing strength of will, and was determined to keep on; but the  illness worsened with every passing day, until at last he winged his way  to the mercy of God, and yielded up his soul in a longing unfulfilled.    Although to outward eyes he never drained the cup of meeting, never gazed  upon the beauty of Baha'u'llah, still he achieved the very spirit of  spiritual communion; he is accounted as one of those who attained the  Presence, and for him the reward of those who reached that Presence is  fixed and ordained. He was a stainless soul, faithful, devoted and true.  He never drew a breath except in righteousness, and his single desire was  to worship his Lord. He walked the ways of love; he was known to all for  steadfast loyalty and pure intent. May God fill up reunion's cup for him "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19282"],[0,"The Promised Day Is Come (#13)"],[1,"the dead and of manifesting the Cause of the Lord of  all Names and Attributes, and of redeeming all who are on earth, hath  closed His eyes to His own well-being and borne that which no other person  hath borne or will bear.\"    The most important of His Tablets addressed to individual sovereigns  Baha'u'llah ordered to be written in the form of a pentacle, symbolizing  the temple of man, including therein, as a conclusion, the following words  which reveal the importance He attached to those Messages, and indicate  their direct association with the prophecy of the Old Testament: \"Thus  have We built the Temple with the hands of power and might, could ye but  know it. This is the Temple promised unto you in the Book. Draw ye nigh  unto it. This is that which profiteth you, could ye but comprehend it. Be  fair, O peoples of the earth! Which is preferable, this, or a temple which  is built of clay? Set your faces towards it. Thus have ye been commanded  by God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Follow ye His bidding, and  praise ye God, your Lord, for that which He hath bestowed upon you. He,  verily, is the Truth. No God is there but He. He revealeth what He  pleaseth, through His words 'Be and it is.'\"    Referring to this same subject, He, in one of His Tablets, thus addresses  the followers of Jesus Christ: \"O concourse of the followers of the Son!  Verily, the Temple hath been built with the hands of the will of your  Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bounteous. Bear, then, witness, O people, unto  that which I say: Which is preferable, that which is built of clay, or  that which is built by the hands of your Lord, the Revealer of verses?  This is the Temple promised unto you in the Tablets. It calleth aloud: 'O  followers of religions! Haste ye to attain unto Him Who is the Source of  all causes, and follow not every infidel and doubter.'\"    It should not be forgotten that, apart from these specific Tablets in  which the kings of the earth are severally and collectively addressed,  Baha'u'llah has revealed other Tablets--the Lawh-i-Ra'is being an  outstanding example--and interspersed the mass of His voluminous writings  with unnumbered passages, in which direct addresses, as well as  references, have been made to ministers, governments, and their accredited  representatives. I am not concerned, however, with such addresses and  references, which, vital as they are, cannot be regarded as being endowed  with that peculiar pregnancy which direct and specific messages, voiced by  the Manifestation of God and directed to the world's Chief Magistrates in  His day, must possess.    Dear friends! Enough has been said to portray the tribulations which, for  so long a time, overwhelmed the Founders of so preeminent a Revelation,  and which the world has so disastrously ignored. Sufficient attention has  also been directed to the Messages addressed to those sovereign rulers  who, either in the exercise of their unconditioned authority, have  deliberately provoked these sufferings, or could have, in the plenitude of  their power, arisen to mitigate their effect or deflect their tragic  course. Let us now consider the consequences that have ensued. The  reaction of these monarchs was, as already stated, varied and unmistakable  and, as the march of events has gradually unfolded, disastrous in its  consequences. One of the most outstanding amongst these sovereigns treated  the Divine Summons with gross disrespect, dismissing it with a curt and  insolent reply, written by one of his ministers. Another laid violent hold  on the bearer of the Message, tortured, branded, and brutally slew him.  Others preferred to maintain a contemptuous silence. All failed completely  in their duty to arise and extend their assistance. Two of them, in  particular, prompted by the dual impulse of fear and anger, tightened  their grip on the Cause they had jointly resolved to uproot. The one  condemned his Divine Prisoner to yet another banishment, to \"the most  unsightly of cities in appearance, the most detestable in climate, and the  foulest in water,\" whilst the other, powerless to lay hands on the Prime  Mover of a hated Faith, subjected its adherents under his sway to abject  and savage cruelties. The recital of Baha'u'llah's sufferings, embodied in  those Messages, failed to evoke compassion in their hearts. His appeals,  the like of which neither the annals of Christianity nor even those of  Islam have recorded, were disdainfully rejected. The dark warnings He  uttered were haughtily scorned. The bold challenges He issued were  ignored. The chastisements He predicted they derisively brushed aside.    What, then--might we not consider--has, in the face of so complete and  ignominious a rejection, happened, and is still happening, in the course,  and particularly in the closing years, of this, the first Baha'i century,  a century fraught with such tumultuous sufferings and violent outrages for  the persecuted Faith of Baha'u'llah? Empires fallen in dust, kingdoms  subverted, dynasties extinguished, royalty besmirched, kings assassinated,  poisoned, driven into exile, subjugated in their own realms, whilst the  few remaining thrones are trembling with the repercussions of the fall of  their fellows.    This process, so gigantic, so catastrophic, may be said to have had its  inception on that memorable night when, in an obscure corner of _Sh_iraz,  the Bab, in the presence of the First Letter to believe in Him, revealed  the first chapter of His celebrated commentary on the Surih of Joseph (The  Qayyum-i-Asma), in which He trumpeted His Call to the sovereigns and  princes of the earth. It passed from incubation to visible manifestation  when Baha'u'llah's prophecies, enshrined for all time in the  Suriy-i-Haykal, and uttered before Napoleon III's dramatic downfall and  the self-imposed imprisonment of Pope Pius IX in the Vatican, were  fulfilled. It gathered momentum when, in the days of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the  Great War extinguished the Romanov, the Hohenzollern, and Hapsburg  dynasties, and converted powerful time-honored monarchies into republics.  It was further accelerated, soon after 'Abdu'l-Baha's passing, by the  demise of the effete Qajar dynasty in Persia, and the stupendous collapse  of both the Sultanate and the Caliphate. It is still operating, under our  very eyes, as we behold the fate which, in the course of this colossal and  ravaging struggle, is successively overtaking the crowned heads of the  European continent. Surely, no man, contemplating dispassionately the  manifestations of this relentless revolutionizing process, within  comparatively so short a time, can escape the conclusion that the last  hundred years may well be regarded, in so far as the fortunes of royalty  are concerned, as one of the most cataclysmic periods in the annals of  mankind.            HUMILIATION IMMEDIATE AND COMPLETE      Of all the monarchs of the earth, at the time when Baha'u'llah,  proclaiming His Message to them, revealed the Suriy-i-Muluk in Adrianople,  the most august and influential were the French Emperor and the Supreme  Pontiff. In the political and religious spheres they respectively held the  foremost rank, and the humiliation both suffered was alike immediate and  complete.    Napoleon III, son of Louis Bonaparte (brother of Napoleon I), was, few  historians will deny, the most outstanding monarch of his day in the West.  \"The Emperor,\" it was said of him, \"was the state.\" The French capital was  the most attractive capital in Europe, the French court \"the most  brilliant and luxurious of the XIX century.\" Possessed of a fixed and  indestructible ambition, he aspired to emulate the example, and finish the  interrupted work, of his imperial uncle. A dreamer, a conspirator, of a  shifting nature, hypocritical and reckless, he, the heir to the Napoleonic  throne, taking advantage of the policy which sought to foster the reviving  interest in the career of his great prototype, had sought to overthrow the  monarchy. Failing in his attempt, he was deported to America, was later  captured in the course of an attempted invasion of France, was condemned  to perpetual captivity, and escaped to London, until, in 1848, the  Revolution brought about his return, and enabled him to overthrow the  constitution, after which he was proclaimed emperor. Though able to  initiate far-reaching movements, he possessed neither the sagacity nor the  courage required to control them.    To this man, the last emperor of the French, who, through foreign  conquest, had striven to endear his dynasty to the people, who even  cherished the ideal of making France the center of a revived Roman  Empire--to such a man the Exile of Akka, already thrice banished by Sultan  'Abdu'l-'Aziz, had transmitted, from behind the walls of the barracks in  which He lay imprisoned, an Epistle which bore this indubitably clear  arraignment and ominous prophecy: \"We testify that that which wakened thee  was not their cry [Turks drowned in the Black Sea], but the promptings of  thine own passions, for We tested thee, and found thee wanting.... Hadst  thou been sincere in thy words, thou wouldst not have cast behind thy back  the Book of God [previous Tablet], when it was sent unto thee by Him Who  is the Almighty, the All-Wise. ...For what thou hast done, thy kingdom  shall be thrown into confusion, and thine empire shall pass from thine  hands, as a punishment for that which thou hast wrought.\"    Baha'u'llah's previous Message, forwarded through one of the French  ministers to the Emperor, had been accorded a welcome the nature of which  can be conjectured from the words recorded in the \"Epistle to the Son of  the Wolf\": \"To this [first Tablet], however, he did not reply. After Our  arrival in the Most Great Prison there reached Us a letter from his  minister, the first part of which was in Persian, and the latter in his  own handwriting. In it he was cordial, and wrote"]]]
