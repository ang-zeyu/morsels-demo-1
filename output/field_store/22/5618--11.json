Another resemblance to the Sinhalese story is the  evangelization of lower Burma by Asoka's missionaries. The Dipavamsa  states[132] that Sona and Uttara were despatched to Suvarnabhumi.  This is identified with Ramannadesa or the district of Thaton, which  appears to be a corruption of Saddhammapura[133] and the tradition is  accepted in Burma. The scepticism with which modern scholars have  received it is perhaps unmerited, but the preaching of these  missionaries, if it ever took place, cannot at present be connected  with other historical events. Nevertheless the statement of the  Dipavamsa is significant. The work was composed in the fourth  century A.D. and taken from older chronicles. It may therefore be  concluded that in the early centuries of our era lower Burma had  the reputation of being a Buddhist country.[134] It also appears  certain that in the eleventh century, when the Talaings were conquered  by Anawrata, Buddhist monks and copies of the Tipitaka were found  there. But we know little about the country in the preceding  centuries. The Kalyani inscription says that before Anawrata's  conquest it was divided and decadent and during this period there is  no proof of intercourse with Ceylon but also no disproof. One result  of Anawrata's conquest of Thaton was that he exchanged religious  embassies with the king of Ceylon, and it is natural to suppose that  the two monarchs were moved to this step by traditions of previous  communications. Intercourse with the east coast of India may be  assumed as natural, and is confirmed by the presence of Sanskrit words  in old Talaing and the information about southern India in Talaing  records, in which the city of Conjevaram, the great commentator  Dharmapala and other men of learning are often mentioned. Analogies  have also been traced between the architecture of Pagan and southern  India.[135] It will be seen that such communication by sea may have  brought not only Hinayanist Buddhism but also Mahayanist and Tantric  Buddhism as well as Brahmanism from Bengal and Orissa, so that it is  not surprising if all these influences can be detected in the ancient  buildings and sculptures of the country.[136] Still the most important  evidence as to the character of early Burmese Buddhism is Hinayanist  and furnished by inscriptions on thin golden plates and tiles, found  near the ancient site of Prome and deciphered by Finot.[137] They  consist of Hinayanist religious formulae: the language is Pali: the  alphabet is of a south Indian type and is said to resemble closely  that used in the inscriptions of the Kadamba dynasty which ruled in  Kanara from the third to the sixth century. It is to the latter  part of this period that the inscriptions are to be attributed. They  show that a form of the Hinayana, comparable, so far as the brief  documents permit us to judge, with the church of Ceylon, was then  known in lower Burma and was probably the state church. The character  of the writing, taken together with the knowledge of southern India  shown by the Talaing chronicles and the opinion of the Dipavamsa that  Burma was a Buddhist country, is good evidence that lower Burma had  accepted Hinayanism before the sixth century and had intercourse with  southern India. More than that it would perhaps be rash to say.    The Burmese tradition that Buddhaghosa was a native of Thaton and  returned thither from Ceylon merits more attention than it has  received. It can be easily explained away as patriotic fancy. On the  other hand, if Buddhaghosa's object was to invigorate Hinayanism in  India, the result of his really stupendous labours was singularly  small, for in India his name is connected with no religious movement.  But if we suppose that he went to Ceylon by way of the holy places in  Magadha and returned from the Coromandel Coast to Burma where  Hinayanism afterwards nourished, we have at least a coherent  narrative.[138]    It is noticeable that Taranatha states[139] that in the Koki  countries, among which he expressly mentions Pukham (Pagan) and  Hamsavati (Pegu), Hinayanism was preached from the days of Asoka  onwards, but that the Mahayana was not known until the pupils of  Vasubandhu introduced it.    The presence of Hinayanism in Lower Burma naturally did not prevent  the arrival of Mahayanism. It has not left many certain traces but  Atisa (_c._ 1000), a great figure in the history of Tibetan  Buddhism, is reported to have studied both in Magadha and in  Suvarnadvipa by which Thaton must be meant. He would hardly have done  this, had the clergy of Thaton been unfriendly to Tantric learning.  This mediaeval Buddhism was also, as in other countries, mixed with  Hinduism but whereas in Camboja and Champa Sivaism, especially  the worship of the lingam, was long the official and popular cult and  penetrated to Siam, few Sivaite emblems but numerous statues of  Vishnuite deities have hitherto been discovered in Burma.    The above refers chiefly to Lower Burma. The history of Burmese  Buddhism becomes clearer in the eleventh century but before passing to  this new period we must enquire what was the religious condition of  Upper Burma in the centuries preceding it. It is clear that any  variety of Buddhism or Brahmanism may have entered this region from  India by land at any epoch. According to both Hsuan Chuang and I-Ching  Buddhism flourished in Samatata and the latter mentions images of  Avalokita and the reading of the Prajna-paramita. The precise position  of Samatata has not been fixed but in any case it was in the east  of Bengal and not far from the modern Burmese frontier. The existence  of early Sanskrit inscriptions at Taungu and elsewhere has been  recorded but not with as much detail as could be wished.[140] Figures  of Bodhisattvas and Indian deities are reported from Prome,[141] and  in the Lower Chindwin district are rock-cut temples resembling the  caves of Barabar in Bengal. Inscriptions also show that at Prome there  were kings, perhaps in the seventh century, who used the Pyu language  but bore Sanskrit titles. According to Burmese tradition the Buddha  himself visited the site of Pagan and prophesied that a king called  Sammutiraya would found a city there and establish the faith. This  prediction is said to have been fulfilled in 108 A.D. but the notices  quoted from the Burmese chronicles are concerned less with the  progress of true religion than with the prevalence of heretics known  as Aris.[142] It has been conjectured that this name is a corruption  of Arya but it appears that the correct orthography is _aran_  representing an original _aranyaka_, that is forest priests. It is  hard to say whether they were degraded Buddhists or an indigenous  priesthood who in some ways imitated what they knew of Brahmanic  and Buddhist institutions. They wore black robes, let their hair grow,  worshipped serpents, hung up in their temples the heads of animals  that had been sacrificed, and once a year they assisted the king to  immolate a victim to the Nats on a mountain top. They claimed power to  expiate all sins, even parricide. They lived in convents (which is  their only real resemblance to Buddhist monks) but were not  celibate.[143] Anawrata is said to have suppressed the Aris but he  certainly did not extirpate them for an inscription dated 1468 records  their existence in the Myingyan district. Also in a village near Pagan  are preserved Tantric frescoes representing Bodhisattvas with their  Saktis. In one temple is an inscription dated 1248 and requiring  the people to supply the priests morning and evening with rice, beef,  betel, and a jar of spirits.[144] It is not clear whether these  priests were Aris or not, but they evidently professed an extreme form  of Buddhist Saktism.    Chinese influences in Upper Burma must also be taken into account.  Burmese kings were perhaps among the many potentates who sent  religious embassies to the Emperor Wu-ti about 525 A.D. and the  T'ang[145] annals show an acquaintance with Burma. They describe the  inhabitants as devout Buddhists, reluctant to take life or even to  wear silk, since its manufacture involves the death of the silk worms.  There were a hundred monasteries into which the youth entered at the  age of seven, leaving at the age of twenty, if they did not intend to  become monks. The Chinese writer does not seem to have regarded the  religion of Burma as differing materially from Buddhism as he knew it  and some similarities in ecclesiastical terminology shown by Chinese  and Burmese may indicate the presence of Chinese influence.[146]  But this influence, though possibly strong between the sixth and tenth  centuries A.D., and again about the time of the Chinese invasion of  1284,[147] cannot be held to exclude Indian influence.    Thus when Anawrata came to the throne[148] several forms of religion  probably co-existed at Pagan, and probably most of them were corrupt,  though it is a mistake to think of his dominions as barbarous. The  reformation which followed is described by Burmese authors in  considerable detail and as usual in such accounts is ascribed to the  activity of one personality, the Thera Arahanta who came from Thaton  and enjoyed Anawrata's confidence. The story implies that there was a  party in Pagan which knew that the prevalent creed was corrupt and  also looked upon Thaton and Ceylon as religious centres. As Anawrata  was a man of arms rather than a theologian, we may conjecture that his  motive was to concentrate in his capital the flower of learning as  known in his time--a motive which has often animated successful  princes in Asia and led to the unceremonious seizure of living saints.  According to the story he broke up the communities of Aris at the  instigation of Arahanta and then sent a mission to Manohari, king of  Pegu, asking for a copy of the Tipitaka and for relics.

It is of  much too grave a nature to speak of it, so long as it continues to be  only a hypothesis.\"    \"Have you, at least, some idea as to who the murderer is?\"    \"No, monsieur, I don't know who the murderer is; but don't be afraid,  Monsieur Robert Darzac--I shall know.\"    I could not but observe that Monsieur Darzac was deeply moved; and I  suspected that Rouletabille's confident assertion was not pleasing to  him. Why, I asked myself, if he was really afraid that the murderer  should be discovered, was he helping the reporter to find him? My  young friend seemed to have received the same impression, for he said,  bluntly:    \"Monsieur Darzac, don't you want me to find out who the murderer was?\"    \"Oh!--I should like to kill him with my own hand!\" cried Mademoiselle  Stangerson's fiance, with a vehemence that amazed me.    \"I believe you,\" said Rouletabille gravely; \"but you have not answered  my question.\"    We were passing by the thicket, of which the young reporter had spoken  to us a minute before. I entered it and pointed out evident traces of a  man who had been hidden there. Rouletabille, once more, was right.    \"Yes, yes!\" he said. \"We have to do with a thing of flesh and blood, who  uses the same means that we do. It'll all come out on those lines.\"    Having said this, he asked me for the paper pattern of the footprint  which he had given me to take care of, and applied it to a very clear  footmark behind the thicket. \"Aha!\" he said, rising.    I thought he was now going to trace back the track of the murderer's  footmarks to the vestibule window; but he led us instead, far to the  left, saying that it was useless ferreting in the mud, and that he was  sure, now, of the road taken by the murderer.    \"He went along the wall to the hedge and dry ditch, over which he  jumped. See, just in front of the little path leading to the lake, that  was his nearest way to get out.\"    \"How do you know he went to the lake?\"--    \"Because Frederic Larsan has not quitted the borders of it since this  morning. There must be some important marks there.\"    A few minutes later we reached the lake.    It was a little sheet of marshy water, surrounded by reeds, on which  floated some dead water-lily leaves. The great Fred may have seen us  approaching, but we probably interested him very little, for he took  hardly any notice of us and continued to be stirring with his cane  something which we could not see.    \"Look!\" said Rouletabille, \"here again are the footmarks of the escaping  man; they skirt the lake here and finally disappear just before this  path, which leads to the high road to Epinay. The man continued his  flight to Paris.\"    \"What makes you think that?\" I asked, \"since these footmarks are not  continued on the path?\"    \"What makes me think that?--Why these footprints, which I expected to  find!\" he cried, pointing to the sharply outlined imprint of a neat  boot. \"See!\"--and he called to Frederic Larsan.    \"Monsieur Fred, these neat footprints seem to have been made since the  discovery of the crime.\"    \"Yes, young man, yes, they have been carefully made,\" replied Fred  without raising his head. \"You see, there are steps that come, and steps  that go back.\"    \"And the man had a bicycle!\" cried the reporter.    Here, after looking at the marks of the bicycle, which followed, going  and coming, the neat footprints, I thought I might intervene.    \"The bicycle explains the disappearance of the murderer's big  foot-prints,\" I said. \"The murderer, with his rough boots, mounted a  bicycle. His accomplice, the wearer of the neat boots, had come to wait  for him on the edge of the lake with the bicycle. It might be supposed  that the murderer was working for the other.\"    \"No, no!\" replied Rouletabille with a strange smile. \"I have expected  to find these footmarks from the very beginning. These are not the  footmarks of the murderer!\"    \"Then there were two?\"    \"No--there was but one, and he had no accomplice.\"    \"Very good!--Very good!\" cried Frederic Larsan.    \"Look!\" continued the young reporter, showing us the ground where it had  been disturbed by big and heavy heels; \"the man seated himself there,  and took off his hobnailed boots, which he had worn only for the purpose  of misleading detection, and then no doubt, taking them away with him,  he stood up in his own boots, and quietly and slowly regained the high  road, holding his bicycle in his hand, for he could not venture to ride  it on this rough path. That accounts for the lightness of the impression  made by the wheels along it, in spite of the softness of the ground. If  there had been a man on the bicycle, the wheels would have sunk deeply  into the soil. No, no; there was but one man there, the murderer on  foot.\"    \"Bravo!--bravo!\" cried Fred again, and coming suddenly towards us and,  planting himself in front of Monsieur Robert Darzac, he said to him:    \"If we had a bicycle here, we might demonstrate the correctness of the  young man's reasoning, Monsieur Robert Darzac. Do you know whether there  is one at the chateau?\"    \"No!\" replied Monsieur Darzac. \"There is not. I took mine, four days  ago, to Paris, the last time I came to the chateau before the crime.\"    \"That's a pity!\" replied Fred, very coldly. Then, turning to  Rouletabille, he said: \"If we go on at this rate, we'll both come to the  same conclusion. Have you any idea, as to how the murderer got away from  The Yellow Room?\"    \"Yes,\" said my young friend; \"I have an idea.\"    \"So have I,\" said Fred, \"and it must be the same as yours. There are no  two ways of reasoning in this affair. I am waiting for the arrival of my  chief before offering any explanation to the examining magistrate.\"    \"Ah! Is the Chief of the Surete coming?\"    \"Yes, this afternoon. He is going to summon, before the magistrate, in  the laboratory, all those who have played any part in this tragedy. It  will be very interesting. It is a pity you won't be able to be present.\"    \"I shall be present,\" said Rouletabille confidently.    \"Really--you are an extraordinary fellow--for your age!\" replied the  detective in a tone not wholly free from irony. \"You'd make a wonderful  detective--if you had a little more method--if you didn't follow your  instincts and that bump on your forehead. As I have already several  times observed, Monsieur Rouletabille, you reason too much; you do not  allow yourself to be guided by what you have seen. What do you say to  the handkerchief full of blood, and the red mark of the hand on the  wall? You have seen the stain on the wall, but I have only seen the  handkerchief.\"    \"Bah!\" cried Rouletabille, \"the murderer was wounded in the hand by  Mademoiselle Stangerson's revolver!\"    \"Ah!--a simply instinctive observation! Take care!--You are becoming too  strictly logical, Monsieur Rouletabille; logic will upset you if you  use it indiscriminately. You are right, when you say that Mademoiselle  Stangerson fired her revolver, but you are wrong when you say that she  wounded the murderer in the hand.\"    \"I am sure of it,\" cried Rouletabille.    Fred, imperturbable, interrupted him:    \"Defective observation--defective observation!--the examination of the  handkerchief, the numberless little round scarlet stains, the impression  of drops which I found in the tracks of the footprints, at the moment  when they were made on the floor, prove to me that the murderer was not  wounded at all. Monsieur Rouletabille, the murderer bled at the nose!\"    The great Fred spoke quite seriously. However, I could not refrain from  uttering an exclamation.    The reporter looked gravely at Fred, who looked gravely at him. And Fred  immediately concluded:    \"The man allowed the blood to flow into his hand and handkerchief, and  dried his hand on the wall. The fact is highly important,\" he added,  \"because there is no need of his being wounded in the hand for him to be  the murderer.\"    Rouletabille seemed to be thinking deeply. After a moment he said:    \"There is something--a something, Monsieur Frederic Larsan, much graver  than the misuse of logic the disposition of mind in some detectives  which makes them, in perfect good faith, twist logic to the necessities  of their preconceived ideas. You, already, have your idea about the  murderer, Monsieur Fred. Don't deny it; and your theory demands that the  murderer should not have been wounded in the hand, otherwise it comes  to nothing. And you have searched, and have found something else. It's  dangerous, very dangerous, Monsieur Fred, to go from a preconceived idea  to find the proofs to fit it. That method may lead you far astray Beware  of judicial error, Monsieur Fred, it will trip you up!\"    And laughing a little, in a slightly bantering tone, his hands in his  pockets, Rouletabille fixed his cunning eyes on the great Fred.    Frederic Larsan silently contemplated the young reporter who pretended  to be as wise as himself. Shrugging his shoulders, he bowed to us and  moved quickly away, hitting the stones on his path with his stout cane.    Rouletabille watched his retreat, and then turned toward us, his face  joyous and triumphant.    \"I shall beat him!\" he cried. \"I shall beat the great Fred, clever as he  is; I shall beat them all!\"    And he danced a double shuffle. Suddenly he stopped. My eyes followed  his"]]]
