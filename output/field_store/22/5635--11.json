Eram, como  indica a etymologia da palavra _amphitheatro_, dous theatros collocados  em frente um do outro, e separados por um espaço livre de forma oval  destinado para os combates dos gladiadores e animaes ferozes.    A este espaço davam o nome de arena _arena_, por causa da areia que  espalhavam pelo chão, afim de fazer desapparecer o sangue dos homens e  dos animaes derramado durante a luta.    [Figura 60: Plano de um amphitheatro]    Os palanques eram dispostos á roda da _arena_, de maneira que de todos  os lados os espectadores podessem gosar o espectaculo. Nos  amphitheatros, como nos theatros, esses logares eram divididos  horisontalmente por cintas curvas ou _baltei_; e verticalmente pelas  escadas em subdivisões cuneiformes, como explicamos acima. Os degraus  apoiavam-se nas abobadas, que iam estreitando para o lado da _arena_,  alargando-se e elevando-se á medida que se aproximavam do portico ou  galeria, contornando o edificio. Estas abobadas, inclinadas para o  centro e alargando para o exterior, eram sobrepostas umas ás outras, e  formavam muitas ordens, onde havia muitas cintas curvas.    [Figura 61]    A vista do corte de um grande amphitheatro mostra claramente esta  disposição, com as cintas e o effeito produzido no meio dos palanques  pelos _vomitorios da cavea_. Outro corte apresenta parte do amphitheatro  de Aries, mostrando como as grandes escadas, partindo das galerias,  conduziam ao interior da _cavea_.    [Figura 62: Corte do amphitheatro de Aries]    Na _arena_ havia combates de gladiadores,[19] de homens e animaes, e só  de animaes.    Nos dias de combate eram os gladiadores conduzidos processionalmente em  volta da _arena_; depois punham-n'os aos pares, juntando os de força  egual. O signal do combate era dado por uma banda de trombetas.    [Figura 63: Fachada exterior do amphitheatro de Arles (França)]    Havia diversas classes de gladiadores, conforme as armas que empregavam  no ataque e na defeza.    O amphitheatro de Arles, ruina das mais pittorescas que existem n'este  genero em França, tinha de comprimento do grande eixo 420 pés de Norte  ao Sul; e do pequeno eixo 309 de Leste a Oeste. A arena tinha no grande  diametro 209 pés, e no pequeno diametro 119: gravura da pag. 71 [fig.  63].    [Figura 64: Uma das principaes entradas do amphitheatro de Bordeos]    Uma cousa particular, que não existe nos outros amphitheatros, é que as  galerias subterraneas giravam por baixo e á roda do _podium_.    O _podium_ estava a 14 pés acima do solo da arena. A parede do sucalco  que o levantava a esta altura, era furada na parte inferior, com oito  passagens, conduzindo das galerias subterraneas para a arena, passagens  que saiam da galeria exterior.    [Figura 65: Plano do amphitheatro de Chenevières (Loiret)]    O amphitheatro era construido com boa cantaria de grande apparelho,  posta sem cimento algum, e era tal a grandeza das pedras que, apesar de  tantos seculos decorridos, ainda se conservam solidas nos seus leitos.    O plano da gravura da pag. 73 [fig. 64] mostra a disposição de outro  amphitheatro, que pelo seu genero custava muito menos a construir, que  outros compostos de dois lados, porque sendo marcada a inclinação para a  encosta, bastava edificar o _podium_ do lado aberto. Podia-se também  facilmente transformar os amphitheatros em theatros com outras  disposições para o scenario e então constituíam monumentos mixtos, que  foram numerosos durante a dominação romana.      *Banhos publicos*    Os romanos tinham muitas especies d'estes estabelecimentos, que se  conheciam com os nomes de _thermæ_, _lavacra_ e _balnea_.    As _thermas_[20] eram vastos edificios que continham não só os banhos,  mas tambem porticos e passeios arborisados, salas onde os philosophos e  os rhetoricos davam lições publicas e liam as suas obras; onde se  exercitavam na luta: chamavam-lhes _gymnasios_.    Citavam, entre as mais sumptuosas de Roma, as de Agrippa, Nero, Tito,  Caracalla,[21] Antonino e Diocleciano, das quaes existiam ainda  consideraveis vestigios.    Não se deve suppôr comtudo que haveria similhantes estabelecimentos em  todas as cidades onde os romanos dominaram. O mais geral era construir  _lavacra_ ou _balnea_, de limitada dimensão, á qual estavam ás vezes  reunidas algumas dependencias dos _gymnasios_.    Taes edificios eram mais ou menos espaçosos conforme deviam ser francos  ao publico de uma cidade bastante povoada, ou simplesmente destinados  ao uso de pequena localidade, ou de uma unica familia.    O _apodyterium_ era a sala de vestir, ou em que ficavam depositados os  fatos antes do banho.    O _aquarium_ continha os reservatorios, nos quaes a agua era recebida e  podia clarificar-se antes de distribuida no edificio.    O _vasarium_, tirava este nome de tres grandes vasos, ou depositos  cheios de agua quente, de agua tepida e de agua fria.    O _laconicum_, estufa aquecida por um _hypocausto_, tinha ás vezes uma  das extremidades em semicirculo, onde havia um _disco de bronze_, pelo  movimento do qual, abaixando-se ou levantando-se, podia augmentar-se a  intensidade do calor, ou diminuir a temperatura.    O _tepidarium_ era, segundo Vitruvio, a estufa menos quente que a  antecedente, e em contacto com ella.    Havia outra casa destinada para o banho de agua quente, que se tomava  n'uma especie de tina, _labra_.    O pequeno pateo ou vestibulo que precedia o forno do hypocausto  chamava-se o _propnigeum_ ou o _proefurnium_.    A parte destinada ao banho frio era o _frigidarium_, ou sala não  aquecida, onde os banhistas descançavam alguns instantes antes de sairem  para a rua, afim de evitarem o perigo da mudança rapida da temperatura.    A _piscina natatilis_ ou _frigida lavatio_, reservatorio de agua fria em  que as pessoas robustas podiam banhar-se depois do banho quente, e de  que se fazia uso principalmente no verão.    O _eleothesium_, onde os banhistas podiam esfregar o corpo com oleo ou  perfumes[22].    Uma curiosa pintura a fresco, copiada das thermas de Tito, em Roma, e  que representava o interior de uma casa de banhos, faz comprehender  muito bem a disposição geral de taes estabelecimentos, como se vê na  gravura da pag. 76 [fig. 66].    Distinguem-se, no primeiro plano, duas salas sob as quaes arde o fogo do  hypocausto.    [Figura 66: Vista de uma pintura a fresco tirada dos banhos de Tito.]    Uma d'estas salas devia ser a _concamerata sudatio_, ou a estufa  abobadada para fazer transpiração.    Ha n'esta sala um pequeno forno, cuja abobada fecha em escudo de bronze  que se movia por meio de corrente, afim de deixar sair mais ou menos o  vapor da agua quente.    Junto do _laconicum_ está a sala do banho, separada por um corredor.  Vêem-se muitas pessoas n'uma grande tina _labrum_, em volta da qual  estão assentos encostados á parede.    Mais afastado apparece representado o _vasarium_, com os tres grandes  vasos collocados em diversos niveis: o primeiro menos elevado contem  agua a ferver; o segundo agua tepida, e o terceiro agua fria.    No segundo plano, e por detraz da estufa para suar, vê-se a sala chamada  _tepidarium_.    Passado o _tepidarium_, distingue-se a sala fria, _frigidarium_, que em  alguns banhos servia tambem ao _apoditerium_. Em ultimo plano está o  _eleothesium_, ou sala dos perfumes.    Para se formar idéa exacta d'estes monumentos, convem examinar e  comparar entre elles que se têem descoberto em differentes partes; para  o que apresentamos as gravuras dos banhos de Verdes e de Landunum.      *Explicações crestas casas de banhos*    Entrava-se por dois pateos sobre o comprido ou corredores G, K, nos  banhos de Verdes, para os salões P, S, os quaes tem ainda no chão  mosaicos. D'estes dois salões passava-se para o vestibulo B, e d'ahi  para a sala D, cujo piso estava sobre hypocausto.    A sala imediata C, devia ser de temperatura mais elevada á antecedente;  pois o forno collocado em F, no pequeno pateo proximo, recebia d'elle o  calor que circulava primeiro debaixo do piso da referida sala C.    Havia outras casas que não eram aquecidas pelo hypocausto, especie de  saletas pelas quaes se entrava e saía P, A, B, S.    [Figura 67: Banhos de Verdes (França), vistos de alto.]    [Figura 68: Plano dos banhos de Landunum (França).]    Duas bandeiras muito notáveis que serviriam para banhos frios ML,  tinham communicação por uma passagem com a sala D; cada uma d'ellas  tinha em S e em R um reservatorio para agua.    Os pateos H e I serviam de deposito para o combustivel.    Em cada uma das salas O e P havia um nicho para uma estatua.    Nos banhos de Laudunum (pag. 79 [fig. 68]), no vestibulo D, o chão tinha  mosaicos. D'aqui passava-se á bella sala (n.^o 8), tambem com mosaico.  Seguiam-se outras casas com o solo suspenso e aquecido pelo hypocausto;  em uma (n.^o 7) de um lado tem um nicho circular, e do outro, quadrado  _d c_, que serviam para as banheiras.    A sala n.^o 6 seria a reservada para conservar maior gráo de calor,  porque o forno do hypocausto tinha a boca d'elle no centro d'esta casa.    O forno tinha serventia pelo pequeno pateo n.^o 4. Antes de atravessar a  sala n.^o 6 aquecia tres reservatorios revestidos de cimento _f. f._    As salas E, e os n.^{os} 9, 10, 11 eram casas para depositos do  estabelecimento.      *Palacios*    Quasi todas as cidades de pequena importancia tinham palacio destinado  para os aposentos dos imperadores, quando as visitavam; porem antes  serviam para os seus representantes, os intendentes ou funccionarios  encarregados da administração do paiz.    Os palacios que deviam offerecer as disposições analogas ás das casas  nobres dos particulares, differençavam-se principalmente pela extensão,  pelos peristylos, pateos e diversas dependencias. Os de maiores  dimensões, como o de Trajano, eram ligados ao _forum_, junto do qual  havia basilica,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17188"],[0,"Buccaneers and Pirates of Our Coasts (#13)"],[1,"their methods of operation and boldly  planned to seize the treasures of their enemy before it was put upon the  ships.    Consequently, the buccaneers formed themselves into larger bodies  commanded by noted leaders, and made attacks upon the Spanish  settlements and towns. Many of these were found nearly defenceless, and  even those which boasted fortifications often fell before the reckless  charges of the buccaneers. The pillage, the burning, and the cruelty on  shore exceeded that which had hitherto been known on the sea. There is  generally a great deal more in a town than there is in a ship, and the  buccaneers proved themselves to be among the most outrageous, exacting,  and cruel conquerors ever known in the world. They were governed by no  laws of warfare; whatever they chose to do they did. They respected  nobody, not even themselves, and acted like wild beasts, without the  disposition which is generally shown by a wild beast, to lie down and go  to sleep when he has had enough.    There were times when it seemed as though it would be safer for a man  who had a regard for his life and comfort, to sail upon a pirate ship  instead of a Spanish galleon, or to take up his residence in one of the  uncivilized communities of Tortuga or Jamaica, instead of settling in a  well-ordered Spanish-American town with its mayor, its officials, and  its garrison.    It was a very strange nation of marine bandits which had thus sprung  into existence on these faraway waters; it was a nation of grown-up men,  who existed only for the purpose of carrying off that which other people  were taking away; it was a nation of second-hand robbers, who carried  their operations to such an extent that they threatened to do away  entirely with that series of primary robberies to which Spain had  devoted herself. I do not know that there were any companies formed in  those days for the prosecution of buccaneering, but I am quite sure that  if there had been, their shares would have gone up to a very high  figure.          Chapter XII    The Story of L'Olonnois the Cruel      In the preceding chapter we have seen that the buccaneers had at last  become so numerous and so formidable that it was dangerous for a Spanish  ship laden with treasure from the new world to attempt to get out of the  Caribbean Sea into the Atlantic, and that thus failing to find enough  richly laden vessels to satisfy their ardent cravings for plunder, the  buccaneers were forced to make some change in their methods of criminal  warfare; and from capturing Spanish galleons, they formed themselves  into well-organized bodies and attacked towns.    Among the buccaneer leaders who distinguished themselves as land pirates  was a thoroughbred scoundrel by the name of Francis L'Olonnois, who was  born in France. In those days it was the custom to enforce servitude  upon people who were not able to take care of themselves. Unfortunate  debtors and paupers of all classes were sold to people who had need of  their services. The only difference sometimes between master and  servant depended entirely upon the fact that one had money, and the  other had none. Boys and girls were sold for a term of years, somewhat  as if they had been apprentices, and it so happened that the boy  L'Olonnois was sold to a master who took him to the West Indies. There  he led the life of a slave until he was of age, and then, being no  longer subject to ownership, he became one of the freest and most  independent persons who ever walked this earth.    He began his career on the island of Hispaniola, where he took up the  business of hunting and butchering cattle; but he very soon gave up this  life for that of a pirate, and enlisted as a common sailor on one of  their ships. Here he gave signs of such great ability as a brave and  unscrupulous scoundrel that one of the leading pirates on the island of  Tortuga gave him a ship and a crew, and set him up in business on his  own account. The piratical career of L'Olonnois was very much like that  of other buccaneers of the day, except that he was so abominably cruel  to the Spanish prisoners whom he captured that he gained a reputation  for vile humanity, surpassing that of any other rascal on the western  continent. When he captured a prisoner, it seemed to delight his soul as  much to torture and mutilate him before killing him as to take away  whatever valuables he possessed. His reputation for ingenious  wickedness spread all over the West Indies, so that the crews of Spanish  ships, attacked by this demon, would rather die on their decks or sink  to the bottom in their ships than be captured by L'Olonnois.    All the barbarities, the brutalities, and the fiendish ferocity which  have ever been attributed to the pirates of the world were united in the  character of this inhuman wretch, who does not appear to be so good an  example of the true pirate as Roc, the Brazilian. He was not so brave,  he was not so able, and he was so utterly base that it would be  impossible for any one to look upon him as a hero. After having attained  in a very short time the reputation of being the most bloody and wicked  pirate of his day, L'Olonnois was unfortunate enough to be wrecked upon  the coast, not far from the town of Campeachy. He and his crew got  safely to shore, but it was not long before their presence was  discovered by the people of the town, and the Spanish soldiers thereupon  sallied out and attacked them. There was a fierce fight, but the  Spaniards were the stronger, and the buccaneers were utterly defeated.  Many of them were killed, and most of the rest wounded or taken  prisoners.    Among the wounded was L'Olonnois, and as he knew that if he should be  discovered he would meet with no mercy, he got behind some bushes,  scooped up several handfuls of sand, mixed it with his blood, and with  it rubbed his face so that it presented the pallor of a corpse. Then he  lay down among the bodies of his dead companions, and when the Spaniards  afterwards walked over the battlefield, he was looked upon as one of the  common pirates whom they had killed.    When the soldiers had retired into the town with their prisoners, the  make-believe corpse stealthily arose and made his way into the woods,  where he stayed until his wounds were well enough for him to walk about.  He divested himself of his great boots, his pistol belt, and the rest of  his piratical costume, and, adding to his scanty raiment a cloak and hat  which he had stolen from a poor cottage, he boldly approached the town  and entered it. He looked like a very ordinary person, and no notice was  taken of him by the authorities. Here he found shelter and something to  eat, and he soon began to make himself very much at home in the streets  of Campeachy.    It was a very gay time in the town, and, as everybody seemed to be  happy, L'Olonnois was very glad to join in the general rejoicing, and  these hilarities gave him particular pleasure as he found out that he  was the cause of them. The buccaneers who had been captured, and who  were imprisoned in the fortress, had been interrogated over and over  again by the Spanish officials in regard to L'Olonnois, their commander,  and, as they had invariably answered that he had been killed, the  Spanish were forced to believe the glad tidings, and they celebrated the  death of the monster as the greatest piece of public good fortune which  could come to their community. They built bonfires, they sang songs  about the death of the black-hearted buccaneer, and services of  thanksgiving were held in their churches.    All this was a great delight to L'Olonnois, who joined hands with the  young men and women, as they danced around the bonfires; he assisted in  a fine bass voice in the choruses which told of his death and his  dreadful doom, and he went to church and listened to the priests and the  people as they gave thanks for their deliverance from his enormities.    But L'Olonnois did not waste all his time chuckling over the baseless  rejoicings of the people of the town. He made himself acquainted with  some of the white slaves, men who had been brought from England, and  finding some of them very much discontented with their lot, he ventured  to tell them that he was one of the pirates who had escaped, and offered  them riches and liberty if they would join him in a scheme he had  concocted. It would have been easy enough for him to get away from the  town by himself, but this would have been of no use to him unless he  obtained some sort of a vessel, and some men to help him navigate it. So  he proposed to the slaves that they should steal a small boat belonging  to the master of one of them, and in this, under cover of the night, the  little party safely left Campeachy and set sail for Tortuga, which, as  we have told, was then the headquarters of the buccaneers, and \"the  common place of refuge of all sorts or wickedness, and the seminary, as  it were, of all manner of pirates.\"          Chapter XIII    A Resurrected Pirate      When L'Olonnois arrived at Tortuga he caused great astonishment among  his old associates; that he had come back a comparative pauper surprised  no one, for this was a common thing to happen to a pirate, but the  wonder was that he got back at all.    He had no money, but, by the exercise of his crafty abilities, he  managed to get possession of a ship, which he manned with a crew of  about a score of impecunious dare-devils who were very anxious to do  something to mend their fortunes.    Having now become very fond of land-fighting, he did not go out in  search of ships, but directed his vessel to a little village called de  los Cayos, on the coast of Cuba, for here, he thought, was a chance for  a good and easy stroke of business. This village was the abode of  industrious people, who were traders in tobacco, hides, and sugar, and  who were obliged to carry on their traffic in a rather peculiar manner."]]]
