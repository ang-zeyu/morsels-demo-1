Now what are you going to pay  us to hold our tongues?\"    \"Pay you!\" Lemon hissed. \"Why, damn you--nothing. We're not bankers.  All we've got to do is clear out and try somewhere else.\"    \"That might not be so easy as you imagine,\" Hamar interposed. \"We  would make it our business to have a scene first. Why not come to  terms? We'll not be over exorbitant--and consider the convenience of  not having to shift your quarters.\"    \"Well, of all the blooming frousts I've struck, none beats this,\"  Lemon said. \"Fancy being pipped by a couple of suckers like these.  Farmers, indeed! Why don't you call yourselves parsons? How much do  you want?\"    After a prolonged haggling, Hamar and Curtis agreed to take fifty  dollars; and, considering their penniless condition, they were by no  means dissatisfied with their bargain.    They were now ready to go, and looking round for Kelson, found him  engaged in a desperate _tete-a-tete_ with the young lady at the bar,  who, despite her avowed lack of faith in mankind, counted half the  room her friends. She promised Kelson that she would meet him at eight  o'clock that evening; but as both she and he were quite used to making  such promises and subsequently forgetting all about them, their  rencontre resulted in only one thing, namely, in furnishing the three  allies with the nucleus of the big fortune they intended making.    On finding themselves outside the dive Hamar, Curtis and Kelson first  of all divided the spoil. They then went to a clothes depot and rigged  themselves out in fashionably cut garments; after which they took  rooms at a presentable hotel in Kearney Street, next door to Knobble's  boot store. Then, dressed for the first time in their lives like Nob  Hill dukes, they paraded the pet resorts of the beau-monde--of the  bonanza and railroad set--and making eyes at all the pretty wives and  daughters they met, cogitated fresh devices for making money. As they  sauntered across Pacific Avenue, in the direction of Californian  Street, Kelson suddenly gave vent to a whistle.    \"What the deuce is wrong with you?\" Hamar exclaimed. \"Seen your  grandmother's ghost?\"    \"No! but I've seen the inner readings of that lady yonder,\" Kelson  replied, indicating with a jerk of his finger a fashionably dressed  woman walking towards them on the other side of the road. \"The deuce  knows how it all comes to me, but I know everything about her, just  the same as I did with the girl in the dive--though I've never seen  her before. She is the wife of D.D. Belton, the cotton magnate, who  lives in a big, white house at the corner of Powell Street--and a  beauty, I can assure you. Supposed to be most devoted to her husband,  she is now on her way to keep an appointment with the Rev. J.T.  Calthorpe of Sancta Maria's Church in Appleyard Street, with whom she  has been holding clandestine meetings for the past six months.\"    \"Whew!\" Hamar ejaculated. \"You speak as if it was all being pumped  into you by some external agency--automatically.\"    \"That's just about what I feel!\" Kelson said, \"I feel as if it were  some one else saying all this--some one else speaking through me. Yet  I know all about that woman, just as much as if I had been acquainted  with her all my life!\"    \"It's the first power,\" Hamar said excitedly, \"the power of  divination. It takes that form with you, and the form of card tricks  with Ed--with me nothing so far.\"    \"But what shall I do?\" Kelson cried. \"How can I benefit by it?\"    \"How can't you?\" Curtis growled. \"Why, blackmail her! If it is true,  she will pay you anything to keep your mouth shut. If once you can  tell a woman's secret, your future's made. All San Francisco will be  at your mercy--God knows who'll escape! After her at once, you idiot!\"    \"Now?\" Kelson gasped.    \"Yes! Now! Follow her to Calthorpe's and waylay her as she comes out.  You can refer to us as witnesses.\"    \"I feel a bit of a blackguard,\" Kelson pleaded.    \"You look it, anyway,\" Curtis grinned. \"But cheer up--it's the  clothes. Clothes are responsible for everything!\"    After a little persuasion Kelson gave in, but he had to make haste as  the lady was nearly out of sight. She took a taxi from the stand  opposite Kitson's hotel, and Kelson took one, too. Two hours later,  raising his hat, he accosted her as she stood tapping the pavement of  Battery Street with a daintily shod foot, waiting to cross. \"Mrs.  Belton, I think,\" he said. The lady eyed him coldly.    \"Well!\" she said, \"what do you want? Who are you?\"    \"My name can scarcely matter to you,\" Kelson responded, \"though my  business may. I have been engaged to watch you, and am fully posted as  to your meetings and correspondence with the Rev. J.T. Calthorpe.\"    \"I don't understand you,\" the lady said, her cheeks flaming. \"You have  made a mistake--a very serious mistake for you.\"    For a moment Kelson's heart failed. He was still a clerk, with all the  humility of an office stool and shining trousers' seat thick on him,  whilst she was a _grande dame_ accustomed to the bows and scrapes of  employers as well as employed.    Several people passed by and stared at him--as he thought--suspiciously,  and he felt that this was the most critical time in his life, and  unless he pulled through, smartly in fact, he would be done once and  for all. If he didn't make haste, too, the woman would undoubtedly  call a policeman. It was this thought as well as--though, perhaps,  hardly as much as--the look of her that stimulated Kelson to action.  He hated behaving badly to women; but was this thing, dressed in a  skirt that fitted like a glove and showed up every detail of her  figure--this thing with the paint on her cheeks, and eyebrows, and  lips--artistically done, perhaps, but done all the same--this thing  all loaded with jewellery and buttons--this thing--a woman! No! She  was not--she was only a millionaire's plaything--brainless,  heartless--a hobby that cost thousands, whilst countless men such as  he--starved. He detested--abominated such luxuries! And thus nerved he  retorted, borrowing some of her imperiousness--    \"Do you deny, madam, that for the past two hours you've been sitting  on the sofa of the end room of the third floor of No. 216, Market  Street, flirting with the Rev. J.T. Calthorpe, whom you call  'Mickey-moo'; that you gave him a photo you had taken at Bell's Studio  in Clay Street, specially for him; that you gave him five greenbacks  to the value of one hundred and fifty dollars, and that you've planned  a moonlight promenade with him to-morrow, when your husband will be in  Denver?\"    \"Don't talk so loud,\" the lady said in a low voice. \"Walk along with  me a little and then we shan't be noticed. I see you do know a good  deal--how, I can't imagine, unless you were hidden somewhere in the  room. Who has employed you to watch me?\"    \"That, madam, I can't say,\" Kelson truthfully responded.    \"And I can't think,\" the lady said, \"unless it is some woman enemy.  But, after all, you can't do much since you hold no proofs--your word  alone will count for nothing.\"    \"Ah, but I have strong corroborative evidence,\" Kelson retorted. \"I  have the testimony of at least two other people who know quite as much  as I do.\"    \"Adventurers like yourself,\" the lady sneered. \"My husband would  neither believe you nor your friends.\"    \"He would believe your letters, any way,\" said Kelson.    \"My letters!\" the lady laughed, \"You've no letters of mine.\"    \"No, but I know where the correspondence that has passed between you  and the Rev. J.T. Calthorpe is to be found. He has sixty-nine letters  from you all tied up in pink ribbon, locked up in the bottom drawer of  the bureau in his study at the Vicarage. Some of the letters begin  with 'Dearest, duckiest, handsomest Herby'--short for Herbert; and  others, 'Fondest, blondest, darlingest Micky-moo!' Some end with 'A  thousand and one kisses from your loving and ever devoted Francesca,'  and others with 'Love and kisses ad infinitum, ever your loving,  thirsting, adoring one, Toosie!' Nice letters from the wife of a  respectable Nob Hill magnate to a married clergyman!\"    The lady walked a trifle unsteadily, and much of her colour was gone.  \"I can't understand it,\" she panted; \"somebody has played me false.\"    \"As the Rev. J.T. Calthorpe is on his way to Sacramento, where he has  to remain till to-morrow,\" Kelson went on pitilessly, \"it will be the  easiest thing in the world to get those letters. I have merely to call  at the house and tell his wife.\"    \"And what good will that do you?\" the lady asked.    \"Revenge! I hate the rich,\" Kelson said. \"I would do anything to  injure them.\"    \"You are a Socialist?\"    \"An Anarchist! But come, you see I know all about you and that I have  you completely in my power. If once either your husband or Mrs.  Calthorpe gets hold of those letters--you and your lover would have a  very unpleasant time of it.\"    \"You're a devil!\"    \"Maybe I am--at all events I'm talking to one. But that's neither here  nor there. I want money. Give me a thousand dollars and you'll never  hear from me again.\"    \"Blackmail! I could have you arrested!\"    \"Yes, and I would tell the court the whole history of your intrigues!  That wouldn't help you,\"--and Kelson laughed.    \"Could I count on you not molesting me again if I were to pay you?\"  the lady said mockingly.    \"You could.\"    \"Do you ever speak the truth?\"    \"You needn't judge every one by your own standard of morality--the  standard set up by the millionaire's wife,\" Kelson said. \"I swear that  if you pay me a thousand dollars I will never trouble you again.\"    The lady grew thoughtful, and for some minutes neither of them spoke.  Then she suddenly jerked out: \"I think, after all, I'll accept your  proposal. Wait outside here and you shall have what you want within an  hour.\"    \"Not good enough,\" Kelson said, \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14328"],[0,"The Consolation of Philosophy (#13)"],[1,"this upon itself, and so comes to appear somewhat poor in  esteem?'    'I cannot but acknowledge that, being what it is, this union of  qualities is also right famous.'    'It follows, then, that we must admit that renown is not different from  the other three.'    'It does,' said I.    'That, then, which needs nothing outside itself, which can accomplish  all things in its own strength, which enjoys fame and compels reverence,  must not this evidently be also fully crowned with joy?'    'In sooth, I cannot conceive,' said I, 'how any sadness can find  entrance into such a state; wherefore I must needs acknowledge it full  of joy--at least, if our former conclusions are to hold.'    'Then, for the same reasons, this also is necessary--that independence,  power, renown, reverence, and sweetness of delight, are different only  in name, but in substance differ no wise one from the other.'    'It is,' said I.    'This, then, which is one, and simple by nature, human perversity  separates, and, in trying to win a part of that which has no parts,  fails to attain not only that portion (since there are no portions), but  also the whole, to which it does not dream of aspiring.'    'How so?' said I.    'He who, to escape want, seeks riches, gives himself no concern about  power; he prefers a mean and low estate, and also denies himself many  pleasures dear to nature to avoid losing the money which he has gained.  But at this rate he does not even attain to independence--a weakling  void of strength, vexed by distresses, mean and despised, and buried in  obscurity. He, again, who thirsts alone for power squanders his wealth,  despises pleasure, and thinks fame and rank alike worthless without  power. But thou seest in how many ways his state also is defective.  Sometimes it happens that he lacks necessaries, that he is gnawed by  anxieties, and, since he cannot rid himself of these inconveniences,  even ceases to have that power which was his whole end and aim. In like  manner may we cast up the reckoning in case of rank, of glory, or of  pleasure. For since each one of these severally is identical with the  rest, whosoever seeks any one of them without the others does not even  lay hold of that one which he makes his aim.'    'Well,' said I, 'what then?'    'Suppose anyone desire to obtain them together, he does indeed wish for  happiness as a whole; but will he find it in these things which, as we  have proved, are unable to bestow what they promise?'    'Nay; by no means,' said I.    'Then, happiness must certainly not be sought in these things which  severally are believed to afford some one of the blessings most to be  desired.'    'They must not, I admit. No conclusion could be more true.'    'So, then, the form and the causes of false happiness are set before  thine eyes. Now turn thy gaze to the other side; there thou wilt  straightway see the true happiness I promised.'    'Yea, indeed, 'tis plain to the blind.' said I. 'Thou didst point it out  even now in seeking to unfold the causes of the false. For, unless I am  mistaken, that is true and perfect happiness which crowns one with the  union of independence, power, reverence, renown, and joy. And to prove  to thee with how deep an insight I have listened--since all these are  the same--that which can truly bestow one of them I know to be without  doubt full and complete happiness.'    'Happy art thou, my scholar, in this thy conviction; only one thing  shouldst thou add.'    'What is that?' said I.    'Is there aught, thinkest thou, amid these mortal and perishable things  which can produce a state such as this?'    'Nay, surely not; and this thou hast so amply demonstrated that no word  more is needed.'    'Well, then, these things seem to give to mortals shadows of the true  good, or some kind of imperfect good; but the true and perfect good they  cannot bestow.'    'Even so,' said I.    'Since, then, thou hast learnt what that true happiness is, and what men  falsely call happiness, it now remains that thou shouldst learn from  what source to seek this.'    'Yes; to this I have long been eagerly looking forward.'    'Well, since, as Plato maintains in the \"Timaeus,\" we ought even in the  most trivial matters to implore the Divine protection, what thinkest  thou should we now do in order to deserve to find the seat of that  highest good?'    'We must invoke the Father of all things,' said I; 'for without this no  enterprise sets out from a right beginning.'    'Thou sayest well,' said she; and forthwith lifted up her voice and  sang:        SONG IX.[I]    INVOCATION.          Maker of earth and sky, from age to age      Who rul'st the world by reason; at whose word      Time issues from Eternity's abyss:      To all that moves the source of movement, fixed      Thyself and moveless. Thee no cause impelled      Extrinsic this proportioned frame to shape      From shapeless matter; but, deep-set within      Thy inmost being, the form of perfect good,      From envy free; and Thou didst mould the whole      To that supernal pattern. Beauteous      The world in Thee thus imaged, being Thyself          Most beautiful. So Thou the work didst fashion      In that fair likeness, bidding it put on      Perfection through the exquisite perfectness      Of every part's contrivance. Thou dost bind      The elements in balanced harmony,      So that the hot and cold, the moist and dry,      Contend not; nor the pure fire leaping up      Escape, or weight of waters whelm the earth.        Thou joinest and diffusest through the whole,      Linking accordantly its several parts,      A soul of threefold nature, moving all.      This, cleft in twain, and in two circles gathered,      Speeds in a path that on itself returns,      Encompassing mind's limits, and conforms      The heavens to her true semblance. Lesser souls      And lesser lives by a like ordinance      Thou sendest forth, each to its starry car      Affixing, and dost strew them far and wide      O'er earth and heaven. These by a law benign      Thou biddest turn again, and render back      To thee their fires. Oh, grant, almighty Father,      Grant us on reason's wing to soar aloft      To heaven's exalted height; grant us to see      The fount of good; grant us, the true light found,      To fix our steadfast eyes in vision clear      On Thee. Disperse the heavy mists of earth,      And shine in Thine own splendour. For Thou art      The true serenity and perfect rest      Of every pious soul--to see Thy face,      The end and the beginning--One the guide,      The traveller, the pathway, and the goal.    FOOTNOTES:    [I] The substance of this poem is taken from Plato's 'Timaeus,' 29-42.  See Jowett, vol. iii., pp. 448-462 (third edition).        X.      'Since now thou hast seen what is the form of the imperfect good, and  what the form of the perfect also, methinks I should next show in what  manner this perfection of felicity is built up. And here I conceive it  proper to inquire, first, whether any excellence, such as thou hast  lately defined, can exist in the nature of things, lest we be deceived  by an empty fiction of thought to which no true reality answers. But it  cannot be denied that such does exist, and is, as it were, the source of  all things good. For everything which is called imperfect is spoken of  as imperfect by reason of the privation of some perfection; so it comes  to pass that, whenever imperfection is found in any particular, there  must necessarily be a perfection in respect of that particular also. For  were there no such perfection, it is utterly inconceivable how that  so-called _im_perfection should come into existence. Nature does not  make a beginning with things mutilated and imperfect; she starts with  what is whole and perfect, and falls away later to these feeble and  inferior productions. So if there is, as we showed before, a happiness  of a frail and imperfect kind, it cannot be doubted but there is also a  happiness substantial and perfect.'    'Most true is thy conclusion, and most sure,' said I.    'Next to consider where the dwelling-place of this happiness may be. The  common belief of all mankind agrees that God, the supreme of all things,  is good. For since nothing can be imagined better than God, how can we  doubt Him to be good than whom there is nothing better? Now, reason  shows God to be good in such wise as to prove that in Him is perfect  good. For were it not so, He would not be supreme of all things; for  there would be something else more excellent, possessed of perfect good,  which would seem to have the advantage in priority and dignity, since it  has clearly appeared that all perfect things are prior to those less  complete. Wherefore, lest we fall into an infinite regression, we must  acknowledge the supreme God to be full of supreme and perfect good. But  we have determined that true happiness is the perfect good; therefore  true happiness must dwell in the supreme Deity.'    'I accept thy reasonings,' said I; 'they cannot in any wise be  disputed.'    'But, come, see how strictly and incontrovertibly thou mayst prove this  our assertion that the supreme Godhead hath fullest possession of the  highest good.'    'In what way, pray?' said I.    'Do not rashly suppose that He who is the Father of all things hath  received that highest good of which He is said to be possessed either  from some external source, or hath it as a natural endowment in such  sort that thou mightest consider the essence of the happiness possessed,  and of the God who possesses it, distinct and different. For if thou  deemest it received from without, thou mayst esteem that which gives  more excellent than that which has received. But Him we most worthily  acknowledge to be the most supremely excellent of all things. If,  however, it is in Him by nature, yet is logically distinct, the thought  is inconceivable, since we are speaking of God, who is supreme of all"]]]
