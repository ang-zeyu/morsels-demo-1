Everybody knows how Mozartish, _e.g._,  Beethoven's first symphony is, and how much in turn Mozart's early  works smack of Haydn. Gradually, as courage comes with years, the  gifted composer sets out for unexplored forests and mountain ranges,  attempting to scale summits which none of his predecessors had trod. I  say, as courage comes, for in music, strange to say, it requires much  courage to give the world an entirely new thought. An original  composer needs not only the courage that is common to all explorers,  but he must invariably come back prepared to face the accusation that  his new territory is nothing but a howling wilderness of discords.  This has been the case quite recently with Wagner, as it was formerly  with Schumann, Beethoven, Mozart, the early Italian composers, and  many others, including even Rossini, who certainly did not deviate  very far from the beaten paths. Seyfried relates that when Beethoven  came across articles in which he was criticised for violating  established rules of composition, he used to rub his hands gleefully  and burst out laughing. \"Yes, yes!\" he exclaimed, \"that amazes them,  and makes them put their heads together, because they have not seen it  in any of their text-books.\"    Fortunately for their own peace of mind, the majority of the minor  composers never get beyond a mere rearrangement of remembered melodies  and modulations. Their minds are mere galleries of echoes. They write  for money or temporary notoriety, and not because their brains teem  with ideas that clamor for utterance. The pianist Hummel was one of  this class of composers. But whatever his short-comings, he had at  least, as Wagner admits, the virtue of frankness. For when he was  asked one day what thoughts or images he had in his mind when he  composed a certain concerto, he replied that he had been thinking of  the eighty ducats which his publisher had promised him!    Yet even the greatest composers cannot always command new thoughts at  will, and it is therefore of interest to note what devices some of  them resorted to rouse their dormant faculties. Weber's only pupil,  Sir Julius Benedict, relates that Weber spent many mornings in  \"learning by heart the words of 'Euryanthe,' which he studied until he  made them a portion of himself, his own creation, as it were. His  genius would sometimes lie dormant during his frequent repetitions of  the words, and then the idea of a whole musical piece would flash  upon his mind, like the bursting of light into darkness.\"    I have already referred to the manner in which Weber, while composing  certain parts of the \"Freischuetz,\" got his imagination into the proper  state of creative frenzy by picturing to himself his bride as if she  were singing new arias for him. Now, in one of Wagner's essays there  is a curious passage which seems to indicate that Wagner habitually  conjured his characters before his mental vision and made them sing to  him, as it were, his original melodies. He advises a young composer  who wishes to follow his example never to select a dramatic character  for whom he does not entertain a warm interest. \"He should divest him  of all theatrical apparel,\" he continues, \"and then imagine him in a  dim light, where he can only see the expression of his eyes. If these  speak to him, the figure itself is liable presently to make a  movement, which will perhaps alarm him--but to which he must submit;  at last the phantom's lips tremble, it opens its mouth, and a  supernatural voice tells him something that is entirely real, entirely  tangible, but at the same time so extraordinary (similar, for  instance, to what the ghostly statue, or the page _Cherubin_ told  Mozart) that it arouses him from his dream. The vision has  disappeared; but his inner ear continues to hear; an idea has  occurred to him, and this idea is a so-called musical _motive_.\"    As this passage implies, and as he has elsewhere explained at length,  Wagner looked on the mental process of composing as something  analogous to dreaming--as a sort of clairvoyance, which enables a  musician to dive down into the bottomless mysteries of the universe,  as it were, thence to bring up his priceless pearls of harmony.  According to the Kant-Schopenhauer philosophy, of which Wagner was a  disciple, objects or things in themselves do not exist in space and  time, which are mere forms under which the human mind beholds them. We  cannot conceive anything except as existing either in space or in  time. But there is one exception, according to Wagner, and that is  harmony. Harmony exists not in time, for the time-element in music is  melody; nor does it exist in space, for the simultaneousness of tones  is not one of extension or space. Hence our harmonic sense is not  hampered by the forms of the mind, but gives us a glimpse of things as  they are in themselves--a glimpse of the world as a superior spirit  would behold it. And hence the mysterious superterrestrial character  of such new harmonies as we find in the works of Wagner and  Chopin--which are unintelligible to ordinary mortals, while to the  initiated they come as revelations of a new world.    Without feeling the necessity of accepting all the consequences of  Wagner's mystical doctrine, which I have thus freely paraphrased, no  one can deny that the attitude of a composer in the moment of  inspiration is closely analogous to that known as clairvoyance. The  celebrated vocalist, Vogel, tells an anecdote of Schubert which shows  strikingly how completely this composer used to be transported to  another world, and become oblivious of self, when creating. On one  occasion Vogel received from Schubert some new songs, but being  otherwise occupied could not try them over at the moment. When he was  able to do so, he was particularly pleased with one of them, but as it  was too high for his voice, he had it copied in a lower key. About a  fortnight afterwards they were again making music together, and Vogel  placed the transposed song before Schubert on the desk of the piano.  Schubert tried it through, liked it, and said, in his Vienna dialect,  \"I say, the song's not so bad; _whose is it?_\" so completely, in a  fortnight, had it vanished from his mind. Grove recalls the fact that  Sir Walter Scott once similarly attributed a song of his own to Byron;  \"but this was in 1828, after his mind had begun to fail.\"    There is no reason for doubting Vogel's story when we bear in mind the  enormous fertility of Schubert. He was unquestionably the most  spontaneous musical genius that ever lived. Vogel, who knew him  intimately, used the very word _clairvoyance_ in referring to his  divine inspirations, and Sir George Grove justly remarks that, \"In  hearing Schubert's compositions, it is often as if one were brought  more immediately and closely into contact with music itself, than is  the case in the works of others; as if in his pieces the stream from  the great heavenly reservoir were dashing over us, or flowing through  us, more directly, with less admixture of any medium or channel, than  it does in those of any other writer--even of Beethoven himself. And  this immediate communication with the origin of music really seems to  have happened to him. No sketches, no delay, no anxious period of  preparation, no revision appear to have been necessary. He had but to  read the poem, to surrender himself to the torrent, and to put down  what was given him to say, as it rushed through his mind.\"    Schubert was the most omnivorous song composer that ever lived. He  could hardly see a poem--good, bad, or indifferent, without being at  once seized by a passionate desire to set it to music. He sometimes  wrote half a dozen or more songs in one day, and some of them  originated under the most peculiar circumstances. The serenade, \"Hark,  hark, the lark,\" for instance, was written in a beer garden. Schubert  had picked up a volume of Shakespeare accidentally lying on the  table. Presently he exclaimed, \"Such a lovely melody has come into my  head, if I only had some paper.\" One of his friends drew a few staves  on the back of a bill of fare, and on this Schubert wrote his  entrancing song. \"The Wanderer,\" so full of original details, was  written in one evening, and when he composed his \"Rastlose Liebe,\"  \"the paroxysm of inspiration,\" as Grove remarks, \"was so fierce that  Schubert never forgot it, but, reticent as he often was, talked of it  years afterward.\"    These stories remind one of an incident related by Goethe, who one day  suddenly found a poem spontaneously evolved in his mind, and so  complete that he ran to the desk and wrote it diagonally on a piece of  paper, fearing it might escape him if he took time to arrange the  paper.    In a word, Schubert _improvised with the pen_, and he seems to have  been an exception to Schopenhauer's rule, that the greatest writers  are those whose thoughts come to them before writing, and not while  writing. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that much of the music  which Schubert composed in this rapid manner is poor stuff; and  although his short songs are generally perfect in their way, his  longer compositions would have gained very much had he taken the  trouble to think them out beforehand, or to revise and condense them  afterward, which he very rarely did.    With a strange perversity and persistency, musical students and the  public have been led to believe that the surest sign of supreme  musical inspiration is the power to dash off melodies as fast as the  pen can travel. Weber relates in his autobiographic sketch that he  wrote the second act of one of his early operas in ten days, and adds,  significantly, that this was \"one of the many unfortunate results of  the wonderful anecdotes about great masters, which make a deep  impression on youthful minds, and incite them to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18564"],[0,"The Religion of Ancient Rome (#13)"],[1,"of augury. We may observe here, though our  evidence is much slighter, the same three stages which we have noticed  in the sacrificial worship, the homely domestic auspices, the auguries  of the agricultural life, and the organised system in the state.    In the household the use of auspices was in origin at any rate very  general indeed: 'Nothing,' Cicero tells us, 'of importance used to be  undertaken unless with the sanction of the auspices' (_auspicato_). The  right of interrogating the will of the gods, rested, as one might  expect, with the master of the house, assisted no doubt by the private  augur as the repository of lore and the interpreter of what the master  saw. But of the details of domestic augury we know but little. Cato in  one passage insists on the extreme importance of silence for the  purpose, and Festus suggests that this was secured by the master of the  house rising in the depths of the night to inspect the heavens. We have  seen already that the taking of the auspices played an important part  in the ceremonies of betrothal and marriage, and that the indications  of the divine will might be very varied we may gather from a story in  Cicero. An aunt wishing to take the auspices for her niece's betrothal,  conducted her into an open consecrated space (_sacellum_) and sat down  on the stool of augury (_sella_) with her niece standing at her side.  After a while the girl tired and asked her aunt to give her a little of  the stool: the aunt replied, 'My child, I give up my seat to you':  nothing further happened and this answer turned out in fact to be the  auspicious sign: the aunt died, the niece married the widower and so  became mistress of the house.    Of augury in agricultural life we have some indication in the annual  observance of the 'spring augury' (_augurium verniserum_) and the  midsummer ceremony of the _augurium canarium_, which seems to have been  a combination of the offering of a red dog (possibly to avert mildew)  and an augury for the success of the crops. To the rustic stratum  possibly belongs also the _augurium salutis populi_, though later it  was a yearly act celebrated whenever the Roman army was not at war and  so became connected with the shutting of the temple of Ianus.    The state greatly developed and organised the whole system of auguries  and auspices. The college of augurs ranked second only in importance to  the pontifical college, and their duties with regard to both augury and  auspice are sufficiently clear. Like the _pontifices_ in relation to  cult, they are the storehouse of all tradition, and to them appeal may  be made in all cases of doubt both public and private: they were  jealous of their secrets and in later times their mutual consciousness  of deception became proverbial. The right of augury--in origin simply  the inspection of the heavens--was theirs alone, and it was exercised  particularly on the annual occasions mentioned and at the installation  of priests, of which we get a typical instance in Livy's account of the  consecration of Numa.    The auspices on the other hand--in origin 'signs from birds' (_avis_,  _spicere_)--were the province of the magistrate about to undertake some  definite action on behalf of the state whether at home or on the field  of battle. Here the augur's functions were merely preparatory and  advisory. It was his duty to prepare the _templum_, the spot from which  the auspices are to be taken--always a square space, with boundaries  unbroken except at the entrance, not surrounded by wall or necessarily  by line, but clearly indicated (_effatus_) by the augur, and marked off  (_liberatus_) from the surroundings: in the comitia and other places in  Rome there were permanent _templa_, but elsewhere they must be  specially made. The magistrate then enters the _templum_ and observes  the signs (_spectio_): if there is any doubt as to interpretation--and  seeing the immense complication of the traditions (_disciplina_), this  must often have been the case--the augur is referred to as interpreter.  The signs demanded (_impetrativa_) were originally always connected  with the appearance, song or flight of birds--higher or lower, from  left to right or right to left, etc. Later others were included, and  with the army in the field it became the regular practice to take the  auspices from the feeding of the sacred chickens (_pulli_): the best  sign being obtained if, in their eagerness to feed, they let fall some  of the grain from their beaks (_tripudium solistimum_)--a result not  difficult to secure by previous treatment and a careful selection of  the kind of grain supplied to them. But besides this deliberate 'asking  for signs,' public business might at any moment be interrupted if the  gods voluntarily sent an indication of disapproval (_oblativa_): the  augurs then had always to be at hand to advise the magistrates whether  notice should be taken of such signs, and, if so, what was their  signification, and they even seem to have had certain rights of  reporting themselves (_nuntiatio_) the occurrence of adverse ones. The  sign of most usual occurrence would be lightning--sometimes such an  unexpected event as the seizure of a member of the assembly with  epilepsy (_morbus comitialis_)--and we know to what lengths political  obstructionists went in later times in the observation of fictitious  signs, or even the prevention of business by the mere announcement of  their intention to see an unfavourable omen (_servare de caelo_). The  complications and ramifications of the augur's art are infinite, but  the main idea should by now be plain, and it must be remembered that  the kindred art of the soothsayer (_haruspex_), oracles, and the  interpretation of fate by the drawing of lots (_sortes_) are all later  foreign introductions: auspice and augury are the only genuine Roman  methods for interpreting the will of the gods.    Here then in household, fields, and state, we have a second type of  relation to the gods, running parallel to the ordinary practice of  sacrifice and prayer, distinct yet not fundamentally different. As it  is man's function to propitiate the higher spirits and prevent, if  possible, the wrecking of his plans by their opposition, so it is his  business, if he can, to find out their intentions before he engages on  any serious undertaking. As in the _ius sacrum_ his legal mind leads  him to assume that the deities accept the responsibility of the  contract, when his own part is fulfilled, so here, like a practical man  of business, he assumes their construction of a code of communication,  which he has learned to interpret. In its origin it is a notion common  to many primitive religions, but in its elaboration it is peculiarly  and distinctively Italian, and, as we know it, Roman.          CHAPTER IX    RELIGION AND MORALITY--CONCLUSION      It might be said that a religion--the expression of man's relation to  the unseen--has not necessarily any connection with morality--man's  action in himself and towards his neighbours: that an individual--or  even a nation--might perfectly fulfil the duties imposed by the 'powers  above,' without being influenced in conduct and character. Such a view  might seem to find an apt illustration in the religion of Rome: the  ceremonial _pietas_ towards the gods appears to have little to do with  the making of man or nation. But in the history of the world the test  of religions must be their effect on the character of those who  believed in them: religion is no doubt itself an outcome of character,  but it reacts upon it, and must either strengthen or weaken. We are not  therefore justified in dismissing the 'Religion of Numa' without  inquiry as to its relation to morality, for on our answer to that  question must largely depend our judgment as to its value.    We are of course in a peculiarly difficult position to grapple with  this problem through lack of contemporary evidence. The Rome we know,  in the epochs when we can fairly judge of character and morality, was  not the Rome in which the 'Religion of Numa' had grown up and remained  unquestioned: it had been overlaid with foreign cults and foreign  ideas, had been used by priests and magistrates as a political  instrument, and discounted among the educated through the influence of  philosophy. But we may remember in the first place that even then,  especially in the household and in the country, the old religion had  probably a much firmer hold than one might imagine from literary  evidence, in the second that national character is not the growth of a  day, so that we may safely refer permanent characteristics to the  period when the old religion held its own.    It may be admitted at once that the direct influence on morality was  very small indeed. There was no table of commandments backed by the  religious sanction: the sense of 'sin,' except through breach of  ritual, was practically unknown. It is true that in the very early  _leges regiae_ some notion of this kind is seen--a significant glimpse  of what the original relation may have been: it is there ordained that  the patron who betrayed his client, or the client who deceived his  patron, shall be condemned to Iuppiter; the parricide to the spirits of  his dead ancestors, the husband who sells his wife to the gods of the  underworld, the man who removes his neighbour's landmark to Terminus,  the stealer of corn to Ceres. All these persons shall be _sacri_: they  have offended against the gods and the gods will see to their  punishment. But these are old-world notions which soon passed into the  background and the state took over the punishment of such offenders in  the ordinary course of law. Nor again in the prayers of men to gods is  there a trace of a petition for moral blessings: the magistrate prays  for the success and prosperity of the state, the farmer for the  fertility of his crops and herds, even the private individual,"]]]
