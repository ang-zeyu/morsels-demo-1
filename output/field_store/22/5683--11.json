I'm afraid you must go in alone, as I dare not leave  the animal even for a minute.\"    \"Oh, all right,\" I said. \"I don't mind, now that the ghost, or whatever  you like to call it, has gone; I'm myself again.\"    I jumped down, and threading my way along the bramble-entangled path,  reached the front door. On opening it, I hesitated. The big,  old-fashioned hall, with the great, frowning staircase leading to the  gallery overhead, the many open doors showing nought but bare, deserted  boards within, the grim passages, all moonlit and peopled only with  queer flickering shadows, suggested much that was terrifying. I fancied  I heard noises, noises like stealthy footsteps moving from room to  room, and tiptoeing along the passages and down the staircase. Once my  heart almost stopped beating as I saw what, at first, I took to be a  white face peering at me from a far recess, but which I eventually  discovered was only a daub of whitewash; and, once again, my hair all  but rose on end, when one of the doors at which I was looking swung open  and something came forth. Oh, the horror of that moment, as long as I  live I shall never forget it. The something was a cat, just a rather  lean but otherwise material, black Tom; yet, in the state my nerves were  then, it created almost as much horror as if it had been a ghost. Of  course, it was the figure of the walking man that was the cause of all  this nervousness; had it not appeared to me I should doubtless have  entered the house with the utmost sang-froid, my mind set on nothing but  the condition of the walls, drains, etc. As it was, I held back, and it  was only after a severe mental struggle I summoned up the courage to  leave the doorway and explore. Cautiously, very cautiously, with my  heart in my mouth, I moved from room to room, halting every now and then  in dreadful suspense as the wind, soughing through across the open land  behind the house, blew down the chimneys and set the window-frames  jarring. At the commencement of one of the passages I was immeasurably  startled to see a dark shape poke forward, and then spring hurriedly  back, and was so frightened that I dared not advance to see what it was.  Moment after moment sped by, and I still stood there, the cold sweat  oozing out all over me, and my eyes fixed in hideous expectation on the  blank wall. What was it? What was hiding there? Would it spring out on  me if I went to see? At last, urged on by a fascination I found  impossible to resist, I crept down the passage, my heart throbbing  painfully and my whole being overcome with the most sickly  anticipations. As I drew nearer to the spot, it was as much as I could  do to breathe, and my respiration came in quick jerks and gasps. Six,  five, four, two feet and I was at the dreaded angle. Another step--taken  after the most prodigious battle--and--NOTHING sprang out on me. I was  confronted only with a large piece of paper that had come loose from the  wall, and flapped backwards and forwards each time the breeze from  without rustled past it. The reaction after such an agony of suspense  was so great, that I leaned against the wall, and laughed till I cried.  A noise, from somewhere away in the basement, calling me to myself, I  went downstairs and investigated. Again a shock--this time more sudden,  more acute. Pressed against the window-pane of one of the front  reception-rooms was the face of a man--with corpse-like cheeks and pale,  malevolent eyes. I was petrified--every drop of my blood was congealed.  My tongue glued to my mouth, my arms hung helpless. I stood in the  doorway and stared at it. This went on for what seemed to me an  eternity. Then came a revelation. The face was not that of a ghost but  of Mr. Baldwin, who, getting alarmed at my long absence, had come to  look for me.    We left the premises together. All the way back to the town I  thought--should I, or should I not, take the house? Seen as I had seen  it, it was a ghoulish-looking place--as weird as a Paris catacomb--but  then daylight makes all the difference. Viewed in the sunshine, it would  be just like any other house--plain bricks and mortar. I liked the  situation; it was just far enough away from a town to enable me to  escape all the smoke and traffic, and near enough to make shopping easy.  The only obstacles were the shadows--the strange, enigmatical shadows I  had seen in the hall and passages, and the figure of the walker. Dare I  take a house that knew such visitors? At first I said no, and then yes.  Something, I could not tell what, urged me to say yes. I felt that a  very grave issue was at stake--that a great wrong connected in some  manner with the mysterious figure awaited righting, and that the hand  of Fate pointed at me as the one and only person who could do it.    \"Are you sure the house isn't haunted?\" I demanded, as we slowly rolled  away from the iron gate, and I leaned back in my seat to light my pipe.    \"Haunted!\" Mr. Baldwin scoffed, \"why, I thought you didn't believe in  ghosts--laughed at them.\"    \"No more I do believe in them,\" I retorted, \"but I have children, and we  know how imaginative children are.\"    \"I can't undertake to stop their imaginations.\"    \"No, but you can tell me whether anyone else has imagined anything  there. Imagination is sometimes very infectious.\"    \"As far as I know, then, no; leastways, I have not heard tell of it.\"    \"Who was the last tenant?\"    \"Mr. Jeremiah Dance.\"    \"Why did he leave?\"    \"How do I know? Got tired of being there, I suppose.\"    \"How long was he there?\"    \"Nearly three years.\"    \"Where is he now?\"    \"That's more than I can say. Why do you wish to know?\"    \"Why!\" I repeated. \"Because it is more satisfactory to me to hear about  the house from someone who has lived in it. Has he left no address?\"    \"Not that I know of, and it's more than two years since he was here.\"    \"What! The house has been empty all that time?\"    \"Two years is not very long. Houses--even town houses--are frequently  unoccupied for longer than that. I think you'll like it.\"    I did not speak again till the drive was over, and we drew up outside  the landlord's house. I then said, \"Let me have an agreement. I've made  up my mind to take it. Three years and the option to stay on.\"    That was just like me. Whatever I did, I did on the spur of the moment,  a mode of procedure that often led me into difficulties.    A month later and my wife, children, servants, and I were all ensconced  in the Crow's Nest.    That was in the beginning of October. Well, the month passed by, and  November was fairly in before anything remarkable happened. It then came  about in this fashion.    Jennie, my eldest child, a self-willed and rather bad-tempered girl of  about twelve, evading the vigilance of her mother, who had forbidden her  to go out as she had a cold, ran to the gate one evening to see if I was  anywhere in sight. Though barely five o'clock, the moon was high in the  sky, and the shadows of the big trees had already commenced their  gambols along the roadside.    Jennie clambered up the gate as children do, and peering over, suddenly  espied what she took to be me, striding towards the house, at a swinging  pace, and followed by two poodles.    \"Poppa,\" she cried, \"how cute of you! Only to think of you bringing home  two doggies! Oh, Poppa, naughty Poppa, what will mum say?\" and climbing  over into the lane at imminent danger to life and limb, she tore  frantically towards the figure. To her dismay, however, it was not me,  but a stranger with a horribly white face and big glassy eyes which he  turned down at her and stared. She was so frightened that she fainted,  and some ten minutes later I found her lying out there on the road. From  the description she gave me of the man and dogs, I felt quite certain  they were the figures I had seen; though I pretended the man was a  tramp, and assured her she would never see him again. A week passed, and  I was beginning to hope nothing would happen, when one of the servants  gave notice to leave.    At first she would not say why she did not like the house, but when  pressed made the following statement:--    \"It's haunted, Mrs. B----. I can put up with mice and beetles, but not  with ghosts. I've had a queer sensation, as if water was falling down my  spine, ever since I've been here, but never saw anything till last  night. I was then in the kitchen getting ready to go to bed. Jane and  Emma had already gone up, and I was preparing to follow them, when, all  of a sudden, I heard footsteps, quick and heavy, cross the gravel and  approach the window.    \"'The boss,' says I to myself; 'maybe he's forgot the key and can't get  in at the front door.'    \"Well, I went to the window and was about to throw it open, when I got  an awful shock. Pressed against the glass, looking in at me, was a  face--not the boss's face, not the face of anyone living, but a horrid  white thing with a drooping mouth and wide-open, glassy eyes, that had  no more expression in them than a pig. As sure as I'm standing here,  Mrs. B----, it was the face of a corpse--the face of a man that had died  no natural death. And by its side, standing on their hind-legs, and  staring in at me too were two dogs, both poodles--also no living things,  but dead, horribly dead. Well, they stared at me, all three of them, for  perhaps a minute, certainly not less, and then vanished. That's why I'm  leaving, Mrs. B----. My heart was never overstrong. I always suffered  with palpitations, and if I saw those heads again, it would kill me.\"    After this my wife spoke to me seriously.    \"Jack,\" she said, \"are you sure there's nothing in it? I don't think  Mary would leave us without a good cause, and the description of what  she saw tallies exactly with the figure that frightened Jennie. Jennie  assures me she never said a word about it to the servants. They can't  both have imagined"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18237"],[0,"A Bird Calendar for Northern India (#13)"],[1,"-like heat.  Small wonder then that the advent of the creative monsoon is more  heartily welcomed in India than is spring in England. No sound is more  pleasing to the human ear than the drumming of the first monsoon rain.    But alas! the physical relief brought by the monsoon is only  temporary. The temperature rises the moment the rain ceases to fall,  and the prolonged breaks in the rains that occur every year render the  last state of the climate worse than the first. The air is so charged  with moisture that it cannot absorb the perspiration that emanates  from the bodies of the human beings condemned to existence in this  humid Inferno. For weeks together we live in a vapour-bath, and to the  physical discomfort of perpetual clamminess is added the irritation of  prickly heat.    Moreover, the rain brings with it myriads of torments in the form of  termites, beetles, stinking bugs, flies, mosquitoes and other creeping  and flying things, which bite and tease and find their way into every  article of food and drink. The rain also awakens from their slumbers  the frogs that have hibernated and aestivated in the sun-baked beds of  dried-up ditches and tanks. These awakened amphibia fill the welkin  with their croakings, which take the place of the avian chorus at  night. The latter ceases with dramatic abruptness with the first fall  of monsoon rain. During the monsoon the silence of the night is broken  only by the sound of falling raindrops, or the croaking of the frogs,  the stridulation of crickets innumerable, and the owlet's feeble call.  Before the coming of the monsoon the diurnal chorus of the day birds  begins to flag because the nesting season for many species is drawing  to a close. The magpie-robin still pours forth his splendid song, but  the quality of the music in the case of many individuals is already  beginning to fall off. The rollers, which are feeding their young, are  far less noisy than they were at the time of courtship. The barbets  and coppersmiths, although not so vociferous as formerly, cannot, even  in the monsoon, be charged with hiding their lights under a bushel.  Towards the end of June the _chuk_, _chuk_, _chuk_, _chuk_, _chuk_ of  Horsfield's nightjar is not often heard, but the bird continues to  utter its soft churring note. The iora's cheerful calls still resound  through the shady mango tope. The sunbirds, the fantail flycatchers,  the orioles, the golden-backed woodpeckers, the white-breasted  kingfishers and the black partridges call as lustily as ever, and the  bulbuls continue to twitter to one another \"stick to it!\" With the  first fall of rain the tunes of the paradise flycatchers and the  king-crows change. The former now cry \"Witty-ready wit,\" softly and  gently, while the calls of the latter suddenly become sweet and  mellow.    Speaking generally, the monsoon seems to exercise a sobering, a  softening influence on the voices of the birds. The pied myna forms  the one exception; he does not come into his full voice until the  rains have set in.    The monsoon transfigures the earth. The brown, dry, hard countryside,  with its dust-covered trees, becomes for the time being a shallow lake  in which are studded emerald islets innumerable. Stimulated by the  rain many trees put forth fresh crops of leaves. At the first break in  the downpour the cultivators rush forth with their ploughs and oxen to  prepare the soil for the autumn crops with all the speed they may.    There is much to interest the ornithologist in June.    Of the birds whose nests have been previously described the following  are likely to have eggs or young: white-eyes, ioras, tailor-birds,  king-crows, robins, sparrows, tree-pies, seven sisters,  cuckoo-shrikes, Indian wren-warblers (second brood), sunbirds (second  brood), swifts, fantail flycatchers (second brood), orioles, paradise  flycatchers, grey horn-bills, and the various mynas, bulbuls,  butcher-birds, doves, pigeons and lapwings. The following species have  young which either are in the nest or have only recently left it:  roller, hoopoe, brown rock-chat, magpie-robin, coppersmith, green  barbet, nightjar, white-eyed buzzard, pipit, wire-tailed swallow,  white-breasted kingfisher, grey partridge, kite, golden-backed  woodpecker (second brood), and the several species of bee-eater and  lark.    With June the breeding season for the blue rock and green pigeons  ends. In the _sal_ forests the young jungle-fowl have now mostly  hatched out and are following the old hens, or feeding independently.    Some of the minivets are beginning to busy themselves with a second  brood.    The breeding operations of a few species begin in June.    Chief of these is that arch-villain _Corvus splendens_--the Indian  house-crow. Crows have no fine feathers, hence the cocks do not  \"display\" before the hens. To sing they know not how. Their courtship,  therefore, provides a feast for neither the eye nor the ear of man.  The lack of ornaments and voice perhaps explains the fact that among  crows there is no noisy love-making. Crows make a virtue of necessity.  Any attempt at courtship after the style of the costermonger is  resented by the whole corvine community. The only amorous display  permitted in public is head-tickling. The cock and the hen perch side  by side, one ruffles the feathers of the neck, the other inserts its  bill between the ruffled feathers of its companion and gently tickles  its neck, to the accompaniment of soft gurgles.    Crows are the most intelligent of birds. Like the other fowls of the  air in which the brain is well developed, they build rough untidy  nests--mere platforms placed in the fork of a branch of almost any  kind of tree. The usual materials used in nest-construction are twigs,  but crows do not limit themselves to these. They seem to take a  positive pride in pressing into service materials of an uncommon  nature. Cases are on record of nests composed entirely of  spectacle-frames, wires used for the fixing of the corks of soda-water  bottles, or pieces of tin discarded by tinsmiths.    Four, five or six eggs are laid; these are of a pale greenish-blue  hue, speckled or flaked with sepia markings. The hen alone collects  the materials for the nest, but the cock supervises her closely,  following her about and criticising her proceedings as she picks up  twigs and works them into the nest.    From the time of the laying of the first egg until the moment of the  departure of the last young bird, one or other of the parents always  mounts guard over the nest, except when they are chasing a koel. Crows  are confirmed egg-lifters and chicken-stealers; they apply their  standard of morality to other birds, and, in consequence, never leave  their own offspring unguarded. A crow's nest at which there is no  adult crow certainly contains neither eggs nor young birds.    As has already been stated, crows spend, much time in teasing and  annoying other birds. Retribution overtakes them in the nesting  season. The Indian koel (_Eudynamis honorata_) cuckolds them. The  crows either are aware of this or have an instinctive dislike to this  cuckoo. The sight of the koel affects a crow in much the same way as a  red cloth irritates a bull. One of these cuckoos has but to perch in a  tree that contains a crow's nest and begin calling in order to make  both the owners of the nest attack him. The koel takes full advantage  of this fact. The cock approaches the nest and begins uttering his  fluty _kuil_, _kuil_. The crows forthwith dash savagely at him. He  flies off pursued by them. He can easily outdistance his pursuers, but  is content to keep a lead of a few feet, crying _pip-pip_ or  _kuil-kuil_, and thus he lures the parent crows to some distance. No  sooner are their backs turned than the hen koel slips quietly into the  nest and deposits an egg in it. If she have time she carries off or  throws out one or more of the legitimate eggs. When the crows return  to the nest, having failed to catch the cock koel, they do not appear  to notice the trick played upon them, although the koel's egg is  smaller than theirs and of an olive-green colour. Through the greater  part of June and July the koels keep the crows busy chasing them.  Something approaching pandemonium reigns in the neighbourhood of a  colony of nesting crows: from dawn till nightfall the shrieks and  yells of the koels mingle with the harsh notes of the crows.    Sometimes the crows return from the chase of the cock koel before the  hen is ready, and surprise her in the nest; then they attack her. She  flees in terror, and is followed by the corvi. Her screams when being  thus pursued are loud enough to awaken the Seven Sleepers. She has  cause for alarm, for, if the raging crows catch her, they will  assuredly kill her. Such a tragedy does sometimes occur.    Not infrequently it happens that more than one koel's egg is laid in a  crow's nest.    The incubation period of the egg of the koel is shorter than that of  the crow, the consequence is that when, as usually happens, there is  one of the former and several of the latter in a nest, the young koel  is invariably the first to emerge. It does not attempt to eject from  the nest either the legitimate eggs or the young crows when they  appear on the scene. Indeed, it lives on excellent terms with its  foster brethren. But to say this is to anticipate, for as a rule,  neither young koels nor baby crows hatch out until July.    The crow-pheasants (_Centropus sinensis_), which are cuckoos that do  not lead a parasitic existence, are now busy with nursery duties. The  nest of the crow-pheasant or coucal is a massive structure, globular  in shape, with the entrance at one side. Large as the nest is, it is  not often discovered by the naturalist because it is almost invariably  situated in the midst of an impenetrable thicket. Three or four  pure-white eggs are laid.    The white-necked storks or beef-steak birds (_Dissu"]]]
