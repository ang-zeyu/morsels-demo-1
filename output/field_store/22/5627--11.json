Moreover, the payment of tribute is not the only condition  enjoined by the Koran. \"Fight against them (the Jews and Christians)  until they pay tribute with the hand, _and are humbled_.\"[50] The  command fell on willing ears. An ample interpretation was given to it.  And so it came to pass that, though Jews and Christians were, on the  payment of tribute, tolerated in the profession of their ancestral  faith, they were yet subjected (and still are subjected) to severe  humiliation. The nature and extent of the degradation to which they were  brought down, and the strength of the inducement to purchase exemption  and the equality of civil rights, by surrendering their religion, may be  learned from the provisions which were embodied in the code named _The  Ordinance of Omar_, which has been more or less enforced from the  earliest times. Besides the tribute and various other imposts levied  from the \"People of the Book,\"[51] and the duty of receiving Moslem  travelers quartered upon them, the dress of both sexes must be  distinguished by broad stripes of yellow. They are forbidden to appear  on horseback, and if mounted on a mule or ass their stirrups must be of  wood, and their saddles known by knobs of the same material. Their  graves must not rise above the level of the soil, and the devil's mark  is placed upon the lintel of their doors. Their children must be taught  by Moslem masters, and the race, however able or well qualified,  proscribed from any office of high emolument or trust. Besides the  churches spared at the time of conquest no new buildings can be erected  for the purposes of worship; nor can free entrance into their holy  places at pleasure be refused to the Moslem. No cross must remain in  view outside, nor any church-bells be rung. They must refrain from  processions in the street at Easter, and other solemnities; and from any  thing, in short, whether by outward symbol, word, or deed, which could  be construed into rivalry, or competition with the ruling faith. Such  was the so-called _Code of Omar_. Enforced with less or greater  stringency, according to the intolerance and caprice of the day, by  different dynasties, it was, and (however much relaxed in certain  countries) it still remains, the law of Islam. One must admire the rare  tenacity of the Christian faith, which, with but scanty light and hope,  held its ground through weary ages of insult and depression, and still  survives to see the dawning of a brighter day.[52]    [Sidenote: Continuing inducements in times of peace.]  Such, then, was the hostile attitude of Islam militant in its early  days; such the pressure brought to bear on conquered lands for its  acceptance; and such the disabilities imposed upon recusant Jews and  Christians. On the one hand, rapine, plunder, slavery, tribute, civil  disability; on the other, security, peace, and honor. We need not be  surprised that, under such constraint, conquered peoples succumbed  before Islam. Nor were the temporal inducements to conversion confined  to the period during which the Saracens were engaged in spreading Islam  by force of arms. Let us come down a couple of centuries from the time  of Mohammed, and take the reign of the tolerant and liberal-minded  sovereign, Al Mamun.    [Sidenote: Evidence of Al Kindy in second century of Hegira, A.D. 830.  Speech of Al Mamun.]  Among the philosophers of all creeds whom that great caliph gathered  around him at Bagdad was a noble Arab of the Nestorian faith, descended  from the kingly tribe of the Beni Kinda, and hence called _Al Kindy_. A  friend of this Eastern Christian, himself a member of the royal family,  invited Al Kindy to embrace Islam in an epistle enlarging on the  distinguished rank which, in virtue of his descent, he would (if a true  believer) occupy at court, and the other privileges, spiritual and  material, social and conjugal, which he would enjoy. In reply the  Christian wrote an apology of singular eloquence and power, throwing a  flood of light on the worldly inducements which, even at that  comparatively late period, abounded in a Moslem state to promote  conversion to Islam. Thus Al Mamun himself, in a speech delivered before  his council, characterizes certain of his courtiers accused as secret  adherents of the Zoroastrian faith:         \"Though professing Islam, they are free from the same. This they do       to be seen of me, while their convictions, I am well aware, are       just the opposite of that which they profess. They belong to a       class which embrace Islam, not from any love of this our faith, but       thinking thereby to gain access to our court, and share in the       honor, wealth, and power of the realm. They have no inward       persuasion of that which they outwardly profess.\"[53]    [Sidenote: Converts from sordid motives.]  Again, speaking of the various classes brought over to Islam by sordid  and unworthy motives, Al Kindy says:         Moreover, there are the idolatrous races--Magians and Jews--low       people aspiring by the profession of Islam to raise themselves to       riches and power and to form alliances with the families of the       learned and honorable. There are, besides, hypocritical men of the       world, who in this way obtain indulgences in the matter of marriage       and concubinage which are forbidden to them by the Christian faith.       Then we have the dissolute class given over wholly to the lusts of       the flesh. And lastly there are those who by this means obtain a       more secure and easy livelihood.[54]    [Sidenote: Al Kindy contrasts the Christian confessor with the Moslem  \"martyr.\"  The Christian confessor and the Moslem martyr.]  Before leaving this part of our subject it may be opportune to quote a  few more passages from Al Kindy, in which he contrasts the inducements  that, under the military and political predominance of Islam, promoted  its rapid spread, and the opposite conditions under which Christianity  made progress, slow, indeed, comparatively, but sure and steady. First,  he compares the Christian confessor with the Moslem \"martyr:\"         I marvel much, he says, that ye call those _martyrs_ that fall in       war. Thou hast read, no doubt, in history of the followers of       Christ put to death in the persecutions of the kings of Persia and       elsewhere. Say, now, which are the more worthy to be called       martyrs, these, or thy fellows that fall fighting for the world and       the power thereof? How diverse were the barbarities and kinds of       death inflicted on the Christian confessors! The more they were       slain the more rapidly spread the faith; in place of one sprang up       a hundred. On a certain occasion, when a great multitude had been       put to death, one at court said to the king, \"The number of them       increaseth instead of, as thou thinkest, diminishing.\" \"How can       that be?\" exclaimed the king. \"But yesterday,\" replied the       courtier, \"thou didst put such and such a one to death, and lo,       there were converted double that number; and the people say that a       man appeared to the confessors from heaven strengthening them in       their last moments.\" Whereupon the king himself was converted. In       those days men thought not their lives dear unto them. Some were       transfixed while yet alive; others had their limbs cut off one       after another; some were cast to the wild beasts and others burned       in the fire. Such continued long to be the fate of the Christian       confessors. No parallel is found thereto in any other religion; and       all was endured with constancy and even with joy. One smiled in the       midst of his great suffering. \"Was it cold water,\" they asked,       \"that was brought unto thee?\" \"No,\" answered the sufferer, \"it was       one like a youth that stood by me and anointed my wounds; and that       made me smile, for the pain forthwith departed.\"         Now tell me seriously, my friend, which of the two hath the best       claim to be called a _martyr_, \"slain in the ways of the Lord:\" he       who surrendereth his life rather than renounce his faith; who, when       it is said, Fall down and worship the sun and moon, or the idols of       silver and gold, work of men's hands, instead of the true God,       refuseth, choosing rather to give up life, abandon wealth, and       forego even wife and family; or he that goeth forth, ravaging and       laying waste, plundering and spoiling, slaying the men, carrying       away their children into captivity, and ravishing their wives and       maidens in his unlawful embrace, and then shall call it \"Jehad in       the ways of the Lord!\" ... And not content therewith, instead of       humbling thyself before the Lord, and seeking pardon for the crime,       thou sayest of such a one slain in the war that \"he hath earned       paradise,\" and thou namest him \"a martyr in the ways of the       Lord!\"[55]    And again, contrasting the spread of Islam, \"its rattling quiver and its  glittering sword,\" with the silent progress of Christianity, our  apologist, after dwelling on the teaching and the miracles of the  apostles, writes:         They published their message by means of these miracles; and thus       great and powerful kings and philosophers and learned men and       judges of the earth hearkened unto them, without lash or rod, with       neither sword nor spear, nor the advantages of birth or       \"Helpers;\"[56] with no wisdom of this world, or eloquence or power       of language, or subtlety of reason; with no worldly inducement, nor       yet again with any relaxation of the moral law, but simply at the       voice of truth enforced by miracles beyond the power of man to       show. And so there came over to them the kings and great ones of       the earth. And the philosophers abandoned their systems, with all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16997"],[0,"A Journey through the Kingdom of Oude, Volumes I & II (#13)"],[1,". His chief wife  would poison him to bring on the throne her son, and restore to her  her paramour, who is now at Cawnpoor, waiting for such a change. Her  uncle, the minister, would, the King thinks, be glad to see him  poisoned, in the hope of having to conduct affairs during the  minority. He is afraid to admonish his other wife for her  infidelities with the chief favourite and singer, lest she should  poison him to go off with her paramour to Rampoor, whither he has  sent the immense wealth that the King has lavished upon him.    The whole family are most anxious that the King should resign the  reins into abler hands, and would, I feel assured, hail the  arrangement I have proposed as a blessing to them and the country.  All seems ripe for the change, and I hope the Governor-General will  consent to its being proposed soon. Any change in the ministry would  now be an obstacle to the arrangement, and such a change might happen  any morning. At the head of the Board, or Regency, I should put  Mohsin-od Dowla, grandson of Ghazee-od Deen, the first King, and son-  in-law of Moohummed Alee Shah, the third King. His only son has been  lately united in marriage to the King's daughter. He is looked up to  as the first man in Oude for character, and the most able member of  the royal family. He is forty-five years of age. I should probably  put two of the King's uncles in as the other members, Azeemoshan and  Mirza Khorum Buksh, whose names you will find in the short appended  list of those who have received no stipends since the present King  ascended the throne. These princes cannot visit, the Resident except  when they accompany the King himself, so that I have never seen the  two last that I recollect, and only once conversed with the first.  But their characters stand very high. They are never admitted to the  King, nor have they seen him for more than a year, I believe.    The King will probably object to members of his family forming the  Board, but I dare say I shall be able to persuade him of the  advantage of it. Such a Board, so constituted, would be a pledge to  all India of the honesty of our intentions, and secure to us the  cordial good-will of all who are interested in the welfare of the  family and the good government of the country.    I should persuade the members to draw from the _elite_ of their own  creed in our service to aid in forming and carrying out the new  system in their several departments. We can give them excellent men  in the revenue and judicial branches, who will be glad to come when  assured that they will not be removed so long as they do their duty  ably and honestly, and will get pensions if their services are  dispensed with after a time. This is all I shall say at present.                             Yours sincerely,                        (Signed)      W. H. SLEEMAN.    To Sir H. M. Elliot, K.C.B.,          &c.   &c.              ___________________________________                                                              Lucknow.    My Lord,    My Official Report went off on the 25th instant, and will have been  submitted, for your Lordship's consideration. It contains, I believe,  a faithful description of the abuses that exist and require remedy,  and of the obstacles which will be opposed to their removal. But it  does not tell all that might be told of the King himself, who has  become an object of odium and contempt to all but those few  despicable persons with whom he associates exclusively. He eats,  drinks, sleeps, and converses with the singers and eunuchs and  females alone, and the only female who has any influence over him is  the sister of the chief singer, Rusee-od Dowlah, whom he calls his  own sister. No member of the royal family or aristocracy of Oude is  ever admitted to speak to or see his Majesty, and these contemptible  singers are admitted to more equality and familiarity than his own  brothers or sons ever were; they go out, too, with greater pomp than  they or any of the royal family can; and are ordered to be received  with more honours as they pass through the different palaces. The  profligacy that exists within the palace passes all belief, and these  things excite more disgust among the aristocracy of the capital than  all the misrule and malversation that arise from the King's apathy  and incapacity.    Should your Lordship resolve upon interposing effectually to remedy  these disorders, I think it will be necessary to have at Lucknow, for  at least the first few months, a corps of irregular cavalry. We have  no cavalry in Oude, and none of the King's can be depended upon. The  first thing necessary will be the disbanding of the African, or  Hubshee corps, of three hundred men. They are commanded by one of the  eunuchs, and a fellow fit for any dark purpose. They were formed into  a corps, I believe, because no man's life was safe in Lucknow while  they were loose upon society.    I think the King will consent without much difficulty or reluctance  to delegate his powers to a Regency, but I am somewhat afraid that he  will object to its being composed of members of his own family. The  Sovereign has always been opposed to employing any of his own  relatives in office. I shall, I dare say, be able to get over this  difficulty, and it will be desirable to employ the best members of  the family in order to show the people of Oude, and of India  generally, that the object of our Government is an honest and  benevolent one.    A corps of irregular cavalry might be sent to Lucknow from  Goruckpoor, and its place there supplied for a season by a wing from  the corps at Legolee. There is little occasion for the services of  cavalry at either of these places at present. Without any cavalry of  our own here, and with this corps of African assassins at Lucknow at  the beck of the singers, eunuchs, and their creature, the minister,  neither the Resident nor any of the Regency would be safe. The  treasury and crown jewels would be open to any one who would make  away with them. If, therefore, your Lordship should determine upon  offering the king the alternative proposed, no time should be lost in  ordering the irregular corps from Goruckpoor to Lucknow, to be held  at the Resident's disposal. Its presence will be required only for a  few months.    I have mentioned, in my private letter to Sir H. M. Elliot, three  persons of high character for the Regency. Two of them are brothers  of the King's father. The third, and best, may be considered as in  all respects the first man in Oude. Mohsin-od Dowlah is the grandson  of the King, Ghasee-od Deen; his wife, and the mother of his only  son, is the sister of the King's father, and his only son has been  lately united in marriage to the present King's daughter. He and his  wife have large hereditary incomes, under the guarantee of our  Government, and his character for good sense, prudence, and integrity  stands higher, I believe, than that of any other man in Oude.    All three belong to the number of the royal family who never visit  the Resident except in company with the King, and I have, in  consequence, never spoken to Mohsin-od Dowlah but once, and never  seen either of the other two whom I have named, Azeemoshan and Khorum  Bukeh, the King's uncles. The characters of all three are very high,  and in general esteem.    Things are coming to a very critical state. There is no money to pay  any one in the treasury, and the greater part of what comes in is  taken for private purposes, by those who are in power. All see that  there must soon be a great change, and are anxious \"to make hay while  the sun shines.\" The troops are everywhere in a state bordering on  mutiny, but more particularly in and about the capital, because they  cannot indemnify themselves by the plunder of the people as those in  the distant districts do.    Fortunately the rains have this season been very favourable for  tillage, and the crops may be good if we can preserve them by, some  timely arrangement.           With great respect I remain,             Your Lordship's obedient, humble servant,                     (Signed)        W. H. SLEEMAN.    To the Most Noble  the Marquis of Dalhousie.    P.S.--I find that the irregular corps of cavalry has been moved from  Goruckpoor to Sultanpoor Benares, and that Lagolee and Goruckpoor  have now only one corps between them.    The Sultanpoor Benares corps might well spare a wing for Lucknow, and  so might the corps at Bareilly spare one.                   (Signed)     W. H. SLEEMAN.                       ______________________________                                            Lucknow, 11th October, 1849.    My Dear Elliot,    Here is a little item of palace news, communicated by one of the  poets who has to assist his Majesty in selecting his verses, and who  knows a good deal about what is going on among the favourites.  Perhaps you may recollect him, Ameen-od Doulah, the eldest son of the  late Aga Meer.    There is not a greater knave than Walee Alee in India, I believe.  That his Majesty will consent to what the Governor-General may  authorise us to propose I have no doubt, for he and his family are by  this time satisfied that we shall propose nothing but what is good  for them and the people of Oude.    But the King is no longer in a sound state of mind, and will say and  do whatever the most plausible of the bad speakers may recommend.  When I see him, I must have his signature before respectable  witnesses to all his answers to distinct propositions, and act upon  them at once, as far as I may be authorised by the Governor-General,  or nothing will be done. It would not do for me to commune with him  about affairs till I get instructions from you, as he would be sure  to tell the singers, eunuchs, and minister all that has been said the  moment I left him.    He has never been a cruel or badly-disposed man, but his mind,  naturally weak, has entirely given way, and is now "]]]
