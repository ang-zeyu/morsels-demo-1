Now, so far as I understand the bill as proposed, the only one of  these recommendations included in it is the tax. I am wrong in  this--the taxation is not included in the bill, but was suggested  by Mr. Eden at the meeting he attended lately at Chester. The bill  proposes that the choice of conservators shall be vested in the  magistrates at quarter sessions, and the conservators shall have  power to expend all the funds raised by voluntary subscriptions  for certain purposes mentioned in the act. But Mr. Eden suggested  at Chester that if these funds were inadequate the conservators  should have the power of supplementing them by a rate on the  owners and lessees of fisheries in proportion to their extent. Now  one man may have an estate on the banks of a river extending for  miles from which he derives little or no revenue; while another  may have a fishery not extending more yards than the other does  miles, but from which he derives a revenue of as many pounds as  the other does pence. If Mr. Eden's meaning is lineal extent, I  feel very sure it will not meet with the approval of the upper  riparian proprietors. Again, why should the magistrates in quarter  sessions (nine-tenths of whom know nothing of Salmon or Salmon  rivers) choose the conservators? What, for instance, would the  magistrates meeting at Wakefield know of the Ribble or the Hodder?  What would they care about the matter? They would choose the men  who had power to tax the riparian proprietors and lessees; but as  they would not be taxed themselves, they would look on with great  composure. No; if we are to be taxed, let us tax ourselves, and  not leave it to those who will have no interest in the matter, and  who may involve us in litigation and expense over which we shall  have no control.    The recommendations of the Worcester committee deserved more  consideration on the part of Government. They were suggested by  men of great experience, and, moreover, unless they are adopted  and legalized by Parliament there can be no permanent prosperity  for Salmon rivers. Take the extension of close time as an  instance. It cannot be right that the owners or lessees of estuary  fisheries shall be allowed to take ninety per cent. of the fish  which they have neither bred nor fed, and whose well-being and  increase they have done nothing to promote; while the upper  proprietors, on whom devolve all the care, trouble, and expense,  are to rest satisfied with what the thirty-six hours per week can  give them. What did they give the upper proprietors on the Ribble  and the Hodder last season? Little or nothing. When the bill of  1861 was before the House of Commons, I had an opportunity of  suggesting (indirectly) to the late Sir George Cornewall Lewis the  propriety and desirableness of an extension of the weekly close  time for the benefit of the upper proprietors. He replied, \"You  might as well propose to restrict the shooting of partridges to  three days a week as to restrict the netting of Salmon.\" But with  all due deference to so great an authority, there is no analogy  between the two cases. If partridges had all to migrate and return  before they could be legally shot, and had, like the Salmon, all  to return by the same road, ninety per cent. of them before  reaching the district where they were reared would become the prey  of men who had neither bred nor fed them. I fancy sportsmen would  want protection for them; and if they were not able to obtain it,  they would do what is seriously proposed by many people with  regard to the Salmon--they would do all they could to exterminate  them, rather than continue to act as brood hens to hatch chickens  for other men's eating.    Then take the annual close time and the pretended compensation it  offers in the two months' rod-fishing (September and October).  After the nets have been withdrawn, what is it worth? Or, what is  the value of black fish full of spawn? They cannot be sold; they  are not fit to eat; the spawn has nearly arrived at maturity, and  the only value the fish has is in the spawn, which is potted and  sold in many instances by the poacher who kills the fish. He  deserves no other name, whatever may be his rank or station.    Again, in the 21st section, regulating the weekly close time, it  is enacted \"That any person acting in contravention of this  section shall forfeit all the fish taken by him, and any net or  movable instrument used by him in taking the same, and, in  addition thereto, shall incur a penalty of not exceeding five  pounds, and a further penalty of not exceeding one pound for each  fish.\" But in the 17th section, which regulates the annual close  time, though there is a penalty for the contravention and  forfeiture of the Salmon so taken, there is no forfeiture of nets  and implements. You will no doubt remember how this worked when  the watchers took a net and boat, near Preston, last season, after  the setting in of the annual close time. How the owner of the net  and boat came to claim them, on the pretence that the net had been  stolen from the bank, where it had been left to dry, although his  own men were the parties who were so illegally using them.    Minimum penalties.--I see no mention of them in the new bill,  although it is notorious that many magistrates have fined  convicted poachers in the penalty of a farthing or a shilling.  What is this but an encouragement to do so again?    Close time for Trout.--This is greatly needed in Salmon rivers, as  it is well known that many a poacher pretends to be fishing for  Trout when he is looking after Salmon. This is doubly needed when  the Salmon ascend the small tributaries to spawn.    The right of way for water bailiffs.--There is no clause or  section in the new bill giving the right of way on the banks of  Salmon rivers to duly authorized persons without their being  deemed guilty of trespass. But there is one by which they are  permitted to examine weirs. There is on my part no objection to  this examination, but why are millowners stigmatized by being  subjected to exceptional legislation? Are not the gamekeepers of  gentlemen who have many miles of river subject to no surveillance  on the part of the water bailiffs as likely to act illegally as  the servants of the millowners? Let both be watched with equal  care, and I do not mind how vigilant the watching may be; but I do  object to being made the object of special and exceptional  legislation. The tax ought to be upon nets and rods and other  implements in proportion to their value. But if a tax is laid on  the extent of the fishery, we may bid adieu to voluntary  subscriptions.    In conclusion, if Mr. Eden comes into this district, I think it  ought to be distinctly intimated to him that no bill would be  satisfactory to the upper proprietors which did not give them a  greater interest in the increase and improvement of rivers. There  are three ways of doing this. The mesh of the Salmon net might be  enlarged from eight to twelve inches round. This would allow  grilse to pass, and fill the river with breeding fish. Or,  secondly, the weekly close time might be extended so as to include  Friday as well as Saturday afternoon and Sunday. Or, thirdly, the  annual close time for net and rod fishing might commence a month  earlier than at present; say net fishing to close on the 1st of  August, and rod fishing on the 1st of October. Any of these  measures would give the upper proprietors a much better supply of  fish than they now have. They all, I think, deserve consideration.  One thing at least is certain, that unless the upper proprietors  have a better share of the fish than they have at present, they  will soon cease to take an interest in their preservation.    To Colonel J. Wilson Patten, M.P.    * * * * *    LOW MOOR, _10th January_, 1865.    MY DEAR SIR,--I shall be very glad if I can induce you to read my  opinions on the Salmon question. It is one which I think may  become of even national importance, if properly managed. But the  sad tinkering it has hitherto received in the nine hundred and  ninety-nine Acts of Parliament wholly or partly devoted to the  subject makes me almost hopeless about future legislation. Yet it  seems to me that the only way to greatly increase the breed of  Salmon is so simple and obvious, that its not having been adopted  long since can only be accounted for by supposing that all the  parties interested in the matter are like the man in the fable,  who killed the goose that laid the golden eggs.    Hitherto the law has never properly recognized the claims of the  upper riparian proprietors. These men have all the trouble and  expense of rearing and protecting the young fish, whilst the  owners of estuary fisheries, men who never lift a hand nor spend a  penny in taking care of the brood, take above ninety per cent. of  the grown Salmon when in season; and even then think they are  hardly used. How can it be expected that the upper proprietors  should be very earnest in their protection of fish from which they  derive little or no benefit, merely acting the part of brood hens  and hatching the chickens for the benefit of other people?    In June, 1769, 3,384 Salmon and Salmon Trout were taken at a  single haul of the net in the Ribble, near Penwortham. Now the sea  is as wide, and, for anything we know to the contrary, as capable  of feeding them as it was a hundred years ago; and the rivers are  as capable of breeding and rearing them now as they were at that  time; and therefore I do not see why, if proper steps were taken,  they should not be as abundant now as they were then.    If we take a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1831"],[0,"The Lock and Key Library: Classic Mystery and Detective Stories: Old Time (#13)"],[1,"dge; there seemed some  marks of violence about his throat, but they were not deemed  sufficient to warrant the inquest in any other verdict that that of  \"found drowned.\"    The American and his wife took charge of the little boy, the  deceased brother having by his will left his sister the guardian of  his only child,--and in event of the child's death the sister  inherited.  The child died about six months afterwards,--it was  supposed to have been neglected and ill-treated.  The neighbors  deposed to have heard it shriek at night.  The surgeon who had  examined it after death said that it was emaciated as if from want  of nourishment, and the body was covered with livid bruises.  It  seemed that one winter night the child had sought to escape; crept  out into the back yard; tried to scale the wall; fallen back  exhausted; and been found at morning on the stones in a dying  state.  But though there was some evidence of cruelty, there was  none of murder; and the aunt and her husband had sought to palliate  cruelty by alleging the exceeding stubbornness and perversity of  the child, who was declared to be half-witted.  Be that as it may,  at the orphan's death the aunt inherited her brother's fortune.  Before the first wedded year was out, the American quitted England  abruptly, and never returned to it.  He obtained a cruising vessel,  which was lost in the Atlantic two years afterwards.  The widow was  left in affluence, but reverses of various kinds had befallen her:  a bank broke; an investment failed; she went into a small business  and became insolvent; then she entered into service, sinking lower  and lower, from housekeeper down to maid-of-all-work,--never long  retaining a place, though nothing decided against her character was  ever alleged.  She was considered sober, honest, and peculiarly  quiet in her ways; still nothing prospered with her.  And so she  had dropped into the workhouse, from which Mr. J---- had taken her,  to be placed in charge of the very house which she had rented as  mistress in the first year of her wedded life.    Mr. J---- added that he had passed an hour alone in the unfurnished  room which I had urged him to destroy, and that his impressions of  dread while there were so great, though he had neither heard nor  seen anything, that he was eager to have the walls bared and the  floors removed as I had suggested.  He had engaged persons for the  work, and would commence any day I would name.    The day was accordingly fixed.  I repaired to the haunted house,--  we went into the blind, dreary room, took up the skirting, and then  the floors.  Under the rafters, covered with rubbish, was found a  trapdoor, quite large enough to admit a man.  It was closely nailed  down, with clamps and rivets of iron.  On removing these we  descended into a room below, the existence of which had never been  suspected.  In this room there had been a window and a flue, but  they had been bricked over, evidently for many years.  By the help  of candles we examined this place; it still retained some moldering  furniture,--three chairs, an oak settle, a table,--all of the  fashion of about eighty years ago.  There was a chest of drawers  against the wall, in which we found, half rotted away, old-  fashioned articles of a man's dress, such as might have been worn  eighty or a hundred years ago by a gentleman of some rank; costly  steel buckles and buttons, like those yet worn in court dresses, a  handsome court sword; in a waistcoat which had once been rich with  gold lace, but which was now blackened and foul with damp, we found  five guineas, a few silver coins, and an ivory ticket, probably for  some place of entertainment long since passed away.  But our main  discovery was in a kind of iron safe fixed to the wall, the lock of  which it cost us much trouble to get picked.    In this safe were three shelves and two small drawers.  Ranged on  the shelves were several small bottles of crystal, hermetically  stopped.  They contained colorless, volatile essences, of the  nature of which I shall only say that they were not poisons,--  phosphor and ammonia entered into some of them.  There were also  some very curious glass tubes, and a small pointed rod of iron,  with a large lump of rock crystal, and another of amber,--also a  loadstone of great power.    In one of the drawers we found a miniature portrait set in gold,  and retaining the freshness of its colors most remarkably,  considering the length of time it had probably been there.  The  portrait was that of a man who might be somewhat advanced in middle  life, perhaps forty-seven or forty-eight.  It was a remarkable  face,--a most impressive face.  If you could fancy some mighty  serpent transformed into man, preserving in the human lineaments  the old serpent type, you would have a better idea of that  countenance than long descriptions can convey: the width and  flatness of frontal; the tapering elegance of contour disguising  the strength of the deadly jaw; the long, large, terrible eye,  glittering and green as the emerald,--and withal a certain ruthless  calm, as if from the consciousness of an immense power.    Mechanically I turned round the miniature to examine the back of  it, and on the back was engraved a pentacle; in the middle of the  pentacle a ladder, and the third step of the ladder was formed by  the date 1765.  Examining still more minutely, I detected a spring;  this, on being pressed, opened the back of the miniature as a lid.  Within-side the lid were engraved, \"Marianna to thee.  Be faithful  in life and in death to ----.\"  Here follows a name that I will not  mention, but it was not unfamiliar to me.  I had heard it spoken of  by old men in my childhood as the name borne by a dazzling  charlatan who had made a great sensation in London for a year or  so, and had fled the country on the charge of a double murder  within his own house,--that of his mistress and his rival.  I said  nothing of this to Mr. J----, to whom reluctantly I resigned the  miniature.    We had found no difficulty in opening the first drawer within the  iron safe; we found great difficulty in opening the second: it was  not locked, but it resisted all efforts, till we inserted in the  chinks the edge of a chisel.  When we had thus drawn it forth, we  found a very singular apparatus in the nicest order.  Upon a small,  thin book, or rather tablet, was placed a saucer of crystal; this  saucer was filled with a clear liquid,--on that liquid floated a  kind of compass, with a needle shifting rapidly round; but instead  of the usual points of a compass were seven strange characters, not  very unlike those used by astrologers to denote the planets.  A  peculiar but not strong nor displeasing odor came from this drawer,  which was lined with a wood that we afterwards discovered to be  hazel.  Whatever the cause of this odor, it produced a material  effect on the nerves.  We all felt it, even the two workmen who  were in the room,--a creeping, tingling sensation from the tips of  the fingers to the roots of the hair.  Impatient to examine the  tablet, I removed the saucer.  As I did so the needle of the  compass went round and round with exceeding swiftness, and I felt a  shock that ran through my whole frame, so that I dropped the saucer  on the floor.  The liquid was spilled; the saucer was broken; the  compass rolled to the end of the room, and at that instant the  walls shook to and fro, as if a giant had swayed and rocked them.    The two workmen were so frightened that they ran up the ladder by  which we had descended from the trapdoor; but seeing that nothing  more happened, they were easily induced to return.    Meanwhile I had opened the tablet: it was bound in plain red  leather, with a silver clasp; it contained but one sheet of thick  vellum, and on that sheet were inscribed, within a double pentacle,  words in old monkish Latin, which are literally to be translated  thus: \"On all that it can reach within these walls, sentient or  inanimate, living or dead, as moves the needle, so works my will!  Accursed be the house, and restless be the dwellers therein.\"    We found no more.  Mr. J---- burned the tablet and its anathema.  He razed to the foundations the part of the building containing the  secret room with the chamber over it.  He had then the courage to  inhabit the house himself for a month, and a quieter, better-  conditioned house could not be found in all London.  Subsequently  he let it to advantage, and his tenant has made no complaints.        A drowning man clutching at a straw--such is Dr. Fenwick, hero of  Bulwer-Lytton's \"Strange Story\" when he determines to lend himself  to alleged \"magic\" in the hope of saving his suffering wife from  the physical dangers which have succeeded her mental disease.  The  proposition has been made to him by Margrave, a wanderer in many  countries, who has followed the Fenwicks from England to Australia.  Margrave declares that he needs an accomplice to secure an \"elixir  of life\" which his own failing strength demands.  His mysterious  mesmeric or hypnotic influence over Mrs. Fenwick had in former days  been marked; and on the basis of this undeniable fact, he has  endeavored to show that his own welfare and Mrs. Fenwick's are, in  some occult fashion, knit together, and that only by aiding him in  some extraordinary experiment can the physician snatch his beloved  Lilian from her impending doom.    As the first chapter opens, Fenwick is learning his wife's  condition from his friend, Dr. Faber.        Bulwer-Lytton      The Incantation      I      \"I believe that for at least twelve hours there will be no change  in her state.  I believe also that if she recover from it, calm and  refreshed, as from a sleep, the danger of death will have passed  away.\"    \"And for twelve hours my presence would be hurtful?\"    \"Rather say fatal, if my diagnosis be right.\"    I wrung my friend's hand, and we parted.
