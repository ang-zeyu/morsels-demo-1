A little further  off--two or three hundred paces, perhaps--two more of the enemy's guns  had halted.    The English fell back some thirteen hundred yards, to the station on the  Dewetsdorp-Bloemfontein railway. I need scarcely say that we opened a  terrific fire on them as they retreated. When they reached the station,  however, the buildings there gave them considerable protection. I little  knew when I voted in the Volksraad for the construction of this line,  that I was voting for the building of a station which our enemies would  one day use against us.    An attempt was made by the English to save the five guns, but it was far  beyond their powers to do so. They did succeed, however, in getting the  other two guns away, and in placing them behind the station buildings.  From there they severely bombarded us with shrapnel shell.    While the English troops were running to find cover in the buildings,  they suffered very heavily from our fire, and the ground between the  station and the spruit was soon strewn with their dead and wounded,  lying in heaps. But having arrived at the railway they rallied, and  posting themselves to the right and left of the station, they fired  sharply on us.    The eleven hundred and fifty burghers who were to the east of the Modder  River now hurried up to my assistance. But unfortunately, when they  attempted to cross the river, they found that the Water-Works dam had  made it too deep to ford. So they proceeded up stream over some very  rough ground, being much inconvenienced by the dongas which they had to  cross. When they had covered three miles of this they were again  stopped, for an impassable donga blocked the way. They had therefore to  retrace their steps to the place whence they had started. Ultimately  they crossed the river below the dam, in the neighbourhood of the  waggon-drift.    This delay gave General Broadwood a good three hours in which to tackle  us. And had it not been for the excellent positions we had taken on the  banks of the spruit, we would have been in a very awkward predicament.  But, as it was, only two of my men were hit during the whole of that  time.    As soon as our reinforcements had crossed the river, General Broadwood  was forced to retire; and his troops came hurrying through Koorn Spruit  both on the right and on the left of our position. We fired at them as  they passed us, and took several more prisoners. Had I but commanded a  larger force, I could have captured every man of them. But it was  impossible, with my three hundred and fifty men, to surround two  thousand.    Our men on the Modder River now attacked the enemy with the greatest  energy, and succeeded in putting them to flight, thus bringing the  battle to an end.    The conduct of my burghers had been beyond praise. I had never seen  them more intrepid. Calm and determined, they stood their ground, when  the enemy streamed down upon them like a mighty river. Calm and  determined they awaited their arrival, and disarmed them as they came.  It was a fresh proof to me of the courage of the Afrikander, who indeed,  in my judgment, is in that quality surpassed by no one.    Our loss was three killed and five wounded. Among the latter was  Commandant General Van der Merve, who, although very seriously injured,  fortunately recovered. I had no time myself to note the enemy's losses,  but, from their own report, it amounted to three hundred and fifty dead  and wounded. We captured four hundred and eighty prisoners, seven guns,  and one hundred and seventeen waggons.    Here again I had the greatest trouble in unravelling the medley. Many of  the horses, mules and oxen had been killed, whilst some of the waggons  were broken. Everything was in a state of indescribable confusion, and  at any moment a force might arrive from Bloemfontein.    But, fortunately, no reinforcement appeared. Our burghers who had  pursued the retreating English, saw, at about twelve o'clock, a body of  mounted troops approaching from Bloemfontein. But this force at once  came to a halt, remaining at the spot where we had first seen it.[33]    When everything was over a party of troops from General Olivier's  commando arrived on the scene of the recent operations. They had been  following General Broadwood, and on hearing the firing that morning, had  hastened in our direction, maintaining on their arrival, that it was  quite impossible for them to have come any sooner.    [Footnote 31: Ford.]    [Footnote 32: Water-course or ravine.]    [Footnote 33: I may note here that it seemed very strange to me and to  all whose opinion I asked, that Lord Roberts, with his sixty thousand  men, sent no reinforcements from Bloemfontein. The battle had taken  place not more than seventeen miles from the capital, and it had lasted  for four hours; so that there had been ample time to send help. The  English cannot urge in excuse that, owing to our having cut the  telegraph wire, Lord Roberts could know nothing of General Broadwood's  position. The booming of the guns must have been distinctly heard at  Bloemfontein, as it was a still morning. In addition to this plain  warning, the English had an outpost at Borsmanskop, between Koorn Spruit  and Bloemfontein. I do not mention these things with the object of  throwing an unfavourable light upon Lord Roberts' conduct, but merely to  show that even in the great English Army, incomprehensible  irregularities were not unknown, and irregularities of such a character  as to quite put in the shade the bungles we were sometimes guilty of.  But the Republics, young though they were, never thought of boasting  about the order, organization, or discipline of their armies; on the  contrary they were perhaps a little inclined to take too lenient a view  when irregularities occurred.]          CHAPTER X    Four Hundred and Seventy English taken Prisoner at Reddersburg      In the evening of the day on which the events described in the last  chapter occurred, I handed over the command to Generals Piet de Wet and  A.P. Cronje, and taking with me three of my staff, rode to Donkerpoort,  in the direction of Dewetsdorp, on a reconnoitring expedition.    Early the following morning I came to a farm called Sterkfontein, where,  at noon, I received the news that a party of English, coming from  Smithfield, had occupied Dewetsdorp.    It was thirty miles from Sterkfontein to my commando, but,  notwithstanding this, I sent an order that 1,500 men, under Generals  J.B. Wessels, C.C. Froneman and De Villiers, should come up with all  haste and bring three guns with them.    During the time that must necessarily elapse before the arrival of this  force, I sent men out to visit the farms of those burghers who had gone  home after the fall of Bloemfontein, with orders to bring them back to  the front.    By the evening of the 1st of April I had all the men of the district  together; but it was then too late to make a start.    At ten o'clock the following morning the English left Dewetsdorp, and  marched towards Reddersburg. Directly I received news of this, I sent  word to the Generals, that they must hasten to Reddersburg; while I,  with the men who had rejoined, made my way to the north, so as to take  up a position on the enemy's flank. I had with me one hundred and ten  men in all. Many of them were without rifles, having given up their arms  at Bloemfontein. Others were provided with serviceable _achterlaaiers_,  but had little or no ammunition, because they had already fired off  their cartridges in mere wantonness in the belief that they might have  to give up their rifles any day. My handful of burghers were thus as  good as unarmed.    During our march I kept the English continually under surveillance. They  were unable to advance very rapidly, as the bulk of their force was made  up of infantry. But they were too far ahead for the commandos whom I had  sent in pursuit to be able to get at them; and for me, with the handful  of almost unarmed burghers which I commanded, to have attempted an  attack would have been worse than folly.    On the evening of the 2nd of April, the English encamped on the hill to  the west of a farm called Oollogspoort; whilst we off-saddled to the  north of them, on Mr. Van der Walt's farm. The enemy, however, was not  aware of the position of our laager.    The following morning, at four o'clock, I sent a third report to the  commandos. They had been some way on the road to Dewetsdorp, and thus,  far out of the course to Reddersburg, when my second report reached  them; and now my despatch rider met only Generals Froneman and De  Villiers with seven hundred men and three guns, and was too late to  prevent General Wessels from going on to Dewetsdorp.    Shortly after sunrise General Froneman received my report. He had been  riding all night through without stopping, and many of his horses were  already tired out. But as my order was that the Generals were to leave  behind those who were unable to proceed, and to hasten on at once  without so much as off-saddling, he did not wait to be told twice, but  pushing forward with all speed, arrived on the 3rd of April at  Schwarskopjes on the Kaffir River. He had left Sanna's Post on the  afternoon of the previous day.    Those who consider that he was marching with seven hundred men and three  Krupp guns, and that his horses were so exhausted that some of them had  to be left behind, will agree with me that he did a good day's work in  those twenty-four hours.    Fortunately for us, it was not at that time the habit of the English to  start on their march before the sun had risen. And, by another lucky  chance, our opponents were off their guard, and quite unsuspicious of  attack, although they must, undoubtedly, have heard something of what  had happened at Sanna's Post.    General Froneman gave me to understand that it was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1881"],[0,"The Call of the Canyon (#13)"],[1,"  This direction sounded in Glenn's cheery voice a good deal more  pleasurable than the possibilities suggested. Surely that cedar tree  could not keep off rain or snow.    \"Glenn, how about--about animals--and crawling things, you know?\"  queried Carley.    \"Oh, there are a few tarantulas and centipedes, and sometimes a  scorpion. But these don't crawl around much at night. The only thing to  worry about are the hydrophobia skunks.\"    \"What on earth are they?\" asked Carley, quite aghast.    \"Skunks are polecats, you know,\" replied Glenn, cheerfully. \"Sometimes  one gets bitten by a coyote that has rabies, and then he's a dangerous  customer. He has no fear and he may run across you and bite you in the  face. Queer how they generally bite your nose. Two men have been bitten  since I've been here. One of them died, and the other had to go to the  Pasteur Institute with a well-developed case of hydrophobia.\"    \"Good heavens!\" cried Carley, horrified.    \"You needn't be afraid,\" said Glenn. \"I'll tie one of the dogs near your  bed.\"    Carley wondered whether Glenn's casual, easy tone had been adopted for  her benefit or was merely an assimilation from this Western life. Not  improbably Glenn himself might be capable of playing a trick on her.  Carley endeavored to fortify herself against disaster, so that when it  befell she might not be wholly ludicrous.    With the coming of twilight a cold, keen wind moaned through the cedars.  Carley would have hovered close to the fire even if she had not been  too tired to exert herself. Despite her aches, she did justice to  the supper. It amazed her that appetite consumed her to the extent of  overcoming a distaste for this strong, coarse cooking. Before the meal  ended darkness had fallen, a windy raw darkness that enveloped heavily  like a blanket. Presently Carley edged closer to the fire, and there  she stayed, alternately turning back and front to the welcome heat. She  seemingly roasted hands, face, and knees while her back froze. The wind  blew the smoke in all directions. When she groped around with blurred,  smarting eyes to escape the hot smoke, it followed her. The other  members of the party sat comfortably on sacks or rocks, without much  notice of the smoke that so exasperated Carley. Twice Glenn insisted  that she take a seat he had fixed for her, but she preferred to stand  and move around a little.    By and by the camp tasks of the men appeared to be ended, and all  gathered near the fire to lounge and smoke and talk. Glenn and Hutter  engaged in interested conversation with two Mexicans, evidently sheep  herders. If the wind and cold had not made Carley so uncomfortable she  might have found the scene picturesque. How black the night! She could  scarcely distinguish the sky at all. The cedar branches swished in  the wind, and from the gloom came a low sound of waves lapping a rocky  shore. Presently Glenn held up a hand.    \"Listen, Carley!\" he said.    Then she heard strange wild yelps, staccato, piercing, somehow  infinitely lonely. They made her shudder.    \"Coyotes,\" said Glenn. \"You'll come to love that chorus. Hear the dogs  bark back.\"    Carley listened with interest, but she was inclined to doubt that she  would ever become enamoured of such wild cries.    \"Do coyotes come near camp?\" she queried.    \"Shore. Sometimes they pull your pillow out from under your head,\"  replied Flo, laconically.    Carley did not ask any more questions. Natural history was not her  favorite study and she was sure she could dispense with any first-hand  knowledge of desert beasts. She thought, however, she heard one of  the men say, \"Big varmint prowlin' round the sheep.\" To which Hutter  replied, \"Reckon it was a bear.\" And Glenn said, \"I saw his fresh track  by the lake. Some bear!\"    The heat from the fire made Carley so drowsy that she could scarcely  hold up her head. She longed for bed even if it was out there in the  open. Presently Flo called her: \"Come. Let's walk a little before  turning in.\"    So Carley permitted herself to be led to and fro down an open aisle  between some cedars. The far end of that aisle, dark, gloomy, with the  bushy secretive cedars all around, caused Carley apprehension she was  ashamed to admit. Flo talked eloquently about the joys of camp life, and  how the harder any outdoor task was and the more endurance and pain it  required, the more pride and pleasure one had in remembering it. Carley  was weighing the import of these words when suddenly Flo clutched her  arm. \"What's that?\" she whispered, tensely.    Carley stood stockstill. They had reached the furthermost end of that  aisle, but had turned to go back. The flare of the camp fire threw a wan  light into the shadows before them. There came a rustling in the brush,  a snapping of twigs. Cold tremors chased up and down Carley's back.    \"Shore it's a varmint, all right. Let's hurry,\" whispered Flo.    Carley needed no urging. It appeared that Flo was not going to run. She  walked fast, peering back over her shoulder, and, hanging to Carley's  arm, she rounded a large cedar that had obstructed some of the  firelight. The gloom was not so thick here. And on the instant Carley  espied a low, moving object, somehow furry, and gray in color. She  gasped. She could not speak. Her heart gave a mighty throb and seemed to  stop.    \"What--do you see?\" cried Flo, sharply, peering ahead. \"Oh!... Come,  Carley. Run!\"    Flo's cry showed she must nearly be strangled with terror. But Carley  was frozen in her tracks. Her eyes were riveted upon the gray furry  object. It stopped. Then it came faster. It magnified. It was a huge  beast. Carley had no control over mind, heart, voice, or muscle. Her  legs gave way. She was sinking. A terrible panic, icy, sickening,  rending, possessed her whole body.    The huge gray thing came at her. Into the rushing of her ears broke  thudding sounds. The thing leaped up. A horrible petrifaction suddenly  made stone of Carley. Then she saw a gray mantlelike object cast aside  to disclose the dark form of a man. Glenn!    \"Carley, dog-gone it! You don't scare worth a cent,\" he laughingly  complained.    She collapsed into his arms. The liberating shock was as great as had  been her terror. She began to tremble violently. Her hands got back a  sense of strength to clutch. Heart and blood seemed released from that  ice-banded vise.    \"Say, I believe you were scared,\" went on Glenn, bending over her.    \"Scar-ed!\" she gasped. \"Oh--there's no word--to tell--what I was!\"    Flo came running back, giggling with joy. \"Glenn, she shore took you for  a bear. Why, I felt her go stiff as a post!... Ha! Ha! Ha! Carley, now  how do you like the wild and woolly?\"    \"Oh! You put up a trick on me!\" ejaculated Carley. \"Glenn, how could  you? ... Such a terrible trick! I wouldn't have minded something  reasonable. But that! Oh, I'll never forgive you!\"    Glenn showed remorse, and kissed her before Flo in a way that made some  little amends. \"Maybe I overdid it,\" he said. \"But I thought you'd have  a momentary start, you know, enough to make you yell, and then you'd  see through it. I only had a sheepskin over my shoulders as I crawled on  hands and knees.\"    \"Glenn, for me you were a prehistoric monster--a dinosaur, or  something,\" replied Carley.    It developed, upon their return to the campfire circle, that everybody  had been in the joke; and they all derived hearty enjoyment from it.    \"Reckon that makes you one of us,\" said Hutter, genially. \"We've all had  our scares.\"    Carley wondered if she were not so constituted that such trickery  alienated her. Deep in her heart she resented being made to show  her cowardice. But then she realized that no one had really seen any  evidence of her state. It was fun to them.    Soon after this incident Hutter sounded what he called the roll-call for  bed. Following Flo's instructions, Carley sat on their bed, pulled off  her boots, folded coat and sweater at her head, and slid down under the  blankets. How strange and hard a bed! Yet Carley had the most delicious  sense of relief and rest she had ever experienced. She straightened out  on her back with a feeling that she had never before appreciated the  luxury of lying down.    Flo cuddled up to her in quite sisterly fashion, saying: \"Now don't  cover your head. If it rains I'll wake and pull up the tarp. Good night,  Carley.\" And almost immediately she seemed to fall asleep.    For Carley, however, sleep did not soon come. She had too many aches;  the aftermath of her shock of fright abided with her; and the blackness  of night, the cold whip of wind over her face, and the unprotected  helplessness she felt in this novel bed, were too entirely new and  disturbing to be overcome at once. So she lay wide eyed, staring at the  dense gray shadow, at the flickering lights upon the cedar. At length  her mind formed a conclusion that this sort of thing might be worth the  hardship once in a lifetime, anyway. What a concession to Glenn's West!  In the secret seclusion of her mind she had to confess that if her  vanity had not been so assaulted and humiliated she might have enjoyed  herself more. It seemed impossible, however, to have thrills and  pleasures and exaltations in the face of discomfort, privation, and an  uneasy half-acknowledged fear. No woman could have either a good or a  profitable time when she was at her worst. Carley thought she would not  be averse to getting Flo Hutter to New York, into an atmosphere wholly  strange and difficult, and see how she met situation after situation  unfamiliar to her. And so Carley's mind drifted on until at last she  succumbed to drowsiness.      A voice pierced her dreams of home, of warmth and comfort. Something  sharp, cold, and fragrant was scratching her eyes. She opened them.  Glenn stood over her, pushing a sprig of cedar into her face.    \"Carley, the day is far spent,\" he said, gayly. \"We want to roll up your"]]]
