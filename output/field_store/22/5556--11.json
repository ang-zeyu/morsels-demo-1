Hope you are peckish too; what shall I give you? tea or  coffee?--but take both--coffee first and tea after a bit. If I can't  give you them good, don't know who can. You must pay your devours, as we  say in France, to the 'am, for it is an especial fine one, and do take  a few eggs with it; there, I've not given you above a pound of 'am, but  you can come again, you know--waste not want not. Now take some muffins,  do, pray. Batsey, bring some more cream, and set the kidneys on the  table, the Yorkshireman is getting nothing to eat. Have a chop with  your kidney, werry luxterous--I could eat an elephant stuffed with  grenadiers, and wash them down with a ocean of tea; but pray lay in to  the breakfast, or I shall think you don't like it. There, now take some  tea and toast or one of those biscuits, or whatever you like; would a  little more 'am be agreeable? Batsey, run into the larder and see if  your Missis left any of that cold chine of pork last night--and hear,  bring the cold goose, and any cold flesh you can lay hands on, there are  really no wittles on the table. I am quite ashamed to set you down to  such a scanty fork breakfast; but this is what comes of not being master  of your own house. Hope your hat may long cover your family: rely  upon it, it is cheaper to buy your bacon than to keep a pig\". Just as  Jorrocks uttered these last words the side door opened, and without  either \"with your leave or by your leave\", in bounced Mrs. Jorrocks in  an elegant dishabille (or \"dish-of-veal\", as Jorrocks pronounced it),  with her hair tucked up in papers, and a pair of worsted slippers on her  feet, worked with roses and blue lilies.    \"Pray, Mister J----,\" said she, taking no more notice of the  Yorkshireman than if he had been enveloped in Jack the Giant-killer's  coat of darkness, \"what is the meaning of this card? I found it in your  best coat pocket, which you had on last night, and I do desire, sir,  that you will tell me how it came there. Good morning, sir (spying the  Yorkshireman at last), perhaps you know where Mr. Jorrocks was last  night, and perhaps you can tell me who this person is whose card I  have found in the corner of Mr. Jorrocks's best coat pocket?\" \"Indeed,  madam\", replied the Yorkshireman, \"Mr. Jorrocks's movements of yesterday  evening are quite a secret to me. It is the night that he usually spends  at the Magpie and Stump, but whether he was there or not I cannot  pretend to say, not being a member of the free and easy club. As for the  card, madam...\" \"There, then, take it and read it,\" interrupted Mrs.  J----; and he took the card accordingly--a delicate pale pink, with blue  borders and gilt edge--and read--we would fain put it all in dashes and  asterisks--\"Miss Juliana Granville, John Street, Waterloo Road.\"    This digression giving Mr. Jorrocks a moment or two to recollect  himself, he pretended to get into a thundering passion, and seizing  the card out of the Yorkshireman's hand, he thrust it into the fire,  swearing it was an application for admission into the Deaf and Dumb  Institution, where he wished he had Mrs. J----. The Yorkshireman, seeing  the probability of a breeze, pretended to have forgotten something  at the Piazza, and stole away, begging Jorrocks to pick him up as he  passed. Peace had soon been restored; for the Yorkshireman had not taken  above three or four turns up and down the coffee-room, ere George the  waiter came to say that a gentleman waited outside. Putting on his hat  and taking a coat over his arm, he turned out; when just before the door  he saw a man muffled up in a great military cloak, and a glazed hat,  endeavouring to back a nondescript double-bodied carriage (with lofty  mail box-seats and red wheels), close to the pavement. \"Who-ay, who-ay,\"  said he, \"who-ay, who-ay, horse!\" at the same time jerking at his mouth.  As the Yorkshireman made his exit, a pair eyes of gleamed through the  small aperture between the high cloak collar and the flipe of the glazed  hat, which he instantly recognised to belong to Jorrocks. \"Why, what the  deuce is this you are in?\" said he, looking at the vehicle. \"Jump up,\"  said Jorrocks, \"and I'll tell you all about it,\" which having done, and  the machine being set in motion he proceeded to relate the manner in  which he had exchanged his cruelty-van for it--by the way, as arrant  a bone-setter as ever unfortunate got into, but which he, with the  predilection all men have for their own, pronounced to be a \"monstrous  nice carriage.\" On their turning off the rough pavement on to the quiet  smooth Macadamised road leading to Waterloo Bridge, his dissertation was  interrupted by a loud horse-laugh raised by two or three toll-takers and  boys lounging about the gate.    \"I say, Tom, twig this 'ere machine,\" said one. \"Dash my buttons, I  never seed such a thing in all my life.\" \"What's to pay?\" inquired  Jorrocks, pulling up with great dignity, their observations not having  penetrated the cloak collar which encircled his ears. \"To pay!\" said the  toll-taker--\"vy, vot do ye call your consarn?\" \"Why, a phaeton,\" said  Jorrocks. \"My eyes! that's a good 'un,\" said another. \"I say, Jim--he  calls this 'ere thing a phe-a-ton!\" \"A phe-a-ton!--vy, it's more like a  fire-engine,\" said Jim. \"Don't be impertinent,\" said Jorrocks, who had  pulled down his collar to hear what he had to pay--\"but tell me what's  to pay?\" \"Vy, it's a phe-a-ton drawn by von or more 'orses,\" said  the toll-taker; \"and containing von or more asses,\" said Tom.  \"Sixpence-halfpenny, sir,\" \"You are a saucy fellow,\" said Jorrocks.  \"Thank ye, master, you're another,\" said the toll-taker; \"and now that  you have had your say, vot do ye ax for your mouth?\" \"I say, sir, do you  belong to the Phenix? Vy don't you show your badge?\" \"I say, Tom, that  'ere fire-engine has been painted by some house-painter, it's never been  in the hands of no coach-maker. Do you shave by that 'ere glazed castor  of yours?\" \"I'm blowed it I wouldn't get you a shilling a week to  shove your face in sand, to make moulds for brass knockers.\" \"Ay, get  away!--make haste, or the fire will be out,\" bawled out another, as  Jorrocks whipped on, and rattled out of hearing.    \"Now, you see,\" said he, resuming the thread of his discourse, as if  nothing had happened, \"this back seat turns down and makes a box, so  that when Mrs. J---- goes to her mother's at Tooting, she can take all  her things with her, instead of sending half of them by the coach as she  used to do; and if we are heavy, there is a pole belonging to it, so  that we can have two horses; and then there is a seat draws out here  (pulling a stool from between his legs) which anybody can sit on.\" \"Yes,  anybody that is small enough,\" said the Yorkshireman, \"but you would cut  a queer figure on it, I reckon.\" The truth was, that the \"fire-engine\"  was one of those useless affairs built by some fool upon a plan of his  own, with the idea of combining every possible comfort and advantage,  and in reality not possessing one. Friend Jorrocks had seen it at a  second-hand shop in Fore Street, and became the happy owner of it, in  exchange for the cruelty-van and seventeen pounds.--Their appearance on  the road created no small sensation, and many were the jokes passed upon  the \"fire-engine.\" One said they were mountebanks; another that it was  a horse-break; a third asked if it was one of Gurney's steam-carriages,  while a fourth swore it was a new convict-cart going to Brixton.  Jorrocks either did not or would not hear their remarks, and kept  expatiating upon the different purposes to which the machine might be  converted, and the stoutness of the horse that was drawing it.    As they approached the town of Croydon, he turned his cloak over his  legs in a very workman-like manner, and was instantly hailed by some  brother sportsmen;--one complimented him on his looks, another on his  breeches, a third praised his horse, a fourth abused the fire-engine,  and a fifth inquired where he got his glazed hat. He had an answer for  them all, and a nod or a wink for every pretty maid that showed at the  windows; for though past the grand climacteric, he still has a spice of  the devil in him--and, as he says, \"there is no harm in looking.\" The  \"Red Lion\" at Smitham Bottom was the rendezvous of the day. It is a  small inn on the Brighton road, some three or four miles below Croydon.  On the left of the road stands the inn, on the right is a small  training-ground, and the country about is open common and down. There  was an immense muster about the inn, and also on the training-ground,  consisting of horsemen, gig-men, post-chaise-men, footmen,--Jorrocks and  the Yorkshireman made the firemen.    \"Here's old Jorrocks, I do declare\", exclaimed one, as Jorrocks drove  the fire-engine up at as quick a pace as his horse would go. \"Why,  what a concern he's in\", said another, \"why, the old man's mad,  surely\".--\"He's good for a subscription,\" added another, addressing him.  \"I say, Jorrocks, old boy, you'll give us ten pound for our hounds  won't you?--that's a good fellow.\" \"Oh yes, Jorrocks promised us a  subscription last year,\" observed another, \"and he is a man of his  word--arn't you old leather breeches?\" \"No, gentlemen,\" said Jorrocks,  standing up in the fire-engine, and sticking the whip into its nest,  \"I really cannot--I wish I could, but I really cannot afford it.

From the various scenes I had beheld  on shipboard, I soon grew a stranger to terror of every kind, and was,  in that respect at least, almost an Englishman. I have often reflected  with surprise that I never felt half the alarm at any of the numerous  dangers I have been in, that I was filled with at the first sight of  the Europeans, and at every act of theirs, even the most trifling,  when I first came among them, and for some time afterwards. That fear,  however, which was the effect of my ignorance, wore away as I began to  know them. I could now speak English tolerably well, and I perfectly  understood every thing that was said. I now not only felt myself  quite easy with these new countrymen, but relished their society and  manners. I no longer looked upon them as spirits, but as men superior  to us; and therefore I had the stronger desire to resemble them; to  imbibe their spirit, and imitate their manners; I therefore embraced  every occasion of improvement; and every new thing that I observed I  treasured up in my memory. I had long wished to be able to read and  write; and for this purpose I took every opportunity to gain  instruction, but had made as yet very little progress. However, when I  went to London with my master, I had soon an opportunity of improving  myself, which I gladly embraced. Shortly after my arrival, he sent me  to wait upon the Miss Guerins, who had treated me with much kindness  when I was there before; and they sent me to school.    While I was attending these ladies their servants told me I could not  go to Heaven unless I was baptized. This made me very uneasy; for I  had now some faint idea of a future state: accordingly I communicated  my anxiety to the eldest Miss Guerin, with whom I was become a  favourite, and pressed her to have me baptized; when to my great joy  she told me I should. She had formerly asked my master to let me be  baptized, but he had refused; however she now insisted on it; and he  being under some obligation to her brother complied with her request;  so I was baptized in St. Margaret's church, Westminster, in February  1759, by my present name. The clergyman, at the same time, gave me a  book, called a Guide to the Indians, written by the Bishop of Sodor  and Man. On this occasion Miss Guerin did me the honour to stand as  godmother, and afterwards gave me a treat. I used to attend these  ladies about the town, in which service I was extremely happy; as I  had thus many opportunities of seeing London, which I desired of all  things. I was sometimes, however, with my master at his  rendezvous-house, which was at the foot of Westminster-bridge. Here I  used to enjoy myself in playing about the bridge stairs, and often in  the watermen's wherries, with other boys. On one of these occasions  there was another boy with me in a wherry, and we went out into the  current of the river: while we were there two more stout boys came to  us in another wherry, and, abusing us for taking the boat, desired me  to get into the other wherry-boat. Accordingly I went to get out of  the wherry I was in; but just as I had got one of my feet into the  other boat the boys shoved it off, so that I fell into the Thames;  and, not being able to swim, I should unavoidably have been drowned,  but for the assistance of some watermen who providentially came to my  relief.    The Namur being again got ready for sea, my master, with his gang, was  ordered on board; and, to my no small grief, I was obliged to leave my  school-master, whom I liked very much, and always attended while I  stayed in London, to repair on board with my master. Nor did I leave  my kind patronesses, the Miss Guerins, without uneasiness and regret.  They often used to teach me to read, and took great pains to instruct  me in the principles of religion and the knowledge of God. I therefore  parted from those amiable ladies with reluctance; after receiving from  them many friendly cautions how to conduct myself, and some valuable  presents.    When I came to Spithead, I found we were destined for the  Mediterranean, with a large fleet, which was now ready to put to sea.  We only waited for the arrival of the admiral, who soon came on board;  and about the beginning of the spring 1759, having weighed anchor, and  got under way, Sailed for the Mediterranean; and in eleven days, from  the Land's End, we got to Gibraltar. While we were here I used to be  often on shore, and got various fruits in great plenty, and very  cheap.    I had frequently told several people, in my excursions on shore, the  story of my being kidnapped with my sister, and of our being  separated, as I have related before; and I had as often expressed my  anxiety for her fate, and my sorrow at having never met her again. One  day, when I was on shore, and mentioning these circumstances to some  persons, one of them told me he knew where my sister was, and, if I  would accompany him, he would bring me to her. Improbable as this  story was I believed it immediately, and agreed to go with him, while  my heart leaped for joy: and, indeed, he conducted me to a black young  woman, who was so like my sister, that, at first sight, I really  thought it was her: but I was quickly undeceived; and, on talking to  her, I found her to be of another nation.    While we lay here the Preston came in from the Levant. As soon as she  arrived, my master told me I should now see my old companion, Dick,  who had gone in her when she sailed for Turkey. I was much rejoiced at  this news, and expected every minute to embrace him; and when the  captain came on board of our ship, which he did immediately after, I  ran to inquire after my friend; but, with inexpressible sorrow, I  learned from the boat's crew that the dear youth was dead! and that  they had brought his chest, and all his other things, to my master:  these he afterwards gave to me, and I regarded them as a memorial of  my friend, whom I loved, and grieved for, as a brother.    While we were at Gibraltar, I saw a soldier hanging by his heels, at  one of the moles[L]: I thought this a strange sight, as I had seen a  man hanged in London by his neck. At another time I saw the master of  a frigate towed to shore on a grating, by several of the men of war's  boats, and discharged the fleet, which I understood was a mark of  disgrace for cowardice. On board the same ship there was also a sailor  hung up at the yard-arm.    After lying at Gibraltar for some time, we sailed up the Mediterranean  a considerable way above the Gulf of Lyons; where we were one night  overtaken with a terrible gale of wind, much greater than any I had  ever yet experienced. The sea ran so high that, though all the guns  were well housed, there was great reason to fear their getting loose,  the ship rolled so much; and if they had it must have proved our  destruction. After we had cruised here for a short time, we came to  Barcelona, a Spanish sea-port, remarkable for its silk manufactures.  Here the ships were all to be watered; and my master, who spoke  different languages, and used often to interpret for the admiral,  superintended the watering of ours. For that purpose he and the  officers of the other ships, who were on the same service, had tents  pitched in the bay; and the Spanish soldiers were stationed along the  shore, I suppose to see that no depredations were committed by our  men.    I used constantly to attend my master; and I was charmed with this  place. All the time we stayed it was like a fair with the natives, who  brought us fruits of all kinds, and sold them to us much cheaper than  I got them in England. They used also to bring wine down to us in hog  and sheep skins, which diverted me very much. The Spanish officers  here treated our officers with great politeness and attention; and  some of them, in particular, used to come often to my master's tent to  visit him; where they would sometimes divert themselves by mounting me  on the horses or mules, so that I could not fall, and setting them off  at full gallop; my imperfect skill in horsemanship all the while  affording them no small entertainment. After the ships were watered,  we returned to our old station of cruizing off Toulon, for the purpose  of intercepting a fleet of French men of war that lay there. One  Sunday, in our cruise, we came off a place where there were two small  French frigates lying in shore; and our admiral, thinking to take or  destroy them, sent two ships in after them--the Culloden and the  Conqueror. They soon came up to the Frenchmen; and I saw a smart fight  here, both by sea and land: for the frigates were covered by  batteries, and they played upon our ships most furiously, which they  as furiously returned, and for a long time a constant firing was kept  up on all sides at an amazing rate. At last one frigate sunk; but the  people escaped, though not without much difficulty: and a little after  some of the people left the other frigate also, which was a mere  wreck. However, our ships did not venture to bring her away, they were  so much annoyed from the batteries, which raked them both in going and  coming: their topmasts were shot away, and they were otherwise so much  shattered, that the admiral was obliged to send in many boats to tow  them back to the fleet. I afterwards sailed with a man who fought in  one of the French batteries during the engagement, and he told me our  ships had done considerable mischief that day on shore and in the  batteries.    After this we sailed for Gibraltar, and arrived there about August  1759. Here we remained with all our sails unbent, while the fleet was  watering and"]]]
