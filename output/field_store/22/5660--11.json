There is nothing more  cheery and jocund than the flourishes of the horns, but also nothing  more mild and soothing than the songs which sometimes they sing. There  is nothing more solemn and religious than the harmony of the  trombones, while \"the trumpet's loud clangor\" is the very voice of a  war-like spirit. All of these instruments have undergone important  changes within the last few score years. The classical composers,  almost down to our own time, were restricted in the use of them  because they were merely natural tubes, and their notes were limited  to the notes which inflexible tubes can produce. Within this century,  however, they have all been transformed from imperfect diatonic  instruments to perfect chromatic instruments; that is to say, every  brass instrument which is in use now can give out all the semitones  within its compass. This has been accomplished through the agency of  valves, by means of which differing lengths of the sonorous tube are  brought within the command of the players. In the case of the  trombones an exceedingly venerable means of accomplishing the same end  is applied. The tube is in part made double, one part sliding over the  other. By moving his arm, the player lengthens or shortens the tube,  and thus changing the key of the instrument, acquires all the tones  which can be obtained from so many tubes of different lengths. The  mouth-pieces of the trumpet, trombone, and tuba are cup-shaped, and  larger than the mouth-piece of the horn, which is little else than a  flare of the slender tube, sufficiently wide to receive enough of the  player's lips to form the embouchure, or human reed, as it might here  be named.    [Sidenote: _The French horn._]    [Sidenote: _Manipulation of the French horn._]    The French horn (Plate IX.), as it is called in the orchestra, is the  sweetest and mellowest of all the wind instruments. In Beethoven's  time it was but little else than the old hunting-horn, which, for the  convenience of the mounted hunter, was arranged in spiral  convolutions that it might be slipped over the head and carried  resting on one shoulder and under the opposite arm. The Germans still  call it the _Waldhorn_, _i.e._, \"forest horn;\" the old French name was  _cor de chasse_, the Italian _corno di caccia_. In this instrument  formerly the tones which were not the natural resonances of the  harmonic division of the tube were helped out by partly closing the  bell with the right hand, it having been discovered accidentally that  by putting the hand into the lower end of the tube--the flaring part  called the bell--the pitch of a tone was raised. Players still make  use of this method for convenience, and sometimes because a composer  wishes to employ the slightly muffled effect of these tones; but since  valves have been added to the instrument, it is possible to play a  chromatic scale in what are called the unstopped or open tones.    [Sidenote: _Kinds of horns._]    [Sidenote: _The trumpet._]    [Sidenote: _The cornet._]    Formerly it was necessary to use horns of different pitch, and  composers still respect this tradition, and designate the key of the  horns which they wish to have employed; but so skilful have the  players become that, as a rule, they use horns whose fundamental tone  is F for all keys, and achieve the old purpose by simply transposing  the music as they read it. If these most graceful instruments were  straightened out they would be seventeen feet long. The convolutions  of the horn and the many turns of the trumpet are all the fruit of  necessity; they could not be manipulated to produce the tones that are  asked of them if they were not bent and curved. The trumpet, when its  tube is lengthened by the addition of crooks for its lowest key, is  eight feet long; the tuba, sixteen. In most orchestras (in all of  those in the United States, in fact, except the Boston and Chicago  Orchestras and the Symphony Society of New York) the word trumpet is  merely a euphemism for cornet, the familiar leading instrument of the  brass band, which, while it falls short of the trumpet in the quality  of its tone, in the upper registers especially, is a more easily  manipulated instrument than the trumpet, and is preferable in the  lower tones.    [Sidenote: _The trombone._]    Mendelssohn is quoted as saying that the trombones (Plate X.) \"are too  sacred to use often.\" They have, indeed, a majesty and nobility all  their own, and the lowest use to which they can be put is to furnish a  flaring and noisy harmony in an orchestral _tutti_. They are  marvellously expressive instruments, and without a peer in the whole  instrumental company when a solemn and spiritually uplifting effect is  to be attained. They can also be made to sound menacing and  lugubrious, devout and mocking, pompously heroic, majestic, and lofty.  They are often the heralds of the orchestra, and make sonorous  proclamations.    [Sidenote: _Trombone effects._]    [Sidenote: _The tuba._]    The classic composers always seemed to approach the trombones with  marked respect, but nowadays it requires a very big blue pencil in the  hands of a very uncompromising conservatory professor to prevent a  student engaged on his _Opus 1_ from keeping his trombones going half  the time at least. It is an old story how Mozart keeps the instruments  silent through three-fourths of his immortal \"Don Giovanni,\" so that  they may enter with overwhelming impressiveness along with the  ghostly visitor of the concluding scene. As a rule, there are three  trombones in the modern orchestra--two tenors and a bass. Formerly  there were four kinds, bearing the names of the voices to which they  were supposed to be nearest in tone-quality and compass--soprano,  alto, tenor, and bass. Full four-part harmony is now performed by the  three trombones and the tuba (Plate XI.). The latter instrument,  which, despite its gigantic size, is exceedingly tractable can \"roar  you as gently as any sucking dove.\" Far-away and strangely mysterious  tones are got out of the brass instruments, chiefly the cornet and  horn, by almost wholly closing the bell.    [Sidenote: _Instruments of percussion._]    [Sidenote: _The xylophone._]    [Sidenote: _Kettle-drums._]    [Sidenote: _Pfund's tuning device._]    [Sidenote: _Pitch of the drums._]    [Sidenote: _Qualifications of a drummer._]    The percussion apparatus of the modern orchestra includes a multitude  of instruments scarcely deserving of description. Several varieties of  drums, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, steel bars (_Glockenspiel_),  gongs, bells, and many other things which we are now inclined to look  upon as toys, rather than as musical instruments, are brought into  play for reasons more or less fantastic. Saint-Saens has even utilized  the barbarous xylophone, whose proper place is the variety hall, in  his \"Danse Macabre.\" There his purpose was a fantastic one, and the  effect is capital. The pictorial conceit at the bottom of the poem  which the music illustrates is Death, as a skeleton, seated on a  tombstone, playing the viol, and gleefully cracking his bony heels  against the marble. To produce this effect, the composer uses the  xylophone with capital results. But of all the ordinary instruments of  percussion, the only one that is really musical and deserving of  comment is the kettle-drum. This instrument is more musical than the  others because it has pitch. Its voice is not mere noise, but musical  noise. Kettle-drums, or tympani, are generally used in pairs, though  the vast multiplication of effects by modern composers has resulted  also in the extension of this department of the band. It is seldom  that more than two pairs are used, a good player with a quick ear  being able to accomplish all that Wagner asks of six drums by his  deftness in changing the pitch of the instruments. This work of tuning  is still performed generally in what seems a rudimentary way, though a  German drum-builder named Pfund invented a contrivance by which the  player, by simply pressing on a balanced pedal and watching an  indicator affixed to the side of the drums, can change the pitch to  any desired semitone within the range of an octave.    The tympani are hemispherical brass or copper vessels, kettles in  short, covered with vellum heads. The pitch of the instrument depends  on the tension of the head, which is applied generally by key-screws  working through the iron ring which holds the vellum. There is a  difference in the size of the drums to place at the command of the  player the octave from F in the first space below the bass staff to F  on the fourth line of the same staff. Formerly the purpose of the  drums was simply to give emphasis, and they were then uniformly tuned  to the key-note and fifth of the key in which a composition was set.  Now they are tuned in many ways, not only to allow for the frequent  change of keys, but also so that they may be used as harmony  instruments. Berlioz did more to develop the drums than any composer  who has ever lived, though Beethoven already manifested appreciation  of their independent musical value. In the last movement of his Eighth  Symphony and the scherzo of his Ninth, he tunes them in octaves, his  purpose in the latter case being to give the opening figure, an octave  leap, of the scherzo melody to the drums solo. The most extravagant  use ever made of the drums, however, was by Berlioz in his \"Messe des  Morts,\" where he called in eight pairs of drums and ten players to  help him to paint his tonal picture of the terrors of the last  judgment. The post of drummer is one of the most difficult to fill in  a symphonic orchestra. He is required to have not only a perfect sense  of time and rhythm, but also a keen sense of pitch, for often the  composer asks him to change the pitch of one or both of his drums in  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17478"],[0,"Great Pictures, As Seen and Described (#13)"],[1,"d, and a white. These four tones are placed side by side as frankly as  is possible with four notes of such violence. The contact is brusque and  yet they do not suffer. In the great white, the corpse of Christ is  drawn with a delicate and supple line and modelled by its own reliefs  without any effort of _nuances_, thanks to deviations of imperceptible  values. No shining, no single division in the lights, and scarcely a  detail in the dark parts. All that is of a singular breadth and  rigidity. The outlines are narrow, the half-tints limited except in the  Christ, where the under layer of ultramarine has worn through and to-day  forms blemishes. The pigment is smooth, compact, flowing easily and  thoughtfully.    At the distance from which we examine it, the work of the hand  disappears, but it is easy to guess that it is excellent and directed  with full confidence by a mind broken into good habits, that conforms to  them, applies itself, and wishes to do well. Rubens remembers, observes,  restrains himself, possesses all his forces, subordinates them, and only  half makes use of them.    In spite of these drawbacks, this is a singularly original, attractive,  and strong work. Van Dyck will derive his best religious inspirations  from it. Philippe de Champagne will not imitate it, I am afraid, except  in its weak points, and from it will compose his French style. Otto Van  Veen should certainly applaud it. What should Van Oort think of it? As  for Jordaens, he is waiting for his fellow student to become more  distinctly and expressly Rubens before following him in these new ways.        _Les Maitres d' Autrefois_ (Paris, 1876).          BACCHUS AND ARIADNE    (_TITIAN_)    CHARLES LAMB      Hogarth excepted, can we produce any one painter within the last fifty  years, or since the humour of exhibiting began, that has treated a story  _imaginatively_? By this we mean, upon whom has subject so acted that it  has seemed to direct _him_--not to be arranged by him? Any upon whom its  leading or collateral points have impressed themselves so tyrannically,  that he dared not treat it otherwise, lest he should falsify a  revelation? Any that has imparted to his compositions, not merely so  much truth as is enough to convey a story with clearness, but that  individualizing property, which should keep the subject so treated  distinct in feature from every other subject, however similar, and to  common apprehensions almost identical; so as that we might say this and  this part could have found an appropriate place in no other picture in  the world but this? Is there anything in modern art--we will not demand  that it should be equal--but in any way analogous to what Titian has  effected, in that wonderful bringing together of two times in the  _Ariadne_, in the National Gallery? Precipitous, with his reeling Satyr  rout about him, repeopling and re-illuming suddenly the waste places,  drunk with a new fury beyond the grape, Bacchus, born in fire, fire-like  flings himself at the Cretan. This is the time present. With this  telling of the story an artist, and no ordinary one, might remain richly  proud. Guido in his harmonious version of it, saw no farther. But from  the depths of the imaginative spirit Titian has recalled past time, and  laid it contributory with the present to one simultaneous effect. With  the desert all ringing with the mad symbols of his followers, made lucid  with the presence and new offers of a god,--as if unconscious of  Bacchus, or but idly casting her eyes as upon some unconcerning  pageant--her soul undistracted from Theseus--Ariadne is still pacing the  solitary shore, in as much heart-silence, and in almost the same local  solitude, with which she awoke at daybreak to catch the forlorn last  glances of the sail that bore away the Athenian.    Here are two points miraculously co-uniting; fierce society, with the  feeling of solitude still absolute; noon-day revelations, with the  accidents of the dull grey dawn unquenched and lingering; the _present_  Bacchus with the _past_ Ariadne; two stories, with double Time;  separate, and harmonizing. Had the artist made the woman one shade less  indifferent to the God; still more, had she expressed a rapture at his  advent, where would have been the story of the mighty desolation of the  heart previous? merged in the insipid accident of a flattering offer met  with a welcome acceptance. The broken heart for Theseus was not lightly  to be pieced up by a God.        _Lamb's Complete Works_, edited by R.H. Shepherd (London, 1875).    [Illustration: BACCHUS AND ARIADNE.          _Titian_.]          BACCHUS AND ARIADNE    (_TITIAN_)    EDWARD T. COOK      But though as yet half unconscious, Ariadne is already under her fated  star: for above is the constellation of Ariadne's crown--the crown with  which Bacchus presented his bride. And observe in connection with the  astronomical side of the allegory the figure in Bacchus's train with the  serpent round him: this is the serpent-bearer (Milton's \"Ophiuchus  huge\") translated to the skies with Bacchus and Ariadne. Notice too  another piece of poetry: the marriage of Bacchus and Ariadne took place  in the spring, Ariadne herself being the personification of its return,  and Bacchus of its gladness; hence the flowers in the foreground which  deck his path.    The picture is as full of the painter's art as of the poet's. Note first  the exquisite painting of the vine leaves, and of these flowers in the  foreground, as an instance of the \"constant habit of the great masters  to render every detail of their foreground with the most laborious  botanical fidelity.\" \"The foreground is occupied with the common blue  iris, the _aquilegia_, and the wild rose (more correctly the _Capparis  Spinosa_); _every stamen_ of which latter is given, while the blossoms  and leaves of the columbine (a difficult flower to draw) have been  studied with the most exquisite accuracy.\" But this detail is sought not  for its own sake, but only so far as is necessary to mark the typical  qualities of beauty in the object. Thus \"while every stamen of the rose  is given because this was necessary to mark the flower, and while the  curves and large characters of the leaves are rendered with exquisite  fidelity, there is no vestige of particular texture, of moss, bloom,  moisture, or any other accident, no dewdrops, nor flies, nor trickeries  of any kind: nothing beyond the simple forms and hues of the flowers,  even those hues themselves being simplified and broadly rendered. The  varieties of _aquilegia_ have in reality a greyish and uncertain tone of  colour, and never attain the purity of blue with which Titian has gifted  his flower. But the master does not aim at the particular colour of  individual blossoms; he seizes the type of all, and gives it with the  utmost purity and simplicity of which colour is capable.\" A second point  to be noticed is the way in which one kind of truth has often to be  sacrificed in order to gain another. Thus here Titian sacrifices truth  of aerial effect to richness of tone--tone in the sense, that is, of  that quality of colour which makes us feel that the whole picture is in  one climate, under one kind of light, and in one kind of atmosphere. \"It  is difficult to imagine anything more magnificently impossible than the  blue of the distant landscape; impossible, not from its vividness, but  because it is not faint and aerial enough to account for its purity of  colour; it is too dark and blue at the same time; and there is indeed so  total a want of atmosphere in it, that, but for the difference of form,  it would be impossible to tell the mountains intended to be ten miles  off, from the robe of Ariadne close to the spectator. Yet make this blue  faint, aerial, and distant; make it in the slightest degree to resemble  the tint of nature's colour; and all the tone of the picture, all the  intensity and splendour will vanish on the instant.\"[3] We may notice  lastly what Sir Joshua Reynolds points out (Discourse VIII.), that the  harmony of the picture--that wonderful bringing together of two times of  which Lamb speaks above, is assisted by the distribution of colours. \"To  Ariadne is given (say the critics) a red scarf to relieve the figure  from the sea, which is behind her. It is not for that reason alone, but  for another of much greater consequence; for the sake of the general  harmony and effect of the picture. The figure of Ariadne is separated  from the great group, and is dressed in blue, which, added to the colour  of the sea, makes that quantity of cold colour which Titian thought  necessary for the support and brilliancy of the great group; which group  is composed, with very little exception, entirely of mellow colours. But  as the picture in this case would be divided into two distinct parts,  one half cold, and the other warm; it was necessary to carry some of the  mellow colours of the great group into the cold part of the picture, and  a part of the cold into the great group; accordingly, Titian gave  Ariadne a red scarf, and to one of the Bacchante a little blue drapery.\"    It is interesting to know that this great picture took Titian three  years, off and on, to finish. It was a commission from the Duke of  Ferrara, who supplied canvas and frame for it, and repeatedly wrote to  press for its delivery; it reached him in 1523.        _A Popular Handbook to the National Gallery_ (London and New York,      1888).
