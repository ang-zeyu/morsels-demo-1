Said the sages, \"In the first place,        The thing can not be done!      And, second, if it _could_ be,        It would not be any fun!      And, third, and most conclusive        And admitting no reply,      _You would have to change your nature!_        We should like to see you try!\"      They chuckled then triumphantly,        These lean and hairy shapes,      For these things passed as arguments        With the Anthropoidal Apes.        There was once a Neolithic Man,        An enterprising wight,      Who made his chopping implements        Unusually bright;      Unusually clever he,        Unusually brave,      And he drew delightful Mammoths        On the borders of his cave.        To his Neolithic neighbors,        Who were startled and surprised,      Said he, \"My friends, in course of time,        We shall be civilized!      We are going to live in cities!        We are going to fight in wars!      We are going to eat three times a day        Without the natural cause!      We are going to turn life upside down        About a thing called gold!      We are going to want the earth, and take        As much as we can hold!      We are going to wear great piles of stuff        Outside our proper skins!      We are going to have Diseases!        And Accomplishments!! And Sins!!!\"        Then they all rose up in fury        Against their boastful friend,      For prehistoric patience        Cometh quickly to an end:      Said one, \"This is chimerical!        Utopian! Absurd!\"      Said another, \"What a stupid life!        Too dull, upon my word!\"      Cried all, \"Before such things can come,        You idiotic child,      _You must alter Human Nature_!\"        And they all sat back and smiled:      Thought they, \"An answer to that last        It will be hard to find!\"      It was a clinching argument        To the Neolithic Mind!          THE OLD MAID'S HOUSE: IN PLAN    BY ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS      Corona had five hundred dollars and some pluck for her enterprise. She  had also at her command a trifle for furnishing. But that seemed very  small capital. Her friends at large discouraged her generously. Even Tom  said he didn't know about that, and offered her three hundred more.    This manly offer she declined in a womanly manner.    \"It is to be _my_ house, thank you, Tom, dear. I can live in yours at  home.\" ...    Corona's architectural library was small. She found on the top shelf one  book on the construction of chicken-roosts, a pamphlet in explanation of  the kindergarten system, a cook-book that had belonged to her  grandmother, and a treatise on crochet. There her domestic literature  came to an end. She accordingly bought a book entitled \"North American  Homes\"; then, having, in addition, begged or borrowed everything within  two covers relating to architecture that was to be found in her  immediate circle of acquaintance, she plunged into that unfamiliar  science with hopeful zeal.    The result of her studies was a mixed one. It was necessary, it seemed,  to construct the North American home in so many contradictory methods,  or else fail forever of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,  that Corona felt herself to be laboring under a chronic aberration of  mind.... Then the plans. Well, the plans, it must be confessed, Corona  _did_ find it difficult to understand. She always had found it difficult  to understand such things; but then she had hoped several weeks of close  architectural study would shed light upon the density of the subject.  She grew quite morbid about it. She counted the steps when she went  up-stairs to bed at night. She estimated the bedroom post when she  walked in the cold, gray dawn....    But the most perplexing thing about the plans was how one story ever got  upon another. Corona's imagination never fully grappled with this fact,  although her intellect accepted it. She took her books down-stairs one  night, and Susy came and looked them over.    \"Why, these houses are all one-story,\" said Susy. \"Besides, they're  nothing but lines, anyway. I shouldn't draw a house so.\"    Corona laughed with some embarrassment and no effort at enlightenment.  She was not used to finding herself and Susy so nearly on the same  intellectual level as in this instance. She merely asked: \"How should  you draw it?\"    \"Why, so,\" said Susy, after some severe thought. So she took her little  blunt lead pencil, that the baby had chewed, and drew her plan as  follows:    [Illustration: SUSY'S PLAN]    Corona made no comment upon this plan, except to ask Susy if that were  the way to spell L; and then to look in the dictionary, and find that it  was not spelled at all. Tom came in, and asked to see what they were  doing.    \"I'm helping Corona,\" said Susy, with much complacency. \"These  architects' things don't look any more like houses than they do like the  first proposition in Euclid; and the poor girl is puzzled.\"    \"_I'll_ help you to-morrow, Co,\" said Tom, who was in too much of a  hurry to glance at his wife's plan. But to-morrow Tom went into town by  the early train, and when Corona emerged from her \"North American  Homes,\" with wild eye and knotted brow, at 5 o'clock p.m., she found  Susy crying over a telegram which ran:         Called to California immediately. Those lost cargoes A No. 1 hides       turned up. Can't get home to say good-by. Send overcoat and       flannels by Simpson on midnight express. Gone four weeks. Love to       all.         TOM.    This unexpected event threw Corona entirely upon her own resources; and,  after a few days more of patient research, she put on her hat, and stole  away at dusk to a builder she knew of down-town--a nice, fatherly man  who had once built a piazza for Tom and had just been elected  superintendent of the Sunday-school. These combined facts gave Corona  confidence to trust her case to his hands. She carried a neat little  plan of her own with her, the result of several days' hard labor. Susy's  plan she had taken the precaution to cut into paper dolls for the baby.  Corona found the good man at home, and in her most business-like manner  presented her points.    \"Got any plan in yer own head?\" asked the builder, hearing her in  silence. In silence Corona laid before him the paper which had cost her  so much toil.    It was headed in her clear black hand:      PLAN    FOR A SMALL BUT HAPPY    HOME    This was    [Illustration: CORONA'S PLAN]    \"Well,\" said the builder, after a silence,--\"well, I've seen worse.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Corona, faintly.    \"How does she set?\" asked the builder.    \"Who set?\" said Corona, a little wildly. She could think of nothing that  set but hens.    \"Why, the house. Where's the points o' compass?\"    \"I hadn't thought of those,\" said Corona.    \"And the chimney,\" suggested the builder. \"Where's your chimneys?\"    \"I didn't put in any chimneys,\" said Corona.    \"Where did you count on your stairs?\" pursued the builder.    \"Stairs? I--forgot the stairs.\"    \"That's natural,\" said Mr. Timbers. \"Had a plan brought me once without  an entry or a window to it. It wasn't a woman did it, neither. It was a  widower, in the noospaper line. What's your scale?\"    \"Scale?\" asked Corona, without animation.    \"Scale of feet. Proportions.\"    \"Oh! I didn't have any scales, but I thought about forty feet front  would do. I have but five hundred dollars. A small house must answer.\"    The builder smiled. He said he would show her some plans. He took a book  from his table and opened at a plate representing a small, snug cottage,  not uncomely. It stood in a flourishing apple-orchard, and a much larger  house appeared dimly in the distance, upon a hill. The cottage was what  is called a \"story-and-half\" and contained six rooms. The plan was drawn  with the beauty of science.    \"There,\" said Mr. Timbers, \"I know a lady built one of those upon her  brother-in-law's land. He give her the land, and she just put up the  cottage, and they was all as pleasant as pease about it. That's about  what I'd recommend to you, if you don't object to the name of it.\"    \"What is the matter with the name?\" asked Corona.    \"Why,\" said the builder, hesitating, \"it is called the Old Maid's  House--in the _book_.\"    \"Mr. Timbers,\" said Corona, with decision, \"why should we seek further  than the truth? I will have that house. Pray, draw me the plan at  once.\"          DISTICHS    BY JOHN HAY          I        Wisely a woman prefers to a lover a man who neglects her.

We may, therefore, say that the tendency to  imitate serves to adjust the child to his environment. It is for this  reason that imitation has been called an _adaptive instinct_. It would  perhaps be better to say merely that the _tendency_ to imitate is part  of the _original equipment of man_.    Imitation is distinctively a human trait. While it occurs in lower  animals it is probably not an important factor in adjusting them to  their environment. But in the human race it is one of the chief factors  in adjustment to environment. Imitation is one of the main factors in  education. Usually the quickest way to teach a child to do a thing is to  show him how.    Through imitation we acquire our language, manners, and customs. Ideals,  beliefs, prejudices, attitudes, we take on through imitation. The  tendency to imitate others coupled with the desire to be thought well of  by others is one of the most powerful factors in producing conformity.  They are the whips which keep us within the bounds of custom and  conventionality. The tendency to imitate is so strong that its results  are almost as certain as are those of inherited tendencies. It is almost  as certain that a child will be like his parents in speech, manners,  customs, superstitions, etc., as it is that he will be like them in form  of body. He not only walks and talks and acts like his parents, but he  thinks as they do. We, therefore, have the term _social heredity_,  meaning the taking on of all sorts of social habits and ideals through  imitation.    The part that imitation plays in the education of a child may be learned  by going to a country home and noting how the boy learns to do all the  many things about the farm by imitating his father, and how the girl  learns to do all the housework by imitating her mother. Imitation is the  basis of much of the play of children, in that their play consists in  large part of doing what they see older people doing. This imitative  play gives them skill and is a large factor in preparing for the work of  life.    =Dramatization.= Dramatization is an aspect of imitation, and is a means  of making ideas more real than they would otherwise be. There is nothing  that leads us so close to reality as action. We never completely know an  act till we have done it. Dramatization is a matter of carrying an idea  out into action. Ideas give to action its greatest fullness of meaning.    Dramatic representation should, therefore, have a prominent place in the  schools, particularly in the lower grades. If the child is allowed to  mimic the characters in the reading lesson, the meaning of the lesson  becomes fuller. Later on in the school course, dramatic representation  of the characters in literature and history is a means of getting a  better conception of these characters. In geography, the study of the  manners and customs and occupations of foreign peoples can be much  facilitated through dramatic representation. Children naturally have the  dramatic tendency; it is one aspect of the tendency to imitate. We have  only to encourage it and make use of it throughout the school course.    =Imitation in Ideals.= Imitation is of importance not only in acquiring  the actions of life but also in getting our ideals. Habits of thinking  are no less an aspect of our lives than are habits of acting. Our  attitudes, our prejudices, our beliefs, our moral, religious, and  political ideals are in large measure copied from people about us. The  family and social atmosphere in which one lives is a mold in which one's  mind is formed and shaped. We cannot escape the influence of this  atmosphere if we would. One takes on a belief that his father has, one  clings to this belief and interprets the world in the light of it. This  belief becomes a part of one's nature. It is a mental habit, a way of  looking at the world. It is as much a part of one as red hair or big  feet or a crooked nose. Probably no other influence has so much to do  with making us what we are as social beings as the influence of  imitation.    =Play.= Play is usually considered to be a part of the original equipment  of man. It is essentially an expression of the ripening instincts of  children, and not a specific instinct itself. It is rather a sort of  make-believe activity of all the instincts. Kittens and dogs may be seen  in play to mimic fighting. They bite and chew each other as in real  fighting, but still they are not fighting.    As the structures and organs of children mature, they demand activity.  This early activity is called play. It has several characteristics. The  main one is that it is pleasurable. Play activity is pleasurable in  itself. We do not play that we may get something else which we like, as  is the case with the activity which we call work. Play is an end in  itself. It is not a means to get something else which is intrinsically  valuable.    One of the chief values of play comes from its activity aspect. We are  essentially motor beings. We grow and develop only through exercise. In  early life we do not have to exert ourselves to get a living. Play is  nature's means of giving our organs the exercise which they must have to  bring them to maturity. Play is an expression of the universal tendency  to action in early life. Without play, the child would not develop,  would not become a normal human being.    All day long the child is ceaselessly active. The value of this activity  can hardly be overestimated. It not only leads to healthy growth, but is  a means through which the child learns himself and the world. Everything  that the child sees excites him to react to it or upon it. He gets  possession of it. He bites it. He pounds it. He throws it. In this way  he learns the properties of things and the characteristics of forces.  Through play and imitation, in a very few years the child comes to a  successful adjustment in his world.    Play and imitation are the great avenues of activity in early life. Even  in later life, we seldom accomplish anything great or worth while until  the thing becomes play to us, until we throw our whole being into it as  we do in play, until it is an expression of ourselves as play is in our  childhood. The proper use of play gives us the solution of many of the  problems of early education.    Play has two functions in the school: (1) Motor play is necessary to  growth, development, and health. The constant activity of the child is  what brings about healthy growth.    In the country it is not difficult for children to get plenty of the  proper kind of exercise, but in the larger cities it is difficult.  Nevertheless, opportunity for play should be provided for every child,  no matter what the trouble or expense, for without play children cannot  become normal human beings. Everywhere parents and teachers should plan  for the play life of the children.    (2) In the primary grades play can have a large place in the actual work  of the school. The early work of education is to a large extent getting  the tools of knowledge and thought and work--reading, spelling,  writing, correct speech, correct writing, the elementary processes of  arithmetic, etc. In many ways play can be used in acquiring these tools.    One aspect of play particularly should have a large place in education;  namely, the manipulative tendencies of children. This is essentially  play. Children wish to handle and manipulate everything that attracts  their attention. They wish to tear it to pieces and to put it together.  This is nature's way of teaching, and by it children learn the  properties and structures of things. They thereby learn what things do  and what can be done with them. Teachers and parents should foster these  manipulative tendencies and use them for the child's good. These  tendencies are an aspect of curiosity. We want to know. We are unhappy  as long as a thing is before us which we do not understand, which has  some mystery about it. Nature has developed these tendencies in us, for  without a knowledge of our surroundings we could not live. The child  therefore has in his nature the basis of his education. We have but to  know this nature and wisely use and manipulate it to achieve the child's  education.      SUMMARY. Instincts are inherited tendencies to specific actions.    They fall under the heads: individualistic, socialistic,    environmental, adaptive, sexual or mating instincts. These inherited    tendencies are to a large extent the foundation on which we build    education. The educational problem is to control and guide them,    suppressing some, fostering others. In everything we undertake for a    child we must take into account these instincts.      CLASS EXERCISES    1. Make a study of the instincts of several animals, such as dogs, cats,  chickens. Make a list showing the stimuli and the inherited responses.    2. Make a study of the instincts of a baby. See how many inherited  responses you can observe. The simpler inherited responses are known as  _reflexes_. The closing of the eyelids mentioned in the text is an  example. How many such reflexes can you find in a child?    3. Make a special study of the fears of very young children. How many  definite situations can you find which excite fear responses in all  children? Each member of the class can make a list of his own fears. It  may then be seen whether any fears are common to all members of the  class and whether there are any sex differences.    4. Similarly, make a study of anger and fighting. What situations  invariably arouse the fighting response? In what definite, inherited  ways is anger shown? Do your studies and observations convince you that  the fighting instinct and other inherited responses concerned with  individual survival are among the strongest of inherited tendencies? Can  the fighting instinct be eliminated from the human"]]]
