You shall stay with me for a couple of days.\"    Hira's dwelling was surrounded by a wall. Inside were a couple of  clean mud-built huts. The walls of the rooms were decorated with  figures of flowers, birds, and gods. In the court-yard grew red-leaved  vegetables, and near them jasmine and roses. The gardener from the  Babu's house had planted them. If Hira had wished, he would have given  her anything from the Babu's garden. His profit in this was that Hira  with her own hand prepared his huka and handed it to him.    In one of the huts Hira slept; in the other her grandmother. Hira made  up a bed for Kunda beside her own. Kunda lay there, but did not sleep.  Kunda desired to remain hidden, and therefore consented to be locked  in the room on the following day when Hira went to her work, so that  she should not be seen by the grandmother. At noon, when the  grandmother went to bathe, Hira, coming home, permitted Kunda to bathe  and eat. After this meal Kunda was again locked in, and Hira returned  to her work till night, when she again made up the beds as before.    Creak, creak, creak--the sound of the chain of the outer door gently  shaken. Hira was astonished. One person only, the gatekeeper,  sometimes shook the chain to give warning at night. But in his hand  the chain did not speak so sweetly; it spoke threateningly, as though  to say, \"If you do not open, I will break the door.\" Now it seemed to  say, \"How are you, my Hira? Arise, my jewel of a Hira!\" Hira arose,  and opening the outer door saw a woman. At first she was puzzled, but  in a moment, recognizing the visitor, she exclaimed, \"Oh, _Ganga  jal_![11] how fortunate I am!\"    [Footnote 11: _Ganga jal_--Ganges water; a pet name given by Hira to  Malati. To receive this at the moment of death it essential to  salvation; therefore Hira expresses the hope to meet Malati in the  hour of death.]    Hira's _Ganga jal_ was Malati the milk-woman, whose home was at  Debipur, near Debendra Babu's house. She was a merry woman, from  thirty to thirty-two years of age, dressed in a _sari_ and wearing  shell bracelets, her lips red from the spices she ate; her complexion  was almost fair, with red spots on her cheeks; her nose flat, her  temples tattooed, a quid of tobacco in her cheek. Malati was not a  servant of Debendra's, not even a dependent, but yet a follower; the  services that others refused to perform, he obtained from her.    At sight of this woman the cunning Hira said: \"Sister _Ganga jal_! may  I meet you at my last moment; but why have you come now?\"    Malati whispered, \"Debendra Babu wants you.\"    Hira, with a laugh: \"Are you not to get anything?\"    Malati answered, \"You best know what you mean. Come at once.\"    As Hira desired to go, she told Kunda that she was called to her  master's house, and must go to see what was wanted. Then extinguishing  the light, she put on her dress and ornaments, and accompanied _Ganga  jal_, the two singing as they went some love song.    Hira went alone into Debendra's _boita khana_. He had been drinking,  but not heavily; he was quite sensible. His manner to Hira was  altogether changed; he paid her no compliments, but said: \"I had taken  so much that evening that I did not understand what you said. Why did  you come that night? it is to know this that I have sent for you. You  told me Kunda Nandini sent you, but you did not give her message. I  suppose that was because you found me so much overcome; but you can  tell me now.\"    \"Kunda Nandini did not send me to say anything.\"    \"Then why did you come?\" replied Debendra.    \"I only came to see you.\"    Debendra laughed. \"You are very intelligent. Nagendra Babu is  fortunate in possessing such a servant. I thought the talk about Kunda  Nandini was a mere pretence. You came to inquire after Haridasi  _Boisnavi_. You came to know my design in wearing the _Boisnavi_ garb;  why I went to the Datta house: this you came to learn, and in part you  accomplished your purpose. I do not seek to hide the matter. You did  your master's work, and have received your reward from him, no doubt.  I have a commission for you; do it, and I also will reward you.\"    It would be an unpleasant task to relate in detail the speech of a man  so deeply sunk in vice. Debendra, promising Hira an abundant reward,  proposed to buy Kunda Nandini.    At his words Hira's eyes reddened, her ears became like fire. When he  had finished she rose and said--    \"Sir, addressing me as a servant, you have said this to me. It is not  for me to reply. I will tell my master, and he will give you a  suitable answer.\" Then she went quickly out.    For some moments Debendra sat puzzled and cowed. Then to revive  himself he returned to the brandy, and the songs in which he usually  indulged.          CHAPTER XVI.    HIRA'S ENVY      Rising in the morning, Hira went to her work. For the past two days  there had been a great tumult in the Datta house, because Kunda  Nandini was not to be found. It was known to all the household that  she had gone away in anger. It was also known to some of the  neighbours. Nagendra heard that Kunda had gone, but no one told him  the reason. He thought to himself, \"Kunda has left because she does  not think it right to remain in the house after what I said to her. If  so, why does she not go with Kamal?\" Nagendra's brow was clouded. No  one ventured to come near him. He knew not what fault Surja Mukhi had  committed, yet he held no intercourse with her, but sent a female spy  into the neighbourhood to make search for Kunda Nandini.    Surja Mukhi was much distressed on hearing of Kunda's flight,  especially as Kamal Mani had assured her that what Debendra had said  was not worthy of credit: for if she had had any bond with Debendra  during three years, it could not have remained unknown; and Kunda's  disposition gave no reason for suspicion of such a thing. Debendra was  a drunkard, and in his cups he spoke falsely. Thinking over this,  Surja Mukhi's distress increased. In addition to that, her husband's  displeasure hurt her severely. A hundred times she abused Kunda--a  thousand times she blamed herself. She also sent people in search of  Kunda.    Kamal's postponed her departure for Calcutta. She abused no one. She  did not use a word of scolding to Surja Mukhi. Loosening her necklace  from her throat, she showed it to all the household, saying, \"I will  give this to whomsoever will bring Kunda back.\"    The guilty Hira heard and saw all this, but said nothing. Seeing the  necklace she coveted it, but repressed her desire. On the second day,  arranging her work, she went at noon, at which hour her grandmother  would be bathing, to give Kunda her meal. At night the two made their  bed, and laid down together. Neither Hira nor Kunda slept: Kunda was  kept awake by her sorrow; Hira by the mingled happiness and trouble of  her thoughts. But whatever her thoughts were she did not give them  words--they remained hidden.    Oh, Hira! Hira! you have not an evil countenance, you too are young;  why this vice in your heart? Why did the Creator betray her? Because  the Creator betrayed her, does she therefore wish to betray others? If  Hira were in Surja Mukhi's place, would she be so deceitful? Hira says  \"No!\" But sitting in Hira's place she speaks as Hira. People say all  evil that occurs is brought about by the wicked. Wicked people say, \"I  should have been virtuous, but through the faults of others have  become evil.\" Some say, \"Why has not five become seven?\" Five says, \"I  would have been seven, but two and five make seven. If the Creator or  the Creator's creatures had given me two more, I should have been  seven.\" So thought Hira.    Hira said to herself: \"Now what shall I do? Since the Creator has  given me the opportunity, why should I lose it through my own fault?  On the one side, if I take Kunda home to the Dattas, Kamal will give  me the necklace, and the _Grihini_ also will give me something. Shall  I spare the Babu? On the other hand, if I give Kunda to Debendra Babu,  I shall get a large sum of money at once. But I can't do that. Why  does Debendra think Kunda so beautiful? If I had good food, dressed  well, took my ease like a fine lady in a picture, I could be the same.  So simple a creature as Kunda can never understand the merits of  Debendra Babu. If there were no mud there would be no lotus, and Kunda  is the only woman who can excite love in Debendra Babu. Every one to  their destiny! But why am I angry? Why should I trouble myself? I  used to jest at love--I used to say it is mere talk, a mere story. Now  I laugh no longer. I used to say, 'If anyone loves let him love; I  shall never love any one.' Fate said, 'Wait, you will see by and by.'  In trying to seize the robber of other's wealth, I have lost my own  heart. What a face! what a neck! what a figure! is there another man  like him? That the fellow should tell _me_ to bring Kunda to him!  Could he set no one else this task? I could have struck him in the  face! I have come to love him so dearly, I could even find pleasure in  striking him. But let that pass. In that path there is danger; I must  not think of it. I have long ceased to look for joy or sorrow in this  life. Nevertheless, I cannot give Kunda into Debendra's hand; the  thought of it torments me. Rather I will so manage that she shall not  fall in his way. How shall I effect that? I will place Kunda where she  was before, thus she will escape him. Whether he dress as _Boisnavi_  or _Vasudeva_,[12] he will not obtain admission into that house;  therefore it will be well to take Kunda back there. But she will not  go! Her face is set against the house. But if all coax her she must  go. Another design I have in my mind; will God permit me to carry it  out? Why am I so angry with Surja Mukhi? She never did me any harm; on  the contrary, she loves me and is kind to me. Why, then, am I angry?  Because Surja Mukhi is happy,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17461"],[0,"The Great German Composers (#13)"],[1,"rolled down his face on perceiving its accuracy.    \"It is good, but too difficult for general use,\" said the friend.    \"Oh,\" said Wolfgang, \"it must be practised till it is learned. This is  the way it goes.\" So saying, he played it with perfect correctness.    About the same time he offered to take the violin at a performance of  some chamber music. His father refused, saying, \"How can you? You have  never learned the violin.\"    \"One needs not study for that,\" said this musical prodigy; and taking  the instrument, he played second violin with ease and accuracy. Such  precocity seems almost incredible, and only in the history of music does  it find any parallel.    Born in Salzburg, January 27, 1756, he was carefully trained by his  father, who resigned his place as court musician to devote himself  more exclusively to his family. From the earliest age he showed an  extraordinary passion for music and mathematics, scrawling notes and  diagrams in every place accessible to his insatiate pencil.    Taken to Vienna, the six-year-old virtuoso astonished the court by his  brilliant talents. The future Queen of France, Marie Antoinette, was  particularly delighted with him, and the little Mozart naively said he  would like to marry her, for she was so good to him. His father devoted  several years to an artistic tour, with him and his little less talented  sister, through the German cities, and it was also extended to Paris and  London. Everywhere the greatest enthusiasm was evinced in this charming  bud of promise. The father writes home: \"We have swords, laces,  mantillas, snuff-boxes, gold cases, sufficient to furnish a shop; but as  for money, it is a scarce article, and I am positively poor.\"    At Paris they were warmly received at the court, and the boy is said  to have expressed his surprise when Mme. Pompadour refused to kiss him,  saying: \"Who is she, that she will not kiss me? Have I not been kissed  by the queen?\" In London his improvisations and piano sonatas excited  the greatest admiration. Here he also published his third work. These  journeys were an uninterrupted chain of triumphs for the child-virtuoso  on the piano, organ, violin, and in singing. He was made honorary member  of the Academies of Bologna and Verona, decorated with orders,  and received at the age of thirteen an order to write the opera of  \"Mithridates,\" which was successfully produced at Milan in 1770. Several  other fine minor compositions were also written to order at this time  for his Italian admirers. At Rome Mozart attended the Sistine Chapel  and wrote the score of Allegri's great mass, forbidden by the pope to be  copied, from the memory of a single performance.    The record of Mozart's youthful triumphs might be extended at great  length; but aside from the proof they furnish of his extraordinary  precocity, they have lent little vital significance in the great problem  of his career, except so far as they stimulated the marvelous boy to lay  a deep foundation for his greater future, which, short as it was, was  fruitful in undying results.      II.    Mozart's life in Paris, where he lived with his mother in 1778 and  1779, was a disappointment, for he despised the French nation. His deep,  simple, German nature revolted from Parisian frivolity, in which he  found only sensuality and coarseness, disguised under a thin veneering  of social grace. He abhorred French music in these bitter terms: \"The  French are and always will be downright donkeys. They cannot sing, they  scream.\" It was just at this time that Gluck and Piccini were having  their great art-duel. We get a glimpse of the pious tendency of the  young composer in his characterization of Voltaire: \"The ungodly  arch-villain, Voltaire, has just died like a dog.\" Again he writes:  \"Friends who have no religion cannot long be my friends.... I have such  a sense of religion that I shall never do anything that I would not do  before the whole world.\"    With Mozart's return to Germany in 1779, being then twenty-three years  of age, comes the dawn of his classical period as a composer. The  greater number of his masses had already been written, and now he  settled himself in serious earnest to the cultivation of a true German  operatic school. This found its dawn in the production of \"Idomeneo,\"  his first really great work for the lyric stage.    The young composer had hard struggles with poverty in these days. His  letters to his father are full of revelations of his friction with  the little worries of life. Lack of money pinched him close, yet his  cheerful spirit was ever buoyant. \"I have only one small room; it is  quite crammed with a piano, a table, a bed, and a chest of drawers,\" he  writes.    Yet he would marry; for he was willing to face poverty in the  companionship of a loving woman who dared to face it with him. At  Mannheim he had met a beautiful young singer, Aloysia Weber, and he went  to Munich to offer her marriage. She, however, saw nothing attractive  in the thin, pale young man, with his long nose, great eyes, and  little head; for he was anything but prepossessing. A younger sister,  Constance, however, secretly loved Mozart, and he soon transferred his  repelled affections to this charming woman, whom he married in 1782 at  the house of Baroness Waldstetten. His _naive_ reasons for marrying show  Mozart's ingenuous nature. He had no one to take care of his linen, he  would not live dissolutely like other young men, and he loved Constance  Weber. His answer to his father, who objected on account of his poverty,  is worth quoting:    \"Constance is a well-conducted, good girl, of respectable parentage, and  I am in a position to earn at least _daily bread_ for her. We love  each other, and are resolved to marry. All that you have written or  may possibly write on the subject can be nothing but well-meant advice,  which, however good and sensible, can no longer apply to a man who has  gone so far with a girl.\"    Poor as Mozart was, he possessed such integrity and independence that  he refused a most liberal offer from the King of Prussia to become his  chapel-master, for some unexplained reason which involved his sense of  right and wrong. The first year of his marriage he wrote \"Il Seraglio,\"  and made the acquaintance of the aged Gluck, who took a deep interest in  him and warmly praised his genius. Haydn, too, recognized his brilliant  powers. \"I tell you, on the word of an honest man,\" said the author of  the \"Creation\" to Leopold Mozart, the father, who asked his opinion,  \"that I consider your son the greatest composer I have ever heard. He  writes with taste, and possesses a thorough knowledge of composition.\"    Poverty and increasing expense pricked Mozart into intense, restless  energy. His life had no lull in its creative industry. His splendid  genius, insatiable and tireless, broke down his body, like a sword  wearing out its scabbard. He poured out symphonies, operas, and sonatas  with such prodigality as to astonish us, even when recollecting how  fecund the musical mind has often been. Alike as artist and composer, he  never ceased his labors. Day after day and night after night he hardly  snatched an hour's rest. We can almost fancy he foreboded how short  his brilliant life was to be, and was impelled to crowd into its brief  compass its largest measure of results.    Yet he was always pursued by the spectre of want. Oftentimes his sick  wife could not obtain needed medicines. He made more money than most  musicians, yet was always impoverished. But it was his glory that he  was never impoverished by sensual indulgence, extravagance, and riotous  living, but by his lavish generosity to those who in many instances  needed help less than himself. Like many other men of genius and  sensibility, he could not say \"no\" to even the pretense of distress and  suffering.      III.    The culminating point of Mozart's artistic development was in 1786. The  \"Marriage of Figaro\" was the first of a series of masterpieces which  cannot be surpassed alike for musical greatness and their hold on  the lyric stage. The next year \"Don Giovanni\" saw the light, and was  produced at Prague. The overture of this opera was composed and scored  in less than six hours. The inhabitants of Prague greeted the work with  the wildest enthusiasm, for they seemed to understand Mozart better than  the Viennese.    During this period he made frequent concert tours to recruit his  fortunes, but with little financial success. Presents of watches,  snuff-boxes, and rings were common, but the returns were so small that  Mozart was frequently obliged to pawn his gifts to purchase a dinner and  lodging. What a comment on the period which adored genius, but allowed  it to starve! His audiences could be enthusiastic enough to carry him  to his hotel on their shoulders, but probably never thought that the  wherewithal of a hearty supper was a more seasonable homage. So our  musician struggled on through the closing years of his life with the  wolf constantly at his door, and an invalid wife whom he passionately  loved, yet must needs see suffer from the want of common necessaries. In  these modern days, when distinguished artists make princely fortunes  by the exercise of their musical gifts, it is not easy to believe that  Mozart, recognized as the greatest pianoforte player and composer of his  time by all of musical Germany, could suffer such dire extremes of want  as to be obliged more than once to beg for a dinner. In 1791 he composed  the score of the \"Magic Flute\" at the request of Schikaneder, a Viennese  manager, who had written the text from a fairy tale, the fantastic  elements of which are peculiarly German in their humor. Mozart put  great earnestness into the work, and made it the first German opera of  commanding merit, which embodied the essential intellectual sentiment  and kindly warmth of popular German life.
