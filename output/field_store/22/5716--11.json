What!  do they suppose that every thing has been said that _can_ be said about  any one Christmas thing?        About beef, for instance?      About plum-pudding?      About mince-pie?      About holly?      About ivy?      About rosemary?      About mistletoe? (Good Heavens! what an immense number of things      remain to be said about mistletoe!)      About Christmas Eve?      About hunt-the-slipper?      About hot cockles?      About blind-man's-buff?      About shoeing the wild-mare?      About thread-the-needle?      About he-can-do-little-that-can't-do-this?      About puss-in-the-corner?      About snap-dragon?      About forfeits?      About Miss Smith?      About the bell-man?      About the waits?      About chilblains?      About carols?      About the fire?      About the block on it?      About school-boys?      About their mothers?      About Christmas-boxes?      About turkeys?      About Hogmany?      About goose-pie?

About hackins?      About yule-doughs?      About going-a-gooding?      About loaf-stealing?      About _Julklaps_? (Who has exhausted that subject,        we should like to know?)      About wad-shooting?      About elder-wine?      About pantomimes?      About cards?      About New-Year's Day?      About gifts?      About wassail?      About Twelfth-cake?      About king and queen?      About characters?      About eating too much?      About aldermen?      About the doctor?      About all being in the wrong?      About charity?      About all being in the right?      About faith, hope, and endeavor?      About the greatest plum-pudding for the greatest number?    _Esto perpetua_,--that is, faith, hope and charity, and endeavor; and  plum-pudding enough by and by, all the year round, for everybody that  likes it. Why that should not be the case, we cannot see,--seeing that  the earth is big, and human kind teachable, and God very good, and  inciting us to do it. Meantime, gravity apart, we ask anybody whether  any of the above subjects are exhausted; and we inform everybody, that  all the above customs still exist in some parts of our beloved country,  however unintelligible they may have become in others. But to give a  specimen of the non-exhaustion of any one of their topics.    Beef, for example. Now, we should like to know who has exhausted the  subject of the fine old roast Christmas piece of beef, from its original  appearance in the meadows as part of the noble sultan of the herd,  glorious old Taurus,--the lord of the sturdy brow and ponderous agility,  a sort of thunderbolt of a beast, well chosen by Jove to disguise in,  one of Nature's most striking compounds of apparent heaviness and  unencumbered activity,--up to its contribution to the noble  Christmas-dinner, smoking from the spit, and flanked by the outposts of  Bacchus. John Bull (cannibalism apart) hails it like a sort of relation.  He makes it part of his flesh and blood; glories in it; was named after  it; has it served up, on solemn occasions, with music and a hymn, as it  was the other day at the royal city dinner:--        \"Oh the roast beef of old England!      And oh the old English roast beef!\"    \"_And_ oh!\" observe, not merely \"oh!\" again; but \"and\" with it; as if,  though the same piece of beef, it were also another,--another and the  same,--cut, and come again; making two of one, in order to express  intensity and reduplication of satisfaction:--        \"Oh the roast beef of old England!      _And_ oh the old English roast beef!\"    We beg to assure the reader, that a whole _Seer_ might be written on  this single point of the Christmas-dinner; and \"shall we be told\" (as  orators exclaim), \"and this, too, in a British land,\" that the subject  is \"_exhausted_\"!    Then plum-pudding! What a word is that! how plump and plump again! How  round and repeated and plenipotential! (There are two p's, observe, in  plenipotential; and so there are in plum-pudding. We love an exquisite  fitness,--a might and wealth of adaptation). Why, the whole round cheek  of universal childhood is in the idea of plum-pudding; ay, and the  weight of manhood, and the plenitude of the majesty of city dames.  Wealth itself is symbolized by the least of its fruity particles. \"A  plum\" is a city fortune,--a million of money. He (the old boy, who has  earned it)--        \"Puts in his thumb,    _videlicet_, into his pocket,        And pulls out a plum,      And says, What a _good man_ am I!\"    Observe a little boy at a Christmas-dinner, and his grandfather opposite  him. What a world of secret similarity there is between them! How hope  in one, and retrospection in the other, and appetite in both, meet over  the same ground of pudding, and understand it to a nicety! How the  senior banters the little boy on his third slice! and how the little boy  thinks within himself that he dines that day as well as the senior! How  both look hot and red and smiling, and juvenile. How the little boy is  conscious of the Christmas-box in his pocket! (of which, indeed, the  grandfather jocosely puts him in mind); and how the grandfather is quite  as conscious of the plum, or part of a plum, or whatever fraction it may  be, in his own! How he incites the little boy to love money and good  dinners all his life! and how determined the little boy is to abide by  his advice,--with a secret addition in favor of holidays and  marbles,--to which there is an analogy, in the senior's mind, on the  side of trips to Hastings, and a game at whist! Finally, the old  gentleman sees his own face in the pretty smooth one of the child; and  if the child is not best pleased at his proclamation of the likeness (in  truth, is horrified at it, and thinks it a sort of madness), yet nice  observers, who have lived long enough to see the wonderful changes in  people's faces from youth to age, probably discern the thing well  enough, and feel a movement of pathos at their hearts in considering the  world of trouble and emotion that is the causer of the changes. _That_  old man's face was once like that little boy's! _That_ little boy's will  be one day like that old man's! What a thought to make us all love and  respect one another, if not for our fine qualities, let at least for the  trouble and sorrow which we all go through!    Ay, and joy too; for all people have their joys as well as troubles, at  one time or another,--most likely both together, or in constant  alternation: and the greater part of troubles are not the worst things  in the world, but only graver forms of the requisite motion of the  universe, or workings towards a better condition of things, the greater  or less violent according as we give them violence, or respect them like  awful but not ill-meaning gods, and entertain them with a rewarded  patience. Grave thoughts, you will say, for Christmas. But no season has  a greater right to grave thoughts, in passing; and, for that very  reason, no season has a greater right to let them pass, and recur to  more light ones.    So a noble and merry season to you, my masters; and may we meet, thick  and three-fold, many a time and oft, in blithe yet most thoughtful  pages! Fail not to call to mind, in the course of the 25th of this  month, that the divinest Heart that ever walked the earth was born on  that day: and then smile and enjoy yourselves for the rest of it; for  mirth is also of Heaven's making, and wondrous was the wine-drinking at  Galilee.           *       *       *       *       *        SONG OF THE HOLLY        WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE            Blow, blow thou winter wind--          Thou art not so unkind              As man's ingratitude!

O sweet nightingale, wait        Till I listen and hear        If a step draweth near,        For my love he is late!    \"The skies in the darkness stoop nearer and nearer,    A cluster of stars hangs like fruit in the tree,  The fall of the water comes sweeter, comes clearer:    To what art thou listening, and what dost thou see?        Let the star-clusters grow,        Let the sweet waters flow.        And cross quickly to me.    \"You night-moths that hover where honey brims over    From sycamore blossoms, or settle or sleep;  You glowworms, shine out, and the pathway discover    To him that comes darkling along the rough steep.        Ah, my sailor, make haste,        For the time runs to waste,        And my love lieth deep,    \"Too deep for swift telling; and yet, my one lover,    I've conned thee an answer, it waits thee to-night.\"  By the sycamore passed he, and through the white clover;    Then all the sweet speech I had fashioned took flight;        But I'll love him more, more        Than e'er wife loved before,        Be the days dark or bright.        _Jean Ingelow._          Seven Times Four    MATERNITY      Heigh-ho! daisies and buttercups,    Fair yellow daffodils, stately and tall!  When the wind wakes, how they rock in the grasses,    And dance with the cuckoo-buds slender and small!  Here's two bonny boys, and here's mother's own lasses        Eager to gather them all.    Heigh-ho! daisies and buttercups!    Mother shall thread them a daisy chain;  Sing them a song of the pretty hedge-sparrow,    That loved her brown little ones, loved them full fain;  Sing, \"Heart, thou art wide though the house be but narrow,\"--        Sing once, and sing it again.    Heigh-ho! daisies and buttercups,    Sweet wagging cowslips, they bend and they bow;  A ship sails afar over warm ocean waters,    And haply one musing doth stand at her prow,  O bonny brown son, and O sweet little daughters,        Maybe he thinks on you now!    Heigh-ho! daisies and buttercups,    Fair yellow daffodils, stately and tall!  A sunshiny world full of laughter and leisure,    And fresh hearts unconscious of sorrow and thrall!  Send down on their pleasure smiles passing its measure,        God that is over us all!        _Jean Ingelow._          Autumn Woods      Ere, in the northern gale,    The summer tresses of the trees are gone,  The woods of Autumn, all around our vale,    Have put their glory on.    The mountains that infold,    In their wide sweep, the colored landscape round,  Seem groups of giant kings, in purple and gold,    That guard the enchanted ground.    I roam the woods that crown    The upland, where the mingled splendors glow,  Where the gay company of trees look down    On the green fields below.    My steps are not alone    In these bright walks; the sweet southwest, at play,  Flies, rustling, where the painted leaves are strown    Along the winding way.    And far in heaven, the while,    The sun, that sends that gale to wander here,  Pours out on the fair earth his quiet smile,--    The sweetest of the year.    Where now the solemn shade,    Verdure and gloom where many branches meet;  So grateful, when the noon of summer made    The valleys sick with heat?    Let in through all the trees    Come the strange rays; the forest depths are bright;  Their sunny-colored foliage, in the breeze,    Twinkles, like beams of light.    The rivulet, late unseen,    Where bickering through the shrubs its waters run,  Shines with the image of its golden screen    And glimmerings of the sun.    But 'neath yon crimson tree,    Lover to listening maid might breathe his flame,  Nor mark, within its roseate canopy,    Her blush of maiden shame.    Oh, Autumn! why so soon    Depart the hues that make thy forests glad;  Thy gentle wind and thy fair sunny noon,    And leave thee wild and sad?    Ah! 'twere a lot too blessed    Forever in thy colored shades to stray;  Amid the kisses of the soft southwest    To rove and dream for aye;    And leave the vain low strife    That makes men mad--the tug for wealth and power,  The passions and the cares that wither life,    And waste its little hour.        _William Cullen Bryant._          The Drummer Boy of Mission Ridge      Did you ever hear of the Drummer Boy of Mission Ridge, who lay  With his face to the foe, 'neath the enemy's guns, in the charge of       that terrible day?  They were firing above him and firing below, and the tempest of shot       and shell  Was raging like death, as he moaned in his pain, by the breastworks       where he fell.    \"Go back with your corps,\" our colonel had said, but he waited the       moment when  He might follow the ranks and shoulder a gun with the best of us       bearded men;  And so when the signals from old Fort Wood set an army of veterans wild,  He flung down his drum, which spun down the hill like the ball of a       wayward child.    And then he fell in with the foremost ranks of brave old company G,  As we charged by the flank, with our colors ahead, and our columns       closed up like a V,  In the long, swinging lines of that splendid advance, when the flags       of our corps floated out,  Like the ribbons that dance in the jubilant lines of the march of a       gala day rout.    He charged with the ranks, though he carried no gun, for the colonel       had said him nay,  And he breasted the blast of the bristling guns, and the shock of the       sickening fray;  And when by his side they were falling like hail he sprang to a comrade       slain,  And shouldered his musket and bore it as true as the hand that was dead       in pain.    'Twas dearly we loved him, our Drummer Boy, with a fire in his bright,       black eye,  That flashed forth a spirit too great for his form--he only was just so       high,  As tall, perhaps, as your little lad who scarcely reaches your shoulder--  Though his heart was the heart of a veteran then, a trifle, it may be,       bolder.    He pressed to the front, our lad so leal, and the works were almost won,  A moment more and our flags had swung o'er the muzzle of murderous gun;  But a raking fire swept the van, and he fell 'mid the wounded and slain,  With his wee wan face turned up to Him who feeleth His children's pain.    Again and again our lines fell back, and again with shivering shocks  They flung themselves on the rebels' works as ships are tossed on rocks;  To be crushed and broken and scattered amain, as the wrecks of the       surging storm.  Where none may rue and none may reck of aught that has human form.    So under the ridge we were lying for the order to charge again,  And we counted our comrades missing, and we counted our comrades slain;  And one said, \"Johnny, our Drummer Boy, is grievously shot and lies  Just under the enemy's breastwork; if left on the field he dies.\"    Then all the blood that was in me  surged up to my aching brow,  And my heart leaped up like a ball in my throat--I can feel it even now,  And I said I would bring that boy from the field, if God would spare my       breath,  If all the guns in Mission Ridge should thunder the threat of death.    I crept and crept up the ghastly ridge, by the wounded and the dead,  With the moans of my comrades right and left, behind me and yet ahead,  Till I came to the form of our Drummer Boy, in his blouse of dusty blue,  With his face to the foe, 'neath the enemy's guns, where the blast of       the battle blew.    And his gaze as he met my own just there would have melted a heart of       stone,  As he tried like a wounded bird to rise, and placed his hand in my own;  And he said in a voice half smothered, though its whispering thrills       me yet,  \"I think in a moment more that I would have stood on that parapet.    \"But now I nevermore will climb, and, Sergeant, when you see  The men go up those breastworks there, just stop and waken me;  For though I cannot make the charge  and join the cheers that rise,  I may forget my pain to see the old flag kiss the skies.\"    Well, it was hard to treat him so, his poor limb shattered sore,  But I raised him on my shoulder and to the surgeon bore;  And the boys who saw us coming each gave a shout of joy,  And uttered fervent prayers for him, our valiant Drummer Boy.    When sped the news that \"Fighting Joe\" had saved the Union right,  With his legions fresh from Lookout; and that Thomas massed his might  And forced the rebel center; and our cheering ran like wild;  And Sherman's heart was happy as the heart of a little child;    When Grant from his lofty outlook saw our flags by the hundred fly  Along the slopes of Mission Ridge, where'er he cast his eye;  And when we heard the thrilling news of the mighty battle done,  The fearful contest ended, and the glorious victory won;    Then his bright black eyes so yearning grew strangely rapt and wide,  And in that hour of conquest our little hero died.  But ever in our hearts he dwells, with a grace that ne'er is old,  For him the heart to duty wed can nevermore grow cold!    And when they tell of heroes, and the laurels they have won,  Of the scars they are doomed to carry, of the deeds that they have done;  Of the horror to be biding among the ghastly dead,  The gory sod beneath them, the bursting shell o'erhead,    My heart goes back to Mission Ridge and the Drummer Boy who lay  With his face to the foe, 'neath the enemy's guns, in the charge of       that terrible day;  And I say that the land that bears such sons is crowned and dowered       with all  The dear God giveth nations to stay them lest they fall.    Oh, glory of Mission Ridge, stream on, like the roseate light of morn,  On the sons that now are living, on the sons that are yet unborn!  And cheers for our comrades living, and tears as they pass away!  And three times three for the Drummer Boy who fought at the front that       day!          If--      If you can keep your head when all about you    Are"]]]
