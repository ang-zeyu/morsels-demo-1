Difficulties assail the missionary at every step; and every honest man,  whether his views be broad or high or low, must sympathise with the  earnest efforts the missionaries are making for the good and advancement  of the Chinese.    Look for example at the difficulty there is in telling a Chinese, who  has been taught to regard the love of his parents as his chief duty, as  his forefathers have been taught for hundreds of generations before  him--the difficulty there is in explaining to him, in his own language,  the words of Christ, \"If any man come to Me and hate not his father, he  cannot be My disciple. For I am come to set a man at variance against  his father.\"    In the patriarchal system of government which prevails in China, the  most awful crime that a son can commit, is to kill his parent, either  father or mother. And this is said to be, though the description is no  doubt abundantly exaggerated, the punishment of his crime. He is put to  death by the \"_Ling chi_,\" or \"degrading and slow process,\" and his  younger brothers are beheaded; his house is razed to the ground and the  earth under it dug up several feet deep; his neighbours are severely  punished; his principal teacher is decapitated; the district magistrate  is deprived of his office; and the higher officials of the province  degraded three degrees in rank.    Such is the enormity of the crime of parricide in China; yet it is to  the Chinese who approves of the severity of this punishment that the  missionary has to preach, \"And the children shall rise up against their  parents and cause them to be put to death.\"    The China Inland Mission, as a body of courageous workers, brave  travellers, unselfish and kindly men endowed with every manly virtue  that can command our admiration, is worthy of all the praise that can  be bestowed on it. Most of its members are men who have been saved after  reaching maturity, and delicately-nurtured emotional girls with  heightened religious feelings.    Too often entirely ignorant of the history of China, a mighty nation  which has \"witnessed the rise to glory and the decay of Egypt, Assyria,  Babylonia, Persia, Greece, and Rome, and still remains the only monument  of ages long bygone,\" of its manners and polity, customs and religions,  and of the extraordinary difficulties in the acquirement of its  language, too often forgetful that the Chinese are a people whose  \"prepossessions and prejudices and cherished judgments are the growth of  millenniums,\" they come to China hoping that miraculous assistance will  aid them in their exposition of the Christian doctrine, in language  which is too often impenetrable darkness to its hearers.    \"They are God's lost ones who are in China, and God cares for them and  yearns over them,\" and men who were in England respectable artisans,  with an imperfect hold of their own language, come to China, in response  to the \"wail of the dying millions,\" to stay this \"awful ruin of souls,\"  who, at the rate of 33,000 a day, are \"perishing without hope, having  sinned without law.\"    Six months after their arrival they write to _China's Millions_: \"Now  for the news! Glorious news this time! Our services crowded! Such bright  intelligent faces! So eager to hear the good news! They seemed to drink  in every word, and to listen as if they were afraid that a word might be  lost.\" Five years later they write: \"The first convert in Siao Wong Miao  was a young man named Sengleping, a matseller. He was very earnest in  his efforts to spread the Gospel, but about the beginning of the year  he became insane. The poor man lost his reason, but not his piety.\"  (_China's Millions_, iv., 5, 95, and 143).    A young English girl at this mission, who has been more than a year in  China, tells me that she has never felt the Lord so near her as she has  since she came to China, nor ever realised so entirely His abundant  goodness. Poor thing, it made me sad to talk to her. In England she  lived in a bright and happy home with brothers and sisters, in a  charming climate. She was always well and full of life and vigour,  surrounded by all that can make life worth living. In China she is never  well; she is almost forgetting what is the sensation of health; she is  anaemic and apprehensive; she has nervous headaches and neuralgia; she  can have no pleasure, no amusement whatever; her only relaxation is  taking her temperature; her only diversion a prayer meeting. She is  cooped up in a Chinese house in the unchanging society of a married  couple--the only exercise she can permit herself is a prison-like walk  along the top of the city at the back of the mission. Her lover, a  refined English gentleman who is also in the mission, lives a week's  journey away, in Chungking, a depressing fever-stricken city where the  sun is never seen from November to June, and blazes with unendurable  fierceness from July to October. In England he was full of strength and  vigour, fond of boating and a good lawn-tennis player. In China he is  always ill, anaemic, wasted, and dyspeptic, constantly subject to low  forms of fever, and destitute of appetite. But more agonising than his  bad health is the horrible reality of the unavailing sacrifice he is  making--no converts but \"outcasts subsidised to forsake their family  altars;\" no reward but the ultimate one which his noble self-devotion  is laying up for himself in Heaven. No man with a healthy brain can  discern \"Blessing\" in the work of these two missionaries, nor be blind  to the fact that it is the reverse of worshipful to return effusive  thanks to the great Almighty, \"who yearns over the Chinese, His lost  ones,\" for \"vouchsafing the abundant mercies\" of a harvest of six  doubtful converts as the work of three missionaries for three years.    There are 180,000 people in Suifu, and, as is the case with Chinese  cities, a larger area than that under habitation is occupied by the  public graveyard outside the city, which covers the hill slopes for  miles and miles. The number of opium-smokers is so large that the  question is not, who does smoke opium, but who doesn't. In the mission  street alone, besides the Inland Mission, the Buddhist Temple,  Mohammedan Mosque, and Roman Catholic Mission, there are eight  opium-houses. Every bank, silk shop, and hong, of any pretension  whatever, throughout the city, has its opium-room, with the lamp always  lit ready for the guest. Opium-rooms are as common as smoking rooms are  with us. A whiff of opium rather than a nip of whisky is the preliminary  to business in Western China.    [Illustration: OPIUM-SMOKING.]    An immensely rich city is Suifu with every advantage of position, on a  great waterway in the heart of a district rich in coal and minerals and  inexhaustible subterranean reservoirs of brine. Silks and furs and  silverwork, medicines, opium and whitewax, are the chief articles of  export, and as, fortunately for us, Western China can grow but little  cotton, the most important imports are Manchester goods.    Szechuen is by far the richest province of the eighteen that constitute  the Middle Kingdom. Its present Viceroy, Liu, is a native of Anhwei; he  is, therefore, a countryman of Li Hung Chang to whom he is related by  marriage, his daughter having married Li Hung Chang's nephew. Its  provincial Treasurer is believed to occupy the richest post held by any  official in the empire. It is worth noticing that the present provincial  Treasurer, Kung Chao-yuan, has just been made (1894) Minister  Plenipotentiary to Great Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Sweden and  Norway, and one can well believe how intense was his chagrin when he  received this appointment from the \"Imperial Supreme\" compelling him, as  it did, to forsake the tombs of his ancestors--to leave China for  England on a fixed salary, and vacate the most coveted post in the  empire, a post where the opportunities of personal enrichment are simply  illimitable.    In Suifu there are two magistrates, both with important yamens. The Fu  magistrate is the \"Father of the City,\" the Hsien magistrate is the  \"Mother of the City;\" and the \"Mother of the City\" largely favours the  export opium trade. When Protestant missionaries first came to the city  in 1888 and 1889 there was little friendliness shown to them. Folk would  cry after the missionary, \"There goes the foreigner that eats children,\"  and children would be hurriedly hidden, as if from fear. These taunts  were at first disregarded. But there came a time when living children  were brought to the mission for sale as food; whereupon the mission made  formal complaint in the yamen, and the Fu at once issued a proclamation  checking the absurd tales about the foreigners, and ordering the  citizens, under many pains and penalties, to treat the foreigners with  respect. There has been no trouble since, and, as we walked through the  crowded streets, I could see nothing but friendly indifference.  Reference to this and other sorrows is made in the missionary's report  to _China's Millions_, November, 1893:--    \"Soon after this trial had passed away (the rumours of baby eating),  still more painful internal sorrow arose. One of the members, who had  been baptised three years before and had been useful as a preacher of  the Gospel, fell into grievous sin, and had to be excluded from Church  fellowship. Then a little later a very promising inquirer, who had been  cured of opium-smoking and appeared to be growing in grace, fell again  under its power. While still under a cloud he was suddenly removed  during the cholera visitation.\"    The China Inland Mission has pleasant quarters close under the city  wall.

On the whole, we are inclined to believe Mr. Sherman's experiments  have not yet developed a definite process, and we shall receive with  much allowance the glowing statements published in regard to it, until  such time as it can face the world and defy unbelief.    The patents obtained by Mr. Sherman seem to cover the use of iodine,  rather than the manner of using it, and throw no light upon the  rationale of the process.    A patent was granted by the United States Patent Office, Sept. 13,  1870, to J. C. Atwood, in which the inventor claims the use of iodide  of potassium in connection with the carbons and fluxes used in making  and refining iron. In his specification he states that he uses about  _fifteen grains_ of this salt to eighty pounds of the metal. This  is about 1/373 of one per cent. He uses in connection with this  exceedingly small proportion of iodide of potassium, about two ounces  of lampblack, or charcoal, and four ounces of manganese, and asserts  that steel made with these materials will be superior in quality  to that made by the old method. These claims we are inclined to  discredit. Certainly, we see no chemical reason why this small amount  of iodide should produce such an effect, and the specification itself  throws no light upon our darkness.    If the experiments in these so-called processes have no better basis  than is apparent from such information as at present can be gathered  respecting them, it is probable we shall wait some time before the  promised revolution in iron and steel manufacture is accomplished  through their use.           *       *       *       *       *          RUBBER TIRES FOR TRACTION ENGINES.      When it was first discovered that a smooth-faced driving wheel,  running on a smooth-faced rail, would \"bite,\" the era of iron railways  and locomotive engines may be said to have fairly commenced. The  correction of a single radical error was, in this case, the dawn of a  new system of travel, so extensive in its growth and marvelous in its  results, that even the wildest dreamer could not, at that time, have  imagined the consequences of so simple a discovery.    A popular and somewhat similar error regarding the bite of wheels on  rough and uneven surfaces, has also prevailed. We say popular error,  because engineers have not shared it, and it has obtained, to any  notable extent, only among those unfamiliar with mechanical science.  The error in question is, that hard-surfaced wheels will not bite on  a moderately rough surface, sufficiently to give an efficient tractile  power. It seems strange that this error should have diffused itself  very extensively, when it is remembered that a certain degree of  roughness is essential to frictional resistance. The smoothness of the  ordinary railway track is roughness compared to that of an oiled or  unctuous metallic surface; and it has been amply demonstrated that  the resistance of friction, of two bearing surfaces depends, not  upon their extent, but upon the pressure with which they are forced  together. A traction wheel, of given weight, resting upon two square  inches of hard earth or rock, would develop the same tractile power  as though it had a bearing surface of two square feet of similar  material.    On very rough and stony ways, however, another element practically of  no importance on moderately rough ways, like a macadam surface or a  concrete road, where the prominences are nearly of uniform hight, and  so near together as to admit between their summits only very small  arcs of the circumference of the wheel; comes into action. This  element is the constantly recurring lifting of the superincumbent  weight of the machine. Even this would not result in loss of power,  could the power developed in falling be wholly applied to useful work  in the direction of the advance of the engine. The fact is, however,  that it is not so applied, and in any method of propulsion at present  known to engineering science, cannot be so applied. Above a certain  point where friction enough is developed to prevent slip, the more  uneven the road surface is, the greater the power demanded for the  propulsion of the locomotive. And this will hold good for both hard  and soft-tired wheels.    What then is the advantage, if any, of rubber-tired wheels? The  advantages claimed may be enumerated as follows: increased tractile  power, with a given weight, secured without damage to roadways; ease  of carriage to the supported machinery, whereby it--the machinery--is  saved from stress and wear; and economy of the power, expended in  moving the extra weight required by rigid-tired wheels, to secure the  required frictional resistance. The last-mentioned claim depends upon  the first, and must stand or fall with it. The saving of roadway,  ease of carriage, and its favorable result upon the machinery, are  generally conceded.    A denial of the first claim has been made, by those interested in the  manufacture of rigid-tired traction engines and others, in so far  as the rubber tires are employed on comparatively smooth surfaces;  although the increased tractile power on quite _rough_ pavements and  roads is acknowledged.    This denial is based upon results of experiments performed on the  streets of Rochester, England, between the 9th October and the 2nd  November, 1870, by a committee of the Royal Engineers (British Army),  with a view to determine accurately the point in question.    Care was taken to make the circumstances, under which the trials  took place, exactly alike for both the rubber and the iron tires. The  experiments were performed with an Aveling and Porter six-horse power  road engine, built in the Royal Engineers' establishment. The weight  of the engine, without rubber tires, was 11,225 pounds; with rubber  tires, it weighed 12,025 pounds. Without rubber tires it drew 2.813  times its own weight up a gradient of 1 in 11; with rubber  tires, it drew up the same incline 2.763 times the weight of engine,  with the weight of rubber tires added; showing that, although it drew  a little over 2,200 pounds more than it could do without the rubber  tires, the increase of traction was only that which might be expected  from the additional weight.    It is claimed, moreover, that the additional traction power and  superior ease of carriage on rough roads, secured with rubber tires,  is dearly bought at the very great increase in cost, of an engine  fitted with them, over one not so fitted.    This is a point we regard as not fully settled, though it will not  long remain in doubt. There are enough of both types of wheels now in  use to soon answer practically any question there may be of durability  (upon which the point of economy hinges), so far as the interest on  the increased cost due to rubber tires, is offset against the greater  wear and tear of iron rimmed wheels. It is stated, on good authority  that a rubber tired engine, started at work in Aberdeen, Scotland,  wore out its tires between April and September, inclusive, and when  it is taken into consideration, that the cost of these tires is  about half that of other engines, made with solid iron rimmed driving  wheels, it will be seen that, unless very much greater durability than  this can be shown for the rubber, the advantages of such tires are  very nearly, if not more than, balanced by their disadvantages.    The fact that one set of tires wore out so soon does not prove a rule.  There may have been causes at work which do not affect such tires  generally, and it would be, we think, quite premature to form  favorable or unfavorable judgment, of relative economy from such data  as have been yet furnished.    The difference in the current expenses of running the two most  prominent types of engines, with hard and soft tires, now in use, does  not affect the question of rubber tires, unless it can be shown that  these tires necessitate, _per se_, such a form of engine as requires  a greater consumption of fuel, and greater cost of attendance, to  perform a given amount of work.           *       *       *       *       *          CENTRAL SHAFT OF THE HOOSAC TUNNEL.      As many of our readers have evinced much interest and ingenuity on  the question of the propriety of placing reliance upon the accuracy of  dropping a perpendicular from the top to the bottom of a shaft 1,030  feet in depth, by means of an ordinary plummet, we take the earliest  opportunity of settling the matter beyond dispute, by reporting  the results lately obtained, through a series of experiments by the  engineers in charge, for the ultimate purpose of laying down the  correct line for the tunnel.    The perpendicular line has, of course, been dropped many times, and  the main result taken. The plummet used is made of steel, properly  balanced and polished, in shape something like a pineapple, and of  about the same size, weighing fifteen pounds. It was suspended, with  the large end downwards, by a thin copper wire, one fortieth of an  inch in diameter, immersed in water; and, after careful steadying with  the hand, occupied about an hour in assuming its final position or  motion, which, contrary to the expectation and theories of many,  resulted in a circular motion around a fixed point, the diameter of  the circle being a mean of one quarter of an inch. The suspending  wire in these operations was not quite the entire length of the shaft,  being only 900 feet; and before the plummet had settled, the wire had  stretched nearly twenty feet.    The suspension of the plummet in water was not considered necessary  for any other reason than that water was continually trickling down  the wire, and dropping on the plummet. The experiments so far have  not been of the perfect character it is determined to attain, when the  final alignment is made, as, until the headings east and west of the  shaft have advanced to a considerable distance, any slight error would  be of no "]]]
