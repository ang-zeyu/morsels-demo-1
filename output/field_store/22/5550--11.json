She (or he, for the sex seems  uncertain), who had the \"body of a serpent and head of an ox\" (or a  human head and horns of an ox, according to some writers), \"moulded  yellow earth and made man.\" Ssu-ma Cheng, of the eighth century A.D.,  author of the _Historical Records_ and of another work on the three  great legendary emperors, Fu Hsi, Shen Nung, and Huang Ti, gives  the following account of her: \"Fu Hsi was succeeded by Nue Kua, who  like him had the surname Feng. Nue Kua had the body of a serpent and  a human head, with the virtuous endowments of a divine sage. Toward  the end of her reign there was among the feudatory princes Kung Kung,  whose functions were the administration of punishment. Violent and  ambitious, he became a rebel, and sought by the influence of water  to overcome that of wood [under which Nue Kua reigned]. He did battle  with Chu Jung [said to have been one of the ministers of Huang Ti,  and later the God of Fire], but was not victorious; whereupon he  struck his head against the Imperfect Mountain, Pu Chou Shan, and  brought it down. The pillars of Heaven were broken and the corners of  the earth gave way. Hereupon Nue Kua melted stones of the five colours  to repair the heavens, and cut off the feet of the tortoise to set  upright the four extremities of the earth. [7] Gathering the ashes  of reeds she stopped the flooding waters, and thus rescued the land  of Chi, Chi Chou [the early seat of the Chinese sovereignty].\"    Another account separates the name and makes Nue and Kua brother  and sister, describing them as the only two human beings in  existence. At the creation they were placed at the foot of the K'un-lun  Mountains. Then they prayed, saying, \"If thou, O God, hast sent us to  be man and wife, the smoke of our sacrifice will stay in one place;  but if not, it will be scattered.\" The smoke remained stationary.    But though Nue Kua is said to have moulded the first man (or the first  human beings) out of clay, it is to be noted that, being only the  successor of Fu Hsi, long lines of rulers had preceded her of whom no  account is given, and also that, as regards the heavens and the earth  at least, she is regarded as the repairer and not the creator of them.    Heaven-deaf (T'ien-lung) and Earth-dumb (Ti-ya), the two attendants  of Wen Ch'ang, the God of Literature (see following chapter), have  also been drawn into the cosmogonical net. From their union came the  heavens and the earth, mankind, and all living things.    These and other brief and unelaborated personal cosmogonies, even if  not to be regarded as spurious imitations, certainly have not become  established in the Chinese mind as the explanation of the way in which  the universe came to be: in this sphere the P'an Ku legend reigns  supreme; and, owing to its concrete, easily apprehensible nature,  has probably done so ever since the time of its invention.      Early Cosmogony Dualistic    The period before the appearance of the P'an Ku myth may be divided  into two parts; that from some early unknown date up to about the  middle of the Confucian epoch, say 500 B.C., and that from 500 B.C. to  A.D. 400. We know that during the latter period the minds of Chinese  scholars were frequently occupied with speculations as to the origin  of the universe. Before 500 B.C. we have no documentary remains  telling us what the Chinese believed about the origin of things;  but it is exceedingly unlikely that no theories or speculations at  all concerning the origin of themselves and their surroundings were  formed by this intelligent people during the eighteen centuries or  more which preceded the date at which we find the views held by them  put into written form. It is safe to assume that the dualism which  later occupied their philosophical thoughts to so great an extent  as almost to seem inseparable from them, and exercised so powerful  an influence throughout the course of their history, was not only  formulating itself during that long period, but had gradually reached  an advanced stage. We may even go so far as to say that dualism, or  its beginnings, existed in the very earliest times, for the belief in  the second self or ghost or double of the dead is in reality nothing  else. And we find it operating with apparently undiminished energy  after the Chinese mind had reached its maturity in the Sung dynasty.        The Canon of Changes    The Bible of Chinese dualism is the _I ching_, the _Canon of Changes_  (or _Permutations_). It is held in great veneration both on account  of its antiquity and also because of the \"unfathomable wisdom which  is supposed to lie concealed under its mysterious symbols.\" It is  placed first in the list of the classics, or Sacred Books, though  it is not the oldest of them. When exactly the work itself on which  the subsequent elaborations were founded was composed is not now  known. Its origin is attributed to the legendary emperor Fu Hsi  (2953-2838 B.C.). It does not furnish a cosmogony proper, but merely  a dualistic system as an explanation, or attempted explanation,  or even perhaps only a record, of the constant changes (in modern  philosophical language the \"redistribution of matter and motion\")  going on everywhere. That explanation or record was used for purposes  of divination. This dualistic system, by a simple addition, became  a monism, and at the same time furnished the Chinese with a cosmogony.      The Five Elements    The Five Elements or Forces (_wu hsing_)--which, according to  the Chinese, are metal, air, fire, water, and wood--are first  mentioned in Chinese literature in a chapter of the classic _Book  of History_. [8] They play a very important part in Chinese thought:  'elements' meaning generally not so much the actual substances as the  forces essential to human, life. They have to be noticed in passing,  because they were involved in the development of the cosmogonical  ideas which took place in the eleventh and twelfth centuries A.D.        Monism    As their imagination grew, it was natural that the Chinese should  begin to ask themselves what, if the _yang_ and the _yin_ by  their permutations produced, or gave shape to, all things, was it  that produced the _yang_ and the _yin_. When we see traces of this  inquisitive tendency we find ourselves on the borderland of dualism  where the transition is taking place into the realm of monism. But  though there may have been a tendency toward monism in early times, it  was only in the Sung dynasty that the philosophers definitely placed  behind the _yang_ and the _yin_ a First Cause--the Grand Origin,  Grand Extreme, Grand Terminus, or Ultimate Ground of Existence. [9]  They gave to it the name _t'ai chi_, and represented it by a concrete  sign, the symbol of a circle. The complete scheme shows the evolution  of the Sixty-four Diagrams (_kua_) from the _t'ai chi_ through the  _yang_ and the _yin_, the Four, Eight, Sixteen, and Thirty-two  Diagrams successively. This conception was the work of the Sung  philosopher Chou Tun-i (A.D. 1017-73), commonly known as Chou Tzu,  and his disciple Chu Hsi (A.D. 1130-1200), known as Chu Tzu or Chu  Fu Tzu, the famous historian and Confucian commentator--two of the  greatest names in Chinese philosophy. It was at this time that the  tide of constructive imagination in China, tinged though it always  was with classical Confucianism, rose to its greatest height. There  is the philosopher's seeking for causes. Yet in this matter of the  First Cause we detect, in the full flood of Confucianism, the potent  influence of Taoist and Buddhist speculations. It has even been said  that the Sung philosophy, which grew, not from the _I ching_ itself,  but from the appendixes to it, is more Taoistic than Confucian. As it  was with the P'an Ku legend, so was it with this more philosophical  cosmogony. The more fertile Taoist and Buddhist imaginations led to the  preservation of what the Confucianists, distrusting the marvellous,  would have allowed to die a natural death. It was, after all, the  mystical foreign elements which gave point to--we may rightly say  rounded off--the early dualism by converting it into monism, carrying  philosophical speculation from the Knowable to the Unknowable, and  furnishing the Chinese with their first scientific theory of the  origin, not of the changes going on in the universe (on which they  had already formed their opinions), but of the universe itself.      Chou Tzu's \"T'ai Chi T'u\"    Chou Tun-i, appropriately apotheosized as 'Prince in the Empire of  Reason,' completed and systematized the philosophical world-conception  which had hitherto obtained in the Chinese mind. He did not ask his  fellow-countrymen to discard any part of what they had long held in  high esteem: he raised the old theories from the sphere of science to  that of philosophy by unifying them and bringing them to a focus. And  he made this unification intelligible to the Chinese mind by his famous  _T'ai chi t'u_, or Diagram of the Great Origin (or Grand Terminus),  showing that the Grand Original Cause, itself uncaused, produces the  _yang_ and the _yin_, these the Five Elements, and so on, through  the male and female norms (_tao_), to the production of all things.      Chu Hsi's Monistic Philosophy    The writings of Chu Hsi, especially his treatise on _The Immaterial  Principle [li] and Primary Matter [ch'i]_, leave no doubt as to the  monism of his philosophy. In this work occurs the passage: \"In the  universe there exists no primary matter devoid of the immaterial  principle; and no immaterial principle apart from primary matter\";  and although the two are never separated \"the immaterial principle  [as Chou Tzu explains] is what is previous to form, while primary  matter is what is subsequent to form,\" the idea being that the two  are different"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15255"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 1 (#13)"],[1,"has commanded  the respect of the masses. It must command our respect too, even if it  is contrary to our temperament, for it is the persistent ideal of a  great nation and cannot be explained away as hallucination or  charlatanism. It is allied to the experiences of European mystics of  whom St Teresa is a striking example, though less saintly persons, such  as Walt Whitman and J.A. Symonds, might also be cited. Of such mysticism  William James said \"the existence of mystical states absolutely  overthrows the pretension of non-mystical states to be the sole and  ultimate dictators of what we may believe[48].\"    These mystical states are commonly described as meditation but they  include not merely peaceful contemplation but ecstatic rapture. They are  sometimes explained as union with Brahman[49], the absorption of the  soul in God, or its feeling that it is one with him. But this is  certainly not the only explanation of ecstasy given in India, for it is  recognized as real and beneficent by Buddhists and Jains. The same  rapture, the same sense of omniscience and of ability to comprehend the  scheme of things, the same peace and freedom are experienced by both  theistic and non-theistic sects, just as they have also been experienced  by Christian mystics. The experiences are real but they do not depend on  the presence of any special deity, though they may be coloured by the  theological views of individual thinkers[50]. The earliest Buddhist  texts make right rapture (samma samadhi) the end and crown of the  eight-fold path but offer no explanation of it. They suggest that it is  something wrought by the mind for itself and without the co-operation or  infusion of any external influence.      13.    Indian ideas about the destiny of the soul are connected with equally  important views about its nature. I will not presume to say what is the  definition of the soul in European philosophy but in the language of  popular religion it undoubtedly means that which remains when a body is  arbitrarily abstracted from a human personality, without enquiring how  much of that personality is thinkable without a material substratum.  This popular soul includes mind, perception and desire and often no  attempt is made to distinguish it from them. But in India it is so  distinguished. The soul (atman or purusha) _uses_ the mind and senses:  they are its instruments rather than parts of it. Sight, for instance,  serves as the spectacles of the soul, and the other senses and even the  mind (manas) which is an intellectual _organ_ are also instruments. If  we talk of a soul passing from death to another birth, this according to  most Hindus is a soul accompanied by its baggage of mind and senses, a  subtle body indeed, but still gaseous not spiritual. But what is the  soul by itself? When an English poet sings of death that it is \"Only the  sleep eternal in an eternal night\" or a Greek poet calls it [Greek:  atermona negreton hupnon] we feel that they are denying immortality. But  Indian divines maintain that deep sleep is one of the states in which  the soul approaches nearest to God: that it is a state of bliss, and is  unconscious not because consciousness is suspended but because no  objects are presented to it. Even higher than dreamless sleep is another  condition known simply as the fourth state[51], the others being waking,  dream-sleep and dreamless sleep. In this fourth state thought is one  with the object of thought and, knowledge being perfect, there exists no  contrast between knowledge and ignorance. All this sounds strange to  modern Europe. We are apt to say that dreamless sleep is simply  unconsciousness[52] and that the so-called fourth state is imaginary or  unmeaning. But to follow even popular speculation in India it is  necessary to grasp this truth, or assumption, that when discursive  thought ceases, when the mind and the senses are no longer active, the  result is not unconsciousness equivalent to non-existence but the  highest and purest state of the soul, in which, rising above thought and  feeling, it enjoys the untrammelled bliss of its own nature[53].    If these views sound mysterious and fanciful, I would ask those  Europeans who believe in the immortality of the soul what, in their  opinion, survives death. The brain, the nerves and the sense organs  obviously decay: the soul, you may say, is not a product of them, but  when they are destroyed or even injured, perceptive and intellectual  processes are inhibited and apparently rendered impossible. Must not  that which lives for ever be, as the Hindus think, independent of  thought and of sense-impressions?    I have observed in my reading that European philosophers are more ready  to talk about soul and spirit than to define them[54] and the same is  true of Indian philosophers. The word most commonly rendered by soul is  _atman_[55] but no one definition can be given for it, for some hold  that the soul is identical with the Universal Spirit, others that it is  merely of the same nature, still others that there are innumerable souls  uncreate and eternal, while the Buddhists deny the existence of a soul  _in toto_. But most Hindus who believe in the existence of an atman or  soul agree in thinking that it is the real self and essence of all human  beings (or for that matter of other beings): that it is eternal _a parte  ante_ and _a parte post_: that it is not subject to variation but passes  unchanged from one birth to another: that youth and age, joy and sorrow,  and all the accidents of human life are affections, not so much of the  soul as of the envelopes and limitations which surround it during its  pilgrimage: that the soul, if it can be released and disengaged from  these envelopes, is in itself knowledge and bliss, knowledge meaning the  immediate and intuitive knowledge of God. A proper comprehension of this  point of view will make us chary of labelling Indian thought as  pessimistic on the ground that it promises the soul something which we  are inclined to call unconsciousness.    In studying oriental religions sympathy and a desire to agree if  possible are the first requisites. For instance, he who says of a  certain ideal \"this means annihilation and I do not like it\" is on the  wrong way. The right way is to ascertain what many of our most  intelligent brothers mean by the cessation of mental activity and why it  is for them an ideal.      14. _Eastern Pessimism and Renunciation_    But the charge of pessimism against Eastern religions is so important  that we must consider other aspects of it, for though the charge is  wrong, it is wrong only because those who bring it do not use quite the  right word. And indeed it would be hard to find the right word in a  European language. The temperament and theory described as pessimism are  European. They imply an attitude of revolt, a right to judge and  grumble. Why did the Deity make something out of nothing? What was his  object? But this is not the attitude of Eastern thought: it generally  holds that we cannot imagine nothing: that the world process is without  beginning or end and that man must learn how to make the best of it.    The Far East purged Buddhism of much of its pessimism. There we see that  the First Truth about suffering is little more than an admission of the  existence of evil, which all religions and common sense admit. Evil  ceases in the saint: nirvana in this life is perfect happiness. And  though striving for the material improvement of the world is not held up  conspicuously as an ideal in the Buddhist scriptures (or for that matter  in the New Testament), yet it is never hinted that good effort is vain.  A king should be a good king.    Renunciation is a great word in the religions of both Europe and Asia,  but in Europe it is almost active. Except to advanced mystics, it means  abandoning a natural attitude and deliberately assuming another which it  is difficult to maintain. Something similar is found in India in the  legends of those ascetics who triumphed over the flesh until they become  very gods in power[56]. But it is also a common view in the East that he  who renounces ambition and passion is not struggling against the world  and the devil but simply leading a natural life. His passions indeed  obey his will and do not wander here and there according to their fancy,  but his temperament is one of acquiescence not resistance. He takes his  place among the men, beasts and plants around him and ceasing to  struggle finds that his own soul contains happiness in itself.    Most Europeans consider man as the centre and lord of the world or, if  they are very religious, as its vice-regent under God. He may kill or  otherwise maltreat animals for his pleasure or convenience: his task is  to subdue the forces of nature: nature is subservient to him and to his  destinies: without man nature is meaningless. Much the same view was  held by the ancient Greeks and in a less acute form by the Jews and  Romans. Swinburne's line      Glory to man in the highest, for man is the master of things    is overbold for professing Christians but it expresses both the modern  scientific sentiment and the ancient Hellenic sentiment.    But such a line of poetry would I think be impossible in India or in any  country to the East of it. There man is thought of as a part of nature  not its centre or master[57]. Above him are formidable hosts of deities  and spirits, and even European engineers cannot subdue the genii of the  flood and typhoon: below but still not separated from him are the  various tribes of birds and beasts. A good man does not kill them for  pleasure nor eat flesh, and even those whose aspirations to virtue are  modest treat animals as humble brethren rather than as lower creatures  over whom they have dominion by divine command.    This attitude is illustrated by Chinese and Japanese art. In  architecture, this art makes it a principle that palaces "]]]
