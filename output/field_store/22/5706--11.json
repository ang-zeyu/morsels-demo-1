The crew were divided in two parts: one  worked at the huts and the other explored the country, returning every  night to the camp. From the wild vines found by the foragers, the whole  district was called Vinland, and samples of these, enough to fill the  stern boat, and of the trees and \"self-sown wheat\" found in the fields  were taken back to Eric's Fiord. Thereafter Leif was called the Lucky,  and got much wealth and fame, but Thorwald Ericson, his brother, thought  he had not explored enough, and \"determined to be talked about\" even  more than the first settler of Vinland.    He put to sea with thirty men and came straight to Leif's Booths in  Vinland, where he stayed the winter. On the first signs of spring  Thorwald ordered his vessel to be rigged, and sent his longboat on  ahead to explore.    All alike thought the land beautiful and well-wooded; they noticed that  the distance was small between the forest and the sea, that the beach  was all of white sand, and that there were many islands off the shore  and very shallow water; but they saw no trace of man or beast, except a  wooden corn-barn on an island far to the west. After coasting all the  summer they came back in the autumn to the booths.    The next spring Thorwald went eastwards, and \"towards the north along  the land they drove upon a cape and broke their keel and stayed long to  repair, and called the place Keel-Ness (Kjalarness) from this.\" Then  they sailed away eastwards along the country, everywhere thickly wooded,  till at one place Thorwald drew up his ships to the land and laid out  gangways to the shore, saying, \"I would gladly set up my farm here.\"    But now they came upon the first traces of other men; far off upon the  white sandy beach three specks were sighted--three skin boats of the  Skraelings or Esquimaux, with three men hiding under each. Thorwald's men  captured and killed eight of them, but one escaped \"to where within the  fiord were several dwellings like little lumps on the ground.\" A heavy  drowsiness now fell upon the Norsemen, in the Saga, till a \"sudden  scream came to them, and a countless host from up the fiord came in skin  boats and laid themselves alongside.\"    The Vikings put up their shield-wall along the gunwale and kept off the  arrows of the Esquimaux till they had shot them all away, and \"fled off  as fast as they could,\" leaving Thorwald with a mortal wound under the  arm. He had time just to bid his men \"carry him to the point he had  wished to dwell at, for it was true that he would stay there awhile, but  with a cross at head and feet; and so died and was buried as he had  said.\" The place was called Crossness from the dead chief, but the crew  stayed all the winter and loaded the ship with vines and grapes, and in  the spring came back to Eric in Greenland.    And now, after the first mishap, discovery became more serious--not to  be undertaken but by strong and well-armed fleets. It was this that  checked the expansion of these Arctic colonies; at their best they were  too small to do more than hold their own against nature and the Skraeling  savages in their tiny settlements along the coast, where the ice-fields  have long since pushed man slowly but surely into the sea, with his  painfully won patches of hay and corn and pasturage.    But the colonists would never say die till they were utterly worn out;  now they only roused themselves to conquer the new lands they had found,  and found disputed.    First a third son of Red Eric, Thorstein, bethought him to go to Vinland  for his brother Thorwald's body. He put to sea and lost all sight of  land, beating about in the ocean the whole summer, till he came back to  Greenland in the first week of winter. (1004-6.)    He was followed by the greatest of the Vinland sailors, Thorfinn  Karlsefne, who really took in hand the founding of a new settlement over  the Western Sea. He came from Norway to Iceland soon after Thorwald's  death in 1004, passed on to Greenland about 1005, \"when, as before, much  was talked about a Vinland voyage,\" and in 1006 made ready to start with  one hundred and sixty men and five women, in three ships. They had with  them all kinds of cattle, meaning to settle in the land if they could,  and they made an agreement, Karlsefne and his people, that each should  have an equal share in the gain. Leif lent them his houses in Vinland,  \"for he would not give them outright,\" and they sailed first to  Helluland (Labrador), where they found a quantity of foxes, then to  Markland, well-stocked with forest animals, then to an island at the  mouth of a fiord, unknown before, covered with eyder ducks. They called  the new discoveries Stream Island and Stream Fiord, from the current  that here ran out into the sea, and sent off a party of eight men, in  search of Vinland, in a stern boat. This was driven by westerly gales  back to Iceland, but Thorfinn, with the rest, sailed south till he came  to Leif Ericson's \"river that fell into the sea from a lake, with  islands lying off the mouth of the stream, low grounds covered with  wheat growing wild, and rising grounds clad with vines.\"    Here they settled, re-named the country \"Hope, from the good hope they  had of it,\" and began to fell the wood, to pasture their cattle in the  upland, and to gather the grapes.    After the first winter the Skraelings came upon them, at first to traffic  with furs and sables against milk and dairy produce, and then to fight;  for as neither understood the other, and the natives tried to force  their way into Thorfinn's houses, and to get hold of his men's weapons,  a quarrel was bound to come.    Fearing this, Karlsefne put a fence round the settlement and made all  ready for battle, \"and at this very time was a child born to him in the  village, called Snorre, of Gudrid his wife, the widow of Thorstein  Eric-son, whom he had brought with him.\" Then the Esquimaux came down  upon them, \"many more than before, and there was a battle, and  Thorfinn's men won the day and saved the cattle,\" and their enemies fled  into the forest.    Thorfinn stayed all the winter, but towards spring he grew tired of his  enterprise, and returned to Greenland, \"taking much goods,\" vines, wood  for timber, and skin-wares, and so came back to Eric's Fiord in the  summer of 1008.    Thus ends the story of the last serious effort to colonise Vinland, and  the Saga, while giving no definite cause for this failure upon failure,  seems to show that even the trifling annoyance of the Skraelings was  enough to turn the scale. Natural difficulties were so immense, men were  so few, that a pigmy enemy had all the power of the last straw in a  load, the odd man in a council. The actual resistance of American  natives to European colonists was never very serious in any part of the  continent, but the distance from the starting-point and the  difficulties of life in the new country were able, even in the time of  Raleigh and De Soto, to keep in check men who far more readily founded  and kept up European empires in the Indian seas.    So now, though on Thorfinn's return the \"talk began to turn again upon a  Vinland voyage, as both gainful and honourable,\" and a daughter of Red  Eric, named Freydis, talked men over--especially two brothers, Helge and  Finnboge--to a fresh attempt in the country where all the House of Eric  had tried and failed; though Leif lent his booths as before, and sixty  able-bodied men, besides women, were found willing to go, the colony  could never be firmly planted. Freydis and her allies sailed in 1011,  reached the settlement, which was now for the third time recolonised,  and wintered there;--but jealousies soon broke up the camp, Helge and  Finnboge were murdered with all their followers, and the rest came back  in 1013 to Greenland, \"where Thorfinn Karlsefne was just ready for  sailing back to Norway, and it was common talk that never did a richer  ship leave Eric's Fiord than that which he steered.\" It was that same  Karlsefne who gave the fullest account of all his travels, concludes the  Saga, but whether Thorfinn ever returned to Vinland, whether there were  any more attempts to settle at Leif's Booths or elsewhere, whether the  account we have of these voyages is really an Eric Saga, only telling  the deeds of Red Eric and his House--for after Bjarni, almost every  Vinland leader is of this family--we cannot tell. We can only fancy that  all these suggestions are probable, by the side of the few additional  facts known to the Norse Skalds or Bards. The first of these is, that in  983-4, Are Marson of Reykianes in Iceland was driven by storms far West  to White Man's Land, where he was followed by Bjarni Asbrandson in 999,  and by Gudleif Gudlangson in 1029. This was the tale of his friend Rafn,  \"the Limerick trader,\" and of Are Frode, his great-great-grandson, who  called the unknown land Great Ireland.[17] True or untrue, in whatever  way, this would be a later discovery than those of Eric and his sons, if  the news of it did not come into Iceland or Norway till after Thorfinn  Karlsefne's voyage, as is generally supposed. Again, the length of the  voyage is a difficulty, and the whole matter has a doubtful look--an  attempt to start a rival to the Eric Saga, by a far more brilliant  success a few years earlier.    [Footnote 17: By some supposed to be S. Carolina, by others the  Canaries.]    We seem to be on more certain ground in our next and last chapter of  Viking exploration in the north-west, in the fragmentary notices of  Greenland and Vinland voyages to the middle of the fourteenth century,  and in the fairly clear and continuous account of the two Greenland  settlements of the western and the eastern Bays.    We hear, for instance, of Bishop Eric going over from Eric's Fiord to  Vinland in 1121; of clergy from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18767"],[0,"Stories about Animals: with Pictures to Match (#13)"],[1,"lion, to pull out his tongue, and even to chastise him without  cause. He seems to bear it all with the utmost composure; and we very  rarely have instances of his revenging these unprovoked sallies of  cruelty. However, when his anger is at last excited, the consequences  are terrible. Labat tells us of a gentleman who kept a lion in his  chamber, and employed a servant to attend it, who, as is usual, mixed  blows with his caresses. This state of things continued for some time,  till one morning the gentleman was awakened by a noise in his room,  which at first he could not tell the cause of; but, drawing the  curtains, he perceived a horrid spectacle--the lion growling over the  man's head, which he had separated from the body, and tossing it round  the floor! He immediately flew into the next apartment, called to the  people without, and had the animal secured from doing further mischief.    We are told of the combat of a lion and a wild boar, in a meadow near  Algiers, which continued for a long time with incredible obstinacy. At  last, both were seen to fall by the wounds they had given each other;  and the ground all about them was covered with their blood. These  instances, however, are rare; the lion is in general undisputed master  of the forest.    It was once customary for those who were unable to pay sixpence for the  sight of the wild beasts in the tower of London, to bring a dog or a  cat, as a gift to the beasts, in lieu of money to the keeper. Among  others, a man had brought a pretty black spaniel, which was thrown into  the cage of the great lion. Immediately the little animal trembled and  shivered, crouched, and threw himself on his back, put forth his tongue,  and held up his paws, as if praying for mercy. In the mean time, the  lion, instead of devouring him, turned him over with one paw, and then  with the other. He smelled of him, and seemed desirous of courting a  further acquaintance. The keeper, on seeing this, brought a large mess  of his own family dinner. But the lion kept aloof, and refused to eat,  keeping his eye on the dog, and inviting him, as it were, to be his  taster. At length, the little animal's fears being somewhat abated, and  his appetite quickened by the smell of the food, he approached slowly,  and, with trembling, ventured to eat. The lion then advanced gently, and  began to partake, and they finished their meal very quietly together.    From this day, a strict friendship commenced between them, consisting of  great affection and tenderness on the part of the lion, and the utmost  confidence and boldness on the part of the dog; insomuch that he would  lay himself down to sleep, within the fangs and under the jaws of his  terrible patron. In about twelve months the little spaniel sickened and  died. For a time the lion did not appear to conceive otherwise than that  his favorite was asleep. He would continue to smell of him, and then  would stir him with his nose, and turn him over with his paws. But  finding that all his efforts to wake him were vain, he would traverse  his cage from end to end, at a swift and uneasy pace. He would then  stop, and look down upon him with a fixed and drooping regard, and again  lift up his head, and roar for several minutes, as the sound of distant  thunder. They attempted, but in vain, to convey the carcass from him.  The keeper then endeavored to tempt him with a variety of food, but he  turned from all that was offered, with loathing. They then put several  living dogs in his cage, which he tore in pieces, but left their  carcasses on the floor. His passions being thus inflamed, he would  grapple at the bars of his cage, as if enraged at his restraint from  tearing those around him to pieces. Again, as if quite spent, he would  stretch himself by the remains of his beloved associate, lay his paws  upon him, and take him to his bosom; and then utter his grief in deep  and melancholy roaring, for the loss of his little play-fellow. For five  days he thus languished, and gradually declined, without taking any  sustenance or admitting any comfort, till, one morning, he was found  dead, with his head reclined on the carcass of his little friend. They  were both interred together.    A lion, when about three months old, was caught in the forests of  Senegal, and tamed by the director of the African company in that  colony. He became unusually tractable and gentle. He slept in company  with cats, dogs, geese, monkeys, and other animals, and never offered  any violence to them. When he was about eight months old, he formed an  attachment to a terrier dog, and this attachment increased afterward to  such an extent, that the lion was seldom happy in the absence of his  companion. At the age of fourteen months, the lion, with the dog in  company, was transported to France. He showed so little ferocity on  shipboard, that he was allowed at all times to have the liberty of  walking about the vessel. When he was landed at Havre, he was conducted  with only a cord attached to his collar, and attended by his favorite  play-fellow, to Versailles. Soon after their arrival, the dog died, when  the lion became so disconsolate, that it was found necessary to put  another dog into his den. This dog, terrified at the sight of such an  animal, endeavored to conceal himself; and the lion, surprised at the  noise, killed him by a stroke with one of his paws.    M. Felix, some years since the keeper of the national menagerie at  Paris, added two lions to the collection, a male and a female. He had  become endeared to them by kind treatment, so that scarcely any one else  could control them, and they manifested their regard in a great many  ways. The gentleman, however, was taken very sick, and was confined for  some time to his bed. Another person was necessarily intrusted with the  care of these lions. From the moment that M. Felix left, the male sat,  sad and solitary, at the end of his cage, and refused to take food from  the hands of the stranger, for whom, it was evident, he entertained no  little dislike. The company of the female seemed to displease him. In a  short time he became so uneasy, that no one dared to approach him. By  and by, however, his old master recovered, and with the intention of  surprising the animal, he crept softly to the cage, and showed only his  face between the bars. But the male lion knew him at once. He leaped  against the bars, patted him with his paws, licked his hands and face,  and actually trembled with pleasure. The female also ran to him; but the  other drove her back, and was on the point of quarreling with her, so  jealous was he lest she should receive any of the favors of M. Felix.  Afterward, however, the keeper entered the cage, caressed them both by  turns, and pacified them.    Sir George Davis, who was English consul at Naples about the middle of  the seventeenth century, happening on one occasion to be in Florence,  visited the menagerie of the grand duke. At the farther end of one of  the dens he saw a lion which lay in sullen majesty, and which the  keepers informed him they had been unable to tame, although every effort  had been used for upward of three years. Sir George had no sooner  reached the gate of the den, than the lion ran to it, and evinced every  demonstration of joy and transport. The animal reared himself up, purred  like a cat when pleased, and licked the hand of Sir George, which he had  put through the bars. The keeper was astonished and frightened for the  safety of his visitor, entreated him not to trust an apparent fit of  phrensy, with which the animal seemed to be seized; for he was, without  exception, the most fierce and sullen of his tribe which he had ever  seen. This, however, had no effect on Sir George, who, notwithstanding  every entreaty on the part of the keeper, insisted on entering the  lion's den. The moment he got in, the delighted lion threw his paws upon  his shoulders, licked his face, and ran about him, rubbing his head on  Sir George, purring and fawning like a cat when expressing its affection  for its master. This occurrence became the talk of Florence, and reached  the ears of the grand duke, who sent for Sir George, and requested an  interview at the menagerie, that he might witness so extraordinary a  circumstance, when Sir George gave the following explanation: \"A captain  of a ship from Barbary gave me this lion, when quite a whelp. I brought  him up tame; but when I thought him too large to be suffered to run  about the house, I built a den for him in my court-yard. From that time  he was never permitted to be loose, except when brought to the house to  be exhibited to my friends. When he was five years old, he did some  mischief by pawing and playing with people in his frolicsome moods.  Having griped a man one day a little too hard, I ordered him to be shot,  for fear of myself incurring the guilt of what might happen. On this a  friend, who happened to be then at dinner with me, begged him as a  present. How he came here, I do not know.\" The Grand Duke of Tuscany, on  hearing his story, said it was the very same person who had presented  him with the lion.    [Illustration: THE LIONESS AND HER CUBS.]    Part of a ship's crew being sent ashore on the coast of India for the  purpose of cutting wood, the curiosity of one of the men having led him  to stray to a considerable distance from his companions, he was much  alarmed by the appearance of a large lioness, who made toward him; but,  on her coming up, his fear was allayed, by her lying down at his feet,  and looking very earnestly, first in his face, and then at a tree some  little distance off. After repeating these looks several times, she  arose, and proceeded toward the tree, looking back, as if she wished the  sailor to follow her. At length he ventured, and, coming to the tree,  perceived a huge baboon, with two young cubs in her arms, which he  immediately supposed to be those of the"]]]
