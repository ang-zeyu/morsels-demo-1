EXERCISES.--Relate the story of the \"Old Eagle Tree.\" What lesson was  taught the boy who watched the eagle's actions?        XXXI. ALPINE SONG. (88)  William W. Story, the author, was born in Salem, Mass.,    In 1819. His writings in poetry and prose are well known, and he also  gained distinction in his profession as a sculptor. He died in 1895.    1. With alpenstock and knapsack light,       I wander o'er hill and valley;     I climb the snow peak's flashing height,       And sleep in the sheltered chalet,--     Free in heart--happy and free--     This is the summer life for me.    2. The city's dust I leave behind       For the keen, sweet air of the mountain,     The grassy path by the wild rose lined,       The gush of the living fountain,--     Free in heart--happy and free--     This is the summer life for me.    3. High above me snow clouds rise,       In the early morning gleaming;     And the patterned valley beneath me lies       Softly in sunshine dreaming,--     Free in heart--happy and free--     This is the summer life for me.    4. The bells of wandering herds I list,       Chiming in upland meadows;     How sweet they sound, as I lie at rest       Under the dark pine shadows--     Glad in heart--happy and free--     This is the summer life for me.      DEFINITIONS.--l. Al'pen-stock, a long staff, pointed with iron, used in  traveling among the Alps. Knap'sack, a leather sack for carrying food or  clothing, borne on the back. Cha-let' (pro. sha-la'), a mountain hut. 2.  Gush, a rapid outflowing. 3. Pat'terned, marked off in figures or  patterns. 4. List, hearken to.        XXXII. CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER CASES. (89)    1. Derby. Good morning, neighbor Scrapewell. I have half a dozen miles to  ride to-day, and shall be extremely obliged if you will lend me your gray  mare.    2. Scrapewell. It would give me great pleasure to oblige you, friend  Derby; but I am under the necessity of going to the mill this very  morning, with a bag of corn. My wife wants the meal to-day, and you know  what a time there'll be if I disappoint her.    3. D. Then she must want it still, for I can assure you the mill does not  go to-day. I heard the miller tell Will Davis that the water was too low.    4. S. You don't say so! That is bad, indeed; for in that case I shall be  obliged to gallop off to town for the meal. My wife would comb my head for  me if I should neglect it.    5. D. I can save you this journey, for I have plenty of meal at home, and  will lend your wife as much as she wants.    6. S. Ah! neighbor Derby, I am sure your meal would never suit my wife.  You can't conceive how whimsical she is.    7. D. If she were ten times more whimsical than she is, I  am certain she would like it; for you sold it to me yourself,  and you assured me it was the best you ever had.    8. S. Yes, yes! that's true, indeed; I always have the best of  everything. You know, neighbor Derby, that no one is more  ready to oblige a friend than I am; but I must tell you the  mare this morning refused to eat hay; and, truly, I am afraid  she will not carry you.    9. D. Oh, never fear! I will feed her well with oats on the road.    10.  S. Oats! neighbor; oats are very dear.    11. D. Never mind that. When I have a good job in view, I never stand for  trifles.    12. S. But it is very slippery; and I am really afraid she will fall and  break your neck.    13. D. Give yourself no uneasiness about that. The mare is certainly  sure-footed; and, besides, you were just now talking of galloping her to  town.    14. S. Well, then, to tell you the plain truth, though I wish to oblige  you with all my heart, my saddle is torn quite in pieces, and I have just  sent my bridle to be mended.    15. D. Luckily, I have both a bridle and a saddle hanging up at home.    16. S. Ah! that may be; but I am sure your saddle will never fit my mare.  She's very notional.    17. D. Why, then I'll borrow neighbor Clodpole's.    18. S. Clodpole's! his will no more fit than yours.    19. D. At the worst, then, I will go to my good friend, Squire Jones. He  has half a score of them; and I am sure he will lend me one that will fit  her.    20. S. You know, friend Derby, that no one is more willing to oblige his  neighbors than I am. I do assure you the beast should be at your service,  with all my heart; but she has not been curried, I believe, for three  weeks past. Her foretop and mane want combing and cutting very much. If  anyone should see her in her present plight, it would ruin the sale of  her.    21. D. Oh, a horse is soon curried, and my son Sam shall attend to it at  once.    22. S. Yes, very likely; but I this moment recollect the creature has no  shoes on.    23. D. Well, is there not a blacksmith hard by?    24. S. What, that tinker, Dobson? I would not trust such a bungler to  shoe a goat. No, no; none but uncle Tom Thumper shall shoe my mare.    25. D. As good luck will have it, then, I shall pass right by his door.    26. S. [Calling to his son.] Tim, Tim! here's neighbor Derby, who wants  the loan of the gray mare, to ride to town to-day. You know the skin was  rubbed off her back, last week, a hand's breadth or more. [Gives Tim a  wink.] However, I believe she is well enough by this time. You know, Tim,  how ready I am to oblige my neighbors; indeed, we ought to do all the good  we can in this world. We must certainly let neighbor Derby have her if she  will possibly answer his purpose. Yes, yes; I see plainly by Tim's  countenance, neighbor Derby, that he's disposed to oblige you. I would not  have refused you the mare for the worth of her. If I had, I should have  expected you to refuse me in turn. None of my neighbors can accuse me of  being backward in doing them a kindness whenever it is possible. Come,  Tim, what do you say?    27. Tim. What do I say, father? Why, sir, I say that I am no less ready  than you are to do a neighborly kindness. But the mare is by no means  capable of performing the journey. About a hand's breadth, did you say?  Why, sir, the skin is torn from the poor creature's back the bigness of  your broad-brimmed hat! And, besides, I have promised her, so soon as she  is able to travel, to Ned Saunders, to carry a load of apples to market.    28. S. Do you hear that, neighbor? I am very sorry matters are thus. I  would not have disobliged you for the price of two such mares. Believe me,  neighbor Derby, I am really sorry, for your sake, that matters turn out  thus.    29. D. And I as much for yours, neighbor Scrapewell; for to tell you the  truth I received a letter this morning from Mr. Griffin, who tells me if I  will be in town to-day he will give me the refusal of all that lot of  timber, which he is about cutting down, on the side of the hill; and I had  intended you should have shared half of it, which would have been not less  than fitly dollars in your pocket. But, as your--    30.  S. Fifty dollars, did you say?    31. D. Ay, truly, did I; but as your mare is out of order, I'll go and see  if I can get old Roan, the blacksmith's horse.    32. S. Old Roan! My mare is at your service, neighbor, Here, Tim, tell Ned  Saunders he can't have the mare: neighbor Derby wants her; and I won't  refuse so good a friend anything he asks for.    33. D. But what are you to do for meal?    34. S. My wife can do without it for a week if you want the mare so long.    35. D. But, then, your saddle is all in pieces.    36. S. I meant the old one. I have bought a new one since, and you shall  have the first use of it.    37. D. And shall I call at Thumper's and get the mare shod?    38. S. No, no; I had forgotten to tell you that I let neighbor Dobson shoe  her, last week, by way of trial; and, to do him justice, he shoes  extremely well.    39. D. But, if the poor creature has lost so much skin from off her back--    40. S. Poh, poh! That is just one of Tim's large stories. I do assure you  it was not, at first, bigger than my thumb nail, and I am certain it has  not grown any since.    41. D. At least, however, let her have something she will eat, since she  refuses hay.    42. S. She did, indeed, refuse hay this morning; but the only reason was  that she was crammed full of oats. You have nothing to fear, neighbor; the  mare is in perfect trim; and she will skim you over the ground like a  bird. I wish you a good journey and a profitable job.      DEFINITIONS.--l. Ex-treme'ly, very much. 6. Whim'si-cal, full of whims.  20. Cur'ried, cleaned. Fore'top, hair on the forepart of the head. 24.  Bun'gler, a clumsy workman. 26. Dis-posed', inclined to, Back'ward, slow,  unwilling. 27. Ca'pa-ble, possessing ability. Per-form'ing, accomplishing.  29. Re-fus'al, choice of tak-ing. 42. Crammed, stuffed.        XXXIII. THE NOBLEST REVENGE. (94)    1. \"I will have revenge on him, that I will, and make him heartily repent  it,\" said Philip to himself, with a countenance quite red with anger. His  mind was so engaged that he did not see Stephen, who happened at that  instant to meet him.    2. \"Who is that,\" said Stephen, \"on whom you intend to be revenged?\"  Philip, as if awakened from a dream, stopped short, and looking at his  friend, soon resumed a smile that was natural to his countenance. \"Ah,\"  said he, \"you remember my bamboo, a very pretty cane which was given me by  my father, do you not? Look! there it is in pieces. It was farmer  Robinson's son who reduced it to this worthless state.\"    3. Stephen very coolly asked him what had induced young Robinson to break  it. \"I was walking peaceably along,\" replied he, \"and was playing with my  cane by twisting it round my body. By accident, one of the ends slipped  out of my hand, when I was opposite the gate, just by the wooden bridge,  where the ill natured fellow had put down a pitcher of water, which he was  taking home from the well.\"    4. \"It so happened that my cane, in springing back, upset the pitcher, but  did not break it. He came up close to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14883"],[0,"Grandmother Elsie (#13)"],[1,"attend to you,\" said Mr. Dinsmore.    The doctor was speaking aside to Donald and Solon.    Coming back, \"We will have a litter ready in a few moments,\" he said,  \"and carry you over to Ion.\"    \"By all means,\" said Mr. Dinsmore. \"You accompany us, of course, Arthur?\"    \"Certainly, sir.\"    \"How is she--the old negress? Was she much injured by the fall?\" Captain  Raymond asked.    No one could tell him, and he begged the doctor to attend to her while the  litter was preparing.    Arthur went in search of her, and presently returned, saying she had  escaped without any broken bones, though apparently a good deal shaken up  and bruised.          CHAPTER IX.        \"Man proposes, but God disposes.\"      Donald left Ion the next morning, going away sadly and alone, yet trying  to be truly thankful that his friend's injuries, though severe, were not  permanent, and that he left him where he would have the best of medical  treatment and nursing.    \"Don't be uneasy about the captain,\" Mr. Dinsmore said in parting; \"I can  assure you that Arthur is a skilful physician and surgeon, and we have  several negro women who thoroughly understand nursing. Beside my wife,  Elsie and I will oversee them and do all in our power for the comfort and  restoration of the invalid.\"    \"Thank you, cousin. I am sure nothing will be left undone that skill and  kindness can do,\" Donald said, shaking with warmth the hand Mr. Dinsmore  held out to him. \"Raymond is one in a thousand. I've known him for years,  and he has been a good and valuable friend to me. I wish it were possible  for me to stay and wait on him myself; but army men are not their own  masters, you know. He'll be wanting to get back to his ship before he's  able. Don't let him.\"    \"Not if I can prevent it,\" was Mr. Dinsmore's laughing rejoinder. \"By the  way, should not some word be sent to his wife?\"    \"Wife! She has been dead some two years, I think. I asked him if there was  any relative he would wish informed of his condition, and he said no; his  parents were not living, he had neither brother nor sister, and his  children were too young to be troubled about it.\"    \"Poor fellow!\" ejaculated Mr. Dinsmore, thinking of his own happier  lot--the sweet wife and daughter at Ion, the other daughter and son,  father, sisters, grandchildren and nephews who would flock about him in  tender solicitude, were he laid low by sickness or accident.    Leaving Donald in the city, he drove back to Ion full of sympathy for his  injured guest and admiration for his courage and fortitude; for he had  made no moan or complaint, though evidently suffering great pain and much  solicitude on account of the long prospective detention from official  duty.    The doctor's verdict was, a week or more in bed, probably six weeks before  the ankle could be used.    \"You must get me up much sooner than that, doctor, if it be a possible  thing,\" Captain Raymond said most emphatically.    \"I can only promise to do my best,\" was Arthur's response. \"Nature must  have time for her work of recuperation.\"    Elsie met her father in the entrance hall on his return. \"Ah, papa,\" she  said, looking up smilingly into his face, \"I think you will have to  rescind your order.\"    \"In regard to what?\" he asked, stopping to lay a hand lightly on her  shoulder, while he smoothed her hair caressingly with the other.    \"The week of entire rest you bade me take.\"    \"No; there is to be no recall of that order.\"    \"But our poor injured guest, father? injured in the noble effort to save  the life of another!\"    \"He shall have every care and attention without any assistance from you;  or Rose either; at least for the present.\"    \"But, dear papa, to have you worn out and made ill would be worse than  anything else.\"    \"That does not follow as an inevitable consequence, and you may safely  trust me to take excellent care of number one,\" he said, with playful look  and tone.    \"Ah, papa, there is not the least use in your trying to make me believe  there is any selfishness in you!\"    \"No, I presume not; you have always been persistently blind to my many  imperfections. Well, daughter, you need not be troubled lest I should  waste too much strength on the poor captain. I do not imagine him to be an  exacting person, and we have enough efficient nurses among the servants to  do all the work that is needful. My part will be, I think, principally to  cheer him, keep up his spirits, and see that he is provided with  everything that can contribute to comfort of mind and body. I must leave  you now and go to him. I advise a drive for you and your mamma as soon as  you can make ready for it; the air is delightfully clear and bracing.\"    \"Thank you, papa; the advice shall be followed immediately so far as I am  concerned, and the order carefully obeyed,\" she answered, as he moved on  down the hall.    The smile with which the captain greeted Mr. Dinsmore's entrance into the  room where he lay in pain and despondency was a rather melancholy one.    \"My dear sir, I feel for you!\" Mr. Dinsmore said, seating himself by the  bedside, \"but you are a brave man and a Christian, and can endure hardness  as a good soldier of Jesus Christ!\"    There was a flash of joy in the sufferer's eyes as he turned them upon the  speaker, \"That, sir, is the most comforting and sustaining thing you  could have said to me! Through what suffering was the Captain of our  salvation made perfect! And shall I shrink from enduring a little in His  service? Ah no! And when I reflect that I might have been killed, and my  dear children left fatherless, I feel that I have room for nothing but  thankfulness that it is as well with me as it is.\"    \"And that some good will be brought out of this trial we cannot doubt,\"  Mr. Dinsmore said; \"for 'we know that all things work together for good to  them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose.'\"    \"Yes; and 'I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not  worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.' 'We  glory in tribulation also, knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and  patience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed;  because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost  which is given unto us.'\"    \"What a wonderful book the Bible is!\" remarked Mr. Dinsmore meditatively;  \"what stores of comfort and encouragement it contains for all in whatever  state or condition! 'The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands  of gold and silver.'\"    \"Yes; how true it is, Mr. Dinsmore, that 'it is not in man that walketh to  direct his steps'! I had so fully resolved to return to-day to my vessel,  and now when may I hope to see her? Not in less than six weeks, the doctor  tells me.\"    \"A weary while it must seem in prospect. But we will do all we can to make  it short in passing and prevent you from regretting the necessity of  tarrying with us for so much longer time than you had intended,\" Mr.  Dinsmore answered in a cheery tone.    \"Your great kindness is laying me under lasting obligations, Mr.  Dinsmore,\" the captain responded, with glistening eyes, \"obligations which  I shall never, I fear, have an opportunity to repay.\"    \"My dear sir, I am truly thankful to have it in my power to do what can be  done to alleviate your sufferings and restore the health and vigor you so  nobly sacrificed for another. Beside, what Christian can recall the  Master's assurance that He will consider any kindness done to any follower  of His as done to Himself, and not rejoice in the opportunity to be of  service to a fellow-disciple, be it man, woman, or child?\"    \"Yes, And the King shall answer and say unto them, 'Verily I say unto you,  inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye  have done it unto me.'\"    \"Ah, captain, don't talk of obligation to one who has a recompense such as  that in view!\" Mr. Dinsmore said, a smile on his lip, a glad light in his  eye.    The captain stretched out his hand and grasped that of his host. \"What  cause for gratitude that I have fallen into the care of those who can  appreciate and act from such motives!\" he exclaimed with emotion.    \"You are the hero of the hour, my friend,\" Mr. Dinsmore remarked after a  short silence. \"I wish you could have seen the faces of my wife, daughter,  and granddaughter when they heard of the noble, unselfish, and courageous  deed which was the cause of your sore injuries.\"    \"Don't mention it!\" exclaimed the captain, a manly flush suffusing his  face; \"who could stand by and see a fellow-creature perish without so much  as stretching out a helping hand?\"    In the weeks that followed Captain Raymond won golden opinions from those  with whom he sojourned, showing himself as capable of the courage of  endurance as of that more ordinary kind that incites to deeds of daring;  he was always patient and cheerful, and sufficiently at leisure from  himself and his own troubles to show a keen interest in those about him.    After the first week he was able to take possession of an invalid-chair,  which was then wheeled into the room where the family were wont to gather  for the free and unconstrained enjoyment of each other's society.    They made him one of themselves, and he found it a rare treat to be among  them thus day after day, getting such an insight into their domestic life  and true characters as years of ordinary intercourse would not have given  him. He learned to love them all--the kind, cheerful, unselfish older  people; the sweet-faced, gentle, tender mother; the fair and lovely  maiden, lovely in mind and person; the brave, frank, open-hearted lads,  and the dear, innocent little ones.    He studied them all furtively and with increasing interest, growing more  and more reconciled the while to his involuntary detention among them.    Oftentimes they were all there, but occasionally one of the grandparents  "]]]
