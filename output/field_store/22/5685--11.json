Datu Tongkaling has had four wives, three of whom are still  living.    If a couple cannot agree, a separation can be arranged by applying to  the local head-man, who, after listening to their troubles, decides  which one is at fault, and whether or no the marriage gifts must be  returned. When a couple parts, plates, bowls, and jars are sometimes  broken as a sign that they will never live together again and the  spirits are thus called to witness. A divorced woman may remarry, but  unless the sum originally paid for her has been returned, the new groom  must pay such an amount to the first husband.    SICKNESS AND DEATH.    In case of illness a _mabalian_ administers some simple remedy without  any call on the spirits. If, however, the sickness does not yield  readily to this treatment, it is evident that the trouble is caused by  some spirit who can only be appeased by a gift, Betel nuts, leaves,  food, clothing, and some article in daily use by the patient are placed  in a dish of palm bark and on top of all is laid a roughly carved figure  of a man. This offering is passed over the body of the patient while the  _mabalian_ addresses the spirits as follows. \"Now, you can have the man  on this dish, for we have changed him for the sick man. Pardon anything  this man may have done, and let him be well again.\" Immediately after  this the dish is carried away and hidden so that the sick person may  never see it again, for should he do so the illness would return.    According to Father GISBERT a doll is carved from a piece of wood and  the spirit is addressed: \"O God, Thou who has created men and trees, and  all things, do not deprive us of life, and receive in exchange this bit  of wood which has our face.\"    In obstinate cases the invalid may be removed from his own house to  another, in order that he may be under the care of the good spirits  residing there. The _mabalian_ appplies[sic] certain medicines and then  decrees a period of taboo, during which no outsiders may enter the  house. Those within at the time the medicine was given may go out if  they desire, but must return there to sleep. Should it become evident  that the patient will die he is taken back to his own place, otherwise  his family would be called upon to reimburse the owner of the house in  which the death occurs, for bringing evil or unfriendly spirits into  their dwelling.    Governor Bolton describes a somewhat different procedure among the  members of the Guianga branch of this tribe. Having learned that Datu  Angalan was ill he went to see him, but found his house deserted. The  _datu_ was finally located in a small hut about a hundred yards away  from his own dwelling, with no attendants. The governor writes, \"When I  went in the tribesmen entered. I soon found that I had broken a charm  which prevented anyone seeing him for a certain time; that he had been  placed in the hut for that reason, and to insure his not dying in the  large house. It is likely that they had a human sacrifice at that  time.\"[40]    [40] Extract from letters of Gov. Bolton, in files of the Governor at  Davao.    Following a death the body is covered with good clothing and is placed  in the middle of the house. Wailers sit by the corpse, fanning it to  keep away flies, or making an occasional offering of food; while the  friends gather to talk of the virtues of the deceased, to console the  family, and to partake of the food and drink which has been provided for  the gathering. The body is kept over one night, and in the case of great  personages, for three days, or until the coffin--a large log split in  halves and hollowed out--is prepared. When this is ready the body is  placed in it, together with some prized articles of the deceased. After  the top has been fitted to the lower portion, they are lashed together  and the cracks are filled with lime.[41] The body is buried beneath the  house, and the grave is protected by a bamboo fence, within which is  placed food, small offerings, or perhaps a shield and spear. In some  instances the coffin is allowed to remain in the house, which is then  abandoned. It is said that when Datu Taopan died his funeral lasted ten  days, and on the last day the house was decked, inside and out, with  flowers and valuable gifts, and was then deserted.    [41] When the deceased has been a person of note the coffin is sometimes  decorated or colored. The coffin of a _magani_ should be red, yellow,  and black; while that of a _mabalian_ should be yellow, black, and  brown.    Following the burial the family lives in the house where the death  occurred until a human sacrifice has been made. During this period they  live very quietly, eat poor food, wear old clothing, and abstain from  all amusements. If their wealth permits, they may shorten the period of  mourning by making a special sacrifice, but in most cases the bereaved  will wait until the yearly sacrifice when they will purchase a share in  the victim and thus remove the taboo. Following the offering, the old  house is abandoned and is allowed to fall to pieces for \"the man has  gone and his house must go also.\" The procedure is the same for women,  and for children who have survived infancy.    BELIEFS CONCERNING THE SOUL, SPIRITS, ORACLES, AND MAGIC.    There is some variance, in different parts of the Bagobo area, in the  beliefs concerning the spirits or souls of a man. In Cibolan each man  and woman is supposed to have eight spirits or _gimokod_, which dwell in  the head, the right and left hands and feet, and other parts not  specified. At death these _gimokod_ part, four from the right side of  the body, going up to a place called _palakalangit_, and four descending  to a region known as _karonaronawan_.These places differ in no respects  from the present home of the Bagobo, except that in the region above it  is always day, and all useful plants grow in abundance. In these places  the _gimokod_ are met by the spirits, Toglai and Tigyama, and by them  are assigned to their future homes. If a man has been a _datu_ on earth,  his spirits have like rank in the other life, but go to the same place  as those of common people. The _gimokod_ of evil men are punished by  being crowded into poor houses. These spirits may return to their old  home for short periods, and talk with the _gimokod_ of the living  through dreams, but they never return to dwell again on earth.    In the districts to the west of Cibolan the general belief is that there  are but two _gimokod_, one inhabiting the right side of the body, the  other the left. That of the right side is good, while all evil deeds and  inclinations come from the one dwelling on the left. It is a common  thing when a child is ill to attach a chain bracelet to its right arm  and to bid the good spirit not to depart, but to remain and restore the  child to health. In Malilla it is believed that after death the spirit  of the right side goes to a good place, while the one on the left  remains to wander about on earth as a _buso_,[42] but this latter belief  does not seem to be shared by the people of other districts.    [42] See p. 107.    Aside from the _gimokod_ the Bagobo believe that there exists a great  company of powerful spirits who make their homes in the sky above, in  the space beneath the world, or in the sea, in streams, cliffs,  mountains, or trees. The following is the list related by Datu  Tongkaling, a number of _mabalian_, and others supposed to have special  knowledge concerning these superior beings.    I. Eugpamolak Manobo, also called Manama and Kalayagan. The first and  greatest of the spirits, and the creator of all that is. His home is in  the sky from whence he can observe the doings of men. Gifts for him  should be white, and should be placed above and in the center of  offerings intended for other spirits. He may be addressed by the  _mabalian_, the _datu_, and wise old men.    II. Tolus ka balakat, \"dweller in the _balakat_[43].\" A male spirit who  loves the blood, but not the flesh of human beings, and one of the three  for whom the yearly sacrifice is made. Only the _magani_ may offer  petitions to him. He is not recognized by the people of Digos and  vicinity.    [43] A hanger in which offerings are placed.    III and IV. Mandarangan and his wife Darago. This couple look after the  fortunes of the warriors, and in return demand the yearly sacrifice of a  slave. They are supposed to dwell in the great fissure of Mt. Apo, from  which clouds of sulphur fumes are constantly rising. The intentions of  this pair are evil, and only the utmost care on the part of the _magani_  can prevent them from causing quarrels and dissentions[sic] among the  people, or even actually devouring some of them.    V. Taragomi. A male spirit who owns all food. He is the guardian of the  crops and it is for him that the shrine known as _parobanian_ is erected  in the center of the rice field.    VI. Tolus ka towangan. The patron of the workers in brass and copper.    VII. Tolus ka gomanan. Patron of the smiths.    VIII. Baitpandi. A female spirit who taught the women to weave, and who  now presides over the looms and the weavers.    IX. and X. Toglai, also called Si Niladan and Maniladan, and his wife  Toglibon. The first man and woman to live on the earth. They gave to the  people their language and customs. After their death they became  spirits, and are now responsible for all marriages and births. By some  people Toglai is believed to be one of the judges over the shades of the  dead, while in Bansalan he is identified with Eugpamolak Manobo.    XI. Tigyama. A class of spirits, one of whom looks after each family.  When children marry, the _tigyama_ of the two families unite to form one  who thereafter guards the couple. While usually well disposed they are  capable of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18274"],[0,"A Book of Natural History (#13)"],[1,"more interesting than to pry into these solutions and note  how varied, strange, and wonderful they are.    To fully appreciate some of the facts mentioned below it must be borne  in mind that there is no such thing as \"spontaneous generation\" of  life. Every cell is the offspring of a pre-existing cell. Nothing but  a living thing can produce a living thing. Hence every weed that next  season will spring up and provoke the farmer's ire, and every insect  which will then make life almost intolerable for man or beast, exists  throughout the winter in some form....    Beginning with the earth-worms and their kindred, we find that at the  approach of winter they burrow deep down where the icy breath of the  frost never reaches, and there they live, during the cold season, a  life of comparative quiet. That they are exceedingly sensitive to  warmth, however, may be proven by the fact that when a warm rain comes  some night in February or March, thawing out the crust of the earth,  the next morning reveals in our dooryards the mouths of hundreds of  the pits or burrows of these primitive tillers of the soil, each  surrounded by a little pile of pellets, the castings of the active  artisans of the pits during the night before.    If we will get up before dawn on such a morning we can find the worms  crawling actively about over the surface of the ground, but when the  first signs of day appear they seek once more their protective  burrows, and only an occasional belated individual serves as a  breakfast for the early birds.    The eyes of these lowly creatures are not visible, and consist of  single special cells scattered among the epidermal cells of the skin,  and connected by means of a sensory nerve fibre with a little bunch of  nervous matter in the body. Such a simple visual apparatus serves them  only in distinguishing light from darkness, but this to them is most  important knowledge, as it enables them to avoid the surface of the  earth by day, when their worst enemies, the birds, are in active  search for them.    The fresh-water mussels and snails and the crayfish burrow deep into  the mud and silt at the bottom of ponds and streams where they lie  motionless during the winter. The land snails, in late autumn, crawl  beneath logs, and, burrowing deep into the soft mould, they withdraw  far into their shells. Then each one forms with a mucous secretion two  thin transparent membranes, one across the opening of the shell and  one a little farther within, thus making the interior of the shell  perfectly air-tight. There for five or six months he sleeps, free from  the pangs of hunger and the blasts of winter, and when the balmy  breezes of spring blow up from the south he breaks down and devours  the protecting membrane and goes forth with his home on his back to  seek fresh leaves for food and to find for himself a mate.    Next in the scale come the insects, which comprise four-fifths of all  existing animals, and each one of the mighty horde seen in summer has  passed the winter in some form. One must look for them in strange  places and under many disguises; for they cannot migrate, as do the  majority of the birds, nor can they live an active life while the  source of their food supply, the plants, are inactive.    The majority of those insects which in May or June will be found  feeding on the buds or leaves of our trees, or crawling worm-like over  the grass of our lawns, or burrowing beneath the roots of our garden  plants, are represented in the winter by the eggs alone. These eggs  are deposited in autumn by the mother insect, on or near the object  destined to furnish the young, or larvae, their food. Each egg  corresponds to a seed of one of our annual plants; being, like it,  but a form of life so fashioned and fitted as to withstand for a long  period intense cold; the mother insect, like the summer form of the  plant, succumbing to the first severe frost.    Thus myriads of the eggs of grasshoppers are in the early autumn  deposited in the ground, in compact masses of forty to sixty each.  About mid-April they begin to hatch, and the sprightly little insects,  devoid of wings, but otherwise like their parents, begin their  life-work of changing grass into flesh.    [Illustration: HEDGEHOG CATERPILLAR.]    A comparatively small number of insects pass the winter in the larval  or active stage of the young. Of these, perhaps the best known is the  brown \"woolly worm\" or \"hedgehog caterpillar,\" as it is familiarly  called. It is thickly covered with stiff black hairs on each end, and  with reddish hairs on the middle of the body. These hairs appear to be  evenly and closely shorn, so as to give the animal a velvety look; and  as they have a certain degree of elasticity, and the caterpillar curls  up at the slightest touch, it generally manages to slip away when  taken into the hand. Beneath loose bark, boards, rails, and stones,  this caterpillar may be found in mid-winter, coiled up and apparently  lifeless. On the first bright, sunny days of spring it may be seen  crawling rapidly over the ground, seeking the earnest vegetation which  will furnish it a literal \"breakfast.\" In April or May the chrysalis,  surrounded by a loose cocoon formed of the hairs of the body  interwoven with coarse silk, may be found in situations similar to  those in which the larva passed the winter. From this, the perfect  insect, the Isabella tiger moth, _Pyrrharctia isabella_ Smith, emerges  about the last of June. It is a medium sized moth, dull orange in  color, with three rows of small black spots on the body, and some  scattered spots of the same color on the wings.    By breaking open rotten logs one can find in mid-winter the grubs or  larvae of many of the wood-boring beetles, and, beneath logs and stones  near the margins of ponds and brooks, hordes of the maggots or larvae  of certain kinds of flies may often be found huddled together in great  masses. The larvae of a few butterflies also live over winter beneath  chips or bunches of leaves near the roots of their food plant, or in  webs of their own construction, which are woven on the stems close to  the buds, whose expanding leaves will furnish them their first meal in  spring.    Many insects pass the winter in the quiescent or pupal stage; a state  exceedingly well fitted for hibernating, requiring as it does, no  food, and giving plenty of time for the marvellous changes which are  then undergone. Some of these pupae are enclosed in dense silken  cocoons, which are bound to the twigs of the plants upon which the  larvae feed, and thus they swing securely in their silken hammocks  through all the storms of winter. Perhaps the most common of these is  that of the brown Cecropian moth, _Attacus cecropia_ L., the large  oval cocoon of which is a conspicuous object in the winter on the  twigs of our common shade and fruit trees. Many other pupae may be  found beneath logs or on the under side of bark, and usually have the  chrysalis surrounded by a thin covering of hairs, which are rather  loosely arranged. A number pass the cold season in the earth with no  protective covering whatever. Among these is a large brown chrysalis  with a long tongue case bent over so as to resemble the handle of a  jug. Every farm boy has ploughed or spaded it up in the spring, and is  it but the pupa of a large sphinx moth, _Protoparce celeus_ Hub., the  larva of which is the great green worm, with a \"horn on its tail,\" so  common on tomato plants in the late summer.    [Illustration: CHRYSALIS OF TOMATO WORM.]    Each of the winter forms of insects above mentioned can withstand long  and severe cold weather--in fact, may be frozen solid for weeks and  retain life and vigor, both of which are shown when warm weather and  food appear again. Indeed, it is not an unusually cold winter, but one  of successive thawings and freezings, which is most destructive to  insect life. A mild winter encourages the growth of mould which  attacks the hibernating larvae and pupae as soon as, from excess of rain  or humidity, they become sickly; and it also permits the continued  activity of insectivorous mammals and birds. Thus, moles, shrews,  and field mice, instead of burying themselves deeply in the ground,  run about freely during an open winter and destroy enormous numbers  of pupae; while such birds as the woodpeckers, titmice, and chickadees  are constantly on the alert, and searching in every crevice and cranny  of fence and bark of tree for the hibernating larvae.    Of the creeping, wingless creatures, which can ever be found beneath  rocks, rails, chunks, and especially beneath those old decaying logs  which are half buried in the rich vegetable mould, the myriapods, or  \"thousand-legs,\" deserve more than a passing notice. They are typical  examples of that great branch of the animal kingdom known as  _arthropods_, which comprises all insects and crustaceans. Each  arthropod has the body composed of rings placed end to end and bearing  jointed appendages, and in the myriapods each ring and its appendages  can be plainly seen; whereas in the higher forms of the branch many of  the rings are so combined as to be very difficult to distinguish.    Full forty kinds of myriapods occur in any area comprising one hundred  square miles in the eastern United States. About twenty-five of them  go by the general name of \"thousand-legs\" or millipedes, as each has  from forty to fifty-five cylindrical rings in the body, and two pairs  of legs to each ring. The other fifteen belong to the \"centipede\"  group, the body consisting of about sixteen flattened segments, or  rings, each bearing a single pair of legs. When disturbed, the  \"thousand-legs\" generally coils up and remains motionless, shamming  death, or \"playing possum,\" as it is popularly put, as a means of  defence; while the centipede scampers hurriedly away and endeavors to  hide beneath leaf, chip, or other object.
