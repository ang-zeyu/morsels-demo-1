Look! just now, it is ten o'clock in the morning.\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"Another application of electricity.  This dial hanging in front of us  indicates the speed of the Nautilus.  An electric thread puts it in  communication with the screw, and the needle indicates the real speed.  Look! now we are spinning along with a uniform speed of fifteen miles  an hour.\"    \"It is marvelous!  And I see, Captain, you were right to make use of  this agent that takes the place of wind, water, and steam.\"    \"We have not finished, M. Aronnax,\" said Captain Nemo, rising.  \"If you  will allow me, we will examine the stern of the Nautilus.\"    Really, I knew already the anterior part of this submarine boat, of  which this is the exact division, starting from the ship's head: the  dining-room, five yards long, separated from the library by a  water-tight partition; the library, five yards long; the large  drawing-room, ten yards long, separated from the Captain's room by a  second water-tight partition; the said room, five yards in length;  mine, two and a half yards; and, lastly a reservoir of air, seven and a  half yards, that extended to the bows.  Total length thirty five yards,  or one hundred and five feet.  The partitions had doors that were shut  hermetically by means of india-rubber instruments, and they ensured the  safety of the Nautilus in case of a leak.    I followed Captain Nemo through the waist, and arrived at the centre of  the boat.  There was a sort of well that opened between two partitions.  An iron ladder, fastened with an iron hook to the partition, led to the  upper end.  I asked the Captain what the ladder was used for.    \"It leads to the small boat,\" he said.    \"What! have you a boat?\"  I exclaimed, in surprise.    \"Of course; an excellent vessel, light and insubmersible, that serves  either as a fishing or as a pleasure boat.\"    \"But then, when you wish to embark, you are obliged to come to the  surface of the water?\"    \"Not at all.  This boat is attached to the upper part of the hull of  the Nautilus, and occupies a cavity made for it.  It is decked, quite  water-tight, and held together by solid bolts.  This ladder leads to a  man-hole made in the hull of the Nautilus, that corresponds with a  similar hole made in the side of the boat.  By this double opening I  get into the small vessel.  They shut the one belonging to the  Nautilus; I shut the other by means of screw pressure.  I undo the  bolts, and the little boat goes up to the surface of the sea with  prodigious rapidity.  I then open the panel of the bridge, carefully  shut till then; I mast it, hoist my sail, take my oars, and I'm off.\"    \"But how do you get back on board?\"    \"I do not come back, M. Aronnax; the Nautilus comes to me.\"    \"By your orders?\"    \"By my orders.  An electric thread connects us.  I telegraph to it, and  that is enough.\"    \"Really,\" I said, astonished at these marvels, \"nothing can be more  simple.\"    After having passed by the cage of the staircase that led to the  platform, I saw a cabin six feet long, in which Conseil and Ned Land,  enchanted with their repast, were devouring it with avidity.  Then a  door opened into a kitchen nine feet long, situated between the large  store-rooms. There electricity, better than gas itself, did all the  cooking.  The streams under the furnaces gave out to the sponges of  platina a heat which was regularly kept up and distributed.  They also  heated a distilling apparatus, which, by evaporation, furnished  excellent drinkable water.  Near this kitchen was a bathroom  comfortably furnished, with hot and cold water taps.    Next to the kitchen was the berth-room of the vessel, sixteen feet  long.  But the door was shut, and I could not see the management of it,  which might have given me an idea of the number of men employed on  board the Nautilus.    At the bottom was a fourth partition that separated this office from  the engine-room. A door opened, and I found myself in the compartment  where Captain Nemo--certainly an engineer of a very high order--had  arranged his locomotive machinery.  This engine-room, clearly lighted,  did not measure less than sixty-five feet in length.  It was divided  into two parts; the first contained the materials for producing  electricity, and the second the machinery that connected it with the  screw.  I examined it with great interest, in order to understand the  machinery of the Nautilus.    \"You see,\" said the Captain, \"I use Bunsen's contrivances, not  Ruhmkorff's. Those would not have been powerful enough.  Bunsen's are  fewer in number, but strong and large, which experience proves to be  the best.  The electricity produced passes forward, where it works, by  electro-magnets of great size, on a system of levers and cog-wheels  that transmit the movement to the axle of the screw.  This one, the  diameter of which is nineteen feet, and the thread twenty-three feet,  performs about 120 revolutions in a second.\"    \"And you get then?\"    \"A speed of fifty miles an hour.\"    \"I have seen the Nautilus manoeuvre before the Abraham Lincoln, and I  have my own ideas as to its speed.  But this is not enough.  We must  see where we go.  We must be able to direct it to the right, to the  left, above, below.  How do you get to the great depths, where you find  an increasing resistance, which is rated by hundreds of atmospheres?  How do you return to the surface of the ocean?  And how do you maintain  yourselves in the requisite medium?  Am I asking too much?\"    \"Not at all, Professor,\" replied the Captain, with some hesitation;  \"since you may never leave this submarine boat.  Come into the saloon,  it is our usual study, and there you will learn all you want to know  about the Nautilus.\"        CHAPTER XII    SOME FIGURES    A moment after we were seated on a divan in the saloon smoking.  The  Captain showed me a sketch that gave the plan, section, and elevation  of the Nautilus.  Then he began his description in these words:    \"Here, M. Aronnax, are the several dimensions of the boat you are in.  It is an elongated cylinder with conical ends.  It is very like a cigar  in shape, a shape already adopted in London in several constructions of  the same sort.  The length of this cylinder, from stem to stern, is  exactly 232 feet, and its maximum breadth is twenty-six feet.  It is  not built quite like your long-voyage steamers, but its lines are  sufficiently long, and its curves prolonged enough, to allow the water  to slide off easily, and oppose no obstacle to its passage.  These two  dimensions enable you to obtain by a simple calculation the surface and  cubic contents of the Nautilus.  Its area measures 6,032 feet; and its  contents about 1,500 cubic yards; that is to say, when completely  immersed it displaces 50,000 feet of water, or weighs 1,500 tons.    \"When I made the plans for this submarine vessel, I meant that  nine-tenths should be submerged:  consequently it ought only to  displace nine-tenths of its bulk, that is to say, only to weigh that  number of tons.  I ought not, therefore, to have exceeded that weight,  constructing it on the aforesaid dimensions.    \"The Nautilus is composed of two hulls, one inside, the other outside,  joined by T-shaped irons, which render it very strong.  Indeed, owing  to this cellular arrangement it resists like a block, as if it were  solid.  Its sides cannot yield; it coheres spontaneously, and not by  the closeness of its rivets; and its perfect union of the materials  enables it to defy the roughest seas.    \"These two hulls are composed of steel plates, whose density is from .7  to .8 that of water.  The first is not less than two inches and a half  thick and weighs 394 tons.  The second envelope, the keel, twenty  inches high and ten thick, weighs only sixty-two tons.  The engine, the  ballast, the several accessories and apparatus appendages, the  partitions and bulkheads, weigh 961.62 tons.  Do you follow all this?\"    \"I do.\"    \"Then, when the Nautilus is afloat under these circumstances, one-tenth  is out of the water.  Now, if I have made reservoirs of a size equal to  this tenth, or capable of holding 150 tons, and if I fill them with  water, the boat, weighing then 1,507 tons, will be completely immersed.  That would happen, Professor.  These reservoirs are in the lower part  of the Nautilus.  I turn on taps and they fill, and the vessel sinks  that had just been level with the surface.\"    \"Well, Captain, but now we come to the real difficulty.  I can  understand your rising to the surface; but, diving below the surface,  does not your submarine contrivance encounter a pressure, and  consequently undergo an upward thrust of one atmosphere for every  thirty feet of water, just about fifteen pounds per square inch?\"    \"Just so, sir.\"    \"Then, unless you quite fill the Nautilus, I do not see how you can  draw it down to those depths.\"    \"Professor, you must not confound statics with dynamics or you will be  exposed to grave errors.  There is very little labour spent in  attaining the lower regions of the ocean, for all bodies have a  tendency to sink.  When I wanted to find out the necessary increase of  weight required to sink the Nautilus, I had only to calculate the  reduction of volume that sea-water acquires according to the depth.\"    \"That is evident.\"    \"Now, if water is not absolutely incompressible, it is at least capable  of very slight compression.  Indeed, after the most recent calculations  this reduction is only .000436 of an atmosphere for each thirty feet of  depth.  If we want to sink 3,000 feet, I should keep account of the  reduction of bulk under a pressure equal to that of a column of water  of a thousand feet.  The calculation is easily verified.  Now, I have  supplementary reservoirs capable of holding a hundred tons.

The latter, after pairing, burrow underground and lay their  eggs in the roots, the larvae causing the presence there of globular  swellings or root-galls within which they live, pass through their  transformations and develop into wingless virgin females. These shelter  until February or March in their underground chambers, then climb up  the tree and lay on the shoots eggs, from which will be hatched the  grubs destined to grow within the oak-apples into the summer sexual  brood of flies.    The Lepidoptera afford examples of hibernation in all stages of the  life-history. In this order a few large moths with wood-boring  caterpillars, the 'Goat' (Cossus) for example, undergo a development  extending over several years, while at the other extreme a few small  species may have three or more complete cycles within the twelve months.  But in the vast majority of Lepidoptera we find either one or two  generations, definitely seasonal, within the year; the insect is either  'single-brooded' or 'double-brooded.'    Almost every winter one or more letters may be read in some newspaper  recording the writer's surprise at seeing on a sunny day during the cold  season, one of our common gaily-coloured butterflies of the Vanessa  group, a 'Tortoiseshell' or 'Red Admiral,' flitting about. Surprise  might be greater did the observers realise that the imaginal is the  normal hibernating stage for these species. Emerging from the pupa in  late summer or autumn, they shelter during winter in hollow trees, under  thatched eaves, in outbuildings or in similar situations, coming out in  spring to lay their eggs on the leaves of their caterpillars'  food-plants. The larvae feed and grow through the early summer months,  in the case of the Small Tortoiseshell (_Vanessa urticae_) pupating  before midsummer and developing into a July brood of butterflies whose  offspring after a late summer life-cycle, hibernate; while for the  larger species of the group there is, in our islands, only one complete  life-cycle in the year, though the same insects in warmer countries may  be double-brooded. C.G. Barrett records (1893, vol. I. pp. 153-4) how in  the August of 1879 hundreds and thousands of 'Painted Ladies' (_Pyrameis  cardui_) migrated into the south of England from the European continent  where in many places great swarms had been observed early in the summer.  'These August butterflies, the progeny of the June swarms, coming from a  warmer climate, had no intention of hibernating, but paired and laid  eggs. Some of the larvae were collected and reared indoors [butterflies]  emerging in November and December, but out of doors all must have been  destroyed by damp or frost, in either the larva or pupa state, for no  freshly emerged specimens were noticed in the spring, and no trace of  the great migration remained.'    In September and October the pedestrian, even in a suburban square, may  see moths with pretty brown, white-spotted wings flying around trees.  These are males of the common 'Vapourer' (_Orgyia antiqua_), in search  of the females which, wingless and helpless, rest on the cocoons  surrounding the pupae whence they have just emerged, the cocoons being  attached to the branches of the trees where the caterpillars have fed.  After pairing, the female lays her eggs among the silk of the cocoon,  partly covering them with hairs shed from her body, and then dies. The  eggs thus protected remain through the winter, the larvae not being  hatched till springtide, when the young leaves begin to sprout forth.  The caterpillars, adorned and probably protected by their 'tussocks' of  black or coloured bristles, feed vigorously. Their activity and habit of  occasional migration from one tree to another, compensates, to some  extent, as Miall (1908) has pointed out, for the females' enforced  passivity; only in the larval state can moths with such wingless females  extend their range. The caterpillars spin their cocoons towards the end  of summer, and then pupate, the moths emerging in the autumn and the  eggs, as we have seen, furnishing the winter stage.    After midsummer, the conspicuous cream, black and yellow-spotted  'Magpie' moth (_Abraxas grossulariata_) is common in gardens. The female  lays her eggs on a variety of shrubby plants; gooseberry and currant  bushes are often chosen. From the eggs caterpillars are hatched in  autumn, but these, instead of beginning to feed, seek almost at once for  rolled-up leaves, cracks in walls, crannies of bark, or similar places,  which may afford winter shelters. Here they remain until the spring,  when they come out to feed on the young foliage and grow rapidly into  the conspicuous cream, yellow and black 'looper' caterpillars mentioned  in a previous chapter (p. 60). These, when fully-grown, spin among the  twigs of the food-plant a light cocoon, in which the black and  yellow-banded wasp-like pupa spends its short summer term before the  emergence of the moth.    An equally familiar garden insect, the common 'Tiger' moth (_Arctia  caia_) with its 'woolly bear' caterpillar, affords a life-cycle slightly  differing from that of the 'Magpie.' The gaudy winged insects are seen  in July and August, and lay their eggs on a great variety of plants. The  larvae hatched from these eggs begin to feed at once, and having moulted  once or twice and attained about half their full size, they rest through  the winter, the dense hairy covering wherewith they are provided forming  an effective protection against the cold. At the approach of spring they  begin to feed again, and the fully-grown 'woolly bear' is a common  object on garden paths in May and June. Before midsummer it has usually  spun its yellow cocoon under some shelter on the ground and changed into  a pupa.    Another modification with respect to seasonal change is shown by the  Turnip moth (_Agrotis segetum_) and other allied Noctuidae (Owl-moths).  These are insects with brown-coloured wings, flying after dark in June.  The dull greyish larvae feed on many kinds of low-growing plants,  usually hiding in the earth by day and wandering along the surface of  the ground by night, biting off the farmer's ripening corn, or burrowing  into his turnips or potatoes. On account of the burrowing habits of this  insect it can feed throughout the winter, except when a hard frost puts  a temporary stop to its activity. By April it has become fully grown and  pupates in an earthen chamber a few inches below the surface. The Turnip  moth in our countries is partially double-brooded, a minority of the  autumn caterpillars growing more rapidly than their comrades so that  they pupate, and a second brood of moths appear in September. These pair  and lay eggs, the resulting caterpillars going as Barrett suggests  (1896, vol. III. p. 291) 'to reinforce the great army of wintering  larvae.'    Such underground caterpillars, to a great extent protected from cold,  can continue to feed through the winter. With other species we find that  the larva becomes fully grown in autumn, yet lives through the winter  without further change. This is the case with the Codling moth  (_Carpocapsa pomonella_), a well-known orchard pest, which in our  countries is usually single-brooded. The moth is flying in May and lays  her eggs on the shoots or leaves of apple-trees, more rarely on the  fruitlets, into which however the caterpillar always bores by the upper  (calyx) end. Here it feeds, growing with the growth of the fruit,  feeding on the tissue around the cores, ultimately eating its way out  through a lateral hole, and crawling upwards if its apple-habitation has  fallen, downwards if it still remains on the bough, to shelter under a  loose piece of bark where it spins its cocoon about midsummer and  hibernates still in the larval condition. Not until spring is the pupal  form assumed, and then it quickly passes into the imaginal state. In the  south of England, as F.V. Theobald (1909) has lately shown, and also in  southwestern Ireland, this species may be double-brooded, the usual  condition on the European continent and in the United States of America.  There the midsummer larvae pupate at once and the moths of an August  brood lay eggs on the hanging or stored fruit; in this case, again,  however, the full-grown larva, quickly fed-up within the developed  apples, is the wintering stage.    Several of the insects mentioned in this survey, like the last-named  codling moth, are occasionally double-brooded. As an example of the many  Lepidoptera, which in our islands have normally two complete life-cycles  in the year, we may take the very familiar White butterflies (Pieris) of  which three species are common everywhere. The appearance of the first  brood of these butterflies on the wing in late April or May is hailed as  a sign of advanced spring-time. They pair and lay their eggs on  cabbages and other plants, and the green hairy caterpillars feed in June  and July, after which the spotted pupae may be found on fences and  walls, attached by the silken tail-pad and supported by the  waist-girdle. In August and September butterflies of the second brood  have emerged from these and are on the wing; their offspring are the  autumn caterpillars which feed in some seasons as late as November,  doing often serious damage to the late cruciferous crops before they  pupate. The pupae may be seen during the winter months, waiting for the  spring sunshine to call out the butterflies whose structures are being  formed beneath the hard cuticle.    Reviewing the small selection of life-stories of various Lepidoptera  just sketched, we notice an interesting and suggestive variety in the  wintering stage. The vanessid butterflies hibernate as imagos; the  'vapourer' winters in the egg, the magpie as a young ungrown larva, the  'tiger' as a half-size larva; the Agrotis caterpillar feeds through the  winter,"]]]
