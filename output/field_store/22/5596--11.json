[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16363"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol 1, Issue 4, January (#13)"],[1,"twenty years ago there was a paragraph in their field service  regulations directing that the service of protection in the field, such  as outposts and advance guards, should always be supplemented by a  system of espionage. Although such instructions are no longer made  public the Germans, as is well known, still carry them into effect.    Apart from the more elaborate arrangements which were made in peace time  for obtaining information by paid agents some of the methods which are  being employed for the collection or conveyance of intelligence are as  follows:    Men in plain clothes signal the German lines from points in the hands of  the enemy by means of colored lights at nights and puffs of smoke from  chimneys in the day time. Pseudo laborers working in the fields between  the armies have been detected conveying information. Persons in plain  clothes have acted as advanced scouts to the German cavalry when  advancing.    German officers or soldiers in plain clothes or French or British  uniforms have remained in localities evacuated by the Germans in order  to furnish them with intelligence. One spy of this kind was found by our  troops hidden in a church tower. His presence was only discovered  through the erratic movements of the hands of the church clock, which he  was using to signal his friends by an improvised semaphore code. Had  this man not been seized it is probable he would have signalled the time  of arrival and the exact position of the headquarters staff of the force  and a high explosive shell would then have mysteriously dropped on the  building.    Women spies have also been caught. Secret agents have been found at rail  heads observing entrainments and detrainments. It is a simple matter for  spies to mix with refugees who are moving about to and from their homes,  and it is difficult for our troops, who speak neither French nor German,  to detect them. The French have also found it necessary to search  villages and casual wayfarers on the roads and to search for carrier  pigeons.    Among the precautions taken by us against spying is the following notice  printed in French, posted up:         \"Motor cars and bicycles other than those; carrying soldiers in       uniform may not circulate on the roads. Inhabitants may not leave       the localities in which they reside between 6 P.M. and 6 A.M.       Inhabitants may not quit their homes after 8 P.M. No person may on       any pretext pass through the British lines without an authorization       countersigned by a British officer.\"    Events have moved so quietly for the last two months that anything  connected with the mobilization of the British expeditionary force is  now ancient history. Nevertheless, the following extract from a German  order is evidence of the mystification of the army and a tribute to the  value of the secrecy which was so well and so loyally maintained in  England at the time:         \"Tenth Reserve Army Corps Headquarters,         \"Mont St. Guibert, Aug. 20, 1914.         \"Corps Order, Aug. 20.         \"The French troops in front of the Tenth Army Corps have retreated       south across the Sambre. Part of the Belgium army has been       withdrawn from Antwerp. It is reported that an English army has       disembarked at Calais and Boulogne, en route to Brussels.\"          IV.    *Fighting in the Air.*    [Made Public Sept. 29.]      Wednesday, Sept. 23, was a perfect Autumn day. It passed without  incident as regards major operations. Although the enemy concentrated  their heavy artillery upon the, plateau near Passy, nothing more than  inconvenience was caused.    The welcome absence of wind gave our airmen a chance of which they took  full advantage by gathering much information. Unfortunately, one of our  aviators, who had been particularly active in annoying the enemy by  dropping bombs, was wounded in a duel in the air.    Being alone on a single-seated monoplane, he was not able to use his  rifle, and while circling above a German two-seated machine in an  endeavor to get within pistol shot he was hit by the observer of the  German machine, who was armed with a rifle. He managed to fly back over  our lines, and by great good luck he descended close to a motor  ambulance, which at once conveyed him to a hospital.    Against this may be set off the fact that another of our flyers exploded  a bomb among some led artillery horses, killing several and stampeding  the others.    On Thursday, Sept. 21, the fine weather continued, as did the lull in  the action, the heavy German shells falling mostly near Pargnan, twelve  miles south-southeast of Laon.    On both Wednesday and Thursday the weather was so fine that many flights  were made by the aviators, French, British, and German. These produced a  corresponding activity among the anti-aircraft guns.    So still and clear was the atmosphere toward evening on Wednesday and  during the whole of Thursday that to those not especially on the lookout  the presence of aeroplanes high up above them was first made known by  the bursting of the projectiles aimed at them. The puffs of smoke from  the detonation shell hung in the air for minutes on end, like balls of  fleece cotton, before they slowly expanded and were dissipated.    From the places mentioned as being the chief targets for the enemy's  heavy howitzers, it will be seen that the Germans are not inclined to  concentrate their fire systematically upon definite areas in which  their aviators think they have located our guns, or upon villages where  it is imagined our troops may be billeted. The result will be to give  work to local builders.    The growing resemblance of this battle to siege warfare has already been  pointed out. The fact that the later actions of the Russo-Japanese war  assumed a similar character was thought by many to have been due to  exceptional causes, such as the narrowness of the theatre of operations  between the Chinese frontier on the west and the mountainous country of  Northern Korea on the east; the lack of roads, which limited the extent  of ground over which it was possible for the rival armies to manoeuvre,  and the fact that both forces were tied to one line of railroad.    Such factors are not exerting any influence on the present battle.  Nevertheless, a similar situation has been produced, owing firstly to  the immense power of resistance possessed by an army which is amply  equipped with heavy artillery and has sufficient time to fortify itself,  and, secondly, to the vast size of the forces engaged, which at the  present time stretch more than half way across France.    The extent of the country covered is so great as to render slow any  efforts to manoeuvre and march around to a flank in order to escape the  costly expedient of a frontal attack against heavily fortified  positions.    To state that the methods of attack must approximate more closely to  those of siege warfare the greater the resemblance of the defenses to  those of a fortress is a platitude, but it is one which will bear  repetition if it in any way assists to make the present situation clear.    There is no doubt that the position on the Aisne was not hastily  selected by the German Staff after the retreat had begun. From the  choice of ground, and the care with which the fields of fire had been  arranged to cover all possible avenues of approach, and from the amount  of work already carried out, it is clear that the contingency of having  to act on the defensive was not overlooked when the details of the  strategically offensive campaign were arranged.          V.    *Technique of This Warfare.*    [Made Public Oct. 9.]      Wednesday, Sept. 30, merely marked another day's progress in the gradual  development of the situation, and was distinguished by no activity  beyond slight attacks by the enemy. There was also artillery fire at  intervals. One of our airmen succeeded in dropping nine bombs, some of  which fell on the enemy's rolling stock collected on the railway near  Laon. Some of the enemy's front trenches were found empty at night; but  nothing much can be deduced from this fact, for they are frequently  evacuated in this way, no doubt to prevent the men in the back lines  firing on their comrades in front of them.    Thursday, Oct. 1, was a most perfect Autumn day, and the most peaceful  that there has been since the two forces engaged on the Aisne. There was  only desultory gunfire as targets offered. During the night the enemy  made a few new trenches. A French aviator dropped one bomb on a railway  station and three bombs on troops massed near it.    The weather on Friday, the 2d, was very misty in the early hours, and it  continued hazy until the late afternoon, becoming thicker again at  night. The Germans were driven out of a mill which they had occupied as  an advanced post, their guns and machine guns which supported it being  knocked out one by one by well-directed artillery fire from a flank.  During the night they made the usual two attacks on the customary spot  in our lines, and as on previous occasions were repulsed. Two of their  trenches were captured and filled in. Our loss was six men wounded.    Up to Sept, 21 the air mileage made by our airmen since the beginning  of the war amounted to 87,000 miles, an average of 2,000 miles per day,  the total equaling nearly four times the circuit of the world. The total  time spent in the air was 1,400 hours.    There are many points connected with the fighting methods of either side  that may be of interest. The following description was given by a  battalion commander who has been at the front since the commencement of  hostilities and has fought both in the open and behind intrenchments. It  must, however, be borne in mind that it only represents the experiences  of a particular unit. It deals with the tactics of the enemy's infantry:         The important points to watch are the heads of valleys and ravines,       woods--es"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16370"],[0,"Lameness of the Horse (#13)"],[1,"ficulty.    In fractures of the body of the scapula where an examination may be made  before much swelling has taken place, and in subjects that are not  heavily muscled, one should have no difficulty in recognizing the  crepitation.    Fractures of the neck of the scapula are recognized by crepitation, by  passively moving the leg, but it is necessary to exclude fractures of  the humerus when one depends upon the finding of crepitation by this  means. However, unless undue swelling exists, the exact location of the  crepitation is recognized without serious difficulty.    Treatment.--The treatment of compound fractures of the scapular spine  consists in the removal of the broken piece of bone by way of a  cutaneous incision so situated that good drainage of the wound will  follow.    Simple fractures of the body of the scapula are best treated by placing  the subject in a sling, if the animal is halter broken, and enforcing  absolute quiet for a period of from three to six weeks. Splints or  similar appliances are not of practical value in scapular fractures.    Compound fractures of the scapula usually result from violence, which at  the same time does serious injury to adjacent structures, and it then  becomes necessary to administer an expectant treatment, observing  general surgical principles and providing in so far as possible for the  comfort of the patient.      Scapulohumeral Arthritis.    Anatomy.--The scapulohumeral joint is an enarthrodial (ball and  socket) joint wherein the ball or humeral articulating head greatly  exceeds in size the socket or glenoid cavity of the scapula. The  capsular ligament surrounding this joint is very large and admits of  free and extensive movement of the articulation. There exist no lateral  or common ligaments jointing the scapula and humerus as in other joints,  but instead the tendinous portions of muscles perform this function. The  principal ones which are attached to the scapula and humerus that act as  ligaments are the supraspinatus (antea-spinatus), infraspinatus  (postea-spinatus) biceps-brachii (flexor brachii) and subscapularis  muscles.    Etiology and Occurrence.--Inflammation of the scapulohumeral  articulation results from injuries of various kinds, including punctures  which perforate the joint capsule, bruises from collars, metastatic  infections and involvement as a result of direct extension of infectious  conditions situated near the joint.    Classification.--Acute arthritis may be septic or aseptic, and there  seems to be a remarkable tendency for recovery in cases of septic  arthritis involving this joint in the horse.    Chronic arthritis with destruction of articular surfaces and ankylosis,  is seldom observed. It is only in cases of severe injury, where the  articular portions of the bones are damaged at the time of infliction of  the injury, and where the articulation remains exposed for weeks at a  time, together with immobility of the parts because of attending pain,  that permanent ankylosis results.    Scapulohumeral arthritis may result then from _infections_, local or  metastatic; from _injuries_, such as contusions of various kinds; from  _wounds_, which break the surface structure or perforate the joint  capsule; or from _luxations_.      Infectious Arthritis.    Infectious arthritis of the scapulohumeral joint the result of local  causes other than produced by septic wounds, seldom causes serious  inconvenience to the subject. Where such occurs, however, there is  manifested mixed lameness and complete extension of the extremity is  impossible. Local swelling is present and manifestations of pain are  evident upon palpation of the affected area.    Treatment.--During the first stage of the infection, local  applications, hot or cold, are indicated. A hot poultice of bran or  other suitable material contained within a muslin sack, may be supported  by means of cords or tapes which are passed over the withers and tied  around the opposite fore leg. Such an appliance may be held in position  more securely by attaching it to the affected member. Following the  acute stage of such an infection, any local counter-irritating  application or even a vesicant is in order.    Where abatement of the infectious process does not take place, and  suppuration of the structures in the vicinity of the joint occurs, it is  necessary to provide drainage for pus. In some cases of strangles, for  instance, large pus cavities are formed and drainage is imperative.  However, metastatic inflammation of this joint is seldom observed except  in cases of strangles. The animal should be kept perfectly quiet until  recovery has taken place.      Injuries.    Injuries to the scapulohumeral joint may be the result of kicks, runaway  accidents or bruises from the collar, and there may result, because of  such injuries, reactionary inflammation which will vary in intensity  from the mildest synovitis to the most severe arthritis, causing more or  less lameness.    Treatment.--The general plan of treatment in this form of arthritis is  the same as has been outlined under the head of infectious arthritis,  with the exception that there is seldom occasion to provide for drainage  of pus.      Wounds.    Wounds which cause a break of the skin and fascia overlying the  scapulohumeral joint are usually of little consequence, unless the blow  is of sufficient force to directly injure the articulation, and in such  cases, the treatment of the injury along general surgical principles,  such as cleansing the area, providing drainage for wound secretion, and  the administration of suitable dressing materials such as antiseptic  dusting powder, is all that is required for the wound. The symptoms  manifested by the subject in such cases are the same as have been  discussed heretofore and merit no special consideration.    Prognosis.--Unless very serious injury be done the articular portions  of the scapula or the humerus, resulting in the destruction of the  capsular ligament, prognosis is entirely favorable.    Open Joint.--Where the capsular ligament is perforated and the  condition becomes one of open joint, then a special wound treatment  becomes necessary. The surface of the skin is first freed from all hair  and filth in the vicinity of the wound. The wound proper is cleared of  all foreign material either by clipping with the scissors, curetting or  mopping with cotton or gauze pledgets. The whole exposed wound surface  as well as the interior of the joint cavity, if much exposed, is  moistened with tincture of iodin. Subsequent treatment consists in a  local application of a desiccant dusting powder, which should be applied  five or six times daily. The composition of the powder should be such as  to permit of its liberal use, thereby affording mechanical protection to  the wound as well as exerting a desiccative effect. Equal parts of boric  acid and exsiccated alum serve very well in such cases.    Animals suffering from open joints of this kind should be confined in a  standing position, preferably in slings, and kept so confined for three  or four weeks. Since they usually bear weight upon the affected member,  there is no danger of laminitis resulting.      Luxation of the Scapulohumeral Joint.    Because of the large humeral head articulating as it does with a  glenoid cavity, scapulohumeral luxations are very rare in the horse.  According to Moller[7], luxation is generally due to excessive flexion  of the scapulohumeral joint. In such cases the head of the humerus is  displaced anterior to the articular portion of the scapula and remains  so fixed.    Symptoms.--Complete luxation of the scapula is recognized because of  immobility of the scapulohumeral joint and of the abnormal position of  the head of the humerus, which can be recognized by palpation, unless  the swelling be excessive. Immobility of the scapulohumeral joint is  noticeable when one attempts to passively move the parts.    Treatment.--Reduction of the luxation is effected by making use of the  same general principles that are employed in the reduction of all  luxations, and they are--the control of the animal so that the  manipulations of the operator are not antagonized by muscular  contraction, which is best accomplished by anesthesia; placing the  luxated bones in the position which they have taken to become unjointed;  and then making use of force which is directed in a manner opposite to  that which has effected the luxation.    In a forward luxation of this kind, the operator should further flex the  humerus, and while it is in this flexed position, force is exerted upon  the articular head of this bone, and it is pushed downward and backward  into its normal position.    After-care consists in restriction of exercise and, if necessary,  confining the subject in a sling and the application of a vesicant over  the scapulohumeral region.      Inflammation of the Bicipital Bursa.  (Bursitis Intertubercularis.)    Anatomy.--There is interposed between the tendon of the biceps brachii  (flexor brachii) and the intertubercular or bicipital groove a heavy  cartilaginous pad, which is a part of the bursa of the biceps brachii.  This synovial bursa forms a smooth groove through which the biceps  brachii glides in the anterior scapulohumeral region. Great strain is  put upon these parts because the biceps brachii is the chief inhibiting  structure of the scapulohumeral articulation--the one which prevents  further flexion of the humerus during weight bearing. Passing, as it  does, over two articulations, the biceps brachii has a somewhat  complicated function, being a flexor of the radius and an extensor of  the humerus. Thus it is seen, the biceps brachii is a weight bearing  structure, as well as one that has to do with swinging the leg.    Etiology and Occurrence.--Because of the exposed position of the  bicipital bursa (bursa-intertubercularis) it is occasionally injured.  Blows and injuries"]]]
