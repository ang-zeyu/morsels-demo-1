As soon as the Romans were within this place the other end was  blocked in the same way, and thus they were all closed up at the mercy  of their enemies.    What was to be done with them? asked the Samnites; and they went to  consult old Herennius, the father of Pontius, the wisest man in the  nation. \"Open the way and let them all go free,\" he said.    \"What! without gaining any advantage?\"    \"Then kill them all.\"    He was asked to explain such extraordinary advice. He said that to  release them generously would be to make them friends and allies for  ever; but if the war was to go on, the best thing for Samnium would be  to destroy such a number of enemies at a blow. But the Samnites could  not resolve upon either plan; so they took a middle course, the worst of  all, since it only made the Romans furious without weakening them. They  were made to take off all their armor and lay down their weapons, and  thus to pass out under the yoke, namely, three spears set up like a  doorway. The consuls, after agreeing to a disgraceful peace, had to go  first, wearing only their undermost garment, then all the rest, two and  two, and if any one of them gave an angry look, he was immediately  knocked down and killed. They went on in silence into Campania, where,  when night came on, they all threw themselves, half-naked, silent, and  hungry upon the grass. The people of Capua came out to help them, and  brought them food and clothing, trying to do them all honor and comfort  them, but they would neither look up nor speak. And thus they went on  to Rome, where everybody had put on mourning, and all the ladies went  without their jewels, and the shops in the Forum were closed. The  unhappy men stole into their houses at night one by one, and the consuls  would not resume their office, but two were appointed to serve instead  for the rest of the year.    [Illustration: ANCIENT ROME.]    Revenge was all that was thought of, but the difficulty was the peace  to which the consuls had sworn. Posthumius said that if it was disavowed  by the Senate, he, who had been driven to make it, must be given back to  the Samnites. So, with his hands tied, he was taken back to the Samnite  camp by a herald and delivered over; but at that moment Posthumius gave  the herald a kick, crying out, \"I am now a Samnite, and have insulted  you, a Roman herald. This is a just cause of war.\" Pontius and the  Samnites were very angry, and they said it was an unworthy trick; but  they did not prevent Posthumius from going safely back to the Romans,  who considered him to have quite retrieved his honor.    A battle was fought, in which Pontius and 7000 men were forced to lay  down their arms and pass under the yoke in their turn. The struggle  between these two fierce nations lasted altogether seventy years, and  the Romans had many defeats. They had other wars at the same time. They  never subdued Etruria, and in the battle of Sentinum, fought with the  Gauls, the consul Decius Mus, devoted himself exactly as his father had  done at Vesuvius, and by his death won the victory.    The Samnite wars may be considered as ending in 290, when the chief  general of Samnium, Pontius Telesimus, was made prisoner and put to  death at Rome. The lands in the open country were quite subdued, but  many Samnites still lived in the fastnesses of the Apennines in the  south, which have ever since been the haunt of wild untamed men.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER XVI.    THE WAR WITH PYRRHUS.    B.C. 280-271.      In the Grecian History you remember that Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, the  townsman of Alexander the Great, made an expedition to Italy. This was  the way it came about. The city of Tarentum was a Spartan colony at the  head of the gulf that bears its name. It was as proud as its parent, but  had lost all the grave sternness of manners, and was as idle and fickle  as the other places in that languid climate. The Tarentines first  maltreated some Roman ships which put into their gulf, and then insulted  the ambassador who was sent to complain. Then when the terrible Romans  were found to be really coming to revenge their honor, the Tarentines  took fright, and sent to beg Pyrrhus to come to their aid.    He readily accepted the invitation, and coming to Italy with 28,000 men  and twenty elephants, hoped to conquer the whole country; but he found  the Tarentines not to be trusted, and soon weary of entertaining him,  while they could not keep their promises of aid from the other Greeks of  Italy.    [Illustration: PYRRHUS.]    The Romans marched against him, and there was a great battle on the  banks of the river Siris, where the fighting was very hard, but when the  elephants charged the Romans broke and fled, and were only saved by  nightfall from being entirely destroyed. So great, however, had been  Pyrrhus' loss that he said, \"Such another victory, and I shall have to  go back alone to Epirus.\"    He thought he had better treat with the Romans, and sent his favorite  counsellor Kineas to offer to make peace, provided the Romans would  promise safety to his Italian allies, and presents were sent to the  senators and their wives to induce them to listen favorably. People in  ancient Greece expected such gifts to back a suit; but Kineas found that  nobody in Rome would hear of being bribed, though many were not  unwilling to make peace. Blind old Appius Claudius, who had often been  consul, caused himself to be led into the Senate to oppose it, for it  was hard to his pride to make peace as defeated men. Kineas was much  struck with Rome, where he found a state of things like the best days of  Greece, and, going back to his master, told him that the senate-house  was like a temple, and those who sat there like an assembly of kings,  and that he feared they were fighting with the Hydra of Lerna, for as  soon as they had destroyed one Roman army another had sprung up in its  place.    However, the Romans wanted to treat about the prisoners Pyrrhus had  taken, and they sent Caius Fabricius to the Greek camp for the purpose.  Kineas reported him to be a man of no wealth, but esteemed as a good  soldier and an honest man. Pyrrhus tried to make him take large  presents, but nothing would Fabricius touch; and then, in the hope of  alarming him, in the middle of a conversation the hangings of one side  of the tent suddenly fell, and disclosed the biggest of all the  elephants, who waved his trunk over Fabricius and trumpeted  frightfully. The Roman quietly turned round and smiled as he said to the  king, \"I am no more moved by your gold than by your great beast.\"    [Illustration: ROMAN ORATOR.]    At supper there was a conversation on Greek philosophy, of which the  Romans as yet knew nothing. When the doctrine of Epicurus was mentioned,  that man's life was given to be spent in the pursuit of joy, Fabricius  greatly amused the company by crying out, \"O Hercules! grant that the  Greeks may be heartily of this mind so long as we have to fight with  them.\"    Pyrrhus even tried to persuade Fabricius to enter his service, but the  answer was, \"Sir. I advise you not; for if your people once tasted of my  rule, they would all desire me to govern them instead of you.\" Pyrrhus  consented to let the prisoners go home, but, if no peace were made, they  were to return again as soon as the Saturnalia were over; and this was  faithfully done. Fabricius was consul the next year, and thus received a  letter from Pyrrhus' physician, offering for a reward to rid the Romans  of his master by poison. The two consuls sent it to the king with the  following letter:--\"Caius Fabricius and Quintus AEmilius, consuls, to  Pyrrhus, king, greeting. You choose your friends and foes badly. This  letter will show that you make war with honest men and trust rogues and  knaves. We tell you, not to win your favor, but lest your ruin might  bring on the reproach of ending the war by treachery instead of force.\"    Pyrrhus made enquiry, put the physician to death, and by way of  acknowledgment released the captives, trying again to make peace; but  the Romans would accept no terms save that he should give up the  Tarentines and go back in the same ships. A battle was fought in the  wood of Asculum. Decius Mus declared he would devote himself like his  father and grandfather; but Pyrrhus heard of this, and sent word that he  had given orders that Decius should not be killed, but taken alive and  scourged; and this prevented him. The Romans were again forced back by  the might of the elephants, but not till night fell on them. Pyrrhus had  been wounded, and hosts of Greeks had fallen, among them many of  Pyrrhus' chief friends.    He then went to Sicily, on an invitation from the Greeks settled there,  to defend them from the Carthaginians; but finding them as little  satisfactory as the Italian Greeks, he suddenly came back to Tarentum.  This time one of the consuls was Marcus Curius--called Dentatus, because  he had been born with teeth in his mouth--a stout, plain old Roman, very  stern, for when he levied troops against Pyrrhus, the first man who  refused to serve was punished by having his property seized and sold. He  then marched southward, and at Beneventum at length entirely defeated  Pyrrhus, and took four of his elephants. Pyrrhus was obliged to return  to Epirus, and the Roman steadiness had won the day after nine years.    Dentatus had the grandest triumph that had ever been known at Rome,  with the elephants walking in the procession, the first that the Romans  had ever seen. All the spoil was given up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16672"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#13)"],[1,"(Waiyau),[11] or pretended  Mazitu, had tried to cross the Rovuma from the north bank. They came  as plunderers, and Musa having received no assistance was now ready to  defend the goods. A shot or two from the people of Kitwanga made the  Wanindi desert after they had entered the water.    Six sepoys and Simon had come up this length; Reuben and Mabruki  reported Richard to be dead. This poor boy was left with the others at  Liponde, and I never saw him again. I observed him associating too  much with the sepoys; and often felt inclined to reprove him, as their  conversation is usually very bad, but I could not of my own knowledge  say so. He came on with the others as far as Hassane or Pachassane:  there he was too weak to come further, and as the sepoys were  notoriously skulkers, I feared that poor Richard was led away by them,  for I knew that they had made many attempts to draw away the other  Nassick boys from their duty. When, however, Abraham came up and  reported Richard left behind by the sepoys, I became alarmed, and sent  off three boys with cordials to help him on: two days after Abraham  left he seems to have died, and I feel very sorry that I was not there  to do what I could. I am told now that he never consented to the sepoy  temptation: he said to Abraham that he wished he were dead, he was so  much troubled. The people where he died were not v$ry civil to Simon.    The sepoys had now made themselves such an utter nuisance that I felt  that I must take the upper hand with them, so I called them up this  morning, and asked if they knew the punishment they had incurred by  disobeying orders, and attempting to tamper with the Nassick boys to  turn them back. I told them they not only remained in the way when  ordered to march, but offered eight rupees to Ali to lead them to the  coast, and that the excuse of sickness was nought, for they had eaten  heartily three meals a day while pretending illness. They had no  excuse to offer, so I disrated the naik or corporal, and sentenced the  others to carry loads; if they behave well, then they will get fatigue  pay for doing fatigue duty, if ill, nothing but their pay. Their limbs  are becoming contracted from sheer idleness; while all the other men  are well and getting stronger they alone are disreputably slovenly and  useless-looking. Their filthy habits are to be reformed, and if found  at their habit of sitting down and sleeping for hours on the march, or  without their muskets and pouches, they are to be flogged. I sent two  of them back to bring up two comrades, left behind yesterday. All who  have done work are comparatively strong.    [We may venture a word in passing on the subject of native recruits,  enlisted for service in Africa, and who return thither after a long  absence. All the Nassick boys were native-born Africans, and yet we  see one of them succumb immediately. The truth is that natives; under  these circumstances, are just as liable to the effects of malaria on  landing as Europeans, although it is not often that fever assumes a  dangerous form in such cases. The natives of the interior have the  greatest dread of the illnesses which they say are sure to be in store  for them if they visit the coast.]    _19th June, 1866._--I gave the sepoys light loads in order to inure  them to exercise and strengthen them, and they carried willingly so  long as the fright was on them, but when the fear of immediate  punishment wore off they began their skulking again. One, Perim,  reduced his load of about 20 lbs. of tea by throwing away the lead in  which it was rolled, and afterwards about 15 lbs. of the tea, thereby  diminishing our stock to 5 lbs.    [Dr. Livingstone's short stay in England in 1864-5 was mainly taken up  with compiling an account of his travels on the Zambesi and Shire:  during this time his mother expired in Scotland at a good old age.  When he went back to Africa he took with him, as part of his very  scanty travelling equipment, a number of letters which he received  from friends at different times in England, and he very often quoted  them when he had an opportunity of sending letters home. We come to an  entry at this time which shows that in these reminiscences he had not  thus preserved an unmixed pleasure. He says:--]    I lighted on a telegram to-day:--\"Your mother died at noon on the 18th  June.\"    This was in 1865: it affected me not a little.

I may mention here that we saw  others tied up in a similar manner, and one lying in the path shot or  stabbed[12], for she was in a pool of blood. The explanation we got  invariably was that the Arab who owned these victims was enraged at  losing his money by the slaves becoming unable to march, and vented  his spleen by murdering them; but I have nothing more than common  report in support of attributing this enormity to the Arabs.    _20th June, 1866._--Having returned to Metaba, we were told by  Kinazombe, the chief, that no one had grain to sell but himself. He  had plenty of powder and common cloth from the Arabs, and our only  chance with him was parting with our finer cloths and other things  that took his fancy. He magnified the scarcity in front in order to  induce us to buy all we could from him, but he gave me an ample meal  of porridge and guinea-fowl before starting.    _21st June, 1866._--We had difficulties about carriers, but on  reaching an island in the Rovuma, called Chimiki, we found the people  were Makoa and more civil and willing to work than the Waiyau: we sent  men back to bring up the havildar to a very civil headman called  Chirikaloma.    _22nd June, 1866._--A poor little boy with prolapsus ani was carried  yesterday by his mother many a weary mile, lying over her right  shoulder--the only position he could find ease in,--an infant at the  breast occupied the left arm, and on her head were carried two  baskets. The mother's love was seen in binding up the part when we  halted, whilst the coarseness of low civilization was evinced in the  laugh with which some black brutes looked at the sufferer.    _23rd June, 1866._--The country is covered with forest, much more open  than further east. We are now some 800 feet above the sea. The people  all cultivate maize near the Rovuma, and on islands where moisture  helps them, nearly all possess guns, and plenty of powder and fine  beads,--red ones strung on the hair, and fine blue ones in rolls on  the neck, fitted tightly like soldiers' stocks. The lip-ring is  universal; teeth filed to points.    _24th June, 1866._--Immense quantities of wood are cut down, collected  in heaps, and burned to manure the land, but this does not prevent the  country having an appearance of forest. Divine service at 8.30 A.M.;  great numbers looking on. They have a clear idea of the Supreme Being,  but do not pray to Him.. Cold south winds prevail; temp. 55 deg. One of  the mules is very ill--it was left with the havildar when we went back  to Ngozo, and probably remained uncovered at night, for as soon as we  saw it, illness was plainly visible. Whenever an animal has been in  their power the sepoys have abused it. It is difficult to feel  charitably to fellows whose scheme seems to have been to detach the  Nassick boys from me first, then, when the animals were all killed,  the Johanna men, afterwards they could rule me as they liked, or go  back and leave me to perish; but I shall try to feel as charitably as  I can in spite of it all, for the mind has a strong tendency to brood  over the ills of travel. I told the havildar when I came up to him at  Metaba what I had done, and that I was very much displeased with the  sepoys for compassing my failure, if not death; an unkind word had  never passed my lips to them: to this he could bear testimony. He  thought that they would only be a plague and trouble to me, but he  \"would go on and die with me.\"    Stone boiling is unknown in these countries, but ovens are made in  anthills. Holes are dug in the ground for baking the heads of large  game, as the zebra, feet of elephants, humps of rhinoceros, and the  production of fire by drilling between the palms of the hands is  universal. It is quite common to see the sticks so used attached to  the clothing or bundles in travelling; they wet the blunt end of the  upright stick with the tongue, and dip it in the sand to make some  particles of silica adhere before inserting it in the horizontal  piece. The wood of a certain wild fig-tree is esteemed as yielding  fire readily.    In wet weather they prefer to carry fire "]]]
