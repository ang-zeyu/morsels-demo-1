Buz, buz, buz! Amid just such a murmur has Master Cheever  spent above sixty years: and long habit has made it as pleasant to him as  the hum of a bee-hive, when the insects are busy in the sunshine.    Now a class in Latin is called to recite. Forth steps a row of  queer-looking little fellows, wearing square-skirted coats, and small  clothes, with buttons at the knee. They look like so many grandfathers in  their second childhood. These lads are to be sent to Cambridge, and  educated for the learned professions. Old Master Cheever has lived so  long, and seen so many generations of school-boys grow up to be men, that  now he can almost prophesy what sort of a man each boy will be. One urchin  shall hereafter be a doctor, and administer pills and potions, and stalk  gravely through life, perfumed with assaf[oe]tida. Another shall wrangle  at the bar, and fight his way to wealth and honors, and in his declining  age, shall be a worshipful member of his Majesty's council. A third--and he  is the Master's favorite--shall be a worthy successor to the old Puritan  ministers, now in their graves; he shall preach with great unction and  effect, and leave volumes of sermons, in print and manuscript, for the  benefit of future generations.    But, as they are merely school-boys now, their business is to construe  Virgil. Poor Virgil, whose verses, which he took so much pains to polish,  have been mis-scanned, and mis-parsed, and mis-interpreted, by so many  generations of idle school-boys! There, sit down, ye Latinists. Two or  three of you, I fear, are doomed to feel the master's ferule.    Next comes a class in Arithmetic. These boys are to be the merchants,  shop-keepers, and mechanics, of a future period. Hitherto, they have  traded only in marbles and apples. Hereafter, some will send vessels to  England for broadcloths and all sorts of manufactured wares, and to the  West Indies for sugar, and rum, and coffee. Others will stand behind  counters, and measure tape, and ribbon, and cambric, by the yard. Others  will upheave the blacksmith's hammer, or drive the plane over the  carpenter's bench, or take the lapstone and the awl, and learn the trade  of shoe-making. Many will follow the sea, and become bold, rough  sea-captains.    This class of boys, in short, must supply the world with those active,  skilful hands, and clear, sagacious heads, without which the affairs of  life would be thrown into confusion, by the theories of studious and  visionary men. Wherefore, teach them their multiplication table, good  Master Cheever, and whip them well, when they deserve it; for much of the  country's welfare depends on these boys!    But, alas! while we have been thinking of other matters, Master Cheever's  watchful eye has caught two boys at play. Now we shall see awful times!  The two malefactors are summoned before the master's chair, wherein he  sits, with the terror of a judge upon his brow. Our old chair is now a  judgment-seat. Ah, Master Cheever has taken down that terrible birch-rod!  Short is the trial--the sentence quickly passed--and now the judge prepares  to execute it in person. Thwack! thwack! thwack! In those good old times,  a school-master's blows were well laid on.    See! the birch-rod has lost several of its twigs, and will hardly serve  for another execution. Mercy on us, what a bellowing the urchins make! My  ears are almost deafened, though the clamor comes through the far length  of a hundred and fifty years. There, go to your seats, poor boys; and do  not cry, sweet little Alice; for they have ceased to feel the pain, a long  time since.    And thus the forenoon passes away. Now it is twelve o'clock. The master  looks at his great silver watch, and then with tiresome deliberation, puts  the ferule into his desk. The little multitude await the word of  dismissal, with almost irrepressible impatience.    \"You are dismissed,\" says Master Cheever.    The boys retire, treading softly until they have passed the threshold;  but, fairly out of the school-room, lo, what a joyous shout!--what a  scampering and trampling of feet!--what a sense of recovered freedom,  expressed in the merry uproar of all their voices! What care they for the  ferule and birch-rod now? Were boys created merely to study Latin and  Arithmetic? No; the better purposes of their being are to sport, to leap,  to run, to shout, to slide upon the ice, to snow-ball!    Happy boys! Enjoy your play-time now, and come again to study, and to feel  the birch-rod and the ferule, to-morrow; not till to-morrow, for to-day is  Thursday-lecture; and ever since the settlement of Massachusetts, there  has been no school on Thursday afternoons. Therefore, sport, boys, while  you may; for the morrow cometh, with the birch-rod and the ferule; and  after that, another Morrow, with troubles of its own.    Now the master has set every thing to rights, and is ready to go home to  dinner. Yet he goes reluctantly. The old man has spent so much of his life  in the smoky, noisy, buzzing school-room, that, when he has a holiday, he  feels as if his place were lost, and himself a stranger in the world. But,  forth he goes; and there stands our old chair, vacant and solitary, till  good Master Cheever resumes his seat in it to-morrow morning.        \"Grandfather,\" said Charley, \"I wonder whether the boys did not use to  upset the old chair, when the school-master was out?\"    \"There is a tradition,\" replied Grandfather, \"that one of its arms was  dislocated, in some such manner. But I cannot believe that any school-boy  would behave so naughtily.\"    As it was now later than little Alice's usual bedtime, Grandfather broke  off his narrative, promising to talk more about Master Cheever and his  scholars, some other evening.          Chapter IV      Accordingly the next evening, Grandfather resumed the history of his  beloved chair.    \"Master Ezekiel Cheever,\" said he, \"died in 1707, after having taught  school about seventy years. It would require a pretty good scholar in  arithmetic to tell how many stripes he had inflicted, and how many  birch-rods he had worn out, during all that time, in his fatherly  tenderness for his pupils. Almost all the great men of that period, and  for many years back, had been whipt into eminence by Master Cheever.  Moreover, he had written a Latin Accidence, which was used in schools more  than half a century after his death; so that the good old man, even in his  grave, was still the cause of trouble and stripes to idle school-boys.\"    Grandfather proceeded to say, that, when Master Cheever died, he  bequeathed the chair to the most learned man that was educated at his  school, or that had ever been born in America. This was the renowned  Cotton Mather, minister of the Old North Church in Boston.    \"And author of the Magnalia, Grandfather, which we sometimes see you  reading,\" said Laurence.    \"Yes, Laurence,\" replied Grandfather. \"The Magnalia is a strange, pedantic  history, in which true events and real personages move before the reader,  with the dreamy aspect which they wore in Cotton Mather's singular mind.  This huge volume, however, was written and published before our chair came  into his possession. But, as he was the author of more books than there  are days in the year, we may conclude that he wrote a great deal, while  sitting in this chair.\"    \"I am tired of these school-masters and learned men,\" said Charley. \"I  wish some stirring man, that knew how to do something in the world, like  Sir William Phips, would set in the chair.\"    \"Such men seldom have leisure to sit quietly in a chair,\" said  Grandfather. \"We must make the best of such people as we have.\"    As Cotton Mather was a very distinguished man, Grandfather took some pains  to give the children a lively conception of his character. Over the door  of his library were painted these words--BE SHORT--as a warning to visitors  that they must not do the world so much harm, as needlessly to interrupt  this great man's wonderful labors. On entering the room you would probably  behold it crowded, and piled, and heaped with books. There were huge,  ponderous folios and quartos, and little duodecimos, in English, Latin,  Greek, Hebrew, Chaldaic, and all other languages, that either originated  at the confusion of Babel, or have since come into use.    All these books, no doubt, were tossed about in confusion, thus forming a  visible emblem of the manner in which their contents were crowded into  Cotton Mather's brain. And in the middle of the room stood a table, on  which, besides printed volumes, were strewn manuscript sermons, historical  tracts, and political pamphlets, all written in such a queer, blind,  crabbed, fantastical hand, that a writing-master would have gone raving  mad at the sight of them. By this table stood Grandfather's chair, which  seemed already to have contracted an air of deep erudition, as if its  cushion were stuffed with Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and other hard  matters.    In this chair, from one year's end to another, sat that prodigious  book-worm, Cotton Mather, sometimes devouring a great book, and sometimes  scribbling one as big. In Grandfather's younger days, there used to be a  wax figure of him in one of the Boston museums, representing a solemn,  dark-visaged person, in a minister's black gown, and with a black-letter  volume before him.    \"It is difficult, my children,\" observed Grandfather, \"to make you  understand such a character as Cotton Mather's, in whom there was so much  good, and yet so many failings and frailties. Undoubtedly, he was a pious  man. Often he kept fasts; and once, for three whole days, he allowed  himself not a morsel of food, but spent the time in prayer and religious  meditation. Many a live-long night did he watch and pray. These fasts and  vigils made him meagre and haggard, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15699"],[0,"A Handbook of the Boer War (#13)"],[1,"of the Boer forces. His Head-Quarters were at Brown's  Drift on the Modder, six miles from the key of the position on  Magersfontein. The sound of the bombardment notified him that an  infantry attack was imminent, and he hurried off to make the final  arrangements for meeting it. These he seems to have completed to his  satisfaction, and he rested for an hour or two, rising soon after  midnight. In the darkness and rain he lost his way on the unfamiliar  ground. But chance found him at daybreak close to the gap which Wilson's  little band of Highlanders had hewn in his line, and their promising  advance was effectually repressed, as they were simultaneously fired on  by Cronje's escort on their front and by a commando which had come up on  their right rear.    Daylight found the shattered and dismembered Highland Brigade lying in  patches upon the veld, with their leader dead before their eyes;  themselves unable to advance or retreat, conspicuous, hungry, thirsty,  and soon to be scorched by the midsummer sun at the zenith; and there  they lay for eight hours. Only the shells of the artillery, which from  daylight onwards played upon the trenches and partially mastered the  fire from them, saved the Highland Brigade from destruction.    The Guards' Brigade under Colvile was in the first instance detailed as  the reserve of the Highland Brigade, but the repulse of the latter and  the probability that it would sooner or later be compelled to retreat  gave the former a definite objective, the low arc held by the left of  the Boer line. In marching on this the wire fence which was the boundary  between British territory and the Orange Free State was crossed, and the  Guards' Brigade had the honour of being the first body of troops to go  into action in the enemy's country. Colvile held his own, but although  he was unable to occupy the arc he screened the right flank of the  Highlanders. On their left a weak Brigade under Pole-Carew was drawn up  astride the railway, and thus apparently the firing line, which had been  so hardly pressed during so many weary hours, was secure on either  flank. But Pole-Carew was paralysed by the variety of the duties which  had been assigned to him, and was unable to operate offensively on the  enemy's right. His original orders were to act as camp guard and to  demonstrate northwards in support of the Highland Brigade; and  subsequently he seems to have been instructed to hold himself in  readiness to cross over to support the Guards' attack on the enemy's  left, with the result that his Brigade was never seriously engaged.    The interval between the Highlanders' right facing the trenches and the  Guards' left had never been effectively closed and early in the  afternoon the Boers renewed their attacks upon it, and threatened to  enfilade the line. Hughes-Hallett, who after the death of Wauchope  succeeded to the command of the Highland Brigade and to whom Methuen had  sent orders to hold on until nightfall, asked Colvile in vain to support  him and at last was compelled to throw back his right. Methuen's orders  were unfortunately known only to Hughes-Hallett and the movement was  interpreted as an order from the brigadier for a general retirement. The  wave of retreat beginning on the right passed rapidly down the line, and  soon all but a few score of men who held on gallantly as long as there  was light were streaming back in confusion to the field batteries in  rear. Even the shelter of the guns did not wholly avail them for  protection, for they were shelled while rallying by the Boer guns which  had been strangely silent during the battle; and the retreat was  continued to the bivouac ground which so many more of them, now lying on  the veld, had quitted seventeen hours before. The battle was lost.    It is probable that if the work had been more evenly distributed the  result might have been, at least, less disastrous. An intolerable strain  was put upon one Brigade which it was unable to bear. The Highlanders  were blundered into action, then abandoned to their fate for many hours,  and finally withdrawn by a misunderstanding. The inequality of the tasks  set to the various columns is strikingly shown in the return of  casualties. To the total of 948 killed and wounded the Highland Brigade  contributed no less than 752. Two of its battalions lost 37 per cent of  their strength; while the losses of the Division were but 7 per cent.    Methuen's expectations that as at Modder River after the fight of  November 28 so also at Magersfontein the Boers would evacuate their  positions during the night were not realized. Next day he retired to the  Modder River Camp, where he received orders from Buller either to attack  Cronje again or to fall back upon the Orange River; but at the instance  of Forestier-Walker, who was in command of the Lines of Communication,  the orders were cancelled and Methuen was allowed to remain.    Magersfontein of itself would probably have sufficed to disarrange the  plans of Duller in Natal, but coming a few hours after a serious rebuff  in the centre, of which the story must now be told, it loomed fearfully  on his near horizon. Soon after he landed at Capetown he ordered the  weak and vulnerable detachments at Naauwpoort and Stormberg to be  withdrawn to De Aar and Queenstown. The movement opened to the enemy the  gates of access to a district in the Cape Colony teeming with Dutch  disaffection. The Free Staters, however, did not avail themselves of the  opportunity with alacrity, as they were more or less committed to  defensive action within their own territory; and a fortnight elapsed  before Colesberg was occupied by a force under the command of a  Transvaaler named Schoeman, who on November 1 had crossed the Orange  River at Norval's Pont. A few days later the Colesberg district was  formally annexed by proclamation to the Orange Free State and the  transfer of allegiance was enthusiastically approved by a public meeting  held at Colesberg on November 14. This action not only brought the  inhabitants under the commando law of the adjacent Republic by which a  form of conscription was enforced, but also overcame the scruples of the  Free Staters who could still maintain that they were only engaged in  defending their own territory. Simultaneously Du Plooy with a commando  which had crossed at Bethulie annexed the Burghersdorp district; while  Olivier with a force mainly composed of colonial rebels took over on  behalf of the Free State all that remained of the border districts of  Cape Colony as far as Basutoland. By the end of November the easy  process of annexation by proclamation had augmented the territory of the  Orange Free State by about 7,000 square miles; and then almost as an  afterthought the burghers occupied the important strategic post of  Stormberg Junction.    To meet and if possible to thrust back these intrusions French was sent  to the Naauwpoort and Gatacre to the Stormberg district. Buller soon  found it necessary to order Naauwpoort to be re-occupied, as that town  would have afforded a useful base to the enemy from which the main line  of railway could be raided in the neighbourhood of De Aar. French  arrived at Naauwpoort on November 20 and was for some weeks engaged in  protecting the lines and in checking rebellion.    [Illustration: Stormberg.]    The little force of half a battalion of infantry which evacuated  Stormberg withdrew to Queenstown, where Gatacre arrived on November 18.  He intended to march on Stormberg as soon as he had collected a  sufficient force; his own Division, which he had brought out from  England, having been diverted to Natal. He soon advanced to Putterskraal  near Sterkstroom and about thirty miles from Stormberg, the occupation  of which by the enemy on November 25 prevented co-operation between him  and French at Naauwpoort.    Meanwhile rebellion was spreading, and owing to the dilatory  proclamation of Martial Law by the Cape Government, always reluctant to  take action which might wound the susceptibilities of the Dutch  population, it had assumed a formidable aspect. Buller was uneasy, and  although at first he had cautioned Gatacre to be careful he now  suggested his closing with the enemy.    On December 7, by which time considerable reinforcements had come in,  Gatacre felt himself strong enough to tackle Olivier at Stormberg. His  plan was to take his column by train as far as Molteno, whence a night  march of about eight miles would bring it into position for attacking  the Boer laager. The use of the railway would not only enable him to  strike more suddenly and with a greater chance of taking Olivier by  surprise but would also economise the strength of his force, a portion  of which having left the transports only a few days previously was not  yet in hard condition. The force with which he proposed to take  Stormberg amounted to 2,600 men, who detrained at Molteno soon after  sunset on December 9. Gatacre calculated that after a march of about six  hours he would be able to rush the position before dawn.    The Boers, to the number of 1,700 men, were in occupation of the  Kissieberg ridge, and of a nek which runs westward from its southern end  towards a higher hill overhanging Stormberg Junction called Rooi Kop.  Gatacre had originally intended to attack the Boer position frontally,  but the reports which he received on arrival at Molteno determined him  to turn it. The change of plan was not made known to all the troops,  with the result that the ambulance and ammunition wagons left the town  by the Stormberg road instead of by the Steynsburg road, along which the  rest of the column was marching to the new objective. No trustworthy  maps were available, and the enterprise was dependent for its success  upon the knowledge and fidelity of a sergeant of police and a few native  constables who acted as guides and who professed to know \"every inch of  the way.\""]]]
