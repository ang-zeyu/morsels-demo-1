We are, as I reckon, near Hispaniola, but there is  no saying which way we may drift; for these storms are almost  always changeable, and while we are running south at present, an  hour hence we may be going in the opposite direction.\"    For twenty-four hours the storm continued, with unabated fury. At  times it seemed impossible that the vessel could live, so  tremendous were the seas which struck and buffeted her. However,  being light in the water, and buoyant, she floated over it. During  the next night the wind sensibly abated, and although still blowing  with tremendous force, there was evidence, to the accustomed eyes  of the sailors, that the storm was well-nigh blowing itself out.  The sea, too, sensibly went down, although still tremendous; and  all began to hope that they would weather the gale, when one of the  sailors, who had crawled forward to the bow, shouted:    \"Breakers ahead!\"    It was now, fortunately, morning; although the darkness had been so  intense, since the storm began, that the difference between night  and day was faint, indeed. Still it was better, if danger were to  be met with, that there should be as much light as possible.    All hands looked out over the bows and saw, before them, a steep  coast rising both to the right and left.    \"It is all over with the ship,\" Gerald said to Ned, \"and I do not  think that there is a chance, even for you. The surf on those rocks  is terrible.\"    \"We must do our best,\" said Ned, \"and trust in God. You keep close  to me, Gerald, and when you want aid I will assist you as far as I  can. You swim fairly, but scarce well enough, unaided, to get  through that surf yonder.\"    The men, seeing that what appeared to be certain destruction stared  them in the face, now shook hands all round; and then, commending  their souls to God, sat down and waited for the shock.    When it came, it was tremendous. The masts snapped at the board,  like rotten sticks. The vessel shivered from stem to stern and,  drawing back for an instant, was again cast down with terrible  force; and, as if struck by lightning, parted amidships, and then  seemed to fall all to pieces, like a house of cards.    Ned and Gerald were standing, hand in hand, when the vessel struck;  and as she went to pieces, and they were precipitated into the  water, Ned still kept close to his friend, swimming side by side  with him. They soon neared the edge of the line where the waves  broke upon the rocks. Then Ned shouted to Gerald to coast along,  outside the broken water; for that there was no landing there, with  life. For upwards of an hour they swam on, outside the line of  surf. The sea, although tremendously high, did not break till it  touched a certain point, and the lads rose and fell over the great  billows. They had stripped off the greater portion of their  clothing, before the ship struck; and in the warm water had no  sensation of chill, and had nothing to fight against, but fatigue.    When they were in the hollow of the waves their position was easy  enough, and they could make each other hear, by shouting loudly.  When, however, they were on the crest of one of the mountainous  waves, it was a hard struggle for life. The wind blew with such  fury, taking the top of the water off in sheets, and scattering it  in fine spray, that the boys were nearly drowned; although they  kept their back to the wind, and held their breath as if diving,  except when necessary to make a gasp for air.    Gerald became weak and tired, at the end of the hour; but Ned kept  up his courage, and aided him by swimming by his side, and letting  Gerald put his hand upon his shoulder, every time that they were in  the hollows of the waves, so that he got a complete rest at these  periods.    At last, Ned thought he saw a passage between two of the big rocks,  through which it might be possible, he thought, that they might  swim, and so avoid the certain death which seemed to await them at  every other spot.    The passage was about 40 feet wide, and it was no easy matter to  calculate upon striking this, in so wild a sea. Side by side with  Gerald, Ned made for the spot, and at last swam to the edge of the  surf. Then a great wave came rolling in, and the boys, dizzy and  confused, half smothered and choking, were hurled with tremendous  force, through the great rocks, into comparatively calm water  beyond. Ned now seized Gerald's hair, for his friend was nearly  gone; and, turning aside from the direct line of the entrance,  found himself speedily in calm water, behind the line of rocks. A  few minutes' further struggle and the two boys lay on the beach,  well-nigh insensible after their great exertions.    After a while they recovered their strength and, with staggering  feet, made their way further inland.    \"I owe you my life, Ned,\" Gerald said. \"I never could have  struggled ashore; nor, indeed, kept myself up for half that time,  had it not been for your aid.\"    \"I am glad to have been able to help you,\" Ned said simply. \"We may  thank heaven that the storm had abated a little, in its force,  before the vessel struck; for had it been blowing as it was  yesterday, we could not have swum five minutes. It was just the  lowering of the wind that enabled us to swim without being drowned  by the spray. It was bad enough, as it was, on the top of the  waves; but, yesterday, it would have been impossible.\"    One of the first thoughts of the boys, upon fairly recovering  themselves, was to kneel down and thank God for having preserved  their lives; and then, having rested for upwards of an hour, to  recover themselves, they made their way inland.    \"Our dangers are by no means over, Gerald,\" Ned said. \"If this  island is, as I believe, a thickly cultivated one, and in the hands  of the Spaniards, it will go hard with us, if they find us, after  all the damage to their commerce which we have been inflicting, for  the last year.\"    Upon getting to some rising ground, they saw, to their surprise, a  large town lying on a bay in front of them. Instinctively they  paused at the sight, and both sat down, so as to be out of view of  any casual lookers on.    \"What are we to do, Ned?\" Gerald said. \"If we stay here, we shall  be starved. If we go into the town, we shall have our throats cut.  Which think you is the best?\"    \"I do not like either alternative,\" Ned said. \"See, inland there  are many high mountains, and even close to the town there appear to  be thickets and woods. There are houses, here and there, and no  doubt plantations. It seems to me that if we get round to that side  we may conceal ourselves; and it is hard, in a country like this,  if we cannot, at any rate, find fruit enough to keep us for some  time. And we had better wait till dark. Our white shoulders will be  seen at too far a distance, by this light.\"    Creeping into a thicket, the lads lay down and were soon sound  asleep; and it was night before they awoke, and looked out. All  signs of the storm had passed. The moon was shining calmly, the  stars were brilliant, and seemed to hang like lamps in the sky, an  effect which is only seen in tropical climes.    There were lights in the town, and these served as a sort of guide  to them. Skirting along at the top of the basin in which the town  lay, they passed through cultivated estates, picking some ears of  maize; thus satisfying their hunger, which was, when they started,  ravenous; for, during the storm, they had been unable to open the  hatchways, and had been supported only by a little biscuit, which  happened to be in the caboose on deck.    Towards morning they chose a spot in a thick plantation of trees,  about a mile and a half from the town; and here they agreed to  wait, for a while, until they could come to some decision as to  their course.    Three days passed without any change. Each night they stole out and  picked maize, pineapple, and melons in the plantations for their  subsistence; and as morning returned, went back to their hiding  place. Close to it a road ran along to a noble house, which stood  in some grounds at about a quarter of a mile from their grove.  Every morning they saw the owner of this house, apparently a man of  distinction, riding towards the town; and they concluded that he  was one of the great merchants of the place.    One day he came accompanied by a young lady, carried in a litter by  four slaves. The boys, who were weary of their solitude, pressed to  the edge of the thicket to obtain a clear view of this little  procession, which broke the monotony of their day.    \"Gerald,\" Ned exclaimed, grasping him by the arm, \"do you know, I  believe that the lady is the girl I picked out of the water, the  day we took that ship three months ago.\"    \"Do you think so?\" Gerald said. \"It is too far, surely, to see.\"    \"I do not know for certain,\" Ned answered, \"but methinks that I  cannot be mistaken.\"    \"Perhaps she would help us, or intercede for us,\" Gerald suggested.    \"Perhaps so,\" Ned said. \"At any rate, we will try. Tonight we will  make a move into the gardens of the house she came from, and will  hide there till we see her alone in the garden. Then I will sally  forth, and see how she takes it.\"    Accordingly, that night, after obtaining their supply of fruit, the  boys entered the enclosure When morning broke there was speedily a  stir, negroes and negresses went out to the fields, servants moved  hither and thither in the veranda outside the house, gardeners came  out and set to work at their vocations.    It was evident that the owner or his family was fond of gardening,  for everything was kept with beautiful order and regularity. Mixed  with the cactus, and other gaudy-flowering"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19207"],[0,"The Firelight Fairy Book (#13)"],[1,"like ten  thousand rockets, it rolled back along the sky to the east. The hands of  the clocks, which marked half-past two, whirred back to two o'clock in a  twinkling. And, sure enough, there was brave little Tilda standing alone  in a great field waiting for the dragon to come and take her away.  Lumbering heavily along like a monstrous turtle, and snorting blue  smoke, the dragon was advancing toward her.    Bobo ran down into the field and stood beside Tilda, ready to defend her  to the end.    The dragon came nearer and nearer. Suddenly, angered by the sight of  Bobo and his drawn sword, he roared angrily, but continued to approach.  Bobo struck at him with his sword. The blade broke upon his steely  scales. The dragon roared again. Now just as the dragon's mouth was its  widest, Bobo who had been searching his pockets desperately, hurled into  it the lost temper.    There was a perfectly terrific bang! as if a million balloons had blown  up all at once. For the dragon had blown up. The lost temper had  finished him. Only one fragment of him, a tiny bit of a claw, was ever  found.    Everybody, you may be sure, began to cry \"Hurrah\" and \"Hooray,\" and soon  they were firing off cannon and ringing all the bells. Then Tilda's  father took her in his arms, and told her that she was a real princess.  The Grand Cross of the Order of the Black Cat was conferred upon Bobo by  Princess Zenza, who also asked his pardon for having treated him so  shabbily. This Bobo gave readily. A wonderful fete was held. When the  rejoicings were over, Bobo and Tilda were married, and lived happily  together all their days.             THE ENCHANTED ELM      [Illustration: Young girl sitting in a tree.]      Once upon a time, while riding, a brave, young prince dashed merrily  ahead of his friends, and after galloping across a ploughed field,  turned his horse's head down a grassy road leading to a wood. For some  time he cantered easily along, expecting any moment to hear the shouts  and halloos of his friends following after; but they by mistake took  quite another road, and no sound except the pounding of his courser's  hoofs reached the Prince's ear. Suddenly an ugly snarl and a short bark  broke the stillness of the pleasant forest, and looking down, the Prince  saw a gray wolf snapping at his horse's heels.    Though the horse, wild with fear, threatened to run away any instant,  the Prince leaned over and struck the wolf with his whip.    Hardly had he done so, when an angry voice cried, \"How dare you strike  my pet?\"    A little distance ahead, a wicked old witch stood at one side of the  road. With its tail between its legs, the wolf cowered close to her  skirts, and showed its long yellow fangs.    \"Pet, indeed!\" cried the Prince. \"Keep him away from my horse or I will  strike him again.\"    \"At your peril, Prince,\" answered the witch. And then, as the Prince  turned his horse's head and galloped back, she called out, \"You shall  rue this day! You shall rue this day!\"    Now by the time the Prince had arrived at the ploughed field and the  great road again, his friends had galloped on so far that they were lost  to sight. Thinking that he might overtake them by following a shorter  road, he turned down a byway skirting the wood in which he had  encountered the enchantress. Presently he began to feel very thirsty.  Chancing to see an old peasant woman in the fields, the Prince called to  her and asked where he could find a roadside spring.    Now this old peasant woman was the wicked witch under another form.  Overjoyed at having the Prince fall so easily into her power, she  curtsied; and replied that within the wood was to be found the finest  spring in the country. Anxious not to lose time, the Prince begged her  to lead him to the water. Little did he know that the witch was leading  him back into the wood, and that she had just bewitched the water!    When they arrived at the pool, the Prince dismounted, and kneeling by  the brim, made a cup of his hands and drank till his thirst was  satisfied. He was just about to seize his horse again by the bridle and  put his foot into the stirrup, when a terrible pang shot through his  body, darkness swam before his eyes, his arms lengthened and became  branches, his fingers, twigs; his feet shot into the ground, and he  found himself turned into a giant elm.    A giant elm he was; a giant elm he remained. Unable to find him after a  long search, his friends gave him up for lost, and a new Prince ruled  over the land. Though the elm tried many times to tell passers-by of his  plight, none ever seemed to understand his words. Again and again, when  simple wood-cutters ventured into the great dark wood, he would tell  them his story and cry out, \"I am the Prince! I am the Prince!\" But the  wood-cutters heard only the wind stirring in the branches. Ah, how cold  it was in winter when the skies were steely black and the giant stars  sparkled icily! And how pleasant it was when spring returned, and the  gossipy birds came back again!    The first year a pair of wood-pigeons took to housekeeping in his  topmost branches. The Prince was glad to welcome them, for though denied  human speech, he understood the language of trees and birds. On  Midsummer Eve, the pigeons said to him, \"To-night the King of the Trees  comes through the wood. Do you not hear the stir in the forest? All the  real trees are preparing for the King's coming; they are shedding dead  leaves and shaking out their branches.\"    \"Tell me of the King,\" said the Prince.    \"He is tall and dark and strong,\" said the doves. \"He dwells in a great  pine in the North. On Midsummer Eve, he goes through the world to see if  all is well with the tree people.\"    \"Do you think he can help me?\" asked the Prince.    \"You might ask him,\" replied the doves.    The long, long twilight of Midsummer Eve came to a close; night folded  the world beneath its starry curtains. At twelve o'clock, though not a  breath of air was stirring, the trees were shaken as if by a mighty  wind, the rustling of the leaves blending into strange and lovely music,  and presently the King of the Trees entered the haunted wood. Even as  the wood-doves had said, he was tall and dark and stately.    \"Is all well with you, O my people?\" said the King, in a voice as sweet  and solemn as the wind in the branches on a summer's day.    \"Yes, all is well,\" answered the trees softly. Though some replied, \"I  have lost a branch\"; and a little tree called out unhappily, \"My  neighbors are shutting out all my sunlight.\"    \"Then fare ye well, my people, till next Midsummer Eve,\" said the  stately King. And he was about to stride onward through the dark wood  when the enchanted Prince called aloud to him!    \"Stay, O King of the Trees,\" cried the poor Prince. \"Hear me even though  I am not of your people. I am a mortal, a prince, and a wicked witch has  turned me into a tree. Can you not help me?\"    \"Alas, poor friend, I can do nothing,\" replied the King. \"However, do  not despair. In my travels through the world, I shall surely find  someone who can help you. Look for me on next Midsummer Eve.\"    So the great elm swayed his branches sadly, and the King went on his  way.    The winter came again, silent and dark and cold. At the return of  spring, a maiden who dwelt with a family of wood-cutters came often to  rest in the shade of the great tree. Her father had once been a rich  merchant, but evil times had overtaken him, and at his death the only  relatives who could be found to take care of the little girl were a  family of rough wood-cutters in the royal service. These grudging folk  kept the poor maiden always hard at work and gave her the most difficult  household tasks. The Prince, who knew the whole story, pitied her very  much, and ended by falling quite in love with her. As for the unhappy  maiden, it seemed to her that beneath the sheltering shade of the great  elm she enjoyed a peace and happiness to be found nowhere else.    Now it was the custom of the wood-men to cut down, during the summer,  such trees as would be needed for the coming winter, and one day the  wood-cutter in whose family the maiden dwelt announced his intention of  cutting down the great elm.    \"Not the great elm which towers above all the forest?\" cried the maiden.    \"Yes, that very tree,\" answered the woodcutter gruffly. \"To-morrow  morning we shall fell it to the ground, and to-morrow night we shall  build the midsummer fire with its smaller branches. What are you crying  about, you silly girl?\"    \"Oh, please don't cut the great elm!\" begged the good maiden.    \"Nonsense!\" said the wood-cutter. \"I wager you have been wasting your  time under its branches. I shall certainly cut the tree down in the  morning.\"    All night long, you may be sure, the maiden pondered on the best way to  save the great tree; and since she was as clever as she was good, she at  length hit upon a plan. Rising early on Midsummer Morn, she ran to the  forest, climbed the great elm, and concealed herself in its topmost  branches. She saw the rest of the wood beneath her, and the distant  peaks of the Adamant Mountains; and she rejoiced in the dawn songs of  the birds.    An hour after the sun had risen, she heard the voices of the wood-cutter  and his men as they came through the wood. Soon the band arrived at the  foot of the tree. Imagine the feelings of the poor Prince when he saw  the sharp axes at hand to cut him down!    \"I shall strike the first blow,\" said the chief wood-cutter, and he  lifted his axe in the air.    Suddenly from the tree-top a warning voice sang,--      \"Throw the axe down, harm not me.    I am an enchanted tree.    He who strikes shall breathe his last,    Before Midsummer Eve hath passed.\"    \"There is a spirit in the tree,\" cried the woodcutters, thoroughly  frightened. \"Let us hurry away from here before it does us a mischief.\"  And in spite of all the chief wood-cutter"]]]
